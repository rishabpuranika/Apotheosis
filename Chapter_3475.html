<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," No. 9527 mused jokingly, "that the Civilization Artifact starts talking nonsense after being burnt by the Evil God?"</p>

  <p>"Just verify it," Zheng responded bluntly. "It can issue a lot of tasks in one go."</p>

  <p>The heaven-level third-class task...</p>

  <p>The heaven-level fourth-class task...</p>

  <p>The earth-level first-class task...</p>

  <p>The earth-level second-class task...</p>

  <p>Gradually, Zheng began to understand the rules.</p>

  <p>Once the cube issued tasks, it would start from the heaven-level ones, which were categorized into four classes. Next came the earth-level ones, which were also categorized into four classes. Among all, the human-level tasks were the simplest.</p>

  <p>Zheng focused on the tasks being listed. At the end, he picked one task he felt suited for: a task at the fourth class of the human level.</p>

  <p>"The human-level fourth-class task," the voice boomed, "merge with the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. After you complete the task, your physical body will be strengthened."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in a satisfied manner. Other tasks might have various restrictions or were not suitable for him to complete, but he was confident he'd be able to accomplish this task.</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to reach the Chaotic Source Realm," he pondered. "Why is it a task at the fourth class of the human level?"</p>

  <p>The tasks were divided into twelve kinds. He didn't expect that reaching the Chaotic Source Realm would be the easiest.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit thought for a moment before replying. "The tasks should be ranked according to the current environment. You have already collected enough crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, so reaching the Chaotic Source Realm is too easy."</p>

  <p>"It's reasonable," Zheng said, nodding. "I'll accept this task."</p>

  <p>Strengthening his physical body was always a plus. Moreover, he wanted to confirm whether this Civilization Artifact was really magical or not.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body transformed into wisps of brown chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The moment he removed the avatar in his body, he was fully awakened.</p>

  <p>In a magic array not far from him, a ray of light suddenly flashed. A nonhuman stranger who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm was sent outside the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was busy with the matters within his inner world, there were already many people who had refined the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Zheng activated his space ring, pulling out the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits with one hand. With his other hand, he summoned the golden red crystals.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Zheng had also been quite surprised when he discovered the two different kinds of crystals in the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the auras of the golden red crystals were obviously thicker and more solid than those of normal crystals.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't kept all the crystals to himself. Yan received thirty of them, while Dorothy and Feng Ge got twelve. As for Chaim, Sally and the others, they each got three.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had also warned them not to refine the golden red crystals in the magic arrays, lest they contain poison or lead to any other dangerous situation.</p>

  <p>Although the magic arrays in the Chaotic Source World were complicated, the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill were able to arrange the same arrays. They could try refining the golden red crystals after the elders of their races inspected them.</p>

  <p>Zheng's corporeal body differed from an ordinary person's, so he was able to take on more.</p>

  <p>After hesitating for a bit, Zheng finally decided to refine the ordinary crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits first.</p>

  <p>Following in Sally's footsteps, he first put the crystals into his inner world, and then pushed them into his meridians.</p>

  <p>As the sharp crystals wandered in his body, he winced in pain.</p>

  <p>Zheng's corporeal body was comparable to a magic weapon, and there was much greater resistance to the crystals than in any ordinary body.</p>

  <p>The crystals slowly moved, and gradually scattered in every part of his body. Then, when he activated the magic array, his whole being was enveloped in a wave of light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>In the span of a few seconds, the once solid crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits began to melt, little by little. Beads of light melted off the crystals, merging with Zheng's corporeal body.</p>

  <p>Zheng closed his eyes. He could tangibly feel the dots of light being absorbed, completely under his control.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had effortlessly refined the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, the voice from before suddenly spoke up in his head once more.</p>

  <p>"You have completed the task at the fourth class of the human level," the Civilization Artifact of Heavenly Obsession Civilization said. "You will be rewarded with a stronger body."</p>

  <p>Zheng felt something stirring within him. Looking into his inner world, he saw a small, black dot of light rising from one side of the cube.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit had been standing beside the cube. Once the black dot popped up, they stared at it curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is this the reward of the Civilization Artifact?" the Regal Jade Spirit wondered, narrowing his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be some kind of energy. Can it strengthen the corporeal body?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 asked, puzzled as well.</p>

  <p>"I will try it," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Without further hesitation, he willed the small black dot of light to rise up and out of his inner world.</p>

  <p>Then it turned into a warm current, quietly integrating into Zheng's corporeal body. It flowed through his meridians for a lap, till the energy inside it had been used up.</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling now?" The Regal Jade Spirit asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's better than nothing!" Zheng shook his head and chuckled.</p>

  <p>He could feel that his corporeal body was strengthened, but only by a little.</p>

  <p>After all, it was but a simple task.</p>

  <p>After Zheng reached the Chaotic Source Realm, he felt a sudden fluctuation of the space in front of him, and the space channel was already shown.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't plan to leave immediately. This time, he placed the golden red crystals into his inner world.</p>

  <p>After the distribution of the golden red crystals, Zheng had reserved two hundred for himself.</p>

  <p>Just as he'd done before, he willed the golden red crystals to scatter in his limbs and bones. Then, he activated them.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The light of the magic array enveloped Zheng once more. However, something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"What the...?"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned slightly. These golden red crystals didn't melt easily, like the ordinary crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits had. They remained unharmed within his corporeal body, unresponsive to the energy from the magic array.</p>

  <p>The others around him exchanged confused glances as they noticed Zheng had once again activated the magic array. Some, however, figured out what he was up to.</p>

  <p>"Why did he activate the magic array again?"</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten what he gained from the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits?"</p>

  <p>"He has obtained some unique crystals. He's probably trying to refine them, too."</p>

  <p>Then, those people nodded, as they began to envy Zheng.</p>

  <p>To reach the Chaotic Source Realm was a great success. Moreover, Zheng had obtained extra crystals. How could they not be envious, if not in awe?</p>

  <p>After a while, the light from the magic array went out.</p>
