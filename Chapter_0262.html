<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 262 The Court Trial (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>From where he stood, Luo Zheng shot him a truly incredulous look.</p>

  <p>"Reason? You old thing! Only after I finished the trial for slaying demons, I was taken here by some people without any reason before going back to Drizzle Peak. They said without any evidence that I was a spy of the demons and beat me heavily with Murry, but they found they couldn't kill me easily. So, they ganged up with Fren to let me die! Do you think I would just stand there and let them kill me casually?</p>

  <p>Do you think I would die willingly?" Luo Zheng asked, fury and seriousness clouding his voice. "I want to know, if you were me, what would you do?" he added.</p>

  <p>However, Saint Viana only said, "Those are your own words! They are not believable!"</p>

  <p>After he said those words, he slowly flew from the air to the ground. He went to Murry, who had remained silent and looked deep in thought.</p>

  <p>"Murry, as a judge of Commandment Hall, it is your duty to explain clearly what has happened today!" Saint Viana said.</p>

  <p>At this, Murry rolled his eyes and a wicked grin was plastered on his face. "My honored Saint Viana, please don't believe this guy who told a lie. The information received by Commandment Hall indicated that the guy conspired with the demons during his trial for slaying demons, and as a judge of Commandment Hall, it is my responsibility to keep the disciples of Cloud Sect safe. However, if this boy was really possessed by a demon general and entered into our Cloud Sect, what should we do?</p>

  <p>Thus, I have to take some actions to find out if he is really a spy," he said.</p>

  <p>Saint Viana nodded in agreement. "Murry, you are right, please go on!" he said.</p>

  <p>"It was really unexpected that he didn't cooperate with us and he refused to be examined by Commandment Hall. What's worse, when he was in Commandment Hall, he has said something very offensive! Because of his arrogance and improper words, I asked to beat him to give him a lesson--but unfortunately, he turned around and ran away!</p>

  <p>Just at that moment, I met Fren who was passing by, so I asked him for help. However, I have never thought Luo Zheng would be so cruel!</p>

  <p>He killed Fren... You have witnessed all the following things, Saint Viana," Murry finished. A smirk was etched on his lips, because he knew that he was good at slandering other people's names. He was more than familiar with all the skills about framing other people. In addition to that, he had always harmed innocent people so it was a no-brainer for him to frame Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After Murry finished talking, Saint Viana turned to Saint Caspar.</p>

  <p>"Caspar, now you know that this boy killed Fren and he broke the rules of Cloud Sect, so please tell us how to punish him!" he said.</p>

  <p>Even from where he stood, Luo Zheng heard Murry's words and it made him mad with rage. "Murry, you are lying and you deliberately swap the right for wrong! Dare you swear what you have said is true?" he breathlessly asked.</p>

  <p>"If I, Murry, has told a lie, I will be struck and killed by lightning,"</p>

  <p>Murry simply swore with a smile. For him, to give such a swear came rather easy.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied?" he added.</p>

  <p>At this point, Saint Viana went back to his arrogant self. "This boy should be killed!" he declared.</p>

  <p>Their current situation put Saint Caspar in a dilemma. According to Murry's words, Luo Zheng had undeniably broken the rules and should be punished. As a saint of Cloud Sect, he understood the importance of following the rules in dealing with different matters from the establishment of Cloud Sect to its development, or the whole Cloud Sect would be out of order.</p>

  <p>If Murry's words were true, he would have no reason to protect Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What was more, Mu Ning was too straightforward which upset Caspar very much.</p>

  <p>However, Caspar didn't expect that Mu Ning would retort back. "Okay, so I ask to have a court trial for Luo Zheng!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Court trial?</p>

  <p>Well, it's easy to say!</p>

  <p>But who gave this boy the right to have a court trial of Cloud Sect?"</p>

  <p>Saint Viana said haughtily.</p>

  <p>The so-called "court trial" in Cloud Sect was mainly used to judge someone outstanding who seriously violated the rules, and had a controversial behavior. So far, the court trial had never been organized for an outer disciple.</p>

  <p>Only the elites of Cloud Sect were qualified enough to be judged through a court trial.</p>

  <p>The court trial requested by Mu Ning made Caspar feel uncomfortable and awkward. "The last court trial was just organized two years ago, and if we organize the court trial just for such a little thing, is it ...", he trailed off, supposed to ask a question.</p>

  <p>"I insist on having a court trial", Mu Ning still asserted firmly. "Saint Viana, you have thought it is indisputable to kill Luo Zheng. Are you now afraid to have the trail?" she added.</p>

  <p>"Afraid?" Saint Viana said mockingly and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why am I afraid to have the trail? I witnessed with my own eyes that Luo Zheng had killed Fren, so why I am afraid?" he continued.</p>

  <p>"Okay, now I am going to apply for the court trial, and I will do everything well so you two will not be bothered by the application,"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning said calmly. Her alluring but sharp eyes glittered with a hint of cunningness.</p>

  <p>"Well, let the boy live two more days, but he must be kept in Commandment Mount and you can't take him away!" Saint Viana ordered. In return, Mu Ning cast a comforting look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, you have to stay here for a couple of days, but don't worry, no one can frame you up once the court trial is organized!" she reassured him.</p>

  <p>A smile lit up Zheng's face as he looked at Mu Ning. "Master Su, I am not worried at all. My life is not valuable, and anyone can come to kill me on the condition that he is powerful enough!" he told her.</p>

  <p>As he said those words, Luo Zheng shot Saint Viana a knowing look.</p>

  <p>After that, Mu Ning maneuvered her flying chariot and landed it on the ground. Before the court trial, Luo Zheng had to be kept in Commandment Mount. A squadron of officers had arrived to take him away.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to be escorted to leave the scene, he suddenly thought of something. He turned to Mu Ning and asked her in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Master Su, could you tell me who was judged by the court trial two years ago?"</p>

  <p>His question had Mu Ning go quiet for a while before she answered, "Yan."</p>

  <p>At this, Luo Zheng managed to plaster a smile on his face. "Who held that court trial? And who prosecuted?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Can I tell you later?" Mu Ning said with a hint of discomfort in her voice.</p>

  <p>She shook her head and truthfully, she didn't want to answer his questions.</p>

  <p>"Please tell me," Luo Zheng begged in a calm but steadfast voice, as he stared at Mu Ning with burning eyes.</p>
