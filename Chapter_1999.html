<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1999 Plot To Kill Luo Luo Zheng </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength always surpassed Leroy's expectations and imagination. It was always a wonder to watch Luo Luo Zheng display his skills.</p>

  <p>Once the Faith Trial was activated, the Faith Bodies formed by the Faith Energy were extremely difficult to deal with.</p>

  <p>The reason was that they had a portion of the Demon Night queens' memories. To be specific, a portion of the strength of the martial arts they had cultivated before. Hence, it was not an exaggeration to say that their strength could be compared to that of grand world lords. After all, the overall strength of grand world lords was unimaginable.</p>

  <p>The Faith Body was only another way to utilize the Faith Energy. In a certain aspect, these Faith Bodies were indeed comparable to grand world lords.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng slayed down the thirteenth Queen of Killings, another Queen of Killings rushed forward in a lightning speed. The spear was burning with fire, harboring a vicious killing intent. The tip of the spear was pointed between Luo Zheng's eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly jumped up and snatched the spear in a blink of an eye. He twisted his body couple of times which confused the queen. He took advantage of the queen's brief moment of hesitation and grabbed her neck. A sickening sound was heard as he ruthlessly twisted her neck.</p>

  <p>"Thud!"</p>

  <p>The Queen of Killings instantly went limp and her form turned into streams of Faith Energy that flowed towards the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng kept destroying the Faith Bodies of Demon Night's queens like crushing dry weeds, Supreme Lord Leroy also acted fast alongside him.</p>

  <p>Although Leroy gave an impression of a skinny old man, he was exceptionally agile at this moment. He swiftly moved back and forth, with one hand holding onto the bow and the other plucking the string at such a rapid speed, that it looked like he was playing a musical instrument.</p>

  <p>A Scorching Sun Arrow would shoot out at each pull of the string. The moment the arrow pierced through a Faith Body, it would explode and the body would collapse instantly.</p>

  <p>The two of them hovered in the sky and one by one the Faith Bodies were slayed down. Leroy focused on killing Queens of Punishment and Queens of Life, while Luo Luo Zheng concentrated on the Queens of Killings.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A new Faith Body of a Queen of Killings came into existence. The crimson body turned and pointed a spear towards Luo Luo Zheng. The spear's tip produced an invisible force that pierced through the air.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng did not dodge this time, allowing this force to collide with his body. An explosive sound could be heard, but his body was completely unharmed. Luo Luo Zheng rushed towards the Queen of Killings to crush the Faith Body.</p>

  <p>However, as he got closer, he could not believe his eyes!</p>

  <p>Through the maze of red light, Luo Luo Zheng realized that the queen facing him was none other than Xun!</p>

  <p>This Inauguration Altar had memories, and when every queen came to the throne, they would be accurately recorded by the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>After the Faith Trial was activated, every queen of the Demon Night could reveal themselves to protect the Inauguration Altar and Xun exactly did the same.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was at a loss, looking at the Faith Body of Xun.</p>

  <p>While he was slightly stunned for a moment, Xun had already raised her spear and pointed it towards Luo Luo Zheng. The Mu Ning that emitted from that blurry form was no different from that of the real Xun!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to be in a daze, when a ray of golden light suddenly shot out from beside his ear. Leroy's arrow had accurately pierced through Xun's Faith Body, dissipating the form in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't be fooled by these Faith Bodies," Leroy reminded him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow creased slightly as he quickly thought and asked, "Does this Inauguration Altar contain all of the queens' memories?"</p>

  <p>Leroy shrugged. "Who knows? Except for the queens, no one has ever entered the Inauguration Altar."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up when he saw some possibilities from Supreme Lord Leroy's uncertainty.</p>

  <p>At this stage, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find a way to restore Xun's memories.</p>

  <p>Right now, Xun was just like a puppet, and he didn't know what to do with her. If only he could restore Xun's memories in the Inauguration Altar!</p>

  <p>From the way these Faith Bodies fought, Luo Luo Zheng was sure the Inauguration Altar would have a portion of memories of the queens. For instance, from the way Xun's Faith Body thrust out the spear, Luo Luo Zheng could make out the spear skills Xun had cultivated. But whether the Inauguration Altar had the complete memories of Xun could only depend on luck!</p>

  <p>The Faith Trial was still a great threat to world lords and grand world lords. However, it wouldn't be a threat to Supreme Lords or Luo Luo Zheng. But unless they got rid of all these Faith Bodies, they wouldn't be able to enter the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night queens of every generation appeared one by one and was simultaneously killed. From the ancient time till now, no one knew how many queens were there in the Demon Night to carry on the thrones.</p>

  <p>If calculated carefully, a common grand world lord usually had a lifespan of tens of millions of years. In these billions of years, as time slowly flowed by, the total number of queens in Demon Night would probably be over a thousand!</p>

  <p>The battle at the Inauguration Altar had quickly alarmed the nine tenth grade sacred places in the Rosy Cloud World.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Demon Night members staying at the sacred places were all rushing towards the Inauguration Altar. There were actually a great number of grand world lords within those sacred places, who were all members of the Board of Elders.</p>

  <p>This time Yao and Ying had gone out for the war, but the Board of Elders didn't follow them. Neither did Yao and Ying force them to go with them. In Yao's eyes, the combat ability of the group of old fellows in the Board of Elders was not strong. Moreover, the Board of Elders was already at odds with her.</p>

  <p>High above in the sky of the Rosy Cloud World, two Supreme Lords were floating, calmly watching the scene below.</p>

  <p>There were a total of five Supreme Lords in the entire Demon Night race now. Besides Supreme Lord Leroy and Supreme Lord Leia, there were also Supreme Lord Humaira who was on Ying's side. The two Supreme Lords who were floating high in the sky over the Rosy Cloud World were Supreme Lord Korbin and Supreme Lord Shadow. The situation in the Demon Night race was rather special. Even Supreme Lords were not in a position to interfere in the wars among the queens.</p>

  <p>They had always remained neutral.</p>

  <p>"It seems like Leroy is very determined. He really plans on destroying the two Pools of Faith." Supreme Lord Korbin gazed down indifferently as a wisp of fire flickered in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I actually admire that guy," Supreme Lord Shadow laughed. "I think we should do something to help them. By now, Yao and Ying should be on their way back. Should we stop them?"</p>

  <p>"I will not interfere in their battle. You forget that we do not take anybody's side?" Supreme Lord Korbin said grimly.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow asked in bewilderment, "You're really going to watch the Demon Night race head for destruction?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin smiled. "Who said our Demon Night race will head for destruction? What if the human race fails?" Korbin asked with a gleam in his eye.</p>

  <p>Before this battle, Yao had already told the several Supreme Lords about the information in the Soul-sealing Needle. Supreme Lord Korbin and Supreme Lord Humaira also understood why Yao and Ying had suddenly changed their minds and joined hands with the Sacred race to attack the entire Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>From their point of view, Yao's choice wasn't completely wrong. If the Sacred race really destroyed this Evolutionary Universe, then their Demon Night race might be able to grab a place in this universe and even enter the Murphy Universe!</p>

  <p>As he heard this, Supreme Lord Shadow pointed a finger at Luo Luo Zheng below.</p>

  <p>With a malicious glint in his eyes, he said, "In that case, then let's join forces and kill that kid down there!"</p>

  <p>"Kill Luo Luo Zheng?" Supreme Lord Korbin raised his eyebrow.</p>

  <p>By now, the entire universe knew the value of Godly Geniuses and Luo Luo Zheng was ranked first among them. If he continued to develop like this, he might be the key to turn the situation around.</p>

  <p>Although it was only a casual conversation between the two Demon Night Supreme Lords, their attitudes seemed critical.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Leroy realized that it would not be so easy to break down the Pools of Faith after he got Luo Luo Zheng here. There were not just the two queens in the Demon Night, but also Supreme Lords. He had taken the advantage of issuing Xun's order to reach the purpose of splitting the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>His plan seemed to be working, as Supreme Lord Leia could no longer endure it and chose to leave Yao.</p>

  <p>But, Leroy's plan was also an extremely risky move. Rushing into the Inauguration Altar, Leroy had been confident that the other Supreme Lords would not interfere.</p>

  <p>However, the Supreme Lords who had chosen to take a neutral stance had their own judgment. Although they didn't support any queen, they would still take the interest of the Demon Night into consideration.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Shadow brought up the idea of killing Luo Luo Zheng, Supreme Lord Korbin began to carefully weigh the pros and cons.</p>

  <p>"Will the Sacred race win if we kill this kid?" Supreme Lord Korbin asked.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow shook his head slightly. "Maybe or maybe not, but judging from the reactions of the Celestial Position and the Sacred race, this kid is very important to them."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin looked down. "So then.. Kill him?"</p>

  <p>Saying this, he looked Luo Luo Zheng in a way as if he had already sentenced him to death.</p>
