<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1735 Zheng's Identity Was Revealed </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The cyan beam of light was so powerful. It felt as if it could split open space!</p>

  <p>This wasn't anything out of the ordinary though, considering that the Breeze Sword School leader was at the Spirit Transformation Realm. His inner world was already mature and his powers were understandably daunting.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Zheng huffed and raised his hand. The Thunder Wind Divine Sword released a slash of its own, countering the opposing cyan beam.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>The moment the two sword radiance beams collided, the surrounding space split into huge fragments. These fragments were visibly torn with their edges looking as if they had been bitten off by a large, celestial dog.</p>

  <p>For this attack, Zheng only used around eighty percent of his strength but it was enough to annihilate that cyan beam. He hadn't even employed the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike yet.</p>

  <p>The immediate vicinity was currently deserted since those who had been standing nearby immediately ran away to avoid getting in the middle of the crossfire. However, they maintained a close-enough distance to still watch what was happening.</p>

  <p>The Breeze Sword School leader was famous for his hot temper but they didn't need to be afraid since he wasn't mad at them. All of them wanted to see what would happen to this young man that had the unfortunate fate of angering the master.</p>

  <p>Zheng's counter of the master's attack shocked many in the audience.</p>

  <p>This young man was only at the early stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm but he was already able to counter the Breeze Sword School leader's powerful attack.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible..."</p>

  <p>"He's only at the Spirit Supreme Realm but he blocked the master's sword so easily.."</p>

  <p>"Is he an ace talent from some great power?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had encountered quite a few ace talents back in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>However, the chances of encountering an ace talent here outside the Illusion Battlefield were actually very low. There were 100, 000 supreme worlds and no more than 1000 ace talents in the universe which meant the probability of encountering one was actually less than meeting a Saint Lord of a sacred place!</p>

  <p>"He can't be! Why would an ace talent need a nine-star sword token to enter the Sword Manor? If he really was an ace talent then the Sword Manor leader himself would've personally come out to greet him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he'd be backed by Supreme Lords!"</p>

  <p>"Then who is this fellow..."</p>

  <p>The Breeze Sword School leader was equally surprised at what just transpired.</p>

  <p>A person at the Spirit Supreme Realm who could withstand and counter his strike must not be looked down upon. Zheng must at least be an ace talent if he was able to do that.</p>

  <p>The leader began to feel a bit strange especially since he noticed Zheng's composure which meant he hadn't used his full strength!</p>

  <p>However, this was still his territory and the effective counter of his strike just served to both humiliate and annoy him. He pushed aside all his earlier thoughts and prepared to give Zheng another strike, this time using his full strength!</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to raise his hand though, a powerful arm grabbed him!</p>

  <p>"Keane, no." It was the senior steward of the Sword Manor! He was Caiden Han who was responsible for communications with other sword schools outside of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>During the Illusion Battlefield matches, he paid close attention to all the events. The faces of all three hundred people in the picture were deeply imprinted in his mind, more so the top ten warriors.</p>

  <p>He felt Zheng was somewhat familiar at first glance when he had followed Keane here.</p>

  <p>It had been dark and it was difficult to really make out his face under the dim lamplight but he immediately recognized the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. When the Breeze Sword School leader launched the first attack, Caiden Han had a feeling it wouldn't end well.</p>

  <p>The moment he saw Zheng block the master's attack so easily, admiration bloomed in Caiden Han's heart. He was indeed worthy of his title of Illusion Battlefield champion, the main character of this era.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Breeze Sword School leader was about to raise his hand, Caiden Han naturally stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Why did you stop me?!" the leader burst out in anger. He had already been embarrassed so much but he at least should get an explanation. He didn't really care what reason Caiden Han had in stopping him but he at least wanted to find a way out and save his face.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you find his sword technique very special?" Caiden Han said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>The leader frowned. He thought about it for a second before his face suddenly darkened.</p>

  <p>Sword technique...</p>

  <p>This fellow cultivated Supreme Lord Sword's sword technique!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword was the Sword Manor's former leader. Using his own strength, he led the previously insignificant Sword Manor to greatness: ascending two levels and becoming the greatest force amongst the independent martial artists.</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor respected freedom and did not restrain independent martial artists nor expand their territory which meant they did not develop into a sacred place. However, its influence was long-standing and had since surpassed what normal, second-grade races normally had.</p>

  <p>There were countless sword techniques in the Sword Manor....</p>

  <p>However, there was one that was considered of the supreme level: Supreme Lord Sword's swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Supreme Lord Sword did not pass his swordsmanship down to anyone. The only thing he left behind was a poem in the Orange Sea World...</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor once sent a large number of warriors into the Orange Sea World in an attempt to figure out their old master's secret. Sadly, the warriors ultimately failed and returned to the Sword Manor with nothing.</p>

  <p>A few years ago, back when the Humanity Alliance still hadn't expelled the outsiders from their land, there were still some independent warriors who meditated there.</p>

  <p>In the end, nobody inherited Supreme Lord Sword's ultimate sword technique.</p>

  <p>However, the Sword Manor recently found a person who managed to almost perfectly hone Supreme Lord Sword's ultimate sword technique and used it in his battles in the Illusion Battlefield. That person was none other than Zheng!</p>

  <p>But wasn't Zheng supposed to be trapped in the Middle Sky Region?</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield just ended. Why in the world was he here? Did he perhaps come here to the Sword Manor? How in the world did he manage to get here so fast? Even a Supreme Lord couldn't have done that!</p>

  <p>The Breeze Sword School leader was a shrewd man. Since the person in front of him was Zheng, then this mishap would be easily handled.</p>

  <p>He would've been disgraced had it been an ordinary warrior of the Spirit Supreme Realm. His pride would never be able to take the knowledge of having lost to someone who was of a lower level than him.</p>

  <p>However, losing to Zheng was a different matter altogether. He was a legendary figure who was hailed as someone who would be the number one warrior of the universe in the future.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, the master let out a laugh. "Ha-ha! I was wondering who this person was. It turns out to be the Godly Genius,  Zheng Luo! You should have told us in advance that you were coming, young man! It is our fault that we failed to greet you in due manner. Forgive me. I lost my temper just now! I'm so sorry!" It was rare for someone of his status to apologize so quickly and humbly. The master would be lying if he said he wasn't feeling any embarrassment right now.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the name ' Zheng Luo' was enough to ease his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>So long as he revealed the young man's identity, then the master's face would be saved.</p>

  <p>Caiden Han also took a step forward. He cupped his hands in front of Zheng. "I am Caiden Han from the Sword Manor. A Godly Genius has come to visit us and we were so rude to you. We're so sorry. Please accept my apology."</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't really become a Godly Genius but that wasn't important.</p>

  <p>Since he defeated Godly Geniuses then he was someone who had the potential to become a True God in the future!</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>"The champion of the Illusion Battlefield!"</p>

  <p>"No way! But why would he come to our Sword Manor..."</p>

  <p>The crowd murmured in amazement upon realizing just who this young man was.</p>

  <p>A person like Zheng should've gone to the Celestial Position, the Thoughtless Minds, or the Humanity Alliance...</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor was nothing compared to these great powers. If Supreme Lord Sword was still around then it might still be considered as a place for Zheng to come to but since he was gone, there wasn't really any reason why he'd bother to be here.</p>

  <p>Two of the three warriors that Zheng attacked previously had now awoken but almost passed out again after hearing Caiden Han's words.</p>

  <p>'Damn! If you told us who you were earlier then we would've given you this nine-star sword token for free, ' they thought to themselves.</p>

  <p>However, they noticed something strange about this arrangement. 'Since you're Zheng, what did you need this nine-star sword token for? You could go straight to the Sword Manor and nobody will stop you!'</p>

  <p>The two continued to fume in their minds but did not dare show it in their faces. They hoped to the high heavens that Zheng would let them go otherwise the Breeze Sword School leader would blame them and that would be their end.</p>

  <p>One of the warriors was still unconscious and he was the one who dared to ask Zheng to give Freya to him. If he knew the young man's true identity, there was no doubt that he would faint again instantly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's cold expression softened, however, his mocking tone told them of his still apparent annoyance with what just happened. "I have long heard of the Sword Manor as a sacred place for independent warriors. I did not know it would be a place that was so hard to enter. The warriors don't rely on their insight or passion in swordsmanship, instead, they rely on the life vitality crystals in their pockets. I wonder what Supreme Lord Sword would think if he knew about this. When he comes back and sees what the Sword Manor has become, I'm afraid he will be very disappointed."</p>

  <p>His words echoed in the minds of the independent warriors present.</p>

  <p>They had trekked all this way because of their obsession with swordsmanship and their hopes to further hone their sword techniques in order to obtain a more powerful sword intent. However, once they arrived, they quickly discovered that they must spend their life vitality jades in order to gain entry to the Sword Manor. They felt extremely disappointed.</p>

  <p>Caiden Han's eyes lit up from Zheng's words. Instead of focusing on the fact that he just shaded the Sword Manor, he was more concerned with the implication of what the young man said: Supreme Lord Sword still hadn't died.</p>

  <p>As he thought about this, his expression grew even more sincere. "The mechanism of obtaining the nine-star sword token is indeed improper! I will report this to the senior leaders in order to make the necessary adjustments. Since you have come all this way, it may be best to come to the Sword Manor and have a chat!"</p>
