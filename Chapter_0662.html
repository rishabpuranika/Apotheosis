<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 662 A Second Genuine Dragon (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It took him three whole days to cross the fourth circle and finally enter the fifth circle. He needed to enter the sixth circle for the cyan dragon to put his plan in action.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also understood clearly that even for the cyan dragon, it was a difficult task to swallow the Owl Beast's evil spirit, since the dragon, too, was currently weak, even though he talked as if this was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>Still, the result they would get post fighting the evil spirit surpassed the efforts they needed to put in.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng cultivated himself day and night, Zack Zhao decided to send out a message to someone. He went to the transmission platform in the huge city and put a jade pendant into it, which carried his message.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon World was a world different from the one where Luo Luo Zheng had stayed. Its magnanimity was beyond everyone's imagination!</p>

  <p>Even the Dragon Lineage Human area was only one out of its ten thousand parts. The message jade pendant needed to fly about 300 billion trillion miles before arriving at the Dragon Blaze Hall which was where Zack came from. Sending this message cost him a lot. If it wasn't for Luo Luo Zheng, he would never have done it.</p>

  <p>Recently, Zack had been going through numerous books to understand the things around him more deeply. He found that the last time the baptism by laws had occurred was eight thousand and four hundred years ago to a person with the family name of Meng, who was now the head of the Green Dragon Palace.</p>

  <p>And now, it had occurred to no one else but this young boy from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>It did not mean Luo Luo Zheng could become the head of some dragon palace after the baptism. A warrior only grew into someone with power under the influence of factors like luck, cultivation, epiphany and fate...</p>

  <p>Yet, the baptism had at least guaranteed the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had the opportunity.</p>

  <p>Dragon Blaze Hall would never want to miss out on the chance of enrolling such a talent.</p>

  <p>What Zack did not know was that merely six hours before him, Elder Wei had also sent a similar message. His message was already flying to the Dragon Abyss Palace, which was 250 billion trillion miles away.</p>

  <p>Elder Wei had the advantage of old age. He was a highly experienced and thoughtful individual. He also knew Zack wasn't someone who gave up easily, so he took his actions first and invited the person of a high position in the Dragon Abyss Palace to handle this matter. Because he had sent them the message, they wouldn't blame Wei even if they somehow didn't succeed in attracting Luo Luo Zheng to join them. If the official from the Dragon Abyss Palace lost to the Dragon Blaze Hall, Elder Wei would still be spared of the blame.</p>

  <p>While both Wei and Zack waited for the effect of their reinforcements, Luo Luo Zheng inched closer and closer to the Owl Beast evil spirit.</p>

  <p>If one had to understand how difficult it was to break through the Fighting Soul Level, they could look at the Dragon Lineage humans who had flown to the Genuine Dragon World. Most of them were still in the first circle and a small part of them in the second circle. Barely any had entered the third one.</p>

  <p>The fourth circle was completely devoid of warriors and then there was Luo Luo Zheng, fighting all alone in the fifth!</p>

  <p>Quack!</p>

  <p>The Owl Beast at the center of the black ball felt something unusual, as if it was being approached by a very powerful soul. Only, it was hidden inside Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng stepped into the fifth circle, it started to give out loud howls.</p>

  <p>But the Soul-nurturing Thunder lock had restrained it tightly and it had no other way to fight against Luo Luo Zheng except to exert a great pull and give off his soul power pressure.</p>

  <p>No other warriors in the black ball could face the spirit. Some of them couldn't even walk in a straight line at times when the Owl Beast radiated its soul power.</p>

  <p>Crackle!</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng stepped out of the little oil lamp's glow, his soul cracked a bit due to the constant soul power pressure. But his soul had become very powerful due to practicing for days on end. This crack was merely on the surface level. Before, his soul could've been pierced by another's soul power pressure easily, but not now.</p>

  <p>The fifth circle took the longest time to be crossed. It took Luo Luo Zheng thirteen days to adapt himself to the high soul power pressure. After its constant subjection, his soul had grown to be stronger than ever. At this point, even if Christopher inflicted a cut on his soul, it wouldn't make a difference.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng prepared himself standing at the edge of the fifth circle, and asked the cyan dragon,"Are you ready? I can step into the sixth circle if you are."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon answered in all earnestness,"Yes, I am. Be cautious when you enter. When I break the Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock, it will lead to a higher soul pressure."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was merely a soul without a body now so he could take a deep breath to relax himself. He stood with back arched down, squinting his eyes and carefully looking at the humongous Owl Beast evil spirit. He counted to three in his mind and rushed into the sixth circle.</p>

  <p>The other warriors were merely onlookers now, thinking Luo Luo Zheng was determined to break through the Fighting Soul Level. They had no way of knowing he had just charged at the Owl Beast evil spirit itself!</p>

  <p>Precisely at that moment, the huge transmission array located at the center of the city lit up. A man in a fur coat appeared out of it, with a flame burning in his pupils. Stepping out of the array, he looked all around him with a calm expression. He was no one but the second leader of the Dragon Blaze Hall!</p>

  <p>Zack got alerted immediately. He had been anxiously waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Presently, he walked over to him and greeted him excitedly. "Mr. Nian!</p>

  <p>How nice to see you here! I have been waiting for you here for too long!"</p>
