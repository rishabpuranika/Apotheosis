<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea how this boy was projecting his soul into this small city with a population of only a few hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>When he thought of the strange scene that occurred in this city and the Spirit Container that the boy had mentioned, Luo Zheng guessed that he must have controlled the souls of these people.</p>

  <p>Not only was this method unimaginable, it was also extremely cruel.</p>

  <p>There had been wars among the sects in the Central Region before. When a war broke out, it would involve millions of warriors and many lives were lost. However, not many mortals would be a part of it.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, it was easy to kill mortals as they had zero combat strength compared to warriors. On the other hand, killing so many mortals for no reason would bring far too much malicious Mu Ning. Thus, the gains were not worth it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, mortals were the foundation of the Central Region and countless talents were born from them. They were the cornerstone of the Central Region's development. The Sea God Continent had the Tower of Sin where warriors could cultivate, but the Central Region had no such place for cultivation. Therefore, warriors would normally not kill mortals.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Heavenly Evil Sect, it was possible that one or two sacred places might appear in the Central Region in another hundred years.</p>

  <p>And in another thousand years, there might be a seventh-grade sacred place and several warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>However, this time, the Heavenly Evil Sect had crossed the line. They didn't care about the consequences.</p>

  <p>Seeing the boy drilling into his mind, Luo Zheng did not resist at all. Instead, he allowed him to crawl into his mind.</p>

  <p>"Have you given up on resisting? The warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the Central Region are too weak. Not only are you weak physically, but your souls are fragile too!" sneered the boy. The other warriors who he had killed earlier had at least tried to resist, but Luo Zheng wasn't doing anything at all. This convinced him that Zheng's soul was weaker than those warriors'.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul floated in his mind, emitting an emerald green light. It had almost reached the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm, but the cyan dragon advised him to stop training his soul. Once the soul seed was ready, his soul would merge with it and he would be able to break through to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Making the soul seed seemed to be a very complicated task. Even with the cyan dragon's expertise, progress was incredibly slow.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng had stopped cultivating his soul, it was already much stronger than the other warriors'. He had never met another warrior, be it on the Sea God Continent or in the Central Region, who possessed a soul at the Fighting Soul Realm. Neither the warriors at the Life and Death Realm in the Central Region nor war sages on the Sea God Continent had a soul at the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>He reckoned that only the mightiest warriors at the Soul Sea Realm from the Purple Heart Sacred Place and the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place could possess the soul of the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>As for the strength of the boy in front of him, Luo Zheng had no idea, but he believed that he was probably also at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng found the boy in his mind.</p>

  <p>The sneer on the boy's face disappeared when he saw Luo Zheng. The sight of the green light radiating from Zheng's soul made his voice tremble. "Jasper Fighting Soul Realm?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "My soul is indeed weak, but your soul is much weaker, like an ant's!" he mocked.</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, the boy moved at the highest speed, in an attempt to fly out of Zheng's mind. Battles between souls usually happened in an instant.</p>

  <p>When the boy saw that Zheng's soul was already close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm, he didn't dare to hang around in his mind any longer.</p>

  <p>"Now that you've come, you won't be able to leave!" Luo Zheng said coldly.</p>

  <p>A majestic roar echoed in his mind.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>It was the roar of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked the panic-stricken boy.</p>

  <p>He was paralyzed with fear. He saw a giant dragon appearing in the depths of Zheng's mind and a ray of multicolored light was spewing out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>The light released a massive attraction force and the boy was unable to move anymore.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was floating in his mind. He didn't have any intentions of making a move. All he said to the boy was, "I forgot to tell you. Your opponent isn't me. It's him."</p>

  <p>With that, the boy got sucked into the huge multicolored light instantly.</p>

  <p>Even if it was a powerful Owl Beast, the cyan dragon would be able to swallow it, let alone the boy whose soul was only at the Fighting Soul Realm. How could he be a match for the cyan dragon?</p>

  <p>After gobbling up the boy's soul, the cyan dragon said to Luo Zheng, "His soul is very complex. It must have been formed from the souls of countless people together. His own soul has only one strand within it."</p>

  <p>"One strand? That means the other souls belong to the hundreds of thousands of mortals in Melody City," Luo Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"That's right. He seems to be using some method of extracting people's souls. He extracted a strand of every person's soul and put them together by using his own soul," said the cyan dragon slowly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head as he opened his eyes, and slowly headed in the direction of Tianming and the rest of the people.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what happened? I think I saw a soul drilling into your mind." Tianming had sharp eyes. There was a hint of worry on his face. A soul battle was extremely dangerous. He didn't know whether Luo Zheng could handle it properly.</p>

  <p>"I've already killed him," Luo Zheng replied triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Right then the mortals in the city opened their eyes. However, most of them were covering their heads. They felt dispirited, and some of them even fainted and fell onto the ground.</p>

  <p>A strand of their souls had been extracted and used by the boy, who was then devoured by the cyan dragon. Their souls had suffered damage as well.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they would feel the pain.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng had arrived. If this continued for a long time, the boy would slowly drain the souls of all these mortals. And if that happened, all of them might just turn into zombies.</p>

  <p>At the same time, 10, 000 miles away from Melody City, something was happening in the place where the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been located.</p>

  <p>After the Heavenly Evil Sect wiped out the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the place was designated as its temporary headquarters.</p>

  <p>There was a large altar in the center of the grand hall, and in the center of the altar was a small Eight-diagram Mirror. Suddenly, a crack appeared in the mirror.</p>

  <p>This was followed by a blood-curdling scream. It seemed to be coming from within the mirror.</p>

  <p>The face that appeared in the mirror was that of the boy.</p>

  <p>"Master Wallace! What's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"Master Wallace! Wait a moment. I'll go get the Lord!"</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the hall left in a hurry.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace was behaving very strangely. Even if he was just projecting a soul in the mirror, the warriors were scared of being around him. They tried to escape under the pretense of looking for Eddie.</p>

  <p>Eddie appeared in the hall shortly.</p>

  <p>He had a strange expression when he saw the crack in the mirror. He cupped his hands and asked the boy in the mirror, "Master Wallace, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Humph! The strand of my soul that was projected in Melody City was devoured by someone," Master Wallace said abrasively.</p>

  <p>Eddie was surprised. He immediately asked, "Although it was just a projection of your soul, it still possessed the strength of the Fighting Soul Realm. Who in the Central Region could have the power to devour your soul?"</p>

  <p>"This person's soul is incomparably powerful. And I've also discovered a big secret!" said the boy with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Really? What secret did you find?" Eddie was eager to know.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to know. When the Star Storm ends, I will personally come to the Sky Northern Region. Leave that young man to me!" The boy smiled wickedly. His face gradually faded.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace's message made Eddie gloomy. It was not like he couldn't guess who Master Wallace was referring to. There was only one person in the young generation of the Central Region whose soul was so strong— Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>But he couldn't solve the mystery of the secret that Master Wallace spoke of.</p>
