  <p>
</p>

  <p>Four days had passed since the Taiyi Heaven Palace stabilized, and Luo Zheng finally got into his inner world.</p>

  <p>The moment he transformed into his incarnation, he spotted a huge round leaf that hovered in the sky. This leaf floated and rotated in midair, and glowed with a light green hue.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened at the sight of the leaf. With a flash, he came to the side of the leaf.</p>

  <p>Right above the leaf were human beings who happened to be busy. They were carving strange arrays across the leaf.</p>

  <p>Apparently, they were from the human race's Civilization Artifact, and they belonged to the human race of the 77th chaos.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng created a separate continent for them, they never stopped building in his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, but what is this leaf?" Luo Zheng asked into the air, hoping one of them to answer.</p>

  <p>One of them looked up as he recognized Luo Zheng's voice. After all, he was their ruler.</p>

  <p>However, though Luo Zheng was their ruler, they were a cocky race. Because they were not born and raised in Luo Zheng's inner world, they did not revere him with respect and authority.</p>

  <p>"It's the Divine Aura Leaf," one of them responded, without even looking up.</p>

  <p>"And what is its use?" Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>"It has the ability to speed up cultivations of all the creatures in the world," the same man responded.</p>

  <p>After hearing this, Luo Zheng paced around to get a better look at the leaf. He didn't realize that the Primeval Lord of Heaven would have these people cultivate such a useful feat in his inner world!</p>

  <p>He walked towards the edge of the leaf and small balls were floating a few feet away. "What are those?"</p>

  <p>"They are Transformation Balls," the man replied, and without hesitation, he continued to explain, "Any True God can enter the Transformation Ball to cultivate, strengthen their souls, and make necessary preparations to enter the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>"And what are those storms in the distance?" Luo Zheng asked, pointing towards the dense grey clouds.</p>

  <p>Looking around, Luo Zheng did not expect the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the rest to build so many things while he was gone.</p>

  <p>Because he was gone for so long, Luo Zheng didn't know that the Primeval Lord of Heaven gathered the vast majority of the elites in the 77th chaos. Back then, they had created the most suitable cultivation methods and the most convenient methods, too.</p>

  <p>After the Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed Luo Zheng's inner world was indeed a primitive land, he put a lot of hard work into making it what it was now.</p>

  <p>Aside from using the inner world as land, he also explored Luo Zheng's inner world in detail, including the forbidden lands and the composition of the races. Afterwards, he asked Fuxi and the rest to come up with a plan that would change the inner world completely.</p>

  <p>No matter what, Luo Zheng believed in these humans and their potential. It was no surprise that he'd gifted the Primeval Lord of Heaven with full disposal of his inner world.</p>

  <p>He was just surprised to see that it had been rebuilt and improved in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>In fact, not only did the Primeval Lord of Heaven modify the world, he had also guided it singlehandedly.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng's world structure was simple. This was when the powerful warriors in the entire world were controlled by the Evil God, and soon after, Edna and her clan controlled them. At that time, they wanted to control the inner world and had no interest in strengthening the humans. This was what made them such brutal tyrants.</p>

  <p>However, after the Primeval Lord of Heaven took control of the world, he completely changed the dynamic.</p>

  <p>This birthed the ancient legends that told people about the divine gate that led to the heaven. When one reached the True God Realm, they could step into the divine gate and reach such paradise.</p>

  <p>In addition, they provoked the battles among several great forces, which sent the cultivation atmosphere to grow tense. Left and right, all sorts of creatures cultivated themselves to grow stronger. In the end, this was what the Primeval Lord of Heaven wanted to see.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng finally grasped all the new knowledge, wisps of golden light flashed in the distance, rocketing into the sky.</p>

  <p>"Then what is it?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"That... I'm not sure," the man replied, looking puzzled as ever.</p>

  <p>The flashing lights seemed odd, so Luo Zheng took it upon himself to find out.</p>

  <p>He teleported right to the place where the golden light was shining. There, he was shocked to be among a lot of large, golden pillars.</p>

  <p>In the center of the pillars stood the Primeval Lord of Heaven, looking up at them with a big, genuine smile across his face.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Five Orientations, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent and the Truth of Void Destruction..." Luo Zheng looked around as he noticed the words etched on each pillar.</p>

  <p>In total, there were 14 golden pillars, 13 of which had the Truths of Divine Dao recorded on them. However, one of the pillars was completely blank.</p>

  <p>"Why did you engrave the Truths of Divine Dao here?" Luo Zheng asked politely.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed. "This is for the cultivation of the creatures in the primitive land. You might have forgotten, but because this is the primitive land, people here can reach the Other Shore once they comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>Was it possible for the creatures in his inner world to be on the Other Shore with him? Luo Zheng had never thought about it.</p>

  <p>"This blank golden pillar..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spoke out, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven interrupted, "I plan to engrave the Truth of Three-Energy Construction on it." As he walked towards the blank pillar, he added, "However, as you said, King Manard only imparted the Truth of Three-Energy Construction to you. I won't ask you to engrave it just yet. We may discuss things when we see King Manard."</p>

  <p>"Then we can go now," Luo Zheng said enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>This was perfect, especially since Luo Zheng already agreed to visit King Manard along with the Primeval Lord of Heaven before. Because of the war in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, their meeting had been severely delayed.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes lit up. "That is good."</p>

  <p>He did not mean to be abrupt, but he had been waiting for this moment for a long time.</p>

  <p>After they shook hands, Luo Zheng dissipated his incarnation while the Primeval Lord of Heaven summoned people from the book.</p>

  <p>Right there and then, the energy souls of Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Emperor Di Jun, Zhurong, Gonggong and the others appeared beside the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Each of them had a personal interest in King Manard, but mostly, they wanted to meet King Manard who created the second Other Shore in the Land of Ashes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, after dispersing his incarnation, Luo Zheng reappeared in his room, sitting cross-legged. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and began to silently activate the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>After a few moments of silence, a mysterious Truth of Divine Dao surrounded him and he appeared in another space. It was not someplace unfamiliar, because this was the space Mount had exiled him to before.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and looked around. In the distance, the ruins connected, and eventually formed a long, thin "trash belt".</p>

  <p>Not long after, the Primeval Lord of Heaven led his group and they all appeared right above Luo Zheng's head. There were over 30 heads floating above him.</p>

  <p>Seeing so many heads, Luo Zheng couldn't help but be a little tense.</p>

  <p>However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others did not let petty worries bother them. Their eyes widened as they tried to familiarize themselves with the space.</p>

  <p>"Everything in the Land of Ashes should have been destroyed, but these things were preserved so well. This is incredible..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke out, admiring this special space.</p>

  <p>"What's more incredible is that King Manard has also transformed this world into an Other Shore," the Snake Goddess pointed out.</p>
