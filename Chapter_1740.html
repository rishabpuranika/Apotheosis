  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain was hollow.</p>

  <p>Right at the opening, Luo Luo Zheng stood as he looked down.</p>

  <p>A deep, red light shone from inside the structure, hindering his view.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's pupils, a jade-green light was shining. After his eyes had been cleansed by the sap from the divine tree, he could clearly see what was hidden over long distances away. But even after looking at it once more, he couldn't see it quite clearly.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had sensed a strange Mu Ning from within the cave since he entered, he didn't turn back.</p>

  <p>Without much thinking, he stepped into the opening and descended from the top of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>At this point, the man was bearing much pressure.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning coming from within the mountain was so thick that it seemed nearly solid. At a glance, it looked like some kind of red mist in strange shapes as if there were all sorts of demons and ghosts circling around Luo Luo Zheng. Strange cries came from them as well.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng tried to listen more carefully, the sounds faded away as if they were mere illusions.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he felt a black shadow pass over his head.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>Instantly, he turned alert. Although he was undoubtedly a bold, courageous man, he had just reached the Spirit Supreme Realm? he wasn't invincible.</p>

  <p>When he lifted his head to see what the black shadow was, he sent his senses outward to scan the area.</p>

  <p>But the rich malicious Mu Ning from the cave was affecting his perception.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he truly was hallucinating, immersed in the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere felt too dense. If he stayed there for too long, he feared there would be unpredictable consequences.</p>

  <p>With this thought, he decided to speed up. And soon, he landed on the ground. The Killing Sword Mountain was located in the belly of a mountain range and Luo Luo Zheng was right in its core. One could imagine the pressure he felt.</p>

  <p>Just as he reached the ground, he heard a panting sound.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng turned around, there was no one there. The area was still thick with a blood-red malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>With the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his grasp, he chose a direction and continued on forward. But after taking only two steps, he heard the panting once again.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The moment he heard it, Luo Luo Zheng turned right around and suddenly thrust his sword forward.</p>

  <p>Disturbed by the sword light, the malicious Mu Ning around him started churning like a demon.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the sword light shot out, it submerged into the endless malicious Mu Ning, hitting nothing.</p>

  <p>Skeptical, Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and continued walking forward with his sword in hand. Having already reached such a depth, he had no more reason to retreat. He could only become more vigilant and keep walking forward.</p>

  <p>But the doubt in his heart grew stronger.</p>

  <p>Could it be that this was part of the examination for the Emotion Closing Divine Dao?</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng pondered on it, it didn't seem right. If it was simply to hone his swordsmanship, there was no need for him to enter such a strange place. Supreme Lord Sword must have asked him to come here for some bigger reason.</p>

  <p>As he continued forward, Luo Luo Zheng spotted a tombstone standing stark naked on the side of the path. It seemed very out of place.</p>

  <p>Approaching it, Luo Luo Zheng examined the tombstone. There were no letters carved into it. Just who was resting underneath it?</p>

  <p>Sure that it had nothing to do with his journey, Luo Luo Zheng turned and walked onward. But soon after, he saw another tombstone just like it, bare, without words.</p>

  <p>Proceeding forward, he saw a third one.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Luo Zheng realized that something was wrong. Before passing by the tombstone, he tapped his finger lightly. Then, a thin wind blade hit the top of the tombstone, leaving a small mark.</p>

  <p>When the fourth tombstone appeared, Luo Luo Zheng checked the surface.</p>

  <p>"It's the same one," he murmured, spotting the mark he had made before.</p>

  <p>And then he was certain that he had been circling the tombstone all this time.</p>

  <p>Martial artists that cultivated in the Space Law were extremely sensitive to space. Normal people would get lost in the fog because of how difficult it was to determine their position.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng would not. He was well aware that he was walking in a straight line. There was absolutely no deviation.</p>

  <p>But even so, he kept returning to his starting point. Some kind of force was keeping him trapped in a loop.</p>

  <p>'What a clever method!' Luo Luo Zheng praised the trap inwardly as he stood in front of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>Once one cultivated the Space Law to a higher level, they were able to connect two spaces. And Luo Luo Zheng could do so as he traveled through space.</p>

  <p>But once space shifted, it emitted fluctuations of the Space Law right where the first space was connected to the second. This was something Luo Luo Zheng didn't sense here.</p>

  <p>Considering this, Luo Luo Zheng realized that the one who created this spatial maze array was definitely strong when it came to the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Because four tombstones came into Luo Zheng's sight, he knew that he had wandered the same area four times already.</p>

  <p>After a moment, Luo Luo Zheng kicked off the ground with his feet and sped away, keeping closely above the ground.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His speed was remarkable as he glided across the surface.</p>

  <p>The fifth tombstone...</p>

  <p>The sixth tombstone...</p>

  <p>Seeing a tombstone meant that Luo Luo Zheng had passed through a spatial node and was teleported back to where he started. Judging from his speed, he estimated that the spatial maze array was about eight thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>But knowing the scope of the area didn't make it any easier for Luo Luo Zheng to leave? not unless he cultivated the Space Law to an even higher level.</p>

  <p>"The malicious Mu Ning is becoming increasingly thick. Haven't you noticed?"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Xun's slender figure gradually condensed right before Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Her eyes flickered as she examined her surroundings. "This looks like a trap."</p>

  <p>"A trap?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, still stunned.</p>

  <p>Though he wasn't exactly surprised, he didn't see any reason why Supreme Lord Sword would deceive him from afar to such an extent.</p>

  <p>Staring at Luo Luo Zheng, Xun smiled coldly. She could tell what he was thinking. Pointing up, she said, "If you don't believe me, just look for yourself."</p>

  <p>Following her finger, Luo Luo Zheng looked up and was shocked to see a large, blood-red face staring at him with a pair of empty eyes. These eyes didn't have the slightest hint of life, and that expression wasn't something any human should be able to make.</p>

  <p>While he had seen vengeful spirits in the past, Luo Luo Zheng had never felt something as chilling.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng raised his hand and slashed the face with the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. No matter what the hell it was, he had to kill it first, he thought.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Luo Luo Zheng had lost his patience that he used the Gods-intimidating Strike right away.</p>

  <p>If this sword light pierced through it, it could probably split the Killing Sword Mountain apart. It might even be able to penetrate the mountain from outside.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had underestimated the spatial maze array, or rather, he had underestimated the Killing Sword Mountain itself.</p>

  <p>If it was so easy to destroy, who could the sacred place stop, relying on the bronze door? If that were the case, any warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm could easily force their way in. But the secrets of the Killing Sword Mountain were far beyond Luo Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>The sword light faded away as though it had sunken into an endless space, disappearing without a trace.</p>

  <p>The large, blood-red face was split into two by his sword, but it quickly merged back into one and slowly approached the ground.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that apart from the top of his head, there were faces that made people's hair stand on end appearing in every direction, approaching Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Give me the spear," Xun said.</p>

  <p>With a flick of Luo Zheng's finger, the Saint Killing Spear shot out from his space ring, falling into Xun's hand.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Shadowy Spin!'</p>

  <p>Xun's spear strike was sharper than Luo Zheng's sword strike, but it didn't seem to be of much use. From the attack, only a large hole was bore through the blood-red face. It didn't suffer any significant damage.</p>

  <p>"Use thunder," Xun instructed firmly.</p>

  <p>Then, a sliver arc as thick as a wrist shot out of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Thunder and lightning were evil's natural enemies. The lightning shot out suddenly and struck one of the huge faces. The massive face then began to sway. It looked pained under the constant swaying in the air as it emitted a terrifying roar.</p>
