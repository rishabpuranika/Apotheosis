<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain was hollow.</p>

  <p>Right at the opening, Zheng stood as he looked down.</p>

  <p>A deep, red light shone from inside the structure, hindering his view.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's pupils, a jade-green light was shining. After his eyes had been cleansed by the sap from the divine tree, he could clearly see what was hidden over long distances away. But even after looking at it once more, he couldn't see it quite clearly.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had sensed a strange aura from within the cave since he entered, he didn't turn back.</p>

  <p>Without much thinking, he stepped into the opening and descended from the top of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>At this point, the man was bearing much pressure.</p>

  <p>The malicious aura coming from within the mountain was so thick that it seemed nearly solid. At a glance, it looked like some kind of red mist in strange shapes as if there were all sorts of demons and ghosts circling around Zheng. Strange cries came from them as well.</p>

  <p>When Zheng tried to listen more carefully, the sounds faded away as if they were mere illusions.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he felt a black shadow pass over his head.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>Instantly, he turned alert. Although he was undoubtedly a bold, courageous man, he had just reached the Spirit Supreme Realm— he wasn't invincible.</p>

  <p>When he lifted his head to see what the black shadow was, he sent his senses outward to scan the area.</p>

  <p>But the rich malicious aura from the cave was affecting his perception.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he truly was hallucinating, immersed in the malicious aura.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere felt too dense. If he stayed there for too long, he feared there would be unpredictable consequences.</p>

  <p>With this thought, he decided to speed up. And soon, he landed on the ground. The Killing Sword Mountain was located in the belly of a mountain range and Zheng was right in its core. One could imagine the pressure he felt.</p>

  <p>Just as he reached the ground, he heard a panting sound.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>When Zheng turned around, there was no one there. The area was still thick with a blood-red malicious aura.</p>

  <p>With the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his grasp, he chose a direction and continued on forward. But after taking only two steps, he heard the panting once again.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The moment he heard it, Zheng turned right around and suddenly thrust his sword forward.</p>

  <p>Disturbed by the sword light, the malicious aura around him started churning like a demon.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the sword light shot out, it submerged into the endless malicious aura, hitting nothing.</p>

  <p>Skeptical, Zheng narrowed his eyes and continued walking forward with his sword in hand. Having already reached such a depth, he had no more reason to retreat. He could only become more vigilant and keep walking forward.</p>

  <p>But the doubt in his heart grew stronger.</p>

  <p>Could it be that this was part of the examination for the Emotion Closing Godly Way?</p>

  <p>When Zheng pondered on it, it didn't seem right. If it was simply to hone his swordsmanship, there was no need for him to enter such a strange place. Supreme Lord Sword must have asked him to come here for some bigger reason.</p>

  <p>As he continued forward, Zheng spotted a tombstone standing stark naked on the side of the path. It seemed very out of place.</p>

  <p>Approaching it, Zheng examined the tombstone. There were no letters carved into it. Just who was resting underneath it?</p>

  <p>Sure that it had nothing to do with his journey, Zheng turned and walked onward. But soon after, he saw another tombstone just like it, bare, without words.</p>

  <p>Proceeding forward, he saw a third one.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng realized that something was wrong. Before passing by the tombstone, he tapped his finger lightly. Then, a thin wind blade hit the top of the tombstone, leaving a small mark.</p>

  <p>When the fourth tombstone appeared, Zheng checked the surface.</p>

  <p>"It's the same one," he murmured, spotting the mark he had made before.</p>

  <p>And then he was certain that he had been circling the tombstone all this time.</p>

  <p>Martial artists that cultivated in the Space Law were extremely sensitive to space. Normal people would get lost in the fog because of how difficult it was to determine their position.</p>

  <p>But Zheng would not. He was well aware that he was walking in a straight line. There was absolutely no deviation.</p>

  <p>But even so, he kept returning to his starting point. Some kind of force was keeping him trapped in a loop.</p>

  <p>'What a clever method!' Zheng praised the trap inwardly as he stood in front of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>Once one cultivated the Space Law to a higher level, they were able to connect two spaces. And Zheng could do so as he traveled through space.</p>

  <p>But once space shifted, it emitted fluctuations of the Space Law right where the first space was connected to the second. This was something Zheng didn't sense here.</p>

  <p>Considering this, Zheng realized that the one who created this spatial maze array was definitely strong when it came to the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Because four tombstones came into Zheng's sight, he knew that he had wandered the same area four times already.</p>

  <p>After a moment, Zheng kicked off the ground with his feet and sped away, keeping closely above the ground.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His speed was remarkable as he glided across the surface.</p>

  <p>The fifth tombstone...</p>

  <p>The sixth tombstone...</p>

  <p>Seeing a tombstone meant that Zheng had passed through a spatial node and was teleported back to where he started. Judging from his speed, he estimated that the spatial maze array was about eight thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>But knowing the scope of the area didn't make it any easier for Zheng to leave— not unless he cultivated the Space Law to an even higher level.</p>

  <p>"The malicious aura is becoming increasingly thick. Haven't you noticed?"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Xun's slender figure gradually condensed right before Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Her eyes flickered as she examined her surroundings. "This looks like a trap."</p>

  <p>"A trap?" Zheng asked, still stunned.</p>

  <p>Though he wasn't exactly surprised, he didn't see any reason why Supreme Lord Sword would deceive him from afar to such an extent.</p>

  <p>Staring at Zheng, Xun smiled coldly. She could tell what he was thinking. Pointing up, she said, "If you don't believe me, just look for yourself."</p>

  <p>Following her finger, Zheng looked up and was shocked to see a large, blood-red face staring at him with a pair of empty eyes. These eyes didn't have the slightest hint of life, and that expression wasn't something any human should be able to make.</p>

  <p>While he had seen vengeful spirits in the past, Zheng had never felt something as chilling.</p>

  <p>So Zheng raised his hand and slashed the face with the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. No matter what the hell it was, he had to kill it first, he thought.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Zheng had lost his patience that he used the Gods-intimidating Strike right away.</p>

  <p>If this sword light pierced through it, it could probably split the Killing Sword Mountain apart. It might even be able to penetrate the mountain from outside.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had underestimated the spatial maze array, or rather, he had underestimated the Killing Sword Mountain itself.</p>

  <p>If it was so easy to destroy, who could the sacred place stop, relying on the bronze door? If that were the case, any warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm could easily force their way in. But the secrets of the Killing Sword Mountain were far beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>The sword light faded away as though it had sunken into an endless space, disappearing without a trace.</p>

  <p>The large, blood-red face was split into two by his sword, but it quickly merged back into one and slowly approached the ground.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng discovered that apart from the top of his head, there were faces that made people's hair stand on end appearing in every direction, approaching Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Give me the spear," Xun said.</p>

  <p>With a flick of Zheng's finger, the Saint Killing Spear shot out from his space ring, falling into Xun's hand.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Shadowy Spin!'</p>

  <p>Xun's spear strike was sharper than Zheng's sword strike, but it didn't seem to be of much use. From the attack, only a large hole was bore through the blood-red face. It didn't suffer any significant damage.</p>

  <p>"Use thunder," Xun instructed firmly.</p>

  <p>Then, a sliver arc as thick as a wrist shot out of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Thunder and lightning were evil's natural enemies. The lightning shot out suddenly and struck one of the huge faces. The massive face then began to sway. It looked pained under the constant swaying in the air as it emitted a terrifying roar.</p>
