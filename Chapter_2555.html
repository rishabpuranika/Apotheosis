  <p>
</p>

  <p>After leaving the Immemorial Wilderness, Zheng and the others returned to the stronghold.</p>

  <p>According to the ordinances, these Wild Gods were obliged to have all of the wild bones they had found checked while the Nine Li race would take half of the wild bones. Only then were they permitted to leave.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race possessed a secret method to detect the amount of wild bones dug out by the Wild Gods. Even if they were to hide them in their space rings, they could not leave without the wild bones being detected.</p>

  <p>Every Wild God was required to hand over all of the wild bones they had obtained to the Nine Li race for inspection.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng and the two other Wild Gods with him didn't need to hand over half of their wild bones to the Nine Li race, yet they still needed to go through the inspection procedure.</p>

  <p>"Master Romeo has informed us that you are to keep all your wild bones, and you are welcome to exchange the blood wild bones you have obtained for ordinary wild bones at market price here," the woman in emerald clothes said and smiled sweetly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because of Romeo's instructions that she was very polite and treated Zheng with respect.</p>

  <p>It was common practice here to exchange the blood wild bones for common wild bones at the market price. After all, the Wild Gods here didn't have any special blood lineage, therefore it was useless for them to keep any blood wild bones that they had found. Although it might not present the best deals to trade the blood wild bones at market price, it was convenient. Most of the Wild Gods chose to use this option.</p>

  <p>Sarah and Hiram didn't have any quarrel with this arrangement, and they handed over the blood wild bones they had found. Then someone came in and took the blood wild bones away. The Nine Li race would give them a correspondent number of common wild bones after they had evaluated the blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>"Exchange the blood wild bones at market price?" Zheng frowned slightly as a suspicion formed in his mind.</p>

  <p>The woman in emerald noticed Zheng's apprehensiveness and said with a smile, "Yes, you won't lose out on the price."</p>

  <p>"That is not the problem. One type of the blood wild bones I have dug out has proven very useful to me. I'm afraid I can't exchange those," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The girl in emerald was now caught in a dilemma. Although Romeo had ordered special treatment be given to Zheng, the rule was resolute. All kinds of blood wild bones the Wild Gods had gathered had to be handed over to the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>After all, most of the major races suffered a severe shortage of blood wild bones of their own bloodlines. Only in trading the blood wild bones with each other could they gain access to the blood wild bones they needed.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't look like he could have any special bloodline in his body. The girl wondered what he wanted the blood wild bones for in the first place.</p>

  <p>The girl in emerald considered this and said, "Can I see the blood wild bones you have dug out?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and duly removed the collection of blood wild bones from his space ring.</p>

  <p>"So many?"</p>

  <p>The woman in emerald was aghast when she saw the impressive collection of blood wild bones now stacked on the table.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sarah, Hiram, and the servants around were all stunned at the sight of so many bones piled up on the table.</p>

  <p>On the polished table top, there were an impressive variety of blood wild bones, and each emitted all kinds of light from cyan to brown, blood red and green�</p>

  <p>There were over 80 blood wild bones in the collection! It was unheard of!</p>

  <p>For ordinary Wild Gods entering the Immemorial Wilderness, the number of wild bones they could dig out in one visit ranged from 30, 000 to 60, 000. However, this part of Immemorial Wilderness was much more challenging than other parts of the Immemorial Wilderness. It required warriors to take greater risks, and the warriors would usually not dare to go into the highly dangerous core areas.</p>

  <p>In considering blood wild bones, generally speaking, it was already quite a feat if a warrior could obtain four or five of them in one collection trip.</p>

  <p>However, even if a warrior was extremely lucky, they would never collect more than 10 pieces. But Zheng had actually gathered near a hundred blood wild bones! That was an incredible feat and quite incomprehensible to every one present in the hall.</p>

  <p>Even though Sarah and Hiram, who had been digging the wild bones together with Zheng knew that Zheng had an acute affinity to the wild bones, they hadn't expected that he could have dug out so many blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>"Which kind of blood wild bones do you need to keep?" the girl in emerald asked in a subdued tone while staring at the blood wild bones lying on the table.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out his hand and selected four pieces of brown wild bones from the collection. "I just need these four blood wild bones, then you can exchange the rest of them for ordinary wild bones."</p>

  <p>Seeing the four blood wild bones Zheng had chosen, the girl in emerald arched her beautiful eyebrows and said, "You can't take the wild bones with Chiyou's bloodline."</p>

  <p>For the blood wild bones that contained the bloodline of other races, the Nine Li race only kept them for the purpose of trading with other races to obtain bones that contained Chiyou's bloodline. If Zheng had really needed some blood wild bones containing bloodline of other races the girl might have made an exception for Zheng and let him keep them. However, the blood wild bones with Chiyou's bloodline were treasures that they were determined to own.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. His biggest goal was to find the blood wild bones with Chiyou's bloodline, so how could he let anyone take them away now that he had?</p>

  <p>"Zheng, it's useless for you to claim these blood wild bones. Surely, you can't absorb the Wild God Power in them, can you?" Hiram, who stood beside Zheng, couldn't help asking.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's completely useless for you to possess these blood wild bones, however, they are of vital importance to our race," the girl agreed.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly asked, "What if I can, in fact, absorb the Wild God Power in them?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, those gathered in the hall were stunned.</p>

  <p>Some of them were completely overwhelmed by this statement, and they didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>Only those of the Nine Li race were able to absorb the power contained in the brown blood wild bones. This was a common knowledge. It was preposterous for Zheng to even suggest that he had this ability.</p>

  <p>The girl in emerald smiled condescendingly and was about to speak when a voice suddenly sounded from the other side of the hall.</p>

  <p>"If you can absorb the Wild God Power of those blood wild bones, the Nine Li race will reward you with another 50 pieces of blood wild bones," a silver haired middle-aged man walked forward and spoke into the silence.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was quite dignified with his silver hair, and he was of medium height. His luminous eyes shone with sharp light, and no one dared to look him in the eye. What was even stranger was that the Wild God Power he emitted was an indistinct and elusive aura. It was as if his Wild God Power had transcended to another level!</p>

  <p>Since coming to this world, Zheng had met a lot of Wild Gods. Although their bodies were impressively strong, Zheng had always felt confident that he could kill them with all his strength.</p>

  <p>But the middle-aged man with silver hair was something new. He gave Zheng an unfathomable feeling of the unknown.</p>

  <p>When the lady in emerald saw the middle-aged man with silver hair, she was both shocked and awed. She made obeisance and greeted, "Sir, what an honor to see you here! Please forgive me for not personally welcoming you."</p>

  <p>Giacomo waved his hand, and his eyes were also staring at Zheng. He carefully sized Zheng up from head to toe and said with a smile, "A man of wilderness has actually achieved status as a top-rank True God. I wonder what experiences you have faced to bring you to this achievement."</p>

  <p>Those living in the bone towers would never refer to the Wild Gods outside the bone towers as "pariahs". After all, that would be too disrespectful, so he only called Zheng "a man of wilderness".</p>

  <p>Zheng cupped his hands and asked, "Are you serious about the challenge that you laid down just now, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Of course! But there is no need to try, for it is futile. You can't do it. Ha-ha-ha." Giacomo laughed heartily. "But you saved my nephew, Romeo, and he said you are extremely powerful. Now we of the Nine Li race are badly in need of talent. It's not difficult for us to give you one set of blood of our Nine Li race. Do you want to take it?"</p>

  <p>Giacomo had come here specially for Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race had made a bet to determine ownership of the Sky South Bone Tower and this part of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>However, while making the bet, the Yellow Emperor race had killed Chandler and Farhann of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>These two men had both been powerful warriors of the younger generation of the Nine Li race. With the Nine Li race's loss of them, they would most probably now lose the bet.</p>

  <p>Nine Li race was consumed with fury, but their opponent hadn't broken any rules. So the Nine Li race had no avenue to voice their complaints.</p>

  <p>They could only blame themselves for not having been better prepared to prevent being tricked by their opponent.</p>

  <p>After Romeo's return to the bone tower, he had recommended Zheng to Giacomo. Without any hesitation, the latter had immediately rushed to the stronghold, hoping to find out whether Zheng was as magically strong as Romeo had described.</p>

  <p>Hearing Giacomo's offer, everyone present became tense, and greed burned in their eyes.</p>

  <p>The face of the woman in emerald also became tinged with envy. Born into a large sect in the bone tower, she had an extraordinary background, but even she was not qualified to be gifted with a set of Chiyou's blood!</p>
