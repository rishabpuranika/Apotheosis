<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just before the end of this thousand years came, all the forces in this world could hardly sit still.</p>

  <p>The Northern Leaning Bone Tower was built on the ninth rib of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Unlike other bone towers which rose vertically to the sky, the Northern Leaning Bone Tower was tilted towards the north by 60 degrees.</p>

  <p>It was comparatively intact and there wasn't much space for people to hide in it.</p>

  <p>However, in such a small and narrow bone tower, four races with bloodlines gathered together. One could imagine that the available space for these races to develop was very narrow.</p>

  <p>The exiles of these races weren't powerful enough to compete against the top races so they had trouble obtaining new bone towers.</p>

  <p>More than ten thousand years ago, the four races in the Northern Leaning Bone Tower attempted to enter the Sky South Bone Tower. They hoped that by means of a fair deal, the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race would be kind enough to give them a portion of the space in the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>However, all of their propositions were immediately rejected by the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>As the number of disciples they had in their races increased, the interior of the Northern Leaning Bone Tower became more and more crowded.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, the disciples from the four races had to live outside the bone tower. Only when the Light of Adjudication arrived would they enter the bone tower to hide temporarily. This only occurred once every thousand years.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, the disciples of the four races always returned one after the other and it made the Northern Leaning Bone Tower even more crowded.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the Northern Leaning Bone Tower, on a scarlet golden pillar, the patterns of a wolf, a lion, a crane, and an ape were carved.</p>

  <p>They were sigils of the four great races, namely the Spirit Wolf God race, the Heavenly Lion race, the Hiding Crane race, and the Silent Ape race.</p>

  <p>Beneath the golden pillar was an exile dressed in gray that walked around the area. He asked in a very flat tone, "Everyone, do you know what happened in the past days?"</p>

  <p>Beside him stood eight exiles who were the mainstay of the four races.</p>

  <p>They were being left behind in terms of strength among the exiles and could not compete against the exiles from the top races, but they were much stronger than the top Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>"Word has reached me that the Snake Goddess race is doing something unusual. They've decided to join forces with the Nine Li race, the Mysterious Oni race, and the Star Deer race. I am worried about what they're planning to do," an exile with red hair replied.</p>

  <p>"These races aren't normally in good terms with one another. Why are they suddenly working together?" another exile asked.</p>

  <p>"Except from trying to get out of this world, what else could be worthy of their attention?"</p>

  <p>The exile dressed in gray nodded and sighed, "Right. It has been said that they have found a way to escape from this world. Unfortunately, they have no plans of taking us with them."</p>

  <p>"Is there really a way to get out of this prison? They must be out of their minds!" the exile with red hair said with resentment.</p>

  <p>Although they hadn't had any hostility with the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race, they were still furious about the news.</p>

  <p>After all, all of them were imprisoned in this world and would all grab the chance to leave if they ever came across one. Now, they felt like they had been abandoned after hearing about what the Snake Goddess race was doing.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are being too naive. We have tried and tried again, but we failed every single time. This time, their failure is probably inevitable as well," another exile echoed.</p>

  <p>The gray clothed exile said, "But it is said that they have found two traitors from the Warden race who are offering to help them."</p>

  <p>"Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"That is impossible!"</p>

  <p>"The people of the Warden race never really show themselves. Could this rumor be true?"</p>

  <p>The exiles were all caught off guard by what they just heard.</p>

  <p>They just couldn't believe any of it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they were a little disappointed. After all, they were willing to join them if they had asked but the Snake Goddess race completely disregarded them.</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe this time it's actually true," the gray clothed exile said as he sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race surely made a significant gesture this time, which meant they had no intentions of hiding anything. The actions of Master Emily could also be regarded as a declaration of war against the Warden race.</p>

  <p>"Are we really not being given a chance to join them?"</p>

  <p>"We can help if they would let us!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>While the exiles were busy discussing amongst themselves, a dark figure floated over the Northern Leaning Bone Tower and caught their attention.</p>

  <p>"I think it might be someone from the Warden race," one of the exiles said with a grim face.</p>

  <p>All the exiles weren't friendly towards such black figures.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, the Warden race started visiting the bone towers more frequently. They would appear at least twice a year.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, they came today.</p>

  <p>Generally, after the quick visit, the members of the Warden race would leave as soon as they could. They wouldn't say even a word or show their real faces.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Warden member floated towards the exiles and hovered right in front of them.</p>

  <p>All of the exiles raised their heads as their faces were revealed to be full of doubt. They didn't know what the dark figure wanted to do.</p>

  <p>Moments later, the dark figure began to speak and what he said touched the hearts of the exiles.</p>

  <p>"The exiles who are imprisoned here, do you want to gain a chance to leave this world?"</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the Pyramid Bone Tower where the Yellow Emperor race lived...</p>

  <p>A pyramid-like bone mountain had been formed due to the terrain. They had decided to name it the Pyramid Bone Tower because of this.</p>

  <p>At the top of the mountain sat a young man.</p>

  <p>Based on his appearance, he looked younger than thirty but there was a sense of vicissitudes in his slightly opened eyes.</p>

  <p>He was known to be the most powerful exile of the Yellow Emperor race, Spark Yan.</p>

  <p>A black figure floated right in front of him and asked him in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Do you want the chance to get out of this place?"</p>

  <p>Spark seemed calm but his heart was racing uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>He already made himself clear about what happened with the Nine Li race and the Snake Goddess race. His race had always been on bad terms with the Nine Li race in this world and in the Source World. Now that the Nine Li race had found a chance to escape from the prison, of course they wouldn't bother to include his race in their plans.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't about to give up. With his character, no matter how strong the Snake Goddess race was, he and his people wouldn't just stand by and watch. Either all the races would be able to escape or they would all be trapped here eternally.</p>

  <p>Little did he expect that someone from the Warden race would show up and communicate with him for the first time in years.</p>

  <p>"A chance to leave this place..." Spark silently stared at the black figure floating in front of him as if he was trying to see through it. He then said,</p>

  <p>"Of course I do. But what is the price?"</p>
