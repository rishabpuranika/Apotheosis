<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3647 One-on-one Battle </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The purple long swords that came down from the sky suddenly charged straight towards the six arrays. The sudden sword attacks greatly shocked the mountain leaders.</p>

  <p>"What is the Vastness Mountain doing?"</p>

  <p>"Gethin is really rebelling!"</p>

  <p>"True, but he was really good at hiding from us!"</p>

  <p>The seven mountains had been accumulating their strength to try to fight against the Jin Wu in the Six-flame Array, but the Vastness Array just used their accumulated strength on their peers!</p>

  <p>"Don't be distracted. I'll do it!" Auden shouted.</p>

  <p>Then, he flew upwards as the Lofty Sword beneath him glowed a bright golden light.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Just then, the Lofty Sword's blade flipped and flew straight into the sky.</p>

  <p>Although Gethin was powerful and so was the Vastness Array, his attack ended up being divided into six parts. If Auden used all his strength, he might be able to take the impact.</p>

  <p>The Golden Mountain and the Ivory Mountain could also resist the attack, but they would have to be distracted because of this attack.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a strong spatial fluctuation burst out from the Six-flame Array when it exploded. In turn, the people inside the array all used the Grand Teleportation technique and quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>As a result, the blue flames from the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu and the fierce skills the other mountains released had all missed their targets!</p>

  <p>The Cage of Heaven and Earth had been set since the beginning of the battle in the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>However, people like Phoenix, Athemar, and Pearce were still able to break free from the Cage of Heaven and Earth.</p>

  <p>As the battle continued to advance south, however, the range of the Cage of Heaven and Earth became smaller and smaller.</p>

  <p>It was known that the smaller the area the cage covered, the stronger its power would be.</p>

  <p>That was why if the entire cage shrunk to a radius of ten thousand miles, even a powerful being like Pearce wouldn't be able to use the Grand Teleportation technique there.</p>

  <p>Despite all those conditions, there were still some theurgies in the Jin Wu that could resist the Cage of Heaven and Earth!</p>

  <p>Such a case was also Springer's second conspiracy.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>At that point, Springer and another eight people appeared in the Ivory Array.</p>

  <p>Their sudden appearance stunned all the powerful warriors in the Ivory Array.</p>

  <p>After all, they had been on their guard the moment they saw all the members of the Jin Wu disappear just now, and they did not expect that those members of the Jin Wu would be so bold to transfer themselves into the array via the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Springer glanced at the leader of the Ivory Mountain, who was close to him and said, "Break it!"</p>

  <p>Then, he flapped his black wings and flew towards the leader of the Ivory Mountain.</p>

  <p>In turn, the leader of the Ivory Mountain sneered and slashed at Springer's head with his blood-red sword, and a fierce battle between them ensued!</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu moved to different arrays in batches, which was also Springer's idea.</p>

  <p>Even though the Sky Net was torn open, the six arrays continued to guard against the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Taiyi Mountain had deployed the Thirteen Spiritual Swords Array, which possessed the mighty strength of the thirteen Lofty Swords.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Ivory Mountain deployed the Bloody Array.</p>

  <p>The Golden Mountain also had its own array.</p>

  <p>Now, over a hundred people including Springer and Phoenix could indeed use the Grand Teleportation to leave since the Sky Net was already broken.</p>

  <p>However, the Jin Wu's goal was not only to break the Sky Net, but also to completely capture this group of mountain leaders.</p>

  <p>It was highly necessary to break the several arrays the mountains were guarding. Of course, the Vastness Array was not included.</p>

  <p>As soon as Springer fought fiercely against the leader of the Ivory Mountain, the others began to tear the entire Ivory Array into pieces.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng saw the members of the Jin Wu instantly disappear when he drove the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu from his position in the Oneness Array. He thought that something unfortunate was about to happen.</p>

  <p>The next moment, a blue feather suddenly appeared in front of him. At the end of the feather was Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Phoenix was an executive in the Jin Wu, while Springer was the brains for them. When Springer had proposed a new plan, Phoenix agreed without hesitation.</p>

  <p>She hated Luo Zheng to the core so much that she couldn't allow to let him live for one more second.</p>

  <p>Of course, there were also other members of the Jin Wu who came along with her. Those other members dealt with the strong warriors like Pearce and Athemar.</p>

  <p>"It's not up to you now," Phoenix said with a ferocious smile. Her snow-white and delicate face looked somewhat charming despite her evilness and ferocity.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment she was done speaking, her wings flapped furiously and she flew towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When she was near him, her wings grasped Luo Zheng just like a big pair of hands.</p>

  <p>Then, she simultaneously pierced him with her flaming spear!</p>

  <p>No matter what tricks Luo Zheng used, he had no chance of winning against someone stronger than him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he couldn't teleport like last time because he was under the shackles of the Cage of Heaven and Earth.</p>

  <p>The sight of Luo Zheng, who had toiled her plans repeatedly, but was now about to die greatly pleased Phoenix. She sighed contentedly as if she had finally killed a powerful opponent.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he simply patted her wings and leaned forward. When he saw that the spear was about to touch his body, he took a deep breath and rolled over in an attempt to avoid the spear's tip.</p>

  <p>However, Phoenix was quicker to react than he was. Even if he endlessly rolled left and right, her delicate but deadly spear always followed him like a shadow, as if his defenses didn't affect it at all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The flaming spear let out a whistling sound, then it was directly pointed at his chest.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>In a split second, he had become a flaming man.</p>

  <p>Because he had never been harmed due to fire many times, Phoenix didn't expect that he would burn to ashes.</p>

  <p>But her spear strike contained fifteen thousand divine megatons of force this time!</p>

  <p>She had personally witnessed him enter the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it had been only a few months since he had left the Chaotic Source World. She was sure that he was still at the early stage of the Chaotic Source Realm!</p>

  <p>Not to mention that fifteen thousand divine megatons of force, even half of it might be enough to exhaust his Chaotic Source Spirits and disintegrate his body into pieces.</p>

  <p>But this was Luo Zheng, and with him, something unexpected happened a lot.</p>

  <p>Cling!</p>

  <p>Finally, Phoenix's spear stabbed into Luo Zheng's body, but it only made a crisp sound.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body withstood the spear.</p>

  <p>Then they began to weaken, but his mysterious Truth of Godly Way rapidly fluctuated and pooled within each Chaotic Source Spirit, thus quickly restoring their strength!</p>

  <p>"How?" Phoenix exclaimed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>She couldn't believe what she saw, and Luo Zheng even had the guts to smile at her.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she released all the power within her body. Her flaming spear released a terrible force of twenty-five thousand divine megatons, which was close to her limit.</p>

  <p>She didn't know how Luo Zheng had blocked her first spear, nor did she want to figure it out. She paid it no mind and proceeded to release more force!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The immensely strong force pushed the flaming spear even more, then it let out a sharp whistling sound and went straight towards Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Even in the face of such a powerful spear strike, Luo Zheng just faintly smiled.</p>

  <p>Could he still withstand this spear's attack?</p>

  <p>Just as Phoenix thought about it, she felt a burning aura around her. The aura did not come from her flaming spear, but from the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu that were flying everywhere.</p>
