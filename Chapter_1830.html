<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1830 The Temptation (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>When these vicious beasts roamed this world, they were rightfully considered the overlords of the region. They ruled everything and were at the very top of the food chain. A few of them, even if only a handful, could actually take on human form. Their power was truly undeniable.</p>

  <p>The warriors in this place though, despite the overruling strength of the vicious beasts, were even more powerful than they were. Here, they were reduced into food for the Collapsing Mountain members.</p>

  <p>A bloody horror show had begun in the center of the space— an area no more than ten thousand feet wide. Together, the members of the Collapsing Mountain race formed an irregular shaped circle around the mass of dead bodies. A beastly demolition, one might say.</p>

  <p>Only certain members of the Collapsing Mountain race were deemed with the responsibility for dismantling the beasts and they effected their work with great skill and precision. The beasts were picked apart one by one, the race members working like a team. It wasn't long before entire flaps of skin were being peeled back, a ripping sound resonating against the walls of the confined area. Blood soaked the ground, creating dark red almost black puddles at their feet. The beasts were dismembered, their flesh cut clean, their bones removed and their tendons torn.</p>

  <p>For an onlooker, the scene was extremely traumatic and sickening.</p>

  <p>Disgusting, even. However, these beasts were comparable to a world lord and every part of their bodies was extremely valuable, to say the least!</p>

  <p>With careful and quick work of their weapons, the Collapsing Mountain members dismembered the beasts in no time.</p>

  <p>Once all the beasts were taken apart, the working members took a step back. A strong stench of blood suddenly hit them. There was so much blood and the smell was so strong.</p>

  <p>With a quick glance around the space, it was clear that the martial artists and the children were used to the scene and the stench. The martial artist staying next to Zheng appeared to be feeling particularly uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>His breathing seemed labored and he clenched his chest with his hand, his facial expression distorted.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists were in a similar state: they gasped for air while lying on the ground with their eyes closed. Of course, from their angle, they couldn't see all of what was really going on. Zheng, on the other hand, had his back pressed up against the wall and from where he was sitting, he could observe the entire scene.</p>

  <p>Earlier, before the blood show, Zheng had discovered a multitude of grooves at the center of the square. At the time, he had thought that there was perhaps some form of giant magical array located there, but he understood better now. The Collapsing Mountain race didn't need to use any kind of magical array. Those grooves, also known as the blood grooves as he learned, were only used to divert the blood pouring from the vicious beasts they tore apart.</p>

  <p>The grooves were necessary due to the incredible amount of blood that could come from a single berserk beast. Once the fierce beasts were sliced open, the blood gushed like a river, and without the blood grooves to divert the flow, the tribe would probably flood in a sea of red. The beasts' blood essence was extremely vigorous. Zheng didn't know where the blood travelled to or where they accumulated it all. What he did know though, was that such a large amount of blood from such powerful berserk beasts would be unbelievably precious...</p>

  <p>Once the beast-slaughter was done and taken care of, it was time to celebrate! Enormous bonfires began to grow ablaze one after another, their orange-yellow flames filling the darkness with a warm glow.</p>

  <p>With celebrations like these, the members of the Collapsing Mountain race only used a special kind of wood. When they burned it, it gave off a unique fragrance. Their nostrils flared as they inhaled deeply, the smoke and fragrance burning the back of their throats. It felt like victory.</p>

  <p>Zheng might not have eaten in a few years, but the smell overwhelmed him with a sudden, shocking hunger. The wood's fragrance worked on his appetite, causing his stomach to grumble. Zheng thought that the smell would make anyone hungry, even a human.</p>

  <p>"Growl..."</p>

  <p>Did Zheng's stomach grumble so loudly that he heard it himself? A look of confusion washed over his face. He turned around and paid closer attention to those surrounding him. Suddenly, he could hear a series of grunts, grumbles and groans coming from all directions around him.</p>

  <p>Liusu was lying not too far off from Zheng. He watched her as she grabbed her gut, as if to stop it from rumbling. Even her stomach was growling out of hunger right now!</p>

  <p>Of course, every martial artist present had trained for far longer than Zheng had. Worse off than him in his opinion, they hadn't eaten anything in over 10, 000 years. The fragrant cyan-wood filled their lungs and forced them all into the hands of temptation.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here they go again..."</p>

  <p>"Every time night falls, it's the hardest time to endure! I'm getting sick and tired of it."</p>

  <p>"It just really makes me want to dig my teeth into a piece of meat so bad!"</p>

  <p>"Awooo..."</p>

  <p>A warrior could even be heard crying and wailing into the night. The hunger pains had become overwhelming. The martial artists felt as though they were on the brink of starvation.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming and delicious smell of burning wood was like a poison— one that made them all feel terribly hungry.</p>

  <p>It was true that when martial artists had gone through the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm, their willpower became much stronger than any ordinary person. Martial artists having crossed such realms could even endure the cruelest of tortures without shedding a single tear. Not all of them reached such extents, but those who did were bound to be the successors of certain extremely powerful forces or amazing talents. If the latter wasn't the case, the martial artist in question would have led a life of torment and pain.</p>

  <p>Currently though, and now more than ever, these martial artists had actually become incomparably weak. Temptation was breaking them.</p>

  <p>"This can't be possible..." Zheng was completely shocked by the warriors' reactions, his eyes darting from one martial artist to another.</p>

  <p>Liusu was lying on the ground, but upon hearing Zheng's words, she said, "That is the Calamity Dispelling Wood, and the fragrance it emits is the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance which can activate the most primitive and original appetite of all living beings. This kind of wood is a special product of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land."</p>

  <p>To the north of the Collapsing Mountain race, there was an immense, lush forest known as the Calamity Dispelling Forest. Most of the trees in the forest were tens of thousands of feet high. The forest covered several acres and the trees were so thick with foliage that one couldn't see the sky above them when walking through it.</p>

  <p>Here, the Calamity Dispelling Trees emitted the faint fragrance all the time. No need to burn their wood.</p>

  <p>In the Calamity Dispelling Forest, all living beings' desires were magnified countless times over. These creatures' instincts were also stimulated to their absolute limit.</p>

  <p>From small reptiles and ants to big birds, from low-level creatures to top of the food chain beasts, their sensations were amplified and their strongest desires were aroused. They crazily devoured one another and killed each other. At the same time, they copulated frantically and continued the cycle with their offspring.</p>

  <p>It was a hell on earth for those who lived here and coupled here and for the young that were raised here. On the other hand though, this frantic breeding ground was a living paradise for the growth of any vicious beast.</p>
