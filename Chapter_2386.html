<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being in the divine land, regardless of strength or horizon, Joy was at the top level. Not many things could shock her to such an extent.</p>

  <p>A look of curiosity appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he asked, "Truth of Divine Dao? What is it, exactly?"</p>

  <p>Joy didn't reply to Luo Zheng's question. Her gaze swept over the handwriting and the strange look in her eyes became more obvious. What was more, there was even a glimmer of excitement shining in her eyes.</p>

  <p>After a brief moment, she said, "Read the words, please."</p>

  <p>"What? Read them?" Luo Zheng asked, confused.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book beside them giggled aloud and said, "It's difficult to read such words. The young master can't read them, so I'm afraid that it's even less likely for the master to..."</p>

  <p>Despite hearing the words with his own ears, Luo Zheng was unconvinced.</p>

  <p>Was Immortal Book trying to say that, in his heart, Luo Nian had surpassed his father?</p>

  <p>"Then I'll give it a try!" Luo Zheng interrupted.</p>

  <p>He looked at the white papers, which were lined up in a row, and scanned the words with his eyes.</p>

  <p>These words were what Luo Nian had previously deciphered from the golden Sanskrit words. They had been written by using a writing brush.</p>

  <p>If one were to look at each word separately, they'd almost appear as nothing more than good works of calligraphy.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng scanned the words one by one and rearranged their order in his mind, a faint sense of discomfort rose in his heart and as his eyes widened, his pupils dilated slightly too.</p>

  <p>"These words!"</p>

  <p>He was too stunned to complete his sentence.</p>

  <p>"Read!" Joy smiled peacefully as she urged Luo Zheng along.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng squinted his eyes a little and he began to read the words aloud.</p>

  <p>"The nature of the cultivation method is to reach eternity with strong will. The natural laws couldn't be comprehended through common methods. If..."</p>

  <p>Surprisingly enough, these sentences weren't unintelligible to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As he followed his thoughts in order to read the words aloud, a subtle feeling washed over him.</p>

  <p>This feeling was similar to what Luo Zheng had felt back when he was cultivating the Divine Dao. There were certain mysterious and complex meanings hidden amongst the words, but their meaning was actually more complicated than that of the Divine Dao themselves.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng didn't have too much difficulty speaking the words.</p>

  <p>However, as time went on, he felt more and more stressed with every word that escaped his mouth.</p>

  <p>Once he'd read over one hundred words, he felt his tongue going numb.</p>

  <p>Once he'd gotten through two hundred words, his tongue started flicking and he spoke with a lisp, as if he was drunk. His head began to feel dizzy. After five hundred words, he could feel the very depths of his soul shaking.</p>

  <p>Joy did nothing but look at Luo Zheng react and smile.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had finished reading out eight hundred words, he had a faint hallucination.</p>

  <p>He felt as though he had been placed in a sea of fire or as if he was standing on ice and snow without wearing any clothes, running forward as he grinded his teeth together.</p>

  <p>With every step he took, his entire body suffered great pain!</p>

  <p>The pain wasn't caused by a specific soul attack or even a physical injury. It was instead caused by some kind of spiritual oppression.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clearly felt that the distance he had crossed was very short. He had only taken a few small steps, and the road ahead appeared endless. It was the end though, that attracted him so much. He felt as though he was obliged to cross all that distance in order to reach the end, no matter the price he had to pay.</p>

  <p>When he had read out nine hundred words, his teeth clenched shut, and he felt a rumbling sound in his head, as if something had hit his soul. He suddenly felt dizzy and took a few steps back before he could find his balance again. He stared at the words in complete and utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Master, you've already proven how amazing you are by reading nine hundred words on your first attempt," Immortal Book said with a smiling tone. "But now, the young master can read one thousand and two hundred words. And he's constantly writing them out as he reads," he added.</p>

  <p>"What? How is that even possible?" Luo Zheng's eyes widened in awe.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Immortal Book had just said, Joy equally felt quite shocked once more. "Do you mean to say that the kid can read one thousand and two hundred of these words?"</p>

  <p>Immortal Book chuckled and said, "It's one thousand, two hundred and thirty-six words, to be exact. In fact, the young master just recently set this record!"</p>

  <p>As it turned out, over the past few years, Luo Nian had been deciphering the golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words' content left by Bromley was very rich.</p>

  <p>According to general speculation, these golden Sanskrit words originated from extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of creature or race, they had to have a very complex culture. The golden Sanskrit didn't necessary record all cultivation methods, and a lot of other factors were equally taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>The golden Sanskrit words that Luo Nian had deciphered in the past talked about a vast, boundless, blue lake situated in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The golden Sanskrit words Luo Nian deciphered afterward were even more outrageous. Among them, a few strange recipes and a couple funny adventure travel notes were included.</p>

  <p>These golden Sanskrit words weren't very valuable. The only thing they were useful for was increasing knowledge about extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>The six golden Sanskrit words hanging on the side hall's wall appeared at the same time. When Luo Nian deciphered the words, he discovered something strange. These six golden Sanskrit words contained six thousand and four hundred words in total. The content didn't make much sense, especially if one looked at each word separately. Upon connecting them together though, he felt they held a special truth.</p>

  <p>And it was this truth that had piqued Luo Nian's and the others' interest.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Yudie and the other women also tried to read such words, but they couldn't hold on for more than sixty of them.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Nian persevered and read 300 words in his first attempt, but from the 300th word onward, the pressure he faced increased greatly. If he continued to comprehend the meaning of these words, he would pass out in an instant.</p>

  <p>Yudie pitied her son, and she even quarreled with him, completely preventing him from studying these strange words.</p>

  <p>Saul and Immortal Book, on the other hand, were on Luo Nian's side and they encouraged him to continue deciphering.</p>

  <p>With his repeated attempts, Luo Nian had gradually mastered quite a few of the rules. Now, he was even able to read a word at the same time as he wrote one. As he kept advancing through the words, he eventually covered over a thousand and two hundred. It was safe to say that he really was a persistent boy!</p>

  <p>"How could this be... I do feel that Luo Nian's soul is indeed much stronger than that of any ordinary person. That said, it's impossible for him to have achieved such a thing!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just couldn't seem to understand.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing that Luo Zheng was in complete disbelief, Joy smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"Because the Truth of Divine Dao doesn't test whether your soul is strong or not. And what it does to you isn't to help cultivate your soul either. It's helping you understand your own way of cultivation."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, my own way?" Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>A look of anticipation took over Joy's face, and her voice became clear and melodious. "Way is the path. In the universes, all warriors hope to attain the peak of martial arts and reach the end of such. Once you've reached the end of martial arts, you will reach the end of that path."</p>

  <p>As they listened to Joy speak, Yudie, Freya and the other girls fell silent.</p>

  <p>Currently, they were only at the Soul Sea Realm. There was still a long way to go before they could even think about reaching the end of the martial arts path.</p>

  <p>Whether in the universe or in the divine land, the end of martial arts was the level of world lords. This was also the proving godly warriors' level.</p>

  <p>After reaching this level, if the warrior wanted to step further, they had to master the Divine Dao and become True Gods.</p>

  <p>"What awaits us after the end of the Divine Dao?" Joy asked Luo Zheng out of the blue, fixing her gaze on him.</p>

  <p>"Holy Beings," Luo Zheng answered flatly.</p>

  <p>Joy refused his answer, shaking her head from side to side. "No," she said firmly.</p>

  <p>"Who is more powerful than a Holy Being?" she asked anew. Luo Zheng's face filled even more with confusion.</p>

  <p>Through the clues he had obtained in the past, Luo Zheng was aware that other, more advanced creatures existed within the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, as Holy Jay had said, he himself didn't even know these creatures' forms. To put it simply, he didn't know whether extraordinary creatures were humans or ghosts. Having never seen them himself in fact, he didn't even know if they truly existed.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had studied the golden Sanskrit deeply, and presumably, he had a more profound understanding of it than Joy. It was only normal for his prediction to be more reliable.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even Holy Bromley's adventure indicated that the whole of the chaos was most likely empty.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's knowledge was confined within this wide and extensive divine land. Never had he allowed himself to imagine that, in this world, someone would be even stronger than a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"The end of the Divine Dao is a boundless ocean." Joy's eyes grew darker. "The ocean is filled with a perfect understanding of Divine Dao, which is otherwise called the Sea of Truth."</p>
