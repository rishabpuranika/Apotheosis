<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"How'd it happen?" asked an expert in the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Wilson's face darkened with fury as he raved, "I don't know! There's something off about him. He took my life vitality manifestations and strengthened one of the wolves, giving it an astonishing speed! I'll go back to finish him off."</p>

  <p>Shaking her head, which sent her abundant hair swinging back and forth, the lady objected, "No, if you do it now, you will draw the attention of the two giant puppets, and all the time we've put in, our efforts would be a waste. We don't want that."</p>

  <p>"So, we just let him follow us here?" asked one of the men, as he gave an angry look.</p>

  <p>"We'll have plenty of time to get rid of him after we get in the inner doors. That isn't too difficult for us, is it?" snapped the long-haired woman with a sneer.</p>

  <p>The brat had easily killed Yves and Leon. He had some unusual tricks.</p>

  <p>But, so what? He was nothing compared to the masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Good, that's settled then; Mr. Huang, you and Seymour will kill him as soon as we are admitted into the inner sanctum," ordered the lady with the long hair.</p>

  <p>After reaching an agreement on how to proceed, they ignored Luo Zheng. The woman held out a hand, and dozens of incantations appeared in midair. A strong draft blew past them as the incantations darted to everyone's head.</p>

  <p>The incantations allowed people to move faster, making everyone's speed increase over thirty percent.</p>

  <p>The square stretched before them for dozens of miles, but, the companions reached the inner door in an instant because of how fast they were.</p>

  <p>Relieved they were finally within the inner doors, everyone let out a long sigh. The price of the trip had been a steep one with so many lives lost during the journey.</p>

  <p>A scowl was remained on Wilson's furious face as he thought about how he wanted to crush the masked boy with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>"Well now, there's no need to wait since the boy wants to follow us. We'll just finish him here," commented the long-haired woman, almost giddy with excitement.</p>

  <p>Wilson snorted coldly, "There are so many paths he could choose, but, he's hell-bent on his ruin. But, since his wish is to perish, this place will be his tomb!"</p>

  <p>Standing next to Wilson was a man dressed in a green robe. The man in green was an expert among those in the Illuminating Soul Realm. His name was Seymour, and at that moment he was ready and waiting for his chance to settle a killing strike on the boy as well.</p>

  <p>These two experts from the Illuminating Soul Realm would've been plenty to handle the boy, except this was the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Due to the location, there were far too many variables to take for granted they would be victorious. Prudence demanded they avoid any more trouble.</p>

  <p>Moments later Luo Zheng came through the inner doors wearing a mask, with an enormous wolf walking alongside him. The wolf had been Wilson's two black wolves, until Luo Zheng merged them into one which was twice the size of the originals.</p>

  <p>"Are you guys waiting for me?" asked Luo Zheng as he grinned.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, I wouldn't be taking this so lightly. As a man half-step into the nature level, you should pride on your ability. Still you are not good enough to survive our attack," stated Wilson in a deep voice. For some inexplicable reason, his stomach knotted in apprehension when he saw the grin on the masked boy's face.</p>

  <p>"He's bluffing. Cut the crap and let's get this over," said Seymour sneering. Poised to strike, a green light covering his body began to blink.</p>

  <p>"Hold up," announced Luo Zheng while he waved his hand. When he was sure he had their attention, his smile broadened and he said to Wilson, "Did you notice there's something I didn't bring with me?"</p>

  <p>A puzzled look crossed Wilson's face as he stiffened. Wilson had witnessed Luo Zheng made three wolves under his control. If Wilson remembered correctly, there was a black wolf missing. Before passing through the inner door, the savage black wolf was also beside the masked boy, fiercer and faster than the wolves Wilson had summoned.</p>

  <p>"We've journeyed with the same goal, and I for one, see no reason for us to turn against each other. You have noticed that I strengthened the black wolf, and then I left it outside. Your lightning leopard couldn't compare to the giant puppets, but, if you wish, I can use the black wolf and lure the giant puppets here. Now, I am guessing, no one wants that, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice was flat as he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had used a Phoenix Crystal to strengthen the black wolf, and then left it by the large square on the other side of the doorway. Even though the wolf wasn't right next to Luo Zheng, it was still under his control, and with lighting speed it would be a simple matter to lure the giant puppets there.</p>

  <p>Since with one word from Luo Zheng, two giant puppets would be lured in and no one there would survive, the men stopped to think things through before laying a hand on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You asked for it!" shouted Wilson. His temper ignited by Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"Such a clever boy!" commented the woman with long hair, as she shot Luo Zheng a venomous look. Her beautiful eyes were murderously cold. "I have to say, that's actually really smart. Normally, there isn't a place for a man who hasn't entered the nature level, but� you've got a good point. If we don't cooperate, more trouble will plague us while we are at the fairy palace."</p>

  <p>Nodding, Zheng's smile spread, widening to reveal a row of gleaming white teeth before he commented, "Yes, that's the spirit. It's not cool for us to fight with each other."</p>
