<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng was strong, but Diego didn't expect that he'd not be hurt by the arrow at all.</p>

  <p>To make matters even worse, Zheng had used that same arrow to escape from his water net and killed Bryan with his sword as well!</p>

  <p>How was that possible?</p>

  <p>In panic, Diego pushed off the ground with his legs and quickly slid backwards on the sea.</p>

  <p>Although he moved backward at an extremely fast speed, Zheng followed him behind more quickly.</p>

  <p>Before the sword radiance that Zheng had unleashed caught up to Diego, Zheng had transformed into a streak of lightning and ran towards him.</p>

  <p>"Water Vortex Array!"</p>

  <p>Diego uttered the command as he retreated and frantically waved his arms.</p>

  <p>In turn, dozens of waterspouts rose from the sea and rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Despite the harsh water out to whip at Zheng, he didn't even blink. He simply continued to wield his Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>The waterspouts that attacked him did not stand against the Shadow Bearing Sword at all. The sword sliced through them and they quickly fell apart one after the other.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>After he was done with the waterspouts, he quickly approached Diego and thrust his sword through his chest.</p>

  <p>Then, he swung his long sword and pulled Diego towards his back.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the sword radiance that he had previously released took over with a loud roar.</p>

  <p>When Diego saw that the sword radiance was about to kill him, he gritted his teeth and a strange force flew out from his elixir field.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>His body suddenly turned into a transparent and shapeless thing, until it fully became a mass of water that flowed into the sea alongside the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>It was the Shapeless Water, the consummate level theurgy of the Parting Water Godly Way.</p>

  <p>This theurgy could instantly dissolve the body and merge it with water.</p>

  <p>If given enough time, one could even use this theurgy to control the sea, summon the storms, and churn the waves.</p>

  <p>Now, Diego had used it to run away out of desperation.</p>

  <p>After all, this particular world had been sealed off, so he couldn't use the Grand Teleportation technique either.</p>

  <p>They had blocked Zheng's way, and also their own--but what they didn't know was that they would face such a powerful monster.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng was slightly surprised. He sneered and bent lightly, placing his palm on the surface of the seawater.</p>

  <p>"The Elementary Fire Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A raging fireball exploded under the sea and enveloped the waters around Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the fireball had cleared out the whole body of water.</p>

  <p>Even Diego who had resorted to using the Shapeless Water had also evaporated.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he had freed himself from the water net, killed Bryan, and made Diego evaporate--all of which took him about six seconds.</p>

  <p>His speed was otherworldly fast that people couldn't even react!</p>

  <p>Walton, who stood and watched on top of the mountain, was utterly dumbfounded by what he saw.</p>

  <p>Bryan and Diego certainly weren't weak, but Zheng had killed them so quickly. Walton really found it hard to accept what had just happened.</p>

  <p>"Gurgle..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng had evaporated the water in a ten-mile radius, the sea from other areas surged continuously and filled the vacuum area under his feet.</p>

  <p>"If you want death, just follow me. I don't mind taking your lives," Zheng said coldly.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, Shahn, and Walton froze with terror as they heard what he said.</p>

  <p>Of course, Rachelle wasn't stupid and had been very cautious all this time. She never chose to fight Zheng head on.</p>

  <p>At that point, however, she clearly realized that Zheng's strength was way beyond her expectations.</p>

  <p>The man whom they had oppressed before had become invincible.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng turned into a flash of lightning once again and flew forward.</p>

  <p>With gritted teeth, Rachelle hissed, "Tell the other consummate True Gods who are on the way here not to act rashly. Let's continue to follow Zheng!"</p>

  <p>After that, she and Shahn turned into blood red lights once more and trailed Zheng.</p>

  <p>The thing was, it wasn't easy for Zheng to defeat Rachelle since she was much stronger than Diego and Bryan.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! I will kill you today!" Walton roared to the sea surface. His eyes cast a determined glance at the direction the three had gone.</p>

  <p>Then, he carried the huge sword shield and followed them in a fit of rage.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, puffs of air escaped quickly from Zheng's lips as he galloped along the coastline between the two regions.</p>

  <p>He didn't anticipate that the coastline was too long.</p>

  <p>As he traversed through the coast, he saw two black dots in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Two more consummate True Gods!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, there were two grey-haired old men from the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>Unlike Diego and Bryan, they didn't attack immediately and instead, kept a certain distance when they saw Zheng.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, more and more consummate True Gods appeared.</p>

  <p>They were from the Qin Clan, the Zhao Clan and the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, they were all shocked at the very start of their encounter with Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they wondered why Shahn sent a message to them with his life vitality to warn them not to make a move first.</p>

  <p>That had made them even more curious.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had reached the consummation of True God Realm, he didn't look so terrifying.</p>

  <p>Still, the consummate True Gods didn't do anything--just like Shahn had said. They simply surrounded Zheng, one after another.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Zheng just watched them with cold eyes as he flew forward.</p>

  <p>In the Snake Spirit Region, Tianming had reached the divine city located at the very edge through the transmission array.</p>

  <p>After he had left the divine city with two consummate True Gods from the Dongfang Clan, he began to use the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>As of the moment, all the consummate True Gods headed towards the Sea Vessel Region. Of course, Tianming couldn't fall behind.</p>

  <p>When Tianming arrived at the boundary of the Snake Spirit Region, he saw the mountains were on the left and the sea waves were on the right.</p>

  <p>Those two formed the boundary between the Square Sky Region and the Sea Vessel Region.</p>

  <p>"Both the spaces of the Sea Vessel Region and the Square Sky Region have been sealed. Thus, we can't use the Grand Teleportation technique once we enter. If we go along this coastline, we should be able to block our target in the Sea Vessel Region," he said.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea. Can we also ambush the target in the Snake Spirit Region?" a consummate True God from the Dongfang Clan asked.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and said, "After entering the Snake Spirit Region, our target can run away using the Grand Teleportation technique--as long as he has reached the consummation of True God Realm. If I'm not mistaken, he's indeed a consummate True God."</p>

  <p>If the target was not a consummate True God, Rachelle and Shahn, who had sent the message, would've killed him already. They clearly wouldn't hold off until now.</p>

  <p>Yet, Tianming was still a bit confused. If the target was just a consummate True God, then it shouldn't be too difficult for Rachelle and Shahn to deal with him with their power. Why did they delay it till now?</p>

  <p>At that moment, three spatial fluctuations suddenly appeared in front of Tianming, and it wasn't long before three more consummate True Gods came.</p>

  <p>A frown tugged at Tianming's lips at the sight of the group's leader. It was Troy.</p>

  <p>The two of them hadn't been on the best terms for a long time. They looked at each other. Troy snorted coldly and took his people to enter the Sea Vessel Region without a word.</p>
