  <p>Catching Calum looking at him, Sellers chuckled. "I don't know much about Luo Zheng. He has already passed the third floor of the Sword Tower, and has fought with Milo once."</p>

  <p>"What was the result?" queried Calum.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng lost," Sellers said bluntly with a slight shrug.</p>

  <p>"Milo has been in the mountain for a long time, and his cultivation level is higher than Luo Zheng's. It's not surprising Luo Zheng lost. But it's hard to tell this young man's potential," Calum said, scratching his chin.</p>

  <p>Then, he raised the array plate again. "If he can climb the mountain under the second-class difficulty, he might be able to be compared with Milo's past self."</p>

  <p>Although Sellers gave his recommendation for Luo Zheng to go up the mountain, to be clear, he just wanted to do Qiu Yinhe a favor. One way or another, Luo Zheng was qualified to climb the mountain.</p>

  <p>However, in actuality, Sellers was also curious to see just how strong Luo Zheng truly was.</p>

  <p>"Please make the decision by yourself, Master Calum," said Sellers, bowing slightly.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng got hurt, Qiu Yinhe would put the blame on him. Sellers didn't want to be used as a scapegoat.</p>

  <p>Watching Luo Zheng gradually recover his speed, Calum gritted his teeth as he changed the array plate again.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of the Cloudy Mountain Array on the Dragon Path could only reach up to third class. However, a second class of difficulty was later added with the use of the Heavenly Magic Array.</p>

  <p>Therefore, once someone started the second-class difficulty, the Heavenly Magic Array was also activated. That was exactly what happened to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng took another step, flying swords shot towards him.</p>

  <p>The flying swords alone were nothing to him. He indifferently moved forward at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Then, some of the flying swords collided with his arms.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The flying swords released clouds of smoke and suddenly transformed into chains that wrapped themselves around Luo Zheng's arms. At the end of each chain was a large, cone-shaped weight.</p>

  <p>"Wow, the weights are heavy!</p>

  <p>Each of them probably contains one divine megaton of force."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grunted as he struggled to keep moving forward, despite the chains.</p>

  <p>He frowned as he realized that back when he first entered the Dragon City, he couldn't even lift these heavy weights.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Magic Array was changeable. This was just one of its changes. When faced with the winged Jin Wu, this magic array could drag countless Jin Wu down the mountain.</p>

  <p>Two or three weights usually wouldn't hinder Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the further he ran, the more flying swords volleyed towards him, exploding into more weights.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng was dragging sixty weights, which meant that he was carrying sixty Jun of force!</p>

  <p>It was like sixty his past selves who just entered the Sea of Truth were dragging him.</p>

  <p>Even people as powerful as Luo Zheng had their limits. Beads of sweat dripped down his face as he struggled to keep moving.</p>

  <p>"I have to get rid of these weights," he said as he panted.</p>

  <p>If he kept at it, he knew more and more chains would coil around his body, weighing him down till he wouldn't be able to move.</p>

  <p>Without further hesitation, Luo Zheng summoned the Snow Sword and hacked at the chains.</p>

  <p>The metal and iron collided together, but no crisp sound was heard. It seemed that he cut into the air.</p>

  <p>"It seems this magic array can't be broken by brute force," Luo Zheng muttered in frustration.</p>

  <p>While the weights and chains were just an illusion, the many Jun of force wasn't.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>While he hesitated, more long swords exploded in front of him.</p>

  <p>As the chains wrapped around Luo Zheng, he realized he was carrying around 100 weights by now. Buckling under this much weight, he could barely take another step.</p>

  <p>In the Cloudy Mountain Palace, Calum smiled. "Milo had also been trapped for a long time at that stage," he reminisced. "However, he is truly a genius.</p>

  <p>He controlled the swords with his mind, ignoring the obstacle illusions, successfully breaking the magic array eventually. If Luo Zheng can't break it, I'm afraid he won't be able to reach the top of the mountain."</p>

  <p>However, Calum had promised before that, even if Luo Zheng was trapped in the second-class difficulty, he would personally send him up the mountain.</p>

  <p>They were now making things difficult for Luo Zheng, testing him to see his true strength.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>More and more flying swords hung around Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>After a while, more than a hundred swords weighed him down.</p>

  <p>The heavy weight was pulling him down. It was difficult for him to even stand up straight.</p>

  <p>He thought he heard his bones crunching under the great force.</p>

  <p>"If I want to break this magic array, I have to use some special methods. In that case..."</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes, brows furrowed. He awoke his Eye of Will, and he felt his inner world tremble slightly. When he opened his eyes again, his right eye emitted a pale white light.</p>

  <p>The world he saw with his right eye had changed into another shape.</p>

  <p>His left eye could clearly see the swords flying towards him. However, from the vision of his right eye, he saw the flying swords as magic symbols floating towards him. The moment they got too close, they burned a bright red and transformed into a cloud of dust that stuck to his back.</p>

  <p>That was why he could feel the chains weighing him down!</p>

  <p>"I see,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said with a smile. Immediately, he began to tear off the magic symbols that had accumulated on his back.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A burst of white smoke exploded, and the magic symbols were quickly burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>The weights that Luo Zheng saw in his left eye all disappeared.</p>

  <p>After that, he felt much relaxed and stretched his body. Then he turned into a ray of light and flew along the Dragon Path.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw the real world with his right eye, where magic symbols were floating towards him. With his left eye he saw an illusion, where flying swords were shooting towards him.</p>

  <p>"Break into pieces!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng brandished the Snow Sword, a stream of thin sword radiance was created.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance touched the magic symbols and immediately cut them into pieces.</p>

  <p>The magic array was not a threat to Luo Zheng. For him, the difficulty at the second class was even easier for him than the third. Now climbing the mountain was like walking on the flat ground.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's speed..."</p>

  <p>In the Cloudy Mountain Palace, Calum and Sellers were flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>It took less than ten minutes for Luo Zheng to destroy the magic array after Calum activated the difficulty of the second class.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Magic Array was not difficult for him at all.</p>

  <p>There was an essential difference between the Heavenly Magic Array and the Cloudy Mountain Array.</p>

  <p>The Cloudy Mountain Array was used for the assessment, but the Heavenly Magic Array was used to resist the enemy.</p>

  <p>Since the Taiyi Heaven Palace was built, very few people had managed to destroy the Heavenly Magic Array with their own strength. Luo Zheng was merely at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, but he made it!</p>

  <p>"How did he make it?"</p>

  <p>"Can Luo Zheng also control the swords with his mind?"</p>

  <p>Calum and Sellers could only see his figure on the array plate and didn't know how Luo Zheng did that.</p>

  <p>"Shall we activate the first-class difficulty?" Sellers asked with a mischievous smile.</p>

  <p>Calum shook his head immediately and clutched the plate tightly. Fearing he wouldn't be able to resist the temptation, he said decisively, "No. The first-class difficulty will kill him. If anything bad happens to Luo Zheng on the Dragon Path, Master Qiu Yinhe will have me killed!"</p>

  <p>"Relax, it was just a suggestion!" Sellers laughed.</p>

  <p>Together, they returned their focus towards Luo Zheng. Much to their surprise, Luo Zheng had already almost made it to the mountain's peak. "That's half the time it took Milo..." Calum murmured.</p>
