<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng could feel the auras of the four invisible swords even with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>They were definitely the four swords from the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword fiercely attacked Zheng head-on.</p>

  <p>The other three swords circled in from the side, trying to surround Zheng.</p>

  <p>As someone who was very familiar with the Gods Killing Sword Array, there was no way Zheng would allow himself to be trapped in it.</p>

  <p>In the face of the Buddha Emperor Sword's attack, Zheng didn't retreat, but instead moved forward.</p>

  <p>When he was just a foot away from the Buddha Emperor Sword, he wiggled his body like a fish and brushed past the sword.</p>

  <p>In this way, he easily left the four long swords behind.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He tapped his foot lightly on the ground, and then dashed toward the phantom in front of the gate.</p>

  <p>It was not surprising for an ordinary phantom to have the same face as his.</p>

  <p>What was surprising, however, was that the phantom in front of him could use the Gods Killing Sword Array. This made Zheng curious about what the phantom was.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the phantom standing in front of the gate just smiled at him and then took a few steps in the other direction.</p>

  <p>As it moved, its voice reached Zheng's ears.</p>

  <p>"Follow me. You have no other choice."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened when he heard these words.</p>

  <p>Although he would be walking right into a trap, he had come too far to turn back now.</p>

  <p>Besides, the only way out that he knew of was to go back through the black water, but the Devil and the unknown creatures were waiting for him there.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how to deal with them.</p>

  <p>When he opened the door in front of him, a gust of cold air rushed past him.</p>

  <p>In front of his eyes was a huge ice palace.</p>

  <p>The whole palace had been built with huge ice blocks. The rich cold air turned into a milk-white mist as it rushed past Zheng who was outside the bronze gate.</p>

  <p>Before long, Zheng's face was covered with a layer of frost.</p>

  <p>Enveloped by the cold air, he felt like the blood in his body was about to freeze.</p>

  <p>"The air is too cold!"</p>

  <p>Zheng stomped his foot lightly, and a wave of internal momentum spread out along the sole of his foot and turned into a flame.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>As the flame roared wildly, it forced all the cold air in and around Zheng's body away.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng looked up again and saw the phantom.</p>

  <p>It was standing not far away with a provocative look on its face. Then, it floated ahead, going deeper into the strong chill air.</p>

  <p>As soon as the phantom moved, Zheng spread out the thunder wings on his back.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Although he had no idea what was going on, he wanted to capture the phantom first.</p>

  <p>By flying, he was able to easily narrow the distance of a few hundred feet between him and the phantom.</p>

  <p>The moment he spotted the phantom in the milky white air, he stretched out his hand to grab it.</p>

  <p>"Do you still think I'm a phantom?" the phantom asked as it suddenly turned around and punched Zheng in the palm.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Even before the phantom's fist hit him, he felt the force that it carried.</p>

  <p>"The power..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>The phantom's power was actually comparable to his own. This was no ordinary phantom then.</p>

  <p>Since he was thrown off guard, he couldn't adjust his body in time and found himself flying backward.</p>

  <p>After flying more than a hundred feet back in the air, he exerted his power and pressed himself back on the ground.</p>

  <p>Sizz...</p>

  <p>His feet left two long and thin marks on the crystal-clear ice surface as he slid to a stop.</p>

  <p>As for the phantom, it was still walking ahead with a faint smile on its face.</p>

  <p>After the confrontation just now, Zheng was a lot more cautious.</p>

  <p>Few consummate True Gods had been able to compete with him in terms of strength. And after he had absorbed the Wild God Power, even Demi-holy Beings were far inferior to him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, phantoms were much weaker than real beings.</p>

  <p>Even phantoms created by the Parting Water Godly Way had only 40 to 50 percent of the strength of the real beings. As for phantoms created by the Grand Purple Aura Technique, there was a large number of them, but they didn't even have a thousandth of the strength of the real beings.</p>

  <p>"Am I in an illusion now?" Zheng asked No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"No," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had accidentally fallen into an illusion in the Reincarnation Land, Zheng had become vigilant.</p>

  <p>The phantom in front of him didn't make sense at all, so the most logical conclusion was that he was in an illusion.</p>

  <p>However, if this place was an illusion, No. 9527 would know.</p>

  <p>"But there's something very strange about the phantom," added No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem to be a phantom at all. It's just you," No. 9527 said in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng became more suspicious.</p>

  <p>After hesitating for a few moments, Zheng had no choice but to bite the bullet and follow the phantom.</p>

  <p>The ice palace was very large and went on and on, just like the cave.</p>

  <p>After passing through several layers of cold air and many gates for about an hour, the phantom leading the way finally stopped.</p>

  <p>It turned around and said to Zheng, "You can wait here."</p>

  <p>"Why should I listen to you?" Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The phantom smiled and gently flipped its hand. The space ring on its finger flashed and a long sword appeared in its hand.</p>

  <p>"The Shadow Bearing Sword?"</p>

  <p>An incredible expression appeared in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The phantom's Shadow Bearing Sword was the same as Zheng's. What was more, the phantom's habits, mannerisms, and behavior were also exactly the same as Zheng's.</p>

  <p>"Because I'm you. You have to listen to yourself," the phantom said softly.</p>

  <p>"A demonic trick!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps everyone would react so disbelievingly if they came face to face with a being who looked exactly like them.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was beginning to agree with what No. 9527 had said. It was likely that this phantom was him.</p>

  <p>But how could there be an exact copy of him in the divine land?</p>

  <p>Its martial arts, cultivation system, and everything else were the same as his. But even so, how could it have a Shadow Bearing Sword?</p>

  <p>The one-of-a-kind sword had personally been given to Zheng by Harper, so how could there be another one?</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>With a flash of light, Zheng's own Shadow Bearing Sword appeared in his hand, and a ray of sword radiance shot towards the phantom.</p>

  <p>"Haha..."</p>

  <p>The phantom chuckled and swung its Shadow Bearing Sword at the same time.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The two swords collided with each other with a crisp sound.</p>

  <p>"Even the internal momentum is the same!" Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>He cultivated plenty of Godly Ways, so the Ways-blending Energy contained in his Gods-intimidating Strike was very complicated. But the energy that the phantom's strike had released was the same.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the phantom even had the same Godly Tile that Zheng had.</p>

  <p>"As I said, I am you, and you are me. How can you defeat me?" The phantom laughed again.</p>
