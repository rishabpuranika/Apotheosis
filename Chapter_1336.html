<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1336 You Were Shouting So Loudly </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng had always been curious about this so-called "big shot." Not having much information, he had been a little wary of him or her.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the other party was spying on him from the shadows.</p>

  <p>But just how did the person learn of his existence? And how did this person discover that he was in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place?</p>

  <p>So when he heard the elder's announcement, Zheng immediately stood up.</p>

  <p>He followed the elder to the hall that he had been before.</p>

  <p>In the hall, all the elders of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place were already in their seats. The person who occupied the host's seat was not the Saint Lord, but in fact a woman.</p>

  <p>This woman wore a long skirt sporting nine colors. The dress was made from the feathers of nine legendary beasts, which explained the nine different colors. The light blue feathers were the tail feathers of an ice phoenix and actually emitted cold air. As for the dark red feathers, they belonged to the tail of a fire phoenix. The cyan feathers were the softest ones from the back of a Celestial Mouse.</p>

  <p>This dress was priceless!</p>

  <p>The problem was that so many precious materials were wasted in order to decorate the dress. Clearly, the maker of this colorful dress was an extravagant person.</p>

  <p>A pair of white, small feet encased in a pair of wooden clogs rocked back and forth. Her gaze lightly swept over the elders in the hall.</p>

  <p>Whenever anyone met her gaze, their hearts would tremble slightly.</p>

  <p>In truth, this woman's cultivation level wasn't very terrifying. She was almost a world lord.</p>

  <p>And in this hall, the Saint Lord's cultivation level was equivalent to a world lord. Of course, there was only one lord of a supreme world, and the lord of the Spirit Reading World was the Saint Lord of the Spirit Reading Sacred Place, not the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Elder Gong, too, was also almost a world lord, which meant that his cultivation level was on par with the woman's.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't the woman's cultivation level or strength that intimidated everybody, but her identity.</p>

  <p>She was one of leaders of the thirteen palaces. But more importantly, her father was a Supreme Lord, which meant she was a Supreme Lord descendant. Therefore, she enjoyed a high position in the alliance!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, several warriors appeared in the hall. One of them was emitting an aura that was several times stronger than that of the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>When he entered the main hall, he faced the lady and bowed lightly before her, saying, "Welcome to our Spirit Reading World. I'm the lord of the Spirit Reading World."</p>

  <p>He was the true lord of the supreme world, and also the master of the strongest tenth-grade sacred place in the Spirit Reading World.</p>

  <p>This time, the leader of the Mist Palace had personally come to the Spirit Reading World. Although she did not visit the Spirit Reading Sacred Place and instead went straight to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, the world lord still had to come and greet her personally.</p>

  <p>A trace of impatience appeared on her face. The Spirit Reading World was only a distant supreme world. If it wasn't for Zheng, she probably would have never come here. As for the world lord, she wasn't interested in him or the niceties at all.</p>

  <p>But he was, after all, the lord of a supreme world so the least she could do was smile politely in response. The world lord sat on the second chair, which was closer to the host's seat than that of the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The world lord was extremely surprised to learn that the leader of the Mist Palace had arrived.</p>

  <p>He had received the news earlier that an extraordinary warrior from the Lower World had appeared in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place and had been selected by the thirteen palaces, but he hadn't taken it seriously at the time.</p>

  <p>A sizable number of warriors had ascended from the Lower World, so it wasn't strange for formidable talents to appear occasionally even if they were chosen by the thirteen palaces. The universe was so huge that there was always a good chance that such a person would appear.</p>

  <p>The question was what made the leader of the Mist Palace take the trouble to come here for that warrior?</p>

  <p>It was a mere warrior from the Lower World! How could a warrior like that be so eye-catching for her? Although it was impossible to enroll this warrior in the Spirit Reading Sacred Place, he still wanted to take a good look at just who this special warrior was.</p>

  <p>"He still isn't here?" Yolande grumbled in a low voice.</p>

  <p>She spoke softly, but the people in the hall did hear her. A hint of a smile played on the world lord's face. Although his Spirit Reading Sacred Place and the Spiritual Force Sacred Place both belonged to the alliance, they were both in the same supreme world and were competing with each other.</p>

  <p>As for the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, a hint of embarrassment appeared on his face. He replied, "He should be here soon. Please wait for a little while."</p>

  <p>Barely had the words left his mouth than Zheng strode into the hall. His eyes were drawn to the colorful dress when he just stepped into the hall.</p>

  <p>When his eyes met hers, he chuckled and said, "So it's you, Yolande!"</p>

  <p>The mystery was finally unraveled after a long period of suspense.</p>

  <p>All the elders in the hall gasped loudly as they stared at Zheng in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Even the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place and the lord of the Spirit Reading World were staring at Zheng with a strange look. Wasn't Zheng being a little too bold by calling out her name?</p>

  <p>Nobody was aware that Zheng had encountered two of Yolande's clones.</p>

  <p>He had always treated her as an equal. Over time, he had gotten used to it, and when he saw her again, he was pleasantly surprised. He could tell that she held a high position going by how the other warriors treated her, but he was simply unable to treat her as an elder.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that her temperament was completely different now compared to when they were in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Of course, this mystery had already been explained to Zheng by the cyan dragon earlier.</p>

  <p>The two Yolandes he had met in the Lower World were her clones. The Soul Split Spell still had its own flaws. The emotions and memories of these clones were incomplete, and that meant that there were flaws in their personalities. The actions of the clone in the Eastern Region and the one in the Tower of Sin were very weird.</p>

  <p>They weren't exactly robotic but they lacked emotions such as joy, anger, sadness and happiness.</p>

  <p>As for the woman in front of him, she seemed to be completely different and so was her aura, or perhaps it could be said that she looked more "human."</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled lightly at Zheng and said, "I already told you, I wouldn't intervene in your business, but you still came here. Since you are already in my territory, I naturally have no choice but to take you away. I just hope that those people from the Celestial Position race do not come looking for me."</p>

  <p>The audience tensed again at this exchange between Zheng and Yolande.</p>

  <p>'This guy has been targeted by the Celestial Position race?' they all wondered scratching their heads.</p>

  <p>Although the Celestial Position warriors were few, they were all elites.</p>

  <p>And while their actions and goals were quite bizarre, no one dared to look down on them.</p>

  <p>The key was that it was better to join the Celestial Position race than to join the alliance. Of course, the conditions to join the Celestial Position race were harsher, and it was not easy for warriors in the Upper World to be recognized or respected by the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and continued, "And how did you know where to find me?"</p>

  <p>Yolande actually smiled and rolled her eyes, giving him a playful look.</p>

  <p>She responded, "You were shouting so loudly that I would be deaf if I didn't hear you."</p>

  <p>When Zheng had been using his Roaring Token to look for Yan, Yolande had heard him and figured out his identity. She had collected the names of all the people who had ascended to the 3, 000 supreme worlds in the last year. Scanning the names on the list in her hand, she had found Zheng's name in just five minutes. There were actually two warriors with the same name.</p>

  <p>Many warriors ascended from the Lower World, and there were cases where people shared the same name. However, after Yolande investigated the appearance and other characteristics of the two warriors, she confirmed that he had ascended to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>However, at that time, she had been busy gathering her clones, so it was not a convenient time for her to go find him. Once she had collected all her clones, she had hurried over from the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately understood what was going on. She had identified his voice when he had been using the Roaring Token. She must have known that his Roaring Token was unique.</p>

  <p>The faces of the world lord of the Spirit Reading World and the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place turned serious. "He was shouting so loudly? What does that mean?"</p>
