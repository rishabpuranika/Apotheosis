  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Feather Holy Sea was similar to the Cursed Land in that it was also located at the center of a continent. To most martial practitioners, it was also a forbidden area.</p>

  <p>Still, there was a fundamental difference between the two. The Cursed Land was a forbidden area for high ranked martial artists, while the Feather Holy Sea was forbidden to the low ranked martial artists.</p>

  <p>Every year, the four divine kingdoms would join forces to explore the Feather Holy Sea. The sacred place left behind by the Dragon Lineage Human was an inexhaustible trove to them. Apart from the resources in the endless sea around them, the most important part of their development was the secret lands in the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the rulers of the four divine kingdoms, the Feather Holy Sea was the most precious treasure of all.</p>

  <p>All of the selected martial artists of the Jade Martial House boarded a huge ark which was something like a palace in the sky, with hundreds of floors above and below it. It was evidently large enough to accommodate tens of thousands of people.</p>

  <p>Following the other martial artists who had passed the examination, Luo Luo Zheng entered the ark. After it ascended into the sky, it sped off toward the northwest.</p>

  <p>All of the Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists were extremely excited about having passed the test.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder they were ecstatic. Those who were chosen by the four divine kingdoms to gain experience in the Feather Holy Sea would eventually become the proud sons of the heavens.</p>

  <p>It was known that out of the four divine kingdoms, 99% of Soul Sea Realm masters had achieved good results on their first trip to the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>The secret lands were a yardstick for the assessment of potential martial artists in the divine kingdoms. Every martial artist at the Virtual Tribulation Realm tried his best, sparing no effort.</p>

  <p>"Wow? It's so beautiful! I've always heard that the Feather Holy Sea is golden, but this is the first time I've seen it for myself!"</p>

  <p>"It's said that the golden light within is the power left behind by the blood sacrifice of billions of lives from the Dragon Lineage Human."</p>

  <p>Many rushed to the deck of the ark to admire the sea from high up in the sky.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng stood on the deck, admiring the golden waters. He could feel the power of blood sacrifice within the golden light. The defeat of the Dragon Lineage Human and the sacrifices of billions of lives must have left immense dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p>Trying to focus his gaze further away in the distance, he couldn't find any traces of the secret lands. Its secret was still enveloped by the ocean.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's guess was right, the four secret lands should be four islands on the Feather Holy Sea. However, even though the Feather Holy Sea was merely an inland sea, the islands still weren't visible.</p>

  <p>Patience was something he dearly needed on his way to his destination.</p>

  <p>These days, he was anxious more often than not. At such times, the anxiety was useless. Although he no longer had a rival in the Central Region, his strength was not enough to take down the entirety of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Although the ark advanced at an extreme speed, it still took them two days and three nights to reach their destination. On the morning of the third day, a large river finally appeared before them.</p>

  <p>"It's the West Dragon River! We're at the entrance!"</p>

  <p>One end of the West Dragon River was connected to the Feather Holy Sea. It was a spectacular sight. The golden water from the sea seemed to overflow like wine from a glass. Even though a corner of the Feather Holy Sea was connected to the river, the golden water didn't mix into the river.</p>

  <p>This section of the water was an azure river. The upstream section suddenly turned golden, and the connection between the two had been extremely abrupt.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the great river, there were already over twenty giant arks docked. It seemed that the martial artists of the other martial houses had also arrived.</p>

  <p>The ark of the Jade Martial House slowly came to a stop. Under the leadership of the three Soul Sea Realm masters, the other Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists left the ark.</p>

  <p>A huge palace lay a few dozen miles to the side of the river. In front of it was a square over ten thousand acres in size, where many martial artists had gathered.</p>

  <p>"So many martial artists from the four divine kingdoms," Luo Luo Zheng muttered to himself as he saw the area.</p>

  <p>Apart from the Harlen Divine Kingdom, once the Feather Holy Sea was opened, the York Divine Kingdom, the Wind Divine Kingdom, and the Star Field Divine Kingdom also followed.</p>

  <p>This was an important day when all of the martial artists from the four divine kingdoms could gather together.</p>

  <p>In the massive square, the younger generation of martial artists occupied their own territories. Many Life and Death Realm powerhouses and Soul Sea Realm masters occupied the steps in front of the palace.</p>

  <p>In a glance, Luo Luo Zheng found out that there were over thirty Soul Sea Realm masters standing at the top of the stairs.</p>

  <p>Even though they were quite a distance away from Luo Luo Zheng, he could still feel their terrifying auras.</p>

  <p>"The resources in the four divine kingdoms are much better than those in the Central Region. In their eyes, the Central Region is merely a small, savage land. I've killed two Soul Sea Realm masters from the York Divine Kingdom. What will they do to me?"</p>

  <p>In truth, what Luo Luo Zheng was most worried about was encountering the Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Back in Mist's celestial tomb, Luo Luo Zheng had to come into conflict with the Holy Maiden. If she was here today, it would be a huge hurdle to overcome.</p>

  <p>There were countless powerful martial artists in the Soul Sea Realm. If Luo Luo Zheng was seriously targeted by even one of them, he wouldn't be able to escape.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng followed the disciples of the Jade Martial House into the square, they heard a resounding voice from the palace, "Here comes Jade Martial House from the Harlen Divine Kingdom!"</p>

  <p>The voice was extremely sharp, practically spreading throughout the surrounding hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Together with the other martial artists, Luo Luo Zheng entered the huge square. The three powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm stood on the steps of the palace.</p>

  <p>The positions of the three heads of the Jade Martial House were slightly lower, at the bottom half of the stairs.</p>

  <p>On the square, many Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists took up different positions according to their respective kingdoms. For instance, the Jade Martial House and the Dark Martial House both came from the Harlen Divine Kingdom, so their martial artists grouped together.</p>

  <p>After a while, another huge ark descended from the sky and docked by the river.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the shrill voice was heard again. "Here comes the Wisteria Martial House from the Star Field Divine Kingdom!"</p>

  <p>From the ark, another four Soul Sea Realm masters appeared. They slowly flew up the steps of the palace. Compared to the position of the three heads of the Jade Martial House, the position occupied by the Wisteria Martial House was several steps higher.</p>

  <p>Seeing the scene before him, Luo Luo Zheng understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>This continent was occupied by the four divine kingdoms, but their status was not equal. Some still got the better.</p>

  <p>The Harlen Divine Kingdom might not be the strongest among the kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Although the Jade Martial House was comparable to a sixth-grade sect, it was not the most powerful martial house either. The status of the Wisteria Martial House that had just arrived should be above that of the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Luo Zheng was right.</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms had maintained a subtle balance for many years, but there was a clear difference in strength.</p>

  <p>Over the years, their seating arrangements had frequently changed.</p>

  <p>In the last hundred years, however, the York Divine Kingdom was the most prosperous, followed by the Star Field Divine Kingdom, the Wind Divine Kingdom, and lastly, the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The ranking was based only on a kingdom's power and the combined performance of its younger generation. The leaders of divine kingdoms were war emperors with lives spanning several tens of thousands of years. Under normal circumstances, there wouldn't be any battles among them, so it was difficult to distinguish who was stronger.</p>

  <p>Considering that, the official ranking didn't mean that the Harlen Divine Kingdom was weaker than the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Here comes the Spirit Martial House from the Wind Divine Kingdom!"</p>

  <p>"Here comes the Cloud Dragon Martial House from the York Divine Kingdom!"</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Every martial house had at least a fifth-grade sect's strength. The population of the Soul Sea Realm masters on the steps kept increasing, and more and more Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists arrived at the square.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt a light bloom in the corner of his eyes. Looking up, he saw a light appear in the west. Like a small sun, it quickly rose in the air.</p>

  <p>As the light got closer, Luo Luo Zheng could see that it was a golden palace.</p>

  <p>The dazzling place flew over at an extremely fast speed. In the blink of an eye, it was right by the West Dragon River. Then, deep laughter was heard from within the palace.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Looks like I came too early. The other elders haven't arrived yet."</p>

  <p>Immediately after, Luo Luo Zheng saw hundreds of figures fly out of the golden palace. A middle-aged man with a flushed face was in the lead.</p>

  <p>In a mere glance, Luo Luo Zheng could feel an irresistible Mu Ning from the man. It couldn't be released by soul pressure. It was unique to superior men who had occupied high-ranking positions for a very long time.</p>

  <p>Even Amber of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place didn't have such an Mu Ning. After all, she had only ruled the place for over two hundred years.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only felt it from Xun.</p>

  <p>And of course, Xun's Mu Ning was still even sharper than this person's.</p>

  <p>His Mu Ning was aimed only at the human martial artists, while Xun's could overwhelm almost all living beings.</p>

  <p>"Here comes Scott, the head of the Star Field Divine Kingdom!"</p>

  <p>The sharp sound reverberated again.</p>

  <p>'So he's the ruler of the Star Field Divine Kingdom. The four divine kingdoms are the rulers of this continent. His strength must be at least in the top four here, ' Luo Luo Zheng guessed inwardly.</p>

  <p>Scott merely laughed. Instead of flying up to the palace as the others did, he stayed above the square for a moment, glancing at the many Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists on the square. "Where are the people of my Star Field Divine Kingdom?"</p>

  <p>When they heard their ruler's question, the martial artists, including those from the Wisteria Martial House and other martial houses from the Star Field Divine Kingdom, responded like thunder, "Greetings, my King!</p>

  <p>Here we are!"</p>

  <p>As hundreds of Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists roared all at once, the very ground seemed to tremble.</p>
