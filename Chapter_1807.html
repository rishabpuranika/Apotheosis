<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Observing the small fish in his hand, Zheng was momentarily stunned.</p>

  <p>Creatures formed from life vitality would be restored to life vitality once they moved to the external world. As per this law, since this little fish had been removed from the external world by Zheng, it was bound to be converted into chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>However, the scales of this little fish continued to remain bright silver.</p>

  <p>Also, the strong stench of the fish persevered.</p>

  <p>The little fish struggled in Zheng's hand for a while. But soon, Zheng tossed it gently into the air. It drew an arc in the air and landed in the pond beneath the pavilion, splashing water. Once again it began to swim freely.</p>

  <p>According to Zheng's current understanding, the universe was one level higher than the ordinary inner world.</p>

  <p>Whether people used the visualization technique to visualize treasures or used life vitality to nurture creatures within the inner world, in the end, they would all return to their original state. This was because cultivation was originally meant to seize heaven and earth, and now was the time to return heaven and earth back to heaven and earth where they ultimately belonged.</p>

  <p>As for chaotic energy, there was no point in returning it.</p>

  <p>That was not a product of the heavens and didn't need to be returned.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Zheng began to sigh in his heart. He had never anticipated that crossing the heavens would be such a complex matter!</p>

  <p>For the creatures of the universe, they had to become Godly Geniuses in order to cross the heavens and enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>This was because this was the inner world of a Holy Being. After leaving the inner world, they would return to life vitality. The life vitality of a Holy Being was seized from the divine land, so naturally it had to be returned to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord who had forcefully left the universe would be turned into life vitality, dissipating within the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's fish would not be affected by this restriction! Moreover, all the living creatures within Zheng's inner world could cross the heavens, regardless of strength or cultivation! This was because these creatures came from the chaos!</p>

  <p>"Hold on..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an important question popped into Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>'If everything in the universe would dissipate into life vitality then what about Yan? What will happen to her?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>After being deep in thoughts, the answer finally occurred to him.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, Yan was a creature of the universe. When she had left, she was still young, and her cultivation was not high. It was impossible for her to become a Godly Genius! 'Let alone a True God! There is not even a chance for her to become a True God, ' he realized.</p>

  <p>If it was in the past, Zheng might even suspect that Yan had turned into life vitality and disappeared into the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, Irene had already given him the information and confirmed Yan's location, dispelling his doubts.</p>

  <p>With the help of this information, Zheng seemed pretty positive that the young man who took Yan away could resolve this problem.</p>

  <p>With a burst of wild thoughts, Zheng gradually entered a meditative state and closed his eyes, continuing his cultivation.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the news finally arrived. It turned out there were still three months left until they could be sent to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. But looking at the brighter side, everything would be ready in these three months. The ten Godly Geniuses would begin their journey after three months.</p>

  <p>However, these three months would in no sense be peaceful.</p>

  <p>In the first two months, four Supreme Lords had perished in the universe!</p>

  <p>Amongst them, one was from the Blessed Buddha Land, two from the Humanity Alliance, and one from the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Those that perished were all Supreme Lords of the human race.</p>

  <p>However, the supreme sorcerers of the sorcerer race were also exterminated one by one. Besides, they were all exterminated by the Supreme Lord of Original Sin, the leader of Xuanyuan Clan!</p>

  <p>In the fight between Supreme Lords, it was originally extremely difficult to defeat the opponent. As for Supreme Lord of Original Sin, he had rooted out ten supreme sorcerers within a short period of time. His strength became evident to everyone who witnessed his fight.</p>

  <p>Some of these pieces of news came from Tianming, while others were from the words of Supreme Lords spread out through Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>Zheng also knew that the reason these Supreme Lords were showing off their victory was to boost the morale of the warriors in the universe.</p>

  <p>During those days, the Demon Night race remained to keep silence.</p>

  <p>Shania had found a way to break the rules of the universe, but none of the Supreme Lords uttered a word about it. On the contrary, the Supreme Lords of the ogre were especially hardworking, and it was said that whenever the ancient sorcerer race attacked, the ogre race would always be the first to rush in.</p>

  <p>The more Zheng came to see the turn of events, the more worried he became. He realized that he didn't know much about the crisis, and he couldn't control anything. 'What can I do to get things under control?' he thought anxiously.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time Zheng was dealing with troubles. In fact, he had faced a lot of obstacles in the past. However, back then he was very clear about where the trouble came from. On top of that, he had good knowledge about how to deal with it. Now, Zheng was clutched by a sense of powerlessness, not because he was afraid of these dangers, but because he could not completely grasp all the information. Nine dragons remained to stay shut, so did Xun. Zheng was unable to discriminate the right from the wrong now.</p>

  <p>The only thing Zheng knew with certainty was that the universe was going to face the invaders. As the leader of the top ten Godly Geniuses, Zheng was obliged to do something to solve this problem.</p>
