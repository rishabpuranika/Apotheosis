<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Wynn hadn't perished completely.</p>

  <p>A True God's soul was particularly tough? even if one was beheaded, they could still think up a way to reconstruct their body.</p>

  <p>But it was a lengthy process. Reconstructing the body and cinnabar field was equal to cultivating all over again.</p>

  <p>The eyes on Wynn's head suddenly shot open and looked up at Master Feng and the group of Supreme Lords on the other side. The originally star-like bright eyes were now completely devoid of any light.</p>

  <p>To fight against the Sacred race, Wynn had led the Celestial Position in planning countless years, only to end up with awful results.</p>

  <p>When Murphy changed the rules in a snap, everyone's hard work and effort turned into nothing.</p>

  <p>Anyone facing such a blow would naturally lose all confidence and Wynn was no exception.</p>

  <p>"You have nothing else to say, do you? Haha! Then go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Mateo grinned viciously. Suddenly, he pulled up Wynn's gray hair and threw the head away. Forming a fist with one hand, he got ready to smash his head apart in a single punch...</p>

  <p>Wynn's head spiraled continuously in the sky. The starry sky, the earth, and the mountains seemed to be rolling images in his eyes as he was thrown.</p>

  <p>Although he looked like a man of old age, he was still relatively young among the True Gods. While lurking in the Evolutionary Universe, he was under his master's protection at all times.</p>

  <p>In his life's final moment, time had slowed immeasurably and the entire Evolutionary Universe left him with a nostalgic heart.</p>

  <p>"Master... I failed..." Wynn muttered weakly.</p>

  <p>As his head circled in the air, a sudden blaze of white light appeared close by. Because his head was spinning quickly, the scene was a blur.</p>

  <p>But after his head spun for another circle, he suddenly saw an unexpected image.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, Xun, and Supreme Lord of Oracle walked out from the crack in space. And in the end, he also saw a long-haired man exuding an extraordinary Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>'Who is that long-haired man?'</p>

  <p>Master Feng thought in wonder.</p>

  <p>When Wynn's head started spinning again, he felt a sudden wave of power grabbing onto it before it was thrown away again. Now with a faster rotation, it was difficult for Wynn to see what was happening around him.</p>

  <p>In an instant, his head was caught and he could see that Supreme Lord of Oracle was beside him, shooting him a wink.</p>

  <p>"Wynn, it's over..." Luo Luo Zheng voiced from behind him.</p>

  <p>"It's over? What's over?" Finding his bearings again, he realized that it was Luo Luo Zheng who caught him and that the long-haired man standing in Mateo's way was the one who grabbed his head and threw it to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What a strong fighting intent! It's the people from the War God Hall!"</p>

  <p>Refined starlight suddenly shone from Wynn's gloomy eyes. While he had no idea of the long-haired man's origins, there was no doubt that he was invited by Luo Luo Zheng and was on his side.</p>

  <p>All the Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe were wide-eyed in shock.</p>

  <p>After Wynn was defeated, the Supreme Lords knew they were at a disadvantage? the war had ended in the Evolutionary Universe's defeat.</p>

  <p>Only a miracle could reverse the situation and the odds of that were too slim.</p>

  <p>When Wynn's head was thrown into the air, many of the Supreme Lords wanted to rush out and snatch it away.</p>

  <p>But even if they did, what would be the use?</p>

  <p>Could they make a difference?</p>

  <p>If the Evolutionary Universe collapsed, everything, from an ant in the Lower World to the countless Supreme Lords in the Upper World would perish? it was only a matter of who would die first. So at that point, everything seemed meaningless.</p>

  <p>There were even some Supreme Lords that decided to retreat. Since resistance had become meaningless, they figured they would take advantage of the last bit of time they had to do something meaningful among their own races. At the very least, they could do something fulfilling during their last days.</p>

  <p>No one was expecting Luo Luo Zheng to appear at that crucial moment.</p>

  <p>A glimmer of hope rose in everyone's hearts when they saw Luo Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord of Oracle suddenly appear.</p>

  <p>But no matter how many miracles the man had created, he was still only a Godly Genius at the world lord level? his overall influence on the entire battle wasn't so great.</p>

  <p>Just then, hope returned when a burly long-haired man walked out behind him.</p>

  <p>"A True God!"</p>

  <p>"A very powerful True God!"</p>

  <p>"A True God? Does Luo Luo Zheng bring him here to help?"</p>

  <p>The moment they saw Blayd, they immediately picked out his unique Mu Ning as that of a True God. And his fighting intent was even more powerful.</p>

  <p>After he appeared, Blayd didn't take any further action, waiting for Luo Zheng's order.</p>

  <p>A calm smile hung on his face and his whole body seemed to glow with a brilliant blue light. Such was the embodiment of his extreme fighting intent!</p>

  <p>Mateo's smile froze.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords behind him felt their bodies stiffen and their thoughts come to a halt.</p>

  <p>A True God's arrival was completely unforeseen.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? This is a dispute between two Holy Beings. If you get involved..." Mateo voiced coldly, his words were similar to Marko's and Pranav's. They all wanted to threaten Blayd with Murphy's name and reputation.</p>

  <p>"If I get involved, will Murphy never let me go? I've heard these words three times today. Don't you have anything new to say?" Blayd yawned and smiled cockily.</p>

  <p>"Three times..." Then, Mateo's eyes flashed with realization. "What happened to Marko and Pranav?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" Blayd cocked his head to the side.</p>

  <p>Never did Mateo think he had to worry about Marko's and Pranav's safety? he had no clue that the two had perished while he was focused on his battle against Wynn.</p>

  <p>Now, Mateo couldn't see a trace of them as he searched with his soul power.</p>

  <p>Though he wanted to leave that to the fact that he couldn't search the entire universe with his soul power? they could have also been too far away, he somehow had a strong feeling that the man in front of him had already killed them.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Mateo roared. Balls of black fog began spreading from his body. In spite of their conflicts, Pranav, Marko, and Mateo had cultivated together in the Murphy Universe. Who would've thought that two of them would disappear in a blink of an eye? The thought made Mateo turn extremely indignant.</p>

  <p>But Blayd only rolled his eyes at Mateo's fury. He turned to Luo Luo Zheng and asked, "This guy is getting noisy and annoying.</p>

  <p>Can I kill him now?"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe were speechless in shock. To think that such a strong person was asking Luo Luo Zheng for permission.</p>

  <p>What was their relationship?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flew back to the top of the cliff and handed Wynn's head to Master Feng. Then, he turned to Blayd and gave the order. "Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" Blayd's laughter resounded as a blazing light burst from beneath his feet, and then he pounced towards Mateo without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>The battle between the True Gods began.</p>

  <p>When Mateo battled Wynn, he had already consumed over half of his life vitality because Wynn launched the Star Tribulation Wave, injuring him severely.</p>

  <p>But even in his best condition, Mateo was no match for Blayd. Given the difference in their strength, it was unlikely that Mateo even had a shot at winning this fight.</p>

  <p>So the moment the fight began, Mateo threw attacks continuously as he retreated, facing Blayd's formidable attacks. He barely had any strength to fight back.</p>

  <p>Up on the cliff, Luo Luo Zheng didn't even bother looking back.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race and the Evolutionary Universe had mixed feelings of hope and worry. The people of the Evolutionary Universe thought that Mateo could have other trump cards to use against Blayd. And the Sacred Supreme Lords hoped that Murphy would protect Mateo long enough for him to turn the tide.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's behavior made it clear that Blayd wasn't his only way to deal with Mateo if he managed to win the fight.</p>

  <p>At the very least, he still had the mysterious woman in blue by his side.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng couldn't clearly see through the strength of these True Gods, Master Evil and Wayne were definitely stronger than Blayd and the woman in blue seemed to be even more powerful than the former.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had no way to turn the situation around other than Murphy coming down to join the battle himself.</p>
