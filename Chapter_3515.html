  <p>
</p>

  <p>The insect man's request gave Abdul a terrible headache.</p>

  <p>Thirty finger-size chunks of soul crystal were equivalent to around 30 million soul pills. Even if the Body-strengthening Jade wasn't considered useful for Souls of Light, it still wasn't cheap and cost around 20 million soul pills.</p>

  <p>Normally, fifty million soul pills weren't that high of a price for the Taiyi Heaven Palace; however, the costs added up considering they had paid five times over the course of six months to a different race each time!</p>

  <p>"My friends, don't you think you've asked too much from us?" Abdul asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>The insect man smirked. Without any warning, he raised his right arm from which a pointed cone flew out, brushing past Abdul's side and hitting the wooden building behind him. The round hole left behind by the cone was not a reassuring sight.</p>

  <p>"This is the price set by Master Ghost Scorpion. Surely you won't dare disobey?"</p>

  <p>This Ghost Scorpion was very notorious in the Myriad Spirits City, often cited as one of the most powerful forces in it.</p>

  <p>"We've already paid a lot to the city guards this year..." Abdul countered.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. Those guards are entirely different from Master Ghost Scorpion. Bah! I'm wasting my time with you Souls of Light!" the insect man spat, raising the sharp cone in his hand.</p>

  <p>There were rules set in the Myriad Spirits City against fighting but the Taiyi Heaven Palace did not have a good foothold in terms of power and influence. It wouldn't be seen as that big of a deal if the Tail Insect race killed a couple of Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he was left with no room for negotiation, Abdul was forced to retreat and return to the wooden building.</p>

  <p>He was able to survive Stage Seventeen with his strength.</p>

  <p>But there were not many people in the Land of Sword Grief, so the Taiyi Heaven Palace saw it fit to send some of them to guard this place every once in a while.</p>

  <p>It was an annoying job. Even though Abdul hated it, he had no choice but to obey what the Taiyi Heaven Palace told him to do.</p>

  <p>He collected the necessary amount of soul crystal and Body-strengthening Jade, reluctantly handing them over to the people of the Tail Insect race.</p>

  <p>Abdul couldn't help but feel extremely depressed when he handed over those 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal!</p>

  <p>That amount could've greatly strengthened his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>It was understandable that he would be greatly unwilling to give them to other races.</p>

  <p>Abdul could only watch as the leader of the Tail Insect race put away the soul crystal and the jade. Master Ghost Scorpion would surely be pleased with them and would naturally give them a small percentage of their earnings.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to leave with their haul, the Tail Insect race turned and spotted the Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples on the other side of the road.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had a bad feeling about this and chose to lead the new disciples to leave. "Wait! Come here, all of you," the insect man screamed.</p>

  <p>Abdul's heart skipped a beat, worrying whether the people of the Tail Insect race would pick on the disciples or something.</p>

  <p>These senior disciples did not dare disobey, choosing to bite the bullet and leading the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace to the entrance of the wooden building.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Tail Insect race tutted. "Tsk, tsk! You brought so many dirty souls from the Lust World again?"</p>

  <p>According to the belief system of the creatures in the Desire World, Souls of Light were dirty beings who continued to corrupt themselves since they did not have the protection of their bodies. They were to be despised according to culture.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was not taken well by the disciples especially since they had recently improved to the Chaotic Source Realm. To be considered dirty by these insects was a great offense. Though they did not refute, the disciples trembled with restrained fury.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge herself threw the insect man a murderous look.</p>

  <p>Their nerve to look down on them was enough for her to consider killing them on the spot.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, in contrast, was much calmer.</p>

  <p>There were always idiots who were ignorant, rude, and arrogant. The correct way to deal with them, as Luo Zheng learned, was to just remain calm.</p>

  <p>Killing them wasn't going to be that much of an issue, but they had to consider the fact that they were newcomers. Causing trouble for the Taiyi Heaven Palace could have unforeseen circumstances later on; thus, Luo Zheng chose to observe rather than act.</p>

  <p>"Each new soul should pay a hundred thousand soul pills, which means you owe us ten million in total. As for the Body-strengthening Jade, you can give me eight pieces since I'm feeling generous," the insect man demanded with a smug smirk.</p>

  <p>Abdul couldn't help but gasp. "What? Is that also an order from Master Ghost Scorpion?"</p>

  <p>The insect man scoffed. "It's my order! Why? Can't I give out my own orders?"</p>

  <p>Just as Abdul was about to open his mouth to argue, a few disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace couldn't help themselves and burst out.</p>

  <p>They had long since known that the Desire World was filled with all sorts of trouble but never to this extent. To see their seniors live in such a way where literal insects bullied them was depressing!</p>

  <p>Any longing for the Desire World disappeared at that moment.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think we'll give you the soul crystal?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't we already pay you a lot?"</p>

  <p>"This is blackmail! Is Myriad Spirits City truly this lawless?!"</p>

  <p>The disciples couldn't help but air out their grievances one by one.</p>

  <p>Abdul and the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief turned pale and were already thinking up of ways to control this situation.</p>

  <p>"Are you questioning me?" the insect man asked. They did not expect such attitudes from the newcomers. Normally, the Tail Insect race got their way owing largely to their influence and connection to Ghost Scorpion. "Let me tell you something." Or rather, he showed them something.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the insect man raised his sharp cone towards the nearest disciple and attacked.</p>

  <p>The force was enough to smash the Soul of Light!</p>

  <p>"Wait."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had come forward, with Elvina following closely behind.</p>

  <p>The sight of these two perplexed the Tail Insect race.</p>

  <p>Humans on the Other Shore were rare but Feng Ge seemed to be a real living creature. They hadn't seen one for so many years.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng confused them since they couldn't see his appearance clearly. Yet, they could deduce that he entered the Other Shore with his physical body! That wasn't supposed to happen!</p>

  <p>However, their strangeness wasn't enough for the Tail Insect race to treat them seriously. The Other Shore was filled with creatures strange, powerful, and strong so this bit of weirdness wasn't as concerning to them as one would think. "What are we supposed to be waiting for?"</p>

  <p>In contrast to the disinterested Tail Insect race, the new disciples, Abdul, and the senior disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were practically beaming with hope at the sight of Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>She had a body! Their only hope now was that she was strong enough to protect them. They still worried a great deal about her since they weren't sure just how powerful she was. Angering a master in the Myriad Spirits City could potentially be bad news to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"I have the pieces of jade," Luo Zheng said, taking out a few and showing them to the members of the Tail Insect race.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because the two had physical bodies that made the Tail Insect race slightly more courteous. "You should have taken them out a long time ago since you had them! Ha!" The insect man let out a hearty laugh and motioned to take the jade away from Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Abdul and the others heaved a sigh of relief. This should be enough to buy peace for some time.</p>

  <p>However, just as the insect man was about to take his earnings, Luo Zheng retracted his hand. "I didn't say I was going to give them to you for free."</p>

  <p>He was obviously teasing and the insect man did not appreciate it one bit.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tilted his head and smirked. "If you want them, pay for them with your life."</p>

  <p>When he said this, a strong wave of killing intent suddenly burst out from Feng Ge. Her entire body trembled with raw power as she grabbed the head of one of the insect men.</p>
