<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2182 Malloy's Worries (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Neither Luo Luo Zheng nor Malloy took the girl's words seriously. Those who heard it were dumbfounded at first, but they had soon dismissed her words as mere nonsense. Maybe it was just a playful prank by the mysterious girl.</p>

  <p>However, Malloy did not dare to offend the girl in the slightest. As such, he wanted to change the topic of the conversation. With a mischievous laugh, he said, "I wonder which branch of the Han Clan you are from?"</p>

  <p>The Han Clan on the Floating Island had a total of three main branches, which were the Spiritual Branch, Heaven Branch, and Earth Branch.</p>

  <p>Those three branches were the core strength of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the three of them together controlled the affairs in the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>When she heard Malloy's question, the girl looked confused. "Which branch? I don't know either."</p>

  <p>"You don't know?" Malloy's face froze, while the other True Gods also revealed looks of surprise. Their faces were again painted with confusion.</p>

  <p>Even people like them, who came from the sub-branches of the Han Clan, were very familiar with the three main branches on the Floating Island. If the girl in front of them really came from the Floating Island, how could she not know? Could they have guessed wrongly? Maybe the girl was from another place.</p>

  <p>Malloy thought for a moment. Afterward, he decided to change his method pf query. "Since you don't know which branch you are from, can you at least tell me your father's name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You want to know who my father is?" The green-clothed girl suddenly understood. With an innocent look on her face, she answered, "Why didn't you ask earlier? My father is? "</p>

  <p>Huff...</p>

  <p>However, before the girl could finish, a strong wind blew in from outside the Heavenly Han House. Along the wind were some particles similar to sand.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, an old man appeared in the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the courtyard was surprised yet again.</p>

  <p>"Grandpa Bruce," the girl smiled when she saw the old man. "Didn't you say you were going to wait for me outside?"</p>

  <p>Bruce looked at the girl and shook his head. Then, he turned to look at Malloy and asked coldly, "Are you the leader of the Heavenly Han House? As a member of a sub-branch of the Han Clan, don't you know that some questions cannot be randomly asked?"</p>

  <p>As the old man bluntly questioned him, Malloy's expression was filled with dissatisfaction. Although he knew that the young lady was part of the Han Clan, he didn't know which branch she was from and he needed to figure out. Nonetheless, he didn't want to offend the young lady. Just as he was about to open his mouth to explain, he saw the old man gently lift up the hem of his robe. A beautiful green sword hung on his waist. It was carved with emerald. The surface of the sword was full of hollows, and it was very exquisite.</p>

  <p>When Malloy saw the small green sword, his expression suddenly changed. His face was full of reverence. Then, he kneeled down on one knee as he cupped his fists. In a respectful tone, he said, "I'm Malloy Han, from the 13th sub-branch of the Han Clan. Welcome to the Heavenly Han House."</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Malloy who suddenly became respectful. Seth, Zane and the other members of the Han Clan also recognized the sword. They also dropped to one knee to kowtow to the old man.</p>

  <p>"I'm Zane Han, from the 9th sub-branch of the Han Clan. Welcome to the Heavenly Han House."</p>

  <p>"I'm Seth Han, from the 3rd sub-branch of the Han Clan. Welcome to the Heavenly Han House."</p>

  <p>All the disciples with the surname Han kneeled on the ground.</p>

  <p>Every one of them immediately showed respect to the old man who just arrived.</p>

  <p>As for those who were not from the Han Clan, including the True Gods and proving godly warriors, they were completely clueless as to what had happened.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng faintly glanced at the small green sword. He thought that the recent changes in the attitude of those from the Han Clan were most likely because of the small green sword and not because of the old man.</p>

  <p>His guess was not wrong. The sword indeed was the reason for their sudden respect.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan's Floating Island was like a huge kingdom. Any disciples that came from the Floating Island would have a much higher status than the disciples of Han Clan's sub-branches in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>However, the disciples on the Han Clan's Floating Island also had a huge difference in status. A hierarchy similar to a caste system was followed in the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>If the Floating Island was like a kingdom, then the Han Clan's Holy Emperor was naturally the king.</p>

  <p>However, the presence of the Holy Emperor was well hidden. He would only appear once every tens of thousands of years. Even some of his relatives had barely seen him. Although some of the descendants of the Han Clan had the blood of the Holy Emperor, they might not be able to meet the Holy Emperor for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>However, there were a few people from the Han Clan who had the qualifications to see the Holy Emperor. Such people had extremely special statuses.</p>

  <p>Perhaps such people didn't have high positions in the Han Clan, nor did they even take on any jobs. However, such people were not easily ignored. Their existences and statuses were extraordinary. Each of them had a small green sword on them.</p>

  <p>The small green sword on the old man meant that either the old man or the girl was someone close to the Holy Emperor. It was a symbol of status and evidence that they could meet the Holy Emperor.</p>

  <p>As such, the people from the Han Clan did not salute the old man.</p>

  <p>Instead, their respect was targeted towards the little green sword that hung on the old man's waist.</p>

  <p>Bruce gave them a nod as a faint reply and didn't pay any more attention to them. He turned his head to look at his young lady. In a gentle yet firm tone, he said, "Miss, you've said that if your identity is revealed, you must go home with me. So don't? "</p>
