<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 690 Cheating (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just as these people were discussing Luo Zheng and the current situation of the test, the middle-aged cultivator glanced at the Picture Slab and remarked,</p>

  <p>"Now we enter the fourth round of attack."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the announcement, Michael and Xiao immediately shifted their gaze at the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>During the third round of defense, it was quite astonishing how Luo Zheng managed to climb into the leaderboards and take the lead in killing black turtles. At the same time, Michael, along with everyone else, was checking how Owen was doing, a cultivator at the consummation of Illuminating Soul Realm, thus missing the scene of Lily, the sword spirit, killing black turtles.</p>

  <p>Taking what the middle-aged cultivator said into consideration, Michael and Xiao were burning with curiosity. They could easily tell at a glance that Zheng's sword spirit was peculiar. But why? What had made it so special?</p>

  <p>In their minds, they only thought that Zheng's sword spirit was too beautiful to be true. With a set of elongated ears, it appeared as if the sword spirit was somewhat inhuman. No one had any clue as to which race it could be classified into because it had been gifted with such a flawless physique and quality.</p>

  <p>The attacks in the magic array were steadily becoming much, much more vicious.</p>

  <p>Not a single one of the cultivators had been defeated in the span of the first round of battle against the spiders with three eyes as well as the second round of battle with the ogres holding spears, and there wasn't even a single pagoda that got destroyed as well.</p>

  <p>But the moment the third round of attack arrived, seven of the cultivators' pagodas had already gotten damaged by the black turtles. And the state of affairs just got worse as one by one, the competitors were getting eliminated. Only a few of them would survive during the fourth round of attack.</p>

  <p>When the bell started tolling, Luo Zheng heard a shrieking noise coming from above him and looked up to check what was happening.</p>

  <p>"What is that? Does that mean the fourth round of attack is going to come from up above?"</p>

  <p>Without a warning, a dark cloud full of creatures swarmed toward Luo Zheng from the sky.</p>

  <p>Not until the dark cloud was already floating right in front of Zheng's face was he able to realize that it was actually a large group of crow zombies.</p>

  <p>These crow zombies consumed carcasses for sustenance, causing their beaks to get covered with toxic ptomaine at all times. Even the bladder located under their beaks stood the test of time, eventually adapting and evolving to store toxins. Crow zombies had been notable for their quick attacks and for being unforgiving creatures. If you finished off one of their kind, the rest would definitely come for revenge to besiege the enemy. They were the creatures whom cultivators greatly despised.</p>

  <p>"These fearsome crow zombies are flying all over the place, moving much swifter than the armed ogres ever did! I guess it would be safe to say only a handful would be able to make it through this round!"</p>

  <p>The instant the archers protecting Zheng's tower unleashed a flurry of their arrows, Luo Zheng, along with his sword spirit, Lily, hightailed toward the sky straight away.</p>

  <p>"I'm gonna put an end to every single one of you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was surrounded by his consummate sword intent, slashing right through all of the crow zombies which were three meters away from him in all directions with ease, basically turning them all into mincemeat. The man went berserk through the lot, and every move he made, the lifeless bodies of crow zombies went down one by one like rain drops. Before they could even make it to the ground, all of the bodies transformed into blinding specks of light.</p>

  <p>For this assault phase, Luo Zheng exhausted about half of his power, or else, he couldn't have possibly lasted that long.</p>

  <p>These wretched crow zombies let out a series of grating caws.</p>

  <p>They dove in with reckless abandon, spraying their reserves of toxin all over Luo Zheng while thronging him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been completely enveloped by a shroud of dark green toxic gas.</p>

  <p>If any other person were to inhale those toxins, they would most certainly fall dead on the spot. But it was quite a different case when it came to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Possessing a body of spiritual weapon which was immune to the toxins, he was simply left completely unscathed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't even bat an eye even though he got surrounded by lethal fumes, much less Lily. She actually laid waste to more crow zombies than Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>She gracefully soared through the skies much like a little fairy, and no one had a ghost of a chance of stopping her. Lily waved her great black sword, which moved so swiftly that it appeared as though it was a flower of death.</p>

  <p>Wherever the flower bloomed, pieces of crow zombie plummeted. This helped Zheng's points displayed on the tower side to increase.</p>

  <p>"Sixty seconds for the fourth round of attack to be fought off!" Luo Zheng reckoned how much time they had spent fighting and shifted his gaze into the distance, "That's..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flew over to finish off those crow zombies and looked even farther. The grassland, which had been constructed using magic array, was uneven and a bit bumpy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng peered at a distance and made out the figure of one cultivator killing crow zombies in another grassland.</p>

  <p>However, it looked like the man was having a hard time dealing with them.</p>

  <p>Those vile creatures flocked him from all sides and spewed out huge amounts of toxic gas, causing the pitiful man to keel over out of fear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng examined the state of his own tower. Given that he had already cleared out the group of crow zombies which had been roaming around it, he was positive that the tower wouldn't be in any real danger, at least until the next round of attack arrived.</p>

  <p>The rules stated that the more crow zombies you defeated, the more points you were going to receive. But did it say anything regarding killing off the other participants' crow zombies?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng giggled in excitement and hurriedly moved over to another area.</p>
