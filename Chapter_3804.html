<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3804 On The Eternal Scroll Painting </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With a loud sizzle, a terrifying flame suddenly rose from Claire's slender body, burning her to ashes. .</p>

  <p>The scarlet flames floating in the white ball was her real body.</p>

  <p>The moment she turned into a ball of flames, a cold voice rang out yet again. "Grandmaster of Heaven, I advise you to give up."</p>

  <p>"Just a word from you and you expect me to give up?" The Grandmaster of Heaven remained stoic. "Even if the Eye Spirit came to me in person, he has no right to force me to give up."</p>

  <p>"If the Eye Spirit were to come to you in person, he wouldn't stop until he killed you," Claire added.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race had fought quite fiercely both openly and secretly. The Nihility race hadn't declined, but had instead become stronger with each passing day. But overall, the Element Spirit race still held an absolute advantage.</p>

  <p>If the Element Spirit race really wanted to fight the Nihility race to death, they would most likely find themselves in a situation similar to what the human race had been in back then.</p>

  <p>The human race had once grown so powerful that they had become a threat to the Element Spirit race. But although the Element Spirit race had suffered a heavy blow, they had finally won. They had eliminated most of the humans, and trapped the outstanding human heroes on Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Nihility race hadn't existed at the time. If it had, the Element Spirit race wouldn't have dared attack the human race at such great cost. After all, the fight between any of the two races would work as an advantage of the third one. No one would have dared do such a stupid thing.</p>

  <p>This situation was somewhat similar to that of the past. The sudden rise of the Nihility race had already threatened the status of the Element Spirit race. If the Element Spirit race fought despite the risk of suffering heavy blows, they might succeed in eliminating the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>There was no third great force that would profit from their fight. The Other Shore races that still stuck to the Finale Way weren't a threat in any way.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had a psychological advantage over the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>But the Grandmaster of Heaven was mighty.</p>

  <p>He had led the Nihility race from strength to strength.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven remained stoic in the face of these threats. He replied calmly, "Then let's fight till death."</p>

  <p>There was grit and determination in the simple reply.</p>

  <p>Claire didn't say anything. The flames in the white ball trembled but she had already left.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was also a very smart man. Luo Zheng's words made it clear that he believed in the Finale Way, and there was no question of changing his mind.</p>

  <p>It would be meaningless for the Grandmaster of Heaven to stay here and persuade Luo Zheng to join the Nihility race. He had to find another way.</p>

  <p>"Some ideas will change with time," the Grandmaster of Heaven said slowly and then dived into the red ball.</p>

  <p>The three blood-red balls flew towards another direction.</p>

  <p>Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven had left, but the shock that they had caused still lingered.</p>

  <p>The final exchange between the powerful warriors of the two races had shocked the Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>Were the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race preparing to fight to death in order to win Luo Zheng over?</p>

  <p>It was a well-known fact that the two biggest races on the Other Shore had been fighting openly and secretly for nearly four hundred chaotic eras. But both sides were scrupulous and had never come to a stage where they had to fight to death.</p>

  <p>And now their confrontation had escalated just because of a human boy who hadn't even reached the Eternal Realm yet?</p>

  <p>What did it mean?</p>

  <p>It probably meant that there was a reason why they thought Luo Zheng was worthy enough that they needed to fight until death.</p>

  <p>What was the reason though?</p>

  <p>The collective interest of the Other Shore creatures in Luo Zheng was piqued.</p>

  <p>Even Pearce, Auden, and the others from the Taiyi Heaven Palace were confused.</p>

  <p>They knew that Luo Zheng was important to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but not to the point that two races were willing to fight for him!</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, what's going on?" Luo Zheng asked, confused and helpless.</p>

  <p>The attitude that these two great races held towards him was beyond Luo Zheng's comprehension. He wanted an answer from the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had been silent from the very beginning. He seemed to want to avoid the Grandmaster of Heaven for some reason.</p>

  <p>And now that the Grandmaster of Heaven had left, the Primeval Lord of Heaven returned to normal. He said slowly, as if he was mulling over his words, "Perhaps it's because of the eighteen imprints you've obtained."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures of Stage Thirty-two didn't know that Luo Zheng had obtained eighteen imprints, but the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire probably knew about it.</p>

  <p>"Because of these imprints?" Luo Zheng said, even more confused. It wasn't a very convincing reason.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, the more imprints one has, the better they could handle everything in the Eternal Scroll Painting. But back then, it was unclear whether the eighteen imprints would cause other problems. Now that so many years have passed, many things might have happened that I do not know about."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven knew a lot about the world but he had been trapped on Stage Thirty-three for a long time. He didn't know anything about what had transpired in the past many chaotic eras. According to him, the problem was still in the eighteen imprints.</p>

  <p>Everyone was absorbed in guesswork when the edge of the scroll painting in the sky suddenly became coated in a layer of gold.</p>

  <p>The scroll painting hanging in the sky of the Grand Plain Stage revealed many different colors which slowly took shape and turned into silhouettes of different Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A circle soon appeared in the Eternal Scroll Painting. It rotated slowly and before long, a long colorful ribbon had emerged from it. It twisted and turned into a huge vortex, filling the entire Eternal Scroll Painting. The scene presented was magnificently eye-catching.</p>

  <p>"Vortex!"</p>

  <p>Of late, whenever Luo Zheng saw a vortex, he could not help but think of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is connecting to some part of the Abstruse Energy World," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, confirming his thoughts.</p>

  <p>As the vortex continued to fluctuate, the silhouettes that had shown up began to line up in an orderly fashion within the vortex.</p>

  <p>The vortex was made up of hundreds of circles of different sizes. The silhouette of the Other Shore creature that was in the innermost circle looked like a single ball.</p>

  <p>This ball was likely a member of the Nihility race or the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once mentioned that the Eye Spirit of the Element Spirit race was ranked first in the Eternal Scroll Painting. This ball was probably the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>A spider like creature was ranked second. The Primeval Lord of Heaven explained to Luo Zheng that it was a spider spirit from the Star Spider Civilization in the 96th round of chaos. Its silhouette had been left on the Eternal Scroll Painting, but its real body had already perished on Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>"Can such a powerful existence that ranked second in the Eternal Scroll Painting die in Stage Thirty-three?" Luo Zheng was surprised.</p>

  <p>"The closer one is to the top ranks in the Eternal Scroll Painting, the more outstanding blood power one will be able to obtain. But these rankings don't represent their full strength," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. "The Grandmaster of Heaven never managed to enter the first four circles, but he still became the leader of the Nihility race."</p>
