<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once the thunderbolts made their way into the Cold Prison, they would take another form.</p>

  <p>That form would allow the bald giant to kill the Magical Thunder Slaves quite easily.</p>

  <p>But they reacted surprisingly fast, moving quickly and nimbly like eels!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>With the thunderous bangs, the Magical Thunder Slaves slithered through the gaps between the giant's hands and ran off in all directions.</p>

  <p>The giant stretched and grabbed over and over, attempting to catch them again, but they kept escaping before he even knew it.</p>

  <p>In less than thirty seconds, some of the Five-Element Slaves had died and some had successfully fled. Only Luo Zheng, Phoenix and Li Bianxue were left beside the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>"Should we... leave too?"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue asked, her voice trembling.</p>

  <p>She knew escape was an almost unreasonable hope; that pair of hands would not allow them to leave so easily. But even now, she still held a glimmer of hope in her heart...</p>

  <p>When she looked at Luo Zheng, he was her rope hanging from above that she could climb to safety if things got too bad.</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng said firmly, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Phoenix and Li Bianxue could not see it, but Luo Zheng saw clearly that the bald giant stared at him with a faint smile spreading across his face.</p>

  <p>He fixed his gaze on him like a tiger stalking its prey, ready to pounce and feast on him.</p>

  <p>From this distance, escape was impossible.</p>

  <p>The only sliver of hope he had was the previous hint!</p>

  <p>He and the bald giant had a common enemy, and they both stood on the same side of this.</p>

  <p>Fleeing now would only incite an attack from the bald giant.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The light dots in the Cold Prison grew restless once more. The bald giant lifted his hands and slapped at the three of them again.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue's long hair blew from the force of the slap and she couldn't help but scream.</p>

  <p>She had had a lot of training experience on the Other Shore, but she hadn't come face to face with any real serious difficulty or danger. She was thus left ill-prepared for the grave life and death situation they now found themselves in.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Luo Zheng and Phoenix were much calmer.</p>

  <p>Phoenix had become the leader of the Divine Lair after she had been through countless bloody battles and come out victorious. This was her strength. To this day, she regarded life and death as unimportant details and Luo Zheng shared this view after similar experiences.</p>

  <p>He had always had an inkling that the bald giant was not stupid. If he still longed for freedom, they were his best shot at getting it!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The two enormous hands finally came to a halt two or three feet above the Divine Fire Shield, and then slowly withdrew towards the inside of the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue stopped screaming and seemed to gasp for breath.</p>

  <p>Of course, her soul did not need to breathe. It was simply an expression of relief after all the nervousness that had overtaken her.</p>

  <p>"Woo... Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Soon, rhythmic sounds could be heard from the Cold Prison, as if many people were singing together.</p>

  <p>"Help me decipher it," Luo Zheng said to the green figure.</p>

  <p>After the green figure had moved from the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to the Civilization Artifact, it had been sitting there, paying close attention to Luo Zheng's every move. If Luo Zheng gave the order, it would activate the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization immediately.</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly began deciphering the content and transmitted it directly to Luo Zheng's mind. "He is asking if you are enemies of the Element Spirit race," said the green figure.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly. This question proved that his strategy had worked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had wanted the bald giant to understand that he was on his side.</p>

  <p>The new issue was how to answer the giant's question.</p>

  <p>As a creature from the chaos, even if he knew how to express himself, he still couldn't actually make the correct sounds. The bald giant even could not understand the similar sounds. He had tried this before and failed...</p>

  <p>"Dong, dong!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hesitated in his response and the giant uncurled a finger from the depths of the Cold Prison and hit the surface of the ice.</p>

  <p>A rhythmic sound was heard again, exactly the same as before.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, he's asking us a question, right?" Phoenix asked, noticing the giant in the Cold Prison was getting a little impatient.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he asked if we're enemies of the Element Spirit race," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"But how do we answer him?" Phoenix asked helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to figure that out," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue, who had been extremely nervous, suddenly blurted out, "The souls in the Soul City are not creatures from outside the chaos, but they are capable of making the sounds of reading Sanskrit words!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes suddenly lit up at this revelation. "Yes! Many souls make sounds at the same time that mix together..."</p>

  <p>The pronunciation of the Sanskrit words was not made of a single syllable.</p>

  <p>When the bald giant spoke, it was as if dozens of people spoke and sang at the same time.</p>

  <p>Although the green figure had taught Luo Zheng the proper pronunciation, he would be unable to create such a complex sound alone. If there were dozens of people making sounds together, it could be possible.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng speedily conveyed this idea to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was thinking this himself. Being very intelligent, he reacted immediately at Luo Zheng's suggestion.</p>

  <p>If there were enough people together to make the correct sounds and combine them together, they could create the same effect as the bald giant!</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven quickly gathered the elites of the human race in the Civilization Artifact. At the same time, he let the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization disassemble the pronunciation of the Sanskrit words. Every piece of pronunciation that contained multiple sounds was disassembled into single syllables, and each elite of the human race was responsible for uttering one single syllable.</p>

  <p>"Dong, dong, dong!"</p>

  <p>The bald giant hit the ice surface with his thick finger again, splashing the debris of ice in all directions.</p>

  <p>He was growing increasingly impatient. He asked the question a third time, and the smile on his face had disappeared entirely.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue and Phoenix looked at Luo Zheng simultaneously, hoping he would come up with a solution...</p>

  <p>Just then, more than thirty heads suddenly appeared above Luo Zheng's head. The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Houyi and the others uttered words as if they sang together. "Yes, the Element Spirit race is my enemy!"</p>

  <p>The bald giant obviously hadn't expected Luo Zheng to answer in this way. After a moment of amazement, a smile returned to his face. "Is the Element Spirit race the ruler of this world?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Using the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, the green figure deciphered the sentence and conveyed its meaning to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The ruler of this world? No. They are nothing but cowards in this world,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, the Element Spirit Civilization's pursuit of the Purge Way was a helpless compromise to make the world peaceful. If one wanted to truly solve the crisis of chaos, they would have to rely on the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the pursuit of the Purge Way was a coward's venture.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished speaking, the green figure once again translated the words into complex syllables, and then disassembled them for the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others to sing together and make the composite sound.</p>

  <p>Communicating in this way was very inconvenient, but at least it could help Luo Zheng communicate with the giant.</p>

  <p>However, Fuxi, Houyi and the others rolled their eyes as they sang this strange song. This task had clearly left them in a bad mood and they felt helpless in having to do it.</p>
