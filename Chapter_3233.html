  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng tried to destroy the smoke wall, several Champion Fish rushed towards him secretly.</p>

  <p>They had begun to open their mouths, ready to bite into Luo Zheng's body when a small sword pierced through them, cutting all of them into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, Luo Zheng," Ling Shuang warned, concerned.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was keeping an eye on Luo Zheng's surroundings while he concentrated on destroying the wall.</p>

  <p>"This wall is too strong. It's too difficult to destroy," Luo Zheng said, frowning.</p>

  <p>They could neither break through the wall, nor leave the Other Shore. A constant stream of Champion Fish kept emerging from the altars. This was a dead end for the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish could not hurt Luo Zheng but the other disciples were in great trouble.</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish shot out of the altars from all directions and charged at the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race seemed to have used some special method that caused the Champion Fish to ignore them.</p>

  <p>One of the weaker disciples was slower than the others in his escape and soon found himself surrounded by a large group of Champion Fish. Before he could react, the malicious creatures had torn his Soul of Light apart. He screamed in pain, desperate for relief, as his soul was mercilessly ripped into shreds. But his scream only lasted three seconds before the Champion Fish ate up his soul.</p>

  <p>As more and more disciples met the same fate, their pathetic screams echoed across the place from time to time. It was like witnessing the worst kind of hell on earth as the Champion Fish devoured the Souls of Light of the poor disciples.</p>

  <p>Quite a few elites of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were present and all of them, including Milo, could protect only themselves.</p>

  <p>"There's no point in going on like this," Luo Zheng muttered, as the number of Champion Fish swelled. He climbed onto an altar and roared, raising his voice through his soul power, "All disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace!</p>

  <p>Please stay close to me!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace heeded his words and began to move towards him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been charging forward at the front, the rest following him in a loose formation. At his summons, the elite disciples gathered together tightly, trying to keep as close to him as possible.</p>

  <p>The weaker disciples were at the center, surrounded and protected by the others, while the Indigo Souls who were capable of fighting the Champion Fish remained in the outer circle.</p>

  <p>They stayed close to each other, their backs against the edges of the altars.</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish kept coming at them with a ferocity that was unmatched. But the moment they made it near the crowd, the disciples' joint attacks succeeded in killing them.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic! Stand your ground!"</p>

  <p>"We have the power to fight against these fish!"</p>

  <p>"Let's fight the Bearing race to death since they didn't allow us to leave!"</p>

  <p>Now that they were out of danger, the elite disciples calmed down quickly and began to encourage their companions. They soon managed to erase their fears and regain their confidence to fight.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Let me help you!" a man shouted, jumping onto the altar that Luo Zheng was standing on.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng recognized the man's voice. Konnor.</p>

  <p>"Konnor? I didn't know you were here!" Luo Zheng said, surprised.</p>

  <p>"I only came here as a spectator. I didn't expect things to take such a turn,"</p>

  <p>Konnor grumbled.</p>

  <p>Most disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had come here out of curiosity. It was possible that some of them wanted to acquire the soul crystal of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had neither the time nor the mood to listen to Konnor's complaints.</p>

  <p>Now that so many disciples had gathered around him, he hoped that they could think up a way to destroy the smoke wall. He said, "This wall of smoke is proving difficult to destroy. If any of you have an idea of how to deal with it, please come and have a try!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had tried all the tricks in his book until a few moments ago. His Mind Sword was sharp and powerful but he hadn't been able to make a single dent in the wall.</p>

  <p>These elite disciples came from different mountains in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and they all cultivated different types of theurgies. Luo Zheng hoped that some of them might have practiced powerful soul theurgies that could destroy the wall.</p>

  <p>Saying thus, Luo Zheng jumped off the altar and made his way to the outer circle to help the other elite disciples kill the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>A man flew out of the crowd and came to stand on the altar.</p>

  <p>"It's Efrain!"</p>

  <p>"The best of talents from the Azure Mountain!"</p>

  <p>"His power is on par with Milo's, and his cultivation base is even higher than Milo's!"</p>

  <p>As the crowd hissed with excitement and gazed up at him in awe, purple flames began to appear on the surface of Efrain's soul. His Soul of Light seemed to be burning. He slapped both hands onto the wall, causing the peculiar purple flames to climb the wall, lapping fiercely against it.</p>

  <p>This purple flame was a soul skill unique to the Azure Mountain. Disciples could rarely grasp it.</p>

  <p>Fiery as the purple flames were, they had almost no effect on the wall. They just paled slightly in color. There was no sign of any substantial damage at all.</p>

  <p>Efrain tried a number of times but when he saw that he was making no difference, he shook his head helplessly and jumped off the altar. "I can't destroy this wall," he said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Let me try!"</p>

  <p>"And me!"</p>

  <p>The elite disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace took turns to try their luck with the wall, displaying their unique skills in the process.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng killed the Champion Fish as they charged at him, but he also had an eye on what was going on behind him. He couldn't help but feel disappointed at the various soul theurgies that his companions were using.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace had a serious disadvantage. It was one of the three orthodox forces of the human race, but it was in fact a union of a number of clans. The seven mountains were separated from each other and each had their own set of systems. They were not merged together as one whole.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race both consisted only of members from the same race, who shared bloodlines with each other. They had had the advantage of strong cohesion on many occasions before? an advantage that the Taiyi Heaven Palace would never be able to acquire.</p>

  <p>The elite disciples who had the confidence to destroy the wall took turns trying their luck with the wall. But every single one of them ended up failing.</p>

  <p>"We can't break this wall!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>"We can't just sit around trapped in this place, right?"</p>

  <p>As they spiraled into desperate discussions, the Champion Fish continued to emerge from the altars and rain down on them.</p>

  <p>They had gathered all their strength and killed a number of Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>But their soul power was limited. They could still consume soul pills to replenish their power, but they would eventually use up all of the pills if they couldn't manage to find a way out.</p>

  <p>They would all die even if they were to guard themselves while staying put.</p>

  <p>"Why don't we try to destroy the altars instead?" someone piped up suddenly.</p>

  <p>The altars that the Bearing race had summoned had fully materialized by now. Ling Shuang and a few others stepped gingerly onto some of them. If any Champion Fish were to fly out of the altars, they could immediately kill them from where they stood.</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred altars here. If they could destroy all of them, they might still have a chance of surviving.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's that easy," Ling Shuang said skeptically.</p>

  <p>The Necklace of Mystic Soul hanging on her chest flashed and a soul sword that had been floating beside, shot fiercely towards an altar.</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>But the small sword merely bounced away with a clanging sound.</p>

  <p>These altars were almost as strong as the temples, which was why they were unable to break them.</p>

  <p>A few other disciples tried to have a go after Ling Shuang, but ended up with the same result.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned at this disappointing sight, wondering what else they could do.</p>

  <p>If his Soul of Light could get out of the Other Shore and he then returned with his physical body, he believed that he could destroy these altars.</p>

  <p>But if he could get out of the Other Shore, it meant that the others could do just the same. This would no longer be a predicament to them.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish in the distance were swirling and spiraling upwards into the air, forming a protecting layer around a Soul of Light. Seamus.</p>

  <p>"You're still under the illusion that you have a chance of survival, aren't you?" Seamus said, smiling. "Let me break the illusion for you and turn you into feed for these Champion Fish!"</p>

  <p>He had barely finished talking when a faint golden light flashed across the mirrors on all the altars. The Champion Fish emerging from the mirrors grew several times in size.</p>
