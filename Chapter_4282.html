<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The thunderous noise lasted for three days and three nights before it finally stopped.</p>

  <p>The entire chaos temporarily returned to a state of tranquility. Some of the creatures in the Source World began to regain their senses of hearing.</p>

  <p>Even though the terrible shock waves already disappeared, the people did not feel relieved. Instead, they became even more worried.</p>

  <p>Some of them began to leaf through the ancient books. They were trying to predict what would happen next.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, someone in the Bloom Divine Province found a relevant passage.</p>

  <p>An old man opened an ancient book with his hands trembling with fear and anxiety.</p>

  <p>This ancient book was written long ago by an elder of his race. It talked about what would happen should the end come.</p>

  <p>"The last thunder will destroy everything with its sound. However, the six sages will be protected by a bright and dazzling light."</p>

  <p>"Those six sages refer to the six Chaos Ancient Gods," murmured one of his companions.</p>

  <p>"So six lucky warriors will be selected in the Source World," another one chimed in.</p>

  <p>To be chosen as one of the Chaos Ancient Gods, there were two conditions that must be satisfied. First, the person must possess enormous amounts of strength. At the very least, they must be at the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The second one would be sheer luck.</p>

  <p>Knowing this secret, the warriors at the Holy Soul Realm and the Eternal Realm had high hopes that they could be one of the chosen Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>If they were selected, they were basically granted a special ticket to the next round of chaos.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, everyone heard a buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>A beam of light suddenly appeared in the Source World. It headed straight for the hall the Evil God built.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the second floor of the hall, several cultivators of the Holy Soul Realm and the Eternal Realm were greedily absorbing the bloodline powers.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at these people impassively. He appeared extremely generous. But in actuality, he felt thoroughly disgusted of them.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he would need their help. All he could do for now was patiently satisfy their greed.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Something streaked past them from above.</p>

  <p>The beam of light pierced through the black hall and enshrouded one of the cultivators of the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The cultivator was still digesting the bloodline power he had just absorbed. He opened his eyes and saw the light enveloping his entire body. Naturally, he was awestruck for a few moments. Suddenly, he realized that he was chosen to be a Chaos Ancient God and master a truth.</p>

  <p>He was so happy that he jumped up from his meditating position earlier.</p>

  <p>"Is he the one chosen to be a Chaos Ancient God?" one of the cultivators whispered to his fellow cultivator.</p>

  <p>"Even if we don't survive the end, he will still make it to the next chaotic era with such ease," murmured another.</p>

  <p>"What a stroke of luck! He doesn't possess that much strength. Why is he chosen? It's unfair!" a fierce warrior of the Holy Soul Realm protested.</p>

  <p>Another warrior felt envious. "Why couldn't it be me?"</p>

  <p>All the warriors in this hall had been invited here to merge with the bloodline powers. Earlier, they were quite happy and satisfied as they were able to gather much power. But when they saw that one of them was chosen as a Chaos Ancient God, they felt terribly envious and depressed.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, this beam of light also reminded them that there would be six chosen Chaos Ancient Gods. This meant that they still had a chance.</p>

  <p>The chosen warrior was extremely excited. Anyone who was granted a sure ticket to the next chaotic era would obviously feel overjoyed.</p>

  <p>But before long, he saw a black figure approaching him. It reached out and grabbed him by his neck.</p>

  <p>The black figure was none other than the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Realm warrior was a little flustered. He had no idea why the Evil God attacked him. "What... What are you doing?" he asked as he trembled with fear.</p>

  <p>"What part of this do you not understand? This is the last chaotic era. If I lose, there won't be a next chaotic era. What's the use of choosing the next Chaos Ancient Gods?" The Evil God's expression was cold and apathetic.</p>

  <p>"But... But... I was chosen..." the Holy Soul Realm warrior stammered as he didn't know what else to say.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's hand flashed with a black light. In the blink of an eye, the warrior's body turned into colorful steam that scattered in every direction.</p>

  <p>When they saw this scene unfold right in front of them, all the other warriors were frightened. The Evil God slayed the warrior in such a way they had never seen before.</p>

  <p>Even if what he said was true, this was totally uncalled for. Whether or not there would be a next round of chaos, there was no need to kill anyone so recklessly.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, they realized that the seemingly generous Evil God was never a good person in the first place.</p>

  <p>A short while ago, they were looking forward to being chosen as the Chaos Ancient Gods. But now, they changed their minds. They were afraid that the light would envelope them, which in turn, would prompt the Evil God to kill them.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Once again, someone had been chosen.</p>

  <p>The second beam of light appeared.</p>

  <p>It shot directly into the primitive land and fell upon the Pear Hill. It landed on Fuxi who was currently standing on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess and the others saw this, they were slightly astounded. After a second, they smiled as they understood why he was chosen.</p>

  <p>In this current chaotic era, Fuxi had never given up on achieving the Finale Way. Therefore, it was not surprising that he was chosen as a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>However, Fuxi smiled bitterly. "I've worked so hard for so long. But in the end, I still can't live up to the expectations of the human race. Is this supposed to be a compensation for me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, this kind of compensation can never be fulfilled," joked the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they were well-aware that this was the last chaotic era and there would be no next one after this.</p>

  <p>Afterward, came the third, fourth, fifth, sixth beams of light.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they all landed in the black hall of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God killed three Holy Soul Realm cultivators and one Eternal Realm cultivator on the spot. Everyone watching the massacre was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>After the Chaos Ancient Gods were chosen, the chaos began to clean up itself.</p>

  <p>This was done to ensure that all living beings within the chaos would be annihilated. However, there were no living beings within the chaos due to the downgrading. Like the last thunder, this round of purging had no effect.</p>

  <p>Three days passed since that fateful day.</p>

  <p>There were lots of intricate cracks that suddenly appeared on the inner wall of the chaos.</p>

  <p>These cracks intertwined with each other and formed a huge circular array. Little by little, a needle appeared in the center of the array.</p>

  <p>When the needle first emerged, it was only the size of an embroidery needle. It was particularly tiny compared to the vast Source World.</p>

  <p>However, the needle continued to extend outwards.</p>

  <p>At first, it was only a one-inch protrusion. Then, it extended from ten inches to a hundred inches.</p>

  <p>After a while, it became ten feet long. Then from a hundred feet, it reached a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>From that, it continued to grow until it extended up to ten million feet!</p>

  <p>The needle grew not only in length, but also in its diameter. It continued to expand further. In just an hour, it had already expanded into a massive object.</p>

  <p>As soon as the needle appeared, the sentry Evil God and Zheng immediately noticed it.</p>

  <p>An idea flashed through their minds almost at the same time. Who would be the first target of this needle?</p>

  <p>Usually, there was only one primitive land in a chaotic era. But in this round of chaos, there were three. Which of those primitive lands would the needle attack first?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was something happening in the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>The downgrader was floating in mid-air.</p>

  <p>There was a complicated array plate right in front of him. This was exactly the same as the array that hatched the needle.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King said, "The structure of the secondary world is quite exquisite. The hourglass is the one controlling the restart time. After that, the needle will end everything and signal the beginning of the next chaos.</p>

  <p>I applaud you!"</p>

  <p>It was the downgrader who invented the method of creating secondary worlds. In order to downgrade the main world, he designed the aforementioned method in advance. He did this to deceive the Snake Spirit King and trick the Four Spirits Sect into building one secondary world after another.</p>

  <p>This must seem shameful to the Snake Spirit King. Nonetheless, he had to flatter the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"Humph! This method of the Lower Extreme World is awfully insignificant!" the downgrader exclaimed as he fiddled with the array plate.</p>

  <p>The needle had already become incredibly massive. It changed its direction constantly and continued to grow at an even faster rate.</p>

  <p>The sentry Evil God was watching all this. Suddenly, his expression became serious.</p>

  <p>He confirmed that the needle was heading straight for the Source World.</p>
