<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Between the first and the sixth lines, Zheng hadn't encountered very many Truth Boats.</p>

  <p>After the sixth line however, things began to change and there were an increasing number of boats floating out on the Sea of Truth. As they reached the ninth line, Zheng had a hard time counting the boats because there were suddenly so many.</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many people here in the ninth line?" Of course, Zheng couldn't help but feel surprised at the sight of the numerous boats floating on the sea.</p>

  <p>Dorothy giggled and replied, "When compared to the ninth line, the first eight are nothing. Upon reaching here, most people will stop for quite some time and well-needed rest. Take a look at what they are doing."</p>

  <p>Zheng stared out at the quietly floating Truth Boats with more intent this time, as well as the mediating Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they were doing exactly the same thing that Zheng had planned to do— they were staying in the ninth line in order to be baptized by the Sea of Truth, making their Souls of Light stronger.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore is a huge threshold for us, so we need to strengthen our souls to cross it. Certain people even stay in the ninth line for years just to get more practice," Dorothy added with a weary smile on her face.</p>

  <p>The crystals in the sea would erode the Truth Boats. Fortunately for them, if a Truth Boat left the Sea of Truth before completely dissipating, it could still re-condense once it returned.</p>

  <p>All Zheng could see before him were the countless Truth Boats, continuously disappearing and condensing themselves.</p>

  <p>In other words, this location was just an enormous cultivating ground for souls.</p>

  <p>"Shall we begin as well, then?" Dorothy questioned Zheng as a reminder, still smiling.</p>

  <p>Zheng only nodded silently in agreement. Much like what the others had done, Zheng adjusted the Truth Boat's direction and let it withstand the sea's erosion.</p>

  <p>In this respect, the members of Dragon City had some advantages.</p>

  <p>Throughout the process of cultivating the Souls of Light, certain people bought soul pills repeatedly.</p>

  <p>At first, Zheng was very confused. Seeing as divine crystals couldn't be brought to this place, how would they even manage to shake on a deal?</p>

  <p>After listening to Dorothy though, Zheng ultimately understood the operation of the deal.</p>

  <p>One of the parties handed divine crystals over to the Mice League in order to guarantee the deal. Afterward, the soul pill was sold in the Sea of Truth, and the Mice League would pay the divine crystals to the other, acting as a third party.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, throughout the entire process, the Mice League would get some divine crystals as commission.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this kind of deals were not limited to the Sea of Truth. In fact, even the deals that took place on the Other Shore relied on the Mice League's guarantees. It was safe to say that every single day, these types of deals were taking place. They were far more common than anyone could imagine.</p>

  <p>As the guarantor, the Mice League itself earned great profit.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's words encouraged an amazed feeling inside Zheng. The group of Ear Mice in the Source World were indeed very smart.</p>

  <p>Before long, the days grew shorter, colder and autumn gave way to winter.</p>

  <p>The entire Dragon City was covered with a thin layer of white, sparkling snow.</p>

  <p>Most people stayed out in the ninth line for only six to eight hours at a time, but Zheng spent twice as much time in this place as them.</p>

  <p>When he wasn't here, Zheng went to the Sword Tower to study the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship and the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship; besides, he also spent a little time integrating the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Zheng was aware of everything that happened in his inner world. All he had to do was to follow the Evil God's method of merging the Godly Ways. The Evil God had used it in the past. Hence, this task wouldn't be a challenge for him.</p>

  <p>There was trouble, however. The Evil God wasn't a consummate True God at that time. It was important that when he merged the consummate Godly Ways, he'd need to pay special attention to a few points.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, another three months had passed. The crux of winter was over.</p>

  <p>Within the ninth line, a Truth Boat suddenly moved. At once, thousands of Truth Boats simultaneously moved forward as well.</p>

  <p>"Huh? What's going on?" Zheng blinked a few times in order to make sure he was seeing correctly. He was slightly stunned by the scene.</p>

  <p>"These people are going to break through to the Other Shore," Dorothy uttered in a low tone, still with a smile spreading on her lips.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go with them?" Zheng asked in a curious voice.</p>

  <p>"If you want, I guess. I'll keep you company," Dorothy answered.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had no problems getting to the Other Shore on her own. She had a Necklace of Mystic Soul.</p>

  <p>Despite that, she still believed that both she and Zheng needed to exercise their Souls of Light. And even if she did succeed, reaching the Other Shore too early wasn't the best idea.</p>

  <p>"Okay!" Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Both their Truth Boats began to move forward across the sea water.</p>

  <p>It was hard to imagine how difficult breaking through to the Other Shore would be, which was known as the last bottleneck. Every time someone tried to reach the Other Shore, it meant thousands of Truth Boats had worked together. It was a spectacular scene!</p>

  <p>Someone was capable of taking the lead for him and for this reason, Zheng was happily capable of relaxing.</p>

  <p>All the Truth Boats were divided into three lines while Dorothy's and Zheng's Truth Boats tailed a little behind.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>As the ahead Truth Boats moved on, waves rolled out behind them, causing rows of Truth Boats to undulate all at once.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, everybody!" someone called out in warning.</p>

  <p>"Before arriving at our destination, the waves will only keep getting stronger!"</p>

  <p>"If you can't steady your boat on your own, do yourself a favor and turn yourself back around!"</p>

  <p>As they moved forward through the tumultuous water, people continually shouted out loud warnings. The warnings were then passed on from one to the next, ensuring that everyone was given the same information.</p>

  <p>Seeing people die in their attempt to reach the Other Shore was quite common. In fact, this was also the rule in the ninth line.</p>

  <p>As soon as the warnings had been called, certain warriors left the group, turning their boats around to return. These warriors knew their limitations, so they dared not attempt reaching the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if Nicholas had wondered here for a long period of time all those years.' Zheng remembered that Nicholas too, had been a member of the ninth line. He had also been stuck in this place for quite a long time.</p>

  <p>It didn't mean that Nicholas was weak. He couldn't get his hands on any soul pills in the divine land, nor did he have the same resources as those in the Dragon City. Saying that it was difficult for Nicholas to completely rely on himself to reach the Other Shore was an understatement.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng swallowed a soul pill, the effects kicked in and the pill not only helped him resist the cold but equally calmed him down.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Dorothy chose to adjust her heartbeat a little, standing steadily at the head of the boat.</p>

  <p>Every time the sea waves surged, both Zheng and Dorothy struggled somewhat in maintaining the balance of their Truth Boats. In the thousands of people, chances were that only about a hundred of them could perform as steadily as Zheng and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>After the fleet moved forward approximate ten miles, the waves suddenly became larger and the cold wind roared loudly in their ears, nearly forcing their souls to freeze over like icicles.</p>

  <p>Both warning calls and shouts for help became increasingly intense. Both could be heard one after the next.</p>

  <p>"I, I can't hold on!" shouted the man in Zheng's left peripheral view.</p>

  <p>In a moment of complete desperation, the man immediately retreated from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>In certain ways, he had been quite lucky.</p>

  <p>Not far off in the distance, as the waves rose and fell, two Truth Boats had been turned over and thrown into the sea.</p>

  <p>Once the Souls of Light on the boats had equally fallen into the sea, they disappeared, leaving no trace behind.</p>

  <p>As a witness to the entire frantic scene, Zheng furrowed his brow and asked Dorothy from behind his shoulder, "Do many people die trying to break through to the Other Shore every time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and it's better now than it's been before. My grandma has told me many times that soul pills were a very rare find, a long time ago at least.</p>

  <p>Countless Souls of Light died in the ninth line back in her day. So much so, that she said the ninth line was actually called the Death's door. In an enormous crowd of ten thousand people, only one would reach the Other Shore, and nine thousand people would die..." Dorothy replied, her voice cold.</p>

  <p>As soon as the first person died, more and more people got scared and began to retreat.</p>

  <p>Now, at least two thirds of the thousands of people had begun to retreat.</p>

  <p>The remaining over three thousand people, on their behalf, were all ready to fight tooth and nail. Even in the face of such a terrible environment, they had no intentions of retreating whatsoever!</p>

  <p>With another ten miles traveled, the waves once again doubled in force and climbed in height. They were now unbelievably ferocious.</p>

  <p>A wave swept over and raised Zheng's Truth Boat up a good thirty or forty feet in height.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Watch out!" Dorothy reminded him, always with her watchful eyes.</p>

  <p>She was quite confident of Zheng's adaptability, but despite that, she couldn't shake the worried feeling she had.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood at the boat's head once again, sliding forward and defying the wave cleverly. As he reached the wave's peak however, his face suddenly dropped.</p>

  <p>A wave of more than a hundred feet in height was actually just ten miles ahead... and it was heading toward them!</p>

  <p>The Truth Boat was less than four meters in length and no more than two meters in height. There was no way in hell it was ever getting over such a huge wave.</p>
