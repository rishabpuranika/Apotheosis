  <p>
</p>

  <p>The heaven also had emotions. Could it be possible that it was originally a manifestation of a living being?</p>

  <p>It was the ruler of the universe but how powerful was it really?</p>

  <p>The myriad of emotions that flooded through Zheng made him understand the sheer helplessness the fragment had felt when it broke.</p>

  <p>He went back to what Xun had told him: the current heaven was the sky. After the old one had been destroyed, a new heaven had to be established to replace it. Countless warriors, after breaking through to the Life and Death Realm, would encounter life and death crises, namely the Small Heavenly Tribulation and the Big Heavenly Tribulation. Both were coursed through the sky.</p>

  <p>Once the old heaven had been destroyed, the new one replaced it, but how?</p>

  <p>These were all still unresolved questions and unfathomable secrets for Zheng, but his acquisition of the Heavenly Fragment meant that everything would unfold in due time.</p>

  <p>Besides the memories and emotions of the fragment itself, he also found something special.</p>

  <p>Rows of densely packed characters appeared and mapped themselves in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Each row of characters followed a format: the upper row had golden characters while the lower row was of a darker gold, resembling a question and an answer.</p>

  <p>These characters were the Law of Causality recorded in the Heavenly Fragment, but of course, Zheng had no idea what it was at the time being.</p>

  <p>The first row was the cause, and the second was the effect.</p>

  <p>This Law of Causality was the general principle of the universe. If a warrior wanted to cultivate cause and effect, he or she must choose this law that recorded all rules of causality.</p>

  <p>The seed one planted would grow flowers, plants, or trees.</p>

  <p>Hard work shall yield a harvest.</p>

  <p>The cultivation of a special technique would allow a warrior to break through at a certain time.</p>

  <p>Every living being, be it a simple plant or a mighty warrior, was encompassed by cause and effect, making the Law of Causality the superior rule of the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Fire Law, Water Law, Time Law, and Space Law could never hold a candle against it since they all belonged to the inferior laws.</p>

  <p>However, one couldn't exist without the other. Both the superior and inferior rules existed side by side and played a part together as the universe accorded.</p>

  <p>Of course, the rules that had been recorded in the Heavenly Fragment were from 3.6 billion years ago. The current heaven was the ruler of the sky and had its own rules.</p>

  <p>A golden light suddenly flared as Zheng swept his gaze across the rows of characters.</p>

  <p>It was as if his consciousness understood what it all meant.</p>

  <p>"The eternal cycle of reincarnation brings immortality."</p>

  <p>"The eternal cycle of reincarnation brings immortality."</p>

  <p>He repeated the words, unaware of the astonishing changes that were currently happening to his body.</p>

  <p>Margaret stood by his side. Someone who had created countless miracles shouldn't die so easily, right?</p>

  <p>As she looked at Zheng's unconscious face, she felt her heart sink with regret.</p>

  <p>Her top-grade Purple Power Body gave her the ability to raze the entire world to the ground and summon the young true spirits of the Purple Power World - at a price of course.</p>

  <p>Although the true spirits were still in their infancy, she had no doubt that they would be more than enough to deal with Eddie.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had told her that it was his fight and that he would not accept any help from other people. It was his fate and he had to settle it by himself.</p>

  <p>This was why Margaret had chosen not to make a move even if Zheng had been continuously pushed back during the battle. Had she launched an attack, she would have only angered Zheng. She was too afraid of angering such an arrogant fellow.</p>

  <p>However, his current state made her regret her choices. Given another chance, she would've chosen to summon the true spirits to kill Eddie at the cost of her own life.</p>

  <p>Even if that choice would have an impact on Zheng's warrior spirit, it would still be better than him being half-dead.</p>

  <p>Of course, Margaret did not know that if Zheng wanted to kill Eddie, there would've been no need to use her abilities. All he needed to do was to invite the Soul Sea Realm masters from the Sea God Continent to do it for him.</p>

  <p>Zheng now walked on the impartial, magnificent path of martial arts. He advanced with a nearly perfect posture towards the peak and did not allow any flaws to appear. It was not that his warrior spirit was affected by Eddie, but if he borrowed external help, Eddie would become an inner demon of his in the future. If that happened, there was a possibility of him exploding with power that could bring about unpredictable consequences.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Margaret frowned as she looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Xun asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"Zheng… His body seems to have shrunk a little!"</p>

  <p>Margaret blinked, her clear eyes filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Xun scoffed, walking closer towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, her face also filled with shock. "Wait. His body has indeed shrunk!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's stature had become smaller and his appearance no longer had any trace of his past life's trials or killing intent. He now possessed the innocence of childhood and his hair was also becoming shorter. In mere minutes, Zheng had made a transition from twenty years old to his fifteen-year-old self.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Margaret asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Xun shook her head. Even she had never seen such a strange phenomenon. The Demon Night had the power to regain youth but not under such circumstances as the one Zheng was undergoing now.</p>

  <p>The two ladies could only watch as Zheng's body continued to shrink. His fifteen-year-old appearance changed to a twelve-year-old one.</p>

  <p>His green robe had also become loose, unfit for the body of a child that he had reverted into.</p>

  <p>"He's getting smaller again!" Xun remarked in surprise.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng looked like he was seven or eight years old.</p>

  <p>Three or four years old.</p>

  <p>One or two years old.</p>

  <p>Until he became a newborn baby.</p>

  <p>Margaret's gaze flickered at the little baby in front of her. "So this is what he looked like when he was a baby?"</p>

  <p>He looked adorable with his round, bulging face and long lashes. If she wasn't so worried about what had just happened, Margaret would've picked him up and kissed him.</p>

  <p>Xun, however, thought very differently. This was the first time she had seen such a strange thing and it bothered her greatly. If she had to guess, it might be the Heavenly Fragment that had caused such a shocking change to Zheng.</p>

  <p>What exactly did he comprehend from the fragment? Did he activate some kind of Law of Causality?</p>

  <p>Just as she thought about it, Zheng's body suddenly began to expand. From an infant, he gradually grew up and became a little boy.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Xun's eyes flashed. "Is he… Is this body rebuilding itself or is it a reincarnation?"</p>

  <p>Even Xun and the cyan dragon had very limited understanding of the Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>From what they knew, the Law of Causality was heaven's purest law. Even Supreme Lords had difficulty mastering it. Therefore, those who managed such a heavy task were considered the best of the best.</p>

  <p>From what Xun could remember, both body rebuilding and reincarnation could achieve this effect. However, there was no way to be sure since this was the first time she had witnessed this kind of Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter which one it is?" Margaret asked with genuine concern.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't," Xun replied. "If his body is rebuilt, it will only become purer. If his body is reincarnated, it won't have any effect on him but I believe he will wake up."</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was like a freak existence in the entire universe. His body had already become purer after being infiltrated by the primordial energy.</p>

  <p>Body rebuilding was a kind of adventure to other warriors, but it might not be a good thing for Zheng since a rebuilt body might not be as strong as his current one.</p>

  <p>"I see…"</p>

  <p>Margaret nodded. She did not understand or really care about what was going on. All she wanted was for Zheng to wake up.</p>
