<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1597 A Mysterious Sword (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng's provocation worked.</p>

  <p>From the darkness, a long hook shot toward Zheng and instantly caught him.</p>

  <p>The moment it gripped Zheng, his body was bound by a strange rule. This rule did not allow him to resist the attack. His entire body was as if imprisoned in chains and he was pulled into the darkness like a weightless feather.</p>

  <p>"Now!" Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng was pulled over, Hailey let go of the bowstring.</p>

  <p>Before her Moon Bursting Flame Bow were three swirling balls of flame that floated in the air.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The target of the three round flames was no other than Zheng!</p>

  <p>Truthfully, Hailey too hesitated at the moment.</p>

  <p>The Moon Bursting Flame Bow could be called a supreme divine weapon and naturally had its strong points. She was unable to fully unleash the power of the flame arrow. An ordinary martial artist would never be able to withstand its full power. Even an ace talent would be likely to back off.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had insisted on it. He had promised her that nothing would happen to him.</p>

  <p>In the end, Hailey could only do as she was told.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Lone snorted. Someone else from his side was pulling Zheng over. His thin figure flashed as he marched toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lone had been unable to come up with a method to break the stalemate, but that did not mean that he was afraid of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No matter what tricks you are playing, you must die now that you have come over to our side," Lone said in a cold voice. He waved one of his arms and a long sword materialized in his hand.</p>

  <p>Lone had another famed name.</p>

  <p>He was also known as Lone, the Otherworldly Swordsman.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman was the only ace talent among all independent warriors.</p>

  <p>An ace talent was the hope of a large clan.</p>

  <p>Usually only a few ace talents could be found in a clan.</p>

  <p>To raise an ace talent often required sparing no efforts on the clan's part.</p>

  <p>When Lucille had participated in the battles of the Illusion Battlefield, even the patriarch of the Ji Clan had to personally pay attention to her.</p>

  <p>However, in the universe, there were always cases of unique existences.</p>

  <p>Lone was one of them.</p>

  <p>It had taken him thirty-one years to reach the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>The universe was rife with talents, especially because of the world of chaos. The time period of thirty-one years was not particularly less.</p>

  <p>After all, after the beginning of the world of chaos, the core talents reached the Soul Sea Realm quite rapidly.</p>

  <p>In the past, it was rare for someone to reach the Soul Sea Realm before the age of fifty. But now, it was not a special occurrence to do so. Many core talents had reached the Soul Sea Realm at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two.</p>

  <p>But what was truly impressive about Lone was that he had gained that achievement all by himself. He had transformed from an unknown independent warrior to the Otherworldly Swordsman who defeated an ace talent from the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>Because of that battle, Lone, the Otherworldly Swordsman, became well-known.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Thoughtless Minds had no clue that an independent warrior could create such havoc.</p>

  <p>The four great clans extended him an olive branch.</p>

  <p>The ace talent was just an address, but Lone had defeated his opponent, which meant that he already possessed the strength to fight an ace talent.</p>

  <p>Thus, Lone was an ace talent himself.</p>

  <p>No one wanted to let go of such a superior talent.</p>

  <p>However, Lone stubbornly refused them.</p>

  <p>Although he knew enough about the power of the four great clans, he was also aware that if he could obtain the guidance of a Supreme Lord, it would be unimaginably beneficial to him. Still, he chose to refuse their offer.</p>

  <p>The reason was that his sword made him reject it.</p>

  <p>Lone had only been able to achieve so much because of his sword.</p>

  <p>Before that, he had been an ordinary, impoverished martial artist. With his cultivation at the nature level, he had been like a speck of dust in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Once, when Lone had been battling it out with someone, he was almost beaten to death and then thrown into a disorderly cemetery. He lay there for seven days and seven nights and found the sword beside a corpse after he woke up.</p>

  <p>The dark iron sword looked ordinary and nothing like a godly weapon. It had been abandoned at a cemetery, so it was obvious that no one had bothered to keep it.</p>

  <p>The moment Lone touched the sword, he was enveloped by a strong consciousness.</p>

  <p>This dark iron sword that he now held in his hand had a consciousness of its own.</p>

  <p>The supreme martial arts that he cultivated and the rare secret lands that he explored had all been bestowed upon him by the iron sword. This iron sword was not only his strongest weapon and asset, but also his master, his benefactor.</p>

  <p>After obtaining this sword, Lone rose to prominence. As an independent warrior, he had amassed a great many treasures in the supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>He had also participated in the competition of the four great clans as an independent warrior. From an unknown junior, he had slaughtered his way into the domain of the ace talents.</p>

  <p>From then on, Lone only rose to prominence.</p>

  <p>Now, in the midst of the Thoughtless Minds, he was walking shoulder to shoulder with Lawson, Nathan, and Lucille.</p>

  <p>Most people considered what Lone had done to be miraculous among independent warriors.</p>

  <p>"In absolute strength, all schemes are futile." Suddenly, the consciousness of Lone's sword communicated with him.</p>

  <p>"I know. Before… I shouldn't have hesitated." Lone's face was unreadable. At this moment, he suddenly wielded his sword as he charged toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>The sword had accompanied Lone for many years. He had speculated on its origins.</p>

  <p>It did not belong to this round of the universe, rather, it came from a higher level of existence; an existence that surpassed the heavens.</p>

  <p>The sword had informed him that the region was known as the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the beginning when the sword had been with him, they had only used up each other's strengths. However, after being in the company of each other for so many years, their relationship had only grown deeper. He knew some of the secrets of the sword, and the sword helped him to become a Godly Genius and surpass the heavens.</p>
