<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now, the Monkey Masters saw the legend unfold in the chaos, and it made them uneasy.</p>

  <p>If the main world were compared to a huge world, the chaos would just be a small puddle.</p>

  <p>So a human who came from the puddle inherited the ancestry-level bloodline?</p>

  <p>It seemed like a joke.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Monkey Spirit King waited patiently for Zheng to speak.</p>

  <p>This was surprising, especially because among the four leaders of the Four Spirits Sect, he was the most impatient and innocent one.</p>

  <p>When the Four Spirits Sect attacked their enemies on the edge of the main world, he fought hundreds of battles and took thousands of lives.</p>

  <p>All of this was just to save a Monkey Master who was not even important to the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Being imprisoned in the dream for more than a thousand chaotic eras, he reflected on everything he had done.</p>

  <p>If he were more cautious and less naive, would things have ended differently?</p>

  <p>He did not know how many times he had this thought.</p>

  <p>Was it a millions times? Or did it go over a hundred million times?</p>

  <p>When he realized that Zheng had the ancestry-level bloodline in his body, he was shocked but did his best to maintain a calm expression.</p>

  <p>"I don't know.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Divine Courtyard was already deserted by the time I arrived.</p>

  <p>When I entered the sacred cup, the light columns lit up,"</p>

  <p>Zheng replied genuinely.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Divine Courtyard was built by the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Monkey Spirit King knew more about the ancestry-level bloodline than Zheng ever did.</p>

  <p>Zheng could no longer hide from him, so he decided it was best to answer honestly.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was a good step to get the Monkey Spirit King on his side.</p>

  <p>"Light columns? How many would you say lit up?" the Monkey Spirit King asked patiently.</p>

  <p>"If I recall correctly, it was all of them," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>The jaws of Manuel, Hagar, Tearrag and Nereus dropped down in awe.</p>

  <p>Though they wanted to react, all of them were speechless.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the expression of the Monkey Spirit King was hard to read.</p>

  <p>He mastered the art of keeping still, and could probably do so even if the whole world collapsed right in front of him.</p>

  <p>Even when the rest gasped, his expression never changed.</p>

  <p>"Why all?" asked the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>This didn't make any sense. Mere talent was not a reason, either.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head in confusion. "I... I don't know."</p>

  <p>One hundred and eighty-seven light columns had risen. At that time, he was completely immersed in the ancestry-level bloodline, so he paid no attention to the outside world.</p>

  <p>The moment he woke up, he saw that the light columns below the sacred cup were all lit up.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King saw Zheng's sincere eyes and felt a little dubious.</p>

  <p>However, it was meaningless to dwell on it now.</p>

  <p>"This is incredible!"</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King raised his hands in the air. "How should I repay you for waking me up?"</p>

  <p>In this world, returning a favor was a high honor.</p>

  <p>Even if Manuel and the others didn't point it out, the Monkey Spirit King could tell that Zheng had intentions to be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"Well..."</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged his shoulders and turned towards the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "It was actually the Primeval Lord of Heaven who helped you wake up, so..."</p>

  <p>"But I am asking you." The Monkey Spirit King didn't let him finish.</p>

  <p>Because the Primeval Lord of Heaven was the leader of the human heroes, Zheng naturally asked him for opinions.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had to make his own decision, he grew uneasy.</p>

  <p>After a few deep breaths, he collected himself and continued to speak.</p>

  <p>"I want a way to protect the chaos so that it won't come to an end and so the Finale Way can be achieved," Zheng requested.</p>

  <p>He figured it was a good opportunity to get ahead on his plans.</p>

  <p>From the divine land to the Source World, Zheng was always on the move.</p>

  <p>The closer he got to the truth, the more lost he became.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, he was not at all interested in the internal strife of the Four Spirits Sect or the previous human civilization.</p>

  <p>However, what unfolded felt like a rope that dragged him to the Other Shore, the Three Purities Stage, and the Night View Island inch by inch.</p>

  <p>"The Finale Way? Is that to prevent the chaos from disorder?" the Monkey Spirit King asked with concern.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not a difficult thing you ask for," the Monkey Spirit King said.</p>

  <p>This was too easy for him.</p>

  <p>After all, the Four Spirits Sect built many worlds which served just as their energy pools.</p>

  <p>The Finale Way that Zheng mentioned was a method to stop the operation of a pool.</p>

  <p>When some creatures from the secondary worlds had the ancestry-level bloodline and obtained positions in the Four Spirits Sect, they occasionally asked to halt the energy pools they came from.</p>

  <p>This way, the worlds within the energy pools never experienced chaos or destruction again. However, this also meant they would not produce any new energy.</p>

  <p>"It may not seem difficult to you, but the Snake Spirit Sect is on the opposite side of us," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back then, to prevent the completion of the Finale Way, the Element Spirit Civilization had to hide some Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>This was done without the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Now, with the intervention of the Snake Spirit Sect, the chaos might not be as simple as it once was.</p>

  <p>Completing the Finale Way could be unimaginably difficult.</p>

  <p>"Would you want me to help you deal with the Snake Spirit Sect?" the Monkey Spirit King asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, actually." Zheng nodded again.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Monkey Spirit King zoned out and got lost in thought.</p>

  <p>He reminisced about his past. It was because of the Snake Spirit King that he ended up this way.</p>

  <p>Within the long years he spent in the dream, he imagined chopping Cornelius up into pieces.</p>

  <p>Since then, he swore to himself that Cornelius would pay for what he had done.</p>

  <p>"Count me in." The Monkey Spirit King smiled.</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard this, his nerves finally relaxed. He was no longer jittery.</p>

  <p>Since they'd entered the Three Purities Stage, they had been running away nonstop.</p>

  <p>Now, they finally found the human heroes on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't expect that the Snake Spirit Sect was behind the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Monkey Spirit King was on their side. Otherwise, they would never have exited the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much!" Zheng said and bowed before the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King smiled faintly. "Follow me."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and motioned for Zheng to stand on his palm.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng stood securely, he flew towards the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>As they approached, Zheng could easily see that the Ghost Mountain was still under repair.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had created a huge, gaping crack in the center of the mountain, one that would be difficult to repair in a short time.</p>

  <p>"I agree to this because we have the same goal," the Monkey Spirit King explained. "The Snake Spirit Sect is my enemy."</p>

  <p>"Is this because the Snake Masters want to take away your body?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No." The Monkey Spirit King shook his head and pointed towards the Ghost Mountain. "Do you know why so many Treacherous Beings exist in the Ghost Mountain?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, having already discussed this with the others. "They were not actually Treacherous Beings, but living creatures from the main world," he noted.</p>

  <p>"Right. Back then, I stored creatures in the Ghost Mountain so that the myriad creatures of the main world had chances to survive."</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King paused and sighed before continuing, "But Cornelius was just too scheming. Because of him, I have lost my physical body, and so have the monkey spirits. It came to a point that even the creatures in the Ghost Mountain have become Treacherous Beings themselves."</p>
