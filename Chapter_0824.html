<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 824 Communicating With The Stars </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was just a wisp of consciousness, not breathing, not comprehending. He was only instinctively reacting to the shocking scene that was playing out in front of him.</p>

  <p>He had never imagined that such a huge beast could exist in this world!</p>

  <p>Although there were nine Genuine Dragons in Luo Zheng's mind, they existed in a form that concealed their sizes from Luo Luo Zheng. But he guessed that even those nine Genuine Dragons would not be as big as the giant beast.</p>

  <p>How could such a huge beast even survive? Wouldn't it have destroyed countless worlds if it had kept moving like this? What did it eat? And how did it grow so big?</p>

  <p>There were no answers to these questions.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng's consciousness was out of his body, he couldn't ask the cyan dragon all this. It looked like he would have to wait till his consciousness returned to his body before he could ask his questions.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was worried.</p>

  <p>The incredibly giant beast was not far from the world Luo Luo Zheng was in. He was not clear about the giant beast's destination, but if it turned even a little, it would pass through the world Luo Luo Zheng was in and crush it in a single step.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled rather helplessly as the thought crossed his mind.</p>

  <p>In this boundless universe, he was too minuscule, even smaller than a grain of sand.</p>

  <p>Even in the world he was in, he was only one in a trillion.</p>

  <p>As he ascended, Luo Luo Zheng saw a large, grayish-brown tree growing on the densely packed scales. The root of the large tree had dozens of "scales" running through it. This meant that just the root itself could penetrate dozens of worlds.</p>

  <p>The height of the tree was even more frightening. It was at least a hundred times taller than its rhizome.</p>

  <p>If the tree were to fall, it would probably get through thousands of worlds in a second. And when you considered the trunk's width, this number would probably multiply ten times.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only sigh.</p>

  <p>The speed at which his consciousness leaped was still increasing. He further sped up as he distanced himself from the densely packed scales. At the same time, he discovered more things like an immeasurably huge mountain and the Stonehenge on the scales.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng felt an abnormal fit of oscillation from the universe before him.</p>

  <p>He looked up and spotted a pitch black thing, continuously rotating, not far to his left.</p>

  <p>Black.</p>

  <p>That was the only word he could use to describe it.</p>

  <p>In reality, it wouldn't even have a color because it was only continuously absorbing everything into it, even the light.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng's consciousness would not be affected by any external force. Although the black mass was terrifying, it was unable to drag his consciousness into it.</p>

  <p>Under the constant migrations and leaps of his consciousness, he finally approached the first star.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng looked at it from afar, he could see that it was rotating slowly and its surface was an icy blue. Approaching it brought to his consciousness the awareness of a strong will being transmitted from the star.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's wisp of consciousness suddenly felt a chill of terror spasm through it, as if Luo Luo Zheng was in a world of ice and snow.</p>

  <p>"Is this the will of the star? D-does it have its own thoughts?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered in awe as he looked at the spinning sphere. "This star seems to be rejecting me!"</p>

  <p>Unable to communicate, Luo Zheng's consciousness continued to soar. He had to keep searching for the next star.</p>

  <p>According to what the red dragon had said, the more star power he could draw into his own body, the more powerful his stellar body would become.</p>

  <p>If he could interact with all the stars in the sky, he could only imagine how powerful he could become! No wonder the Stellar Body was called a transcendent divine might.</p>

  <p>Only such a powerful refinement technique deserved to be called transcendent.</p>

  <p>After passing by the icy blue star, Luo Zheng's consciousness continued to travel through the Great Void, heading deeper into the starry sky.</p>

  <p>The stars were at great distances from each other. Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng seemed to be able to make his consciousness travel extremely fast by using a secret technique of the Stellar Body. Soon, he found the next star.</p>

  <p>This star was milky-white, and a huge whirlpool rippled on its surface. The whirlpool was like a storm that spanned thousands of miles, and was slowly rotating, as if someone had poured a glass of milk onto this star and fashioned it into a whirlpool.</p>

  <p>"This star is also rejecting me." A wry smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face. He felt the star's will just as he approached it.</p>

  <p>He then found the third star.</p>

  <p>It was crimson red all over, and the surface of the star burned with a menacing flame. As soon as he approached the star, he discovered that the massive flame on its surface rose higher and higher, and it could stretch upward for thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>"It's roaring at me!" Luo Luo Zheng said in wonder. "This star is so violent. Looks like it has a bad temper." Luo Luo Zheng was left speechless. Although he didn't want to use the word "temper" to describe the wills of these stars, they seemed to be sentient, like human beings. There were all sorts of personalities; some were gentle, some were irritable, and some were very quiet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng encountered all sorts of rejections as he passed more than forty stars in a row.</p>

  <p>He finally stopped at a Xun star.</p>

  <p>A gentle will tugged at him the moment he approached this star.</p>

  <p>If there could be a gender difference between the stars, he would describe this star as a female. It did not reject him. On the contrary, Luo Luo Zheng felt it was glad about his arrival.</p>

  <p>"Is it done?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked, his heart skipping a beat.</p>

  <p>From what the red dragon had said, communicating with the stars for the first time was an extremely difficult exercise.</p>

  <p>But he seemed to have succeeded.</p>

  <p>A vast and formless will enveloped his consciousness. Although his consciousness could not feel any warmth, he still felt as if he were in a womb.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng established a connection with the Xun star, sensing its thoughts.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gazed at the purple star quietly, concentrating hard as if it were trying to tell him something. The will of the star was constantly fluctuating, like a beautiful woman slowly narrating her thoughts. It was a pity that Luo Luo Zheng couldn't understand what it meant.</p>

  <p>After communicating with the first star, Luo Luo Zheng did not choose to retract his consciousness. Instead, he chose to fly to the next star.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to measure the number of stars in the sky. He had leaped over a hundred stars in a row, but they had all rejected him.</p>

  <p>'Feels like I am too greedy, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought faintly.</p>

  <p>In the end, he gave up searching for a new star. He had established a connection the first time he had communicated with a star. That was a good enough result for the time being.</p>

  <p>Travelling through the void with his consciousness had been an unimaginable feat for him. But he had used the secret technique of the transcendent divine might and managed to do it.</p>

  <p>During the journey back, his gaze was once again focused on those densely packed scales. At the moment, he was extremely far from those scales and was unable to see the end of them. This was because the end was completely covered in darkness, as if it was in a faraway place that could not even be reached by light.</p>

  <p>'The boundless universe is connected to the boundless universe. Since there are millions of great worlds, what is at the end of the millions of great worlds?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head, his mind reeling from his thoughts and rendering him unable to explore the question any further.</p>

  <p>The Stellar Body seemed to employ a secret technique that borrowed gravity from the stars to pull his consciousness out. That was probably why he could maintain such a high speed as he approached the stars and touch the gravity of the stars, as he shuttled back and forth between them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't roam the Great Void with his own power. He wouldn't be able to explore the distant deep space and the edge of the boundless universe with his current strength.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure how strong he would have to become to be able to use his physical body to travel through the Great Void and explore the endless space.</p>
