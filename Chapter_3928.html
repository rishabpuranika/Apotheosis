<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3928 The Origin Of The Light Region </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Raising his Cyan Misty Sword high, the Grandmaster of Heaven had a white light column strike him.</p>

  <p>While the chaos wasn't pitch-black, it was rather dim.</p>

  <p>The eye-catching white light column appeared abruptly? it seemed to purify everything somehow.</p>

  <p>The moment it appeared, Luo Zheng raised his brows.</p>

  <p>"The Great Sanskrit Light?"</p>

  <p>Once Feng Ge became a purified being, she mastered the Great Sanskrit Light. Soon after, Luo Zheng became a purified being himself and was highly familiar with the Great Sanskrit Light, so he could recognize it at a glance.</p>

  <p>Was the Grandmaster of Heaven also a purified being, then? Luo Zheng wondered because the man seemed to be able to release the Great Sanskrit Light at will.</p>

  <p>But the Great Sanskrit Light could only harm the creatures in the Dark Region? it was completely useless against the creatures from the Light Region.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the chaos weren't afraid of this light in the least. Was it somehow related to the "foundation" the Grandmaster of Heaven mentioned?</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng had become a purified being, he still hadn't been able to figure out the true relationship between the Dark Region and the Light Region. In Stage Fourteen, an Insect Master had told him that their race's ancestor had gone to the dark sky? something that couldn't be found at Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng climbed up to the Blooming Jade Stage, he learned that the Dark Region was under the Element Spirit Civilization's control. So was the Light Region controlled by the Nihility race, Luo Zheng wondered?</p>

  <p>"I don't care what kind of power you have. I'll smash you to pieces!"</p>

  <p>Taking the lead, Fuxi waved his hand from where he stood.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams marks weren't imprinted on the Grandmaster of Heaven's body, but on the surface of the column of the Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>And so Fuxi began waving his hands at top speed.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>In an instant, Fuxi unleashed countless palm prints that exploded along with the Eight Diagrams marks? the force they released was nothing short of terrifying. But the Great Sanskrit Light column wasn't damaged in the least.</p>

  <p>It had managed to resist every single one of Fuxi's attacks.</p>

  <p>"Well..."</p>

  <p>Fuxi seemed desperate at this point.</p>

  <p>He had always been proud to be the strongest warrior in the chaos. But just now, he utterly failed after pushing himself to his absolute limit. The seemingly weak light column was impenetrable.</p>

  <p>This indicated just how great the gap between him and the Grandmaster of Heaven was.</p>

  <p>"It's your turn," Fuxi murmured to his real self that was hiding within his body.</p>

  <p>Once he requested his real self to release his physical body, his real self had done as promised. After all, the latter was merely an energy soul. It was impossible for it to forcibly occupy Fuxi's physical body.</p>

  <p>But Fuxi's own strength was far inferior to that of his real self. He was well aware that it was more suitable for his real self to fight in this sort of battle.</p>

  <p>And so Fuxi's real self obtained control over the body once again. "That's the purest light in the Light Region. It's a method that only the purified beings have. The light shouldn't be so strong."</p>

  <p>As Fuxi's real self was observing, Herbert rushed up first.</p>

  <p>While Gerald and Judson also hated the Grandmaster of Heaven, Herbert was hell-bent on killing him after being previously betrayed by the man.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A circular, serrated bone plate grew upon Herbert's back. As it spun, several slender bones began extending from it.</p>

  <p>The slender bones then extended rapidly. While they looked like Herbert's wings, they didn't extend backward as normal wings did. Instead, they extended forward, forming a great circular space in front of Herbert, entrapping the Grandmaster of Heaven within.</p>

  <p>"I have many kinds of cages. The Lawless Cage is merely one of them. This Bone Corroding Cage is my greatest masterpiece!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the Grandmaster of Heaven trapped in his cage, Herbert was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>The Bone Corroding Cage was a terrifying place of killing. Herbert had always been rather strange, but among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, he boasted about the most profound study of the truth power.</p>

  <p>Once the Bone Corroding Cage covered the Grandmaster of Heaven, transparent bone membrane quickly appeared on either side of the bones, transforming the entire cage into an oval sphere.</p>

  <p>Soon after, yellow mist rose within the cage? a mist that could corrode all tangible materials. Up until then, all things it had touched corroded in an instant.</p>

  <p>And so the yellow mist began intertwining with the white light like water being poured into a boiling pot of oil.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Under the violent reaction, the yellow mist rolled crazily within the cage.</p>

  <p>But the light column was slightly shaking? instead of dispersing, it neutralized the yellow mist, forming a layer of harmless black powder at the very bottom of the cage.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't work?" Herbert's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>While the Bone Corroding Cage couldn't kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, he figured it would do him some damage at the very least.</p>

  <p>But the seemingly ordinary light column was indestructible.</p>

  <p>"Let me try!"</p>

  <p>Judson flew up to the Grandmaster of Heaven's level. A silver spear appeared in his grip as he stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Saint Killing Spear!"</p>

  <p>It was not merely Judson's theurgy, but also the most powerful material he had ever created.</p>

  <p>The moment the spear was thrown out, it turned into ten identical spears, all shifting into streaks of silver light that poured down on the light column.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>With some cracking sounds, the spear broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>But Judson had expected the spear to shatter. It wasn't particularly sturdy, after all. It was brittle.</p>

  <p>But much to his surprise, the spear failed to even pierce through the light column. His strongest theurgy seemed to be a mere joke before the Grandmaster of Heaven. As a normally aloof and arrogant Chaos Ancient God, he found the fact was hard to face.</p>

  <p>In the light column, the Grandmaster of Heaven still held the Cyan Misty Sword. It greedily sucked the white light. This white light formed several flowing light spots on the sword's surface as infinite power gathered within it.</p>

  <p>"It's useless. You can't penetrate the power of the foundation," said the Grandmaster of Heaven proudly.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng suddenly appeared beside the light column. He stared at it from nearby and said, "This seems to be the Great Sanskrit Light. I am a purified being as well, but as far as I know, the Great Sanskrit Light works only on creatures of the Dark Region."</p>

  <p>"You have no more than a superficial knowledge of light," snorted the other.</p>

  <p>It was clear that he didn't take Luo Zheng seriously in spite of their shared status.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Luo Zheng paid no mind to the other's attitude and asked further, "So the power of the foundation you mentioned is also based on the Great Sanskrit Light?"</p>

  <p>"Yes... So what?" Realizing that Luo Zheng was fishing for information, the Grandmaster of Heaven glared at him.</p>

  <p>The latter only smiled faintly. "If you don't want to say it, then forget it. The light column is powerful, but can it block me?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he reached out, pushing at the column's surface.</p>

  <p>While the Grandmaster of Heaven was highly confident in the foundation's power, his heart couldn't help but race in worry as he saw Luo Zheng's palm push on it.</p>

  <p>'This guy is just too strange? I'm not sure if ...' he thought to himself. When Luo Zheng's palm touched the light column, the bloodline in his body began fluctuating chaotically.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline needed to change its very structure each time it restrained the external energy. But this time, the fluctuation was far more violent.</p>
