  <p>
</p>

  <p>The seven people from the Celestial Position race didn't understand how Luo Luo Zheng could break the black wind blades.</p>

  <p>Fifteen hundred miles away, there stood a mountain in the sea. It was estimated that it stood at a height of hundreds of feet above sea level.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng directed the power to the mountain and eight explosions burst out in quick succession.</p>

  <p>The mountain looked colorful. It had remained unharmed over the millions of years it had been in the violent storm of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, constantly slashed by the black wind blades.</p>

  <p>This mountain was the Magnetic Sacred Mountain that had been lost to the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>Most part of the mountain was hidden under the sea and only a small part stuck out of the water. Fierce waves swept and crashed against it and the wind blades kept cutting at it, but the mountain stood erect and unshakable.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had fought against the terrible force of the Heavenly Tribulation, he had shifted all the force to the five million mountains in the great world. It caused every mountain, except the ones in the Eastern Region, to be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't damaged the great world on purpose and he wasn't willing to do so either. He had felt sorry, guilty even, and thought that maybe he had done so for his own sake. The Magnetic Sacred Mountain was so firm that nothing could harm it. He should have shifted the force to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. It was a pity that the situation had been urgent at the time, and he hadn't been able to think of it carefully before going ahead with his plan.</p>

  <p>He had learned a lesson from that incident and he became more cautious from then on, careful not to make the mistake again.</p>

  <p>A whirring sound announced that the Eight-Diagram Wheel was flying forward.</p>

  <p>The seven people of the Celestial Position race resisted the dense black wind blades with everything they had.</p>

  <p>Max held on to his crutch and said anxiously, "Delroy, we can't go on like this. Sacrifice something you have!"</p>

  <p>"I've already used my Seven Stars Plate five times! I don't want to waste it again," Delroy said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>Delroy owned a precious treasure called the Seven Stars Plate. It was a kind of a supreme divine weapon, but it could only be used seven times.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Delroy had survived several crises by relying on this Seven Stars Plate. It could be said that the seven opportunities of using the plate meant that it could save his life seven times.</p>

  <p>Which was why he really hated the idea of wasting one of his valuable opportunities here.</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Ocean of Stars is vast and I don't know how long it will take for us to cross such a long distance. Do you think we can make it the way we're going?" Max asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Delroy rolled his eyes and retorted, "Why don't you use your Holy Blood Secret Skill?"</p>

  <p>"Hum! Do you really think so?" Max snorted acidly, glaring fiercely at Delroy.</p>

  <p>At the glare, Delroy thrust his hand into his Sumeru Space and reluctantly took out his milky white Seven Stars Plate.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was disappointed at the conversation between these two men. They were all in big trouble and they should be united right now.</p>

  <p>But maybe these men were too strong and didn't deem the storm as a real crisis. If the Soul Sea Realm cultivators from the four divine kingdoms had come here instead, the wind blades might have slashed them to rags.</p>

  <p>When the Seven Stars Plate worked, Delroy's eyes lit up like the stars.</p>

  <p>Although it was daytime and there were thick clouds floating in the sky, Luo Luo Zheng could see seven stars shining overhead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he saw what was happening. He realized that the principle of the Seven Stars Plate was similar to the Stellar Body that the red dragon had taught him. The difference between the two skills was that while Luo Zheng's Stellar Body was connected to his body, Delroy's Seven Stars Plate was connected to the seven stars in the sky and had a limit on how many times it could be used.</p>

  <p>"Zing, zing, zing ..."</p>

  <p>With a zinging sound, a milky white enchanted barrier appeared on the Seven Stars Plate, which then enlarged quickly to spread all around.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before everyone was enveloped in the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The milky white enchanted barrier would sink when the countless wind blades slammed against it, but wouldn't break.</p>

  <p>It seemed to be very soft, though it was made of a rather tenacious material.</p>

  <p>"We are safe now. The Seven Stars Plate's performance of isolation is strong enough to avoid the attacks of black wind blades," Delroy told the others, but he sounded unhappy. The enchanted barrier had blocked the deadly wind blades, but it looked like he was still not happy about utilizing the Seven Stars Plate one more time.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Dorothea and Woody breathed a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Max shook his head and said, "The storm is abnormal anyway."</p>

  <p>"The whole great world is essentially abnormal," Delroy muttered unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>They had studied the information related to the great world before setting out from the Celestial Position. The ascending path of the great world had been destroyed and the people there couldn't fly to the Upper World using normal methods. It was just a minor problem, though, because in the millions of great worlds, it wasn't the only one that had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>So they didn't pay much attention to the danger they might face. But they had just been chased all the way by the Shadow Creature in the void.</p>

  <p>They had managed to escape and had encountered a terrible storm, every single experience completely unexpected.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng agreed with Max. The Chaotic Ocean of Stars had existed since ancient times. The storm had completely separated the Central Region from the four divine kingdoms. So although the two continents weren't that far apart, there had been little contact between them for a number of years. The question now was: how did the storm come into being?</p>

  <p>Perhaps nobody knew the answer.</p>

  <p>The wind blades whirred and the Eight-diagram Wheel they were on galloped smoothly forward.</p>

  <p>Max kept going over the possible causes of the storm and kept quickly contradicting his conclusions himself. "No matter how it happened, a storm of this intensity is not supposed to occur in the Lower World,"</p>

  <p>Delroy said carelessly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shrugged. He thought Delroy to be arrogant to be looking down on the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Delroy frowned at Luo Zheng's reaction. He suddenly remembered what Luo Luo Zheng had just done to the wind blades. Even more fantastic than the dangerous storm was Luo Zheng's ability to withstand the black wind blades with his physical body.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, may I ask you a question? How did you break those wind blades?</p>

  <p>You do know that the black wind blades contain the power of the five layers of the Wind Law," asked Delroy, staring at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Delroy's question reminded the others about what had just happened.</p>

  <p>Woody and Dorothea had just calmed down and hadn't gotten to think about it. Everyone looked inquiringly at Luo Luo Zheng. "You broke those wind blades with your fists. How are you not injured?" Dorothea asked, coming over to Luo Luo Zheng, grabbing his hands, and examining them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know how to answer this question. He just chuckled and said,</p>

  <p>"Compared to yours, mine is just an insignificant skill."</p>

  <p>Dorothea raised an eyebrow. "You don't want to tell us?"</p>

  <p>"It's really hard to explain," Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said.</p>

  <p>They knew that Luo Luo Zheng was acting modest and hiding something. But they couldn't really force him to tell them his secret. After all, everyone had their own secrets to keep. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng was not their enemy and bore no hostility towards them. If it was confirmed that Luo Luo Zheng had really attained the title, no matter what the title, they would be comrades-in-arms.</p>

  <p>Everyone lapsed into silence as they looked at the dense wind blades raging outside the enchanted barrier. Even the great masters in the Spirit Supreme Realm felt small and weak in the face of nature and its omnipotence. "Max, what is the creature that followed us in the void?</p>

  <p>The big head." Luo Luo Zheng broke the silence.</p>

  <p>The storm was severe but the Spirit Supreme Realm masters were powerful enough to handle it. They could block the wind blades using their skills despite how troublesome the blades were. And going by Delroy and Max's conversation, it looked like they still had other skills to manage the storm.</p>

  <p>But when the big head had chased them in the void, Max's face had paled with fear. 'What in the Lower World could make him so frightened?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered.</p>
