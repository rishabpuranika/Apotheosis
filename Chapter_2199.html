<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tianxing was being quietly observed by some of the Tie Clan members either sitting or standing around the mountain.</p>

  <p>It was known that a piece of mud could be sold for five hundred divine might coins which shocked everyone. The elders of the Tie Clan announced that whoever dug out another piece of that mud would receive a generous reward.</p>

  <p>Wanting to try their luck to obtain the reward, everyone including women and children in the Tie Clan moved out.</p>

  <p>But no matter how deep they dug, the mud would always turn out to be ordinary. They had never run into the kind of mud that could jump and run and would be spiritual again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood at the edge of the large pit. Looking down, he saw that the pit as deep as three thousand feet was dug beneath the whole mountain.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for the divine citizens to dig such a huge pit in such a short amount of time. The True Gods of the Tie Clan must have been involved, and some of them seemed to be mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed in his heart. These True Gods were truly different from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Living in the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Zheng had always thought that the True Gods was a lofty existence. No one ever dared to offend them as they looked down upon all living beings below the True God's level.</p>

  <p>They were out of touch, and nothing could stop them.</p>

  <p>After he arrived in the divine land, Luo Zheng discovered that these True Gods were more like ordinary people to some extent.</p>

  <p>In order to preserve the purity of their mortal bodies, the martial artists of the Evolutionary Universe would usually choose not to eat grains saving them a great deal of trouble. For those who continued to eat grain, they had to purify their bodies every once in a while.</p>

  <p>Only few True Gods of the divine land chose not to eat. They only viewed all kinds of delicacies as a great pleasure.</p>

  <p>The Tie Clan had many True Gods, and due to the benefits of the five hundred divine might coins, they had dug such a huge pit. Every single one of them were affected, controlled, and driven crazy by the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng realized that this scene might have something wrong with it. He once again asked in his mind, "Master Evil, what is the use of divine might coins?"</p>

  <p>The divine might coin had a great value. For instance, a single divine might coin could be saved up by a proving godly warrior only after he or she struggled for many years. Luo Zheng became curious about the source of the value of the divine might coin. Why on earth did this piece of black disk have so much value?</p>

  <p>"Hehe..." Master Evil laughed, "I will only tell you after you enter the Floating Island. Now you can still let me keep you in suspense. Actually, almost everyone knows about the usage of the divine might coin. It's not a secret."</p>

  <p>The fact about the divine might coins was already known throughout the whole divine land, so it was hard for Luo Zheng to ask the others. If he didn't even have basic common sense, then his origins would be suspected again.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had tried to keep Luo Zheng in suspense a few times, and Luo Zheng couldn't force him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly slid down at the edge of the pit following the path that was dug out towards the bottom of the pit.</p>

  <p>Relying on his inner world, Luo Zheng could tell the difference between the special mud and ordinary mud. His inner world was like a starving dog.</p>

  <p>Once he got close to that special mud, it could not wait to send out its strong consciousness!</p>

  <p>Devin then followed closely behind Luo Zheng. He wasn't after anything but for the sake of safety. Since he was the one who forthrightly brought Luo Zheng to the Tie Clan, he would definitely help him to the end.</p>

  <p>After some time, Luo Zheng arrived at the bottom of the pit.</p>

  <p>The entire pit was about three thousand feet deep. Surrounding the pit was soft wet earth, and at the bottom was black gangue. The black gangue was very hard that even Luo Zheng could hardly break it.</p>

  <p>As he looked around, his inner world's consciousness didn't give out any ripple of reaction.</p>

  <p>Although he had mentally prepared himself for the outcome, he was still a bit disappointed.</p>

  <p>It was indeed hard to find that peculiar mud. It was already a luck for him to find a piece of it the first time, and the chances of finding it again here were very slim.</p>

  <p>"My family members have been doing their best to find it during this period of time. If they were able to find a piece, they would definitely give it to you, Tianxing. Unfortunately, they didn't," Devin said while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>If Linn heard what her brother had said, she would probably explode in anger. A piece of mud could be exchanged for five hundred divine might coins from Tianxing. The Tie Clan wasn't rich, and five hundred divine might coins was a huge sum of money. How could they give the mud to him for free?</p>

  <p>For others to say these words, they would be seen like they were trying to please Luo Zheng. But it was a different case with Devin's honest personality as he had always been a man of his own word. The Tie Clan really wasn't that successful in digging out the mud and once they had, Devin would surely offer it freely to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. It's already very fortunate for me to be able to find a clue," Luo Zheng responded with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to walk around the bottom of the pit. At the same time he kept paying attention to the movements of his inner world. He would surely know what it meant once it reacted.</p>

  <p>After circling the pit a few times, Luo Zheng asked, "At that time, Linn said that Alfred dug it out from under a big tree. I wonder where the tree was originally located?"</p>

  <p>The place had already been dug out beyond recognition. All the trees had been moved, so he naturally could not see where they were located before.</p>

  <p>"Our clan excavated this place with the tree as the center. Logically, it should be in the middle of the huge pit," Devin answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and walked towards the center of the huge pit. Wandering around for a while, he couldn't help but let out a breath. He wasn't able to detect that type of mud, and didn't know the next time he would encounter it.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't get that mud, he would not be able to condense a Godly Tile. The Primal Chaos Technique would reach its end and becoming a True God would be impossible. How could he achieve his larger ambitions and plans?</p>

  <p>"Did you find anything?" Devin asked in concern.</p>

  <p>A wry smile appeared on Zheng's face as he shook his head. "Well, let's climb up and have a look."</p>

  <p>With nothing left to discover in the pit, Luo Zheng could only once again walk around. He was already clear that the chances of finding the mud outside the pit were much lower.</p>

  <p>Devin was also slightly disappointed. He had obtained the approval from the Tie Clan the time he invited Luo Zheng into the Tie Clan.</p>

  <p>Some members of the Tie Clan might covet the divine might coins, and were strongly opposed to outsiders entering this place, but Devin believed that it would be better to befriend Tianxing than to earn that bit of divine might coins. A clan could not develop without divine might coins, but the divine might coin could not decide everything.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to climb up the side, he suddenly felt a slight tremor in his body.</p>

  <p>His entire body froze on the spot, a strange look flashing through his eyes.</p>

  <p>'It seems to be here...' Luo Zheng thought in his heart.</p>

  <p>The movements within his inner world were rather weak, but he was still able to detect them.</p>

  <p>His inner world's consciousness was not very sure towards this special mud as its reaction was very weak. Yet, it still sent a signal to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing?" Devin asked curiously as he saw Luo Zheng suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and smiled at Devin, asking, "Can I dig here?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, go ahead," Devin uttered and waved his hand. He sincerely hoped that Luo Zheng would find what he was looking for.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached for his sword hilt and pulled his sword fiercely. The Great Weighty Sword appeared in his hand. Twisting it lightly caused the Great Weighty Sword to spin and pierce towards the side of the pit.</p>

  <p>"Plop!"</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword touched the soft soil and the power within was like an invisible ripple, spinning along the soil.</p>

  <p>By the time he withdrew his Great Weighty Sword, a circular passageway about sixty to seventy feet long had appeared in front of him. This passageway seemed to have been carved out of the tip of a sharp knife. It clearly showed Zheng's powerful ability to use strength.</p>

  <p>Without the slightest hesitation, Luo Zheng charged into the passageway in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the passageway, the consciousness in his inner world gradually became clearer making his heart beat faster and faster. It seemed like that kind of special mud was more than just a piece.</p>

  <p>Reaching the end of the passageway, Luo Zheng stabbed out with his sword once again. He was like a mouse completely immersed in digging a long and narrow hole.</p>
