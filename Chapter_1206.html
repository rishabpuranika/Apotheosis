<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1206 Zero-Homers </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Across the great world, many powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were on top of almost everyone. Since when had they ever been looked down upon like this?</p>

  <p>Even though these people seemed to have unfathomable strengths, many of the powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors looked indignant.</p>

  <p>However, the other side showed no interest in messing around with them.</p>

  <p>The flower in Dorothea's eyes slightly rotated before she said in an aloof tone, "They are using the Soul Cores to control the corpses. As long as I disturb the power of the Soul Cores, their souls can all be imprisoned inside the corpses forever. It must be Max's great luck that the god has sent them to us. They can be our baits! Haha, Max's luck truly never fails!"</p>

  <p>When her soft laughter had died down, a wispy pink mist floated out from the flower.</p>

  <p>"Power of fragrance. Spiritual confinement…"</p>

  <p>"Hooo... hooo... hooo..."</p>

  <p>A faint fragrance quickly wafted out from her and trapped many of the powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors inside.</p>

  <p>At that moment, everyone suddenly realized that they couldn't move the corpses anymore!</p>

  <p>"The Soul Core--the Soul Core stopped working! How is this possible!?"</p>

  <p>"The power of the Soul Cores must have been disturbed by that bitch!"</p>

  <p>"I can't leave the mind of this corpse now!"</p>

  <p>Those powerful Soul Sea Realm masters had used the power of the Soul Cores to make the corpses move. Alas, Dorothea seemed to have easily disrupted the power of the Soul Cores!</p>

  <p>This meant that she could easily cut off the connection between the souls of these powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors and the corpses they occupied.</p>

  <p>But they had yet to realize the worst thing that happened. They previously thought that they could just abandon the corpses and leave-- but some of the Soul Sea Realm masters tried doing so, and found that their souls were firmly locked inside the corpses' heads, with no ways to escape.</p>

  <p>"Stop trying, it's useless. A small group of souls at the Fighting Soul Realm won't be able to break free from my spiritual confinement,"</p>

  <p>Dorothea said indifferently, as she seemed to have sensed the Soul Sea Realm masters' movements.</p>

  <p>At that point, even Luo Zheng couldn't move!</p>

  <p>Although he had occupied Brianna's body, which wasn't dead, he had still used the Soul Core to control the body. The Soul Sealing Spell had made it impossible for anyone to forcefully control Brianna's body, so Luo Zheng had no choice but to temporarily control her body with the Soul Core.</p>

  <p>"Now, everyone turn around." Dorothea smiled and walked past them, as all the corpses turned around simultaneously. Now, everyone was under her control.</p>

  <p>"Hmm? Why is there a living body?" Luo Zheng caught Dorothea's attention amidst the crowd of corpses, and she immediately walked towards him.</p>

  <p>"And this body is at the Spirit Supreme Realm…but it's also actually controlled by the Soul Core. How strange!"</p>

  <p>She sized Luo Zheng up and confusion clouded her irises. Of course, she didn't know that Brianna's soul was locked by the Soul Sealing Spell, and Luo Zheng had taken over her body.</p>

  <p>"However, she is so beautiful!" A strange glow flashed in Dorothea's eyes. Then, she suddenly leaned over and kissed Luo Zheng on the cheek. "If I don't need this body later, I will keep you," she said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt nothing towards the kiss, but within the body, Brianna felt goosebumps prickle all over her skin. "That's so gross! Luo Zheng, I'll kill her for that!" In the world within Brianna's body, her thunderous roar together with the crack of thunder and lightning were heard. Brianna's soul was extremely powerful, and Dorothea's actions disgusted her so much that she reacted quite angrily.</p>

  <p>"I can't even move right now and I can't even protect myself. How can I kill her?" Luo Zheng said helplessly.</p>

  <p>No one would've thought that a bunch of creatures had suddenly appeared in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. Those dragon-shaped monsters first showed up, then they met these three mysterious masters…</p>

  <p>What had happened in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land? Were these people here for the Ancestral Dragon Egg as well?</p>

  <p>"Who exactly are they? Do you know them?" Luo Zheng asked. A cold snort passed from Brianna's lips.</p>

  <p>"They are from the Celestial Position. And they are the hunters of the Celestial Position!" Brianna whined.</p>

  <p>"Celestial Position!" Zheng's eyes lit up. This wasn't the first time he had heard about it. The Tower of Sin in the Sea God Continent belonged to the Celestial Position!</p>

  <p>He had passed the test in the Talent Tablet and was even recognized by the Celestial Position back then. However, Luo Zheng still didn't know what the Celestial Position was until now, and what abilities they had.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is the Celestial Position?" Luo Zheng asked again. "You're really curious," Brianna said.</p>

  <p>Then she added, "Although I don't know what they'll feed us to, it's definitely not a good thing. You don't seem to care about this!"</p>

  <p>"Didn't that woman say that she'll spare you?" Luo Zheng smiled. "I would rather die than fall into her hands!" Brianna said angrily.</p>

  <p>Her eyes cast Luo Zheng an incredulous look, as if she couldn't believe he even said that. "The Celestial Position is a group of mavericks. They are also a group of idiots!" Brianna continued.</p>

  <p>"Idiots?" This left Luo Zheng confused. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"The members of the Celestial Position are also known as the Zero-Homers. Strictly speaking, the Celestial Position isn't a race, but a group of super talents from various races who gathered together and formed a group. The world calls them Zero-Homers because they've always been planning to reset the entire universe!" Brianna said flatly.</p>

  <p>Curiosity was written all over Zheng's face. "What do you mean by reset the entire universe?"</p>

  <p>"Destroy the heaven and stop the cycle of reincarnation!" Brianna quickly answered. It was known that the heaven was in constant cycles of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>One cycle took 3.6 billion years, which was also equivalent to an era of the universe.</p>

  <p>Many powerful creatures in the universe wanted to destroy the heaven.</p>

  <p>At the end of each era, a great new world would begin. Thus, it would be a world of chaos for the rule of the heaven!</p>

  <p>If the heaven was destroyed, then the era would come to an end. A new heaven would be formed, and all the entire universe's inferior laws, middle level laws, and superior laws would be reconstructed!</p>

  <p>Older civilizations in the entire universe had undergone the countless cycles of reincarnation--from the endless round of birth and death to shape new ones.</p>

  <p>However, the Celestial Position was quite strange. Their goal was not only to destroy the heaven, but also to stop the cycle of reincarnation and put it to an end.</p>

  <p>"If they end the cycle of reincarnation, and if there is no new heaven created, then…" Luo Zheng was even more curious about the consequence.</p>

  <p>"Then the entire universe will become a death land. No living beings will be born, no living beings will die, and there will be no wars. Everything will return to zero," Brianna smiled lightly and said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was speechless. "What's the point of this?"</p>

  <p>"They think it's meaningful, so they're a bunch of idiots. Moreover, they're very powerful idiots," Brianna said helplessly. "Just now, that woman has affected the power of the Soul Cores, but I can help restore it. Later I will find a chance to recover it, and you can slip away."</p>

  <p>"But they…" All of the top masters of the four divine kingdoms were under the woman's control, the four rulers also included.</p>

  <p>"Who cares if they die or not," Brianna snapped.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows creased together. Indeed, it was none of Zheng's or Brianna's business. Luo Zheng didn't need to help the four divine kingdoms. But if he had the chance to save their lives, then he would not sit idly!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the corpses under Dorothea's control advanced slowly behind her, just like wooden zombies.</p>

  <p>The powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors remained trapped and were still inside the corpses' minds. However, they could still observe their surroundings. As they continued to move forward, dragon-shaped monsters rushed out from various directions.</p>

  <p>Dorothea continued walking forward as if nothing had happened. Just as the dragon-shaped monsters were about to pounce on her, the flower in her eyes gently rotated, and a faint fragrance wafted out. The dragon-shaped monsters immediately became dizzy, as if they had gotten drunk.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they lost their strength and slumped to the ground.</p>

  <p>After a few more moments of slow progress, they passed by the Jade Lake and continued their way towards the center of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Loud, booming sounds were heard from a distance not far away. The entire sacred place shook vehemently like boiling pot of porridge.</p>
