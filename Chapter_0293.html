<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Wurth took the heavenly essences from Luo Zheng and delicately stuffed them into a beautiful emerald ring which was carefully on the ring finger of his left hand. It was a space ring.</p>

  <p>When it was done, Wurth sighed and spoke out, "There will be an uproar if so many heavenly essences are sold in the Imperial Capital."</p>

  <p>Heavenly essence was precious and immensely valuable because it could be applied to the weapons directly.</p>

  <p>For example, a top-grade spiritual weapon could have qualitative changes if enough heavenly essences were applied to it. There was even a possibility of producing a fairy weapon from it.</p>

  <p>Although considerable time and effort was required and lots of heavenly essences were consumed, the fairy weapon deserved it. Its holder would make huge profits even after the making costs were taken into account.</p>

  <p>That explained why the heavenly essence was so valuable.</p>

  <p>Wurth stopped practicing his martial arts and took off his heavy load suit. They returned to the main peak where they were to meet Sean and Nory.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng and Wurth, I was looking for you," said Nory. He flashed a warm smile at them.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" asked Luo Zheng. He felt confused.</p>

  <p>Wurth patted Luo Zheng on his shoulder as he smiled, "Oh so, have you forgotten? A few days ago Nory very clearly mentioned that a party would be held among his clan men. He invited us to this party," Wurth replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng came from a humble clan which was even inferior to Mo Clan.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had very little knowledge about the great noble clans, their conventions or even norms.</p>

  <p>However, Wurth had a better understanding of everything, and simply sympathized with Nory who felt helpless and sad living under the burden of a noble clan's name.</p>

  <p>"I have been quite busy recently and almost forgot about this gathering. I must apologise. Will the party be held today?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nory nodded and answered, "Yes, today is the day."</p>

  <p>They had made a promise to attend the party. So, they followed Nory and went to his house.</p>

  <p>The Mo Clan, living in the northern part of the city, was commonly considered a declining one among the other clans of various sizes.</p>

  <p>The hereditary system, in place, ensured that the descendants of a declining family could still hold onto the same title or rank despite the circumstance.</p>

  <p>However, despite all of this, some clans remained unlucky, and disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>For instance, once upon a time there was a powerful noble clan called Xiao Clan. Although it wasn't among the most ancient clans, in fact it was actually better and more powerful than the seven noble clans, since a galaxy of talents came from its descendants. This great clan held important posts both in the imperial army and in the Burning Sky Empire. Besides, some of them were even unprecedented masters of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Once it became powerful and influential, their ambition too began to swell. Their people were busy in expanding the territory, contending for power and profits. There was a time when nobody could challenge them both in and out of the court.</p>

  <p>Even members from the seven noble clans had to bow and show their respect to this expanding and powerful clan.</p>

  <p>However, sooner than later the circumstances changed and the Xiao Clan was accused of conspiring against the royal family, which changed their fate forever. The whole Xiao Clan was destroyed and almost all of its people were executed within days of the accusation. Despite a few people surviving, the Xiao Clan could never recover from the disaster.</p>

  <p>The blow was too strong.</p>

  <p>This tragedy served as a warning for everybody to whom privileges and power of noble clans were given by the emperor. He could withdraw these opportunities as fast as he had granted them when the situation arose.</p>

  <p>The Mo family in the northern part of the city too had declined rapidly in the recent years, and no talents had come from this family. They would be deprived of their privileges and titles very soon if their situation didn't improve or they didn't find other powerful noble clans to live on.</p>

  <p>A broad street stretched out in the northern part of the Imperial Capital and at the end of it stood a tall door almost 10 meters high. The gigantic door was painted red, two giant bronze lions were lying on their stomaches while appearing threatening and dangerous.</p>

  <p>Those regular citizens living in the Imperial Capital could only imagine how wealthy those noble clans were, even the declining clans were beyond their reach.</p>

  <p>Nory took Luo Zheng, Wurth and Sean through this grand door to the other world of cheer and luxurious indulgences.</p>

  <p>The Mo family's mansion was spotlessly clean and was permeated with a jubilant atmosphere owing to the party and the never-ending line of arriving guests.</p>

  <p>Four carp lanterns hung on the door. The bronze had been cleansed. A butler and two servants were standing before the gate, welcoming guests courteously.</p>

  <p>The butler had been repeating the same action of smiling and bowing for several hours with unwavering enthusiasm. All of the guests were respected and esteemed members of the society. The butler had to make sure that they were satisfied with the service. So, he worked hard to please everyone. The smile on his face was professional and his manners were perfect.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw Nory and his group, his behaviour suddenly changed. His fake smile disappeared, and instead he wore an arrogant and scornful look. "Young master, why are you back?"</p>

  <p>Nory too evidently never liked this butler. Since his mother died, this mansion was no longer his home. In response to the butler's cold question, Nory answered, "What's wrong? So are you telling me that I shouldn't come back home today?"</p>

  <p>The butler shook his head and responded, "You really misunderstood what I was saying. However, you're an outer disciple of the Cloud Sect now. Whether you come back home or not isn't important any more. Ha-ha," the butler chuckled nervously.</p>

  <p>The butler emphasized on the words "outer disciple". He actually meant that even though the Mo Family was declining, they still didn't think highly of any outer disciple of the Cloud Sect or care. Besides, he warned that Nory would be a big fool to think that his position at the Mo Family had changed even the slightest bit.</p>
