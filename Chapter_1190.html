  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone had gotten used to Luo Zheng's lanky figure. It was awkward for them to watch Luo Luo Zheng as he took on the tall and sturdy body of the corpse.</p>

  <p>Randy, Fiona, and Callan were some of the few people who looked at Luo Luo Zheng and began to grin.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he casually took a few steps forward. It hadn't taken him long to freely control this corpse.</p>

  <p>But all wasn't smooth. He suddenly felt a wave of pressure on his body.</p>

  <p>A red ripple spread out of nowhere in the empty mind of the corpse. The surroundings in his mind turned blood-red. The pressure wasn't from the outside world but emanated from the corpse itself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had gained control of the corpse through the Soul Core. But now, he found that he couldn't control it at all. It waddled towards the stone pillar as Luo Luo Zheng struggled and failed to control it.</p>

  <p>'Here comes the question!' Luo Luo Zheng became cautious.</p>

  <p>He had previously seen War King Wind and Scott go through this process. They had not been able to resist the orders of the young girl in the stone pillar and couldn't help but walk involuntarily towards the pillar.</p>

  <p>But this wasn't what worried Luo Luo Zheng. The probability that he might not be able to say the corpse's name when questioned posed a greater worry for him.</p>

  <p>'Federico Feng?' Luo Luo Zheng repeated the name in his heart.</p>

  <p>He felt the corpse stagger all the way and fall to its knees with a thud in front of the stone pillar. At the same time, he felt the blood-red ripple in his mind grow stronger and stronger. He knew that it was this blood-red ripple that completely isolated Luo Zheng's soul from the corpse.</p>

  <p>In this moment, Luo Luo Zheng felt everything become distant from him.</p>

  <p>Someone seemed to be talking to Luo Luo Zheng, but he couldn't hear a single word.</p>

  <p>The sound seemed to be coming from the sky, soft and harsh.</p>

  <p>His thoughts had become a mess.</p>

  <p>"Answer me! Your name!" the young girl's voice came from the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>"My name? My name?" Through all the mental chaos, Luo Luo Zheng could not remember the name of this corpse.</p>

  <p>'It's very strange! I can't remember what this corpse is called at all. I clearly remembered it a moment ago!' Luo Luo Zheng thought dejectedly. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't recall anything about this corpse.</p>

  <p>"Tell me your name, or I'll-" The young girl's voice was clear, and Luo Luo Zheng could hear every word she said.</p>

  <p>If he could not remember the name, he would be kicked out of this corpse's mind. Luo Luo Zheng had seen how War King Wind and Scott had bounced back from the bodies they had planned to occupy because they had failed to remember the corpses' names. But the more he became anxious, the less likely it was that anything would come to his mind. It was as if the name had been completely erased from his memory.</p>

  <p>'Name.. What's the name?'</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng searched frantically for the name in his mind, his gaze penetrated the red ripples and landed on the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>'Name, the letters!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had applied a special words memorizing method, disassembled the name of the corpse, and carved the letters on the stone pillar. As long as he restored the name using the letters, he would be able to get the name.</p>

  <p>'F-E-D- E?' Luo Luo Zheng looked at the letters on the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Zheng's thoughts had fallen into chaos, but the young girl in the stone pillar only affected a part of his mind, not all of it.</p>

  <p>According to the letters that Luo Luo Zheng had left on the stone pillar, it wasn't that difficult to retrieve the name.</p>

  <p>'The first name is Federico!'</p>

  <p>He continued to work on the letters. 'F-E- N- G-'</p>

  <p>'The last name is Feng!'</p>

  <p>It was true that he had spelled out the name, but right now, Luo Luo Zheng had a very strange feeling about these two words.</p>

  <p>The words Federico Feng were very common words, but he suddenly realized that he couldn't recognize them at all. These two words, had, for some strange reason, become incomparably foreign to Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>This was weird and troubled Luo Luo Zheng greatly.</p>

  <p>He had obtained the words Federico Feng through a special words memorizing method, but he was unfamiliar with the words he had worked out and could not recognize them. Luo Luo Zheng felt helpless.</p>

  <p>The red ripple spread through his mind faster than Luo Luo Zheng could react and quickly, too quickly, his soul was forced out of the corpse.</p>

  <p>Federico's corpse staggered back to the coffin and slowly lay down.</p>

  <p>The collective hope of the others plummeted as they beheld this scene. It was obvious to them that Luo Luo Zheng had failed to fight the young girl's will.</p>

  <p>"How do you feel?" Turner asked, smiling. He had expected this.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chuckled and said, "I've already spelled these two words out. I know that the owner of this corpse is called Federico Feng."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Everyone's eyes lit up as they heard what Luo Luo Zheng had to say. Did this mean Luo Zheng's method had worked?</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng shrugged and said, "It's useless even if I have them spelled out.</p>

  <p>The will of the young girl in the pillar is irresistible. I guess there's only one way to successfully pronounce the corpse's name."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" War King Wind asked.</p>

  <p>"Instinct. Only by relying on instinct can we pronounce a corpse's name.</p>

  <p>It's actually impossible for us, the occupants of their bodies, to do so,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>From the time of one's birth till death, the only thing that remained unchanged was one's name. Unless one became an idiot, no one would ever forget their own name. It almost became an instinct for anyone to pronounce their own name. That was why some people had failed to pronounce the corpses' names in front of the girl in the stone pillar. They had given her their own names instead.</p>

  <p>Only by relying on one's own instincts could one get rid of chaotic thoughts. The problem, however, was that it was extremely difficult to accomplish this.</p>

  <p>It was probably impossible for a normal person to do this.</p>

  <p>Unless the person was schizophrenic and a part of the person's mind fantasized day and night that he was someone else. If this went on, the person would be no different from a lunatic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's analysis made sense to everyone. War King Wind's success from many years ago could probably only be attributed to luck.</p>

  <p>"But it looks like we still failed this time," Turner said gloomily.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of exploring the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land far surpassed that of the other three secret lands. Without the help of the most powerful corpses, they wouldn't be able to take out the Ancestral Dragon Egg. They were still unable to occupy the bodies of the corpses on the thirteenth floor. And this meant that it was impossible for them to obtain anything good from the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>But before they could do anything, Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said, "Since I can't occupy the corpses that are in these coffins, I can change the target."</p>

  <p>"Change the target? Do you mean the corpses on the twelfth floor?" War King Wind asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng kept smiling, his gaze flitting before landing on the young girl within the stone pillar. He did not know what her cultivation level was, but from the domineering Mu Ning that her body was emitting, Luo Luo Zheng could tell that she was definitely much stronger than the other super powerful beings on the thirteenth floor.</p>

  <p>The powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm were surprised as they saw Luo Zheng's gaze. One of them said, "This girl? is a master at the Spirit Supreme Realm! She is even stronger than Master Derek. How could one take over her corpse? And it is unclear whether she is dead or not!"</p>

  <p>Spirit Supreme Realm!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, the Life and Death Realm was just the threshold, while the Soul Sea Realm was just a beginning level. The Spirit Supreme Realm warriors formed the real backbone of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Master Derek that the Soul Sea Realm master had mentioned referred to the white-browed Taoist who should also be at the Spirit Supreme Realm. And Immortal Mist should be at the Spirit Supreme Realm, too.</p>

  <p>But what about Yolande? Although Yolande's cultivation level was not high, she had a million duplicates. Her strength probably far surpassed the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>And the more powerful beings were beyond Luo Zheng's knowledge. Even someone at the Spirit Supreme Realm would be enough to make Luo Luo Zheng look up to him.</p>

  <p>Thus, once he had heard what the Soul Sea Realm master had to say, Luo Luo Zheng became even more interested in the girl in the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>"Forget about whether the girl in the pillar is dead or not. First of all, there's no way to undo the chains, or to break the crystal coffin she is in.</p>

  <p>To control her body is completely impossible," Turner said.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng merely smirked and returned to Federico's coffin. He stretched out his hand and took out a small space ring.</p>

  <p>When the many powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm saw this, they realized what Luo Luo Zheng wanted to do. Their eyes immediately lit up with surprise.</p>

  <p>Fiona and Randy also came to understand Luo Zheng's intentions. Even Callan, who had always been slow in thinking, said, "That's right! You can open this crystal coffin with the Black Star pickaxe!"</p>
