<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Driven by rage, Romeo attacked with his greatest momentum. He went all out with every strike, showing no mercy to who he was going against.</p>

  <p>Just then, the bamboo sword in his hand morphed into rays of green sword radiance and swept up intensely towards Desmund.</p>

  <p>Desmund had escaped passively all the way. He wanted to fight back occasionally, which only invited even more ferocious suppression from Romeo.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>The bamboo sword, which seemed to be several thousand feet long, hit on the saber several times, leaving deafening clanging noises in the background.</p>

  <p>As Desmund retreated, he warded off dozens of strikes in panic, and finally exposed a serious weakness.</p>

  <p>Romeo's eyes began to twinkle. He noticed the weakness and swung his sword towards Desmund.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As he looked around and saw that there was no place to dodge, the golden light all over his body began to glow. He planned to withstand the blow with his Yellow Emperor Wild Body.</p>

  <p>But when the seemingly harmless bamboo sword collided with his back, only then did he realize how naive he was.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Within minutes, a sharp force burst from the bamboo sword, shattering the golden light on the surface of Desmund's body into pieces.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, he felt a chill go up his right arm, and just like that, his thousand-foot long arm was detached from his body.</p>

  <p>With his arm cut off, the Wild God Power from the arm began to quickly dissipate. As it happened, the arm shrank so rapidly that people didn't know where it went.</p>

  <p>"I admit defeat! I surrender!" Desmund shouted, desperate.</p>

  <p>He tossed aside the saber and knelt down on the ground, a bang echoing from his heavy knees. Suddenly, two big holes appeared on the ground under his knees.</p>

  <p>He was smart, and if he didn't admit defeat, he would probably be killed by Romeo like Monty.</p>

  <p>But even though Desmund already admitted defeat, Romeo didn't plan to show any mercy to him.</p>

  <p>As his blood boiled, all Romeo wanted to do was kill his enemy. But just as the sword came down towards Desmund's head, he found himself unable to move.</p>

  <p>Just then, Giacomo, who managed to grow as big as Romeo, appeared behind him without him knowing. Giacomo gently clamped the sword between his two fingers.</p>

  <p>"Come back," he gestured towards Romeo. "He has already admitted defeat. You've already won."</p>

  <p>Although nobody would be held responsible for the life or death in the battle ring, Desmund had already knelt down and surrendered.</p>

  <p>If Romeo were to take his life, it would ultimately lead to a horrible backlash from the Yellow Emperor race. As everyone knew, this was the last thing the Nine Li race would want to see.</p>

  <p>Before setting off, Adele had received an order from her father, Ramzi.</p>

  <p>"Try not to have conflict with the Yellow Emperor race," his father instructed. "Even if you lose, it wouldn't matter."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of those exiles, the Sky South Bone Tower was no longer important. The most important thing was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng knew the way out of the prison.</p>

  <p>The real reason why they arranged Luo Zheng to go with Adele during battle was only to give him opportunity to practice.</p>

  <p>Romeo gradually calmed down. He snorted at Desmund, who seemed to be trembling in fear. "You got lucky this time!"</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he followed Giacomo back. At the same time, Desmund was able to retrieve his broken arm, and found himself returning to the place where the Yellow Emperor members gathered.</p>

  <p>The third round ended with Romeo's victory.</p>

  <p>Luckily for them, the Nine Li race finally saved their reputation with Romeo's performance.</p>

  <p>While the warriors of the Yellow Emperor race all had cautious expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Romeo's strength is indeed... extraordinary," a black-faced elder pointed out.</p>

  <p>Another elder seemed a little puzzled. "Romeo's strength is good, but in the Immemorial Wilderness, there is no way he could beat three Wild Gods all alone." He explained, "Even if he really defeated Bilaal and the other two Wild Gods with him, he wouldn't be able to kill all three of them. None of them were ever able to return, so this is absurd."</p>

  <p>"There must be something else then, something we don't know," the black faced elder responded, frowning and looking down at the floor.</p>

  <p>With a pitiful smile, Lancelot continued, "No matter if there are hidden facts, or he is as powerful as he presents himself to be, we shall resume with our original plan." He turned to Lisa and gave her a signal, "Lisa, you go to fight. If Lisa is defeated, Jerome will go."</p>

  <p>Lisa Xia was Jerome Xia's young sister and they were only second to David in the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Before David rose up, Lisa Xia and Jerome Xia had always been the key disciples in the Yellow Emperor race. However, once David appeared, even Lisa Xia and Jerome Xia were overshadowed by him.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Lancelot, as long as David was there with them, the Yellow Emperor race had nothing to worry about.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race was determined to take over the Sky South Bone Tower!</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>A woman in green bowed to Lancelot. This was Lisa Xia.</p>

  <p>"Lisa, please be careful," Jerome whispered from behind her.</p>

  <p>The fact that Desmund didn't even have the strength to fight back when fighting Romeo gave Jerome Xia the jitters. The last thing he wanted was to see his sister hurt.</p>

  <p>"I know," she replied.</p>

  <p>"If you find yourself no match for him, just throw in the towel," Jerome added.</p>

  <p>"Sizz..."</p>

  <p>David, who was previously sleeping on the ground, let out a howling laugh. "Jerome, you are such a coward, aren't you? What are you even thinking? Throwing in the towel even before the battle starts?"</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business." snapped Jerome.</p>

  <p>This wasn't new, though. A handful of people from the Yellow Emperor race didn't like David's arrogance. However, David was ridiculously strong, so they could only give in to him.</p>

  <p id="top_16">Jerome Xia, however, never acted nicely towards David.</p>

  <p>David was used to this, and he never got angry about it. Instead, he chuckled and said, "I hope you won't ask me to save you in the end."</p>

  <p>After saying that, he turned over and continued his sleep on the ground.</p>

  <p>In the fourth round, Romeo still represented the Nine Li race to fight.</p>

  <p>In the past three months, Romeo's cultivation had improved a lot in the Cave of Wildness. But no matter how much he trained, there was still a very visible gap between his strength and Elsa's.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, he was more powerful than Desmund, but the gaps in their strength weren't so remarkable. The only reason Desmund failed was because he panicked which led to his failure to resist Romeo's attacks...</p>

  <p>While Lisa Xia's strength was far more powerful than that of Desmund.</p>

  <p>Head on with Romeo's crazy attack, she drew back tactically, her parries steady and sure. For some reason, there was no trace of panic in her eyes.</p>

  <p>As Romeo's desperate attacks drained all of his energy, Lisa Xia saw this as the perfect time to take initiative. The thin black sword in her hand was like a spiritual snake without bones as it formed a cage, firmly trapping Romeo within it.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Romeo was like a trapped beast, unable to get out of her trap no matter how hard he tried.</p>

  <p>"Romeo is going to lose," Luo Zheng exclaimed as he watched the two giants fight. "He's not a match for the woman in green."</p>

  <p>"Lisa! She's so powerful!" said Elsa, blinking her eyes multiple times.</p>

  <p>She couldn't believe what she was seeing.</p>

  <p>When Adele, Giacomo, Erik saw the strength that Lisa Xia was displaying, their faces grew gloomy.</p>

  <p>How could they have expected the Wild Gods in the young generation of the Yellow Emperor race would grow so quickly?</p>

  <p>However, looking at the way they arranged their warriors to fight, it was obvious that Lisa Xia was not the strongest warrior they had. However, the strength she had shown had left Romeo far behind already.</p>

  <p>Even Elsa could not surely take her down. Moreover, the Yellow Emperor race still had two warriors that hadn't fought yet. Could the Nine Li race only count on Luo Zheng? Adele thought.</p>

  <p>In deep thought, Adele silently glanced at Luo Zheng who stood next to her. At this time, Giacomo's and Erik's gazes also fell flatly on Luo Zheng. It seemed as if the elders shared the same thought as they had bitter smiles plastered across their faces.</p>
