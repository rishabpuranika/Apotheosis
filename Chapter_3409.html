<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the middle of the ring-shaped mountain range, some creatures had gathered in the arrays surrounding the main peak.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to risk their lives, they didn't dare step outside of the arrays.</p>

  <p>At least within the arrays, they could seek some shelter from the terrible hurricane.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the center of the main peak exploded in a cloud of smoke and dust.</p>

  <p>The creatures huddled in the arrays widened their eyes in shock.</p>

  <p>"What happened in the main peak?"</p>

  <p>"Such strength!"</p>

  <p>"It cracks! It cracks! The main peak is about to collapse!"</p>

  <p>When the dust cleared, they saw a huge crack in the middle of the main peak, and it was growing rapidly.</p>

  <p>The entire ring-shaped mountain range quaked as the cracks crawled towards its edges.</p>

  <p>The main peak, which was up to a million feet high, slowly began to tilt to one side. The tip of the peak suddenly broke off, crashing into the east side of the ring-shaped mountain range, destroying that as well.</p>

  <p>The creatures who were gathered in the arrays stood motionless before the scene that was unfolding, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Only the other half of the main peak was left, rendering the once towering mountain now an almost flattened plain!</p>

  <p>Naturally, the bystanders were stunned.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits lurking in the upper part of the main peak began to stir as they sensed this change.</p>

  <p>While they didn't know what was going on exactly, they couldn't calm down until the mother comforted them.</p>

  <p>"Is this your plan?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits asked pointedly.</p>

  <p>The giant eye floating inside the main peak began to emanate a depressed aura. It had just wanted the foolish young talents to take the bait. It had never expected that the creatures would not climb up the stairs-- instead, they had sliced off the main peak!</p>

  <p>"Don't panic! They have to come inside if they want to take the Chaotic Source Spirits!" The giant eye reassured the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits through its consciousness.</p>

  <p>After the collapse of the main peak, the force of fear that restrained people also disappeared.</p>

  <p>All the races grew even more cautious. Besides, they couldn't lower their guard against the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood in front of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the members of the Snake Goddess race. In his inner world, the Eye of Will, the Strength God Totem and that Civilization Artifact quietly floated.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Khalid, Mount and Mya didn't plan to take any action.</p>

  <p>Killing the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace was important to them, but getting enough Chaotic Source Spirits for the Chaotic Source Reinforcement was more important at the moment.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew what was lurking in the main peak. But they knew that they needed to join forces with everyone in order to defeat it first.</p>

  <p>Everyone seemed to be lost in their own thoughts, trying to figure out what to do next.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Evil God was the calmest. With a mischievous smile creeping around his lips, he broke the ice. "The main peak has collapsed now. What are you so worried about?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the others looked at him, speechless.</p>

  <p>Hamzah from the Separate Abyss race mocked bitterly in his heart. 'He's talking nonsense. He's the biggest threat to us now.'</p>

  <p>All the others silently shared the sentiments. They were afraid this lunatic would stab them in the back.</p>

  <p>"Let's go, Zheng," Yan suddenly said, as she shot the Evil God a cold glance.</p>

  <p>She had always hated that guy.</p>

  <p>Compared to the others, Yan was not that afraid of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and gestured to the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace, telling them to fly down from the top of the broken mountain.</p>

  <p>As the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill took the lead, members of other small forces also followed closely behind. Then the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race and the Separate Abyss race followed on their heels.</p>

  <p>The last few races picked up the pace. No one was willing to stay with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God kept sitting there, unmoving.</p>

  <p>However, the Chaotic Source Reinforcement also mattered to him. He might've been insane, but he was no idiot.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be late for him to deal with them after he obtained enough Chaotic Source Spirits...</p>

  <p>As soon as the main peak fell, the races who had taken shelter in the arrays slowly started coming out, one after the other. Since the Chaotic Source Spirits were hidden in the main peak, now was their chance to find some.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the foot of the main peak, Zheng announced, "We won't go in. We can attack it from the outside."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, his eyes narrowed slightly. Activating the Authentic Visual World of the Eye of Will, he saw all the flaws on the main peak, as clear as day.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Waving the Snow Sword lightly, he shot out a sword radiance to chop at the main peak's flaws.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a large crack ripped through a corner of the main peak, shattering boulders as it went.</p>

  <p>However, the main peak was extremely huge. Although there were many flaws, they were not concentrated to one area; even if Zheng could see and cut the flaws, it'd take him an eternity before he destroyed them all.</p>

  <p>Yan pressed her hands together, seemingly in prayer. Then, the blood-red shadow of the Snake Goddess appeared behind her.</p>

  <p>The hands of the shadow of Snake Goddess stretched out, sending out countless streaks of pure red energy. Every time a streak of energy whipped downwards, it'd destroy multitudes of rocks in the peak.</p>

  <p>'Yan isn't relying on any Other Shore Token, ' Zheng pondered in awe.</p>

  <p>'Instead, she summoned the shadow of the Snake Goddess, which could burst out over a thousand divine megatons of force!' He nodded in approval.</p>

  <p>Yan had grown stronger than he expected in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Zheng suspected that she might have fused with a good Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>That was why she had no intention of giving in when facing the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the members of the Snake Goddess race launched themselves into the air and activated their Other Shore Tokens, casting terrifying energy on the main peak one after another.</p>

  <p>Behind them, many races like the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, the Separate Abyss race and the Celestial Wolf race also joined in the attack.</p>

  <p>In order to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits, they had all unanimously decided to cast aside their differences.</p>

  <p>That giant eye in the main peak was distressed by this scene.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say they would come in anyway?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits complained.</p>

  <p>"Let the Chaotic Source Spirits fight against them for a bit," the giant eye advised.</p>

  <p>"I've already sent them there. Although we can hold them off for a while, we will eventually be exhausted..." the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirit said dejectedly.</p>

  <p>The half peak that had fallen to the ground was like a dead giant, suffering the attacks of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Each stream of energy ruthlessly ripped open a piece of flesh of the giant.</p>

  <p>However, as the Chaotic Source Spirits cruised inside the body of the peak, suddenly the entire main peak solidified into a smooth, shiny surface with no imperfections-- not even a hairline crack.</p>

  <p>"It's the Chaotic Source Spirits!"</p>

  <p>"They are in the rocks!"</p>

  <p>"Dig them out!"</p>

  <p>People cried out excitedly. They had all dug out several Chaotic Source Spirits before, so this was like a beacon of hope to them. Together, they attacked the rocks more fiercely.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With so many people joining hands, an extremely terrifying amount of force was unleashed onto the peak.</p>

  <p>Having been attacked mercilessly, the Chaotic Source Spirits lurking in the mountain quickly fell into a state of exhaustion. The originally solid mountain body began to buckle and crack again.</p>

  <p>Yan was the quickest of them to notice. The moment she discovered a crack, she channeled the red threads of energy from the arms of the shadow of Snake Goddess to get into the crack. With a flick of her wrist, she pulled out more than a hundred Chaotic Source Spirits!</p>
