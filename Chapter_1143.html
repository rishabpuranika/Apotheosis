</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng came out of the pyramid, he was preparing to set off for the 30th floor.</p>

  <p>Every time Luo Luo Zheng stepped out, he would find a large crowd gathering and discussing things. It was interesting? Luo Luo Zheng wondered why they didn't seize the opportunity to explore the pyramid. What were they all doing there?</p>

  <p>Eventually, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that they were all gathering to trade for ores.</p>

  <p>Although it was unknown where the large tree sucked the ores from, those ores found in the pyramid were all unique. Through an exchange, the warriors could pick out what they needed.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng prepared to climb up, an idea dawned on him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng walked over to the group, all the people suddenly fell silent.</p>

  <p>Having been a sensation with his previous performance, he certainly left a deep impression on the divine-level talents of the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Unbothered by their reaction, he brought out some ores from his space ring and piled them up on the ground. "Whoever has life stones can exchange them for my ores."</p>

  <p>Many of these divine-level talents had explored the floors above the 20th. But at most, they could only reach the 26th floor. None of them were strong enough to break the hard leaves further up, so they never brought back any ores from the higher floors.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng wandered the 29th floor, apart from the life stones, he found some other ores of good shapes and beautiful colors? he took those he could with him in his space ring.</p>

  <p>With the help of the pickax, which was a sacred weapon, and some power of the dragon scales, digging the ores out wasn't a particularly difficult task for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The higher the floor he reached, the better the ores he could find. But most of them wouldn't be of any real use to Luo Luo Zheng. There were some rare ores among them, with the value not less than that of life stones.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise how many of the warriors' eyes immediately lit up with excitement the minute Luo Luo Zheng threw out the stones he found in the pyramid.</p>

  <p>Some of the ores were exactly what they needed.</p>

  <p>The pile of ores were undoubtedly attractive. One of the warriors even pointed to the pile and offered, "I don't have any life stones. Name a price for this jade green ore. I can buy it with my supreme life vitality crystals."</p>

  <p>These divine-level talents came from fifth-grade noble clans. There was no doubt that all of them were extremely rich. While they didn't have any life stones, they did have more than enough supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Luo Luo Zheng declined, "My ores are not for sale. If you want anything, you need to bring me life stones in exchange for it."</p>

  <p>Disbelief painted the warrior's face upon hearing Luo Zheng's words. The next moment, he shouted out, "Two hundred supreme life vitality crystals!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't even bat an eyelid. He didn't want to explain his words to him twice.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred?three hundred supreme life vitality crystals." As the martial artist saw Luo Zheng's indifference, he felt rather humiliated, which pushed him to increase the price by half.</p>

  <p>Still, the expression on Luo Zheng's face remained the same.</p>

  <p>"Four hundred!" the warrior increased the price by another hundred. In truth, the price of the turquoise was worth around five hundred supreme life vitality crystals in the market. Since this was where the ores originated, the turquoise would naturally cost much less than in the market.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was unmoved. He looked at the group and said, "I don't have much time. If anyone has life stones, you can trade them for something I have."</p>

  <p>"Kid, what do you mean? The price I offered isn't low!" The prospective buyer's expression significantly darkened after Luo Zheng's remark. Realizing that he had been completely ignored by the boy, his face turned red out of rage. Young martial artists at his age cared too much about their self-pride. Being ignored by others was something intolerable for such people.</p>

  <p>Hearing the martial artist's question, Luo Luo Zheng smiled with derision. Staring at the man, his frustration grew.</p>

  <p>"Was I not clear enough? I said, only for trade, not for sale! I'll say it again. If you want it, then give me life stones in return! If you have no life stones, please don't mess around."</p>

  <p>It was only then that the warrior realized that the kid in front of him was someone who even a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm didn't dare to provoke. How could a mere warrior like him dare to push him further?</p>

  <p>His face turned pale with embarrassment at Luo Zheng's words. In the end, he disgracefully retreated to the side.</p>

  <p>Just as he exited, another one said to Luo Luo Zheng, "I have ten life stones. I want to exchange them for the Green Mist Stone. How about it?"</p>

  <p>The surface of the green ore at Luo Zheng's feet looked rather transparent, but if one examined closely, one would find that its center looked fuzzy and misty.</p>

  <p>With a light smile, Luo Luo Zheng agreed, "Okay, it's a deal!"</p>

  <p>After a light tap of his finger, the Green Mist Stone flew toward the warrior.</p>

  <p>As long as he knew that the warrior wouldn't go back on his word, Luo Luo Zheng could rest easy. As for whether or not the ten life stones were a worthy trade for the Green Mist Stone? that was not Luo Zheng's concern in the least.</p>

  <p>The warrior knew full well how powerful Luo Luo Zheng was, so how would he dare fool him? In an instant, he took out ten life stones and gave them to Luo Luo Zheng. The warrior was overjoyed? clearly, he had made a good bargain.</p>

  <p>When some of the martial artists saw this, they secretly cursed Luo Luo Zheng for his idiocy. He was on a huge losing end of the deal, but no one would go tell him the truth.</p>

  <p>"Anyone else who possesses the life stone can trade with me." Seeing the others' expressions, Luo Luo Zheng could tell what they were thinking. But the life stones were his priority? he was willing to get as many as he could, no matter the cost.</p>

  <p>Seeing how easy the transaction went, some of the warriors were also tempted. Although there weren't many life stones within the range they had explored, a few warriors managed to find some. One of the warriors pointed at the golden ore at Luo Zheng's feet and said, "I have six life stones, can I exchange these for the golden one?"</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to nod his head in agreement, a crisp voice cut through, "Six life stones for pure gold?how shrewd you are at this business!"</p>

  <p>It was Camilla, who had just come out from the light circle. It was a shock to see Luo Luo Zheng so casually throw a pile of ores on the ground in exchange for mere life stones.</p>

  <p>Amongst the pile of ores from Luo Luo Zheng, the gold ore had the highest value.</p>

  <p>Such a large piece of gold could sell for at least 4000 supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>The face of the warrior who made the offer sank upon hearing Camilla's interjection.</p>

  <p>However, Camilla didn't show the slightest hint of fear. Instead, she coldly returned, "What? You want to pick a fight? Tianxing can stab you to death with just a single finger! If you want to exchange this for pure gold, you have to take out at least eighty life stones!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Camilla use him to threaten the warrior so openly, Luo Zheng's face turned helpless. He couldn't expect the warrior to bring out 80 life stones. Even he only had six, to save Yudie's life, however, he wouldn't hesitate to accept the offer.</p>

  <p>In return, the warrior could only grit his teeth and say, "I don't have that many life stones! I only have twelve in my hand!"</p>

  <p>"You have twelve, yet you only prepared to take out six to exchange for pure gold. You wanted to take advantage of the fact that Tianxing isn't familiar with these ores, didn't you? Well, do you want this one? It's a Golden Warm Stone." Bending over and picking up a slender golden ore, Camilla waved it at the warrior.</p>

  <p>With his trick so easily seen through, the warrior was humiliated. Before he could say a word, she said, "How about this? three thousand and five hundred supreme life vitality crystals plus the twelve life stones in your hands for the Golden Warm Stone! No other price!"</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>He could have obtained the pure gold with only six life stones, but this woman messed it all up for him. How could he not be frustrated? And he did intend to use the remaining six life stones to exchange for the Golden Warm Stone?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he couldn't do anything to Camilla.</p>

  <p>Still, as he calculated 3500 supreme life vitality crystals, plus the 12 life stones for the Golden Warm Stone, he couldn't deny that there was a chance of profit margin in the deal. In the end, he gritted his teeth and said, "Okay, deal!"</p>

  <p>After the deal was sealed, Luo Luo Zheng took the twelve life stones from her hands, leaving the life vitality crystals. "Thank you. This is your reward, I don't need them?"</p>

  <p>"How stupid!"</p>

  <p>Stuffing the supreme life vitality crystals in Luo Zheng's hands, she continued,</p>

  <p>"Besides trading your ores for life stones, you can also use supreme life vitality crystals to buy life stones from others. They're usually found in clusters. There are at least eight or ten of them in discovery, rarely six in a cluster. He said that he had six of them so obviously he hid some from you."</p>

  <p>Camilla's analysis left Luo Luo Zheng rather stunned? the woman was much more shrewd than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't be blamed for it? he had no knowledge of the market price of the ores. Since Camilla was a martial artist from the Harlen Divine Kingdom, she had been exposed to such materials and could distinguish them since she was at a young age. These ores were produced in Feather Holy Sea, and Luo Luo Zheng failed to look up any information on them in the memories of the great world's will.</p>

  <p>"Since you saved me before, I'll help you exchange the life stones right here!"</p>

  <p>With a smile, Camilla added, "But you'll have to pay me commissions for every deal I make."</p>
