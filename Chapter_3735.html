<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Dorothy stepped into the door, the smell of sweet rust filled her nose, even before her eyes adjusted to the darkness.</p>

  <p>Frowning, she felt a sense of confusion.</p>

  <p>"How come I can smell at all?" she pondered aloud.</p>

  <p>She was just a Soul of Light which didn't have a sense of smell...</p>

  <p>But to her surprise, when she looked herself up and down, she seemed no longer an ordinary Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Her soul body was filled with red threads which glowed like a lustrous ruby.</p>

  <p>These red threads formed veins on her neck, arms, and legs, and even formed outlines of her internal organs, eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.</p>

  <p>"What... happened to me?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy took a few steps back in fear, instinctively bolting back to the door.</p>

  <p>However, at the thought of her grandmother, the fear in her heart dissolved like snow in the summer.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of fate was waiting for her, she was willing to accept it.</p>

  <p>If Dorothy had been to the Soul City, she would have found that everything that was happening to her Soul of Light was very similar to stepping into the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that she didn't need to enter the soul cloud; she only had to step through the door.</p>

  <p>Since her soul now had gained the five senses, she became more sensitive to the illusions around her. She could even see the dark passageway before her quite clearly.</p>

  <p>"Are these...prisons?" She frowned.</p>

  <p>On both sides of the passageway, countless rooms separated by menacing fences lined the path.</p>

  <p>The fences closest to the door were all broken. It seemed that someone or something had escaped the prison.</p>

  <p>Dorothy continued to move forward cautiously along the passageway, her gaze constantly sweeping across the rooms on both sides. She needed to be vigilant now.</p>

  <p>"All of them are empty...</p>

  <p>Have all the things locked in them run away?</p>

  <p>But I have seen those monsters before."</p>

  <p>In her eyes, those monsters represented fear.</p>

  <p>When she was young, she often woke up screaming from nightmares of these monsters...</p>

  <p>Yet, at the same time, these monsters also represented strength.</p>

  <p>She needed strength. She knew she was only going to get it through these monsters. Clenching her fist, she knew she wanted to face them.</p>

  <p>As she kept walking, she passed by more and more empty cages. She couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed. After all, she had summoned up the courage to open the door, only to be greeted by empty prisons. This was not what she had expected.</p>

  <p>Just as she passed by another empty room, she suddenly heard a rustling sound coming from up ahead.</p>

  <p>She quickened her pace, her heart beating rapidly.</p>

  <p>As soon as she approached the iron fence, a big hand covered in thick fur suddenly grabbed at the metal bars. "Bang!"</p>

  <p>All the fences shook violently.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>"Awoo..."</p>

  <p>When the other monsters heard this, they too rushed towards the fences.</p>

  <p>They pounded on the metal bars aggressively, howling and shrieking in frustration.</p>

  <p>The entire passageway became noisy at this moment. Squinting through the darkness, Dorothy thought she saw something in the distance. To her horror, she realized it was a humongous monster's mouth, gaping widely. Its surging aura forced Dorothy to take a few steps backward.</p>

  <p>The monsters in the prisons began to scream excitedly, as though they were alerting something.</p>

  <p>From the depths of the darkness, two rays of red light suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>The red lights suddenly grew nearer and nearer, quickly closing the distance between them and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>As the monster approached, Dorothy could finally see its face clearly.</p>

  <p>It looked like a huge monkey. Its limbs were long and dangling, covered in thick fur that hung low above the ground. Its fingers had dangerously sharp nails that scratched the earth as it ran towards her.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyes widened. It was the same monster that had observed her from the door countless times before!</p>

  <p>"You... I'm here now," Dorothy said cautiously.</p>

  <p>She wanted to find out who it was.</p>

  <p>Somehow, she felt as though she knew it from before.</p>

  <p>It had observed her many times, and she had also observed it many times.</p>

  <p>Somehow, it didn't seem appropriate for her to ask this question.</p>

  <p>The monster stretched out its long arms, and its sharp nails were extended towards Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Even in the dark, the monster's nails glinted menacingly. Dorothy had no doubt that this monster could easily rip her into shreds.</p>

  <p>However, it stopped abruptly and knelt down on one knee before her.</p>

  <p>"We... We've been waiting for so many years," it stammered, as though exhausted. "It's so painful. Please fulfill your promise and help us!"</p>

  <p>Its voice was hoarse, like two pieces of rusty iron rubbing against each other.</p>

  <p>But Dorothy saw past its strange voice. She could tell that this monster was...begging her.</p>

  <p>"Help you?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyes were filled with confusion.</p>

  <p>"The curses on our bodies have lasted for too long. Many of my companions couldn't hold on any longer and all ended their lives. I dragged them out of the prisons and buried them..." the monster responded woefully.</p>

  <p>Now, Dorothy had new pieces to her puzzle.</p>

  <p>The monsters in the rooms had been locked away here, cursed to wait for her arrival.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed she had gotten there a little too late.</p>

  <p>The big holes on the fences must've been created by this monkey-like monster in front of her. The monsters hadn't escaped, instead they had been buried...</p>

  <p>"I don't know how to remove your curses," Dorothy said slowly.</p>

  <p>Her mind was whirling. Her grandmother, Ying, was well aware that she had this door, and that she could order around the monsters within it.</p>

  <p>However, her grandmother had never mentioned what this door meant, or what her relationship was with these monsters.</p>

  <p>Maybe, even Ying didn't know...</p>

  <p>As soon as Dorothy finished speaking, the monsters on both sides of the passageway immediately roared in despair.</p>

  <p>Her answer did not satisfy them.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The monster swiped at her, enveloping her tiny soul in its massive fist.</p>

  <p>"Impossible! How could you not know?" The monster's voice was filled with indignation. "This is not what we agreed on. You should have saved us!"</p>

  <p>The monster was extremely powerful. With a simple flick of its wrist, it could squeeze Dorothy to death.</p>

  <p>She felt as though she were a fragile porcelain doll in its hand.</p>

  <p>"Awoo... Awoo..."</p>

  <p>The voice of the monsters on both sides of the passageway gradually sounded the same.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear them?" The monster's grating voice continued. "They said if you couldn't do it, they would kill you... They have been in despair for too long. They don't care about killing off their last bit of hope!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy trembled. She knew that this was not only a threat, but a bared truth.</p>

  <p>She had grown up blissfully, with a rather uneventful childhood. Never in her wildest dreams would she have imagined that this whole time, these monsters had been hoping for her to come.</p>

  <p>Even as she stepped through that door, she had known nothing about it.</p>

  <p>She sympathized with them. Desperately, she too wished she knew how to lift the curse.</p>

  <p>"Hoo... Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was clamoring, they suddenly heard a sharp voice from the depths of the darkness.</p>

  <p>The master of the voice seemed to be very authoritative. The instant it spoke, the passageway instantly grew silent.</p>

  <p>Biting her lips, Dorothy muttered apologetically, "I really don't know..."</p>

  <p>"Purr... Hoo..." the voice in the distance continued grunting.</p>

  <p>The monster that held Dorothy in its hand listened for a while before dropping her onto the ground. Its tone slightly softened. "Follow me..."</p>
