  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soft footsteps echoed as Luo Luo Zheng entered the palace. A white-faced refiner immediately appeared in front of him and insolently eyed him from head to toe, his arms crossed against his chest.</p>

  <p>"Wow, the third rank of the Illuminating Soul Realm! I'm curious as to how you have signed up for this," the white-faced man said. He grinned toothily at Luo Luo Zheng, but Luo Luo Zheng just glanced at him.</p>

  <p>Based on his life vitality's fluctuation level, Luo Luo Zheng gauged that he had just entered the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my way," Luo Luo Zheng said coldly.</p>

  <p>He was here to take the pre-qualifying match and not to stir up trouble.</p>

  <p>Plus, this was the World Commercial Alliance's place, so the Alliance wouldn't just stand by and do nothing if a fight ensued.</p>

  <p>"Tsk tsk," the white-faced refiner shook his head. "So much pride, so little talent. Tell me, how did you pass the test of the magnetic stone?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned a little, and his eyes looked defeated. It seemed that wherever he went, he always came across some people who wanted to make things hard for him. He thought for a second, then he smirked, "You really want to know?"</p>

  <p>"I said I'm curious, didn't I? Have you got no ears?" the refiner said. He cocked one eyebrow as he waited impatiently for Luo Zheng's answer.</p>

  <p>"Curious or not, it's none of your business. How I passed the test of the magnetic stone is no concern of yours," Luo Luo Zheng calmly answered him and stressed each syllable of his words.</p>

  <p>Laughter erupted from the refiners around them. It was amusing to see a refiner at the Internal Elixir Realm get mocked by a refiner at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Of course, the white-faced refiner didn't think that it was amusing at all.</p>

  <p>Being laughed at brought a rather odd-looking flush to his sickly pale face.</p>

  <p>"You?" he said with gritted teeth. He positioned himself into an offensive stance, ready to pounce on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng just stared at him without even a hint of unease. He was motionless as a crocodile that lurked in a deep pond.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, Luo Luo Zheng had not only learned the nine Original Laws, his soul had also entered the Fighting Soul Realm. On top of that, he had ingested a drop of Genuine Dragon blood essence, and ten drops of Genuine Dragon blood in the Dragon Lineage Human's refining sanctum in the last two months. After that, his refining level skyrocketed and his body became much stronger.</p>

  <p>Now, he was already at the third level of Malicious Wheel of Life and Death, a tier 5 cultivation method.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had reached the first level of skill, he had easily defeated Frank.</p>

  <p>He was still a nature creature at that time. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had stepped into the third rank of Illuminating Soul Realm, his strength improved greatly and manifested itself at the Dragon Soar Arena. Moreover, he had also fought with Mason from the Bloodwood Cliff. With his knowledge of the Space Law, he had seriously injured Mason with just one blow.</p>

  <p>It would be a good chance for Luo Luo Zheng to get a general idea of his capabilities if the white-faced refiner tried to pick a fight.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng's face remained impassive, but every part of his body tensed up quickly and quietly. He was ready for any incoming attack from the white-faced refiner in no time.</p>

  <p>Just as the white-faced refiner was about to launch an attack, a steward of the World Commercial Alliance walked towards them.</p>

  <p>His face was dim as he warned, "Whoever fights here will be banned from the pre-qualifying match and expelled from Oracle City!"</p>

  <p>The white-faced refiner's expression changed instantly at the steward's words. He already had the chance to enter the pre-qualifying match, and he clearly didn't want to lose it and get expelled. All he could do now was to hold back his anger.</p>

  <p>"Just wait and see!" he said through gritted teeth and pointed a finger at Luo Zheng's face. "I will make you suffer in the pre-qualifying match!"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," Luo Luo Zheng answered icily.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the pre-qualifying match or the main draw match, Luo Luo Zheng would face them in his best condition. That was why he didn't restrain himself at all. He adjusted his fighting spirit to its best.</p>

  <p>All the other refiners were surprised when Luo Luo Zheng didn't flinch at all and answered quite confidently. This refiner was only at the third rank of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Did he really think he could win the fight against a refiner who had just entered the Internal Elixir Realm? Or, did he have some trump cards up his sleeve?</p>

  <p>The Central Region was a huge and densely populated place, with billions of refiners that lived in it. 'There are all kinds of fish in the sea, ' as the old saying went. It was no surprise if refiners with special talents turned up, considering the number of refiners who lived in the region.</p>

  <p>However, only a few people thought so. Most of the refiners still didn't think much of Luo Luo Zheng. In their eyes, Luo Luo Zheng was just a green boy at the Illuminating Soul Realm, and his arrogance would just lead him to an early grave. It was impossible for him to pass the pre-qualifying match, and face the white-faced refiner after. He was simply putting a rope around his own neck.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a middle-aged refiner in a brown overcoat went in front of the palace. Everyone knew that the pre-qualifying match was about to start, so Luo Luo Zheng was no longer the center of attention.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for coming all this way to attend the Martial Arts Contest. It is a great honor for us, the World Commercial Alliance, to hold the contest and have everyone here," The middle-aged refiner said in a booming voice.</p>

  <p>As expected from a commercial organization, the World Commercial Alliance was good at rhetoric throughout the Martial Arts Contest. It was why it had won over many outstanding refiners, among which were independent refiners who were even just as good as some leaders of the fourth-grade sects.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations on your successful registration! Now it's time for the pre-qualifying match. After this, three people will be selected to enter the main draw match," the middle-aged refiner announced.</p>

  <p>"Only three places for the main draw match? This is going to be very tricky..."</p>

  <p>"Three out of several hundred people. A long shot for everyone."</p>

  <p>"Ha, I will be one of the three people!"</p>

  <p>When everyone heard that only three people would get into the main draw match, they began to chatter all at once. Their discussion gave away their mindsets and warrior spirits. It also separated the lions from the sheep.</p>

  <p>Some refiners were worried about how they hardly stood out, and some were confident about winning. Others silently calculated their chances.</p>

  <p>All their expressions varied from being expectant, cautious, prudent, and anxious.</p>

  <p>If anyone noticed Luo Zheng's face at that moment, they would find that his eyes were ignited by the persistent belief of winning.</p>

  <p>The pre-qualifying match was held every day before the main draw match started. It meant that each day, three people were selected for the main draw match.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng couldn't get to first place in the pre-qualifying match, he might as well quit the main draw match. After all, his goal was to kill Marilyn Si.</p>

  <p>Marilyn was already in the middle of the Internal Elixir Realm. She also had the Purple Power Body like Yan, and had been cultivated by Eddie. It wasn't hard to figure out how dangerous this enemy would be.</p>

  <p>So, this was just the first step.</p>

  <p>"And here are the rules of the pre-qualifying match?" The middle-aged refiner began to talk about the rules of the pre-qualifying match in a clear, loud voice. The four hundred refiners in the area also quieted down and listened carefully to the rules.</p>

  <p>There was a 'match' in the pre-qualifying match--but instead of simply being a match, it was also a test. To be more precise, it was an enormous magic array the World Commercial Alliance set up.</p>

  <p>This magic array could top all the other arrays that Luo Luo Zheng had ever seen. The one he had seen in the Cloud Sect was like a kid's toy compared to this magic array.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged refiner spent half of his time elaborating on the rules, then took a step aside. Then, he uncovered the curtain that hung over the palace wall with a single wave.</p>

  <p>"Now that you all know the rules, it's time to get into the magic array!"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged refiner added with a smile, "Good luck to you all!"</p>

  <p>Behind the curtain was a big black shadow, which was the entrance of this huge magic array. The participants of the pre-qualifying match formed a line in front of the entrance and disappeared into it one by one.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the last to arrive, so he was the last in line. The middle-aged refiner had seen Luo Luo Zheng before he entered and was surprised at his refining level. However, he smiled at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "Good luck to you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Luo Luo Zheng said calmly, then entered the magic array.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged refiner rubbed the bridge of his nose. It was incredible.</p>

  <p>The pre-qualifying match was held for several days. Even refiners at the peak of the Illuminating Soul Realm were rare in the pre-qualifying match, but here was a refiner at the third rank of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>However, the middle-aged refiner sensed Luo Zheng's confidence! Did he really think that he could get into the main draw match?</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng entered the magic array, he found himself in the middle of a vast white space. Little by little, the outline of the surrounding scenery revealed itself.</p>

  <p>On the lush grassland was a pagoda, which was as tall as three people. Two words which read "Luo Luo Zheng Luo" were inscribed on it. An archer with a long bow stood on the pagoda.</p>

  <p>"What an interesting magic array!" Luo Luo Zheng said as a smile crossed his face.</p>
