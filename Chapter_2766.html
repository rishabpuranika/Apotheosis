<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The light emitted by the Scorching Gold was extremely intense, but it couldn't spread far in the black water.</p>

  <p id="top_28">However, the force of primitive fear in the undercurrents had been dispelled by the golden light from the Scorching Gold, so Zheng didn't feel uncomfortable at all.</p>

  <p>Plop, plop, plop...</p>

  <p>As they continued to swim downward in the black water, the turbulent undercurrents became stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>Some of these undercurrents surged toward Zheng, intending to sweep him away from Sword Chen's side.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up. These creatures are watching us greedily. If the undercurrents manage to sweep you away, you will lose your life," Sword Chen warned.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and followed closely after the Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>From afar, it looked as if the two were moving forward in a dark forest under the light of the triangular bullion. If that light was extinguished, they would immediately be devoured by the menacing beasts.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's bubble was floating undisturbed in the middle of the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>The depth of the Sea of Meditation was far beyond Zheng's expectation.</p>

  <p>Although they weren't swimming slowly by any means, it took Zheng an hour to finally feel the seabed under his feet.</p>

  <p>Just as he did every time he ventured a new place, he released his spiritual sense and found a huge trench in front of him. He didn't know how far it extended.</p>

  <p>"Here we are. You can stick the first sword there,"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen said, pointing to one side of the trench.</p>

  <p>Zheng let his spiritual sense wander over to the place that Sword Chen was pointing at and soon found that a sharp sword was stabbed into the surface of the trench.</p>

  <p>"Okay," he said before obediently taking out a long sword.</p>

  <p>Following Sword Chen's example, he activated the mark at the bottom of the sword and then launched the sword fiercely toward the surface of the trench.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The black water was very viscous, and the water pressure at the bottom of the sea was extremely high.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, with his strength, Zheng was able to launch the sword with enough force. The long sword left a string of bubbles in its wake as it flew toward the trench.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>A moment later, a dull sound was heard.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Sword Chen both swept the area with their spiritual senses and found that half of the long sword was stabbed firmly into the trench. Sword Chen turned to Zheng and gave him a thumbs up.</p>

  <p>The long sword had already been refined by Sword Chen, so when Zheng activated it and inserted it into the trench, it formed a subtle connection with Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled as he threw his spiritual sense upward.</p>

  <p>Before this, he hadn't released his spiritual sense into the rest of the sea because he had been afraid of the unknown creatures. But since Sword Chen did not stop him now, it meant that there was no longer any danger in releasing his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng thoroughly swept the area above him but couldn't find anything there.</p>

  <p>There was nothing but black water.</p>

  <p>This was completely different from what he intuitively sensed.</p>

  <p>He could clearly feel that many unknown creatures were following him and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>He could even tell that these unknown creatures were of different sizes and were floating back and forth overhead. Some of the bigger creatures were still tirelessly propelling the undercurrents at him, trying to roll him out of the area covered by the golden light of the Scorching Gold.</p>

  <p>So why couldn't Zheng detect them with his spiritual sense? It made no sense.</p>

  <p>"As I told you before, we can't detect the existence of these unknown creatures because they are unknown fears. You can feel them, but you can't verify their existence," Sword Chen explained, easily guessing what Zheng was wondering about.</p>

  <p>"There is no way to verify their existence..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with curiosity. He didn't know why the Sea of Meditation existed. Did it have special functions like the Reincarnation Land? Or was it just an extremely dangerous area that had formed without purpose?</p>

  <p>After the first long sword was inserted, the triangular Scorching Gold, which was originally the size of a fist, had burned down to just over the size of a thumb.</p>

  <p>As the area covered by the golden light shrank from ten feet to just a few feet, Zheng clearly sensed the unknown creatures hiding in the black water were moving closer to them.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen just indifferently took out another piece of Scorching Gold from his space ring and rubbed it gently.</p>

  <p>As it began to glow, he threw another piece of Scorching Gold to Zheng and said, "Take this and use it in case of need."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head. After putting away the Scorching Gold, he walked along the trench to the left.</p>

  <p>But he had barely taken two steps when he felt a powerful spiral current from the black water ahead.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The stream of current spiraled toward him at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng came to his senses, the spiral current had wrapped his body, spinning him and sending him backward.</p>

  <p>"Oh no!"</p>

  <p>A tense expression appeared on Sword Chen's face.</p>

  <p>If the spiral current managed to push Zheng out of the area covered by the light of the Scorching Gold, he would die without a doubt.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen immediately wiggled forward, getting himself trapped in the spiral current as well.</p>

  <p>In this way, he was moving back in the water at the same speed as Zheng, and Zheng was always under the light of the Scorching Gold.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>After pushing Zheng and Sword Chen back for more than ten miles, the power of the spiral current began to weaken and the two wrestled free from it.</p>

  <p>"That current is so powerful. What is it?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>He felt like almost all of his strength had been drained by that current. The viscosity of the black water made it difficult to release any sort of power, so Zheng had only managed to exert a tiny portion of his power.</p>

  <p>Even though he had tried his best to fight against the spiral current, he hadn't been able to escape from it.</p>

  <p>"That current is also an unknown thing," Sword Chen said, looking off into the darkness with a solemn expression on his face. "But it is a very powerful one. The fiends call it the Devil. We are in trouble..."</p>

  <p>"The Devil?"</p>

  <p>Zheng pondered over the name for a moment and then said, "Since it is also an unknown thing, it should also be afraid of the Scorching Gold, right?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Sword Chen. "But it's so powerful that once it targets its prey, it will be difficult for the latter to escape from it even with the protection of the Scorching Gold!"</p>

  <p>After finishing his sentence, he suddenly pulled Zheng by his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Thanks to him, Zheng had just barely dodged an extremely thin spiral current.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the current, which was not much thicker than the tip of a needle, might have pierced through Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"See why I said it's powerful?" A bitter smile appeared on Sword Chen's face.</p>
