  <p>
</p>

  <p>To the west of the Supreme Pure Realm, the sky glowed an ominous red for several days.</p>

  <p>A huge fire cloud floated in the sky day and night, and could be seen clearly from thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>Below this fire cloud was the Amber Cave. People trembled in fear at its name. Amber Cave was the base of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>The Amber Cave was notorious in the Supreme Pure Realm. No one was willing to set foot near it.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization never wanted to near it, either.</p>

  <p>The members of the Element Spirit race were composed of energy. If they came into contact with the white mist of the Amber Cave, their energy would be sucked into it till they were exhausted. Once all their energy was drained, they would die.</p>

  <p>For the members of the Element Spirit race, this was a tragic way to die.</p>

  <p>Legend said there was once a member of the Element Spirit race chasing after a member of the Nihility race. When the former neared the Amber Cave, the white mist gathered to form a huge hand that grabbed the warrior, and the warrior was never to be found since.</p>

  <p>Since then, the members of the Element Spirit race never dared approach the Amber Cave again.</p>

  <p>But today, the Element Spirit Civilization launched a massive attack on the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>On the ground on one side of the Amber Cave, there was a huge rune. The Holy Wings Armor sat upright in the center of the rune.</p>

  <p>Flames were constantly erupting from the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>The flames followed the lines of the rune and gathered at the end, forming a huge swirl of flame, which spiraled towards the sky.</p>

  <p>This was how the huge fire cloud was formed.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>The fire cloud in the sky shook violently.</p>

  <p>Drops of fire rained down from the fire cloud, falling into the white mist.</p>

  <p>The white mist could devour all kinds of energy....</p>

  <p>The fire rain had incredible destructive power, but it seemed as though the white mist just swallowed it up with no qualms.</p>

  <p>Standing nearby, the Eye Spirit stared at the spectacular scene, blinking occasionally.</p>

  <p>Sitting cross-legged beside him, Claire looked bored.</p>

  <p>After a while, she yawned. "After so long, the mist in the Amber Cave hasn't weakened, even a bit..."</p>

  <p>"The Void Dust's appetite is shocking. It's not easy to satisfy it," replied the Eye Spirit calmly.</p>

  <p>It was speculated that a fire cloud that huge should have gathered all the power of all the fire spirits in the entire Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>After several consecutive days of burning, there didn't seem to be any changes to the white mist.</p>

  <p>Like what the Eye Spirit mentioned, the white mist was actually Void Dust that spread all over the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>In the Jade Pure Realm, it was colorless and tasteless. If anyone had the misfortune of drifting away from a Pure Sky Platform, they would be quietly devoured by the Void Dust, never to see the light of day again.</p>

  <p>When the Void Dust was moved to the Amber Cave, it gained a white color and seemed to have form, although it seemed just like a vapor.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Eye Spirit finished speaking, the white mist suddenly surged. dozens of misty dragons popped out of the white mist and headed straight for the fire cloud in the sky.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>"They finally got impatient?" A hint of excitement flashed in Claire's eyes.</p>

  <p>These mist dragons soared into the sky and went straight for the fire cloud, trying to wipe it out.</p>

  <p>"It's not that they got impatient," said the Eye Spirit calmly.</p>

  <p>"Don't they just want to put out the fire cloud?" asked Claire.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit smiled faintly and chuckled. "The source of the fire cloud is here, but they head for the fire cloud. Why is that?"</p>

  <p>"They plan to take us by surprise?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Just then, the mist formed a huge hand that extended towards them from the Amber Cave. In one sweeping motion, the giant hand slapped the area where the Eye Spirit and his companions were.</p>

  <p>The power contained in this slap was enough to squash them into nothingness, leaving only a deep palm print on the ground.</p>

  <p>Something similar had happened before, leaving a giant print in the shape of a hand on the ground. Over time, it filled with water, forming a lake, which was then named the Five Fingers Lake by the creatures in the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit had expected the counterattack from the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>He blinked, and suddenly the space was dislocated.</p>

  <p>From the position where he and Clare stood to the place of the rune that was burning with flames, the space had moved backward five thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss...</p>

  <p>There was no shocking impact or sound when the huge foggy hand slapped down.</p>

  <p>It sank into the ground silently and devoured everything along the way without a sound.</p>

  <p>After leaving a huge palm print on the ground, the white mist quickly flowed back into the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>When the white mist retreated, the Eye Spirit blinked again, and the space returned to where it had originally been.</p>

  <p>Because the foundation below had been devoured by the Void Dust, the Eye Spirit, Claire, and the Holy Wings Armor looked as if they were standing on a cubic stone.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle...</p>

  <p>By now, the mist dragons had devoured half of the fire cloud. However, with a flash of light on the surface of the Holy Wings Armor, flame began to flow onto the huge rune once again. The swirl of flames also quickly blew up, sending more and more flames into the fire cloud.</p>

  <p>The only purpose of the Element Spirit Civilization was to drain their enemy.</p>

  <p>The Void Dust could indeed devour everything, but it was impossible to devour things infinitely.</p>

  <p>Even if the Void Dust had a shocking appetite, there would come a time when it would be satisfied.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Eye Spirit had been waiting for the counterattack of the Nihility race this whole time.</p>

  <p>If the members of the Nihility race hadn't made any movement, and they were not afraid of the rain of fire that constantly came down, they didn't need to do anything at all. All they needed to do was to stay within the Amber Cave.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the Element Spirit Civilization wouldn't be able to break in.</p>

  <p>However, the Nihility race fought back, and in turn, it proved that the Eye Spirit's guess was right: the Void Dust's appetite was slowly being satiated!</p>

  <p>If the fire rain continued to burn, sooner or later, the Void Dust would become full.</p>

  <p>"Let the thunder spirits join the fight!" the Eye Spirit ordered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Gavyn from within the armor.</p>

  <p>Soon after, streaks of lightning began to circulate the rune. Ominous crackling noises could be heard constantly from the edge of the fire cloud above, and then the fire cloud was enveloped in flashes of lightning.</p>

  <p>Just as the Element Spirit Civilization launched a more aggressive attack, a ball of flame suddenly shot out in the distance.</p>

  <p>It was getting closer and closer.</p>

  <p>Claire squinted at it and said, "It's the avatar of Sanderson."</p>

  <p>After the three stone statues in the underground cave were destroyed, the Eye Spirit had sent three fire spirits there.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>Sanderson's avatar came to the Eye Spirit's side and reported to him, "The passageway to the Night View Island has been repaired."</p>

  <p>All the eyes of the Eye Spirit sparkled with excitement.</p>

  <p>Claire raised her eyebrows and smiled devilishly. "Your hunch is right," she said to the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit did not respond. He was awakening an eye on his body.</p>

  <p>A white film was attached to the surface of the eyeball. After the eye woke up, the white film began to quickly peel off, turning into a small white snake.</p>

  <p>The little white snake glanced at the Amber Cave and scolded the Eye Spirit, "Are you stupid or something? After all this time, you still haven't taken down the Amber Cave! Our plan regarding the Ten Directions House has been delayed for several days!"</p>

  <p>Claire's expression darkened and she trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of all the members of the Element Spirit race, the Eye Spirit was a supreme existence. Being scolded by this small white snake made Claire, who was loyal to the Eye Spirit, feel very uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>But she also knew that everything in the Element Spirit Civilization was bestowed by them.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the Holy Wings Armor, the Treacherous Beings they had merged with, or even the rise of the Element Spirit Civilization were all due to them.</p>

  <p>When the Eye Spirit told her that these snakes hiding in the depths of the Jade Pure Realm were the foundation of the Element Spirit Civilization, she was too shocked to even speak.</p>
