  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Fuxi's words, the leaders of the large races let out gasps and sighs.</p>

  <p>They were taken aback by the horrific news.</p>

  <p>These people, despite being the backbone of their races, were not spokespersons.</p>

  <p>And although they were aware of the situation in the Source World, they had no idea it would come so soon.</p>

  <p>Didn't they still have at least ten years left?</p>

  <p>To their utmost disgrace, the Shade Stones fell faster and faster from the hourglass. Phoenix and the others had already looked into it, and they thought they still had at least ten years left.</p>

  <p>It had slipped their minds that some things could accelerate without warning.</p>

  <p>Once things hit a critical point, they would erupt.</p>

  <p>That was exactly what had happened on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Still, Phoenix and the rest were puzzled. Before they set out, Emperor Di Jun of the Jin Wu and the Xuanyuan of the Bearing race had not yet returned from the Other Shore. They had no clue what took place in the upper stages.</p>

  <p>However, Fuxi was under no obligation to make their doubts disappear.</p>

  <p>After all, many races still stood tall on the opposite side of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Instead, he just ignored them and vanished before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>In the same moment, one of the leaders pointed at the center of the array.</p>

  <p>"Some people have entered the core area. They come from the Li Shan mountain!"</p>

  <p>At the center of the ring-like mountain range was a wide, open area that was perfect for large gatherings. In addition to the main peak in the middle, there were a hundred circular arrays resting there.</p>

  <p>If a person wanted to refine their Chaotic Source Spirits, they would have to enter a circular array. These were arranged by the powerhouses of the Nine Li race, with the help of other super forces. Luckily, the arrays were safe and could protect anyone who stayed inside them.</p>

  <p>In the past, after obtaining enough Chaotic Source Spirits, creatures would rush towards the arrays.</p>

  <p>This would allow them to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>However, entering an array was not as easy as it seemed. Many strong warriors failed to obtain enough Chaotic Source Spirits, so they had to be creative to gain more. Often, warriors would wait around the arrays and attack incoming warriors. This meant that many battles would happen before anyone successfully arrived at an array.</p>

  <p>Some races even came together to guard the arrays. Although this was discouraged, this tactic did not break any rules.</p>

  <p>Compared to everyone else, the Li Shan mountain was the most prepared. They were able to enter the Chaotic Source World first, but to their disgrace, they reaped little. For some reason, they found nothing after exploring most of the western peak. Because of this, they moved down heading for the main peak itself.</p>

  <p>Yan was walking before everyone else, leading the group. Before she entered the main peak, she looked around the ring-like mountain range, a little disappointed with the results.</p>

  <p>"Yan, why are you hesitating?" a woman asked her. "Shouldn't we go ahead?"</p>

  <p>This woman had her hair pinned up in a bun with more than a dozen golden hairpins. They were interesting because, if you looked closely, these hairpins were her Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Generally, a lot of divine crystals were consumed when the Other Shore Tokens descended, but these golden hairpins were always on her head.</p>

  <p>The woman's name was Natalie. She was one of the best human warriors in the Li Shan mountain, and became Yan's first friend in the Li Shan mountain. At this point, the two were like sisters.</p>

  <p>"All of the nine caves and eighteen veins at the main peak are quite dangerous. Even though we have been well prepared, obtaining Chaotic Source Spirits won't be simple. My brother Luo Zheng..." Yan trailed away, pursing her lips as a wave of anxiety washed over her.</p>

  <p>After entering the Chaotic Source World, Yan tried her best to find Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the hurricanes got in the way of any progress, and the Chaotic Source World was too vast to be explored from end to end. Luo Zheng was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>If Yan had known earlier that this would happen, she would have left a soul mark on Luo Zheng before entering. She was too confident at the time, and now, she was regretful of her decision.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you always say your brother is an invincible warrior," Natalie said.</p>

  <p>"Why are you worried about him now?" She gave Yan a reassuring smile and a friendly pat on the back.</p>

  <p>This was true; Yan often mentioned brilliant things about Luo Zheng to Natalie. In her eyes, Luo Zheng was all powerful, even though Natalie didn't agree with her a hundred percent.</p>

  <p>There were just too many talents in the world for Luo Zheng to be considered the best. In the Snake Goddess race alone, there were countless talents that couldn't be compared to one another. Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was from an unknown, unrecognized place.</p>

  <p>Sure, he might be the strongest from where he came from, but in the Source World, he was close to nothing.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of the Chaotic Source World, Luo Zheng even had a quarrel with Phoenix. Natalie saw this as unnecessary, and frankly, a little cocky. This did not mean his strength was strong, and after all, he had the help and support of Qiu Yinhe and Winchell, well-known masters of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>What confused Natalie was that Fuxi had come forward to protect Luo Zheng, saying that Luo Zheng was his opponent.</p>

  <p>What puzzled her even more was that the Soul Devouring Demon from the Black Ship was born in Luo Zheng's inner world. Oddly enough, though the demon was born within him, he never listened to his orders.</p>

  <p>This led Natalie to wonder more and more about the mysterious Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid something bad would happen to him," Yan expressed, shaking her head in disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Your brother is powerful, Yan! He can protect himself," responded Natalie.</p>

  <p>"And besides, he's not the only one who will enter the main peak. We all have to do so. Don't think too much."</p>

  <p>Although there were nine paths and eighteen diversions in the main peak, there were many competitors aiming for the Chaotic Source Spirits. But because they were the first group at the entrance, they had the upper hand compared to the rest.</p>

  <p>Waiting might as well be a waste of time. They'd miss a great opportunity if they stalled for too long.</p>

  <p>"Sounds reasonable."</p>

  <p>Yan nodded and stepped forward, leading all the creatures from the Li Shan mountain into the main peak.</p>

  <p>Not long after they entered, the sky began to rumble and darken. It was a hurricane again.</p>

  <p>It surged in the Chaotic Source World and seemed to be even stronger at the core.</p>

  <p>After the hurricane stopped, several more teams appeared. They were from the Bearing race, the Jin Wu, and the Divine Farmer race. The one who led them all had silver hair, and carried a long, mighty spear. It was no other than the most outstanding talent of the Bearing race, Khalid.</p>

  <p>The large group made it through the plain without any delay. They found a cave at the foot of the main peak and entered.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's group had failed their exploration at the eastern peak.</p>

  <p>Because of this, they moved down from the top of the eastern peak along with the Ear Mice. All together, they passed through the plain and headed for the main peak.</p>

  <p>When they passed through the circular arrays along the plain, Luo Zheng paused and turned towards the Ear Mice. He asked, "Are these large arrays used to refine Chaotic Source Spirits?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! They have the ability to refine Chaotic Source Spirits, and do very well as temporary shields," an Ear Mouse responded.</p>

  <p>Once a cultivator entered an array, they'd be safe from outside forces.</p>

  <p>However, each array had a limited capacity to hold only ten-odd cultivators at a time.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, maybe you should just refine the Chaotic Source Spirits here," Sally suggested, her eyes lighting up at what the Ear Mouse had said.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits they obtained from the cave was enough for one person to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. Sally was more than willing to give her Chaotic Source Spirits to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Sally was thinking that if Luo Zheng could reach the Chaotic Source Realm, his strength would have improved a hundred fold. Afterwards, he wouldn't be afraid of the young man in black anymore.</p>

  <p>"It's a good idea," said Chaim. "But if Luo Zheng reaches the Chaotic Source Realm, he will be sent out of the Chaotic Source World for good." He had a deep intensity in his eyes. "Are you sure you want Luo Zheng to leave?"</p>
