</p>

  <p>As a Thunder Law beginner, one had to release life vitality into the weapon and shoot it at the enemy.</p>

  <p>After reaching a certain degree of control, one could use thunder and lightning to encircle and temper one's body. For a martial artist, this was an easy task.</p>

  <p>But the power of thunder and lightning circulated within one's organs? it wasn't a major problem, but it couldn't be channeled into his brain.</p>

  <p>A warrior's soul was fragile and one could easily be injured from being struck by thunder. All martial artists that cultivated the Thunder Law had the power of thunder isolated right under their necks.</p>

  <p>In the universe, there were many martial artists that could control thunder and lightning. But under normal circumstances, no one would bring these elements into one's own mind. No matter how powerful one's mind was, it was no easy feat withstanding the torment of thunder and lightning.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Xenia had actually completely turned herself into lightning.</p>

  <p>Such was different from the lightning escape skill? with this, one could only hide within thunder and lightning.</p>

  <p>The lightning escape skill could greatly increase a martial artist's flight speed. But this didn't mean that one could use lightning to move forward? lightning speed was nearly immeasurable as it traveled through space, after all.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Thunder World was similar to the Divine Flame World in that there were quite a few Thunder Law Creatures within it.</p>

  <p>But up until now, no warrior had captured a Thunder Law Creature and lived to tell the tale.</p>

  <p>These creatures were all incarnations of thunder and lightning? they came and went with a kind of speed that was impossible to simply catch up to.</p>

  <p>In the history of the universe, there lived an eminent monk from the Blessed Buddha Land who possessed a Thunder Law Creature. It was said that this creature wasn't captured? the eminent monk used a Buddhist doctrine to transform it into his mount.</p>

  <p>"Since this Xenia has completely turned herself into lightning, wouldn't that mean she also possesses instantaneous speed?"</p>

  <p>"If it's really as fast as lightning, it's simply impossible to react to?"</p>

  <p>"I've underestimated this Xenia."</p>

  <p>The instantaneous speed?</p>

  <p>In an instant, 900 lives were lost.</p>

  <p>Such was the limit of speed in the universe.</p>

  <p>Whether it was light or thunder, all were bound by this limit.</p>

  <p>After Xenia completely transformed into lightning, she floated in the air.</p>

  <p>Even as her face was outlined by lightning, she was undeniably attractive.</p>

  <p>"Here I am."</p>

  <p>Just as she spoke her last word, everyone saw a flash of lightning.</p>

  <p>A streak of long and narrow purple lightning bolts turned into a dragon extending across the Heaven Earth Board. It penetrated Tianming's body and arrived at the other end of the board.</p>

  <p>This speed already exceeded the limit of what anyone's eyes could see.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Sound traveled countless times slower than lightning. At this moment, everyone heard a crisp sound of thunder approaching.</p>

  <p>As it resounded, Tianming's hair bun was scattered in an instant as a wound seemed to appear along the side of his neck. The wound was scorched all around with blood flowing from it.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible to dodge an instantaneous attack."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Tianming has no time to react at all."</p>

  <p>"Honestly speaking, I can withstand the power of lightning. But Xenia isn't using ordinary lightning attacks. In this state? she's practically invincible, right?"</p>

  <p>Some of the ace talents and Godly Geniuses watched the battle closely.</p>

  <p>Everyone was trying to figure out how to counter Xenia's attack.</p>

  <p>But as the old saying went, "In this world, so long as one is fast enough, they have the potential to be unbeatable."</p>

  <p>The attack was already instantaneous, so what could be done to stop it?</p>

  <p>As Lucille stared indifferently at Xenia, a small ring appeared in her hand. It was made from life vitality, containing the power of the five elements.</p>

  <p>"After Xenia transformed into lightning? It's true that she turned ridiculously fast. But I can use the power of the five elements to restrain her. But it won't be easy?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Lucille was the most powerful of the ace talents? unlike the others, she had trained in the Five Elements Divine Dao from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't have the internal momentum, she had also comprehended almost all the Five Elements Divine Dao. Like Luo Luo Zheng, she was merely a step away from the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"I did not use my full strength just now." After turning into lightning, Xenia's voice seemed to come from a distant space. "Next time," she continued, "if you still refuse to draw your sword, you really won't stand a chance. You won't be able to catch up with me. Even pulling out your sword right now won't change anything."</p>

  <p>The faint smile on Tianming's face disappeared, replaced by an incomparably serious expression.</p>

  <p>"The instantaneous speed? It's truly fast. This is the Purple Lightning Body in the Thunderstorm Divine Dao," Tianming stated seriously.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, a hint of doubt flashed across Xenia's face. "You? know this skill?"</p>

  <p>Since the ancient times, very few people had ever stepped into the Divine Dao. The three thousand great ways were all very different.</p>

  <p>Because only Xenia knew the profound mysteries of the Thunderstorm Divine Dao, she had to rely on herself to understand and practice them.</p>

  <p>Even the elders of the Celestial Position race couldn't give her any advice.</p>

  <p>The Purple Lightning Body was something that Xenia had comprehended on her own. There wasn't anyone else aware of it.</p>

  <p>So how could Tianming call out the name of this skill?</p>

  <p>Without replying to her, he continued, "However, you've just become a Godly Genius. The Purple Lightning Body was unable to break through the limit of the universe. It might not be impossible to catch up."</p>

  <p>Once the words left his mouth, the crowd was in an uproar, thinking that Tianming had gone mad.</p>

  <p>Others might not have been able to recognize the Purple Lightning Body, but after Xenia transformed into lightning, her speed was undeniable.</p>

  <p>Her flesh and blood turned into pure lightning? she had reached an instantaneous level of speed. And there was one who actually said he could catch up.</p>

  <p>Unless Tianming could turn into lightning as well, it seemed impossible.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's eyes were brimming with curiosity. He wondered what Tianming would do to counter Xenia's attack.</p>

  <p>"But you do possess the power to make me pull out my sword," Tianming said as he placed his left hand on the sword sheath and pulled it to his waist. His right hand gripped the sword hilt as he slightly bent his body.</p>

  <p>Though the weapon wasn't drawn, seeing Tianming's actions, Xenia put on a blossoming smile. "Very good? Then, it's over for you now!"</p>

  <p>If Tianming didn't make a move to draw his sword, Xenia would have been left disappointed, even if she managed to defeat him.</p>

  <p>Now that she saw how Tianming was willing to fight her with his full strength, she was satisfied? she wanted to make him admit defeat wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>A streak of lightning suddenly flashed on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>But she didn't rush at Tianming immediately. Instead, she kept flashing along the board. Each of her flashes left behind a purple streak in the crowd's eyes. Soon after, thunder rumbled.</p>

  <p>Xenia charged left and right, still not directly at Tianming.</p>

  <p>"She can finish him off in a single move. Why is she stalling?"</p>

  <p>"Why do I feel like she's afraid to strike?"</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? The posture he's taking is the most basic sword drawing skill. It's fast but?how fast could it really be?"</p>

  <p>The crowd was filled with doubt.</p>

  <p>In truth, even Xenia, who had turned into lightning and was flying back and forth at high speed, was put in despair.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling overcame her.</p>

  <p>With her current speed, Tianming couldn't even see her clearly.</p>

  <p>But from the very beginning, she had a strange feeling that Tianming was watching her closely. No matter how fast she was, this guy's gaze would always catch up to her.</p>

  <p>Feeling a hint of danger, she didn't rush up to end the battle immediately.</p>

  <p>But as she flew above the board, she could feel his gaze boring through her somehow, even from behind him.</p>

  <p>This gaze caused Xenia to feel somewhat uneasy and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As she continued to fly, Xenia also felt a trace of frustration.</p>

  <p>The Purple Lightning Body also consumed a great deal of life vitality? she still needed life vitality to support her every movement. The sea of life vitality in her body was like a receding tide, rapidly decreasing.</p>

  <p>A decision had to be made quickly.</p>

  <p>With this thought, she suddenly made three moves on the Heaven Earth Board. Three purple streaks of lightning then formed a triangle, trapping Tianming within.</p>

  <p>But she didn't rush to him from the front. Instead, she flew behind him, traveling through the air before pouncing onto the back of his head.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Tianming could have easily been killed in an instant.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, he drew the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>A faint radiance was emitted from under his feet. As he stepped out of that radiance, a snow-white sword light flashed out from his hand.</p>

  <p>"Flashing...</p>

  <p>Step!"</p>
