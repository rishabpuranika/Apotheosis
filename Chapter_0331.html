  <p>
</p>

  <p>After putting the treasured sword into the weapon refining furnace, Zheng closed the furnace's door casually. Then he went to the seat, where Harrison refined the weapon a few moments earlier. It faced the weapon refining furnace's burner.</p>

  <p>After Zheng took his seat, the demonic life vitality appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The demonic life vitality wrapped up around his hand within seconds.</p>

  <p>The heavenly essence was a big deal. He let Wurth help him sell it at auction because he trusted Wurth and also honestly other than Wurth, he didn't have any better person to help him sell the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>However, he also didn't want anybody but Wurth and himself to know that he had the heavenly essence. So owing to these conditions, Wurth seemed like the only option!</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no way Zheng would let the disciples in the Seventeenth Court before his eyes discover anything.</p>

  <p>In order to meet the purpose, Zheng had to do something about it. The demonic life vitality's colour was a deep brooding dark purple. He made the demonic life vitality wrap up around his hand with the space ring and then took out the heavenly essence from the ring.</p>

  <p>The heavenly essence was mixed in the demonic life vitality and couldn't be spotted from outside.</p>

  <p>After preparing everything in order, Zheng pushed the demonic life vitality to shoot at the weapon refining furnace's burner, and the heavenly essence was wrapped in the demonic life vitality. He couldn't make it all perfect, so the real masters would find out.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng believed that the disciples in the Seventeenth Court couldn't perceive it.</p>

  <p>The demonic life vitality formed a thick line and poured the heavenly essence in the weapon refining furnace one drop after another slowly and delicately.</p>

  <p>Looking at the dark purple demonic life vitality, Harrison's eyelid flickered. He thought no wonder Zheng's life vitality was heavy right now.</p>

  <p>The dark purple life vitality was actually unusual. Zheng was only at grade 1 of the nature level, but his strength couldn't be belittled and was immense.</p>

  <p>Even though the dark purple demonic life vitality was special... It was useless to refine the weapon.</p>

  <p>Harrison saw very clearly that there was no Heavenly Law in the life vitality. In fact Zheng didn't even understand the Heavenly Law. How could he use it to refine with such confidence then?</p>

  <p>Several disciples in the Seventeenth Court all sighed in a synchronised manner expressing disappointment.</p>

  <p>'Alas, it appears that Zheng is just having fun, killing away time and wasting a brilliant sword...'</p>

  <p>But Zheng was not in the mood to care about what they thought instead just concentrated on the task in hand, that is refining.</p>

  <p>It was true Zheng hadn't mastered the Heavenly Law, so in fact, he was not refining but just watering the sword with the heavenly essence. It all came down to what level of the treasured sword could be at last.</p>

  <p>On the contrary to what every one thought, he didn't have the confidence. After all, it was the first time for him to water the weapon with the heavenly essence. There was an extreme possibility that he might make a mysterious weapon or a waste product in the end because of his choice of the wrong method.</p>

  <p>Once he put the demonic life vitality in the weapon refining furnace, Zheng controlled the demonic life vitality to cover the treasured sword.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>The magma in the underground fire vein slowly flowed through the passage under the furnace. And through the heat conductor, it transmitted the high temperature upward.</p>

  <p>The treasured sword was placed in the furnace and began to bake owing to the magma's heat. It needed to maintain a certain temperature during the refining process, and the temperature in the furnace was just right, not too high or low.</p>

  <p>After the demonic life vitality covered it, the first drop of the heavenly essence was supported by the life vitality as it dripped on the treasured sword's blade.</p>

  <p>When the first drop dripped on the sword's blade, a metal coloured riffle formed on the bright and smooth blade. The riffle didn't spread to a large range but only an inch and then stopped, leaving a strange pattern on the blade.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a second drop of the heavenly essence dripped on the blade and left another small pattern.</p>

  <p>More and more drops of heavenly essence fell on the blade like the pristine drops of rain leaving behind one and another pattern.</p>

  <p>At the moment, in a continuous movement the heavenly essence from Zheng's ring was transmitted into the weapon refining furnace through the channel made of the demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>If some famous weapon refiners saw how Zheng wasted the heavenly essence in this way, they would most probably get furious.</p>

  <p>How the immensely valuable heavenly essence was getting wasted!</p>

  <p>Most often, the heavenly essence was used to refine the weapon at the most crucial part. As it was said, you must use the best material at the key point to make the best of everything.</p>

  <p>If they used the heavenly essence to refine a sword, it could only be used on the blade. If the heavenly essence was not enough, they might put it exactly on the edge of the blade following the saying.</p>

  <p>Even though some effect of the heavenly essence would be lost, the effect would be better than that of a stick in the eye.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't have the knowledge to economize and micromanage. He almost let the heavenly essence drip randomly, so it not only fell on the blade but also filled the sword's handle.</p>

  <p>But even this treasured sword couldn't absorb the heavenly essence infinitely. There was a limit, which depended on the weapon refiner's attainment.</p>

  <p>Zheng put hundreds of heavenly essence drops in the weapon refining furnace in one go. The whole treasured sword was covered with the heavenly essence. From the blade to the handle and even the top, it was absorbing all that it could. It was saturated in heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>Till now, Zheng withdrew the heavenly essence which was not absorbed from the weapon refining furnace and made it return into his space ring.</p>

  <p>The refining process was almost over and it took a short duration of somewhere around thirty minutes.</p>
