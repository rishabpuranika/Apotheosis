<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1696 The Circle Of Life And Death </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't considered that he would meet Shania in the very first battle of the remaining five warriors.</p>

  <p>Previously, Shania had asked him to hand over the Saint Killing Spear to her.</p>

  <p>She had even said that he would, without a doubt, be returning the Saint Killing Spear to her. Made cautious by her request, Luo Zheng had gripped the spear tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>What on earth was her reason for wanting the spear?</p>

  <p>After all, the spear was Xun's weapon, so Luo Zheng definitely wouldn't be giving it to someone else. He would bring it out of the Illusion Battlefield and return it to Xun. However, he still wanted to know why Shania had said that, for it smacked of prophesy.</p>

  <p>He jumped down from the stone and landed on the board, ready to engage in the battle.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Shania also took gentle steps forward, seeming to descend upon an invisible staircase.</p>

  <p>As she reached the board, she gave Luo Zheng a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>"Can you now give me the Saint Killing Spear?" Shania asked again, still smiling.</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" Luo Zheng replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>Once, he had formed a singular impression of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, it was one of the most accomplished races in the universe, with perfect order reigning throughout its territories.</p>

  <p>But because of what happened to Amber and Hailey, Luo Zheng harbored hostility towards the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Right now, Amber was still being bitterly tortured, and once Hailey had returned from the Illusion Battlefield, her end would probably not be any better.</p>

  <p>The battle between the two Demon Night queens had caused too many losses for their race.</p>

  <p>"Should I need a reason for that? I merely want to exchange something with you," Shania confidently said, with an expectant tone of voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Luo Zheng laughed coldly. "What do you want to exchange for the Saint Killing Spear?"</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was the most powerful spear in the universe!</p>

  <p>It might not have reached its full potential in Zheng's hands, but in Xun's capable hands, it could emit an endless amount of power.</p>

  <p>All the supreme divine weapons were priceless treasures, so what could Shania possibly hope to give Luo Zheng in exchange?</p>

  <p>Many people pricked their ears at the exchange. They were curious to know what Shania would offer in exchange for the unattainable spear.</p>

  <p>However, Shania slightly parted her lips and spoke to Luo Zheng only using her life vitality, "A perfect spirit embryo. It has been growing in the Pool of Faith of the Queen of Life for many years. If Xun knew that I offered you the spirit embryo in exchange, I believe that she would definitely give up the spear!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's brow creased at her words.</p>

  <p>If she had offered anything else, he would immediately have rejected it without a second thought.</p>

  <p>But she offered a perfect spirit embryo!</p>

  <p>The faith collected in each of the Pools of Faith of the three queens was different in nature.</p>

  <p>Xun's Pool of Faith was formed by the killing intent of the members of the Demon Night race. As a result, it was blood-red in color.</p>

  <p>It was said that the dense killing intent could be felt at a distance of ten thousand miles from the Pool of Faith. Ordinary beings couldn't safely approach within a thousand miles around it, and even Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors couldn't withstand the killing intent within a hundred miles. Only Soul Sea Realm warriors had the strength to stand within ten miles around the Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>The Pool of Faith of the Queen of Life was in pale green color, and it was filled with endless life energy.</p>

  <p>If wounded warriors approached that pool, no matter how serious their injuries were, they would fully recover in a short period of time. At times their healing was even instantaneous.</p>

  <p>What Xun desired most right now was a physical body.</p>

  <p>A spirit embryo, which had been born from the Pool of Faith of the Queen of Life would be perfect for her.</p>

  <p>But this offer hinged on Luo Zheng having to give up the Saint Killing Spear in exchange for the spirit embryo.</p>

  <p>"The spirit embryo is a perfect body of the Demon Night race. Though the Saint Killing Spear is undoubtedly a powerful weapon, it is merely a worldly possession," Shania continued coaxing, while still speaking privately to Luo Zheng with her life vitality. She had noticed Zheng's expression change and had become hopeful.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered uncertainly. He continued to probe, "Only the Queen of Killings can exert the full potential of the Saint Killing Spear. What do you want it for?"</p>

  <p>Shania was silent for a moment. Clearly, she was unwilling to disclose the real reason to Luo Zheng. She only said, "Truly, it is very important to me."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Zheng pressed for information.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. I can't tell you that." Shania was becoming slightly angry at his interrogation of her. "I'm merely inquiring whether you want to trade."</p>

  <p>"Don't even think about it!" A sly smile was revealed on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was powerful, but most of the Demon Night clansmen were unable to fully wield its immense power. Shania definitely had another, possibly nefarious, goal in mind.</p>

  <p>She had promised that there was a perfect spirit embryo in the Pool of Faith of the Queen of Life, and Luo Zheng had initially believed her words, but even if he relinquished the spear to her right here, would she honor the agreement and send the spirit embryo over?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not born yesterday. He had already made up his mind to immediately reject Shania's offer. At the same time, he had tried to glean some useful information from her.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, she was tight lipped and unwilling to reveal her purpose.</p>

  <p>She had used her life force, and she became a Godly Genius, who had suddenly appeared in the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had previously speculated about her background. Perhaps this was all part of the Queen of Life's plan, since she had always kept silent before.</p>

  <p>But what did she really want? Would Xun be put in danger by this plan? Right now, Luo Zheng couldn't even guess at the answers, but he decided to be careful.</p>

  <p>Once he returned to the outside world, he could plan a course of action with Xun. If Xun was willing to give the Saint Killing Spear up, then it wouldn't be too late for him to do that at that point.</p>

  <p>He did not know that Shania, who was standing before him, was in fact Ying, the Queen of Life herself.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng refused Shania's request, her beautiful eyebrows furrowed slightly, and her Mu Ning became knife edged.</p>

  <p>She was like an angry female tiger fixed to the spot and ready to pounce as she stared at Luo Zheng. Then she said, "Are you really going to pass the chance of getting the spirit embryo?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I'm pretty sure about that," Luo Zheng said with a relaxed smile, ignoring her tense stance and challenging tone.</p>

  <p>Shania then snorted lightly, "Well then."</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng didn't want to trade, she would not waste her breath any further on trying to convince him.</p>

  <p>As the two were conversing, a few martial artists outside the painting did not know what was going on and began to speculate about what the two were discussing.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me that Shania has also fallen in love with Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"To be honest, many girls like him."</p>

  <p>"No wonder Cindy used her peach blossoms to lure Luo Zheng into her dream."</p>

  <p>While they were still discussing among themselves, Shania and Luo Zheng had concluded their own parlay without any chance for a deal. Then, Shania suddenly launched an attack on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In her previous duels, she had used her life force to germinate all kinds of strange plants from all over the universe to contend with her enemies.</p>

  <p>But now, she had changed her approach. She sneered and said, "I have always felt that the power of life is the purest form of power, because it can give birth to all things and bring life to anything."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she extended both her hands with her fingers spread to the sky.</p>

  <p>Her left hand was white and lush with life, and every inch of her skin radiated with a pale green light, exuding a strong sense of creation. That Mu Ning was incredibly sweet like nectar, and Luo Zheng could feel a refreshing sensation filled with vitality in just one breath.</p>

  <p>The other hand was covered in grey skin, which was shriveled and seemed almost withered. The creases and wrinkles on it simultaneously emitted a black Mu Ning of death, while the stench of decay faintly spread among the warriors.</p>

  <p>Her two hands displayed two completely different sides of life.</p>

  <p>Life was always accompanied by death.</p>

  <p>Myriads of lives were in a constant cycle of life and death.</p>

  <p>Apart from life force, the Life Law contained many profound mysteries related to death.</p>

  <p>Thus, those warriors, who cultivated the Life Law, were the ones who understood life and death the best.</p>

  <p>Shania was somewhat vexed.</p>

  <p>She didn't want to end this battle so easily, as she felt that Luo Zheng required a lesson in respect for his betters.</p>

  <p>If they had been in the outside world, she might have chosen to drain Luo Zheng of his lifespan and seal off his lifeline, thereby preventing him from extending his lifespan. This way, he would have entered the Five Aging Processes in advance, and he would have lived the rest of his life aging prematurely. This was the worst possible fate that a warrior could face.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they were in the Illusion Battlefield, so this method was completely useless.</p>

  <p>Thus, she chose an even crueler method.</p>

  <p>"The Circle of Life and Death!"</p>

  <p>In truth, a few Supreme Lords had already figured out Shania's true identity, but they were still a bit unsure.</p>

  <p>After all, the cost of reincarnation was just too high. The risks of doing so were extremely high, and the Supreme Lords couldn't figure out the reason why Ying would want to participate in the Illusion Battlefield in the first place.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Shania use this method, those who were familiar with the Queen of Life knew for certain who she was.</p>

  <p>Shania was Ying, the Queen of Life!</p>

  <p>"She already uses such a powerful move at the very beginning of their battle."</p>

  <p>"With Zheng's unstable mind, he will suffer bitterly in the Circle of Life and Death."</p>

  <p>"There aren't many people who can survive through that, but if he succeeds, he will benefit a lot."</p>

  <p>There was a clear line that existed between life and death.</p>

  <p>One side of the line was death, and the other side was life. This was an immutable truth that all living creatures accepted.</p>

  <p>However, once one mastered the eighth layer of the Life Law, he or she would be able to accurately manipulate that line.</p>

  <p>It allowed for the creation of illusion between life and death, and now that was going to be used on Luo Zheng.</p>
