<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the green-colored flames were quite a distance away, Zheng was still able to see them clearly.</p>

  <p>The flames took human shapes and wore sturdy armors. Green flames spurted out from all the parts that weren't covered by their armors.</p>

  <p>Noticing Zheng's unusual behavior, Feng Ge also turned and saw the three human-shaped flames. Her face turned pale in an instant as she caught sight of them.</p>

  <p>They weren't certain about the origins of the human-shaped flames, but even with their distance, they could still feel the tremendous power emanating from these creatures. Feng Ge couldn't help but take a few steps back because of fear.</p>

  <p>"Grrr!"</p>

  <p>A dragon-shaped Hidden Beast roared somewhere behind them.</p>

  <p>Extremely surprised, Feng Ge lost her balance as she tried to quickly turn.</p>

  <p>Before she fell, Zheng immediately held her waist and helped her regain her balance. "Don't be afraid," Zheng said softly as he tried to calm her.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge nodded, though it was obvious that she was still in a state of shock.</p>

  <p>She actually had complete trust in Zheng, but she just couldn't shake off her fear and anxiousness of being trapped between the Hidden Spirit Lamps and the three unknown creatures.</p>

  <p>After calming Feng Ge, Zheng asked the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 about the origin of the human-shaped flames.</p>

  <p>This time, both of them seemed to know the answer. They had enough knowledge about the human-shaped flames.</p>

  <p>"These creatures are born in the flames. They belong to the Element Spirit race," the Regal Jade Spirit answered.</p>

  <p>"They are called the Moon Fire Slaves. Among the members of the Element Spirit race, these creatures are very powerful warriors," No. 9527 added.</p>

  <p>"What's strange is that they usually appear in the higher stages. What are they doing here in Stage Seventeen?"</p>

  <p>After listening to No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit, Zheng concluded,</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing that could explain this: the Element Spirit race must have been informed of our arrival."</p>

  <p>"You're right. It was the Elephant Man race," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Back on the grassland, Zheng surmised that the Elephant Man race was probably a group of spies for some large race. It seemed that his guess was indeed correct.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, though the Moon Fire Slaves are very powerful, their strength has been greatly suppressed after they entered this stage. However…" No. 9527 paused abruptly.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng quickly asked.</p>

  <p>"Their strength might be suppressed, but they still have tremendous life energy. It would still be very difficult to kill them," No. 9527 explained.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still asking for more information about the Moon Fire Slaves when the three human-shaped flames seemed to have already discovered them.</p>

  <p>"I have a visual of the targets. The Elephant Men didn't lie," No. 12 reported.</p>

  <p>"But these Hidden Spirit Lamps are hindering us," No. 13 said as he looked at the lamp posts.</p>

  <p>"Humph! How powerful can the Hidden Spirit Lamps in Stage Seventeen be? Hey, No. 14! Kill them but remember to keep their hands intact!" No.</p>

  <p>12 ordered in a stern voice.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves knew that the Other Shore Key was on one of the hands of Zheng or Feng Ge. Their trip to Stage Seventeen was for this very purpose.</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>No. 14 briefly hesitated.</p>

  <p>Before they had come down to this stage, they had also heard about its current situation.</p>

  <p>The place wasn't as simple as it looked. Moreover, the injuries inflicted by the Hidden Beasts were settled together. No. 14 thought that it probably wasn't a wise choice to rush things and act rashly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be such a wimp! You won't die. Besides, I want to see the strength of these Hidden Beasts," No. 12 argued.</p>

  <p>"Or we can extinguish the Hidden Spirit Lamps first," No. 14 asserted in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Don't test my patience!" No. 12 was getting annoyed at No. 14's dilly-dallying.</p>

  <p>Despite his resistance, No. 14 couldn't disobey No. 12. No. 14 couldn't do anything but bite the bullet as he rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>Just as No. 14 was close enough to the Hidden Spirit Lamps, the Hidden Beasts that were tied to the lamp posts rushed to him right away.</p>

  <p>Giant dogs, wolves, tigers, leopards…</p>

  <p>Vicious creatures in various forms rabidly bit and clawed at No. 14 continuously.</p>

  <p>The injuries caused by the Hidden Beasts weren't settled immediately, hence only leaving traces of gray scars upon the body of No. 14.</p>

  <p>It actually took Zheng an hour to go from the entrance to the center of the round desert. To get rid of the injuries that he had suffered, he needed to get in and out repeatedly, which was why it took him a lot of time.</p>

  <p>However, being pressured by No. 12, No. 14 rushed into the inner layer of the round desert disregarding the injuries that would accumulate. In just a few seconds, the Moon Fire Slave was just about a thousand feet away from Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Stand behind me," Zheng calmly instructed Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Not far from them, a huge dragon-shaped Hidden Beast was intently staring at them.</p>

  <p>Zheng took about two steps forward while exercising full caution.</p>

  <p>At the same time, even at a distance of more than a thousand feet, Zheng could still feel the burning aura of the Moon Fire Slave. The green flames that were oozing out from his body were terrifying, but there was no hint of fear in Zheng's eyes. After all, he couldn't be harmed by fire. However, Feng Ge was relatively weak against it. That was why Zheng was determined to finish off the Moon Fire Slave as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>As the Moon Fire Slave got closer and closer, the heat waves being emitted were also getting stronger.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, it's so hot. I don't think I can take it anymore."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was in a total pinch as she had nowhere to go. The Moon Fire Slave was getting closer in front, and the dragon-shaped Hidden Beast was just about a foot behind her.</p>

  <p>As the Moon Fire Slave cut the distance of about five hundred feet, Feng Ge suddenly felt like her body was being cut by a knife and her hair was being engulfed by fire. She couldn't help but scream in agony.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Zheng gritted his teeth and clenched his fists. He couldn't wait anymore. He had to stop the Moon Fire Slave from approaching further, or Feng Ge would really be burnt by the flames.</p>

  <p>However, just as Zheng was about to rush over, the approaching Moon Fire Slave suddenly trembled and halted.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, an extremely terrifying force burst out from his body.</p>

  <p>The armor worn by No. 14 was instantly shattered. His mountain-like body collapsed and his flames were extinguished. The broken armor scattered all over the ground.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" Zheng was a little confused and stunned.</p>

  <p>As the scorching waves disappeared, Feng Ge was finally able to breathe properly. There was a sigh of relief as she fixed her charred hair. "How could he die all of a sudden?" Feng Ge asked as she caught her breath.</p>

  <p>"His injuries must have been settled!" Zheng's face brightened up as he realized what happened.</p>

  <p>According to the Regal Jade Spirit, if they were attacked by the Hidden Beasts, the injuries accumulated would only be settled after they retreated a certain distance.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that there was more than one way for the injuries to be settled.</p>

  <p>No. 14's framework was huge and he didn't bother dodging any attack made by the Hidden Beasts.</p>

  <p>As he rushed to Zheng's location, several attacks from the Hidden Beasts accumulated on his body.</p>

  <p>"I guess when the power of the Hidden Beasts' attacks reaches a fatal limit, it will be automatically settled," Zheng told the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>"That should be it."</p>

  <p>"I agree!"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit affirmed Zheng's deduction.</p>

  <p>In the distance, No. 12 and No. 13 were standing still. Their angry faces were outlined by the flames in their helmets.</p>

  <p>"Really? Only half the distance, and No. 14 was killed," No. 12 uttered in surprise.</p>

  <p>"We can't take any more chances. We need to extinguish the lamps first before we chase them," No. 13 urged.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Moon Fire Slaves were tough creatures. For now, No. 14 had died, but they still had a way to bring him back to life later.</p>
