  <p>
</p>

  <p>These core disciples had all undergone the challenges of the Illusion Battlefield. After their elimination, they were still able to witness the battles that went on through the painting scroll.</p>

  <p>The last three hundred people were born in the same era and were in the same realm as them; however, there was a big gap when it came to their strength.</p>

  <p>These were Godly Geniuses whose names echoed throughout the entire universe. They were the elite of this worst era and everyone looked up to them for salvation. They were the ones that the Supreme Lords all cherished and cared for as much as they could.</p>

  <p>So it was understood that their presence here shook everyone's heart to the core.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a loud explosion as Luo Luo Zheng crashed onto the ground. He still had the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand and sent out sword energy all over the place.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng forcefully activated the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike's sword radiance and looked like a golden hedgehog in the process.</p>

  <p>The radiance pushed back a portion of the small skulls millions of feet away. It would take them a long time if they were to fly back.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was only able to push a few of them and the majority still rushed towards Preston.</p>

  <p>"Multiple Stars Brilliance!"</p>

  <p>Starlight flickered around Luo Zheng's body as he released an explosive force.</p>

  <p>The powerful shock waves caused many of the Pure Jade Sacred Place's disciples to lose their balance. Some were even lifted off the ground by 20 to 30 feet and fell heavily onto the ground again. However, this kind of impact was nothing for the warriors of the Soul Sea Realm. The more powerful Luo Luo Zheng was, the better their chances of survival.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of small skulls shot out again in all directions due to the powerful impact exerted upon them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Because of the impact, some of the skulls launched into the air, all the way towards the sky. They had essentially turned into lethal weapons as the kingdom rulers watching from above immediately dodged the oncoming projectiles lest they get hurt.</p>

  <p>A few collided with the buildings and left them riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>Unsurprisingly, many grand monuments and exquisite royal sculptures were also shattered in the process.</p>

  <p>The trouble, however, was that despite being pushed back so violently, the skulls still turned around to come back towards them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had carried several hundred skulls on his back when he was in the Illusion Battlefield. He too tried every means to get rid of them but failed.</p>

  <p>"Tianming!" he called out to Tianming for help.</p>

  <p>On the way there, he and Tianming had discussed what to do with these small skulls.</p>

  <p>Lucille, Nathan, and the others knew that the most troublesome part about these creatures was their curses. Even some Supreme Lords were at a loss how to fight back.</p>

  <p>Tianming, however, looked quite relaxed and told Luo Luo Zheng that he might be able to deal with the curses.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gaze landed on him.</p>

  <p>He pulled out his Soaring Snake Sword and stabbed it into the ground.</p>

  <p>Huff...</p>

  <p>A dazzling light encircled the blade.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the entire place was engulfed by this light.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only push back a portion of the skulls. There were some that still managed to break through the Sky Demon Eliminating Array and bite Preston along with a couple of core disciples. They were unable to resist since their life vitality had long since been exhausted.</p>

  <p>However, the dazzling light Tianming emitted did something strange to those skulls.</p>

  <p>The skulls that gnawed on the disciples suddenly stopped and turned to look at this light. It was as if they were moths drawn to a flame as they slowly began to float towards it.</p>

  <p>Even the ones Luo Luo Zheng had pushed back were sucked in by this light and circled around the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>A bird's eye view revealed a whirlpool of skulls that rotated around the blade.</p>

  <p>Nathan, Lawson, and Lucille were also quite amazed by the sight.</p>

  <p>"Tianming, how did you do it?" Lucille asked.</p>

  <p>She had already come up with a back-up plan if Tianming failed to deal with these skulls and that was to use the shield of five elements. The skulls would eventually crush the shield, but it would take them at least eight to ten years to do so.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected Tianming to pull out a move like this.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her faintly. "The Soaring Snake Sword can dispel curses in the universe. Even the malicious Mu Ning in your body can be removed with a single slash."</p>

  <p>"Can you kill them? If we don't kill them, there will be hidden dangers," she said. A Supreme Lord once had skulls hanging on his body for three whole years before they disappeared.</p>

  <p>Tianming smiled confidently. "You'll see in a bit."</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses trusted him. Tianming's confidence was enough to let them know that he knew what he was doing.</p>

  <p>Preston stood up and slowly walked towards Tianming. He was about to express his gratitude when a graceful figure suddenly flew in the air and shot over.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had used up most of her life vitality, so even flying was difficult.</p>

  <p>In the end, she ended up falling right into Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was already waiting to catch her. As he held his wife, he could hear her painful sobs.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had never been afraid of death. As a warrior, she possessed the type of courage that defied the heavens and readily faced death head-on.</p>

  <p>When she was in charge of Cloud Hall, she completely ignored everything else and buried herself headfirst into her role.</p>

  <p>She didn't have much to worry about back then, but it was different now.</p>

  <p>There were far too many things she treasured in this life and she couldn't leave this world behind so easily anymore.</p>
