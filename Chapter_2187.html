<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2187 Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Divine Dao Tablets in the Consulting God Hall were arranged in an equidistant manner.</p>

  <p>The closer one was to the Divine Dao Tablets, the greater the impact they felt from the internal momentum. They were also able to communicate with the tablets better.</p>

  <p>Getting too close was a problem though. The internal momentum could get too much and injure the person. Proving godly warriors were vigilant in maintaining a safe, proper distance to these things to make sure that the internal momentum was within the limit that they could handle.</p>

  <p>Most of the proving godly warriors' souls were at the same level but the steps in front of the Divine Dao Tablets were narrow and the space was quite limited. Thus, the good spots were usually already taken by those who had come earlier, while those who came later could only take the places that were further to the Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed the winding road, passing through several Divine Dao Tablets and seeing a few other proving godly warriors gathered on the steps before those tablets.</p>

  <p>The proving godly warrior named Zane stood in front of the sixth Divine Dao Tablet on the right.</p>

  <p>The words on the tablet emitted a faint blue light and radiated a sharp chill.</p>

  <p>The chill didn't seem overwhelming, but Zane who stood beneath the tablet looked pale. He shivered with his teeth practically chattering as a layer of white frost engulfed his body.</p>

  <p>"Snow Divine Dao..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. This wasn't the Divine Dao he was looking for.</p>

  <p>He cultivated the Emotion Closing Divine Dao but since that was classified as forbidden within the divine land, then he figured that it might be difficult to find it within the Consulting God Hall. In fact, the number of Divine Dao here only took up around ten percent of the three thousand Divine Dao in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, since he was already here, Luo Luo Zheng figured that he might as well broaden his horizons. He wanted to see just how profound the internal momentum that the top-level True Gods comprehended was.</p>

  <p>The deeper into the Consulting God Hall he went, the fewer proving godly warriors he saw.</p>

  <p>Divine Dao Tablets placed near the entrance were the ones that most people cultivated. The deeper one went, the more obscure the Divine Dao were. These were usually the ones that were of the same power as other Divine Dao but more difficult to comprehend, thus leading to their unpopularity.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Luo Zheng finally found himself in front of a Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>This tablet emitted a strange, purple mist that transformed into various, unique shapes. Horses galloped around the tablet, eagles screeched and flew, and purple sword images constantly evolved into a myriad of sword arrays.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow furrowed at the sight. "This Mu Ning?."</p>

  <p>He was very familiar with it. It was the very same Mu Ning Mu Ning released when she operated the sword arrays.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, the only technique Mu Ning seemed to know was how to control sword arrays which was already an innate ability of her Purple Power Body. It was worth noting though that the Purple Power World was an independent world, merely controlling sword arrays was just scratching the surface of what a Purple Power Body could do.</p>

  <p>Yan also possessed the Purple Power Body but this should've been bestowed upon her by their father. Luo Luo Zheng briefly wondered whether she had comprehended any Divine Dao in the divine land. If she had, was the Divine Dao Luo Luo Zheng currently stared at the one she comprehended?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was intrigued by this Divine Dao Tablet and chose to climb up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The moment he set his foot on one of the steps, the internal momentum that emanated from the other Divine Dao Tablets was suddenly repelled by the internal momentum of this single purple Divine Dao Tablet, sweeping through Luo Luo Zheng and all that surrounded him.</p>

  <p>He was around twenty steps up when a woman in white suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>This woman was an elite disciple of some third-tier clan. He had already met her before and figured she was ranked at around forty since there were over forty warriors who walked past him before her earlier.</p>

  <p>She gave Luo Luo Zheng a faint smile when she passed by him. The girl exuded a shyness that added to her charm.</p>

  <p>"This is the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique, also known as the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao. Women are usually the only ones who can cultivate it as it requires a special physique," the woman in white said, a bit surprised to see Luo Luo Zheng walk over to her.</p>

  <p>"Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao? Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique," he repeated with a nod. He continued climbing up until he reached the place where the woman was.</p>

  <p>"Do you still want to go up?" There was a surprised look on the woman's face, not really understanding what Luo Luo Zheng was doing. The internal momentum on this Divine Dao Tablet was not something he could comprehend.</p>

  <p>The young man shrugged. "I just want to have a look. May I pass?"</p>

  <p>Still unclear of his intentions, the woman stood up and moved to the side, allowing Luo Luo Zheng to walk past her. "The internal momentum of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao is relatively mild but don't mistake that for weakness. If you get too close, the internal momentum will attack you." she told him, pointing at the purple mist that materialized from the tablet.</p>

  <p>Upon closer look, Luo Luo Zheng could more clearly make out the things the purple mist materialized into: a lion, a wolf, even a palace, and everything that one could imagine.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in understanding. "Thank you for informing me. I still want to see it a bit more clearly..."</p>

  <p>The woman made way for him and Luo Luo Zheng lightly tapped his toes and climbed up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Just as he steadied himself, he heard a loud rumble from behind him!</p>

  <p>Rumble?</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and the white-robed woman looked behind them only to see that a nearby Divine Dao Tablet had started shaking.</p>

  <p>On top of this particular tablet was a snow-white light where hexagonal crystals, the size of a washbasin, constantly swayed. At that moment, the light shot towards the roof of the Consulting God Hall!</p>

  <p>"It's the Snow Divine Dao! Someone is acknowledged by the Snow Divine Dao so soon..." the woman remarked in such a gentle voice.</p>

  <p>However, there was a trace of envy in her eyes. She cultivated the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao and naturally possessed the Purple Power Body. Had she been born in the Evolutionary Universe, then she would've been a top warrior. Unfortunately, she was born in a third-tier clan in the divine land. Resources were limited along with her exposure to all sorts of martial arts.</p>

  <p>"It's that guy called Zane," Luo Luo Zheng murmured, staring at the bottom to see Zane enveloped by the snow-white light.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Malloy's voice rang out. "Zane of the Han Clan has been acknowledged by the Snow Divine Dao..."</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the white-robed woman who was envious. Many of the proving godly warriors were also quite jealous of the fact that someone had already been acknowledged so quickly. Zane was originally ranked fifth and during the previous test, the height his White Jade Token reached was only second to Luo Zheng's. His acknowledgement wasn't really that much of a surprise.</p>

  <p>Now that Zane had been acknowledged by the Divine Dao Tablet, then everyone wondered about that guy called Tianxing.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors began to actively search for Luo Luo Zheng and quickly discovered him up top.</p>

  <p>"Why did that kid climb to the Divine Dao Tablet of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao only cultivated by women?"</p>

  <p>"No, that's not completely right? There's also a couple of men who possess the Purple Power Body," someone interjected. "However, they're pretty rare. Most of them are eunuchs."</p>

  <p>The warriors were all bewildered...</p>

  <p>A person who possessed a Purple Power Body emitted an Mu Ning different from ordinary warriors. The white-robed woman, for example, was the eldest daughter of the Xue Clan of the Six-Burden Region. The Xue Clan was only a third-tier clan but May, the woman, had already managed to reach the 41st rank by relying on her special physique.</p>

  <p>However, the other warriors had already seen Luo Luo Zheng and knew it was impossible for him to possess a Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't quite aware of the attention his actions had gotten. There was quite a distance between each Divine Dao Tablet so he didn't really hear what the other people were saying.</p>

  <p>Once the light from the Snow Divine Dao disappeared, Luo Luo Zheng shifted his gaze away and continued climbing up.</p>

  <p>May had previously tried to dissuade him from going up further but she understood that he was someone far stronger than her. If he insisted on pushing forward, then she naturally wouldn't be able to stop him.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng continued to climb, he got ever closer to the Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>As he did so, the purple mist that lingered around the tablet began to stir and surge.</p>

  <p>"Hooo... hooo... hooo..."</p>

  <p>The auras churned and transformed into dozens of sharp sword shadows, forming an ingenious sword array that shot towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Be careful..." May warned. She was well aware of Luo Zheng's power but being cautious never hurt anyone. The number of geniuses who perished due to their arrogance was way too high.</p>

  <p>However, when the sword array came towards him, Luo Luo Zheng didn't show any intention of dodging at all.</p>
