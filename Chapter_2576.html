<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"No. He's just a member of the Nine Li race. How can he bear the power of our blood?"</p>

  <p>"Idiot! Is someone who can pass the test an ordinary person?"</p>

  <p>"If he really can reach the other shore with his physical body and get what our master needs, then we would make great contributions. It wouldn't matter if we take the risk, right?"</p>

  <p>The brain masters began their discussion.</p>

  <p>In fact, these huge brain masters and the small brain units like No. 9527 represented the Chaos Ancient God. The consciousness of the Chaos Ancient God had already fallen asleep and these brain units maintained the operation of the brain.</p>

  <p>The brain masters used their consciousness to communicate with each other and their conversation was over in a flash.</p>

  <p>All of them took a vote and most of them decided to take the risk!</p>

  <p>Their order was transmitted through the light ring.</p>

  <p>While the flesh, bones, muscles, and even the veins of the huge Chaos Ancient God had degenerated, most of his blood marrow was hidden within the strong bones.</p>

  <p>Even the most powerful exiles couldn't break the bones, and so, no one could suck the blood marrow of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Just as ordered, the blood marrow in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower of the Nine Li race, also called the sixth rib, began to slowly flow.</p>

  <p>Every bone tower was a shelter for the exiles.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the exiles who made the cracks in the bone towers. They were left behind a long time ago and the exiles weren't capable of making them.</p>

  <p>Most of the cracks in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower were at the bottom of the tower, so all the members of the Nine Li race lived there.</p>

  <p>The cracks of the Torrent Bone Tower were mainly in the middle of the tower and the members of the Snake Goddess race could only stay there.</p>

  <p>The top of the Sky Spirit Bone Tower wasn't damaged and the blood marrow was preserved well. A part of that blood marrow rapidly flowed through the cracks of the bone and headed straight to Luo Zheng's direction!</p>

  <p>"The tenth share of blood wild bones! He should be fine. Instead of becoming weak, he'll become more powerful!"</p>

  <p>Giacomo extracted the last blood wild bones and poured them into the Cave of Wildness. It was only then that he breathed out a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Although he was worried about Luo Zheng, he came to the last tribulation. As long as Luo Zheng survived the Marrow Damaging Tribulation, his physical body would turn into the Nine Li Wild Body.</p>

  <p>There was great expectation as Luo Zheng's blood reached the imperial grade.</p>

  <p>What level could his Nine Li Wild Body achieve?</p>

  <p>"He can bear ten shares of blood wild bones. If I knew earlier, I would've given him a few more." Adele smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>That made Giacomo roll his eyes and thought that Adele was too greedy.</p>

  <p>Even for Luo Zheng, ten shares of blood wild bones were the maximum, and if there was even just one more, his body might collapse.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Adele suddenly looked up at the sky with a strange expression on her fair face.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? Grand Elder?" Giacomo asked.</p>

  <p>"The bone tower is shaking," muttered Adele.</p>

  <p>"What?" Giacomo was stunned. He focused on observing and quickly discovered that the ground was slightly shaking.</p>

  <p>The bone towers were the biggest things in the world.</p>

  <p>The length of each bone was as long as the divine land's length from east to west.</p>

  <p>Even if the Wild Gods could turn into giants thousands of miles tall, they were incomparable to the bones that were all trillions of miles long.</p>

  <p>Even more than that, the bone tower was so solid that no creatures including the exiles could shake it.</p>

  <p>It should be almost impossible but the bone tower suddenly began to tremble and made Adele and Giacomo feel extremely perplexed!</p>

  <p>"The wave caused by the tremor is getting stronger and is still moving."</p>

  <p>Adele squatted, her slender finger gently pressed on the ground. Her charming eyes stared forward. "And it's coming towards us!"</p>

  <p>Even if his perception of the outside world was far less acute than hers, Giacomo could also sense that something unknown was heading straight for them.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Giacomo asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>The bone tower was their shelter and it had always been a deathly still.</p>

  <p>In all their years, he had never encountered such a thing, so why did it suddenly become active today?</p>

  <p>Adele snapped to attention as she suddenly realized something. "Take Luo Zheng out of the Cave of Wildness! The wave is aimed at him!"</p>

  <p>Giacomo took a deep breath and was about to jump down the cave.</p>

  <p>Right when he took action, the cracks of the Cave of Wildness beneath their feet suddenly closed up.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was completely locked inside the cave.</p>

  <p>The loud noise attracted many people's attention.</p>

  <p>Elsa, Romeo, and the others all rushed out of other caves and stared in shock at the closed cave.</p>

  <p>"Why is it closed?" With his eyes as big as two bells, Baldwin looked at the scene in disbelief.</p>

  <p>His duty was to command people to extract and refine the Wild God Power and then infuse it into the Cave of Wildness. He was very familiar with these caves because they nurtured many talents of the Nine Li race for thousands of years.</p>

  <p>Although the Cave of Wildness was called a cave, it was actually made up of bone cracks of more than a hundred feet long. Why did this cave close? The other caves remained open except for the Cave of Wildness where Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The tremors continued to wrack through the bone tower.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Several figures swiftly gathered.</p>

  <p>It was the Nine Li race's exiles who also sensed that power was constantly rushing to the cave.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Ramzi asked as he stared at his daughter.</p>

  <p>"The Cave of Wildness closed..." Leopold gasped.</p>

  <p>The oldest man stared at the closed cracks of the cave and his face had a dark frown. "I felt a unique power flowing in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>The power is gathering in the Cave of Wildness!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was puzzled when they heard the oldest man's words.</p>

  <p>Was there any other power in the bone tower? They had never heard of it!</p>

  <p>"Do you think the power in the bone tower is from the Chaos Ancient God?" Ramzi asked the old man.</p>

  <p>The oldest man looked at the closed Cave of Wildness in uncertainty.</p>

  <p>He just sensed that there was a power but even he didn't know whether the Chaos Ancient God was alive or not. A five-star Nine Li Guard like him couldn't figure out such a high level life.</p>
