  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not speak. He knew that he had probably reached his most dangerous moment.</p>

  <p>Retreat?</p>

  <p>He couldn't possibly have his soul leave his body and give up his shell, right?</p>

  <p>And since he couldn't retreat, his only option was to fight head on.</p>

  <p>Another silent collision. This time, Luo Luo Zheng unleashed the Spiritual Thorn.</p>

  <p>But the thorn that was formed from his own soul shattered instantly the moment it came in contact with the colorful will.</p>

  <p>The will of the world was not something that his current level of soul could resist. Perhaps even a soul at the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm would be unable to suppress the will of the world.</p>

  <p>A sense of despair rose in Luo Zheng's heart, clawing at his insides.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Despair, right? You are still too weak!" the little monster said in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, a roar echoed from the depths of Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>ROAR!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng realized that was the roar of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>"Cyan dragon..." Luo Zheng's brow creased slightly.</p>

  <p>Another roar accompanied the first; the red dragon had also awoken, sending a spine-chilling roar at the same time. They couldn't escape the mysterious furnace, but each of them roared and simultaneously launched an attack against the colorful will.</p>

  <p>At this, a deep sense of grief began to take over Luo Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>The souls of the cyan dragon and red dragon hadn't been repaired a lot.</p>

  <p>Before this, they had only swallowed an Owl Beast. If their souls had been at their best, they would probably have had the qualifications to contend with the will of the world. But not when they were in this state.</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>The two soul attacks swept towards the colorful will, and two more soundless collisions occurred.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, on the mysterious furnace, the colors of the cyan dragon's and the red dragon's bodies darkened quite a bit, and the will of the world only flickered once. It wasn't long before an even more gorgeous luster burst out and the little monster's voice sounded again,</p>

  <p>"Interesting! There's actually a furnace in your body. And what's wrong with these dragons? Aren't dragons super legendary beasts? Why are they so weak? Tsk-tsk!"</p>

  <p>Before he had even finished speaking, the will of the world struck Luo Luo Zheng yet again.</p>

  <p>After this collision, Luo Luo Zheng retreated again. He could feel his soul trembling and the number of cracks on the surface of his soul increasing. It felt like it would break apart at any time. And this time, it was truly a matter of life and death for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He probably wouldn't be able to make it through the next impact, causing despair to spread through him and appear starkly clear all over his face.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you beg for mercy? Of course, I won't let you off even if you do beg, but you should act according to your circumstances. Right, Luo Luo Zheng?" The little monster barked a sinister laugh.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't about to beg for mercy because he knew it was useless. So how could he compromise with the little monster? The despair on Luo Zheng's face was suddenly swept away at the little monster's words. Instead, a proud smile took its place. Even if he died, he would choose to die standing, not kneeling.</p>

  <p>"That expression! That expression makes me very unhappy!" the little monster said coldly as he saw the calm stubbornness on Luo Zheng's face. He chose to attack him directly.</p>

  <p>The will of the world shone brilliantly as it charged towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slowly closed his eyes. He knew his soul would probably dissipate in a few seconds.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, another soul rammed into the will of the world. This soul's ferocity seemed to be no inferior to the will of the world, forcefully pushing the will of the world away from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes, a tinge of sadness evident in them. "Xun!"</p>

  <p>Xun's soul had been nourished by the holy tree of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. However, she only had a sliver of her soul left.</p>

  <p>Even though it had grown stronger with the nourishment, it still wasn't able to resist the colorful will.</p>

  <p>Xun's soul also dimmed, and cracks began to appear on its surface too. But she said to Luo Luo Zheng firmly, "You can't die."</p>

  <p>"But..." Luo Luo Zheng had wanted to say that he truly had no way to resist the will of the world.</p>

  <p>Not only him, but that there was no one in the entire world could possibly resist this will. Although the little monster wasn't utilizing the whole of the will of the world, just using this part was more than enough to kill him.</p>

  <p>Xun said in a cold voice, "Josh, right? And now, you're still hiding that thing, unwilling to use it even if your own soul is damaged?"</p>

  <p>"Using this thing involves a lot. They already noticed it when we tried to refine Luo Zheng's soul last time. If we use it again, I'm afraid..." the cyan dragon replied worriedly.</p>

  <p>But Xun wasn't giving up. "Survival is most important! Trust me, Luo Luo Zheng is the most suitable candidate!" she said seriously.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was from the Genuine Dragon World, and Xun was from the Demon Night. These two worlds were so far apart that the Genuine Dragons and the Demon Night members were not familiar with each other. However, the cyan dragon and Xun were both famous figures in the Upper World, and they had heard of each other before.</p>

  <p>Right now, their remnant souls lived inside Luo Zheng's body, and they were placing all their hopes on him.</p>

  <p>At Xun's words, the cyan dragon went silent for a while, and then replied firmly, "You're right. Since we've already come this far, I should believe in Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>At this, the gigantic, mysterious furnace in the depths of Luo Zheng's mind suddenly began to spin, causing its lid to slowly start opening.</p>

  <p>The black flames within the mysterious furnace appeared simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"What...what is this?" The little monster panicked when he saw this.</p>

  <p>Just a glance at the black flames frightened the little monster. It was as if the black flames could destroy everything. Even the heavens and earth were no exception!</p>

  <p>Although the little monster was rather arrogant, he had grown up in the Seven Water Forest, and his habits were similar to those of wild beasts? he was very sensitive to danger. The moment he saw the mysterious furnace and the black flames, he knew something was not right.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's soul was so close that he could kill him with just another attack, due to his instinctive fear and caution, the little monster chose to retreat at such a crucial moment.</p>

  <p>The colorful will began to retreat rapidly, wanting to break away from Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape? Too late," the cyan dragon said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a ray of seven-colored light shot out from the mysterious furnace. As the ray of light gently swept across, it sucked the will of the world into it in a flash of light.</p>

  <p>Xun's soul had become very weak, but when she saw this, she gave Luo Luo Zheng a broad smile. "After refining the will of the world, you can absorb it. If the absorption goes well, you will inherit the will of the world and become the son of the plane."</p>

  <p>As Xun spoke, Luo Zheng's cracked soul floated towards her. He hugged her tightly.</p>

  <p>Two broken souls embraced each other in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Xun was astonished at Luo Zheng's embrace. Her fiery red eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Then she pursed her lips and closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>The mysterious furnace was still spinning slowly. After all, it was the will of the world. Even if this furnace wanted to completely refine it, it wouldn't be easy.</p>

  <p>On the square, everyone was staring blankly at the sky. Luo Luo Zheng and the little monster were motionless, as if they were engaged in a soul battle.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng already displayed the strength of his soul. His soul is not weaker than that of a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. But the little monster is really confident. He actually dares to use his soul to suppress Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"But didn't you see the Mu Ning the little monster was emitting just now?</p>

  <p>This guy isn't human at all. I feel that he just represented the entire world. What kind of nonsense did the little monster train in?"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the sky fearfully as they quietly waited for the outcome of the battle.</p>
