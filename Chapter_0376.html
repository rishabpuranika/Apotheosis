<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 376 Heaven-Fire Killing Array (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng entered another space after the magic array engulfed him.</p>

  <p>Inside, it was extremely hot. The parched earth was full of cracks, like the wrinkles on the face of a ninety-year-old woman. Luo Luo Zheng looked around and saw several fire pits surrounding him.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Mack was floating in the sky, smiling hideously.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, I love seeing my enemies suffer more than anything else. Seeing your face burn will cheer me. Your skin will feel scorched, and your face will be a mess. Your pain will excite me the most. Ha-ha! Now, I'm gonna burn every part of your body, and soon, you'll beg for mercy."</p>

  <p>Lights flickered on the magic array tablet. Then, the fire pits surrounding Luo Luo Zheng were refueled, and a burning smell filled the air.</p>

  <p>"Are these illusions? Is Mack an illusion?" Luo Luo Zheng stood quietly and kept a sharp lookout. He wouldn't act till he figured out how this magic killing array worked.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Flames erupted from the countless fire pits and flew into the sky. Then, dozens of stone men crawled from the fire pits.</p>

  <p>The stone men were burning red, and flames could be seen extending behind their backs as if they were red cloaks that stretched into the sky.</p>

  <p>The?stone?men?stood and then ran toward Luo Luo Zheng. As the air became hotter, Luo Luo Zheng felt as though his face was being scorched.</p>

  <p>"The force of this Heaven-Fire killing array is formidable! I intended to advance from the group competitions while hiding my real strength and only using my body as my weapon. However, disciples of Cloud Sect are much stronger than regular warriors from the outer world."</p>

  <p>Ordinary warriors who had reached the pinnacle of the nature level stood no chance to defeat him. However, Mack did impose a significant threat to Luo Luo Zheng. Apparently, Luo Luo Zheng made a mistake by under-estimating disciples from Cloud Sect. They weren't like the weak warriors from the other parts of Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>The stone men's footsteps echoed. As they approached, Luo Luo Zheng finally responded.</p>

  <p>The magic killing array, if created by some real masters, could lower the martial arts abilities of the people inside it. On top of that, the gravity inside the magical land could also be changed so that opponents couldn't walk, let alone fight or defend themselves.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Mack had a long way to go, and his arrays had a weakness. Luo Luo Zheng rushed to one of the stone men.</p>

  <p>Since the burning stone men were nothing but stones, Luo Luo Zheng planned to smash them one by one with his fists.</p>

  <p>However, as he approached them, Luo Luo Zheng felt the temperature rising sharply.</p>

  <p>The heat was almost unbearable.</p>

  <p>"Go, before it's too late."</p>

  <p>Knowing that he couldn't resist the crushing heat, Luo Luo Zheng had to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I'm the God inside my magic killing array. I made the stone men, and they exist in my illusions. I imagined that they are made of falling stones from the sky. The fires are heaven fire, not regular fire.</p>

  <p>There's no escaping this, although it's said that your body is indestructible." Mack laughed coldly.</p>

  <p id="top_9">"Are?you the God in your magic array?" asked Luo Luo Zheng. A sardonic grin lit up Luo Zheng's face. "Don't be a damn fool. You set this incredible magic array.</p>

  <p>I will give you that. But you're weak, and this is all that you can achieve.</p>

  <p>I'm sorry, but you lack imagination," he added.</p>

  <p>A magic array master could set a magic array. But its power was limited, as it depended on the strength of its creator.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense. Die!" Mack?stretched his hand and pointed a finger at the burning stone men. In the next instant, they quickened their steps and moved toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing?the looming threat, Luo Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and rushed to one of them.</p>

  <p>Although the heaven fire burning on those stone men's bodies was intense, Luo Zheng's body was extremely strong. It was equivalent to a mid-grade spiritual weapon and capable of resisting such kind of fire.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lashed out at the burning stone man closest to him. His fist penetrated its body, and a hole appeared. Seconds later, the hole became bigger, and many narrow cracks formed.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The stone man shattered.</p>

  <p>Mack uttered a heart-rending cry.</p>

  <p>Some of his spirit had been put into the stone men. When Luo Luo Zheng smashed one of the stone men, Mack felt the pain and screamed.</p>

  <p>"They're weak, just like you. I'm gonna smash them one by one."</p>

  <p>The fire left Luo Luo Zheng feeling miserable, even though no real harm was caused to his body. He could bear more considerable pain than this.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng moved quickly and killed another two stone men within seconds.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could turn and attack another stone man, he heard Mack shout, "Flame of meteorite, in my name, please burn everything!</p>

  <p>Explode!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was confused and hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>Then, he saw the stone man explode. Since he was standing in front of the stone man, Luo Luo Zheng was engulfed by the fire.</p>

  <p>"You killed four of my stone men. That's quite impressive. Even practitioners at the Illuminating Soul Realm can't do that. But it is a joke that you're so confident and that you believe you can beat me," Mack? said to Luo Luo Zheng and smiled coldly, as he floated in the sky.</p>

  <p>The fire crackled on the ground. A long time passed before the fire finally died out.</p>

  <p>The magic killing array could create illusions and use them to kill people inside. While people trapped in the array could get hurt, it wasn't their body that got damaged, but their spirit.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng were burned to death inside the magic killing array, his soul could be severely wounded, and he would become an idiot.</p>

  <p>"Burn, burn! After you know nothing and remember nothing, I'll take you out of this killing array. Then, I'll teach you how to behave yourself.</p>

  <p>Ha-ha!" He smiled. Mack could imagine the tremendous pain being inflicted on Luo Luo Zheng. He imagined Luo Luo Zheng was burning alive, and begging for mercy desperately. He would be like a fish thrown into a frying pan, and only death awaited him.</p>

  <p>When the fire finally died out, a figure appeared. His body emitted a golden light, like a God. He looked intimidating.</p>

  <p>Mack didn't expect this. His pupils dilated as if he had seen a ghost.</p>
