  <p>Kennan's attitude was firm.</p>

  <p>His only goal was the protection of the princess.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had made it known that he would kill the princess just to rattle him. If this was just any normal situation, Kennan would have already killed him.</p>

  <p>It was obvious he wasn't from here. From the looks of it, he might have come from someplace inferior to the divine land. Nonetheless, Kennan considered him as nothing important. He wanted to end this.</p>

  <p>But Kennan was smart, too. He didn't dare to act recklessly while the Formless Sky Python was on his tail.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, too, remained calm.</p>

  <p>The higher the profit one desired, the higher the risk one had to face.</p>

  <p>This was the basic principle.</p>

  <p>Although the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was a completely independent world, it had potential to bring great benefits to martial artists. For some, they could condense their Godly Tiles here and become True Gods. However, the risk involved would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew he could die if he wasn't careful.</p>

  <p>He would be either swallowed up by the beast, or get killed by the two world lords. These two were powerful, and they never held back. That day in the great world, it had been hard for even a handful of Godly Geniuses to fight against the grand sorcerer. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had to face the two world lords, he didn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>"Kennan, how dare you disobey me!" The princess was furious as ever.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, as long as Kennan made the right move, the guy before her could never escape.</p>

  <p>Rolling his eyes, Kennan held a divine texture in his hand. The Formless Sky Python behind them was getting closer and closer. He was planning to use the Sky Defensive Divine Texture to block it.</p>

  <p>But before he could do anything, the princess had already lost all patience. "I'll get him myself."</p>

  <p>She possessed a cultivation at the peak of the Spirit Transformation Realm, and she could be considered almost a world lord. Facing Luo Luo Zheng who was at the Spirit Supreme Realm, she knew what she had to do to take him down.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With an oiled paper umbrella suddenly in her hands, she leapt into the air.</p>

  <p>This was her secret weapon.</p>

  <p>Historically, umbrella weapons were relatively rare, and the one in the princess's hand had in particular possessed ultimate powers.</p>

  <p>The princess leaped up agilely and landed gracefully and firmly on the back of the unicorn, then she shook the umbrella with all her might.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The umbrella spread open.</p>

  <p>"Sky Soul Cover!"</p>

  <p>The moment the umbrella opened, an umbrella-shaped ray of light emerged above Luo Zheng's head, coming down at him.</p>

  <p>A sharp beam flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes as his desire to kill was raging.</p>

  <p>The woman was coming after him but he knew he couldn't make a scene.</p>

  <p>If she came here looking for death, then she couldn't blame him for killing her.</p>

  <p>Before the Sky Soul Cover reached him, Luo Luo Zheng balled up in the air and a sharp sword radiance slashed straight at the Sky Soul Cover.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike! Wind Kill!"</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had completely comprehended the Gods-intimidating Strike, his comprehension of swordsmanship had reached a whole new level.</p>

  <p>The chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike he summoned was based on the Metal Law, that had combined the burst of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>However, he knew that the laws of this world weren't limited to Metal Law. Luo Luo Zheng had tried to fuse a variety of laws into the strike, trying to activate a much stronger power of chaotic energy. However, he failed.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy clashed with the other laws. He was unable to fuse two or more types of laws with the chaotic energy. The result of his attempt was that the chaotic energy had directly devoured the mixed two types of Law Power. Luo Luo Zheng had no idea why it would go like this.</p>

  <p>But despite the failure, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that when the Gods-intimidating Strike was fused with other types of laws, the effects were different according to laws that had been infused.</p>

  <p>For example, when fused with the Wind Law, it could spread the sword radiance endlessly. Moreover, both the speed of the strike and the angle at which the strike hit its target became unpredictable.</p>

  <p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh?</p>

  <p>The Sky Soul Cover was instantly destroyed by Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>The princess was left stunned. How could that have been too easy?</p>

  <p>She looked at her umbrella in dismay. It was from her father, and its attack was obliterated too quickly.</p>

  <p>Her weapon, the Solitary Star Umbrella, was a supreme primordial weapon.</p>

  <p>With the princess's cultivation level, she never missed her targets when she released the Sky Soul Cover, all except for world lords.</p>

  <p>She was still surprised by what just happened.</p>

  <p>Seeing the princess take the move, Kennan didn't stop her. Perhaps the young man in front of her had some ability, but he was still a lot weaker than her in terms of cultivation. Not to mention, the princess had a supreme primordial weapon!</p>

  <p>As he moved to form the Sky Defensive Divine Texture to block the Formless Sky Python, he knew that stopping the Formless Sky Python was their only chance to escape.</p>

  <p>Now that it had been chasing them, it would definitely wreak havoc on the land. If they didn't shake it off, some cities would definitely suffer.</p>

  <p>But before he could finish the Sky Defensive Divine Texture, the man in front of them severed the princess' Sky Soul Cover with a single sword strike.</p>

  <p>"His speed is amazing? Damn!"</p>

  <p>He had only finished half of the Sky Defensive Divine Texture but without any hesitation, he stopped the work he was doing.</p>

  <p>It was noticeable that a Sky Defensive Divine Texture would consume much of his energy. It was a waste of his energy and it wasn't easy for him to give up. But he knew which was more important, so he stopped and switched his attention. Since he had seen this young man's terrifying sword strike, he knew that if he did not act now, the Princess Royal would most likely die.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Kennan suddenly clapped his hands together, and a divine texture appeared and spread.</p>

  <p>An identical divine texture appeared in front of the princess, forming a black vortex.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng's second sword strike arrived and crashed into the black vortex.</p>

  <p>Hence, Kennan had successfully broken Luo Zheng's second strike using his divine texture.</p>

  <p>The princess was startled after realizing what had happened. Anger and frustration pierced through her eyes. She couldn't believe that this guy actually wanted to kill her.</p>

  <p>Kennan's expression darkened. If it was not for his quick thinking, the princess would have been dead by now.</p>

  <p>"Woodrow, take that kid down. I will continue to form the array!"</p>

  <p>Previously, Kennan hadn't intended to kill Luo Luo Zheng. He'd only treated him as someone insignificant.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was very cruel, and some races would kill any living thing they saw. But Kennan's group came from the divine land, so they had a superior mindset. They did not have any interest in killing weaker beings.</p>

  <p>But because this man put the princess at risk, it was a capital offense that couldn't be looked over.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man named Woodrow, also chose to take action after hearing Kennan's orders. With his cultivation of a world lord, it wouldn't be difficult for him to take down Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's body somersaulted in the air and changed directions once again.</p>

  <p>He was charging towards the princess.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was very clear about the current situation. Whether it was that enormous Formless Sky Python behind him, or the group of powerful masters, Luo Luo Zheng was no match for them.</p>

  <p>He knew he just had to take advantage of others to save himself.</p>

  <p>Although the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was extremely dangerous, he was completely baffled why he would get into such trouble.</p>

  <p>The princess didn't expect Luo Luo Zheng to turn and come at her. She was still standing on the back of the unicorn and galloped forward at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>As both of them sped, she could only see a figure flash before her eyes.</p>

  <p>Her next thought was to open the Solitary Star Umbrella, which could protect her. Unfortunately, she didn't think fast enough.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Luo Luo Zheng grabbed the Princess Royal.</p>

  <p>Because of the great force binding her, even with her cultivation at the peak of the Spirit Transformation Realm, she could not break free from his grasp.</p>

  <p>The princess was at a complete loss of what to do.</p>

  <p>"Crap!"</p>

  <p>Kennan's and Woodrow's expressions suddenly shifted.</p>

  <p>This young man was actually grasping the Princess Royal as he rushed towards the Formless Sky Python.</p>

  <p>So the moment Luo Luo Zheng made his move, he had thought out every possible outcome.</p>

  <p>First of all, he could not kill the princess on the unicorn. Regardless how difficult it was to kill a warrior at the peak of the Spirit Transformation Realm, even if he could kill her, the two world lords would never let him go if the princess died at his hands.</p>

  <p>There was no way he could escape the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, so killing the princess would be a death sentence.</p>

  <p>Little did everyone know, his two strikes were done only to test their reactions.</p>

  <p>The results were just as Luo Luo Zheng had assumed. When he struck out his second sword strike to threaten the princess, they already decided to take him out. One of the world lords was prepared to make a move against him.</p>

  <p>At that point, the smart move was to keep the princess hostage.</p>
