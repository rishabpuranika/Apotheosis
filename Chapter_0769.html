<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 769 Danger (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From the moment he successfully made it through the Life and Death Realm, every sect in the Central Region, regardless of size, were all dying to suck up to him or act so respectful. Even the fifth-grade sect itself, the Ethereal Spirit Sect which he hadn't been on good terms with couldn't ever dare to displease him.</p>

  <p>The kid acting a bit high and mighty in front of him was truly so peculiar!</p>

  <p>In reality, the only thing he did was throw a single punch. There was no way a minor hiccup like that could make Eddie give up that easily. He had gone through the lengths of coming all the way to the Cloud Hall completely dead set on annihilating every single one of its members, and he wouldn't just call it a day because of a stupid sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>For his second attempt, Eddie unsheathed the Nameless Saber from the scabbard he had tied to his waist.</p>

  <p>Eden had not come up to scratch in bringing out the full potential of the Nameless Saber. And the main cause of that was that he had been beaten by Luo Luo Zheng. From that event, Eddie had learned something. A man had to carve out his own path to the success of martial arts through his own power. Even if his son had been blessed with the divine-level talent, he would still have to get nourished and improved with his own two hands. The strength acquired by means of getting help from other people couldn't, in any way, be considered as the real strength.</p>

  <p>In his hands, Eddie had a tight grip on the Nameless Saber. The air around him had shifted. Before that, Eddie had given off the Mu Ning that made people think he was truly as massive as a mountain. But the moment he pulled out the Nameless Saber, his appearance became sharp and he flared with such radiance, making it look as though he had become one with the saber.</p>

  <p>When they sensed the Mu Ning Eddie was exuding, every single one of the Virtual Tribulation Realm elders felt ill at ease.</p>

  <p>The sect-protecting array might have fortunately been able to block Eddie's attack just now, but a high-ranking master such as Eddie would, without a doubt, have lots of other trump cards hiding up his sleeve. At that point, there was really no telling what could happen next.</p>

  <p>On that account, in spite of the fact that they were still quite confident in this enchanted barrier, they couldn't shake off the feeling of being anxious.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still up on his feet and didn't even move an inch. Two feet beneath the enchanted barrier, there he stood, saying under his breath, "Are you ready? Let's get this started!"</p>

  <p>Eddie moved back a little bit, lifting the Nameless Saber to his chest. Pieces of brownish-yellow life vitality in his arm transformed into streaks, seeping into the Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>"Condense!" Eddie yelled out.</p>

  <p>A brownish-yellow blade shadow started to materialize all around the Nameless Saber. An immense blade shadow that could be about three hundred feet long and forty feet wide, or possibly even fifty, suddenly emerged through the Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>A blade shadow of that magnitude would be capable of splitting a small mountain in half, and that could be done without having the need to activate the blade intent. And if the blade intent were to be activated, it could then swiftly raze the mountain to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Realm warriors possessed the divine strength capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas.</p>

  <p>"Furious slash on the void!"</p>

  <p>Just a few moments later, Eddie unleashed another attack again using the Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>The three hundred feet long blade shadow appeared as though it could tear the sky apart. In all of the Central Region, there was nothing that could possibly hope to stop that attack.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As he thrust his Nameless Saber horizontally into the enchanted barrier, it embedded an extensive and narrow trail on the exterior of the Light of Water, and at the end of that trail, there was Luo Luo Zheng, intently awaiting his attacks.</p>

  <p>Through all of that, the enchanted barrier remained unscathed and was still intact.</p>

  <p>It was indeed true that the strike caused the entire barrier to tremble, and the waves on the surface were actually more than a hundred feet in height.</p>

  <p>Regrettably so, Eddie, even after putting all of his strength into that slash, was still not able to surpass the capacity of what the barrier could take.</p>

  <p>After releasing a strike of that level, even someone as mighty as Eddie couldn't help himself from catching his breath. His face slowly went darker and darker. Even after giving it all he had got, he still couldn't even scratch Luo Luo Zheng! This was a bit of truth that Eddie wouldn't be able to accept.</p>

  <p>While Eddie was backed into a corner trying to find another way to shatter the enchanted barrier, he felt a sudden twinge of danger about to engulf him.</p>

  <p>Besides having a mastery of a few powerful cultivation methods, Eddie also held a remarkable talent. It was this ability of his which allowed him to get away from danger and escape the jaws of death. It was his ability to feel the killing intent emitted by other people, and through that, he could also sense the imminent danger!</p>

  <p>Taking all of that into consideration, upon stepping foot into the Life and Death Realm, Eddie had not been given many chances to make use of his innate talent. And the true reason for that was, it was quite hard to meet someone in the Central region who could pose a threat to his life.</p>

  <p>But in that brief second, he surprisingly felt an ominous sense of danger.</p>

  <p>Subconsciously, he rushed to get away from his current location, and only then was he able to notice a cloud of mist with mystifying colors coming toward him.</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, Eddie was able to move quickly, and he had gotten out before the cloud of smoke surrounded him completely.</p>

  <p>In an instant, a bolt of lightning with the size of a dragon appeared and was about to strike him.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As a result, the dragon-like lightning bolt only brushed against Eddie's side.</p>

  <p>It failed to hit the intended target.</p>

  <p>Having said that, Eddie was able to sense the power contained within that attack. Had he been struck by it, even though he might not have died, he would certainly end up in a critical condition! In addition to that puzzling mist, a terrible idea abruptly came to Eddie--the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array was completely capable of obliterating him.</p>

  <p>This was something Eddie found quite so hard to accept. But at that moment, if it weren't for his swift movement and his ability to sense danger, it was for certain that he would have ended up in such a problematic situation!</p>
