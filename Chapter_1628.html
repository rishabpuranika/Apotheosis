<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before Hailey could answer, she felt a hand touched her left shoulder.</p>

  <p>When she turned to look, she saw the expressionless Zheng staring at Malachi. Then, Zheng looked at her and motioned her to move back before he stepped forward to confront the disrespectful man. He answered Malachi's question, "Yes. Do you have a problem with that?"</p>

  <p>"I see. So, this… what does this mean? Are you all going to help her?"</p>

  <p>Malachi's eyes widened, and he didn't try to hide the contempt on his face as if taunting Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Not all. Just me," Zheng said coldly. "And it's not because of her. I just personally don't like you. You're too talkative and annoying. I figured I need to shut you up."</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression didn't change. He looked and sounded calm, but one could feel his arrogance through his words. He wasn't naturally arrogant, but he would never let anyone speak to his comrade that way. He thought of giving this person a taste of his bitter pill.</p>

  <p>Malachi was left dumbfounded by Zheng's words. He had never met anyone who would speak up to him like that. Moreover, he didn't expect that any of Hailey's companions would have the courage to do that after what they had seen. Either Zheng was stupid or showy for doing so.</p>

  <p>"Shut me up? Do you hear yourself? You're a funny guy!" Malachi said and then burst into wild laughter.</p>

  <p>The warriors in Malachi's group also found it funny. They laughed like maniacs who escaped the asylum. Malachi's group was a mix of different races— the human race, Demon Night race, and the Night Group. Like Zheng's group, they had also formed a temporary team with Malachi in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>It was a quite common practice, and the team with the best warriors would usually outdo others. The main city was the exit to the Hall of Causality where fiercest battles between warriors were expected to happen, and where the transferring of large number of Illusion Points would normally follow.</p>

  <p>A warrior who got killed would lose his Illusion Points and they would be transferred to the warriors who killed them. In other cities, there were usually only one or two who had already obtained several million Illusion Points. Hence, the warriors would normally only obtain Illusion Points ranging from hundreds to several hundreds of thousands.</p>

  <p>But in this main city, warriors could easily obtain tens of millions of Illusion Points just by defeating one opponent.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the warriors with a large number of Illusion Points would tend to be vigilant as they passed through the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Some warriors would stay with their companions who had fought side by side with them, while some would choose to hide within the city refusing to leave in the fear of losing their Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>In the Hall of Causality, the warriors had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with one another by cooperating to complete a task. After this, some warriors would agree to stay together as a group in preparation for the main city.</p>

  <p>Currently, there were already three teams that had almost dominated the entire main city. They were composed of the best warriors that had entered the city and other warriors had no chance against them.</p>

  <p>These teams would stay near the Hall of Causality to wait for their favorite target— those who just passed through the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The warriors who could pass through the Hall of Causality were quite strong, and the number of Illusion Points they obtained far exceeded those of ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>Malachi's team was one of these three teams.</p>

  <p>They had guarded the west gate of the main city and had plundered countless Illusion Points from other warriors. They were invincible that even an ace talent had been defeated by them.</p>

  <p>As Malachi's group continued to mock Zheng's words with their laughter, Coleman could not help himself and laughed with them.</p>

  <p>Ogres naturally had loud voices especially when they laughed helplessly.</p>

  <p>His laughter was so loud that it instantly overwhelmed Malachi's and his companions'.</p>

  <p>When Malachi heard this, he abruptly stopped laughing and furrowed his eyebrows in dismay. He stared at Coleman and asked, "What's funny, ogre?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Your laugh is just contagious, that's all," Coleman said, trying hard to stop himself from laughing but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw the look on Malachi's face and a faint smile appeared on his face. Somehow, he enjoyed seeing Malachi being caught off guard by Coleman's sudden laugh.</p>

  <p>Malachi sneered as he turned to Hailey and ordered, "I wouldn't want your friends to see me kill you. So, meet me outside the city. I'll give you a decent death and I'll get all the Illusion Points that you have obtained."</p>

  <p>After that, he turned back to Zheng and asked, "Do you think you have what it takes to fight me? If you want to see Death, dare to go outside the city so I can kill you. Don't worry, I will take my time on you."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's an ace talent in this group," one of his companions snorted.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! That's right! They will not stand a chance. These are a bunch of weak and coward warriors!"</p>

  <p>"Malachi! Don't set your expectations too high. I bet they won't even step outside the city. They will spend every waking day in hiding. I know cowards when I see one."</p>

  <p>Malachi's group laughed once more as they gave their share of mockery towards Zheng's group.</p>

  <p>Janet and Jeffrey had enough of the other group's boasting and shallow mockery. Cold killing intent started to show in their eyes. Jeffrey took a step forward and was about to say when Hailey stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother yourselves, please. I can deal with him by myself, and you should leave me alone. Malachi is an ace talent from our race. His strength is unfathomable, and he's the son of Supreme Lord Gunter,"</p>

  <p>Hailey said in a low voice. She pursed her lips and forced a smile to console them. Although she wasn't open to them, she considered them as her friends and didn't want to involve them in her troubles.</p>
