<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil Tiger race had always cast rather covetous eyes upon the Wooden Leaf race.</p>

  <p>While the Wooden Leaf race was weak, they were still capable of protecting themselves.</p>

  <p>Relying on the power of the thorny Treacherous Beings, in particular, they hid at the mountainside which was easy to hold but difficult to attack.</p>

  <p>But because the Wooden Leaf race wasn't of much value, the Evil Tiger race was in no hurry to attack them.</p>

  <p>Graham and Decker had already sensed an oncoming crisis. There were so many races on the Night View Island. Many weak races had been eliminated.</p>

  <p>Such was why Decker took the risk of following Luo Zheng, wanting to grow stronger.</p>

  <p>Over the past few days, the situation on the Night View Island had undergone a drastic change.</p>

  <p>The Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race were both destined to be exterminated? the races that followed them had fallen into chaos.</p>

  <p>But the drastic change was undoubtedly likely to bring great benefits to some races.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the chaos, the Evil Tiger race attacked the Wooden Leaf race.</p>

  <p>In the lead, Graham brought many of the soldiers up to the top to hide.</p>

  <p>Now, they were desperate.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that the Evil Tiger race couldn't defeat them.</p>

  <p>But the Wooden Leaf race had been well-prepared to fight to the death. If the Evil Tiger race forced their way up, they would definitely suffer heavy casualties.</p>

  <p>But since the Evil Tiger race had already made a move, they weren't about to give up so easily.</p>

  <p>"Master Graham, can we try to parley with them?" asked one of the Wooden Leaf race's soldiers.</p>

  <p>Graham's smile was bitter. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>The Evil Tiger race did not communicate with the Wooden Leaf race.</p>

  <p>They had slaughtered more than ten members of the Wooden Leaf race as soon as they came.</p>

  <p>And they were completely determined to exterminate the Wooden Leaf race.</p>

  <p>Slowly, the Evil Tiger race's warriors approached the mountainside.</p>

  <p>At this point, they were ready to rush forward at any moment.</p>

  <p>The air was heavy.</p>

  <p>No one even wanted to blink.</p>

  <p>"If you attack us, you'll lose over half of your men. By then, the Ghost Face race in the adjacent mountain will not let you go!" Graham suddenly shouted out.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Face race was a hard nut to crack.</p>

  <p>If the Evil Tiger race suffered several casualties, the Ghost Face race would undoubtedly take the opportunity to attack.</p>

  <p>But the Evil Tiger race's leader chuckled. "You don't need to worry about that. The Ghost Face race has already moved out!"</p>

  <p>The said race used to be a major hindrance to the Evil Tiger race. With them gone, the Evil Tiger race had nothing to worry about.</p>

  <p>As they talked, the warriors of the Evil Tiger race took a few more steps forward, now only a hundred feet away from the nearest members of the Wooden Leaf race.</p>

  <p>Graham gritted his teeth, his heart filling with hesitation. While he wanted his soldiers to attack, he knew it would mean his people's doomsday.</p>

  <p>"Look!" A member of the Wooden Leaf race pointed into the distance.</p>

  <p>"Decker is back!"</p>

  <p>"It's Decker!"</p>

  <p>"He's back from the Ghost Mountain!"</p>

  <p>Many of them began exclaiming, their voices full of hope.</p>

  <p>Looking into the distance, Graham smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>'So what if Decker came back?' he thought.</p>

  <p>With Decker's strength, what achievement could he have possibly made in the Ghost Mountain?</p>

  <p>At the very best, he could have probably fused with a hostility-level Treacherous Being, but that would do nothing to help the situation.</p>

  <p>The Evil Tiger race had also taken notice of Decker's arrival in the distance.</p>

  <p>Their leader looked back and sneered. Picking out three warriors from the group, he ordered, "Deal with him!"</p>

  <p>The three warriors then summoned the Wind Ghosts. These ghosts floated down the mountain rapidly.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, Decker was merely a fish on a chopping block.</p>

  <p>But just as they approached, Decker pulled out his glazed sheet and asked,</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to help me?"</p>

  <p>In the past few days, he had gotten on harmoniously with Cary.</p>

  <p>As a friendly-type Treacherous Being, Cary was as simple as a child, regarding Decker as his friend.</p>

  <p>While he was unwilling to leave the glazed sheet, Cary wouldn't hesitate to take action when his friend was in need, especially since the opponents seemed far too weak to give him any trouble.</p>

  <p>"Sure," Cary merely said.</p>

  <p>After getting his reply, Decker was expressionless as he gave the order,</p>

  <p>"Kill them all."</p>

  <p>When the warriors of the Evil Tiger race approached Decker, their eyes narrowed ferociously? they had been so close, but Decker was adamantly resisting.</p>

  <p>Just as the thought flashed through their minds, three sharp spines suddenly extended from the glazed sheet.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>They pierced accurately through the warriors of the Evil Tiger race.</p>

  <p>Along with them, they pierced through the Wind Ghosts attached to their bodies as well.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Cary drilled out of the glazed sheet, retracting the three spines back to his back.</p>

  <p>Now, the three warriors of the Evil Tiger race were attached to his back.</p>

  <p>The moment had the entire Wooden Leaf race and Evil Tiger race completely stunned.</p>

  <p>Cary's aura was undoubtedly gentle.</p>

  <p>But they could tell that he wasn't at the hostility level nor the resentment level.</p>

  <p>The terrifying fact was that he was at the hatred level.</p>

  <p>A chill ran down the spine of the Evil Tiger race's leader.</p>

  <p>To think that Decker had brought back a hatred-level Treacherous Being with him.</p>

  <p>Such was something only the Great Ghost Priests were known to be able to do, and even then, it was highly difficult for them to leave the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>It was completely unheard of.</p>

  <p>While he couldn't believe what he saw, he knew he had to take it as it was.</p>

  <p>Just then, Cary started rushing toward the Evil Tiger race.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>"This is a hatred-level Treacherous Being!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>No trace of arrogance was left on the faces of the Evil Tiger race's warriors.</p>

  <p>Instead, they all ran away without hesitation.</p>

  <p>While Cary looked like he was moving slowly, he was actually going at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>He shifted into a huge ball, shooting fast and piercing through the members of the Evil Tiger race, hanging their corpses on his back like they were nothing.</p>

  <p>In mere seconds, all the members of the Evil Tiger race were completely slaughtered.</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence before the members of the Wooden Leaf race let out a loud cheer.</p>

  <p>Graham's eyes were still wide in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The human race no longer returned to the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>At their request, a grotto was created in the south of the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>There, the thirteen wolf teeth were neatly placed.</p>

  <p>To prevent the Monkey Masters from spying on them, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the rest had set up several enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>"The ancestry-level bloodline hates being separated from my body."</p>

  <p>"If you get it out of your body without its permission, you will suffer, indeed."</p>

  <p>They had tried several methods to use the ancestry-level bloodline's power, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it has intelligence," said the real Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"I tried communicating with it before I entered the Night View Island, but I also failed," Luo Zheng said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But judging from what it did before, it must have a specific purpose," remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded and said, "It only takes the initiative to make a move if it thinks the situation is in its favor. Otherwise, it will only protect Luo Zheng passively."</p>

  <p>"Since we can't communicate with or persuade it, it's almost impossible to ask its help," said Emperor Di Jun pessimistically.</p>

  <p>The entire grotto fell silent.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had been confident.</p>

  <p>But after several attempts, there was no breakthrough whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was left at a loss, Luo Zheng suddenly stood up and walked up to a wolf tooth.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>And then, he cut into his arm.</p>

  <p>Through the wound, the ancestry-level bloodline could be observed.</p>

  <p>But the ancestry-level bloodline was rather thick. When it shrank within the wound, not even a single drop of blood fell.</p>
