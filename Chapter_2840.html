<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2840 A Secret Cellar </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>During this time, Hallet and Harold were all over the place.</p>

  <p>They knew why Nicholas was planning a conquest of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>If Nicholas took control of the Abyss Demon Region, he might take some drastic actions when he returned to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Hallet, Harold, and the other forces, saw this.</p>

  <p>That was how Hallet convinced the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan decided to side with the Sword Clan. If the Sword Clan were to fight against the alliance of the powerful clans, the Moon Clan would join them.</p>

  <p>Harold, on the other hand, was trying to find the Godly Geniuses who were scattered in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine land was so large, it wouldn't be easy to trace the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Even with the help of the Evolutionary Fifty to predict their whereabouts, the range was too large. But that didn't mean there was no trace.</p>

  <p>After all, the Godly Geniuses would break a rule of the slate if they tried to enter the divine land. And thanks to this, Harold would get an approximate time and area range of their coming.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses in the universe were secondary creatures, but in terms of talent, they were comparable to the talents of the divine land. They were all impressive, which was why he wouldn't need a lot of time to find them.</p>

  <p>All preparations were carried out in an orderly way but they hadn't expected Nicholas to die so suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Since Nicholas is now dead, does it mean that the alliance of the powerful clans has lost the battle in the Abyss Demon Region?" Hallet asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, then it's good news," Augustus said, giggling.</p>

  <p>But Harold still looked conflicted. "I don't think Nicholas is who we need to worry about," he said.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan that Nicholas represented was no doubt powerful. But it was probably not invincible by a large margin.</p>

  <p>The strength of several old geezers belonging to the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan couldn't be underestimated. These two great forces hadn't made a move for so many years and hadn't stepped out to fight against the alliance of the powerful clans. They were afraid of Nicholas, but also of the Yellow Emperor Guards standing behind him.</p>

  <p>"What should we do next?" asked Hallet.</p>

  <p>Harold thought about it for a while before replying, "Let's wait and see."</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded, but it was obvious that they were worried about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a long way to the Evil Ghost Region, but with Luo Zheng's immense speed, he should have already returned. But they weren't able to find him now.</p>

  <p>The Evil Ghost Region was near the Abyss Demon Region, but the latter's entrance was not in the Evil Ghost Region, so there was only a small chance that Luo Zheng was involved in whatever was going on there. However, they were still a little worried.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region...</p>

  <p>Samuel emerged from the coffin with a flash and turned to glare ferociously at it.</p>

  <p>He had failed to get the True Demon Body. It would probably be a good idea to get the precious body refined by Nicholas at the last moment.</p>

  <p>But that damned woman had unfortunately stopped him!</p>

  <p>He waved the Spear of Supreme Harmony, causing a strong, spatial wave to shoot out of the tip of the spear at the coffin.</p>

  <p>Samuel hadn't expected this strike to destroy the coffin.</p>

  <p>After all, the coffin had been here for many years. He had attacked it just to vent his anger.</p>

  <p>As far as he was concerned, the coffin was an illusion floating at the space entrance.</p>

  <p>His spear should have penetrated the coffin but failed to hurt it.</p>

  <p>But something unexpected happened in that moment.</p>

  <p>His spear hit the coffin with a muffled thunk.</p>

  <p>The sound shocked Samuel to the bone.</p>

  <p>From what he had experienced, Samuel understood that the Holy Beings weren't as strong as they made it out to be and would be in danger of losing their lives if they lowered their guard here.</p>

  <p>But now, the Spear of Supreme Harmony managed to push the coffin aside.</p>

  <p>There was a dark entrance to a cellar beneath the coffin.</p>

  <p>A row of orderly stairs extended downwards until they were engulfed in darkness. Samuel had no idea where they were heading to.</p>

  <p>Samuel's heart skipped a beat as he realized that he had discovered a great secret.</p>

  <p>"This coffin is floating in the air. Anyone who standing near it will be sucked into it. They cannot push it away. And although that woman is here all this time, it is impossible for her to push it away because the Space Law is prohibited in the Abyss Demon Region. But what's hidden under the coffin?"</p>

  <p>Samuel was a cautious person, which was why he stood at the entrance, hesitating.</p>

  <p>His eyes suddenly twinkled with a blue light that penetrated the darkness of the cellar. He seemed to see something in there that interested him greatly enough to make his mind up to enter the cellar.</p>

  <p>Standing on the steps of the cellar, he stabbed the spear at the bottom of the coffin and pulled it back into place.</p>

  <p>If the woman left the coffin and discovered this cellar, she would probably follow him. She was not weaker than him, and Luo Zheng and Tianming were difficult to deal with. But this way, he had a certain sense of relief.</p>

  <p>Thinking thus, he walked towards the deep end of the cellar.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng and the others were in the world covered with snow and ice in the coffin, they might be able to feel the shock of the entire coffin.</p>

  <p>As Samuel had moved the coffin, the snow on the mountains crumbled and collapsed.</p>

  <p>But since they were in the space beneath the ice volcano, they did not sense the changes outside.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still talking to his mother about what had happened at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>He mentioned the grudges among the Wild Gods, the Yellow Emperor race, the Snake Goddess race, and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes widened at this, including Lorena and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had felt that his trip to the divine land had been strange, but compared to Luo Zheng's, it was just a drop in the bucket.</p>

  <p>"So basically, the masters at the Other Shore Realm of the Snake Goddess race and our Nine Li race are outside the divine land, right?" Lorena asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and said, "But the space barrier is blocking them from coming in."</p>

  <p id="top_1">"Timotheus, a five-star Nine Li Guard," Lorena muttered. "I have never heard of this man!"</p>

  <p>Rosie smiled and said, "We were young when we left the Source World.</p>

  <p>Our Nine Li race is full of talented people. The five-star Nine Li Guards are powerful, but we have gotten many of them in our race in the past.</p>

  <p>Timotheus must have left our race a long time ago, which is probably why you haven't heard of him."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He knew that except for Leopold, no one else had heard of Lorena. His mother hadn't been born at the time.</p>

  <p>"A five-star Nine Li Guard should be able to deal with Leyton," said Lorena.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race's mortal enemy was not Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had only released Hamish from his seal in order to fulfill his own ambitions.</p>

  <p>The true enemy of the Nine Li race was the Yellow Emperor Guard Leyton who had performed the Blood Splitting Technique that had killed all the Nine Li people.</p>
