<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1822 Determined (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although no one could figure out the origin of her flame, it was still an abnormal flame that petrified even her own father.</p>

  <p>'How did this man manage to do it?' she wondered in awe.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't have the slightest idea about the thoughts that were running through this woman's mind. He firmly grasped her and madly rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a loud thud came from behind them, similar to that of thunder!</p>

  <p>In such a short period of running, Luo Luo Zheng had already brought this woman over a hundred miles with him. However, the violent sound coming from behind was deafening. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't ignore it.</p>

  <p>It was like something was exploding right near their ears.</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Python began to move again!</p>

  <p>The two world lords had failed to stop it.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Formless Sky Python wasn't something that the world lords could defeat easily. Even though they had used the Wishing Spell to seal the Formless Sky Python off, the Formless Sky Python still managed to break free. However, it could still be considered a feat for these world lords to have controlled the Formless Sky Python for so long!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's expression changed when he realized what was happening. His eyes caught the sight of the huge shadow in the distance when it suddenly began to prostrate on the ground. The second it touched the ground, the whole place began to tremble under its power. The Formless Sky Python seemed to be coming at them.</p>

  <p>The target of this Formless Sky Python was neither Luo Luo Zheng nor the two world lords. It was after the woman that Luo Luo Zheng was holding.</p>

  <p>At first, the princess hadn't realized this. But as soon as the revelation began to sink in, her face paled.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," Luo Luo Zheng said as he tried to release this woman. Now he didn't want her anywhere near him.</p>

  <p>Once he understood this woman was the source of all the trouble, he had no intention of saving her. After all, this had nothing to do with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Normally, when someone was in danger, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't sit and watch. He was by no means a cold-blooded person. However, he had his own reasons for not trying to save this lady. Firstly, she was trying to capture him, so strictly speaking, she was not a friend but an enemy. Secondly, Luo Luo Zheng had just entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land hence he didn't have the ability to fight the Formless Sky Python. With all the responsibilities he was carrying on his shoulder, he had no intention of taking another burden. 'I can't just die here, ' he thought with finality.</p>

  <p>"You!" After the princess was released, she glared at the golden figure of Luo Luo Zheng, full of rage.</p>

  <p>She had completely forgotten about her previous rude actions towards Luo Luo Zheng. Now she could think of nothing but his cowardliness. 'What a ruthless man! He is keeping me here to die!' she thought spitefully.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, didn't give a damn about what she thought. With determination, he dashed forward, holding onto his dear life. The princess clenched her teeth and decided to follow him.</p>

  <p>"Just a second ago, I was afraid I would burn you to death. But it turns out you deserve to be burned to death!" the Princess Royal angrily spat as she almost caught up with him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of your flame, so there is no way you can burn me to death. Why did you say I deserve to die! Don't follow me!" Luo Luo Zheng impatiently warned.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't stop following you!"</p>

  <p>The princess braced herself and dashed forward. Kennan and Woodrow were unable to stop the Formless Sky Python and she didn't know what her next move should be. This young man was a complete stranger.</p>

  <p>However, the information given by the legend of the Celestial Soul member and the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had devoured her flame made her want to place her hopes on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She liked to believe that extraordinary people had extraordinary methods. This was something her father had taught her. Even though the person in front of her was only at the Spirit Supreme Realm, there was something about him that told her that he was capable of defeating anyone.</p>

  <p>She was so lost in her thoughts that her eyes weren't actually looking at Luo Luo Zheng. Swiftly, he turned around, pulled his sword and struck out with it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword was extremely sharp. All the trees ten miles around were cut down in a swift motion. The sword radiance arced through the air, heading straight for the princess!</p>

  <p>If the princess wanted to dodge, she could have done it by lowering her head or lifting her body. In truth, Luo Luo Zheng had intentionally controlled the speed of his strike so that she had enough time to dodge.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't seem to have any intention of dodging. She still maintained her height in the sky as she followed behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as the sword radiance reached the princess' ear and was about to chop her head off, screams rang out from several thousand feet behind her.</p>

  <p>The warriors that followed the princess were greatly shocked. When these Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists saw that the Formless Sky Python had broken free from the control of the two world lords, all they could think of was to run for their lives. However, they might not end well if they left the princess behind. And it would be even worse by being eaten by the Formless Sky Python. In such a dire situation, they had no choice but to follow Luo Luo Zheng and the princess.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng's sword radiance finally stopped right beside the princess' ear.</p>

  <p>A part of the hair above her left ear was chopped off. And a small cut was left by the sword radiance on her tiny ear where blood droplets began to ooze out.</p>

  <p>But the princess' face looked as determined as ever, and she showed no signs of giving up.</p>

  <p>    </p>
