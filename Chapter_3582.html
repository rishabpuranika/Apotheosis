<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3582 Secret Contact </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng could take control, he didn't interfere too much in the Evil God's cultivation.</p>

  <p>After he heard what Chaim had said before, he felt an alarming sense of urgency. He also needed to improve himself immediately.</p>

  <p>The rising wind foreboded the coming storm, or so they said. It seemed that the peacefulness in the Source World wouldn't last long.</p>

  <p>In Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, a Soul of Light continued to condense until it quickly turned into a human figure.</p>

  <p>This human figure emitted a sinister and evil aura. It was the Evil God, the notorious Soul Devouring Demon in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Not far from the Evil God were several Souls of Light who came from different races and had different forms.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, all the powerful and qualified creatures in Stage Thirteen had been to the Chaotic Source World. They had all left the Lust World and reached the Desire World, and only a few relatively weak Souls of Light who didn't get the tickets were left behind.</p>

  <p>They gestured to each other when they sensed the Evil God's powerful Soul of Light. Then, one of them walked towards the Evil God and said, "Human friend, we just got the key to a temple. Would you like to explore it with us?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God coldly glanced at them. He had only disappeared for a few months, but these creatures in the Lust World seemed to have forgotten him.</p>

  <p>"Leave me alone," he hissed.</p>

  <p>It took him a lot of effort to come to the Other Shore, and he had something more important to do.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for his current situation, he would've swallowed them all up alive.</p>

  <p>However, the creatures did not leave. One of them, who appeared to be their leader, suddenly brought out a handful of Soul Restraining Sand and scattered it on his body.</p>

  <p>The green sand enveloped his body and soon enough, he couldn't escape from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Let's attack him together! He's got a strong Soul of Light! We'll gain a lot from this!" the creature cried out.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, a rope went straight towards the Evil God and firmly bound his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Yet, the Evil God seemed unbothered. He simply asked in an icy voice,</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>The leader of the creatures was overjoyed to see that they had caught the Evil God quite easily.</p>

  <p>"You have such a powerful Soul of Light. We can refine a lot of soul crystal with it!" he exclaimed. "Refine soul crystal?" said the Evil God, as his eyes narrowed into slits.</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, the soul crystal couldn't be refined because it was difficult to erase the memories of the Souls of Light. Only after numerous years of purification could pure soul crystal be formed.</p>

  <p>Thus, he wondered why these creatures claimed that they were able to refine soul crystal.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you don't have to think too much." The creature chuckled and said,</p>

  <p>"Let's take him back together!"</p>

  <p>At their leader's command, the other creatures rushed forward and hoisted the Evil God above their heads.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to set out, they suddenly felt a sharp stab of pain in their arms, which felt like they were splashed with sulfuric acid. In the next second, their arms were burnt off.</p>

  <p>The pain was too unbearable for them that they wanted to drop the Evil God, but their hands and feet had already melted into his body, which made it impossible for them to let go of him.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Eventually, the Evil God quickly devoured the creatures' heads, bodies, legs, and feet?</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, the Evil God had consumed all the creatures that carried him.</p>

  <p>Only the outermost creature had half of his body left, but he clearly wouldn't be able to pull himself out of the Evil God's Soul of Light. "You, you are the legendary Soul Devouring Demon..." he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right," the Evil God answered. He lightly shook his body, and the rope that bound him broke inch by inch. After that, he grabbed half of the creature's body and absorbed it in a split second.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, Luo Zheng controlled the Evil God's every move. The Evil God had no other choice but to obey.</p>

  <p>However, it was different on the Other Shore. As long as Luo Zheng didn't bring the Evil God back into his inner world, he wouldn't be able to find the Evil God's memories of the Other Shore in his mind.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore was the Evil God's only chance.</p>

  <p>As soon as he found his direction, he wasted no time and ran away.</p>

  <p>There were many strongholds of great races, both large and small, that were densely packed in the west area of Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God arrived at his destination, he concealed his aura and shuttled through those strongholds.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he found a low building.</p>

  <p>At the building's entrance were two human-shaped creatures.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" one of the human-shaped creatures snapped when he saw the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"The ship sails without limits," replied the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The two human-shaped creatures recognized the code, and their hearts pounded in their chests. Then, they quickly made way for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>There were several creatures that guarded the low building.</p>

  <p>They were the most powerful creatures of the Black Mountain Guild. They would even be considered as talented disciples if they were in a super force.</p>

  <p>Of course, they still weren't qualified to join the Black Ship. After all, the members of the Black Ship were so-called one-in-a-million talents.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Evil God!"</p>

  <p>"I heard that your creator had caught you in the Chaotic Source World!"</p>

  <p>"Even the invincible Evil God has to surrender. Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Some of them sneered at him when he arrived.</p>

  <p>They had all suffered losses because of the Evil God in the Black Mountain Guild, and two of them had even almost died in his hands. However, their hearts held no real resentment, as they were used to the infamous cruelty of the Black Mountain Guild.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap. Can you get in touch with the Black Ship?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>One of the burly creatures shook his head as he said, "The Black Ship came frequently when you were in the Black Mountain Guild. Since you went to the Chaotic Source World last time, the Black Ship has never appeared."</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that these creatures were very jealous of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"I remember that there is a contact array in the Black Mountain Guild.</p>

  <p>When you are in danger, you can call for the Black Ship to descend," the Evil God said.</p>

  <p>"As you said, we won't use the array unless we are in danger," the burly creature answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm in danger now," the Evil God said in a deep voice.</p>

  <p>"You are not one of us." The burly creature's laugh filled the space.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stood still for a few seconds. He knew that it was unrealistic for him to expect these creatures to help him, but it would be great if they didn't add insult to injury.</p>

  <p>He thought for a while, and then he proposed, "Whoever helps me contact the Black Ship will be awarded with ten finger-size chunks of soul crystal!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God himself didn't need soul crystal. He only needed to continuously devour the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Souls of Light in front of him were very hungry for soul crystal.</p>

  <p>The moment the Evil God offered his price, some of the creatures lit up in excitement. The burly creature realized that he couldn't pass up such a good chance, so he agreed first. "Ten finger-size chunks of soul crystal, and I'll help you contact the Black Ship now!" he declared.</p>

  <p>"I don't need ten finger-size chunks. Nine is enough."</p>

  <p>"Give me six! I'll activate the contact array!"</p>

  <p>It turned out that there was no unity among the creatures of the Black Mountain Guild. Since it wasn't difficult to activate the contact array, the other creatures immediately chose to compete with the burly creature.</p>

  <p>The Evil God simply ignored them and turned to the burly creature. "You activate the contact array, and I'll go find the soul crystal," he said.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he went straight out of the stronghold.</p>

  <p>The corner of his lips curved up into a small smirk. It was definitely an easy task for him to plunder ten finger-size chunks of soul crystal.</p>
