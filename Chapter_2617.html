  <p>
</p>

  <p>In fact, Margaret and Yudie had both met Augustus before.</p>

  <p>At that time, Zheng had battled against the incarnation of Augustus while passing the True Path.</p>

  <p>However, Augustus' attentions had then been focused on Zheng, so he hadn't even given Margaret a thought.</p>

  <p>Augustus knew without a doubt that there were several important people locked up in the dungeon of the fairy palace, especially Wayne who had left a deep impression on Augustus before.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Augustus was able to instantly recognize him.</p>

  <p>They finally arrived at the land transitioning into the Swirl Forest, and a flash of pale golden light effused the big trees inside the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>It was this living, writhing golden light that repulsed all others from taking a step forward.</p>

  <p>Even though Wayne was a top-rank True God, he was also unable to enter into the forest.</p>

  <p>"What transpired just now?"</p>

  <p>Just before Augustus began to merge with the forest soul, the entire Swirl Forest emanated waves of anger.</p>

  <p>Wayne had never witnessed such a scene. He was stunned, and his big mouth gaped wipe open.</p>

  <p>Margaret couldn't comprehend what was happening.</p>

  <p>She was a bit familiar with the lore of the Swirl Forest. However, she still questioned, "Is there really no way to enter?"</p>

  <p>"No way! All of the forbidden areas have only one way in. Now, this entrance is shut to us, and it is impossible even for a consummate True God to enter it by force!" Wayne said firmly, "Unless you have the means to enter the Floating Island of a powerful clan and use the transmission array on the Floating Island!"</p>

  <p>"The Floating Island of a powerful clan? What's that? Can I join this powerful clan on the Floating Island?" Margaret wondered aloud, blinking her eyes.</p>

  <p>Wayne became somewhat impatient upon hearing Margaret's musings.</p>

  <p>This woman seemed to be ignorant about everything. Given the complexity of this situation, it might take him forever to explain this to her.</p>

  <p>It didn't even matter whether she was qualified to join a powerful clan or not. If she really wanted to do it, taking her out of the Cyan Demon Region and getting her to the Time Sea would be a great challenge to Wayne.</p>

  <p>He felt a sense of regret then. He hadn't expected his men to bring Zheng's woman back and give her to him. Already this had caused him a lot of grief.</p>

  <p>As Wayne became somewhat morose, there was a sudden change in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>An invisible force ebbed out of the fairy palace inside the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Crash, crash, crash...</p>

  <p>Instantly, the trees groaned and tumbled over to either side with a suddenly spray of leaves.</p>

  <p>A path had appeared through the undergrowth!</p>

  <p>The path extended tens of thousands of miles from the fairy palace to the very edge of the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>And a kind of tunnel had suddenly appeared within the layer of golden light that enveloped the edge of the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Margaret looked at the gap with a puzzled expression and then doubted,</p>

  <p>"Are you sure we can't enter the Swirl Forest?"</p>

  <p>Wayne was also staring in dumbfounded silence at this bizarre scene.</p>

  <p>As a top-rank True God, he was destined to run a third-tier clan.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he knew the laws governing the forbidden areas well.</p>

  <p>This scene was completely beyond his knowledge. He looked at the scene with eyes wide as saucers.</p>

  <p>After a long while, he said, "It seems that someone wants us to enter."</p>

  <p>"Is it my husband, Zheng, who has invited us in?" Margaret's eyes narrowed, and a challenging smirk had appeared on her face. "I wonder why he hasn't come to pick me up himself?"</p>

  <p>Wayne rolled his eyes and sneered, "Your husband is not capable of that!"</p>

  <p>Wayne had just succeeded in leaving the confines of the fairy palace. He believed that no matter how talented Zheng was, he lacked the might to progress to such a level of achievement.</p>

  <p>"Without any doubt, it is my husband!"</p>

  <p>Margaret wasn't at all perturbed by Wayne's words. She shrugged and advanced into the new pathway without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Wayne reluctantly followed her as he worried about Margaret's safety.</p>

  <p>The beasts in the Swirl Forest were extraordinarily ferocious, and there were some extremely powerful monsters that dwelt in the forest and that even he couldn't oppose.</p>

  <p>As the two of them trudged along the path, they didn't meet any ferocious beasts at all along the way!</p>

  <p>However, the tunnel stretching from here to the fairy palace was thousands of miles in length. Considering Margaret's slow pace, it would probably take a few months to reach their destination!</p>

  <p>After walking slowly along with Margaret for one hour, Wayne finally grew impatient, and grabbing Margaret, he flew along the path...</p>

  <p>Not long after, Margaret's eyes suddenly lit up as she happily chirped,</p>

  <p>"Look, the fairy palace is here!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Wayne knew this instantly. He had been a prisoner within this fairy palace for so many divine eras. So even if the fairy palace should turn into ash, he could recognize it still.</p>

  <p>But why was there suddenly such abundant vitality in the fairy palace?</p>

  <p>Wayne could smell a strong metallic tang of spilled blood before he had even drawn close to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>When they entered the fairy palace, they were all shocked by many wild beast corpses piled up on the ground.</p>

  <p>However, Saul had already begun clearing them up.</p>

  <p>Harold, having recovered his original manifestation, was waiting in the fairy palace along with Yan and the others.</p>

  <p>Once Xun saw Margaret, she folded her arms over her chest with a smile, saying, "It's indeed her."</p>

  <p>However, when Margaret saw these familiar faces she did not show any surprise at all. Although there were other strangers also standing in the fairy palace, she did not even notice their cultivation bases. She expressed her only concern, "Where is my husband? Why don't I see him here?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this question, Harold suddenly flashed a look tinged with bitterness in his eyes. He replied in a low voice, "Let Yan answer that..."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, everyone grew pensive and could not help but feel upset in their hearts.</p>

  <p>In Harold's and Hallet's eyes, Zheng was pre-eminent and irreplaceable.</p>

  <p>If others died, it would be a small matter. However, if Zheng died, they would face immense problems and have many things that could not be achieved in the future. That would really throw a spanner in the works.</p>

  <p>In the past, after sending Zheng into the depths of the ground, Harold had left. As he had sensed that the array flag arranged on the Tie Clan's territory had been destroyed, he immediately feared that something terrible had happened!</p>

  <p>The array flag was a precious treasure of the Luo Clan. Even a consummate True God could not obliterate it so easily.</p>

  <p>In other words, since Harold's departure, a Holy Being had dived to the ground!</p>

  <p>It was then that Harold began to have misgivings.</p>

  <p>Later, he had heard chatter among the powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Three Holy Beings had died, and one universe had collapsed. It was said that Nicholas had captured someone underground.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, there was no sign of him anywhere.</p>

  <p>This was an unacceptable result to Harold and those others in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>While they were still in the dark about what happened, they could only bear the news of this shocking result. All that they could do was to work harder and harder according to their original plan. There was no time to morn or lament as they shouldered the heavy burden.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everyone was in a bad mood recently. Margaret's unwitting question had stirred up everyone's regrets, and they felt the loss again as their hearts sank.</p>

  <p>"My brother is missing," Yan whispered sadly to Margaret, who she had never met.</p>

  <p>Margaret's eyebrows immediately furrowed in fear as her face became a pale Xun. "Missing? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Xun noticed Margaret's expression and sadly shook her head.</p>

  <p>Yudie blinked her eyes, fighting the tears that threatened there, and her long eyelashes fluttered.</p>

  <p>They knew Margaret all too well, and she might not restrain her emotions.</p>

  <p>Only Joy, who stood to the side, was watching Margaret with great interest.</p>

  <p>She had detected an astonishing quality in Margaret. This woman had successfully cultivated the Purple Aura Godly Way, and her Purple Power Body was most unique. Naturally, Joy was intrigued.</p>

  <p>Harold had revealed some of Mike's plan to Joy, including some insight about the Godly Geniuses who had great talents.</p>

  <p>Margaret must be one of the so-called Godly Geniuses, but what Joy hadn't expected was that Margaret was also Zheng's wife.</p>
