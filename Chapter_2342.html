<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2342 Inside And Outside The Star Door </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The True God rushed out in absolute panic, an extremely terrified expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Even a Soul-killing Ghost couldn't have caused such fear in a True God.</p>

  <p>What could he have possibly seen on the other side of the Star Door?</p>

  <p>"What's up? Something wrong?" Reginald asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Outside, outside..." the True God faltered, pointing at the Star Door.</p>

  <p>Paralyzed by extreme fear, he couldn't even find the words to speak clearly anymore.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Star Door began to glow and more True Gods rushed back in from the Star Door. The True Gods returning from the outside of the valley looked as though they had found something completely unimaginable outside the valley.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Reginald asked again, more seriously this time.</p>

  <p>"Out...out there, there's a monster!" another True God said in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>One after another, the True Gods came back from the Star Door. No more than thirty seconds later, half of the two hundred True Gods who had left earlier were all back, huddling in a group.</p>

  <p>"Ah�"</p>

  <p>This time, a burly top-rank True God rushed in from the Star Door and roared, "It's coming! Run! The monster is coming!"</p>

  <p>The burly top-rank True God was from the Xie Clan. His previous performance had also been quite impressive. He was a fearless man.</p>

  <p>Even when he encountered the Soul-killing Ghosts, he hadn't hesitated to kill many of them with his Thunder Halberd.</p>

  <p>Now though, it was almost as though he was someone else. He looked scared to death!</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, Zheng's eyes noticed a movement coming from the Star Door. He looked over just as a strange claw stretched out of it.</p>

  <p>It was a three-toed claw. Each of the toes had a black nail. Once the claw had stretched its way out through the Star Door, it gripped onto the Xie Clan's top-rank True God, as if clawing at an ant, before dragging him back toward the Star Door.</p>

  <p>"Cut the claw off!" someone hurled. Reginald's face darkened. Before the person could finish screaming, he had already made his move!</p>

  <p>Besides him, the other top-rank True Gods were equally taking action and making their moves.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed. The Buddha Emperor Sword in his hand was like an invisible fish and it condensed itself in the blink of an eye before charging toward the claw.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang...</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Hammers, swords, axes and many other kinds of terrifying weapons swung together at the claw.</p>

  <p>Every single True God present launched their attack and ruthlessly slashed at the giant claw.</p>

  <p>Without wavering in the slightest, Zheng's Buddha Emperor Sword hit the claw straight on!</p>

  <p>After this round of attacks, the giant claw that had stretched through the Star Door hadn't been harmed in the least. Unbelievable!</p>

  <p>"Help! No! Kill me! Please! Just kill me..."</p>

  <p>The Xie Clan's top-rank True God shouted in despair. His eyes were full of fear as he cried out in pain. He clawed at the soil and left several fingerprints on the ground. Clearly, to him, being dragged back into the Star Door was more terrifying than being killed right here, right now.</p>

  <p>Despite his begging, no True God present was willing to kill him.</p>

  <p>Instead, they only watched him disappear into the other side of the Star Door.</p>

  <p>"What the fuck just happened? What the hell is that?" Reginald asked loudly, his voice trembling somewhat.</p>

  <p>One of the True Gods who had returned from the outside of the valley quickly said, "Let's talk about it later! Pascal, quickly take the Star Door down. Do it now!"</p>

  <p>A look of hesitation etched itself on Pascal's face.</p>

  <p>The Star Door could only be activated once. Although he could indeed close the Star Door and put it away, the Star Door itself would be rendered completely useless and he wouldn't ever be capable of activating it again.</p>

  <p>Around them, the Golden Shell Turtles in the valley continued slowly crawling toward the True Gods. If he put away the Star Door now, wouldn't they lose their only escape? How would they leave this valley, then?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, that claw must have come from an extremely powerful monster. Even if they wanted to escape from the Star Door, they'd have no choice but to eventually face that thing...</p>

  <p>As Pascal stood motionless in hesitation, the center of the azure Star Door began rippling with luminosity, like a lake.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, everyone! Something is about to appear again!"</p>

  <p>All the True Gods scattered in every direction, trying their best to distance themselves from the Star Door. From their new position, they stared at the Star Door through squinting, fearful eyes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It was a True God that suddenly rushed in from the Star Door!</p>

  <p>The True God, dressed in a blood red robe, dashed so fast that no one could see the person's face clearly, not even Zheng, Reginald, or Soren. The True God had run in sideways, and with great momentum. In order to slow down and decrease her impact, she flipped into a somersault in midair, and both the weapons in her hands plowed two ditches on the ground as she landed.</p>

  <p>Finally, she stopped at the edge of the valley. Fortunately, she bumped into a Golden Shell Turtle who broke her momentum, allowing her to slow down and stand up.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle!" Nelly shouted, her face full of surprise.</p>

  <p>The woman that came through the Star Door this time was Rachelle, the consummate True God of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Rachelle was in a very sorry state. A section of hair on the top of her head had been cut. The remaining half of her disheveled hair fell down to one side, and there was a little mud on her forehead.</p>

  <p>Even in such a messy condition, she still looked utterly beautiful.</p>

  <p>Rachelle nodded at her briefly, but she didn't have time for small talk, as a Golden Shell Turtle had already started to attack her from behind.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was a consummate True God, after all. Sensing the attack before it began, she didn't even have to turn her head. In her hand, she swiveled the short scimitar. Immediately, a scarlet beam of light whistled toward the turtle.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Although the Golden Shell Turtle's armor was thick, it failed to resist Rachelle's slash and the turtle was sliced directly in half!</p>

  <p>Although the Golden Shell Turtle was obviously killed, a faint white curtain of light appeared on the turtle's surface just as it was hit by the scimitar. A scarlet beam of light bounced back from the light curtain and precipitated toward Rachelle!</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>In a blink, the scarlet beam of light landed on Rachelle's back before she even had the chance to react.</p>

  <p>The power of this strike was just the one Rachelle had just launched herself!</p>

  <p>Rachelle was a consummate True God, and even a casual strike from her was extremely powerful. The scarlet beam of light bounced directly onto her back and left an open, bloody wound. Several of her ribs had even broken with a vigorous snap. She bent down in pain and couldn't help but let out a loud groan.</p>

  <p>It was then that she looked behind her, and Rachelle couldn't believe her eyes. "Why are there even Golden Shell Turtles here?!" she asked angrily.</p>

  <p>The Golden Shell turtle's shell could bounce back any attacks it received.</p>

  <p>Rachelle had been too confident in herself. When she rushed in from the Star Door just moments ago, she didn't have much time to verify what kind of beast she was dealing with. Her first impression was that these beasts weren't even worth mentioning, and she paid a heavy price for her carelessness.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the other Golden Shell Turtles were also slowly crawling toward her, she endured the pain in her back and gently leapt up. With a flash, she arrived at the bottom of the Goddess Statue and sat down. She leaned against the tree block below the Goddess Statue dejectedly. Then, she gently drew a small circle in the void with her right hand, and a scarlet golden pill fell from the circle. She gently stretched her fingers out in order to grasp the golden pill. With a flick, the golden pill drew a parabola in the air and fell directly into her mouth.</p>

  <p>After swallowing the pill, her original tired face recovered greatly. Nelly, who had been silent beside her, asked with concern, "Rachelle, what happened out there? Can you tell me?"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods didn't care about the rewards in the first stage or even the second stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>However, many years ago, even the consummate True Gods had to fight their way in order to go to the higher stages of the forbidden land, together with ordinary True Gods. In other words, they still had to endure the attacks from waves of beasts beneath the Goddess Statue before they obtained the qualifications needed to reach the second stage.</p>

  <p>Later, a consummate True God found a space crack in the Time Sea Forbidden Land out of pure luck. If one used spatial transference, one could enter the second and even the third stages through the space crack.</p>

  <p>This was a shortcut that only the consummate True Gods could take.</p>

  <p>As a result, the consummate True Gods no longer explored along with the ordinary True Gods. After entering the Time Sea, all of the consummate True Gods would enter the third stage directly.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to Rachelle and the other consummate True Gods that the difficulty of exploring the Time Sea Forbidden Land had greatly increased. Now, they had provoked an extremely powerful monster on the third stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The strength of these consummate True Gods was also extremely great.</p>

  <p>They wanted to kill the monster, of course, but if they fought with the monster on the third stage of the forbidden area, they would alert other powerful creatures. After discussion, they decided to lure the monster to the first stage of the forbidden area, instead.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they fought while withdrawing along the space crack.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, as soon as the consummate True Gods retreated, they came into direct contact with more than two hundred of the other True Gods who had just withdrawn from the valley through the Star Door.</p>
