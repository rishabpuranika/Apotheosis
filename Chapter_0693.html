<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On Zheng's orders, Lily rushed towards a basaltic man and chopped its head with her thirty-foot long sword.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Whack!"</p>

  <p>A terrific sword with Lily the sword spirit was a match with astonishing power. There were only a few beasts in the Central Region that could ward off such fierce attack.</p>

  <p>The basaltic man was cut in half by Lily. Everyone watched the two halves of its body as it fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>There were about two hundred basaltic men in Zheng's territory. Although they appeared indestructible, Lily managed to kill them all one at a time.</p>

  <p>And basaltic men were very slow, even slower than the black turtles.</p>

  <p>'Lily should be able to deal with these men. And with the pagoda upgraded four times, she would have a lot of help, ' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Without a second thought, Luo Zheng ran towards the adjacent grassland.</p>

  <p>Shocked at Zheng's unusual move, the middle-aged warrior could not help but cry out, "This guy has already tasted the benefits. And now, he's going to steal from another competitor again!"</p>

  <p>Impressed, Michael and Xiao looked at each other and smiled. "He has the confidence to let his sword spirit fight off the basaltic men's attacks, and that's one of his abilities," Michael noted.</p>

  <p>Nodding, Xiao added, "This boy is quite interesting. He's smart as well."</p>

  <p>Sighing deeply, the middle-aged warrior exclaimed, "I'm afraid the warriors that he would steal from don't think so. By doing what he did, he could gain more points at each phase compared to others. So, he is likely to upgrade his pagoda level to eleventh or twelfth after the ten rounds of attacks."</p>

  <p>Not quite familiar with the magic array, Michael had to ask with curiosity,</p>

  <p>"Level eleven? Level twelve? There are only ten attacks arranged during the first phase. So that means the pagoda can only be upgraded ten times, right?"</p>

  <p>In reply, the middle-aged warrior explained, "When deploying the magic array, we considered the higher level of cultivation. Therefore, it is possible to upgrade the pagoda to the highest level, which is twelve. But normally, competitors don't have as many points to upgrade to level eleven or above."</p>

  <p>He wanted to add that the level eleven pagoda was as powerful as a warrior at the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, while the power of the level twelve pagoda was equivalent to that of the Virtual Tribulation Realm master.</p>

  <p>But before the middle-aged warrior could speak, Xiao interrupted, "Hey, that'll be interesting. I'd like to see this kid make a twelfth-level pagoda. I wonder what the other warriors' expressions would be like if he accomplishes that," he said. It would probably be fun to witness this.</p>

  <p>"It's not much fun," the middle-aged warrior said with a frown. Coldly, he added, "And it's unfair to other warriors."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is positively fair in this world. It's not that Luo Zheng is the only one capable of doing that. Anyone can steal other people's points. But only if they have the ability to do so," Michael stressed.</p>

  <p>And since Michael and Xiao didn't mind cheating, the middle-aged warrior could only turn a blind eye to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>From the Picture Slab, they saw Luo Zheng rushing towards the neighboring territory.</p>

  <p>It was a coincidence that the warrior of that territory was the white-faced man who had a conflict with Luo Zheng earlier in the hall.</p>

  <p>Even before Luo Zheng came, the warrior with a white face already faced some kind of trouble.</p>

  <p>The warrior with a white face was an independent fighter. He was formerly a disciple of a small, little-known second-grade sect in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Later, he had a conflict with an elder of that sect and rebelled against them.</p>

  <p>Since then, members of the second-grade sect wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>When they hunted for him, the white-faced warrior accidentally fell off a cliff. Luckily for the warrior, he ended up in a cave, where he found the legacy of an ancient cultivator who practiced sorcery. He came to rely on this discovery and made rapid progress in his training. It was not long before he entered the Internal Elixir Realm. Once he achieved this, he butchered members of the second-grade sect.</p>

  <p>The sorcery he practiced was called the Hatred Evil Attack, which was an effective fighting method against the enemy's soul. But basaltic men were made of stone, so they were immune to this method.</p>

  <p>Thus, the warrior with a white face was somehow overwhelmed by this. He realized he could only use the Stele Pusher skill to smash the basaltic men one by one.</p>

  <p>Although the Stele Pusher was only a tier 3 cultivation method, since he was in the Internal Elixir Realm anyway, his punch would carry tremendous power. However, power was one thing, and efficiency another, and he was not very efficient. So it would take three to four punches before he could break a basaltic man.</p>

  <p>Assessing the situation, he saw the basaltic men moving slowly. That meant he could destroy them before they reached the pagoda.</p>

  <p>When he saw a figure appeared in the distant sky and it rushed towards him, a look of surprise was written all over his face. But after he recognized who the visitor was, the surprise changed to a malicious look.</p>

  <p>The warrior with a white face was known to be a vengeful person. After all, he had butchered the second-grade sect after he reached the Internal Elixir Realm. During a previous meeting in the hall, Luo Zheng had offended him. So it was expected that he would seek revenge.</p>

  <p>What the warrior never expected was for Luo Zheng to seek him out before he could take the initiative to find the man who previously offended him.</p>

  <p>Confused, the warrior thought to himself. 'This is strange. Doesn't he have to fight the basaltic men on his territory? Why is he running around now?</p>

  <p>He doesn't seem concerned about a possible attack on his pagoda. Should that happen, it could mean elimination!'</p>

  <p>The warrior with a white face was even more surprised that after approaching him, instead of fighting with him, Luo Zheng began to cut his basaltic men even without looking at him.</p>

  <p>'What does he want?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>The warrior with a white face couldn't understand what was happening. Luo Zheng was indeed a real puzzle for him!</p>
