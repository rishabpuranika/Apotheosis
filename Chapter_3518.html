  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothy's words surprised Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The difference between the Soul of Light and the physical body was obviously vast.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea how powerful Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Snake Goddess were on the Other Shore, but at least on Stage Fourteen, there was a world of difference between the Soul of Light and the physical body.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Feng Ge's purified being body was much stronger than that of a normal creature on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know how you could be so confident," Feng Ge sneered, staring at Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do you want to find out? I can show you," Dorothy snapped in response.</p>

  <p>From their tone of voice, it was obvious the two women were raring for a fight.</p>

  <p>Zheng decided he could no longer just stay silent.</p>

  <p>He had never been good at dealing with relationship problems. Back then, the bickering between Margaret and Yudie had also troubled him a lot.</p>

  <p>Zheng strode over and stood between the two. He faced Dorothy, speaking to her gently, "This place is too dangerous for you. You can come back after Feng Ge and I deal with this matter."</p>

  <p>"I won't be a burden!" Dorothy retorted stubbornly.</p>

  <p>She had always brimmed with confidence, being the renowned talent of the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>This had only gone unnoticed because she had always been content to just play backup to Zheng, who tended to draw all the attention.</p>

  <p>She would never stand for being treated like a liability!</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to get in the way, then get out of here," said Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge!" Zheng hissed, a warning in his low voice.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge shrugged and took a step back, looking indifferent.</p>

  <p>Zheng then turned back to Dorothy. "I have never seen you as a burden.</p>

  <p>Without your help, I wouldn't have made it this far." He paused, before adding, "Besides, I've seen your door."</p>

  <p>While Dorothy and Feng Ge were both top women talents in the Oneness Sky Palace, they were different on essential points.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was the biological daughter of Flamine and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>She had inherited their bloodline.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it seemed that Dorothy didn't inherit the bloodline of Yasamin. No one had ever mentioned the reason to Zheng, but it didn't mean that he couldn't guess it.</p>

  <p>The reason why Yasamin still thought highly of Dorothy was not just that she cared for her and doted on her. It was because there was something special in Dorothy. Zheng had discovered in the Sacred Mallow Temple the sealed door that had been hidden within Dorothy's soul.</p>

  <p>Dorothy trembled at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"I happened to discover it when I made use of the Great Dominance Technique at that time," Zheng explained. "You don't need to deal with the weak creatures on Stage Fourteen. Just trust me and wait for us in the Land of Sword Grief, okay?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy decided to compromise.</p>

  <p>Although she could open the door after she reached Stage Fourteen, her grandma, indeed, cautioned her that she should only open it as a last resort.</p>

  <p>"All right." Dorothy nodded at Zheng. Then her eyes met Feng Ge's again.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't avoid her gaze, staring back coolly.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy snorted at Feng Ge as her soul finally dissipated.</p>

  <p>After Dorothy left, Feng Ge tilted her head. "You are in quite the dilemma, aren't you?" she asked Zheng with a playful smile.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you're talking about," Zheng muttered unconvincingly.</p>

  <p>"I'll make you understand, soon enough." Feng Ge smiled slyly, amusement glinting in her eyes.</p>

  <p>The stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace was now empty. Only Zheng and Feng Ge were left there.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the bronze palace in the Land of Sword Grief was now in an uproar!</p>

  <p>"Zheng and Feng Ge made short work of the members of the Tail Insect race!"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't that enrage the Ghost Scorpion?"</p>

  <p>"Pissing off the Ghost Scorpion in the Myriad Spirits City would only mean trouble! I shall go report on this matter!"</p>

  <p>Abdul exited the training room. Soon, the news had spread out.</p>

  <p>The news spread from the first floor to the second floor. The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were shocked to learn about this development.</p>

  <p>"Even if Feng Ge has a physical body, she still wouldn't be able to fight against the powerful creatures of Stage Fourteen."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid this means we can't take even a single step in the Desire World in the future!"</p>

  <p>"I really didn't expect them to cause such trouble!"</p>

  <p>But they could do nothing but wait anxiously.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to change the situation. There were some warriors who volunteered to enter the Other Shore to persuade Zheng and Feng Ge to come back, so the Oneness Sky Palace could send others to mediate in the dispute.</p>

  <p>However, this plan was rejected by Abdul and the others. They knew that given Zheng's and Feng Ge's personalities, they would not be persuaded easily.</p>

  <p>As the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief racked their brains on what to do, dozens of members of the Tail Insect race poured into a street from the north of the Myriad Spirits City, rushing forward at high speed from both sides.</p>

  <p>The living beings in the Myriad Spirits City were divided into different grades. The Tail Insect race was known for being domineering and bloodthirsty, and they grew even more unscrupulous after they pledged allegiance to the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>When the other creatures of the Other Shore saw them, they all scrambled out of their way.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Tail Insects were directly outside the wooden building of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>At one nod from the leader of the group, the other members of the race stretched out their hands, each of which held what appeared to be a green grass ball. The smell that emanated from the ball was like that of the Soul Interdicting Water and the Soul Binding Thread. Such an item was obviously used to prevent anything from leaving the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>The Tail Insects threw the grass balls through the open wooden doors.</p>

  <p>The balls exploded when they landed inside, diffusing a thick green smoke.</p>

  <p>Whoever was infected by this smoke would not be able to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Soon, a cloud of thick smoke had filled the wooden building. Just as the members of the Tail Insect race moved to raid the building, a voice came from behind them. "Are you looking for me?"</p>

  <p>The Tail Insects were stunned. The few who reacted quickly stomped their legs, causing their Other Shore Power to erupt. They waved the sharp cones in their hands and charged at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Too slow."</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still, not making a move at all.</p>

  <p>As the cones came toward him, Zheng just twisted slightly, evading them completely.</p>

  <p>His hands darted out.</p>

  <p>Biff, biff, biff!</p>

  <p>He plucked out the approaching creatures' heads, as easily if he were simply picking vegetables.</p>

  <p>Every head he plucked off was sent flying in the air. After doing that nine times in a row, Zheng stepped back. The bodies of the nine Tail Insects remained standing, even as their heads fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"How disappointing. Are these useless creatures all Master Ghost Scorpion can send to a fight?" Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>Having just witnessed the massacre of their peers, the compound eyes of the other members of the Tail Insect race gleamed with panic.</p>
