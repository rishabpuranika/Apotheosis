<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Daisy's stiff body suddenly trembled. She stared at Dorothy and said,</p>

  <p>"Dora, do you know what I've been through in the past few years? You can't crack a joke like this."</p>

  <p>Putting herself in Daisy's shoes, Dorothy realized she wouldn't have believed it either if she hadn't seen it for herself.</p>

  <p>Even so, she tried to convince Daisy again, "Aunt Daisy, you have seldom gone out over the years. I'm afraid that you don't know that I've met someone whose body can enter the Sea of Truth."</p>

  <p>"Can a corporeal body enter the Sea of Truth?" Daisy raised her eyebrows questioningly.</p>

  <p>Felicity joined in to explain, "Over a year ago, Dora first entered the Sea of Truth and met this guy. I heard that this person was called  Zheng Luo. He can roam through the Sea of Truth with his body."</p>

  <p>"If a corporeal body can enter the Sea of Truth, then he won't be afraid of the whirlpools," Daisy said looking convinced.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, she had spent her time gathering information about the whirlpools in the Sea of Truth. Although she did not know how they were produced, she still knew a great deal about them.</p>

  <p>She recalled what her husband had told her regarding them. One's Soul of Light would perish if it touched the water of the Sea of Truth. Thus, once a whirlpool appeared, one would get stuck and would not be able to escape.</p>

  <p>However, if there emerged someone who was not afraid of the water of the Sea of Truth, they might be able to deal with the whirlpools.</p>

  <p>But these people had disappeared over time. It was impossible to find someone who was not afraid of the water of the Sea of Truth in the present.</p>

  <p>Naturally, when Daisy heard that Dorothy had discovered someone who fit the description, she found it hard to believe.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded and continued, "When I got involved in the huge whirlpool, I also felt desperate as I remembered what had happened to Evaristus..."</p>

  <p>To make her story sound concrete, Dorothy had to repeat what had happened to her again.</p>

  <p>Felicity nodded in acknowledgment and said, "Daisy, Dora is not a girl who speaks nonsense. Besides, she doesn't want to disappoint you."</p>

  <p>Daisy showed no emotion the entire time Dorothy spoke. Suddenly, she sat up as her expression loosened. She gently clapped her hands together as if to summon something.</p>

  <p>A ghost-like figure emerged from outside the pavilion. "Master Daisy, what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Bring Evaristus here," said Daisy flatly.</p>

  <p>"But Master Evaristus..." The man seemed hesitant at this request. Over the years, Evaristus was known for his bad temper. He was addicted to alcohol and would ask for it every day. His tantrums were unpredictable and he would take them out on others. The servants were afraid to talk to him.</p>

  <p>"No matter what he is doing right now, bring him back to me!" A long lost smile appeared on Daisy's face.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng had returned from the Sea of Truth. As soon as he came back, he heard a hurried knock on the door.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!" It was the voice of Kenelm.</p>

  <p>Zheng removed the enchanted barrier as he got up to walk towards the door.</p>

  <p>He opened the door to see Kenelm out of breath; the latter had an anxious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Kenelm? Why are you so nervous?" Zheng asked as he tilted his head slightly.</p>

  <p>"Something's wrong! The Man-eating Demon Flowers from the Gracious Province are now in the Seven-Star City!" Kenelm said as he struggled to catch his breath.</p>

  <p>The Man-eating Demon Flowers resided in the Gracious Province. Over the years, they had colluded with the people of the Sand Country. Many people would get lost in the desert, but the Man-eating Demon Flowers never dared attack the major cities of the Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>Now, these Man-eating Demon Flowers had broken into the Seven-Star Province despite knowing all the consequences. It was likely the Excellence City was also in danger.</p>

  <p>"The Man-eating Demon Flowers have arrived at the Seven-Star City?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Due to the protective forces of the Sword Light Palace and the Lofty Sword, nonhuman creatures never dared to attack the Seven-Star Province.</p>

  <p>When Laura and Zheng were passing through the Sand Country, the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers did not dare approach them. How did the Man-eating Demon Flowers have the audacity to step foot in the Seven-Star City now?</p>

  <p>Zheng stood stunned upon receiving the news.</p>

  <p>"Yes! They are at the foot of the mountain now! The Sword Light Palace has asked to gather all the disciples from all the palaces. Let's go!" Kenelm urged him impatiently.</p>

  <p>As Zheng opened his mouth to ask more questions, he felt violent vibrations under his feet.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed realizing how serious the situation had gotten.</p>

  <p>After Zheng and Kenelm left the secluded room, they flew up and began to ascend in the air. They headed to the top of the Seven-Star City.</p>

  <p>As they flew up, Zheng turned around and squinted his eyes to stare at the ground. His pupils suddenly started shrinking.</p>

  <p>The Seven-Star Mountain was huge. It was ten million feet high and had tens of millions of houses and buildings built on the mountain. At the foot of the Seven-Star Mountain, six huge vines were breaking through the ground and climbing their way over it.</p>

  <p>Zheng figured the violent vibrations he had felt in the cultivation room were caused by the vines breaking through the ground.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Wherever the vines went, the buildings collapsed into piles of dirt and tiles with many True Gods buried under them.</p>

  <p>Countless Man-eating Demon Flowers were attached to the huge vines.</p>

  <p>They fell off the vines and rushed into the Seven-Star City to gobble up the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods that could fly were safe. However, the other True Gods and divine citizens who couldn't fly were unable to escape. They could only run for their lives before they were caught by the Man-eating Demon Flowers and eaten alive.</p>

  <p>In the air, Zheng could see the whole view of the Sever-Star Mountain. He saw the Man-eating Demon Flowers approach the Seven-Star City in high numbers, like a green tide rushing towards the city. In the blink of an eye, tens of millions of divine citizens became the food of the flowers who chewed on them with no mercy.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Zheng froze in the air. His body refused to move as he watched in a state of shock.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Snap out of it! Or it will be too late to leave," Kenelm urged.</p>

  <p>When the disciples heard the news, they began deserting the city one after the other. Kenelm had plucked up his courage to inform Zheng about the news.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's view, the strongest race among all was the human race. Whatever nonhuman creatures were, there were only two results for them. Either they got dominated by the human race or got killed by them.</p>

  <p>When he had been in the universe, Zheng had seen countless humans being slaughtered by the sorcerer race. However, the sorcerer race was a race created by Murphy, so it was still a war fought between different groups of humans.</p>

  <p>Watching humans get eaten alive by these flowers was hard for him to swallow. His heartbeat kept spiraling out of control.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>All hell broke loose when one side of the Seven-Star Mountain got tangled by one of the huge wines. It swept down half of the mountain, causing houses to collapse with it. Many divine citizens died as they got buried under it.</p>

  <p>At this moment, whether it was a True God or a divine citizen, their lives were as worthless as insignificant insects in the crevices.</p>

  <p>"The Sword Light Palace isn't afraid of the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers, is it? Why aren't they doing anything to stop these flowers?" Zheng asked as he watched the massacre in anger.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The most important thing to do right now is to run!" Kenelm cried out as he begged Zheng. He was only a disciple of the Sword Light Palace, so he had no idea of the intentions of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>The flowers quickly climbed the giant vines. Within a few seconds, they had reached the middle of the Seven-Star Mountain, not far away from Zheng and Kenelm. The two of them could even see the dense mass of Man-Eating Demon Flowers that were attached to the vines.</p>

  <p>"Waah..."</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng heard a sharp cry.</p>

  <p>He looked in the direction of the voice and saw a baby lying on the ground crying helplessly. Amidst the chaos, the divine citizens hadn't noticed it and kept running for their lives without realizing they had been walking all over its head.</p>

  <p>"Kenelm, you go first!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng spoke, he descended in a flash to rush to that street.</p>
