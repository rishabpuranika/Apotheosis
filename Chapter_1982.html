  <p>
</p>

  <p>A portion of the news regarding the Demon Night race and the ogres had already reached Luo Luo Zheng through the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Although the three great human forces weren't participating, they still paid considerable attention to the war between the races.</p>

  <p>Never had the two races been in harmony since the remote ages. Their supreme worlds intersected and for many years, there had never been a lack of warfare, including the full-fledged battles.</p>

  <p>Three great battles were recorded in history, namely 'Battle of the Setting Sun, ' 'Battle of Slaughtering the Ogres, ' and the 'Bloody Battle of the Illusory Spirit World.' In these great battles, the ogre and Demon Night races had sent out hundreds of millions of people to battle, where several Supreme Lords had fallen to death.</p>

  <p>The 'Battle of Slaughtering the Ogres' involved the joint attack of the Demon Night race and the Humanity Alliance on the ogres? the latter sustained great losses.</p>

  <p>According to history, the ogres normally played less than brilliant roles.</p>

  <p>The reckless, brutal, aggressive race wasn't welcomed in the universe? whether large or small the force, all were wary of the ogres.</p>

  <p>But this time, facing the Sacred race's invasion, the ogres had a sudden burst of courage and uprightness, wanting to resist the Sacred race even to death? it was a rather rare occasion for them to play a positive role As it turned out, the Demon Night race suddenly declared war on the humans before joining the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>'According to Holy Drew's conjecture, the Demon Night race was created by Murphy to be his hidden palms in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Does this mean that the ogre race was created by my father as a precaution?"</p>

  <p>As he continued searching for information, Luo Luo Zheng thought long and hard about the situation.</p>

  <p>Looking at the big picture, the possibility was quite high. Creating a race was an easy feat for Holy Beings. Luo Luo Zheng just couldn't wrap his head around why Mike would create the cruel and infuriating race of the ogres.</p>

  <p>In the current state of things, the Demon Night race had completely given up on their territory? their two queens had led the elite and rushed towards the center of the universe.</p>

  <p>But if the Demon Night race wanted to enter the Thoughtless Minds' territory, they first had to pass through the ogres' territory. Otherwise, they could join the Sacred race and enter the Thoughtless Minds through the Dark World.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for them, the ogres easily discovered this route as well.</p>

  <p>They then set up layers of defenses in the two worlds adjacent to the Dark World.</p>

  <p>After a few routes were blocked, the Demon Night race's advance was forcibly dragged down.</p>

  <p>But during this process, the ogres had paid a considerable price.</p>

  <p>Now, the entire race was also out while all the elites were placed in the Bloody Evil World, blocking Shania's team. At the time, the Queen of Punishment was leading another team, planning to join forces with Shania. Such was the sign of an oncoming fierce battle.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng got a hold of the situation, he continued obtaining information from the worlds' will.</p>

  <p>Although he held deep feelings for the Demon Night race, this time, he was afraid that once he launched his attacks, they would sever their friendship. Back then, he had also made promises to both Amber and Hailey which in this situation, Luo Luo Zheng didn't know how to fulfill.</p>

  <p>With his eyes shut, Luo Luo Zheng continued circulating the tremendous amount of information within the worlds' will.</p>

  <p>To understand the root cause, he used all his strength to collect memories about Yao. The pictures flickered in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>He saw the birth of an ordinary baby girl of the Demon Night race? she was Yao. Her bloodline had the entire race shocked? she was of extremely pure blood of the ancient Demon Night race, qualifying her for the throne.</p>

  <p>Scenes of Yao's life concentrated into dynamic pictures, each of which was drilled into Luo Zheng's very soul. In the end, a scene from two years ago appeared.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Yao's Soul-sealing Needle had awoken.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, accepting the refinement of Holy Drew, while Xun used her great willpower to erase the needle along with all her other memories.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Luo Zheng saw the scene of Yao gathering the members of the Demon Night race. He saw their incredulous expressions and the strong resistance they held against Yao. Even the Supreme Lords of the Demon Night didn't seem to approve of her decisions.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," Luo Luo Zheng murmured as the realization came over him.</p>

  <p>Just as what Holy Drew had said, the making of the Soul-sealing Needles was an extremely complicated process. Even Murphy, who was a Holy Being, couldn't seal the needles into too many people.</p>

  <p>For generations, that Soul-sealing Needle had only been passed down the souls of the queens of the Demon Night race. In the end, it was activated in Yao and Ying's generation.</p>

  <p>So this declaration of war against the human race and joining the Sacred race were entirely under the two queens' orders. The other people of the Demon Night weren't affected by the Soul-sealing Needle.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Demon Night race's members regarded themselves as a part of their own universe. While they originally hated the Sacred race, they had no choice but to obey the queens' orders.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, we only need to kill Yao and Shania." Luo Zheng's eyes turned cold as he took out the Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>Although the Supreme Lords might have had some misgivings towards the Demon Night race, they were willing to pool their strength against the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng returned, he hadn't displayed his full strength. Now was the time to do so, and the Demon Night race was to be Luo Zheng's first target.</p>

  <p>In one world of the Demon Night race was a place called Prison Island.</p>

  <p>One by one, cyan soldering iron pillars rose up from the ground like huge chimneys.</p>

  <p>In the air above the Prison Island, a brilliant light suddenly shone.</p>

  <p>It wasn't lighting? it was the Space Law Storm.</p>

  <p>The instant the storm was released, a figure shot out from within.</p>

  <p>In Prison Island were kept the most important prisoners of the Demon Night race? most of them were people who had been imprisoned under the orders of the Queen of Punishment herself. None were nameless.</p>

  <p>It was to be expected that the guards of the prison were especially strong.</p>

  <p>In the past, Prison Island had 12 world lords of the Demon Night race guarding it in turns.</p>

  <p>But with Yao and Shania having convened nearly all the powerful warriors of the Demon Night race, there were only two world lords left to guard the prisoners.</p>

  <p>On the tallest observation platform of the island, Fannie, a world lord of the Demon Night race, carried a longbow as tall as her on her back as she looked at the blazing white storm in the sky.</p>

  <p>Her eyes turned a pale yellow and she began seeing three red dots circling the sky. The three dots eventually converged into one and locked onto the figure rapidly descending from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Intruder! A human warrior! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Even the warriors of the Demon Night race would be killed if they approached the Prison Island so casually, let alone a human intruder.</p>

  <p>Fannie didn't hesitate as she gently waved her slender arms. In an instant, the longbow was already drawn and an azure spiral began condensing on the bowstring.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Under the convergence of the spiral, a fluctuation of energy appeared that could cause one's heart to palpitate.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The spiral left a ten-thousand-foot-long trail in the air as it shot towards the figure in a fierce and precise speed.</p>

  <p>Though her opponent was a world lord, he couldn't dodge her arrow.</p>

  <p>Fannie was rather confident in her archery skills? the longbow in her hand was a first-rank divine weapon, gifted to her by the island's master before leaving.</p>

  <p>The spiral grew closer and closer until it finally hit the target accurately before exploding. The turbulence created a violent storm, completely annihilating the target.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" Fannie murmured to herself as she stared at the sky.</p>

  <p>When the storm dissipated, she saw a figure descend? or perhaps, the figure was falling.</p>

  <p>'He should be dead already. The human world lord can't even withstand a single blow. How weak, ' Fannie thought. Hefting her longbow, she jumped into the air like an agile rabbit. Then, she flew nimbly through the air, heading straight for her target.</p>

  <p>Just as her target fell to the ground, Fannie arrived at his side. But at the sight of the target, her expression turned incredulous.</p>

  <p>The human world lord was lying in a large hole he had caused, slowly climbing to his feet. Then, he raised his head to give Fannie a smile.</p>

  <p>The man was completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>A chill ran down her spine as Fannie saw the scene. Immediately, she raised her hand and shot out an arrow.</p>

  <p>Condensing an arrow, drawing the bow, aiming at the target, shooting the arrow?such movements had already become instinctual to Fannie. With all this happening in a single breath, there was simply no time for the opponent to even react.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The huge pit before them had burst out another storm and expanded to over twice its original size. When the storm dissipated, the figure of the human who had just fallen into the pit appeared once again. All the while, he wore a faint smile on his face, completely unharmed.</p>
