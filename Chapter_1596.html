<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unable to challenge the rules of the hook.</p>

  <p>The square boulders in the second hall had originally been ordinary stones. But because they contained a rule of the heavens, Luo Zheng was unable to move the boulders the slightest bit, even if he burst out with all his might.</p>

  <p>In this universe, only a Supreme Lord could break through a certain level of the rules of the heavens. At this point in time, Zheng's strength was far from that.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng finished speaking, his gaze landed on Hailey.</p>

  <p>This quiet Demon Night woman held a longbow in one hand and a long hook in the other. She looked at the other side, her eyes brimming with caution.</p>

  <p>Moon Bursting Flame Bow!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng looked at the bow, his eyes glinted. He had already made up his mind. "Perhaps," he said, "I can be a stupid person for once."</p>

  <p>When Jeffrey and Janet heard Luo Zheng, doubt appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>As for the absent-minded Coleman, he was even more confused. "You want to get hooked over?"</p>

  <p>What happened to Damon had been a terrible lesson.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were to be hooked by his opponents, his end result would be the same as Damon's. They would use the long hooks in their hands to jostle him and then easily kill him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps!" Luo Zheng said, shrugging lightly. It was a chaotic energy transmission that carried over his words. Although there was a distance of three thousand feet between the two sides, a martial artist's hearing sense was good enough to hear Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Time quietly passed by in this confrontation.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors in the Hall of Causality were starting to feel anxious.</p>

  <p>Almost all the martial artists who entered this place could make it into the top three hundred of the supreme world.</p>

  <p>But the competition in the Illusion Battlefield was becoming more and more intense, and the other warriors at the top of the ranks were gaining Illusion Points at a heightening speed. If they got nothing here, their ranks would plummet. Anyone who did not gain enough points would decline in the rankings.</p>

  <p>During the confrontation, the martial artists outside of the Halls of Causality were gaining Illusion Points at an insane speed. Thus, the rankings of the warriors in here were naturally falling.</p>

  <p>Every time they checked their rankings, they would realize that they had slipped by one or two spots.</p>

  <p>"Lone, are we going to wait like this forever?" someone cried out.</p>

  <p>Lone sat in the same spot. His gaze was fixed on the endlessly churning mist. He asked with a smile, "And why can't we wait?"</p>

  <p>"But�"</p>

  <p>"The other side should be even more anxious than us," Lone said airily.</p>

  <p>"They will lose their patience sooner or later."</p>

  <p>Truthfully, Lone was not so confident at this moment.</p>

  <p>It was not that he did not believe in his abilities. If the third Hall of Causality only meant for the two sides to kill each other, then the problem would be easy to solve.</p>

  <p>He alone was enough to deal with the seven warriors on the other side. It was not a difficult matter for him.</p>

  <p>However, just like what the warrior across the deep ravine had said, strength was not the key to victory in the Hall of Causality. Rather, it all depended on who had a grasp on the rules within.</p>

  <p>Damon was indeed very strong, and among the ten of them, probably his strength was merely second to Lone's. This was why Lone could sit back and let Damon get hooked over. He believed that Damon would have enough time to pull him over as well.</p>

  <p>But the outcome had been surprising.</p>

  <p>Damon was tricked into getting killed by his opponents. He did not even get the opportunity to fight back.</p>

  <p>His death made Lone more vigilant.</p>

  <p>Swish�</p>

  <p>A long hook suddenly flew out. But eventually, the attack still failed.</p>

  <p>Both sides tried to probe each other, but in vain. They were unable to lock onto the other. It was as if they were fishing in a dark river, helplessly unaware about when and if at all their targets would take the bait.</p>

  <p>Apart from the long hooks, the two sides tried other attacks as well, including throwing knives and bows. But in the end, they did not succeed. Neither of the sides found it difficult to dodge such attacks.</p>

  <p>Swiftly, Luo Zheng left the fog and came to stand before everyone on the other side.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng appeared, the nine people led by Lone stared, confusion marring their faces.</p>

  <p>"Did he just emerge from the fog to emulate Damon? Is he wanting to be hooked over by us?"</p>

  <p>"Does he want to be friends with death? He's not even strong like Damon!"</p>

  <p>"So what if he was strong like Damon? If he gets hooked over, we could easily kill him, just like how they killed Damon."</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>In the darkness, some warriors were so eager to try and kill Luo Zheng, wanting to throw their long hooks at him.</p>

  <p>When Lone saw Luo Zheng, at first he remained quiet. He then said in an indifferent tone, "Wait a moment."</p>

  <p>Lone's brow creased as he looked at Luo Zheng. They had already killed Damon, so it was obvious that Luo Zheng understood the rules of the hooks in their hands.</p>

  <p>Once the target was ensnared by the hook, his or her skills were gone, due to which he or she was unable to fight back.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, the person before them still dared to leave the Illusive Fog. He was either a fool or someone with a scheme in his head.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Lone's voice floated over the darkness.</p>

  <p>"You're the one who just spoke. Were you the one who killed Damon?"</p>

  <p>His tone was full of apathetic arrogance. An air of patronization seeped into his words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked through to the darkness on the other side. His gaze landed in the direction the voice had come from. His magical eyes were activated, and he saw a blurry figure sitting quietly in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was me. Do you have a problem with it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Are you not afraid of death, now that you have revealed your position?"</p>

  <p>Lone asked again.</p>

  <p>"Hah! It's not like I will meet my real death here. In the Illusion Battlefield, everything is a mere projection. Why should I be scared?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Lone stared at Luo Zheng dispassionately as a hint of hesitation appeared on his face. Since the enemy was willing to show himself, he must have already made up his mind. Lone frowned as he tried to figure out what Luo Zheng was planning.</p>

  <p>The third Hall of Causality they were in was like a game of wits. Only by relying on one's deeper understanding of the rule could one take the initiative to make their move. Lone had always been a conceited person.</p>

  <p>But now, facing Luo Zheng, he felt a little uneasy and worried.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of throwing your hook?"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng smiled, he was a bit anxious in his heart.</p>

  <p>If the one on the other side did not want to hook on to him, he had no way to exercise his next move.</p>

  <p>"Since none of you is willing to throw your hook, let me do it!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He had only caught the glimpse of a vague shadow in the darkness, but his long hook still shot out and flew straight to the person sitting in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The long hook was like a shuttle, reaching its target in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The speed at which Luo Zheng threw the long hook reached its peak, but Lone's reaction was not slow either. He moved two feet aside and easily dodged Zheng's hook. Out of confidence, he had only moved a couple of feet.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had never intended to get Lone by the hook. His action had only been a provocation of sorts. It was similar to what Damon had done. Damon had provoked Luo Zheng through his words, but Luo Zheng was goading Lone through his action.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not pause even for a moment when his hook missed its target.</p>

  <p>His vision was already firmly locked onto the blurry, skinny figure. The long hook in his hand once again shot out.</p>

  <p>Whoosh �</p>

  <p>As the long hook flew toward Lone, his figure moved a few more feet to avoid the hook.</p>

  <p>Once...</p>

  <p>Twice...</p>

  <p>Thrice�</p>

  <p>Again and again, Luo Zheng struck out with his hook, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>He wore a faint smile on his face, seeming very patient.</p>

  <p>Lone, who still resided in the darkness, finally had a look of anger on his face.</p>

  <p>Swish�</p>

  <p>As he dodged Zheng's hook, the long hook in his own hand shot out and charged straight at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Finally!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed. This was the moment he had been waiting for.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the long hook rush to drag him into it, he smiled. The long hook halted all of a sudden, not too far away from him.</p>

  <p>Lone grabbed the chain at the end of the long hook and forcibly pulled it back.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng looked in the direction of the retracting hook, a devious look surfaced in his eyes. "Why? Why are you withdrawing it?"</p>

  <p>No one said a word in the darkness on the other side, but soon after, a sharp Mu Ning emerged from the darkness. It was Lone.</p>

  <p>"Lone, why didn't you make a move?" a warrior asked.</p>

  <p>"He would die if you hooked him over. Why did you hesitate?" Some of the warriors were utterly perplexed at Lone's lack of action.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Lone stood up and looked at Luo Zheng from head to toe. A sense of foreboding had enveloped him the moment he raised the hook, so he withdrew it at the last moment.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors around him could not hold it in any longer. One of them suddenly lashed out a long hook at Luo Zheng. Lone did not have the chance to stop him.</p>
