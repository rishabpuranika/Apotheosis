<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3176 Sudden Change </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Jermain snorted arrogantly on seeing Whitlock's smug face. "An opportunist such as yourself actually believes he can win this. Are you out of your mind, Whitlock?" Jermain said teasingly.</p>

  <p>He then pushed down on his feet and smashed his stone onto that of the Ivory Mountain without a second thought.</p>

  <p>The battle between the Origin Mountain and Ivory Mountain was fierce, but almost everyone else had their focus pinned on Feng Ge and Zheng.</p>

  <p>The intense and dramatic chase between them had eventually led them to the edge of the cave.</p>

  <p>Mekhi and the others who sat on the huge stone of the Flow Sword Sect, felt dizzy and nauseas under the violent shakes Zheng used to dodge Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng now had full control of the stone, and all they had to do was share the weight with him.</p>

  <p>When Mekhi noticed the huge stone of the Origin mountain was getting quite close to the metal mountain, he cried out to Feng Ge to tell her this in hope she would give up her chase of them to go deal with the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>But this revelation didn't seem to bother her in the slightest. She was determined to remove the Flow Sword Sect from the competition.</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge edged even closer, the two huge stones flew inches from the walls of the cave as well.</p>

  <p>The tiniest mistake here would cost them everything, even touching a little bump on the cave walls would wipe them out.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had planned to stay away from the wall but Feng Ge and her huge stone had swerved and blocked his way, forcing him to turn the opposite direction to dodge it.</p>

  <p>The dodge had caused him to enter a long, narrow crack on the north side of the cave.</p>

  <p>Cheers sounded from those supporting Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, you win!"</p>

  <p>"Finish him!"</p>

  <p>"This guy moves so fast!"</p>

  <p>Victory was within her grasp and yet there was no trace of it on her face.</p>

  <p>She did not appear excited but disappointed instead.</p>

  <p>Everyone else was too weak for her and the only one she had found a bit challenging had fled into the crack.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she had an idea, and steered the huge stone to rush into the crack.</p>

  <p>Now Zheng would have practically no room to dodge any attacks. The crack only allowed two stones at a time to move within. If either one of them lost focus for a second, they would crash hard on the walls of the cave.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has nowhere to go."</p>

  <p>"It seems the Flow Sword Sect loses in the end..."</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have run to the north; it's a dead end. His inexperience shows.</p>

  <p>The Golden Mountain and Killing Sword Sect were wiped out last time because they were trapped in that crack."</p>

  <p>Everyone shook their heads. They had expected this result would come eventually.</p>

  <p>The elite disciples of the Flow Sword Sect were not ready for it to end yet however. They clenched their fists and held on tight. Even now when their odds were slim, Konnor and the others still hoped they'd pull through, by some miracle if necessary.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as he saw the huge stone with Feng Ge at the helm coming straight towards them. "Everyone, stand firm!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Then the boulder beneath his feet suddenly sank. Instead of retreating, it rushed forward to escape the crack.</p>

  <p>"You are courting death."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge narrowed her eyes, stunned by his boldness.</p>

  <p>In a small space like this, if Zheng dared approach her, all she needed to do was get a touch on his stone and he'd be knocked out; there was no chance of dodging her here.</p>

  <p>But suddenly the stone Zheng stood on sped up massively!</p>

  <p>Before Feng Ge could hit him, he maneuvered right over her in the crack above. Those behind Feng Ge did not have time to get out of the way and were swept off by Zheng's huge rock.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not take this opportunity to escape. Instead he charged at Feng Ge from behind, taking advantage of all the momentum he had.</p>

  <p>The tables had turned, and now it was Feng Ge who was desperate for a way out.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! Can anyone tell me what just happened?"</p>

  <p>"How did Zheng get out? Did he not touch the wall?"</p>

  <p>Tacy made a gesture on the metal mountain and announced, "Neither of them has touched the wall."</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, Feng Ge is likely to lose now!"</p>

  <p>"I still don't understand what happened..."</p>

  <p>The faces of those backing Feng Ge darkened. They had never expected such speed and skill from Zheng.</p>

  <p>Finally Feng Ge's face changed, but it was not frustration or anything of the sort. Now she was visibly excited.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, she stood up and smashed against an elite who was under the direct command of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>This elite had stood on the enchanted barrier rune all this time, in case Feng Ge required him to open the enchanted barrier at any moment.</p>

  <p>However, no order had come and so he had been nothing but useless.</p>

  <p>The violent collision sent him flying out of the huge stone. He shouted back in desperation, "Your...Your Highness... Why..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge ignored him and stepped into the rune. She released the truth aura in her body and her thin red lips began to move slightly.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood at the front of his stone, staring hard at Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>No matter how certain victory might have seemed, he refused to let his guard down. He saw Feng Ge's lips moving slightly and a strange thought came to him.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for him to read lips, but he needed a second to make sure he understood. Suddenly, Zheng's eyes narrowed in great concern. He was probably the only one who understood what she was chanting!</p>

  <p>Had Feng Ge also comprehended the follow-up of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent?</p>

  <p>Was it not said that even Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself hadn't deciphered the two Sanskrit words? What he was witnessing went against the rumors for sure.</p>

  <p>However, it was too late...</p>

  <p>Patterns started to flash in strange light on the huge stone beneath Feng Ge's feet, and a circle of thick radiance burst out from it.</p>

  <p>As the enchanted barrier expanded, the narrow crack swelled open immensely.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier continued to expand at fast speed. When the stone of the Flow Sword Sect bumped into the enchanted array, it was bounced off by a powerful force and rocketed in the cave in a blitz as if it had been grabbed and flung by a mighty beast.</p>

  <p>"What happened now?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't the point of this game to control the huge stones to hit the others'?</p>

  <p>Why is this so different from what I have experienced before?"</p>

  <p>"What a powerful enchanted barrier!"</p>

  <p>The people who watched the fight from the sidelines were stunned. They could not comprehend what was taking place between Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>It was not only them, even Winchell, Goran and the other powerful figures also seemed puzzled. First, Zheng maneuvered the huge stone of the Flowing Sword Sect with a mysterious method, and then Feng Ge suddenly displayed the same ability. What was going on?</p>

  <p>So Goran, Winchell and the old man all looked at Athemar. However, when they saw Athemar's dumbfounded expression, they didn't bother to ask him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he was as lost as they were.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The wind whistled past the ears of those on the Flow Sword Sect's stone.</p>

  <p>They gritted their teeth and held on tight, trying desperately not to be thrown from the rock. But they were flying too fast and would soon collide with the other side of the cave.</p>

  <p>Zheng used the Might Godly Way to fix himself to the giant stone, so he didn't have to worry about being flung off. He slid on the stone and came to the enchanted barrier rune as well.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The huge stone of the Flow Sword Sect spread a powerful and thick enchanted barrier as well. As soon as it opened out, the stone bumped into the wall in the front and bounced back, slowly stabilizing.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge stood at the front of her huge stone, slowly and calmly emerging from the swollen crack. Her indifferent smile now got wilder. She opened her mouth and spread her ethereal voice in the air, "Efrain did not come, neither did Chaim. And even Milo is absent. I had thought that the Seven Mountains Meeting would be boring and without any challenges this time..."</p>
