<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 325 Sword Granting (Part Three) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The black fire that she witnessed, did not emit any heat. It might have sealed its heat so perfectly that it looked like a flame-like creature instead of a flame itself.</p>

  <p>Then again, having this indescribable ability to conceal all of its heat which was supreme, how really powerful could the black fire be?</p>

  <p>No one knew for sure, not even its owner Zheng.</p>

  <p>He just knew that so far, there hadn't been a single thing that the black fire could not destroy. Even those upper scale mysterious weapons that were made of the hardest material in the world, it could just as easily scorch them and dissolve them into heavenly essence before enjoying it.</p>

  <p>In its eyes, everything was just as soft and weak as candles and it could just easily make them his food.</p>

  <p>The silence in the room prevailed. The woman glanced at Zheng with a rather pensive look for a moment before she finally resumed, "You just proved that you have a special fire although I am not sure that if it is a fire spirit or what. But anyway, the main question is: how are you not a weapon refiner?" A look of doubt appeared across her elegant face.</p>

  <p>"I admit I am not a weapon refiner." Zheng smiled in a meek manner and continued, "However, I am very positive that I will be a weapon refiner one day. And I strongly believe that the day will come very soon. And I am pretty sure that I have the ability to refine this sword into a fairy weapon. So do trust my abilities!" His voice was infused with irresistible determination.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng hadn't been able to accumulate all the skills required to be a weapon refiner yet. But the major point of the entire thing was, he had now gathered more heavenly essences than any other person. And everyone knew that heavenly essence was the critical element in the process of refining weapons.</p>

  <p>But what seemed funny was now a young man with no weapon refiner's degree or any relevant experience was claiming that he could refine Chase's final work into a fairy weapon. This idea would have inevitably been mocked and teased if this woman had not witnessed his black fire with her own eyes just a few moments back. With her original hope to unmask his lie, now the woman began to hesitate over her decision. She never once considered that she would have to part with the sword. She started to believe that Zheng could not be an ordinary, common person with the abilities he just showcased. He seemed to have a more depth of mystery than she thought he possessed.</p>

  <p>She recalled the words her mentor had always said when he was alive.</p>

  <p>'When could we have a talented person in Eastern Region? I am afraid I could not live that long to see one rise.'</p>

  <p>A strong, vivid feeling struck her heart that maybe the time that her mentor had always longed for had now finally come, and Zheng might be the person that her mentor referred to. And if that were true, there was no other option for her but to hand the sword out. She had to give it a shot and let loose of it now that she had gotten a glimpse of how powerful Zheng was. With a gentle smile she consented, "Of course I will keep my promise." And without any delay and hesitation, she snapped her fingers and motioned the storekeeper to come in. After the man had entered, she ordered, "Manager Qi, grant the sword to this gentleman."</p>

  <p>Manager Qi was taken aback upon hearing her request. He did not move at once, wondering if he had heard her wrong. He was confused as to what happened when he left just a moment ago. After all, the sword was the most precious thing that she had ever kept in so many years after Chase's death. 'Although this young man looks extraordinary and seems to posses some special talents, is he really competent enough to earn that sword?' he contemplated with a look of awe.</p>

  <p>Noting his concern, the woman explained to clarify his mounting doubts,</p>

  <p>'He has passed the test. So I need to keep my promise and reward the sword to him."</p>

  <p>She seemed to have made up her mind. There were no way around it.</p>

  <p>After receiving the clear direction from his boss, Manager Qi came out from his trance and gave the sword to Zheng.</p>

  <p>After receiving the sword from Manager Qi, Zheng cupped his hands in front and bowed slightly to show his respects and gratitude to the woman for granting the sword.</p>

  <p>The woman nodded her head and said in an absent tone, "Well, I didn't grant you the sword because I thought you were the best option I saw. It is just that there hasn't been an exceptional weapon-refining master in Eastern Region for many years now. I once wanted to give it to Brady and the other master, but they both refused. I am not sure how much longer I have to wait to find another distinguished weapon-refining master. Leaving it here is just wasting time. I can see that you have got some power, talent and determination in you. If you are really sure about your abilities, then you can give it a go. Like what Chase wrote in his will, 'Everything has its fate, the sword will choose the right person when the right time comes.' You liked it at your first glimpse, maybe you two were destined to take this journey together."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded with gratitude and thanked her once again before taking his leave. On his way back, he was filled with excitement and happiness. He was anxious to find out what kind of weapon he could refine it into using his heavenly essence and strength.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile at the Weapon Pavilion, a small argument was sparked between Manager Qi and the woman. Unlike the subservient look he displayed earlier, Manager Qi now stood upright and frowned at the woman as he accused her, "What have you just done? You disobeyed our original rule, are you aware of that?" His voice was strong with protest and disdain.</p>

  <p>With a careless shrug, the woman shook her head absently. Her eyes averted to the furnace in which her fire spirit was still trembling in utter fear caused from seeing Zheng's black fire back then. After a short pause, she said in a tone intertwined with contempt and mockery, "Rule? Rules mean nothing in comparison to the dull reality. When was the last time you saw a talented master in the whole Eastern Region who had the capability to make a difference? I think I have lost track also now.</p>

  <p>Maybe there was one, the one who has been imprisoned in the Hell Mountain and there is no way to escape at the moment. Now the situation has got worse and messier. I am afraid if this turmoil goes on any longer, the whole Eastern Region will break down eventually and become an unknown, stark place that no one would like to come to."</p>

  <p>Manager Qi shrank back with shock as he accepted what just happened.</p>

  <p>Much as he had been choosing to neglect the reality, he knew in his heart that the atmosphere in Eastern Region was becoming tense and uneasy.</p>

  <p>What she was saying was true and with that he decided to be silent. But no matter what, giving such a precious sword to such a young man still seemed like a slack and reckless decision. "But that young fellow is just a…" he paused, not knowing how he should express Zheng's level properly.</p>

  <p>His face was drowning in a confused and querulous look.</p>

  <p>"Just a what? A nature creature? So far, I have never been wrong at predicting people's future and judging their character. He might be just a nature creature at the moment, but I don't believe he will be at Cloud Sect forever. Very soon, he will be on his way to the upper level, and when the time comes, the sword we gave him will come in handy as a superior and transformed weapon," she said optimistically. As she spoke, a golden, radiant light shimmered in her large, attentive eyes. She looked as if a gorgeous, elegant peacock that was looking down at the other birds while displaying her enchanting, affectionate demeanor.</p>

  <p>"What makes you so confident of his abilities?" inquired Manager Qi.</p>

  <p>The fear still persisted on his face.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled and turned to the furnace. "You were not in the room when the test was carried out and that is why you remain so doubtful about my decision while I have confidence in his abilities. But even now look at the fire spirit in the furnace! I think it would explain everything to you," she humbly requested.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Manager Qi turned to follow the direction of the woman's gaze.</p>

  <p>To his shock, the fire spirit was trembling violently as if something bad and horror had frightened it.</p>

  <p>Manager Qi's face turned pale in astonishment at the sight. It was the first time he saw the fire spirit in such an agitated, frightened state.</p>

  <p>"Why? What made it so terrified?" he wondered.</p>
