<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xun and Yudie looked at each other silently. Both of them were feeling a bit disappointed.</p>

  <p>Neither of the girls were unreasonable people. They hadn't been to the divine land yet, but had a good general understanding of the place.</p>

  <p>Since they had just recently become low-rank True Gods, it was still difficult for them to move around in a large region, not to mention to search for Zheng in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Right then, an indifferent voice said, "I don't care how long you're going to wait! I'm leaving today! With or without you!"</p>

  <p>Margaret, dressed in blue, walked straight out of a door.</p>

  <p>Joy followed closely behind Margaret. A helpless expression was etched on her delicate face.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, Margaret had gradually become a mid-rank True God, and the process went off without a hitch.</p>

  <p>Joy had tried her best to cultivate Margaret, very amazed with her great talent.</p>

  <p>As the Purple Soul Hall's founder, Joy recruited plenty of women who possessed the Purple Power Bodies. However, in all her time, she had never met such a talented disciple.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng was an exception among them all. He was different from other people.</p>

  <p>In Joy's eyes, Margaret was like a piece of jade that Mike had carefully prepared for her. It had also been very interesting for Joy to train Margaret in the fairy palace over the past few years.</p>

  <p>She even believed that it wouldn't be long before Margaret became a consummate True God. Joy had so much faith in Margaret that she thought she might even become a Demi-holy Being in the future.</p>

  <p>The only problem was that Margaret was extremely willful. Thus, Joy had to spend most of her time calming Margaret down.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Augustus took a step forward and stood in front of Margaret. His shadow completely covered her.</p>

  <p>He was tall, with a wicked smile on his face. "No one is stopping you.</p>

  <p>The fairy palace's gate is open. You can go anywhere you want!"</p>

  <p>Margaret looked up at Augustus and met his glare, her eyes fuming with rage.</p>

  <p>After having stayed in the fairy palace for a short period of time, she began to regret it. She was always clamoring to leave to find Zheng.</p>

  <p>It only happened once in the past that Augustus really allowed her to leave the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Despite that, she still couldn't find her way out of the large Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>The huge trees, tall grasses, streams, and rivers seemed to have grown their own feet. They changed positions at any given moment. From time to time, fierce giant apes would pass by, which scared Margaret to death.</p>

  <p>Never had she expected that after running away, she would once again find herself at the gate of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Augustus had personally turned the place into a huge maze. He could change any route or path he desired, so how could Margaret ever possibly escape?</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The purple internal momentum dispersed outward from Margaret's body.</p>

  <p>Whiz!</p>

  <p>The four swords had besieged Augustus out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Annoyed, Margaret employed the Gods Killing Sword Array and the Buddha Emperor Sword came slashing at Augustus's head at once.</p>

  <p>If a mid-rank True God was surrounded by the Gods Killing Sword Array, it would be difficult for them to escape. Even top-rank True Gods would be in a dangerous position.</p>

  <p>However, Augustus was a top consummate True God and he equally controlled the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was safe to say that Margaret was no match for him.</p>

  <p>Facing the Buddha Emperor Sword, Augustus gently grasped it, immobilizing the sword completely with a single hand.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no way Margaret was going to give up. In an instant, the Buddha Emperor Sword turned into a ball of purple light and escaped from his hand. Simultaneously, the other three swords began to move, slashing fatally forward.</p>

  <p>Despite its intensity, the others were used to this kind of scene, so they didn't have any reaction.</p>

  <p>And Joy was glad to see that they all kept their calm. In this case, there was a consummate True God who practiced the skill with Margaret, which was clearly a good thing for her, to say the least.</p>

  <p>During the battle, a space fluctuation suddenly occurred at the front of the square, near the entrance of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Xun, Margaret, and Yudie didn't take any notice. Their cultivation was still in a low level.</p>

  <p>But Joy, Saul and Hallet all looked toward the door at the exact same time.</p>

  <p>As for Augustus, he, of course, sensed that something was off. He was integrated as one with the entire Swirl Forest, and could notice everything happening there as soon as it occurred.</p>

  <p>The space fluctuation happened without the slightest warning. It seemed that someone had returned by activating the token of mountain.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>While Augustus was lost in thought, the Buddha Emperor Sword cracked him over the head.</p>

  <p>Although the Buddha Emperor Sword formed from the purple light was powerful, it couldn't cause damage to Augustus's physical body, because he was extremely tough. Under this strike, Augustus didn't suffer any damage, but the Buddha Emperor Sword turned into a cloud of purple light...</p>

  <p>Margaret suddenly noticed that everyone was paying attention to the fairy palace's entrance. She was slightly stunned and asked, "What's wrong? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>As she turned her head around, she saw Zheng appear at the door, dressed in cyan.</p>

  <p>Ever since Margaret entered the fairy palace, any news she ever heard about Zheng was bad. She had been worried about him, and she had reason for such.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, she remained confident in Zheng the entire time.</p>

  <p>As long as she didn't see Zheng's corpse, she wouldn't believe that he died!</p>

  <p>She would have to see it with her own eyes to believe it!</p>

  <p>"Honey!"</p>

  <p>Margaret was the first to rush over to the front door. As she moved, rays of purple light enveloped her body.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Margaret slammed directly into Zheng's open arms and tears began rolling down from her eyes, as if she had suffered a lot while staying in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>When the others noticed that Zheng had returned, they had different expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Oh? In just ten years, your cultivation base has already reached the same level as mine. Ha-ha!" Augustus curled his lips and his face contorted into an expression of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Among the three disciples Bromley had accepted, Augustus always believed that he was the most talented. As a result, he wanted to teach Zheng a hard lesson upon meeting him for the first time. He, on his behalf, wouldn't be nice like Hallet.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was also quite jealous of Zheng's great talent. And more importantly, he was afraid that Zheng would surpass him one day.</p>

  <p>That said, it seemed that he had no reason to be worried from now on.</p>

  <p>Zheng had become a consummate True God over the last ten years, and he hadn't just surpassed Augustus.</p>

  <p>No one else could ever make that kind of progress, especially not that fast, during so many divine eras.</p>

  <p>When Harold, Hallet and Joy noticed Zheng's cultivation base, they were also surprised. Their jaws dropped in awe.</p>

  <p>According to their conjecture, it wouldn't be easy for Zheng to become a consummate True God. It was possible that he could succeed in a few hundred years or even a thousand years, while to the divine land, such a period of time was considered short.</p>

  <p>Where could Zheng have been in the past ten years?</p>

  <p>If the rumors spreading from the Floating Islands were true, Zheng had no chances of survival.</p>

  <p>Although Harold didn't say anything, he had suspected once before that Zheng might have died under the Han Clan's ancestral land.</p>

  <p>For this reason, he had already secretly searched for one of Zheng's substitutes, Nathan.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, they had many questions in their minds, but since Margaret was hugging Zheng like there was no one else around, it was improper for them to be disturbed right then.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt Margaret, who he held tightly in his arms, tremble slightly. He could sense that she was truly excited...</p>

  <p>Compared to Yudie's reserved character and Xun's absolute sincerity, Margaret's straightforward manner came off as much more enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>It was also her fanatic temperament that made her so adorable, in his opinion. Zheng couldn't push her away, but only wrap his arms around her and hold her even tighter instead.</p>
