<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2686 Enthusiastic </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xun and Yudie looked at each other silently. Both of them were feeling a bit disappointed.</p>

  <p>Neither of the girls were unreasonable people. They hadn't been to the divine land yet, but had a good general understanding of the place.</p>

  <p>Since they had just recently become low-rank True Gods, it was still difficult for them to move around in a large region, not to mention to search for Luo Zheng in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Right then, an indifferent voice said, "I don't care how long you're going to wait! I'm leaving today! With or without you!"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin, dressed in blue, walked straight out of a door.</p>

  <p>Joy followed closely behind Xi Youqin. A helpless expression was etched on her delicate face.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, Xi Youqin had gradually become a mid-rank True God, and the process went off without a hitch.</p>

  <p>Joy had tried her best to cultivate Xi Youqin, very amazed with her great talent.</p>

  <p>As the Purple Soul Hall's founder, Joy recruited plenty of women who possessed the Purple Power Bodies. However, in all her time, she had never met such a talented disciple.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng was an exception among them all. He was different from other people.</p>

  <p>In Joy's eyes, Xi Youqin was like a piece of jade that Mike had carefully prepared for her. It had also been very interesting for Joy to train Xi Youqin in the Immortal Mansion over the past few years.</p>

  <p>She even believed that it wouldn't be long before Xi Youqin became a consummate True God. Joy had so much faith in Xi Youqin that she thought she might even become a Demi-holy Being in the future.</p>

  <p>The only problem was that Xi Youqin was extremely willful. Thus, Joy had to spend most of her time calming Xi Youqin down.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Augustus took a step forward and stood in front of Xi Youqin. His shadow completely covered her.</p>

  <p>He was tall, with a wicked smile on his face. "No one is stopping you.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion's gate is open. You can go anywhere you want!"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin looked up at Augustus and met his glare, her eyes fuming with rage.</p>

  <p>After having stayed in the Immortal Mansion for a short period of time, she began to regret it. She was always clamoring to leave to find Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It only happened once in the past that Augustus really allowed her to leave the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Despite that, she still couldn't find her way out of the large Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>The huge trees, tall grasses, streams, and rivers seemed to have grown their own feet. They changed positions at any given moment. From time to time, fierce giant apes would pass by, which scared Xi Youqin to death.</p>

  <p>Never had she expected that after running away, she would once again find herself at the gate of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Augustus had personally turned the place into a huge maze. He could change any route or path he desired, so how could Xi Youqin ever possibly escape?</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The purple internal momentum dispersed outward from Xi Youqin's body.</p>

  <p>Whiz!</p>

  <p>The four swords had besieged Augustus out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Annoyed, Xi Youqin employed the Gods Killing Sword Array and the Buddha Emperor Sword came slashing at Augustus's head at once.</p>

  <p>If a mid-rank True God was surrounded by the Gods Killing Sword Array, it would be difficult for them to escape. Even top-rank True Gods would be in a dangerous position.</p>

  <p>However, Augustus was a top consummate True God and he equally controlled the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was safe to say that Xi Youqin was no match for him.</p>

  <p>Facing the Buddha Emperor Sword, Augustus gently grasped it, immobilizing the sword completely with a single hand.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no way Xi Youqin was going to give up. In an instant, the Buddha Emperor Sword turned into a ball of purple light and escaped from his hand. Simultaneously, the other three swords began to move, slashing fatally forward.</p>

  <p>Despite its intensity, the others were used to this kind of scene, so they didn't have any reaction.</p>

  <p>And Joy was glad to see that they all kept their calm. In this case, there was a consummate True God who practiced the skill with Xi Youqin, which was clearly a good thing for her, to say the least.</p>

  <p>During the battle, a space fluctuation suddenly occurred at the front of the square, near the entrance of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Xun, Xi Youqin, and Yudie didn't take any notice. Their cultivation was still in a low level.</p>

  <p>But Joy, Saul and Hallet all looked toward the door at the exact same time.</p>

  <p>As for Augustus, he, of course, sensed that something was off. He was integrated as one with the entire Swirl Forest, and could notice everything happening there as soon as it occurred.</p>

  <p>The space fluctuation happened without the slightest warning. It seemed that someone had returned by activating the token of mountain.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>While Augustus was lost in thought, the Buddha Emperor Sword cracked him over the head.</p>

  <p>Although the Buddha Emperor Sword formed from the purple light was powerful, it couldn't cause damage to Augustus's physical body, because he was extremely tough. Under this strike, Augustus didn't suffer any damage, but the Buddha Emperor Sword turned into a cloud of purple light...</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin suddenly noticed that everyone was paying attention to the Immortal Mansion's entrance. She was slightly stunned and asked, "What's wrong? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>As she turned her head around, she saw Luo Zheng appear at the door, dressed in cyan.</p>

  <p>Ever since Xi Youqin entered the Immortal Mansion, any news she ever heard about Luo Zheng was bad. She had been worried about him, and she had reason for such.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, she remained confident in Luo Zheng the entire time.</p>

  <p>As long as she didn't see Luo Zheng's corpse, she wouldn't believe that he died!</p>

  <p>She would have to see it with her own eyes to believe it!</p>

  <p>"Honey!"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin was the first to rush over to the front door. As she moved, rays of purple light enveloped her body.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin slammed directly into Luo Zheng's open arms and tears began rolling down from her eyes, as if she had suffered a lot while staying in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>When the others noticed that Luo Zheng had returned, they had different expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Oh? In just ten years, your cultivation base has already reached the same level as mine. Ha-ha!" Augustus curled his lips and his face contorted into an expression of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Among the three disciples Bromley had accepted, Augustus always believed that he was the most talented. As a result, he wanted to teach Luo Zheng a hard lesson upon meeting him for the first time. He, on his behalf, wouldn't be nice like Hallet.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was also quite jealous of Luo Zheng's great talent. And more importantly, he was afraid that Luo Zheng would surpass him one day.</p>

  <p>That said, it seemed that he had no reason to be worried from now on.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had become a consummate True God over the last ten years, and he hadn't just surpassed Augustus.</p>

  <p>No one else could ever make that kind of progress, especially not that fast, during so many divine eras.</p>

  <p>When Harold, Hallet and Joy noticed Luo Zheng's cultivation base, they were also surprised. Their jaws dropped in awe.</p>

  <p>According to their conjecture, it wouldn't be easy for Luo Zheng to become a consummate True God. It was possible that he could succeed in a few hundred years or even a thousand years, while to the divine land, such a period of time was considered short.</p>

  <p>Where could Luo Zheng have been in the past ten years?</p>

  <p>If the rumors spreading from the Floating Islands were true, Luo Zheng had no chances of survival.</p>

  <p>Although Harold didn't say anything, he had suspected once before that Luo Zheng might have died under the Han Clan's ancestral land.</p>

  <p>For this reason, he had already secretly searched for one of Luo Zheng's substitutes, Nathan.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, they had many questions in their minds, but since Xi Youqin was hugging Luo Zheng like there was no one else around, it was improper for them to be disturbed right then.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt Xi Youqin, who he held tightly in his arms, tremble slightly. He could sense that she was truly excited...</p>

  <p>Compared to Yudie's reserved character and Xun's absolute sincerity, Xi Youqin's straightforward manner came off as much more enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>It was also her fanatic temperament that made her so adorable, in his opinion. Luo Zheng couldn't push her away, but only wrap his arms around her and hold her even tighter instead.</p>
