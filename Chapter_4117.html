  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan was confused after he heard what Divine Farmer said.</p>

  <p>When one obtained a bloodline, it would fully belong to them.</p>

  <p>On top of that, the more one used their obtained bloodline, the more powerful their token would be.</p>

  <p>That was how Xuanyuan thought the bloodlines worked ever since he became an Eternal Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit even told him the same thing before.</p>

  <p>But now that he knew about the existence of the Blood-controlling Method, he thought everything he knew came into question.</p>

  <p>"Master Eye Spirit didn't have the Blood-controlling Method before. It was given to him by a master," Divine Farmer told him.</p>

  <p>"A master..." Xuanyuan's eyes flashed with combined intrigue and surprise.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he was right in assuming that these Treacherous Beings were not as simple as they seemed.</p>

  <p>There was no way such powerful and terrible creatures came from within the chaos.</p>

  <p>Another matter to also consider was the relationship between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Treacherous Beings, but Xuanyuan pushed this to the back of his mind for the time being.</p>

  <p>"Can a master truly activate a stronger bloodline token with just a Blood-controlling Method?" he asked. Divine Farmer's words still made him doubtful.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer merely smiled in reply.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the blood within his body began to boil.</p>

  <p>His blood power used to be extremely fierce and violent but now, it was incredibly gentle.</p>

  <p>In just a few moments, a figure sporting a goat head with huge horns took shape.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer had just transformed into a goat monster! "What do you intend to do?"</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan immediately became alert.</p>

  <p>In this form, Divine Farmer's strength greatly increased but his consciousness was virtually non-existent. He essentially turned into a heartless goat monster.</p>

  <p>Was he perhaps planning to kill Xuanyuan?</p>

  <p>A powerful aura emanated from Divine Farmer's monster form, so powerful that it was enough to disrupt rubble on the ground.</p>

  <p>To Xuanyuan's surprise, Divine Farmer spoke, "I'm just trying to prove something to you."</p>

  <p>"Can you control your goat monster body?" Xuanyuan asked in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Completely," Divine Farmer replied. "I can freely choose and control any of the three forms of transformation."</p>

  <p>Back then, Divine Farmer's transformation forms came at random and, though they were powerful, there was always a risk that he did not get the one he wanted.</p>

  <p>"After cultivating the Blood-controlling Method, I was also able to obtain a fourth form. It consumes a lot of energy but its strength is far more complicated than that of the first three forms!" The elation in Divine Farmer's face was unmistakable as he made this declaration.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Xuanyuan remained doubtful.</p>

  <p>Could the Blood-controlling Method be truly so magical?</p>

  <p>There was only one way to find out. "Master Eye Spirit, will you impart such a wondrous method to me?" Xuanyuan asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>Before Divine Farmer could even open his mouth, his forehead suddenly split open to reveal an eyeball.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the Eye Spirit replied.</p>

  <p>"With the Blood-controlling Method, me and Divine Farmer will steadily grow in power." The Eye Spirit's words excited Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>All the regret and distress from the past few months completely disappeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The eyeball in the middle of Divine Farmer's forehead flickered and soon, numerous Sanskrit words floated in front of Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>"This is the Blood-controlling Method suitable for you. This battle is not related to the Li Shan mountain or the Finale Way. The only thing you have to do is to fight against the Black Ship," the Eye Spirit told him. "Don't let me down."</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan stared at all the Sanskrit words given to him with greed and desire.</p>

  <p>"Master Eye Spirit, may I ask a question?" he asked. "What is it?" the Eye Spirit replied.</p>

  <p>"The Blood-controlling Method is so powerful," Xuanyuan began.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not teach it to us in advance? We wouldn't have suffered so miserably in the battle of Li Shan mountain back then if you had taught us."</p>

  <p>"Well, we have just been taught, too."</p>

  <p>There was a hint of dissatisfaction in the Eye Spirit's tone.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization wholeheartedly served the Snake Spirit Sect but they were not always treated as amicably as they would like.</p>

  <p>To the Snake Masters, creatures of the chaos simply weren't qualified to learn nor had the ability to grasp the Blood-controlling Methods.</p>

  <p>Deeming his deed done, the eyeball disappeared, and the crack that appeared in the middle of Divine Farmer's forehead closed.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take to cultivate the Blood-controlling Method?" Xuanyuan asked Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>"Very soon, especially since we already have a good grasp on how to use our bloodline. It only took me four days to cultivate it," Divine Farmer answered.</p>

  <p>"Once I master the Blood-controlling Method, I will look for the Evil God!" Xuanyuan declared. This Blood-controlling Method gave hope to him.</p>

  <p>Up above the Roaring Lake Province, the aforementioned Evil God's body floated in the air like a leaf.</p>

  <p>"Wind..." he uttered as he closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was an image of tranquility as he floated by.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, a stronger wind blew and he found himself hurtling through the sky at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>"Strong wind..."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the strong wind turned into violent gales that swept through the entire Roaring Lake Province.</p>

  <p>The wind was strong enough to suck in the huge lakes and plow the ground into many ditches.</p>

  <p>It was a truly destructive storm.</p>

  <p>This wasn't the first time the Roaring Lake Province was devastated by such a violent shock wave.</p>

  <p>Numerous creatures that lived near the lakes now lay either dead or injured. Those who were lucky to survive moved around the Roaring Lake Province to try to stay far away from the danger.</p>

  <p>They couldn't leave the Roaring Lake Province entirely since it was their home.</p>

  <p>As the storm raged, no living being in the entire Roaring Lake Province could escape.</p>

  <p>Water and soil mixed together and formed a ten-thousand feet high pile of debris. Soon enough, the ground was squeezed all over again.</p>

  <p>Countless creatures lost their voice and died instantly.</p>

  <p>This would go on for an entire hour.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the winds finally calmed.</p>

  <p>From up above one would be able to see the extent of the damage: a graying brown mud plain wherein countless broken limbs lay.</p>

  <p>A large hole appeared in the middle of it all wherein a huge turtle shell surfaced from the hole. Underneath this shell were numerous creatures!</p>

  <p>One of the creatures it protected was at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>The sight of his race being exterminated broke this Chaotic Source Realm warrior's heart, and his Other Shore Token, the Sacred Earth Armor, could only save a few people.</p>

  <p>"You dodged my storm," the Evil God remarked with indifference as he floated down. "Your strength is not too shabby."</p>

  <p>To everyone's combined surprise and horror, the Evil God did not move his mouth. Rather his voice emanated from the earth itself.</p>

  <p>His words could be heard from within and across the Roaring Lake Province itself!</p>

  <p>It was like he suddenly became the land's ruler.</p>

  <p>Anger erupted from the Chaotic Source Realm warrior's eyes when he heard this.</p>

  <p>With the turtle shell on his head, he made a mad dash towards the Evil God and roared, "Why? Why did you destroy our Roaring Lake Province?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God simply raised his hand and the turtle shell atop the Chaotic Source Realm warrior's head shattered with a bang!</p>

  <p>"I want to correct your words," the Evil God told him. "This is not your Roaring Lake Province, but mine."</p>

  <p>"I'll kill you!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God's insensitive words pushed the Chaotic Source Realm warrior to the limit.</p>

  <p>He was determined to burn his Other Shore Token just to fight against this malicious character.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he soon discovered that even if he maxed out his potential, he still couldn't move.</p>

  <p>"It's not just the Roaring Lake Province," the Evil God began, "but everything in the Source World. The flowers, the trees, the buildings and even your lives all belong to me now. Everything is under my control and I can do everything that I want."</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Despite his best efforts to burn through his Other Shore Token, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior still turned into blood mist and completely disappeared from the world.</p>
