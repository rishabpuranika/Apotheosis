<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2963 The Sky Rending Rhinoceros </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship was an exquisitely designed structure. Seen from the outside, it seemed to have a small interior space, but it actually had a larger space inside.</p>

  <p>The flying ship was trembling violently as it was traveling at a fast speed, but everyone was able to maintain their balance and keep standing.</p>

  <p>Emily squinted her eyes and directed her gaze to where Zheng had pointed.</p>

  <p>"It's a space cave..."</p>

  <p>"Is that what a space cave looks like?" There was a subtle change on Leopold's expression. He knew about the existence of space caves from stories he had heard, but this was the first time he saw one for himself.</p>

  <p>Yan put her hand on Zheng's shoulder and asked, "What is a space cave?"</p>

  <p>Emily was the one who replied. She blinked her eyes and said, "The Sky Rending Rhinoceros is one of the top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos. It leaves behind a space cave after it travels through space!"</p>

  <p>"The top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos?" Zheng narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Emily nodded her head in confirmation and explained, "They are ferocious beasts that wander outside the Source World. They usually hide in the deepest parts of the chaos and very rarely get close to the Source World.</p>

  <p>But every time they appear, they can't help but cause a huge commotion.</p>

  <p>Only the top masters in the Source World can fight against them..."</p>

  <p>"Then will there be any danger in a space cave?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Emily shook her head. "The space cave itself is not dangerous. The Sky Rending Rhinoceros is proficient in the Space Law. It doesn't need to use techniques like the Grand Teleportation when it travels through the chaos."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't rely on the Grand Teleportation technique?" Zheng asked in clarification, as he was surprised by this information.</p>

  <p>Actually, people utilized the Grand Teleportation technique to create a space channel for travelling. The deeper their comprehension of the space, the more stable the space channel.</p>

  <p>For example, Emily created a space channel that was ten million miles long, but she only needed to take a single step forward to emerge from the other end of the space channel. On the other hand, the Holy Beings could also create a space channel ten million miles in length, but they were required to travel through the space channel for a period of time before they walked out of the other end of the channel.</p>

  <p>"In the simplest terms, the Grand Teleportation technique is a skill that relies on one's understanding of the Space Law. However, the Sky Rending Rhinoceros can make an opening in one space and connect it to another located anywhere in the chaos," Emily said while she stared at the black hole. "The opening in space created by the Sky Rending Rhinoceros is what we call a space cave."</p>

  <p>"Then, if we were to pass through this space cave, will we end up in another place in the chaos?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the space cave itself poses no danger to us.</p>

  <p>It's what we might find on the other side of the space cave that worries me..." said Emily.</p>

  <p>After he had heard Emily's explanation, Zheng's fears were lessened. He confidently smiled and told the others, "Since the space cave is only a passage that travels through the chaos, there shouldn't be any danger. We might even be lucky and enter the Source World in advance using this passage."</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng had already said so, Emily, Leopold, and the other members of the Snake Goddess race still weren't reassured.</p>

  <p>"The chaos might be mostly empty and vast, but it also has all sorts of unknown and dangerous lands. What if the other end of the space cave connects to the Ruin Graveyard or the Death Land? All of us will perish then."</p>

  <p>The chaos only seemed to be empty due to its sheer immense size.</p>

  <p>In fact, there were so many unexplored areas that existed within the chaos, like the Ruin Graveyard and the Death Land which Leopold had already mentioned. These dangerous places were infamous in the Source World as everyone knew how perilous they were, yet no one had really seen their internal features because no one had returned from them alive.</p>

  <p>Upon learning the fate that might await them, Yan wasn't able to prevent herself from grasping Zheng's arm, a faint nervous expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, Yan. We can't be that unlucky to end up on such damned places," Zheng tried to console her with a smile.</p>

  <p>Emily saw Yan's nervous expression; she also tried to soothe her, "Don't listen to Leopold's nonsense. We won't be so unlucky."</p>

  <p>"You're right!" Yan's eyelids flickered slightly, as she tried hard to be courageous. She smiled and said, "I'm not afraid of anything as long as Zheng is with me."</p>

  <p>While their discussions were ongoing, they hadn't noticed that the Trumpet Flying Ship was shaking more and more violently.</p>

  <p>Leopold was no longer directly controlling the plate. He just let the force of the space cave pull the Trumpet Flying Ship into it. The ship flew along the chaotic blue lines, swayed, and was entirely sucked into the space cave.</p>

  <p>Darkness engulfed everything from the moment the flying ship entered the space cave.</p>

  <p>Firefly stones were embedded into the rails of the Trumpet Flying Ship, but no light from the firefly stones penetrated into the pitch-black darkness.</p>

  <p>An eerie howling sound came from the deep darkness.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the wind that howled, but it sounded more like a huge creature moving through space.</p>

  <p>"Whooshing... Hoo... Whooshing... Hoo!"</p>

  <p>The howling sounded like it came from an area far away from them, but from time to time, the party heard it rattling in their ears.</p>

  <p>Everyone bated their breaths, no one dared to utter a single word.</p>

  <p>Emily had provided an explanation regarding the existence of the space cave, but all of her knowledge had been gained from reading books. She had never entered one personally, so she had no way to verify if the records were true. The weird sound made them think of things that did not bode well for them.</p>

  <p>Yan said she was not afraid, but her body language showed otherwise. Her hands clutched Zheng tightly, her slightly trembling body curled up beside him.</p>

  <p>In the past, she had been trained under Harold's protection in the Everest Spirit Mountain. The only adventure she had was the one at the bottom of the Sunrest Tree. At that time, Yan had great advantage in her strength; and with Zheng's protection, she had not been afraid of anything.</p>

  <p>After she had been reunited with her parents and brother, Yan had experienced immense joy and she had wished that this kind of life could go on forever.</p>

  <p>However, things did not go as well as she had hoped. She had been forced to step on the journey, and there had been an unknown fear that was weighing on her mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt the emotion behind Yan's actions, and he formed an apology for her in his heart.</p>

  <p>Her mother had given Yan the choice, but as a sensible girl, she did not have the heart to reject her parents.</p>

  <p>Sending her on the journey to the Pear Hill might have been a mistake.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. It won't take long," Zheng whispered to his younger sister.</p>

  <p>He felt pity for Yan, but he could only caress her silky hair; he thought that after emerging into the other side of the space cave, he could place Yan into Emily's inner world so that she wouldn't be so afraid.</p>

  <p>After they had been traveling in the darkness for several minutes, Zheng felt more and more confused.</p>

  <p>This space cave could fold the space in between two places, so naturally, it should have made use of the Space Law. However, in this dark space, he hadn't been able to sense even a single trace of the Space Law Power. Zheng was puzzled as to how the Sky Rending Rhinoceros did it.</p>

  <p>While he was deep in thought, Zheng thought he had seen a glimmer of light in his peripheral vision. He instinctively looked for the source of light, and his eyes narrowed. He covered Yan's eyes with his hands.</p>

  <p>Leopold, Emily, and the masters at the Other Shore Realm were all stunned into a silent panic.</p>

  <p>A gigantic ferocious beast head was directly in front of the Trumpet Flying Ship, and the light shone from its eyes!</p>

  <p>"Oh, crap! This is probably the worst possible situation," Emily cursed in frustration, and her heart sank in despair.</p>
