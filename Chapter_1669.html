<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the sacred place was overjoyed when Tianming made it into the top ten thousand.</p>

  <p>As a great power of the human race, the Thoughtless Minds was actually four large divine kingdoms, and the four great clans acted as its emperors.</p>

  <p>The sacred places under its command were considered to be subjects of the four clans. The Thoughtless Minds was completely different from the Humanity Alliance in terms of structure.</p>

  <p>And because of this, the four great clans would be given all the resources and they would then allocate these resources.</p>

  <p>The fact that this tenth-grade sacred place had cultivated a talent who was now in the top ten thousand was completely beyond the Saint Lord's expectations. He would be able to take advantage of this fact to obtain more resources and rewards from the four great clans.</p>

  <p>But they had never expected Tianming to improve his ranking once he became one of the top ten thousand warriors.</p>

  <p>He had succeeded in entering the second stage.</p>

  <p>And then, at last, he entered the final stage, becoming one of the participants battling on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>This brought joy to many warriors of the tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>It even attracted the attention of the Saint Lords of two other tenth-grade sacred places.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that the black stone under Tianming's feet had not been moved onto the board yet. This made them increasingly anxious and they wanted now more than ever to watch him battle.</p>

  <p>What they hadn't expected was that Tianming would get onto the board at this critical moment. If he was defeated at this time, he would be eliminated immediately.</p>

  <p>They had also not expected that Xenia would be Tianming's opponent!</p>

  <p>Xenia was the star of the Celestial Position, born within thunder and lightning.</p>

  <p>All of the ace talents present were legendary figures.</p>

  <p>And Xenia's background was especially exceptionally miraculous.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Thunder World, one of the many worlds in the universe, was filled with a violent power of thunder.</p>

  <p>And no one had set foot there in all these years.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because they were afraid of the thunder. In fact, the more strange and dangerous a place was, the more likely one would get a great opportunity. There were often countless warriors who went to such places to find opportunities and train to become stronger.</p>

  <p>The Divine Flame World was one of such places. This world was not suitable for living, but many warriors would risk their lives to enter it and obtain secret treasures.</p>

  <p>The risks were often proportional to returns.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Thunder World, on the other hand, was special because of the fact that a Mysterious Thunder Beast was sealed within it.</p>

  <p>It was said that about eighty million years ago, six Supreme Lords had joined forces to seal this Mysterious Thunder Beast in, relying on a Supreme Lord's Heavenly Destiny— the Heavenly Destiny of Sealing.</p>

  <p>It was precisely because of the existence of this seal that no one could now get into the Mysterious Thunder World.</p>

  <p>But the seal had been broken twenty-two years ago.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destiny of Sealing was usually arranged based on the heavens' rules. In theory, this seal was the strongest in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>The shattering of it meant that the Mysterious Thunder Beast had broken free from the seal and had obtained a power surpassing the heavens.</p>

  <p>Every being in the universe had been shocked at this development.</p>

  <p>Many warriors had even cried out in alarm, believing that the crisis of the world of chaos had arrived ahead of time.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Thunder Beast was the crisis and it quickly gained the attention of many races in the universe.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the human race, the Celestial Position race, and the ogre race went to the Mysterious Thunder World to check on the situation.</p>

  <p>However, they found something unexpected once they had checked repeatedly.</p>

  <p>The seal of the Mysterious Thunder World had indeed been broken.</p>

  <p>But the Mysterious Thunder Beast was still sealed within it. Only a small portion of the seal was destroyed–so small that it could be ignored.</p>

  <p>And as they continued their investigation, they discovered something astonishing.</p>

  <p>This seal had been broken by a three-year-old girl!</p>

  <p>This little girl had actually broken the seal on her own, and had walked out of that damned place with all sorts of Thunder Laws.</p>

  <p>This girl was Xenia Luo.</p>

  <p>Many races began to fight for her once they realized that she was supernormal.</p>

  <p>In the end, she had been taken away by the members of the Celestial Position, who named her Xenia Luo.</p>

  <p>Her origins were magical, which sparked heated discussions in the universe. But everyone eventually stopped discussing her.</p>

  <p>It was because once she had joined the Celestial Position, there was no more news of her.</p>

  <p>But the year before the Illusion Battlefield had opened, the Celestial Position had declared that they already had two Godly Geniuses: Karl Jiang and Xenia Luo.</p>

  <p>Although no one had ever seen the extent of Xenia's power, everyone still believed that she was qualified to be a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>They knew that there would always be warriors in this world who were born remarkable.</p>

  <p>Xenia was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! The first opponent that Tianming will have to face is Xenia from the Celestial Position!"</p>

  <p>"Rumor has it that Xenia is extremely powerful, but she might not be able to defeat Tianming."</p>

  <p>"Well, any talent belonging to the Celestial Position would be capable of being a top disciple of our sacred place. Besides, Xenia is a Godly Genius of the Celestial Position, the most powerful one among the young warriors. So how could she possibly be weak?"</p>

  <p>Many warriors in the tenth-grade sacred place couldn't help but sigh.</p>

  <p>Now that Tianming had made it into the top three hundred, the next thing that he could do and that would be great was if he made it into the top ten and obtained a Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>It was a pity he had to battle Xenia. Why was he so unlucky?</p>

  <p>Xenia jumped off the stone and glanced at the board beneath her feet.</p>

  <p>Her purple eyes then shifted to Tianming's handsome face, before she smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm Xenia Luo of the Celestial Position," she said.</p>

  <p>Xenia didn't look special in this moment. Instead, she looked like a friendly mortal with an elegant Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Tianming also stepped off his black stone and pulled the long sword off his back.</p>

  <p>The long sword was wrapped in a layer of sackcloth. He placed it on the ground and slowly unwrapped it.</p>

  <p>Some warriors would take advantage of this and attack.</p>

  <p>But Xenia would not do that.</p>

  <p>Tianming also knew that she wouldn't.</p>

  <p>Once Tianming had removed the cloth, the sword's hilt came into view. It seemed to be a very ordinary sword. The body of the sword was still hidden in the scabbard, and he did not pull it out.</p>

  <p>Tianming stood up, holding on to the hilt. "I'm Hua Tianming of Cloud Hall," he said.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" Xenia said, tilting her head as she looked at him rather doubtfully.</p>

  <p>What the hell was Cloud Hall?</p>

  <p>Preston, from the Pure Jade Sacred Place, stared at Ning Yudie. Tianming's words proved Ning Yudie to be right.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie only smiled, and seemed to take it as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>Ever since Tianming had shown his prowess during his fight with the Heavenly Evil Sect, the Cloud Hall had begun to attach importance to him.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie naturally understood his personality. As a swordsman, he was a principled warrior. He had never separated from the Cloud Hall, and had always been a member of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had secretly observed Tianming back then. If there weren't any big surprises, he would be promoted to the position of hall leader once his cultivation base was high enough.</p>

  <p>But Tianming's ambitions were not limited to the Cloud Hall or even the Central Region. He had even greater ambitions.</p>

  <p>Tianming had disappeared since he had left the Central Region. It was only after Ning Yudie had flown into the Upper World that she came to know that Tianming had actually ascended to the Upper World, and that he possessed such powerful strength.</p>

  <p>At Tianming's reply, the warriors of the tenth-grade sacred place of the Thoughtless Minds erupted into a discontented chaos.</p>

  <p>But their dissatisfaction wasn't of great importance. The help they had extended to Tianming hadn't been great. They had just let him use their ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>Tianming ignored Xenia's confused gaze.</p>

  <p>With one hand on the scabbard, he slowly drew the sword out, revealing the snow-white blade.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to use this sword to fight you," he said. Tianming then stopped unsheathing his sword before smiling. "If you have the strength, you can force me to unsheathe my sword to resist you."</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>

  <p>Judging from his words, Tianming didn't plan on drawing his sword even while fighting Xenia.</p>

  <p>He proved it by sliding the sword back into the scabbard.</p>

  <p>But he was facing a Godly Genius, not an ordinary warrior! And Xenia was the Godly Genius of the Celestial Position!</p>

  <p>"Why is this guy so confident and how does he dare say those words to Xenia?"</p>

  <p>"What on earth is the Cloud Hall? What kind of a force is it? There seems to be no such force in the universe!"</p>

  <p>"This fellow will be in great trouble. I'm afraid that Xenia will torture him to death!"</p>

  <p>Every warrior in the universe who was witnessing this scene thought Tianming to be crazy.</p>
