<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Thick smoke billowed in the air as the black warship stopped in front of Zheng. A Sacred warrior stood at the ship's bow.</p>

  <p>The warrior was only at the Spirit Transformation Realm, but he appeared intimidating as he looked arrogantly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The ship's hull shook a little bit before it came to a complete halt. "Hey, did you come to our Sacred race's territory to surrender?" the Sacred warrior stared at Zheng and asked.</p>

  <p>The only reason the Sacred warrior even bothered to ask was because Zheng had a cultivation level of a world lord. Had he been a martial artist at the Soul Sea Realm, Spirit Supreme Realm, Spirit Transformation or even Life and Death Realm, the Sacred warrior would've killed him immediately. A creature from the Evolutionary Universe was no different from a pig or a dog in the eyes of the Sacred warriors.</p>

  <p>'They are really the Sacred warriors….' Zheng thought. His eyes narrowed into slits as he scanned the Sacred warrior from head to toe. There also seemed to be some information to be gleaned from the Sacred warrior's words.</p>

  <p>He said "Sacred race's territory," which meant that this supreme world had already been occupied by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Surrender...</p>

  <p>It meant that there were world lords in the human race who became traitors.</p>

  <p>The human race had always had its fair share of traitors ever since the ancient times. Thus, it didn't come as a surprise when some martial artists surrendered to the Sacred race in order to survive.</p>

  <p>"Do you come for the sake of surrender!" the Sacred warrior asked again. At the same time, the other Sacred martial artists became more vigilant.</p>

  <p>If this guy did not come to surrender, they might have to be ready to fight.</p>

  <p>Even then, the Sacred warriors already were quite confident in their strengths. Moreover, the seven Sacred warriors present were all top-level Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists. They already had an established set of tactics, which they had long perfected. It wouldn't be a problem for them to defeat a world lord with joint efforts.</p>

  <p>Lastly, this place wasn't far from their supreme headquarters. If they couldn't defeat the man in front of them, it wouldn't be hard for them to escape from Zheng's clutches.</p>

  <p>A faint smile lit up Zheng's face as he floated into the air. Then, he slowly moved towards the black warship in the sky and said, "If I intend to surrender, would the Sacred race accept me?"</p>

  <p>The Sacred warrior's eyes lit up immediately upon hearing Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Supreme Lords and the True Gods at the top were those who decided the result of the war.</p>

  <p>However, it did not mean that the lower level martial artists were automatically useless.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race would need a large number of world lords to gradually stabilize the supreme worlds they had occupied if they wanted to control the entire Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe was far too vast. It was about the same size as the entire Sacred race, and that was with its power not included. Thus, it would be quite difficult for the Sacred race to take over the whole Evolutionary Universe on their own.</p>

  <p>It all boiled down to not having enough manpower.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had occupied twelve supreme worlds this month, but they had failed to send enough forces to guard those territories. What would most likely happen was in the next month, the human race would avoid the Sacred race's main forces and seize back about ten of the occupied supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>The war was like two different hands that constantly pulled at a saw.</p>

  <p>When one side won, the other immediately fought back and turned the table. Such repetitiveness annoyed the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Sacred race had dispatched more warriors from the Murphy Universe, then offered amnesty and enlistment to the human martial artists. It was a part of their plan to use the influence of the human world lords who had joined them to consolidate the supreme worlds they had occupied.</p>

  <p>In addition, a reward awaited the Sacred squad that would successfully recruit a human world lord.</p>

  <p>"The man who can recognize the facts of a situation is a paragon of men.</p>

  <p>Our Sacred race will eventually become the master of this universe. If you can abandon your race and become a member of our Sacred race, then of course we will welcome you," the Sacred martial artist said in a friendly tone and smiled.</p>

  <p>It was said that not only would the humans who would join the Sacred race be treated well, they could even become small leaders of the Sacred race!</p>

  <p>Powerful warriors were wanted everywhere, especially in a time of war between the two universes. While both sides had more than hundreds of thousands of world lords, the number of warriors below their level was in trillions.</p>

  <p>But what was important was for the Sacred race to successfully implant the Heart-devouring Bug inside the human warriors who had joined the Sacred race. That way, the Sacred race wouldn't have to worry about the humans betraying them. If they did, they would only die a miserable death.</p>

  <p>The several Sacred martial artists were surely certain that this world lord in front them had betrayed his race. If they could bring him back, they would receive a generous reward.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Zheng continued to ask, "What if I didn't come here to surrender?"</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artist's faux friendly demeanor immediately wore off.</p>

  <p>His smiling eyes flashed coldly as he said, "Are you kidding? If you enter this place but have no wish to join our Sacred race, you are courting death."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right. I indeed came here to court death."</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng finished speaking, his figure moved in a flash and he stood in front of the Sacred warriors. A slight crack was heard as Zheng's fist collided with their bodies.</p>

  <p>While Zheng's powerful punch wasn't the one to be underestimated, the Sacred martial artists were extremely quick to react as well. The seven Sacred martial artists' agile bodies immediately dispersed as Zheng's punch came at them.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was an earth shattering rumble before the black warship broke into pieces and turned into scraps and fragments that fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>Just then, the seven Sacred warriors had already formed a circle and trapped Zheng inside!</p>

  <p>"Attack!"</p>

  <p>No one could deny that the Sacred martial artists were of truly higher caliber than those martial artists from the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>There were a few reasons as to why was such a case.</p>

  <p>The Murphy Universe was a normal universe which did not have concepts like the grand era. It was because the universe's creator, Murphy, wasn't like Mike who kept holding on to his last breath of life.</p>

  <p>Mike had to destroy the heavens and build it over and over again to prevent the life vitality in the universe from being completely drained.</p>

  <p>That way, he could maintain the flow of life vitality in the universe and maintain the activities of the Evolutionary Universe at the same time.</p>

  <p>However, the problem was that the destruction of a universe usually came along with the end of a grand era--which resulted in the loss of some ancient legacies in the universe that couldn't be passed on to the next generations. It was why the universe had to restart every 3.6 billion years.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Murphy Universe did not have such problems. Its development was consistent and its next generations were able to inherit many legacies, plenty of which were from the time of the universe's creation. So the comprehension of rules and the entire universe's development were far superior to that of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, martial artists in the Murphy Universe were usually more powerful than their counterparts in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>It was also the reason the seven Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists didn't run away when they were faced with a world lord. On the contrary, they even dared to surround and attack Zheng. They believed that as long as they cooperated well, they could kill this world lord.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, an ordinary world lord wouldn't stand a chance against these seven Sacred warriors.</p>

  <p>However, they had encountered Zheng, who was grown from a seed which was nurtured with Holy Mike's great dedication.</p>

  <p>Not only did this seed carry the fate of saving the Evolutionary Universe, he was also tasked to stir a pool of dead water in the divine land and carry out an outrageous plan of Mike!</p>

  <p>Heavy boots set off into the air as three of the Sacred martial artists attacked Zheng at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Primordial Inner Demon!" they shouted in unison.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the eyes of the three Sacred martial artists darkened, and they let out a blood-curdling noise. Their bodies emitted a demonic aura that directly struck Zheng's soul and began to disturb his mind.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was the most powerful force in the Murphy Universe, which was known for its orderliness. This trait was demonstrated in their methods of training their warriors to coordinate with each other and form strong teams instead of fighting as an individual.</p>

  <p>While there were many powers and races in the Evolutionary Universe, most martial artists fought on their own. Even if some forces managed to develop some joint attack techniques, such things became useless when they reached the Spirit Transformation Realm, or the level of a world lord.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that the martial artists of the Evolutionary Universe were like a heap of loose sand, lacking spirit of cooperation.</p>

  <p>The heavy gazes of the three Sacred warriors began to make Zheng feel upset, and the negative emotions in his heart began to stir.</p>

  <p>However, this disturbance of mind only lasted for a blink of an eye before a faint smile appeared again on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Zheng had entered the Mind Refining Tower after he left the Soul Suppressing Cliff. He had suffered all sorts of torment from inner demons in all the seventy-seven floors of the tower. The mind-disturbing technique the three Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists in front of him had exerted on him was only equivalent to the inner demon on the thirtieth floor of the Mind Refining Tower, which failed to shake his state of mind.</p>

  <p>"It's a shame that you... only have this little bit of ability."</p>

  <p>He then took a step forward, and left no room for his opponents to escape. He gently brushed a slender but powerful index finger against the forehead of one Sacred martial artist.</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artist's eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>His entire body became slack before he fell down the sky. His resentful eyes never left Zheng until he finally crashed on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artist's skull was completely shattered with just a light brush of Zheng's finger. The power of Zheng's attack had stirred his mind into a completely mess. His soul was broken into pieces and quickly vanished into thin air.</p>
