<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3828 Imprint Transmission Tower </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Da, Da, Da..."</p>

  <p>The Void Sand occasionally hit their bodies, and the pain felt like needles pricking their skin.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that it was both physical and mental pain.</p>

  <p>It was especially hard for the warrior of the Life race on the left since he was highly sensitive to pain. Every time a grain of sand hit him, he gritted his teeth and groaned in agony.</p>

  <p>It also hurt both Egan and Kirk, but they endured it a lot better. They only frowned and simply put up with it.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the sand wouldn't quickly erode Zheng's body, but he couldn't just get rid of the pain in his soul.</p>

  <p>After they moved forward for a certain distance, a square appeared on the scroll painting. There was a big hexagram array drawn at the entrance of the square.</p>

  <p>Their group of nine entered the hexagram array and returned to their normal state. At that moment, a circular tower appeared in the center of the square.</p>

  <p>The tower looked only like a simple circle on the scroll painting, but it looked magnificent and lofty in the square.</p>

  <p>"This is the Imprint Transmission Tower," said Egan as he turned to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This is the starting point that leads to the big vortex. If you got some imprints while you were in the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, you can get the corresponding protection from the Imprint Transmission Tower."</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that it was nice of Egan to explain everything to him in detail, as Egan knew that it was his first time to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>Although the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already told him about it, he still listened carefully, as Egan explained.</p>

  <p>In general, ordinary Other Shore creatures weren't resistant to the Void Sand's erosion. It was perfectly fine for them to be in the sixteen outer circles since there was not much Void Sand there. However, there was a massive amount of Void Sand in the deep part of the vortex, and those grains of sand could easily erode them. If they wanted to travel smoothly in the depths of the vortex, they had to rely on the Imprint Transmission Tower.</p>

  <p>In front of the tower was a member of the Jade Crown race who took the lead to step forward.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>When the warrior approached the Imprint Transmission Tower, his chest, back, and head began to glow. In turn, seven imprints appeared on the tower.</p>

  <p>"Three Bone Tribulation Imprints and four Holy Soul Imprints, that's not bad," said Egan.</p>

  <p>The three Bone Tribulation Imprints were exposed, so everyone saw them.</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Imprints were on one's soul, and they were invisible to the naked eye but easy to figure out.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The imprints on the Imprint Transmission Tower only remained for a short while before they disappeared. Then, a golden light came down from the tower and enveloped the warrior of the Jade Crown race.</p>

  <p>"Now he should be able to reach the ninth circle from the center since seven layers of imprint light protected his body. But I can't say for sure if he could do better than that," Kirk commented.</p>

  <p>"If he has stronger willpower and a faster speed, maybe he could break into the eighth circle," said Egan with a smile.</p>

  <p>Egan had nine imprints, which made him an outstanding warrior. His goal was to rush into the fifth circle. He felt a sense of superiority when he saw the seven imprints of the warrior from the Jade Crown race.</p>

  <p>After the warrior of the Jade Crown race obtained the protective light, he retreated to the side.</p>

  <p>The next one who entered was the warrior of the Life race.</p>

  <p>As soon as he neared the Imprint Transmission Tower, four imprints flashed across his body, and eight imprints on the tower lit up. It meant that he had four Holy Soul Imprints, and four Bone Tribulation Imprints, respectively.</p>

  <p>The warrior felt very proud. He turned his head and announced, "My goal is to enter the seventh circle!"</p>

  <p>It was difficult for a warrior who had eight imprints to enter the seventh circle, but it was clear that this warrior was determined.</p>

  <p>Next, Egan and Kirk approached the Imprint Transmission Tower and obtained their protective light.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the more imprints one had, the stronger the protective light the Imprint Transmission Tower gave them.</p>

  <p>For example, the protective light Egan acquired was much denser than that of the warrior from the Jade Crown race.</p>

  <p>After nearly all of them received the protective light, only Zheng and a member of the Grasshopper race were left. The warrior from the Grasshopper race wasn't tall and remained quiet throughout, and most people ignored him.</p>

  <p>"It's your turn, Zheng," Egan said with a smile.</p>

  <p>He had nine imprints, so he was the one with the most imprints among the group. He wanted to see how many imprints Zheng had, and the Other Shore creatures were curious about it as well.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had shown great strength, it didn't necessarily mean that he had a lot of imprints.</p>

  <p>However, the warrior from the Grasshopper race suddenly walked towards the Imprint Transmission Tower.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Just as he approached the Imprint Transmission Tower, the imprints on his body lit up. Thirteen imprints appeared on the Imprint Transmission Tower.</p>

  <p>"My goal is to enter the inner circles," he declared.</p>

  <p>The inner circles were the four circles near the center, and the bloodline they could get from there was much stronger than that in the outer circles.</p>

  <p>That was also the root-level bloodline the fox girl had mentioned before!</p>

  <p>Thirteen imprints were extremely rare, so he was indeed qualified to break through to the inner circles.</p>

  <p>"The Earth Grasshopper of the Grasshopper race actually has thirteen imprints!"</p>

  <p>"A wise head truly makes a closed mouth. I didn't expect that he had so many imprints!"</p>

  <p>"Break through to the inner circles... After we reach the Eternal Realm, he would still be more powerful than us."</p>

  <p>Some of them were envious, but there was nothing they could do. After all, some things had already been decided when they passed the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Although the number of imprints did not mean everything, some special abilities and willpower could fill the gap. But except for a small number of extremely powerful people who could narrow the gap, the others wouldn't be able to do much.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A dazzling beam of protective light appeared around the warrior of the Grasshopper race. The light he released was much more intense than that of Egan, and it was the brightest of all.</p>

  <p>Now, only Zheng was left.</p>

  <p>"The strongest one among us should be the Earth Grasshopper."</p>

  <p>"Yes, thirteen imprints. No one had achieved such an extraordinary feat in a long time..."</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>The performance of the warrior from the Grasshopper race caught everyone's attention, so they expected a bit less from Zheng's performance.</p>

  <p>After all, it was hard for him to surpass thirteen imprints.</p>

  <p>After the warrior of the Grasshopper race left the Imprint Transmission Power, Zheng walked towards it.</p>

  <p>The moment he neared it, his chest, legs, back, arms, head?</p>

  <p>All of his body parts glowed with the imprints' light, and so did the tower.</p>

  <p>Nine Bone Tribulation Imprints of different shapes and nine Holy Soul Imprints appeared on the tower at the same time.</p>

  <p>The ray of light was somewhat blinding, and the crowd in the square fell silent. It wasn't until quite a while later that they began to roar.</p>

  <p>"How many imprints are there?"</p>

  <p>"One, two, three... Eighteen, eighteen imprints... "</p>

  <p>"Eighteen imprints? Has he achieved complete success in both the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation?"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures present grew up on the Grand Plain Stage, so they had watched the Eternal Scroll Painting unfold over and over again.</p>

  <p>They were familiar with all sorts of stories about talents, but they had never heard of anyone who had obtained eighteen imprints! "Zheng, it this real?"</p>

  <p>Kirk asked in shock.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe his eyes!</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng just shrugged slightly at Kirk's disbelief. "Zheng, are you going to break through to the first circle?" Egan asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll try my best," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>The bloodline power in the innermost circle was only at the root level. It naturally didn't meet the requirements of the fox girl, so he could only try his best to explore the vortex and reach the end.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>After the eighteen imprints disappeared, the protective light appeared on his body. The layer of protective light was as thick as real armor, and it tightly wrapped around him.</p>
