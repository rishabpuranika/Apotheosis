<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fenton was holding a jade sword in his hand and floating around quietly.</p>

  <p>He looked calm and peaceful.</p>

  <p>"I could have rejected the proposal of the Saint Lord," he suddenly remarked in a mysterious voice, playing with the jade sword casually.</p>

  <p>"Truth is, I am challenging you not only to fulfill the Saint Lord's wishes, but also to prove a point to the thirteen palaces of the alliance."</p>

  <p>"And what might that point be?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I want to prove to them that their choice is wrong," Fenton answered.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that, Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and told his opponent, "Then come! Prove it!" He raised his long sword in front of his chest. This was a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>"A sacred weapon?" Fenton was surprised when he saw that.</p>

  <p>"Yes. So what?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Actually, it is understandable. You've just ascended and therefore, I don't find it strange that you don't have a divine weapon,"</p>

  <p>Fenton shrugged his shoulders. Unexpectedly, he then sheathed his dark red jade sword and took out a light green one instead. "I have two swords. The crimson one is a secondary first-rank divine weapon called the State Sword. I would have used that against you but it would spoil my reputation if I did. The green one in my hand is a secondary third-rank divine weapon. It is only one grade above yours. I know that it would still be a little unfair to you, but I don't have any sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>So I'm sorry." Fenton genuinely seemed like a warrior who followed fair play rules.</p>

  <p>"A secondary third-rank divine weapon? And a secondary first-rank divine weapon?" Luo Luo Zheng was confused when he heard that.</p>

  <p>The warriors from the Myriad Spiritual Force House all laughed when they saw his face. Through a Picture Slab in the Dragon Tiger Hall, they could view the entire Illusion Space, and at the same time, the sound from this world was also transmitted to them. They could know everything that was going on here.</p>

  <p>"I told you that anyone who comes from the Lower World is a bumpkin.</p>

  <p>Hah!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe this guy has never even seen a divine weapon."</p>

  <p>"That's a real possibility and it would be a hoot! In the Lower World, it's very difficult for a weapon refiner to refine a divine weapon."</p>

  <p>They were all wrong. In fact, Luo Luo Zheng had seen many divine weapons in his life than they would have expected.</p>

  <p>However, he had never studied the grades of the divine weapons. He had always thought that the divine weapons, much like the sacred weapons, were also divided into three grades: top, middle and low.</p>

  <p>But judging by Fenton's words, that was not the case.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the lowest grade of the divine weapons was the secondary third-rank. It was one level stronger than a top-grade sacred weapon, which was called a semi-divine weapon in the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>From then on, they went all the way from third rank to secondary second rank, second rank, secondary first rank and first rank, with each one better than the last one. At the top of them all was the supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Fenton's dark red State Sword was a secondary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Which meant that it was quite a formidable sword. However, the most powerful weapons in the universe were the ones which were listed on the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>The Universe Spirit Tablet was ranked by some three thousand supreme divine weapons that adorned its top. Only after that came the first-rank divine weapons, which went all the way till ten thousandth.</p>

  <p>When Fenton came to know that Luo Luo Zheng didn't know the classification of weapons in the Upper World, he even explained it to Luo Luo Zheng. He seemed like quite a charmer if it weren't for the fact that he was going to fight Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did have a supreme divine weapon --- the Black Star pickax, but it was not so appropriate for combat situations. Moreover, this was the Upper World. He might not be strong enough to protect his weapons now. Therefore, it was better if he hid his Black Star pickax from prying eyes of some super strong warriors.</p>

  <p>'We have talked too much. It's time to fight," Fenton smiled and began to motivate his martial arts skill.</p>

  <p>"The Wind Law, at the fourth-layer." Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed as he appraised his opponent's skill.</p>

  <p>"You are right. It's a pity that my affinity of the Space Law is not that good. I would have loved to use that." All of a sudden, his figure vanished even before his words had ended.</p>

  <p>Faced with an invisible enemy, Luo Luo Zheng released his sense to perceive the surroundings. "Everyone's affinity to the Law Power is different.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't it be better for you to practice the law that you are good at?" He also asked the thin air around him.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand." A voice drifted over from all around, "The Space Law and the Time Law are two of the most fundamental skills in the Upper World. You can ignore the other laws, but it is necessary to practice these two Laws."</p>

  <p>Along with the voice, a fierce wind also blew over towards Luo Luo Zheng. At the same time, a light green sword stabbed out from within it secretly.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't fast enough.</p>

  <p>"Clang!" Two swords collided.</p>

  <p>"Your reaction is quite quick!" Fenton praised his opponent and vanished into the wind again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still persisted with his questions, "Tell me. Why does a warrior in the Upper World have to practice the Time Law and the Space Law?</p>

  <p>What's so important about them?"</p>

  <p>"Well. I've only comprehended one layer of the Time Law and two layers of the Space Law. And I am quite distressed about this incompetence. Be careful! It won't be easy to dodge me this time." With that, the wind blew again, and it was fiercer this time. It was going to be more difficult to locate his position.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng warded Fenton's second attack off quite easily with his long sword. Once again, he was the winner.</p>

  <p>The two were chatting and fighting, as if they were playing games instead of real combat.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Fenton was surprised when he failed the second time.</p>

  <p>His first stab had only been a sort of test. Something to see how strong Luo Luo Zheng was. Fenton had used only thirty percent of his strength. So, it was understandable that Luo Luo Zheng had dodged the first stab so easily.</p>

  <p>But the second time, he had used the Forty-nine Wind Skills, so the power had been very strong. According to Fenton's guess, Luo Luo Zheng should have been in an awkward state even if he had resisted the attack.</p>

  <p>In his plan, he wanted to stab Luo Zheng's reflection in the Illusion Space with his third attempt.</p>

  <p>But, his second attack didn't work as he expected.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still looked calm. "I still don't understand. Why are the Space Law and the Time Law necessary skills for the warriors in the Upper World?"</p>

  <p>He asked when he dodged Fenton's second attack.</p>

  <p>"Yes! They are absolutely necessary. Which is why I've been staying in a secluded place to practice the two laws very hard for the last several days." Fenton moved over with a gust once more.</p>

  <p>This sort of information was very important for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It made sense for everyone here to honor time and respect space.</p>

  <p>These two Original Laws were extremely strong. Take the Time Law for example. If your opponent could change the time flow rate, he could move at a speed hundred times your own. And no matter how fast you moved, he would still be a hundred times faster since time was flowing differently for him.</p>

  <p>The only way to deal with a warrior practicing the Time Law was to practice the Time Law yourself.</p>

  <p>The same could be said for the Space Law.</p>

  <p>If someone had mastered the Space Law, he could move tens of thousands of miles in a single step. Thus, he could escape from his rival in a fight very easily and appear behind him the next instant.</p>

  <p>Hence, the Time Law and the Space Law were the basis of every law and also an essential requirement for all the warriors in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng and Fenton fought and chatted at the same time, there was a lot of discussion about them among the warriors in the Dragon Tiger Hall.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that this guy would be able to ward off two attacks from Fenton."</p>

  <p>"Take it easy, Fenton hasn't tried his best yet. Don't you remember that he always defeats his opponent in three strikes?"</p>

  <p>"But this guy hasn't used his full strength too. Look at his relaxed expressions! And he is still asking questions."</p>

  <p>"Hum, I think he's just pretending. I think he is almost frightened to death in reality and just putting up a brave face."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet! Fenton is going to launch his third attack," someone shouted.</p>

  <p>Fenton had a basic habit that he would never defeat his enemy with a single attack. His first stab was only a symbolic greeting, while the second one brought suppression against his enemies. Only with the third stab would he release his real power and finally come out on top.</p>

  <p>Over the years, in countless fights, Fenton had never broken this habit.</p>

  <p>Many warriors from the Myriad Spiritual Force House had also experienced the power of Fenton's third stab.</p>

  <p>In fact, some of them took this as an "honor" to boast in front of others,</p>

  <p>"I successfully dodged Fenton's first two stabs."</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Space, a fierce momentum was suddenly conveyed from the frenzied gale. Luo Zheng's face turned cautious in an instant.</p>
