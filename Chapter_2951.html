<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2951 Absorbed By The Whirlpool </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng told the others what he had seen with his spiritual sense at the bottom of the divine land.</p>

  <p>This information spiked Leopold's and the others' interest. They couldn't help but want to know more.</p>

  <p>Even in the Source World, few people would build such a large ship.</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship left behind by Clement was only fifty to sixty feet long. It was safe to assume that travelling through the chaos would consume plenty divine crystals.</p>

  <p>For a huge ship like the divine land to be travelling in the chaos, the number of divine crystals it needed to consume was astronomical. Leopold and Ramzi had previously discussed this matter when they were outside the divine land. They had no idea what kind of method the Grand Chieftain used to drive the ship.</p>

  <p>Timotheus asked Ramzi and Leopold to stay behind and check the flying ship out, but the two were more interested in exploring the bottom of the divine land instead. Thus, the four of them decided to follow behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>The great whirlpool's location was at the tail of the entire divine land. If one was standing above the Time Sea, then the whirlpool would be situated in the west.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current abilities, he naturally wouldn't have to dig through many layers of underground stones like he had done in the past. He gently waved his hand and built a space channel. As he performed this movement, he said to Emily and the others, "On the other side of this space channel is the Lethal Fire Magma. Before entering, I'm afraid we have to be prepared."</p>

  <p>Emily and the others understood exactly what Zheng meant.</p>

  <p>If they were to enter without taking absolute precaution, their bodies would be burnt to ashes in a split second by the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>In turn, Emily gently stretched out her own hands and surrounded herself with a colorful halo.</p>

  <p>On his behalf, Ramzi drew a piece of yellow rune paper from his pocket and stuck it onto his chest. It formed a golden circle of light.</p>

  <p>Now that the others had carefully prepared themselves in their own way, Zheng was the first to enter the space channel, followed by Emily, Timotheus and the rest.</p>

  <p>The space channel made by Zheng had greatly shortened the distance to the Lethal Fire Magma. After taking only four or five steps, they felt a heat wave pouncing onto their faces and licking at their skin. They knew that they had already fallen into a sea of Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>Sizz! Sizz!</p>

  <p>Ramzi was falling into the Lethal Fire Magma and the golden circle protecting him quickly began to erode. Simultaneously, the yellow rune paper stuck to his chest was quickly burned to nothing but dust.</p>

  <p>If the golden circle of light were to dissipate, then the Lethal Fire Magma would envelope Ramzi at once, which would instantly burn his body to ashes.</p>

  <p>Right then, Emily gently waved her hand, and another colorful halo quickly enveloped Ramzi.</p>

  <p>Standing next to Ramzi, Leopold said with a laugh, "Ha-ha! Ramzi, you even need a beauty to save you!"</p>

  <p>Ramzi, on the other hand, didn't panic at all. He slowly pulled out another piece of yellow rune paper and muttered, "Clearly, I've underestimated the Lethal Fire Magma's power. It can easily break my second-class body protection rune. But don't worry about me. I can protect myself with the first-class body protection rune instead."</p>

  <p>These Other Shore Realm warriors needed to use certain means in order to resist the Lethal Fire Magma, but Zheng, on the other hand, wasn't a part of this group. Unlike the rest, he casually wandered in the magma lake as though it were clear water. He let the magma bubble and burn; however, it didn't seem to hurt at all.</p>

  <p>"The Lethal Fire Magma is even boiling. How strange!" said Emily, looking around the lake.</p>

  <p>All around them, the Lethal Fire Magma hummed and gurgled like boiling water, and fist-sized bubbles constantly brushed and burst before them.</p>

  <p>"Where is this huge whirlpool that Zheng has been talking about?" asked Timotheus in a somewhat eager tone.</p>

  <p>"It's not too far away now. Just follow me," Zheng replied calmly.</p>

  <p>He continued to lead the way, ahead of everyone else, and the others followed him blindly, each step taking them deeper into the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>After travelling a good ten miles into the Lethal Fire Magma, they suddenly felt that the Lethal Fire Magma's movements had increased dramatically.</p>

  <p>They realized then that a huge force really was continuously stirring the Lethal Fire Magma, creating a great turbulence.</p>

  <p>Despite the turbulence's power, it was still unable to shake everyone. They still shuttled forward in a straight line.</p>

  <p>As they continued toward their objective, the turbulent flow became more and more powerful. Even the Other Shore Realm warriors needed to spend a certain amount of strength in order to resist it. However, at that very moment, Zheng suddenly stopped and pointed towards a place not far away in the distance and said, "It should be right over there!"</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma was a kind of emerald magma. In other words, one couldn't see through it. How could they see anything just standing here?</p>

  <p>Faced with such a situation, they could only use their spiritual senses to detect what was before them. Timotheus, Emily, and the rest extended their spiritual senses forward, but seeing as they didn't extend very far, Emily only frowned and grunted, "My spiritual sense has been cut off!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly! That's what I'd experienced before." Zheng, of course, had expected this result.</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded in agreement. "The whirlpool seems to refuse our spiritual senses."</p>

  <p>"Well, I feel as though my spiritual sense wasn't actually cut off, but directly sucked into the big whirlpool, losing contact with my soul," said Leopold with a frown.</p>

  <p>Ramzi looked up and immediately agreed with him. "Me too."</p>

  <p>Losing contact with their spiritual senses could occur in many ways.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the spiritual senses were cut off; sometimes, they were destroyed; and other times still, they were sucked up by some energy.</p>

  <p>"If our spiritual senses are being sucked into the whirlpool, then there must be another space in there!" Emily quickly jumped to another assumption.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'd say that's possible." Ramzi touched his chin. "Or, perhaps in the center of the huge whirlpool, there's a magic treasure that can absorb souls."</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and replied, "I stopped the divine land in order to verify whether or not anything was there, but after the divine land stopped and the big whirlpool disappeared, I found the area was empty. There is nothing in the whirlpool. Trust me."</p>

  <p>"So, again, in other words, there's a space in the center of the whirlpool," suggested Leopold.</p>

  <p>"If we want to know what's hidden within the whirlpool, I'm afraid we have to go directly inside," Zheng murmured, staring straight ahead.</p>

  <p>"But how can we do that? It'll be quite dangerous!" Emily, naturally worried, still wanted to discuss the possible danger they were about to face.</p>

  <p>It was then that Zheng gently stomped his feet and pushed himself forward like a sword fish.</p>

  <p>A vast force clearly surrounded Zheng. With his current ability and strength, he could resist this force, but he chose not so. He simply let the force pull him into the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Emily frowned to herself. She had no time to blame Zheng for his recklessness. Instead, she too, followed him blindly forward.</p>

  <p>Timotheus smiled bitterly as he walked.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Guards had already experienced countless dangers, and every time, they had no choice but to be extremely cautious. However, there was no other way around the situation they were facing right now, and therefore, they could only follow behind.</p>

  <p>With the Lethal Fire Magma's movement, Zheng began to move faster and faster. It wasn't before long that he was pulled into the Lethal Fire Magma's core.</p>

  <p>And standing within its heart, Zheng felt a trace of space fluctuation.</p>

  <p>'Leopold's judgment is right. There is a space in here!' Zheng thought to himself, amazed.</p>

  <p>Just as this thought flashed across his mind, he was sucked even further into the whirlpool's core, and Emily and Timotheus, who were following close behind, were next to be sucked in, too.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was enveloped whole by the space wave, everything around him began to whirl at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma was gone. The white crystal-paved path before him emitted pale and gentle light.</p>
