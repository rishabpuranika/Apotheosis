<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 183 The Shura Battlefield (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Payne walked over slowly and looked at Luo Luo Zheng. He frowned when he saw the wounds on Luo Zheng's body. Then he turned to Lennie and said, "So many bone spurs have penetrated this guy that his body looks like a sieve!</p>

  <p>How awful!"</p>

  <p>"If he were not so severely injured, I wouldn't have come to you," Lennie said crossly. Lennie had many kinds of pills with which to cure injuries.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was in a critical condition with a slim chance of survival.</p>

  <p>Lennie had no choice but to bring him to Payne.</p>

  <p>Payne stretched out his fat, short finger and slowly pressed on Luo Zheng's neck. At the same time, he carefully avoided the acupuncture needles on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Payne moved his hand over Luo Zheng's body, pressing along the way. Finally, he reached Luo Zheng's belly. Payne frowned when he felt something unusual.</p>

  <p>"This bloke's body... is weird! I have diagnosed thousands of people, but I have never seen such a body!" Payne said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Haha. He killed several demon generals single-handedly even though he is only a half-step into the nature level. I would be surprised if this bloke isn't special!" Lennie thought that all capable men had something extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Some of them cultivated a special cultivation method, some had a unique magic weapon and some had an extraordinary innate capability.</p>

  <p>The world was big, and it was filled with countless people who were either capable or could perform miracles. With their experience, Lennie and Payne were unlikely to be surprised at something they thought perfectly normal. Lennie continued, "Payne, stop pretending. You just want to raise the price. I warn you not to go too far!"</p>

  <p>Payne smiled sheepishly, "What I have said is true. Have a look at this bloke's meridians. They are as hard as gold and iron. It is like his body is not made of flesh and blood. Can you find another like him in this world?"</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap. Tell me what you want," Lennie stated unkindly.</p>

  <p>Payne nodded and continued, "Since all five of his organs have been destroyed, he is in a serious condition. He has a slim chance of survival.</p>

  <p>I can cure him, but the price is..." Payne paused for a moment. Then he flashed three fingers.</p>

  <p>"30 cubic crystals?" Lennie gawked with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Hey!" Payne sneered. Then he shook his head and added, "Three thousand!"</p>

  <p>Lennie's face turned red. He screamed, "3000 cubic crystals? Are you trying to kill me?"</p>

  <p>"If you can't pay that much then you can take him away. But remember this. It would be difficult to find another to cure him in all of White Emperor City." Payne waved his hand in dismissal.</p>

  <p>"I will pay the 3000 cubic crystals," Nina said resolutely. All this while she had been standing in silence and listening to the men negotiate.</p>

  <p>"Forget it. Nina, I promised you that I would bear the expense. How can I let you pay? I can afford the cost," Lennie mumbled. "It is only 3000 cubic crystals. Just consider it as my gift to my future nephew-in-law."</p>

  <p>Nina's eyes widened, and her cheeks flushed crimson. Embarrassed by what Lennie had said, Nina shouted angrily, "Uncle! Why are you talking nonsense? I have known him for only one day!"</p>

  <p>Lennie laughed, "One day is enough. What a chance meeting! He must be special for I have never seen you so worried about somebody."</p>

  <p>"Uncle, if you talk nonsense again, I won't speak with you!" Nina threatened before turning away from Lennie.</p>

  <p>"All right! I was just joking." Lennie tried to comfort her when he saw that Nina was genuinely upset with him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Payne waved his hand and announced, "Since we have agreed on the price, I will begin my work. Please, wait outside."</p>

  <p>After driving them away, Payne pulled out four pills of different colors.</p>

  <p>He put the red pill in Luo Zheng's mouth and then crushed the remaining three into powder. He mixed the medicinal powders before sprinkling them on Luo Zheng's wounds.</p>

  <p>The medicinal powder had magical properties. As soon as they fell on Luo Zheng's wounds, the injured flesh fell off, and new flesh began to grow.</p>

  <p>The skin grew so quickly that in no time, it fused with the new tissue on the other injuries. Within the blink of an eye, the bone spur wounds on Luo Zheng's body had healed.</p>

  <p>But only on the surface! Luo Zheng's real wounds were inside his body.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Payne stretched out his hand and began to remove the acupuncture needles Lennie had placed in Luo Zheng's body. Now, Luo Zheng's life was being protected by these needles, so every time Payne took one out, Luo Zheng's chances of survival diminished.</p>

  <p>However, Payne had summoned his life vitality in his hand as well. As he removed a needle, he placed some life vitality in its place. Payne's life vitality was akin to fresh blood as it repaired Luo Zheng's internal injuries.</p>

  <p>So each time Payne removed a needle and then applied life vitality, Luo Zheng's chances increased and decreased.</p>

  <p>The process was slow and tedious and demanded all of Payne's energy.</p>

  <p>In no time, Payne's forehead was beaded with sweat.</p>

  <p>Six hours later...</p>

  <p>Payne walked out of the room.</p>

  <p>Nina rushed forward and asked with concern, "Doctor Xue, how is Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Payne laughed, "You worry as though he were infected with some complex or challenging disease! He was just injured. He is fine now and will be better once he has rested for a day or two!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was critically wounded after his fight with the demon generals. If he had consumed high-grade pills such as the Red Cloud Pill or the Nine Turns Recovering Pill immediately after the battle, he would have recovered on his own and wouldn't have needed Payne's help.</p>

  <p>However, there was a long delay, and Luo Luo Zheng had become too weak. This was why Lennie had thought it necessary to bring Luo Luo Zheng to Payne.</p>

  <p>From the time Lennie placed the acupuncture needles in Luo Luo Zheng, till he recovered, Luo Luo Zheng was in a dreamless state.</p>

  <p>After he woke, Luo Luo Zheng took a few minutes to remember what had happened.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng looked around, he found that he was lying on a bed.</p>

  <p>He stretched his hand and gingerly touched his chest. Shock was reflected in Luo Zheng's eyes when he realized that his wounds were gone.</p>

  <p>"I am fine? All my wounds have healed?" When Luo Luo Zheng found that there was nothing wrong with his body, he sat up. Then he jumped down from the bed and stretched.</p>
