<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Five minutes had passed, but Luo Zheng and the little monster hadn't budged, standing still and motionlessly like statues.</p>

  <p>A soul level confrontation would normally take a split second to finish, rarely stretching for this long. The confusion pulsed in the air, increasing with every second.</p>

  <p>The mysterious furnace continued to spin. After a long time, the lid of the mysterious furnace opened once again. The stream of multicolored will left the furnace and floated quietly in Zheng's mind, emitting a pure and multicolored light.</p>

  <p>"The will of this great world seems to have become extremely pure," Luo Zheng said softly as he gazed at the brilliant luster that reflecting off the will.</p>

  <p>Previously, the little monster had controlled the will of the great world and had infused into it a trace of evil energy. Something of the little monster's nature had somewhat influenced the will of the great world.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon said, "His soul has already been refined and now, the will of this great world has no owner. You can devour this will, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was referring to the little monster. The soul of the little monster had been refined, which meant that the will of this great world had been purified.</p>

  <p>Xun extracted her hands from Zheng's and smiled, fatigue tinging her eyes. She then turned to him and said, "Go, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not notice the tiredness on Xun's face as he nodded and slowly approached the pure will. Luo Zheng was some distance away when the pure will began to flee from Luo Zheng, as if evading capture.</p>

  <p>Although the will of the great world itself hadn't awakened, this will was still able to perceive Zheng's actions. It wasn't willing to be devoured by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But no matter how far it fled, it was still circling in Zheng's mind. It couldn't escape Zheng's mind if no one was controlling it. So it was technically impossible for it to escape from Zheng's hunt.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul finally caught up to the will soon after. The moment he touched the will, his soul trembled and a storm of information swept through Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was drowning in a massive illusion and saw a world in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Is this the projection of the entire great world?"</p>

  <p>Countless mountains and rivers, boundless oceans, and trillions of creatures appeared before Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Human figures began to appear before Luo Zheng, one by one. The number of faces that popped up was astonishing. Among them were ordinary mortals, nature creatures, and even powerful warriors of the Internal Elixir Realm, Virtual Tribulation Realm, and Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"Are these all of the humans in this great world?"</p>

  <p>These figures appeared in front of Luo Zheng and disappeared almost instantly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had swept across all the humans in the great world in a matter of moments.</p>

  <p>"That's Olivia! Olivia from the Purple Heart Sacred Place!"</p>

  <p>The scenes flashed too fast and Luo Zheng was only able to catch a glimpse of Olivia's figure. After all, although Luo Zheng had gone to many places, the number of people he knew in the entire great world was too small.</p>

  <p>Soon after came all sorts of fierce beasts from across forests, secret lands, mountains, and seas, including all races of this great world. They spread out before Luo Zheng like paintings unfolding before his very eyes, and they disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>When all the images disappeared, Luo Zheng felt as if an enormous amount of memories had embedded themselves in his mind.</p>

  <p>"These memories seem to contain information about all living beings from the dawn of time till now. They are the memories of this great world itself," Luo Zheng muttered, his heart skipping a beat. 'I wonder if I can access these memories, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Moments later, a smile appeared on Zheng's face. He had realized that it was easy for him to access these memories, almost instinctively.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Luo Zheng found Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was still lying down quietly in the Heavenly Stellar Palace. The scene playing out in the memories was very clear. It felt to Luo Zheng that if he reached out a hand, he would be able to touch her.</p>

  <p>After he had left for the Divine Kingdom Continent. Luo Zheng was most worried about Ning Yudie. Although he had used the life stones to replenish her life force, it was far from enough. Now that he had seen Ning Yudie safe and sound, his face relaxed into a pleasant smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed, emotional at the realization that the will of the great world had such great use. This way, wouldn't there be no secrets in this great world for Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng withdrew from the mass of memories. It was then that he realized that his soul had been completely restored when he had devoured the will of the great world, and the cracks on the surface of his soul had disappeared. Not only was his soul flashing a dark green color, but there was also a colorful shine to it.</p>

  <p>'After refining the will of this great world, I have now become the son of the plane, ' Luo Zheng thought and looked at Xun.</p>

  <p>His own soul had been restored, but the surface of Xun's soul was still covered in countless cracks. She looked pale and her eyes were losing their shine.</p>

  <p>In the fight against the will of the great world, not only had Zheng's soul been severely damaged, but even the souls of Xun, the cyan dragon, and the red dragon had suffered damage to varying degrees.</p>

  <p>When Xun met Zheng's gaze, she smiled faintly at him and said,</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, I'm fine. I just need some time to recuperate."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and said seriously, "I will help you recover your soul."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon interjected flatly, "By the time you find a way to recover her soul, it would probably have already vanished into thin air."</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart dropped at the cyan dragon's words. "What do you mean?" he asked the cyan dragon nervously.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon said, "Although her soul has been baptized by the life energy from the Demon Night, it is still too weak. There's only a trace of it left. Right now her soul is on the verge of breaking apart."</p>

  <p>Xun did not speak.</p>

  <p>She knew the state of her soul very well. Through a secret method, she had used the life energy to strengthen her soul a lot. But the brutal truth was that she had only a strand of soul remaining and she almost had no ability to repair herself.</p>

  <p>Xun managed to crack a smile despite her knowledge.</p>

  <p>Of course she didn't want to die; to be more precise, she didn't want to perish. Her hatred to the other queen of the Demon Night had not been settled yet, and it was still too early for her to have her soul dissipate.</p>

  <p>But she couldn't decide her own fate.</p>

  <p>"Is there any way to recover her soul?" Luo Zheng asked, a trace of desperation in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the cyan dragon replied.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Zheng urged the dragon.</p>

  <p>If Xun's soul perished because of him, he would feel guilty for the rest of his life. As long as there was a sliver of hope, he would go all out to try and save Xun's soul.</p>

  <p>"It's called the Soul Nurturing Wood. You can let her soul inhabit it and the wood would slowly nurture it," the cyan dragon said rather nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Soul Nurturing Wood?</p>

  <p>Zheng's face hardened as he gritted his teeth. What even was the Soul Nurturing Wood? He had never heard of it and now he was supposed to find it! How?!</p>

  <p>"This is a treasure from the Upper World. It's normal that you haven't heard of it," Xun said. She didn't have much hope of finding the Soul Nurturing Wood in the Lower World and looked dispirited.</p>

  <p>The Upper World!</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered as he said, "I can enter the Genuine Dragon World to search for it!"</p>

  <p>After the Martial Arts Contest ended in Oracle City, the Dragon Soar Arena fell into the hands of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. When the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been destroyed, the Dragon Soar Arena was later occupied by the Heavenly Evil Sect before being taken away by the World Commercial Alliance. In the end, the Dragon Soar Arena had gone back to Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't think it a problem for him to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we won't be able to wait that long. Look at her! She probably won't last beyond one or two days," the cyan dragon said flatly.</p>

  <p>One or two days!</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng gave up exploring the Feather Holy Sea, he still wouldn't be able to return to the Central Region within that time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if Luo Zheng gave up exploring the Feather Holy Sea now, he would have to wait for another year to obtain the life stones. But Ning Yudie wouldn't be able to hold on for that long.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng couldn't help but clench his jaw. He became even more anxious. What should he do?</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed and he finally noticed the large mass of memories in his mind. Would he be able to find the Soul Nurturing Wood through these memories?</p>
