<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soon as it touched the ground, it started to dissipate like mercury spilled onto the earth. This whirlwind was the vitality between the heavens and the earth!</p>

  <p>The vitality itself was extremely violent and dangerous, especially when it had not been refined by practitioners and transformed into life vitality yet. But due to that precise reason of not being refined, it still contained a trace of the natural law in it.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was said that when a practitioner reached higher levels of cultivation, and entered stronger realms, he would, in theory, be able to utilize this vitality between the heavens and the earth at his will. It was almost like commanding the world!</p>

  <p>However, merely at the rank of nature level consummation, Tianming could not directly make use of the vitality. That did not matter today. The Heavenly Sword never actually "used" the vitality. It merely "drew support" from it and that, it could manage without Tianming's help.</p>

  <p>Even drawing support from the vitality meant that Tianming was extremely powerful beyond thoughts and imagination.</p>

  <p>"Four in one!" He commanded.</p>

  <p>A faint shadow of a sword intent appeared around Tianming's Blood-corroding Sword. He had employed the sword intent to trap the natural law inside his sword. Using this extreme momentum which could generate ultra high quantities of impulses, he thrust immediately at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although sword movements were of great importance in combating, the role those movements played could be outshone by the absolute power the sword carried.</p>

  <p>As the sword shoved forward, it was like the sky had flipped over! The very air seemed to vibrate and twist. The sun seemed to shimmer!</p>

  <p>The power of Tianming's four-in-one sword was formidable to say the very least. But it completely differed from Jacques's soul attack, and was not supposed to cause any damage to one's spirit.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the audience was just a bit out of breath due to the overbearing air of this sword, unlike the last time when Zheng and Jacques battled; in that battle, their souls had been bled dry of courage and they were almost gone. This time around, their souls were intact.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Tianming's sword, an opponent who was a little wimpish or didn't have a strong willpower would have practically wanted to turn around and flee, because he wouldn't have had the guts to face it!</p>

  <p>The disciples of Cloud Sect who were standing or sitting off the arena were already so unnerved; one could imagine just how Zheng was doing on stage.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng felt like he had entered a fairyland!</p>

  <p>Everything looked ethereal, and there was only one gull on this land. He was standing by an endless coastline all alone, watching the entire sky collapse and bear down upon him.</p>

  <p>This was not a spiritual attack. And all the scenes Zheng saw were just a series of illusions caused by the menacing air of the sword.</p>

  <p>"It's just some support he has drawn from the heavens and the earth, but the effect is already so amazing. What a powerful method! It's dangerous too, a bit too extreme for my taste."</p>

  <p>Clutching his Streamer Sword, Zheng cried to the sky, "How do I tackle this one?"</p>

  <p>If this were any other disciple facing such a situation, he or she would have most probably been on the verge of having a nervous breakdown.</p>

  <p>Once his heart went unsteady, he would lose the battle right away and wouldn't find any more chance to turn the tables!</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's heart had long since become as tough as a rock. Even if the sky had really caved in this time, he would have fought through till one of them won. And this? This was only a bluff that Tianming made up with the help of the vitality his method was drawing support from.</p>

  <p>As the illusion advanced on him, Zheng's life vitality slowly began to circulate inside him, almost as if in self defense.</p>

  <p>His demonic life vitality gradually climbed up along the hand that was holding his sword. Stars were glittering above the dark purple aura of life vitality which was fluttering around the Streamer Sword. The stars themselves were roaming around in spirals or ellipses.</p>

  <p>"Flick the sword!"</p>

  <p>This was the most powerful move that Zheng had grasped by himself whilst learning 'basic swordsmanship'.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously as his sword stabbed forward, the spots of starlight strewn across the demonic life vitality suddenly sprang to life!</p>

  <p>In theory, each of these spots could release a shot of overwhelming energy, which was already quite potent.</p>

  <p>But right before the All Peaks Competition, Zheng had, without any prior intentions, unexpectedly entered the Sun Moon Stars Picture. In there, he had received an insight on how to boost the power of the starlight while he was observing and meditating.</p>

  <p>It was theorized that the collision of even two spots of starlight could make the already overwhelming energy 10 times more dangerous!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>With a deafening bang, two of the spots crossed paths and clashed, radiating blinding rays of light as if two real stars in the sky had bumped into each other.</p>

  <p>Precisely at that very second, Zheng's sword lunged forward.</p>

  <p>Aided by the fusion of the stars, his sword was now carrying fierce and terrible amounts of energy.</p>

  <p>'He has merely taken advantage of a bit of the vitality between the heavens and the earth. Meh! That aura is nothing, Tianming. Even if the sky had actually fallen down, I would have still crumbled you!' Zheng bellowed inside his mind, strengthening his resolve even more.</p>

  <p>Tianming's four-in-one sword converged with Zheng's sword. At that moment, both of the contestants saw the towering determination in each other's eyes!</p>

  <p>They were both determined to win in any possible way!</p>

  <p>"BANG!"</p>

  <p>With another loud clang, a ball of blazing light instantaneously rose from the arena.</p>

  <p>As its shine increased and reached blinding levels, everyone felt the heat and became blinded for a moment.</p>

  <p>After quite a while, the audience gradually started to recover their vision.</p>

  <p>What was going on! Slowly, as the arena came into focus, they saw that Zheng was still standing in the same spot he had been, as motionless as a statue, while Tianming had been forced five steps backward, with a trace of blood hanging at the corner of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Holy cow! Zheng's one sword attack pierced the monstrosity that Tianming conjured up!" A disciple shouted indecorously.</p>
