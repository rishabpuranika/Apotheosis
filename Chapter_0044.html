<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 44 Luo Zheng’s Anger (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In addition to the thousand disciples who had passed the initial exam, another group of people would also take part in this Blooded Test. This group of disciples came from the noble clans.</p>

  <p>Because of their status, the participants from noble clans did not need to pass the initial exam. They could join the Blooded Test directly...</p>

  <p>Compared to ordinary disciples, the disciples from noble clans followed different rules and had special privileges during the test.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of chariots filled the sky and hid the sun. The flying chariots flew lower from the sky and landed on the ground, neatly parking in front of the mountain. Three or four people accompanied each participant from the noble clan. Masters who radiated a strong Mu Ning were among the people accompanying the participants from noble clans.</p>

  <p>When disciples of noble clans saw the thousand ordinary disciples on the ground, their expression conveyed the disdain they had. Considering their families and upbringing, these disciples from noble clans felt superior to the other disciples.</p>

  <p>After dismounting from the flying chariots, the disciples of noble clans formed a small group, but they did not come near to the ordinary disciples.</p>

  <p>At this time, the thousand ordinary disciples were resentful toward the attitude shown by the disciples from the noble clans. Under normal circumstances, these ordinary disciples would not feel anxious about being asked to wait for several hours. However, they felt that by waiting for the disciples from noble clans to arrive, their time had been wasted.</p>

  <p>Although they were angry, the ordinary disciples didn't dare to speak out loud. They mumbled few curse words in a low voice. As they had no influential background, the ordinary disciples knew they could not challenge the disciples of noble clans. They did not have the power or resources to afford offending the noble clans.</p>

  <p>What added to their resentment was the unfair advantage the noble clans had. The disciples from noble clans had access to better training since childhood. They also had the resources to acquire all kinds of magic pills that would refine their bodies and skills. As such, their abilities and power would be higher than those of the ordinary disciples. Now, they were competing against the disciples from noble clans. Provoking the disciples from noble clans would not end well for ordinary disciples. They were afraid that the participants from noble clans would gang up against them and attack them during the test.</p>

  <p>A murmur rose through the crowd of ordinary disciples when they noticed a small group of disciples from noble clans heading their way.</p>

  <p>Feeling the anger radiating from this group, the ordinary disciples subconsciously gave way to them. The crowd dispersed on both sides of the disciples from the noble clans. However, one man stood in their way. That man was Luo Zheng. He had closed his eyes in order to meditate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been standing with the ordinary disciples for a long while. When he realized that it was meaningless to wait for more instructions, he decided to conserve his energy and prepare for the test. Ever since he learned that he could penetrate deep into his consciousness, he often maintained a state of meditation and paid no attention to what was happening around him.</p>

  <p>But suddenly he sensed something different was happening around him. A deafening silence replaced the low-toned gossips and chats. When he opened his eyes, Luo Zheng saw a group of well-dressed disciples from noble clans heading in his direction.</p>

  <p>Unaware of what might have transpired in the time when he was meditating, Luo Zheng glanced at the other disciples from the corners of his eyes.</p>

  <p>Then he noticed that the crowd had split into two, thus allowing the disciples from noble clans to walk straight toward him. Until then, Luo Zheng had realized that the group was coming for him.</p>

  <p>"Hi, what's up?" asked Luo Zheng with a smile. He behaved politely. Since he did not know the intention of these people, Luo Zheng tried not to offend them until he had a better understanding of their purpose. He knew that it was harder to make friends than it was to make enemies.</p>

  <p>The group of disciples from the noble clans stopped in front of Luo Zheng. A moment later, two men stepped out from the middle of the group. One was Billy, and the other was Perrin, Zheng's cousin.</p>

  <p>On seeing Perrin, Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and gave him a cold look. He withdrew his smile and said in an expressionless voice, "Perrin, are you kidding? Why are you involving so many people in the affairs that only concern you and me?"</p>

  <p>Perrin sneered. A wicked smile appeared on his face. He was about to say something, but Billy patted Perrin on his shoulder unexpectedly, and said,</p>

  <p>"Perrin, let me talk to him." Then he sauntered up to Luo Zheng and laughed. "I heard that you sent a message for me. I should not interfere in the matter between you and Perrin. Is that correct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is right. Mr. Wang, the friction between Perrin and I is our family affair. And I do not see why you need to get involved," said Luo Zheng calmly.</p>

  <p>Since Billy was talking to him, Luo Zheng decided not to show how angry he was about the interference.</p>

  <p>Billy looked down and smiled. Then he grasped a butterfly jade pendant in his hand. He toyed with the pendant as he slowly circled Luo Zheng and then he said, "I don't agree with you. In fact, I feel it is my business. Do you have a problem with this?"</p>

  <p>"It is our family matter. I hope that you will let us solve it between ourselves." Even though Luo Zheng wanted to tell Billy that the situation was none of his business, he decided to be diplomatic and indirectly convey his meaning. Luo Zheng even went as far as to cup his one hand in the other before his chest to show his respect. It would be best for him if Luo Zheng could persuade Billy. He did not want to provoke Billy right before the Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>"Haha, I take it that you haven't heard the rumors. I have never been reasonable. If you don't want me to interfere, promise me one thing," Billy raised his head and said.</p>

  <p>"What thing?" Luo Zheng frowned. He did not think that Billy would compromise so easily.</p>

  <p>"Quit the Blooded Test, go to the Wang family shop in the south of the city, and buy a knife. Then go to the Wei River Bridge and kill yourself. After you have done all this, I will not get involved in your family affairs," said Billy. His tone was indifferent as though he was talking about a trivial matter.</p>

  <p>After hearing Billy's words, a flush of red rushed to Zheng's cheeks. Anger exploded in his heart. However, a moment later, Luo Zheng suddenly burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha. What a funny joke!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had sworn to avenge his father's death a long time ago. Even though Billy sent four men to beat him during the initial exam, Luo Zheng had not retaliated much. One of the reasons was that he did not want to provoke Billy. After all, the Wang Clan was a noble clan, and Luo Zheng was alone.</p>

  <p>After everything Luo Zheng had done, Billy was still being inconsiderate and meddlesome. To Billy, it must seem as though Luo Zheng was a small ant who could be killed easily. Billy had not taken Luo Zheng seriously at all. It appeared as though to Billy, Luo Zheng was already a dead man and hence, in no position to negotiate with him.</p>

  <p>Compromise was useless when dealing with such people. The only way to get Billy to back off was to use fists, not words.</p>

  <p>"Billy Wang, do you think that I'm afraid of you? You want me to quit the Blooded Test? You want me to kill myself? This is the most ridiculous joke that I have ever heard. I am standing here now. If you think you can take my life, just try. Let me see whether you have the ability to kill me!" After saying that, a strong Mu Ning burst from Zheng's body. Although his face was expressionless, Zheng's heart pounded with the anger he felt.</p>
