  <p>
</p>

  <p>After her life energy was drained, Yudie's appearance did not change.</p>

  <p>However, anyone who saw her could feel that the life energy in her body was very weak and could only keep her sleeping.</p>

  <p>With the continuous infiltration of the life energy of the life crystal, Yudie's pale and haggard face started to change.</p>

  <p>Her paleness gradually faded away and her cheeks became flushed once again. She now looked like she had regained her strength and energy.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning and Dorothea, they could also feel the life energy in Yudie's body increasing rapidly. They could feel like she was suddenly emitting a strong life energy. Ning Yudie was originally like a withered tree, but now new buds began to sprout and roots began to spread, giving people a sense of vitality and hope once again.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had now absorbed all the life energy contained in the life crystal.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at her, his eyes filled with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't she wake up?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>His eyes gradually darkened. The biggest reason for him to go to the Divine Kingdom Continent was to find a way to save Ning Yudie. The life crystal was his only hope.</p>

  <p>She had absorbed all of its life energy and she looked better, so why was she still unconscious?</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning felt sorry for him and was hoping to console him. Luo Luo Zheng, however, was like an iron statue, standing where he was without moving an inch.</p>

  <p>A look of surprise covered Dorothea's face, and her mouth opened slightly. She knew that after most of Yudie's life energy had been drained by the Life and Death Wind, her body had activated its self- protection mechanism and forced itself to go to sleep. Only by doing so, Ning Yudie would be able to save the last bit of life energy that she had within her.</p>

  <p>The flower in Dorothea's right eye turned slightly and an intangible sensation spread through her. Soon, a smile appeared on her face. Her talent was the flower in her right eye. She was much more sensitive towards souls than other cultivators of the same level. That was when she realized that Ning Yudie had already woken up.</p>

  <p>'Luo Luo Zheng has good taste when it comes to women, ' Dorothea thought to herself. Then, using her life vitality, she told Luo Luo Zheng, "She is awake now."</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat at Dorothea's words. When he saw Ning Yudie pretending to be asleep with her eyes closed, he felt both angry and amused. Ning Yudie had a lot of tricks up her sleeve. When she was before the elders of the Cloud Hall, she seemed very solemn, but most of the time she had the temperament of a child.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes and waved his hand. He then sighed and said, "She hasn't woken up yet. Let's leave."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not know what was going on and looked at Luo Luo Zheng with a puzzled expression. Dorothea smiled and patted Xi Youqin's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"He's right. Let's just leave. It doesn't seem like she will wake up any time soon."</p>

  <p>As Dorothea touched her, Mu Ning immediately moved a few steps away from her and glared at her as if she had been bitten by a scorpion.</p>

  <p>Dorothea didn't seem to care and only chuckled before the three of them left the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Right after Luo Luo Zheng and the others left, Yudie's fingers trembled slightly. If ordinary mortals had been sleeping like this for several months, their body functions would have been affected. They wouldn't even be able to walk for a long time, and their eyes would be closed for a long time, unable to withstand the sunlight or see anything around them.</p>

  <p>However, for Ning Yudie, a Life and Death Realm warrior, it was not a big problem. After all, warriors could cultivate in seclusion for eight to ten years, which was quite common. Their body functions were far superior to those of the mortals.</p>

  <p>Her fingers trembled for a moment, and then her body turned and floated into the air. She was very petite and was wearing an ice blue palace dress. The ribbons of the dress danced with her body, like blue ice flowers dancing in the cold wind.</p>

  <p>After her feet landed on the ground, she had a sly smile on her face as she carefully walked towards the main hall. However, before she could enter the hall, a figure suddenly came out and firmly held her in his arms tightly.</p>

  <p>"Aargh!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie let out a sharp scream frightened at Luo Zheng's sudden appearance. She had not used her perception to search around the palace. Otherwise, she would have discovered Luo Luo Zheng, who had been hiding behind a pillar.</p>

  <p>The two of them hugged each other tightly forgetting everything around them. Luo Luo Zheng lowered his head and kissed on her lips.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lifted Yudie's petite body in the air with his embrace. Her feet could barely touch the ground. She wasn't scared of losing balance and falling.</p>

  <p>She trusted Luo Luo Zheng with her life and knew he would always catch her.</p>

  <p>They hugged and kissed for a long time.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning and Dorothea stood in the main hall, quietly watching them.</p>

  <p>A myriad of emotions flooded Mu Ning. During the past six months, she had repeatedly reminded herself of who she was and her worth. She knew very well that Ning Yudie was much more important to Luo Luo Zheng than her.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but feel jealous of Ning Yudie. But she tried her best to remove those thoughts from her head, calm herself down and stay in the Heavenly Stellar Palace with the other servant girls to take care of Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Before this day, Mu Ning had thought she could peacefully accept the fact that she and Ning Yudie would share Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But now, Mu Ning realized how fragile and ridiculous her thoughts were.</p>

  <p>It should be even more difficult for a woman to overcome her jealousy than it was for a man to overcome his lust.</p>

  <p>Dorothea could feel Xi Youqin's emotions draining from her soul.</p>

  <p>Through the flower in her right eye, Dorothea could easily see people's souls and know of all their feelings and fears.</p>

  <p>She turned her head to glance at Mu Ning, and then said with a smile,</p>

  <p>"All men are like this. They are all two-timers, huh?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning rolled her eyes at Dorothea. Dorothea was also a beauty. Aside from the strange flower in her right eye, she was still beautiful. Mu Ning, however, was still feeling uneasy close to Dorothea.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Men are all two-timers, but Luo Luo Zheng is an exception." Mu Ning retorted.</p>

  <p>Dorothea, however, smiled and said, "Indeed. Luo Luo Zheng is an outstanding man.</p>

  <p>But in the end, he has more than one woman. What a pity! How about..."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, Dorothea took another look at Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"How about what?" Mu Ning was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>"How about you marry me?" Dorothea giggled.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning heard this, she glared at Dorothea furiously, and without containing her anger, she scolded her for the first time, "How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie embraced and kissed for a long time before separating.</p>

  <p>She stared at Luo Luo Zheng, who was just inches away from her. She had a sweet smile on her face, but it quickly disappeared. "Eddie..." she murmured.</p>

  <p>After being hit by the Life and Death Wind, Ning Yudie had fallen into a deep slumber. She had no idea how long she had been unconscious, nor did she know about the battle with the Heavenly Evil Sect. Although Luo Luo Zheng was standing before her, safe and sound, she couldn't help but worry about everything that had happened.</p>

  <p>"He is dead. I killed him," Luo Luo Zheng replied immediately.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded her head. Since Luo Luo Zheng was standing right in front of her, Eddie's chances of survival were very low. But she could not figure out how Luo Luo Zheng defeated Eddie and how he killed him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng briefly recounted the events that happened after Ning Yudie fell asleep.</p>

  <p>As for his journey to the Divine Kingdom Continent to find the life stones, he only mentioned it briefly.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had concealed the hardships of the trip to the Divine Kingdom Continent, Ning Yudie could guess that he had gone through a tough time. She leaned on Luo Zheng's chest and asked him to tell her more details. He could only answer truthfully. As she listened to Luo Luo Zheng retell his stories, she used her fingers to lightly draw circles on his chest, her mind wandering away.</p>
