<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What are you expecting? This guy to get to Stage Thirty-three?" Les asked furiously on the other side of the mirror.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had once regarded Stage Thirty-two as their base camp too.</p>

  <p>The race occupied many regions in Stage Thirty-two. The Blood Assembly stood at the center while the Other Shore races within a radius of a hundred miles were considered to bend to it.</p>

  <p>For the Element Spirit race, they might not take even an Eternal Realm warrior seriously, because the Eternal Realm masters were only rare in the Source World.</p>

  <p>As a great number of Other Shore races had gathered in the thirty-two stages, these races could always produce one or two Eternal Realm warriors after many chaotic eras of reproduction.</p>

  <p>However, after reaching the Eternal Realm, many chose to move to Stage Thirty-three. Very few chose to stay in Stage Thirty-two.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was special. He was the only one who had eighteen imprints, an indicator of the great potential he possessed.</p>

  <p>"I just have expectations for him," Claire smiled.</p>

  <p>"But don't forget that he is on the opposite side. He is our enemy, not our friend!" Les snapped.</p>

  <p>Claire chuckled at this. "Sometimes the enemy's enemy is also a friend, right?"</p>

  <p>Les looked startled but he finally came to his senses after a brief pause.</p>

  <p>"You mean our real enemy is the Nihility race?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Claire, nodding. "At the time, Eye Spirit's wrong decision gave the Grandmaster of Heaven a chance to survive. Who would have thought that that same guy would gradually become so powerful? He's now threatening the foundation of our Element Spirit race!"</p>

  <p>"Even so, do you expect the human race to stand with us? Is it even possible? Don't forget that we still have the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his fellows in our custody," Les said. .</p>

  <p>The conflict between the Element Spirit race and the human race was so huge that it was practically irreconcilable.</p>

  <p>"We don't need them to stand with us," Claire said with a mysterious smile.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that the conflict between the Nihility race and them is greater than what exists between them and us."</p>

  <p>The goal of the Element Spirit race was not to destroy the entire chaos, but to stabilize it into a normal state. The Nihility race, however, planned to destroy the chaos and return everything into nothingness.</p>

  <p>According to reports from Xuanyuan, a warrior who had been painstakingly trained by the Nihility race through the Black Ship also held a grudge against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Les was silent for a while before he spoke, "Does Eye Spirit agree with this idea?"</p>

  <p>"No," Claire said, shaking her head. "But I believe that he will agree."</p>

  <p>It was thanks to Claire's persuasion that Les had calmed down. "I will speak with Eye Spirit, but you need to guard Stage Thirty-two. What happened in the Blooming Jade Stage shouldn't happen here!"</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race hadn't ever expected the Blooming Jade Stage to face such defeat. It had shocked the entire race.</p>

  <p>No one had thought that Luo Zheng could release the bald giant from the Cold Prison, which in turn led to the loss of the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>The influence and strength of the Element Spirit race in the Grand Plain Stage were far greater than those in the Blooming Jade Stage. Moreover, the Grand Plain Stage wouldn't suppress their strength and they had the help of the Eternal Realm warriors. Hence, they would hardly lose as they did in the Bloom Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Claire, shrugging.</p>

  <p>Her figure floated in the ball, and her slender legs slowly gathered together before she burst into a flame.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the Heavy Stone, Luo Zheng and the others chose not to return to the temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The Grand Plain Stage was safe for them as long as they didn't enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>They continued to walk north for a while and as they did, triangular sculptures began to appear on the ground. A small round hole sat at the center of each of these sculptures.</p>

  <p>"These triangular sculptures are called Three Purities Stones. Only with them can one enter the first volume," Pearce explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze followed the densely packed stones. There were creatures sitting in the corners of a few of them.</p>

  <p>He found it strange that the three creatures sitting in the corners of the same Three Purities Stone all looked the same.</p>

  <p>"Sir, what's going on with these creatures?" Luo Zheng asked. "Have they already entered the first volume?"</p>

  <p>Pearce nodded and reached out to point at a Three Purities Stone. "The three creatures in this stone are actually the same creature. The one in this corner is his Soul of Light, this corner is his physical body, and the last corner is his Eternal Body."</p>

  <p>"The Eternal Bodies of these creatures still remain here?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Pearce said, shaking his head. "Most of the Eternal Realm masters have entered Stage Thirty-three. These are just traces they've left here."</p>

  <p>Pearce then turned to Li Bianxue and said, "You can find a stone and enter it.</p>

  <p>Place your Soul of Light in it. This will improve your strength of the Holy Soul Realm."</p>

  <p>The Three Purities Stone integrated body and soul into one and sent the warrior to the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting. The warrior would obtain the Eternal Body after reaching the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>But the creatures in the Source World only appeared on the Other Shore using their Souls of Light and couldn't enter the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting. They could only place their Souls of Light in Three Purities Stones. It would, at the very least, improve the strength of their Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>For the Three Purities Stones close by, only one sculpture stood in each of them. Only their Souls of Light were in the stones.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue already knew of this method to strengthen herself. She nodded and found a Three Purities Stone sculpture. She gently hit the Light Stone in her hand to the ground and went into the white vortex produced by the stone.</p>

  <p>Everyone waited outside. When the white flash began to refresh the bronze ground, they saw Li Bianxue's Soul of Light appear on one corner of the Three Purities Stone.</p>

  <p>Even after Li Bianxue emerged from the ground, they could still see her figure within the stone.</p>

  <p>"I'm done," said Li Bianxue with a smile.</p>

  <p>Placing the Souls of Light in the Three Purities Stones could increase the strength of the Holy Souls by more than 10%, a design loophole.</p>

  <p>"It's your turn, Luo Zheng," said Pearce. "Since your Soul of Light hasn't arrived yet, you can place your body in it today."</p>

  <p>Like Li Bianxue, Luo Zheng found a Three Purities Stone sculpture, slammed a Light Stone into the ground and went into the vortex produced.</p>

  <p>The Three Purities Stone sculpture looked like a palm-sized triangle from the outside.</p>

  <p>Upon entering it, Luo Zheng discovered that it was not that small.</p>

  <p>There was an empty seat in each of the three corners of the triangle. He randomly chose a seat and sat down on it.</p>

  <p>The moment he sat down, his entire body seemed to freeze and become one with the triangle. . 'How do I get off now?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered, stunned.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, since even Li Bianxue's Holy Soul had been able to leave, there was no reason for his body to be stuck here!</p>

  <p>Just a gentle flow of his strength would make it easy for him to escape from the seat he was on.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was startled when he looked back. His physical body was still sitting on the seat!</p>
