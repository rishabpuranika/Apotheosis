<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Timotheus kept his eyes on Luo Zheng as he thought for a while. "I implore you, at least let the princess stay here, under our protection," he finally said.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how to sway Mike's mind, but knew that the least he could do was to ensure the safety of the princess.</p>

  <p>Lorena, however, had made up her mind. "I will stay with my husband no matter what," she said firmly.</p>

  <p>Timotheus had failed. The Nine Li Guards couldn't keep Lorena here against her will, and Mike, stubborn as a mule, was impossible to convince.</p>

  <p>However, Mike had promised that in the event that he encountered an insurmountable danger in the divine land, he would immediately send Lorena and the others away to safety.</p>

  <p>Even after all discussion had ended and Mike had left with his family, Timotheus remained rooted to the spot, his expression sulky and obviously disappointed.</p>

  <p>Seeing his face, Emily smiled and reached out a hand to pat him on the back, reassuring him. "Sometimes you should just relinquish control and let things run their course. And it might even be what Chiyou planned from the start, right?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," Timotheus said, more to himself than to Emily, nodding. "Anyway, we have to hurry and move as fast as possible."</p>

  <p>"The speed at which the space barrier recovers is much slower than we imagined. So we should be able to break through the space barrier a year earlier than we expected. At most, we will need three years," said Emily, pursing her lips.</p>

  <p>Timotheus did not like the sound of that. "If the Yellow Emperor Guards manage to escape from the seal, the situation on this ship will change dramatically. Three years is too much time. We need a faster solution,"</p>

  <p>Timotheus said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Let's go with what we know, rather than spend even more time thinking up a new plan. And think about it, not so long ago we thought it would take at least five years! Three years is a huge improvement, isn't it?" Emily said in an optimistic tone.</p>

  <p>As soon as Emily had finished speaking, a figure emerged from the giant vortex before them. It was a warrior of the Other Shore Realm from the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>This warrior was obviously tired, having exerted a significant amount of Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>"Now, it is my turn!" Timotheus exclaimed, and he charged forwards, into the mouth of the vortex.</p>

  <p>The space barrier between the divine land and the chaos could, given enough time, regenerate on its own, so they had to move quickly before the window closed again. They would have to work in shifts, one working while the other rested. Otherwise, all their previous efforts would have been in vain.</p>

  <p>Back in the divine land, on the Lofty Tree, the last of the orbs finally split open.</p>

  <p>A beam of purple light shot out of it, stopping as it reached the top of the Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>The man who had emerged from the orb was wearing a purple robe, a golden ribbon tied around his waist. His skin glimmered faintly in the daylight, and his eyes were clear and piercing.</p>

  <p>"Leyton!"</p>

  <p>"You are free now!"</p>

  <p>"Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>The remaining Yellow Emperor Guards similarly congratulated their leader, one after another.</p>

  <p>Leyton stood on the top of the tree, and as he gazed far across the land and towards the horizon, the corners of his mouth curved up into a smile.</p>

  <p>After they had accidentally found themselves aboard this ship in the past, they had spent many years here. Now that they had been released from the seal, however, they all had mixed feelings.</p>

  <p>Leyton was the last one to be released.</p>

  <p>As all of the Mixed Element Seals had been removed, the entire Lofty Tree began trembling violently.</p>

  <p>The strong sense of death in the North Star Region had completely disappeared. Signs of new life sprung up everywhere, and the bare branches of the Lofty Tree began to blossom, sprouting numerous little buds. If one observed the tree from a high point, they would be witness to a wondrous sight, seeing the tree transform from a barren stack of branches to a vibrant mass of blossoms.</p>

  <p>After many years of barrenness, the North Star Region began to bloom with new life.</p>

  <p>Not before long, the region would become home to a vast number of beings.</p>

  <p>"Leyton, please let me destroy this cursed tree!" Zavier said through gritted teeth, his face full of anger as he saw the tree erupt with new life.</p>

  <p>Having stayed trapped by this tree for so many long years, he resented its new life and beauty. He wished to see it gone, a pile of ashes.</p>

  <p>"Don't be so irrational. What fool gets angry at a tree? Harper was the one who trapped you, not the tree! If you want revenge so badly, why not find Harper and give him what he deserves?" Leyton chided. He seemed at ease and rational. "Haven't we already promised to help Samuel? Let's go to the Floating Islands first."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Samuel bowed to him in respect.</p>

  <p>A day passed. By then, Samuel had returned to the Hall of Holy Beings once again.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the hall, Samuel called loudly, "All Holy Beings, present yourself in the Hall of Holy Beings as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>When his voice reached the other Holy Beings, they began to whisper amongst themselves disgruntledly.</p>

  <p>"Here comes Samuel again!"</p>

  <p>"It's only been a few days since the last time he came here to pester us. He must love embarrassing himself!"</p>

  <p>"Does he think he is on par with Nicholas?"</p>

  <p>Despite their complaints, however, a number of the Holy Beings heeded his command.</p>

  <p>Even though Holy Beings of the alliance had little respect for Samuel, they did respect Hamish, and they knew that he was the one behind Samuel's actions. As much as they resented following Samuel, they wouldn't dare defy an Other Shore Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The first one of them to appear in the Hall of Holy Beings was Zeke.</p>

  <p>As soon as he appeared, he saw the five people standing in a row behind Samuel, and his expression transformed immediately. In the face of this direct evidence, he could no longer deny that Samuel was the one who had liberated the Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Murphy, Clark and other Holy Beings appeared shortly after Zeke in close succession.</p>

  <p>Just like Zeke, their faces filled with shock upon seeing the row of powerful warriors of the Other Shore Realm standing behind Samuel.</p>

  <p>Soon, all the Holy Beings from the alliance of the powerful clans had gathered in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Leyton took a casual glance at the Holy Beings who had just arrived and their abashed expressions. "Are these Holy Beings all members of the alliance?" he asked Samuel without taking his eyes off them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Samuel said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Leyton smiled, and a gentle aura spread out from him, blowing through the hall like a refreshing spring breeze. "You, followers of Nicholas and members of the alliance! You all helped us get rid of the Mixed Element Seals."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he flicked his fingers, shooting out a shower of golden lights which floated in the air before Clark, Murphy and the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' already confused expressions became even more puzzled as they observed the golden lights suspended in the air before them.</p>

  <p>Murphy took a small step forward, squinting at the light. "Is this a Sanskrit word?" he asked after a few seconds of staring at the light.</p>

  <p>"This is the complete Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, transcribed for you to understand. All you have to do is inject your spiritual sense into it," Leyton replied.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings all remained wide-eyed, their expressions vapid.</p>

  <p>However, as the information finally sank in, their expressions transformed into those of realization. Subsequently, they proceeded to channel their spiritual sense into the golden lights before them. Once the task was complete, however, this previously confused crowd of Holy Beings erupted with tumultuous joy.</p>

  <p>It was widely acknowledged that Nicholas's strength was far superior to that of any other Holy Being, as he was the only one who had mastered the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos. Although Nicholas had obtained many other advantages in the Sea of Truth, the other Holy Beings would definitely have a chance to become as powerful as him if they, too, gained entrance to the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the hall, Samuel furrowed his brows slightly. He didn't expect Leyton to be so generous as to provide those Holy Beings with the complete Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, Leyton's motives were not purely altruistic. He was aware that this was the most effective way to bribe the Holy Beings into convincing them to work for the alliance and remain loyal to it.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings all expressed their gratitude to Leyton, who waved his hand casually with an expression of feigned embarrassment. "Soon, we will be like a family, so you don't have to continue with all those ceremonies and formalities. But there is one other thing. Tell me, why aren't the other Holy Beings here? Surely you lot are not the only ones!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Those other Holy Beings are not part of the alliance," Samuel explained.</p>

  <p>"It's not that easy to subdue them or order them around."</p>

  <p>"Hm...I see..." said Leyton, scratching his chin.</p>

  <p>A smile still lingered on Leyton's face, however. With a slight bounce, he jumped upward and stayed suspended in midair.</p>

  <p>"Summon them to me," he directed Samuel.</p>

  <p>Samuel understood the innate meaning of Leyton's words. "All Holy Beings, I order you to come to the Hall of Holy Beings immediately. Come now or suffer the consequences!"</p>

  <p>"Really?" scoffed one of the Holy Beings. "I'd love to see those consequences. Bet they are terrifying!" the person continued, who turned out to be Gibson, his voice dripping with sarcasm. He had always been quick to mock Samuel in the past, and was not changing tack now.</p>

  <p>He would soon regret his words, however. As soon as he had finished speaking, an overwhelmingly intense Truth of Divine Dao spread, like an electric mist, from the Hall of Holy Beings and extended across all the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The moment Gibson felt the Truth of Divine Dao, the mocking smile slid off his face as if it were a block of butter on an icy ledge.</p>

  <p>"It's the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent!" he exclaimed, gasping with surprise.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent possessed by the Sword Clan was an incomplete version. This Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, however, was released by a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm. They were on completely different levels.</p>
