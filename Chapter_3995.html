<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3995 The Soul Catching Lamp </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>Sawyer's unconscious body fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng lowered his head and stood still. Previously, when Sawyer was being possessed by the Treacherous Being, he wasn't able to move either. This time, it seemed that it was trying to invade Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Brother!" Thurston quickly approached Sawyer's body.</p>

  <p>He carefully carried Sawyer to one corner to look at his condition.</p>

  <p>The others didn't pay much attention to Sawyer right now, for they were all focused on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew how important Luo Zheng was. If the Treacherous Being successfully invaded his body, there might be dire consequences.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in a panic.</p>

  <p>"We have to somehow find a way to drive the Treacherous Being out of his body!" King Ieuan said anxiously, also not knowing what exactly was needed to be done.</p>

  <p>Then, the Snake Goddess's eyes narrowed as she walked towards Luo Zheng. She stretched out her hand, and a pink flower lamp immediately materialized.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Catching Lamp!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes lit up as they saw the lamp emerge from the Snake Goddess's hand.</p>

  <p>The flower contained in the Soul Catching Lamp could forcefully drive the soul out of one's body.</p>

  <p>Even if that person had reached the Holy Soul Realm, he would still find it difficult to resist its power.</p>

  <p>However, despite its power, its use was quite limited. This was because the lamp needed to be close to the target in order to be effective.</p>

  <p>Because of this, it had never been used in battles.</p>

  <p>But now that Luo Zheng's body was still motionless, the Soul Catching Lamp came in handy.</p>

  <p>The only problem was that they weren't sure if the Treacherous Being was a kind of soul or not. If it wasn't, then the lamp would also be useless.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't have much time to think about it, so she just risked it.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the pink flower in the lamp began to glow. Wisps of pink smoke started floating out from it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess forcefully blew the smoke.</p>

  <p>The pink smoke quickly rushed towards Luo Zheng's face and entered into his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.</p>

  <p>Then, the Snake Goddess monitored the movements of the Soul Catching Lamp.</p>

  <p>In just a matter of seconds, the pink light in the lamp grew brighter and brighter as the flower started blooming.</p>

  <p>However, as the flower reached its full bloom, the light suddenly dimmed, and the petals began to wither rapidly.</p>

  <p>With a flash in the Snake Goddess's eyes, she yelled, "Now!"</p>

  <p>She started grabbing the Soul Catching Lamp and pulled it hard.</p>

  <p>She felt that the smoke inside Luo Zheng's body latched onto something, so she was trying to pull it out from him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Soon, wisps of pink smoke came out from Luo Zheng's eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.</p>

  <p>Everyone was expecting that the Treacherous Being would be pulled out along with the pink smoke.</p>

  <p>However, their faces twitched the moment they saw that there was nothing but the smoke.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was the most disappointed of all. She knew that she felt something earlier, so she was also surprised that nothing came out.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Unwilling to give up, the Snake Goddess once again blew the smoke into Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Right now, everyone depended on her, so she couldn't fail them.</p>

  <p>However, before the Snake Goddess could pull the smoke out again, Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Everyone was shocked to see that the pupils in his eyes had disappeared.</p>

  <p>His eyes only revealed the white parts, and it seemed that he was no longer in control of his body.</p>

  <p>Then, in a split-second, the previously motionless body of Luo Zheng quickly rushed towards the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng threw a punch at the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was totally caught off guard. At such a close distance, she wasn't able to dodge Luo Zheng's sudden strike.</p>

  <p>Although it was just an ordinary punch, the force it contained was still extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess instantly flew backward and was thrown far off to the point that she hit the circular space wall created by the Wing King.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng opened his mouth and did the same thing as Sawyer did earlier. He was howling.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned around and threw a punch at the green space wall.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The space wall instantly broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He then strode towards the exit of the village.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? What's he going to do?"</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Being doesn't look like it would wake up its companions."</p>

  <p>"Then, is it just going to leave this place?"</p>

  <p>Everyone had a lot of questions in mind.</p>

  <p>They also wanted to chase after Luo Zheng, but his speed was just too fast.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they wouldn't be able to do anything with the Treacherous Being's strength even if they caught up with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Previously, when the Treacherous Being had possessed Sawyer's body, it had easily resisted the theurgies of the Eternal Realm warriors. Now that it possessed Luo Zheng's body, it was more likely that its strength would also be stronger.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Luo Zheng had already rushed out of the fences of the Whining Road and disappeared through the vast white mist.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others just stood there as they watched Luo Zheng's figure vanish into the mist.</p>

  <p>They were left dumbfounded at everything that just happened.</p>

  <p>"But today is not the third day. Now that he just went out like this on his own, would he be lost on the plain?" King Ieuan couldn't help but ask anxiously.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Fuxi was busy helping the Snake Goddess heal her wounds. He looked back and said flatly, "Theoretically, yes. However, there may be an exception."</p>

  <p>After all, they all knew that the Whining Road belonged to the Treacherous Beings. Since it possessed Luo Zheng's body, then perhaps it wouldn't be lost.</p>

  <p>But there were bigger problems to be considered, like Luo Zheng's survival.</p>

  <p>Could he still survive after being possessed by it?</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was badly injured. But despite her condition, she hadn't stopped thinking of a way to save Luo Zheng. However, it seemed like she was also running out of ideas as her face showed an expression of hopelessness.</p>

  <p>Eventually, everyone had stopped talking and the atmosphere became even gloomier. At this moment, the silence was broken when they heard someone cough.</p>

  <p>"Ahem! W-what happened to me?"</p>

  <p>While everyone was getting depressed, Sawyer suddenly woke up in Thurston's arms.</p>

  <p>"Brother, you've come to!" Thurston was overjoyed. He was actually thinking if Sawyer was even going to wake up after being possessed by the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Everyone's attention focused on Sawyer. As he tried to recall what happened earlier, his face darkened. He started touching his face and his body but found out that he wasn't hurt.</p>

  <p>"Brother, you're fine now. The Treacherous Being has come out of your body," Thurston explained in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>All of them thought of the possibility that Sawyer might die. But it turned out that as the Treacherous Being left his body, it also left his body and soul intact.</p>

  <p>"This is actually good news!"</p>

  <p>"He's fine after being possessed by the Treacherous Being. That means that Luo Zheng could also survive!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. At least there is still a chance."</p>

  <p>As they saw that Sawyer was in good condition, everyone seemed to get a hold of a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>"I'm connected to the Civilization Artifact of the Green Jade Civilization, so I can sense his location. After we leave the Whining Road, we could go look for him," the Wing King suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's good to know then," Fuxi said as he nodded his head.</p>

  <p>Just earlier, they were almost about to give up. But now that they knew that there was slight hope of finding Luo Zheng, they decided to give their all for this slim chance.</p>

  <p>Now, one more Treacherous Being had left the Whining Road. Even if a Treacherous Being really revived at night, there would still be an empty thatched hut here.</p>

  <p>After several hours, the sky started to dim again.</p>

  <p>The Whining Road was enveloped in darkness once more.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Fuxi's treatment, most of the injuries of the Snake Goddess had already been healed.</p>

  <p>Then, everyone stabbed their ears again as they went into hiding inside the small hut.</p>

  <p>Through the thatches, they saw the Treacherous Beings flickering in bright white lights.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed as she concentrated on counting the Treacherous Beings roaming outside.</p>

  <p>She counted a few times just to make sure. The result was still the same, and there were a total of one hundred and ninety-eight of them. It meant that two were missing.</p>

  <p>The first one did not revive, and the other one was the one that possessed Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Then, the night passed. As dawn drew near, all of the Treacherous Beings returned to the thatched huts.</p>

  <p>They confirmed that one of the missing Treacherous Beings did not come back to life last night.</p>

  <p>All of their faces seemed to be filled with regret.</p>

  <p>They thought that making the move was a complete mistake.</p>

  <p>However, no one knew what the result might be, so they needed to give it a try.</p>

  <p>After that night, there was only one remaining.</p>

  <p>Then, they could leave the following morning and enter the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>
