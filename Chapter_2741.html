<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2741 Hooking </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Western Sea Monster hesitated for a moment before saying, "That guy lives in lava. It's one of the fiends' most favorite food, but it's too flexible. Usually, my body is used to hook it up..."</p>

  <p>"Hook it with your body?" Luo Zheng blinked his eyes a few times as his gaze swept back and forth across the beach.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the monster answered honestly. Although it was far from human, its features were very natural. Now, the monster's expression took on a look of grievance.</p>

  <p>In this area, the monster was considered a kind of low-level beast.</p>

  <p>It might be one of the fiends' food, but its biggest function was to lure that thing in the sea.</p>

  <p>"Well then, in that case, we can catch it. What do you think?" said Leland.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll have to wait, actually..." The monster said, unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"And why should we wait, exactly?" Luo Zheng asked, his brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"Not long ago, that thing was eaten by a fiend. I don't know whether it has been reborn now," the monster said with a light grin.</p>

  <p>Every single beast in the forbidden area would appear, over and over again.</p>

  <p>This was very similar to the divine might coins, which would appear at the same place time and time again, even after being taking away. The forbidden area was maintained by the Faith Energy, which explained the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>The monster, however, was obviously much luckier than the thing in the lava sea. That was a given.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that the monster wasn't quite popular with the fiends.</p>

  <p>As for the thing in the lava sea though, if it had been reborn, then it would surely be captured and swallowed by the fiends once again.</p>

  <p>In fact, the number of times that thing had been reincarnated was actually unknown.</p>

  <p>After he listened to the monster, Luo Zheng said, "I think that thing might have been revived. I can also give it a try!"</p>

  <p>At that, Luo Zheng reached both his arms upward and pulled at the air, as if he were tugging on a rope.</p>

  <p>With a little trembling and shaking of the surroundings, one of the tentacles buried deep within the sand began to emerge. Luo Zheng was pulling it out!</p>

  <p>As soon as he grasped the tentacle with his two hands, he shook it briskly. The tentacle shook in the air in a violent whacking motion, before smashing onto the lava sea's surface.</p>

  <p>The lava was scalding, and yet, the tentacle was capable of withstanding it with ease.</p>

  <p>It only took a few seconds before the enormous tentacle began to sink into the lava sea, slowly disappearing until there was nothing left of it at all.</p>

  <p>As Leland watched, he smiled and decided to draw a tentacle out of the beach himself.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng had done a few moments ago, he threw the giant tentacle into the boiling hot lava.</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods descended slowly from above. They waited motionlessly.</p>

  <p>All three of them were afraid of the monster. They weren't doing anything other than floating to one side. They didn't dare land on the beach.</p>

  <p>"Take your time hooking that thing... Can't I just leave now?" the monster asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, what do you think?" Luo Zheng retorted in a flat tone of voice, indifferently glancing at the monster.</p>

  <p>The monster stopped talking at once.</p>

  <p>Seeing as it was a beast of the forbidden area, this monster could be reborn infinitely.</p>

  <p>Every time it died though, it did have a consequence. It would weaken its own cultivation base.</p>

  <p>The measurement of the beasts' cultivation base in the forbidden area was quite different from that in the divine land. The cultivation base was measured according to the amount of their own Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Once the beast died, all the Faith Energy that it had accumulated before would become invalid, and it would have to collect Faith Energy all over again. Such wasn't any easy task at all.</p>

  <p>It was for this reason that the beasts in this area all lived a miserable, gloomy fate. They could only be reborn over and over again, living at the bottom of the food chain.</p>

  <p>Here, only very few fierce beasts could ever climb up to the top of the food chain.</p>

  <p>Of course, even if the beasts did make their way to the top, they'd be killed by the fiends immediately.</p>

  <p>The fiends were the most powerful monsters in the entire Abyss Demon Region, and they never let anyone forget it.</p>

  <p>Two tentacles were silently immersed deep in the sea of lava, no longer making any sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held onto one of them as tightly as he could and stood there like a statue.</p>

  <p>As he stood, he took the opportunity to read Tianming's Memory Flame through the Reincarnation Soul Weapon once again. Maybe something would come up this time.</p>

  <p>'Those Holy Beings are so powerful. After they left the purple mist, they quickly defeated the little fiends... Are they really going to step into the fourth stage that quickly?' Luo Zheng asked himself these questions silently.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, when Nicholas had led the Holy Beings out of the purple mist, those little fiends still hung on tight. They just wouldn't let them go!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Soul Devouring Bugs dispersed, the Holy Beings were also capable of using and spreading their spiritual sense at will.</p>

  <p>In other words, they could use the spiritual sense in order to find the location of the little fiends, causing their high moving speeds to no longer be their greatest advantage any longer!</p>

  <p>Nicholas simply didn't need to take action in person.</p>

  <p>At that point, even the Demi-holy Beings and the top consummate True Gods would have the strength to fight these little fiends off!</p>

  <p>After two of the little fiends were captured, Clark actually created a fire array. He placed the two little fiends into the array and burned them to nothingness.</p>

  <p>The other little fiends were well aware that these people were powerful.</p>

  <p>Thus, they chose to hide out in the purple mist and follow the Soul Devouring Bugs in retreat.</p>

  <p>Sure, the little fiends could be reborn infinitely, but they weren't stupid enough to serve their heads up on a silver platter! They wouldn't ask for their death.</p>

  <p>As the little monsters retreated, the members of the alliance of powerful clans didn't encounter any formidable attacks on the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region any more and quickly rushed to the entrance to the fourth stage...</p>

  <p>If the thick smoke in the air above the Abyss Demon Region could completely disperse, they'd be capable of discovering that the entire Abyss Demon Region was like a huge terraced field.</p>

  <p>The outermost circle was the highest, and the center was the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Around a huge altar at the bottom, there were several white jade skulls neatly placed.</p>

  <p>On the skulls could be seen a few special lines, and they looked quite artistic!</p>

  <p>Clearly, this was the fiends' unique craftsmanship.</p>

  <p>Within the fiend race, the True Gods' skulls were undeniably valuable and worthy.</p>

  <p>That said, it didn't mean that the skulls had any actual use for the fiend race. The fiends only took them as treasures, and placed them in their bedrooms for appreciation, almost like the trophies.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Right smack in the middle of the altar was a small round hole.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, a surge of dark red blood began gushing out of the tiny hole. The blood spread along the lines of the altar and poured into the skulls.</p>

  <p>Once these skulls were completely injected with blood, their sunken eye sockets immediately glowed with an eerie red light.</p>

  <p>Before long, all the sockets on the skulls were glowing.</p>

  <p>Once countless red dots could be seen throughout, a pool of blood began to flood the center of the altar! What the hell was going on?</p>

  <p>The blood quickly condensed and suddenly formed into the shape of a human baby.</p>

  <p>The baby started to grow from the size of a thumb to the size of a fist.</p>

  <p>Two small horns suddenly appeared on its head, and its skin turned dark red. Obviously, this was the exact appearance of the previous little fiend who had died not long ago.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! The Holy Beings have burned me! They're digging their own grave!"</p>

  <p>The little fiend hadn't even grown up yet, and an incredible rage had already appeared on his still slightly childish face.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a huge fist suddenly descended from above the altar!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The fist punched the altar straight on, and caught the little fiend between the two, making him turn into a cutlet.</p>

  <p>A loud, gloomy voice was next to sound out, "Luring the Soul Devouring Bugs into the third stage was not easy, but you've wasted such a great opportunity. What a group of waste!"</p>
