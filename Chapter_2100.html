<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2100 Wedding (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was afraid of the woman in front of her. However, after she saw the woman's actions, Mu Ning felt like the woman coveted something that belonged to her. With a pout on her lips, she craned her head to peer from behind Luo Zheng's back. A vicious expression was displayed in Xi Youqin's face as she glared at the blue-clothed woman.</p>

  <p>After she planted that petal, Estelle seemed to have lost her interest with Mu Ning. Estelle decided to stop her pranks against the pitiful lady. She said to Luo Luo Zheng indifferently, "I can't leave the Evolutionary Universe now.</p>

  <p>Why don't you let me return to that Immortal Mansion?"</p>

  <p>Estelle had had to block Murphy's strike, for which she had exposed herself.</p>

  <p>Those Holy Beings didn't dare to enter the Evolutionary Universe directly. However, if she left through the crack at the top of the Evolutionary Universe, it would lead to endless trouble. She would be in a bad situation.</p>

  <p>Once she returned to the Immortal Mansion, Estelle would be able to leave through the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Luo Luo Zheng would agree to this request of Estelle. However, he still asked doubtfully, "But the enchanted barrier around my Immortal Mansion has yet to be opened. Are you able to pass through that enchanted barrier?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng even raised an eyebrow as he asked his question.</p>

  <p>The entire Immortal Mansion was covered in a special enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had already obtained seven tokens, he still had one more to get from the True Path. He had yet attained complete control of the Immortal Mansion. As such, he couldn't remove the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng's current cultivation wasn't at the level of a Godly Genius. He could still improve his strength. As for the Swirl Forest, where the Immortal Mansion was located, it was indeed somewhere in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Once that enchanted barrier was removed, it would bring about an unpredictable effect. Chaotic chain reactions would be triggered. For example, Luo Luo Zheng might directly be disintegrated and turn into a ball of life vitality and disappear entirely.</p>

  <p>"That enchanted barrier can stop the other people. However, it can't stop me," Estelle said as she shook her head slightly.</p>

  <p>Obviously, her spiteful remark referred to Blayd, Big Mouth Wayne, and Master Evil.</p>

  <p>"I get it," Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head. Since the blue-clothed woman was in a hurry to leave, she obviously had a reason to be in a rush. Luo Luo Zheng extended his hand and bowed deeply. With a grateful voice, he said, "Master, I thank you on behalf of my father for helping the Evolutionary Universe pass through such a crisis!"</p>

  <p>As they saw Luo Zheng's gratitude, Master Feng and the other Supreme Lords also bowed towards Estelle. Their acknowledgment was in their expressions. The kindness of hers was not something that the people present could repay. They could only thank her verbally.</p>

  <p>Estelle accepted their gratitude with a smile. She then turned to Luo Luo Zheng and said, "I feel like you owe me a huge favor. In the future, you must repay me."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Your compassionate actions are unrepayable by the current me. However, if I can get into the divine land in the future and achieve something, I will definitely give you my all." Luo Luo Zheng rather liked this woman since she was open and upright. He immediately asked with a curious face, "But I still don't know your name."</p>

  <p>However, Estelle simply smiled and answered with a sweet tone, "Are you not my master? With my Enslaving Token in your hands, you can investigate everything in my soul at any time. Why do you have to ask me my name instead of just investigating it in my soul?"</p>

  <p>"I said that I would not peep into your secrets. I will keep my word," Luo Luo Zheng firmly replied. His expression was similar to a gallant knight.</p>

  <p>Estelle slightly raised her elegant eyebrows as she sent a flirtatious gaze towards Luo Luo Zheng. A blush even painted her cheeks. With a trace of incomprehension in her eyes, she said, "Alright, let me go back."</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Luo Zheng take out the token of mountain and place her within his Immortal Mansion. As for how to pass through the enchanted barrier and leave the Immortal Mansion, that was the blue-clothed girl's business. Luo Luo Zheng had finally granted the blue-clothed girl her wish.</p>

  <p>After Estelle had disappeared, Mu Ning was finally able to express her anger. With a reddened face, she said hatefully, "That seductive vixen!"</p>

  <p>The moment the words left her mouth, the crowd of Supreme Lords broke out in a cold sweat once again. They were shocked and frightened by Xi Youqin's emotional outburst.</p>

  <p>Even though the powerful woman had already left, she might still be able to hear them. What if she came back and felt offended?</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords waited for the woman in blue to smite them out of anger. Fortunately, the Supreme Lords' worries did not happen.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning looked at everyone's expressions and immediately felt bored.</p>

  <p>As such, she quickly fixed her gaze on Xun, "Hey! Aren't you angry?"</p>

  <p>Xun did not pay any attention to Mu Ning. She callously rolled her eyes, then turned her body to the other side and didn't even give Mu Ning a single look.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning was persistent. She continued to ask with a bold tone, "You must be jealous, why don't you show it?! You should express your thoughts more freely. It's not good for a woman to hold back her emotions."</p>

  <p>As she was continuously nagged by Mu Ning, Xun became utterly helpless. With her personality, she would probably directly attack if it was another person that annoyed her.</p>

  <p>As he watched Xun's expression grew more and more impatient, Luo Luo Zheng could only forcefully drag Mu Ning to another side.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin saw Mu Ning was safely sent back by Supreme Lord Lester with mixed feelings. Certainly, he knew that Supreme Lord Lester was continuously using all his strength to revive Nathan. He was naturally somewhat nervous, but he could not go and disturb him. Right at that moment, another space crack appeared, and Supreme Lord Lester walked out of the space crack.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Supreme Lord of Original Sin flickered as he asked nervously, "Is Nathan?"</p>
