<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors who entered the Endless Abyss wished to possess the treasures of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>But after experiencing the attacks of the strange vines, the warriors realized that the benefits of the underground palace were not to be easily obtained.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors had tolerated the whips of the vines, but other than Zheng and Freya, most of them had suffered light or heavy internal injuries.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the whips of the vines had obviously cast a shadow over the warriors.</p>

  <p>The first round of the Endless Abyss had been tough to tolerate. The next test would no doubt be even more difficult.</p>

  <p>It had to be known that the warriors were only talents of the three tenth-grade sacred places in the Dark World.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the human Magnolia Sacred Place, the Demon Night's Purple Bamboo Sacred Place, or even the ogre's sacred place, none of them could be considered as particularly important or popular compared to the sacred places in other supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Among the talents sent out by the three races, a few of them were at the Soul Sea Realm, while the majority were at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>They might be slightly stronger, but they could not be compared to the talents of the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>Entering the Endless Abyss meant that they would encounter opportunities to grow stronger. However, the treasures obtained would need to be handed over to their respective sacred places. Presently, many warriors were beginning to want to retreat.</p>

  <p>The issue was that they fell straight down as they stepped into the abyss.</p>

  <p>They could not manage to fly, so they could not go back.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was starting to feel depressed, they saw something deep in the abyss. Purple dots of light floated in the air at a distance.</p>

  <p>These purple lights were in a relatively motionless state. However, because everyone was falling rapidly, they felt the lights rapidly approach them in their vision.</p>

  <p>"What are those dots?"</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors reacted quickly and reached out to grab the spots of purple light.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Those are divine textures."</p>

  <p>"It's an ancient divine texture!"</p>

  <p>"It seems like the purple spots can help us return to the entrance!" a warrior cried out in excitement.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Freya also grabbed on to a purple light dot respectively. The moment they caught hold of them, indescribable consciousness effused from the dots. Everyone instantly understood their function.</p>

  <p>"Return..."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled as he held the dot and crushed it with a gentle pinch.</p>

  <p>It seemed like the Supreme Lord from remote ages did not set up the Endless Abyss simply because he wanted to lure warriors to their deaths.</p>

  <p>Even though the Endless Abyss was clearly full of danger, the Supreme Lord had given them a chance to go back on their decision.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had been on the verge of retreat were naturally overjoyed. They understood the use of the divine texture. They had been worrying about how to withdraw just before the divine textures appeared before them. How could they not be elated?</p>

  <p>They quickly activated the divine textures in their hands.</p>

  <p>Buzz. Buzz. Buzz...</p>

  <p>Very soon, a faint light enveloped their figures. At the same time, they stopped falling and with a rapid speed rose up into the sky, still engulfed by the purple light.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the number of warriors in the Endless Abyss decreased by about half.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes landed on Freya, who was deep in thought as she held a purple dot of light in her hand. "What do you want to do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Freya's face was slightly frozen.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, Freya was not willing to contribute to Zheng's troubles. Before this trip to the Dark World, she had thoroughly looked into any information on the Dark World in order to prove her value. She only wished that she could help Zheng when he asked for it.</p>

  <p>Freya could absorb and supplement the detailed knowledge, but her cultivation and strength would only accumulate slowly, day by day.</p>

  <p>If she stayed in the Endless Abyss, it would only bring Zheng more trouble.</p>

  <p>Thus, when she realized that the purple light could send her back, her first thought was to leave.</p>

  <p>However, after thinking for a while, Freya did not activate the divine texture. Instead, she put away the purple dot of light with a turn of her hand. "I want to carry on for a little longer."</p>

  <p>Although it was dangerous, Freya still wanted to see how far she could go in this Endless Abyss.</p>

  <p>In fact, Freya herself noticed that her personality and character seemed to be affected in Zheng's presence. Her confidence was also recovering little by little. As long as she stayed by his side, she would always be able to feel his confidence. People around Zheng were easily influenced by his strength and luck. They became determined like him.</p>

  <p>"Good!" Zheng nodded, "Try your best."</p>

  <p>The remaining warriors did not activate the divine texture. However, just like Freya, most of them did not crush the purple dots, rather they put them away. If they were unable to pass the next test, or if their lives were at stake, they could choose to activate the divine texture at a later stage.</p>

  <p>However, one other person did the same thing as Zheng. It was Lincoln.</p>

  <p>The moment he obtained the purple dot of light, he crushed the divine texture straightaway, for he understood that it could be used to retreat to the entrance.</p>

  <p>Lincoln was seething silently. Supreme Lord Winfred had almost killed him. Facing such an opponent, Lincoln had to go all out. He had to enhance his own cultivation as far as possible before the Illusion Battlefield opened up. This opening of the underground palace was his greatest opportunity to do so, so he absolutely could not allow himself to give up!</p>

  <p>The warriors continued to descend. Five minutes after passing the purple dots of light, a thin white line suddenly appeared at the bottom of the abyss.</p>

  <p>The thin line ran through the middle of the abyss, splitting it into two hemispheres.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>Because they were still far away from it, they were unable to see clearly what the line was.</p>

  <p>But as they got closer, someone shouted, "Blade! It's a huge blade!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face grew grave. It was indeed a blade. Since the blade's tip was right at the top, they only saw a white line flashing with sharp light.</p>

  <p>But the huge blade was not a threat to the group. After all, no one would be stupid enough to crash into it.</p>

  <p>However, as the first huge blade appeared, a second one followed. This second one was also placed in the abyss, but the blade was only half exposed.</p>

  <p>As they looked at the blades, they felt a chill in their hearts. If they turned their bodies, it would still be easy for them to avoid them.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Blade Mountain Trap?" Zheng asked Xun.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled. "You'll know soon enough!"</p>

  <p>Just as she finished speaking, three giant blades surfaced in the abyss, forming a small angle at their top.</p>

  <p>Although the number of blades had increased, the warriors still had space to dodge them because of the wide cross-section of the abyss. Only one person was not careful enough. He fell passing by one of the blades and was almost cut into two pieces.</p>

  <p>However, as everyone continued to descend, the number of blades in the abyss grew.</p>

  <p>Four, five, six...</p>

  <p>As they fell, there was no place for them to dodge the incoming attack.</p>

  <p>Their bodies were not nimble enough to shift around. They carefully avoided the nearing blades, but they were still surrounded by danger.</p>

  <p>"Ah!!!"</p>

  <p>One of the warriors was not able to shift in time and his arm was cut off by the blade. Drops of blood splashed out like rain of blood.</p>

  <p>Hearing the pitiful cry, Freya bit her lip and stared at the blade below her.</p>

  <p>One could imagine what it would be like being cut by that blade. If the vines only gave her a painful whipping, the blades would cost her life!</p>

  <p>She focused her attention on trying to dodge the silver-white blades.</p>

  <p>However, just as was the case with the other warriors, it was difficult to reverse directions in the air. They were very inflexible at the moment.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, an idea suddenly flashed in Freya's mind. She looked toward the top of the abyss. Then, she turned her body and slowly approached the side.</p>

  <p>Seeing Freya's movements, Zheng's face was filled with doubt. At the same time, Xun's voice rang out, "Ha-ha, that girl is quite smart. She has discovered the trick so quickly!"</p>
