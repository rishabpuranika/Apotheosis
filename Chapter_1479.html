  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Salvador..."</p>

  <p>The sound of Xun's voice drifted out of the Reincarnation Plate and echoed in this space.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Salvador swung the spear in his hand and knelt down on one knee with eyes dark as ink.</p>

  <p>"My queen."</p>

  <p>He was dressed in a snow-white robe and his long silvery-gray hair hung behind him. His delicate face was more beautiful than the face of any of the women that accompanied him.</p>

  <p>Salvador was the only man in the group. The other three? Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth? were all women.</p>

  <p>As Salvador knelt down on one knee, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth all followed suit.</p>

  <p>In the Reincarnation Plate, Xun looked attentively at the four.</p>

  <p>"You... How have you been?"</p>

  <p>At Xun's greeting, the four warriors trembled as they recalled their troublesome past.</p>

  <p>Seven hundred years ago, a vision happened in the universe. A crack appeared in the intact heavens; a corpse fell from it and landed on the Dark Purple Star.</p>

  <p>It was said that the corpse was the body of a True God.</p>

  <p>Countless races in the Upper World were excited at the news and sent warriors to the Dark Purple Star to investigate the corpse. The Demon Night was no exception. Xun sent Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth to the Dark Purple Star too.</p>

  <p>That day, Xun saw them off in person from her Hollow Hall.</p>

  <p>The four warriors would have to compete with the top warriors of the other races, but Xun had faith in them. Together, they could defeat a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>While Supreme Lords seldom showed interest in these types of happenings, this mission was not that hard to the four of them.</p>

  <p>However, right after the four left, Xun was struck with a bad feeling that made her feel ill. She could tell that something bad was about to happen, but she didn't know what exactly it was.</p>

  <p>Whenever this type of feelings came over her, she would ask Supreme Lord Leroy for counsel. But this time, Supreme Lord Leroy was still in closed-door cultivation, and she couldn't interrupt him.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, Xun heard the sound of chains. Then, she saw Yao appearing in front of the Hollow Hall. She was wearing a blue armor, the Saint Sky Armor, and holding her weapon, the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer.</p>

  <p>The Saint Sky Armor and Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer were two supreme divine weapons of the Demon Night. They both ranked top 50 in the Universe Spirit Tablet. When Xun saw Yao armed, she immediately realized what she was up to.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the Saint Killing Spear appeared in Xun's hand.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, ripples quivered across the surface of Xun's Pool of Faith. She adopted the fighting stance and began to extract the Faith Energy from the Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>If Xun was in her best condition, with the help of her Pool of Faith and her spear, she could even kill a Supreme Lord. After all, she was the Queen of Killings, the strongest weapon of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Yao didn't make a move. She kept on swaying the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hands. Strands of lightning flashes appeared like snakes around the hammer. These lightning flashes were very thin but contained the eighth layer of Thunder Law, as well as a fatal Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>Only those who had been hit by the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer knew how powerful the weapon was. And those people didn't live to tell their stories. They had all been killed.</p>

  <p>Time went by.</p>

  <p>The entire Hollow Hall went silent. Xun panicked as she realized that she was unable to extract the Faith Energy from the Pool of Faith. It was the first time that she had failed to do so since she had become the Queen of Killings.</p>

  <p>"Did you seal my Pool of Faith?</p>

  <p>That is a capital offence in the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The Board of Elders won't let you go unpunished!" Xun threatened.</p>

  <p>Yao did not speak. She stepped towards Xun, making crisp sounds with her sharp high-heeled boots that echoed across the Hollow Hall.</p>

  <p>Even though she had made a careful plan, nobody but herself would dare to bear the crime of killing the queen. She had to be the one to do it.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Xun asked in a cold voice. A faint cold light lit the tip of the spear in her hand. Without the Faith Energy, she couldn't defeat Yao.</p>

  <p>Yao smiled upon hearing the question. "Why? Let me see. Well, the reason is simple. I just hate you."</p>

  <p>Not long after, earthquakes hit all the Demon Night's sacred places, and the light surrounding all the statues of the Queen of Killings dimmed.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night represented a large race in the universe. They lived in hundreds of supreme worlds. They had thousands of tenth-grade sacred places and countless forces. All the members knew that their queen was injured the moment the light from the statues dimmed.</p>

  <p>This was a great event in the Demon Night. The replacement of the queen was almost related to the rise and fall of the race, and Xun had only been in office for one hundred thousand years.</p>

  <p>Soon the Demon Night members found that Xun was still alive because every Xun's statue showed a faint light that hadn't perished.</p>

  <p>The members soon found out the truth. Or maybe it was Yao who had never planned to hide the truth.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was actually controlled by the three queens. The Board of Elders had less influence on them. The three queens had their own followers. Soon, Xun's subordinates were either killed or betrayed their queen.</p>

  <p>When Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth came back, they couldn't reverse the situation.</p>

  <p>Seven hundred years had passed, and the four finally met Xun again. But they were now her enemies. When they heard Xun greeting them, a myriad of emotions flooded them.</p>

  <p>They used to be Xun's subordinates and her closest friends. Yet they betrayed her.</p>

  <p>Salvador stood up slowly. A bitter smile was on his face. He didn't know how to face Xun. His other three companions had the same feelings.</p>

  <p>After Xun left, they had a hard life.</p>

  <p>"My queen, I apologize!" Salvador said solemnly while bowing.</p>

  <p>They still loved their queen, and that love couldn't just disappear even after seven hundred years.</p>

  <p>They didn't want to go against Xun. However, they couldn't disobey Yao's orders, or she would kill all of their families, relatives and friends. They couldn't afford such a miserable faith, so they had to come here.</p>

  <p>Xun sighed heavily. She knew the four well, and she knew they must have come here for some reason. She didn't blame them at all.</p>

  <p>Yao was the Queen of Punishment and a cruel woman. She knew how to manipulate people. Xun knew that Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth wouldn't betray her for their own advantage. It had to be Yao threatening them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and activated the Reincarnation Plate again.</p>

  <p>After Salvador took a bow, he moved the spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had seen the same move many times before. It was Xun's move. She had used it when she was still a weak sword spirit, but the move was very powerful.</p>

  <p>This was the Almighty Spear Technique, the best spear technique in the Demon Night. Only the Queen of Killings could learn the spear technique. Back then, Xun asked for the permission from the Board of Elders to pass on the spear technique to Salvador.</p>

  <p>When Salvador used the spear technique, his power was tens of thousands of times stronger than what Luo Luo Zheng had witnessed before. After all, Salvador's cultivation level was now much higher than Xun's at that time.</p>

  <p>That invisible spear strike stabbed the surface of the Reincarnation Plate, bursting out with a huge noise.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate didn't break, but its surface caved in notably.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other three ran after the Reincarnation Plate and used their own weapons to attack it.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned and didn't say a word. He was focused on controlling the Reincarnation Plate, which moved forward at full speed. Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth chased after the Reincarnation Plate and kept moving forward attacking it.</p>

  <p>Not long after, cracks appeared on the surface of the Reincarnation Plate one after another. No matter how fast the Reincarnation Plate moved forward, it was unable to shake the four off.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The divine textures around Luo Luo Zheng exploded one by one.</p>

  <p>"They are too powerful. The Reincarnation Plate is unable to stop them,"</p>

  <p>Livingston said with a bitter smile. "I'm afraid it will break under their attacks."</p>

  <p>Nervousness was written all over Freya's face. She even tried to hold back her breath in order not to disturb Luo Luo Zheng. She knew she was of little use at this moment. All she could do was keep quiet.</p>

  <p>"Let me out!" Xun suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"No!" Luo Luo Zheng turned her down without hesitation. Xun's soul had recovered 60% and her sword spirit body was more powerful now. She might be able to fight a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior, but she was unable to block a world lord's strike.</p>

  <p>"The Pool of Faith is not sealed yet, so I can stall them for a while longer." After saying that, Xun activated several divine textures around them.</p>

  <p>Holding the Cold Plum Blood Spear, Xun appeared outside the Reincarnation Plate. As soon as she left the Reincarnation Plate, the huge wings formed by the Faith Energy spread on her back. She swung her spear and stood before Salvador.</p>
