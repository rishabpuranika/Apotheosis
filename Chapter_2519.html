<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2519 Leaving The Divine Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng had no idea what had happened inside the cave.</p>

  <p>He sat cross-legged in the stable space and wholeheartedly continued to break through to the top-rank of the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>A series of occurrences happened in his inner world.</p>

  <p>The sword clouds rolled towards his Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Even though there was no more Spiritual Darkness entering his inner world, the brown clouds transformed by the Spiritual Darknesses were more than enough.</p>

  <p>"It seems that Zheng can successfully become a top-rank True God,"</p>

  <p>Lorena said softly.</p>

  <p>The events that happened in the cave were clear to the wisp of Lorena's soul but she didn't reveal anything not to disturb Zheng's concentration.</p>

  <p>A focused Zheng placed all of his thoughts on that Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>The breakthrough on becoming a top-rank True God had unexpectedly taken much longer time.</p>

  <p>Before he knew it, two hours had passed.</p>

  <p>With another roar in his inner world, the entire world once again expanded out.</p>

  <p>"I made it!" Surprise filled Zheng's face as he cried out in success.</p>

  <p>As his inner world expanded, he felt that he had a much deeper comprehension about Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"Mother!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatar rushed towards Lorena.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Zheng." Lorena greeted him with a smile on her face, but was followed by an extremely complicated look on her eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed his mother's strange emotion and couldn't help but ask curiously, "Mother, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The smile on Lorena's face gradually faded away, and she lightly explained, "I'll tell you, but don't panic. After all, this is not a dead end for you."</p>

  <p>Zheng was confused but still nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>"I have sent you to the chaos outside the divine land," Lorena bluntly said.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat as he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Only then did he realize that he was no longer in the cave, but was covered by a purple circle of light.</p>

  <p>He was full of doubts as he once again closed his eyes, and placed his consciousness on his avatar. Back in his inner world, he stared at his mother and eagerly asked, "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"The Holy Beings found me when you were breaking through," Lorena voiced out with bitterness.</p>

  <p>Lorena was afraid of affecting his breakthrough so she didn't bring it up.</p>

  <p>In order to make Zheng understand the situation, she tried her best to explain the events that happened.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Zheng was given a shock and probed, "Who are those Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>"Nicholas and his people," Lorena answered.</p>

  <p>This was probably the last name Zheng wanted to hear.</p>

  <p>Lorena continued, "I have no other choice but to send you out of the divine land. In the chaos, you will constantly fall, and you might encounter the Out-of-Land Fiends, but in the end, you still have a slim chance of survival. If you fall into the Holy Beings' hands, however, you will definitely die."</p>

  <p>This was a quick decision she had to make.</p>

  <p>"How can it be? Mother, how about you?" Zheng's face was now crowded with anxiety.</p>

  <p>Lorena didn't give out any response but simply said, "I'm counting on you to avenge me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng kept shaking his head. He couldn't believe what his mother just said.</p>

  <p>Did his mother mean that she was going to die?</p>

  <p>His heart wrenched as panic was written all over his face. "That's impossible! They haven't found you for so many years. Why this time?</p>

  <p>It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>How could he ever forgive himself if those Holy Beings had found his mother because of him?</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng was already in a state of complete turmoil. He was completely unable to remain calm as he used to be.</p>

  <p>The wisp of Lorena's soul floated lightly as her hands held Zheng's cheeks.</p>

  <p>Her extremely beautiful eyes stared at her own son's eyes. "Zheng, you are already the last hope! Don't let me down!" she said gently.</p>

  <p>It had only been less than a day that she had been together with her son, but they had to part in a life or death situation. This was too ridiculous!</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, didn't move but just stared at his mother. She kept on reminding and rambled about the method of cultivating the Spiritual Darkness and the origins of the Out-of-Land Fiends.</p>

  <p>He was completely still, not a word came through.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Lorena's soul became thin and slowly dissipated in Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>Zheng still didn't move on the same posture, staring blankly ahead.</p>

  <p>He was on a trance for about five minutes until his avatar trembled and gradually scattered. He quickly opened his eyes and took out the token of mountain.</p>

  <p>He would be able to return to the fairy palace as long as he activated the token of mountain whether he was in the universe or in the divine land.</p>

  <p>He wanted to find Harold because Harold might have a solution. Zheng planned to go underground again to save his mother.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he tried to activate the mountain token, nothing happened.</p>

  <p>Zheng continuously tried to activate this token, but the mountain token showed no reaction, like an ordinary iron token. It no longer worked this time.</p>

  <p>After trying a million times with no results, he was already full of anger making him throw the mountain token strongly.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>The solid token flew around in the narrow space.</p>

  <p>The mountain token could be used in both the divine land and the universe. It should also work with Bromley's omnipotent theurgy.</p>

  <p>'Am I really in chaos?' Zheng thought in a daze.</p>

  <p>Taking a glimpse of the outside world was not possible from within the space. He couldn't even feel himself falling. He could only keep still as he sat with his legs crossed.</p>

  <p>His inner world had expanded greatly after he became a top-rank True God but his current situation disturbed his mood to explore.</p>

  <p>More than ten days had already passed since he stayed in the same position but the space which restrained him hadn't changed at all.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he discovered that a crack had appeared in a corner in the space binding him.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the crack appeared, thick brown mist poured in.</p>

  <p>"Is this the chaotic energy?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>An ordinary True God, or even a consummate True God would think that the chaotic energy was extremely poisonous, but it wasn't the same case for Zheng. It wasn't a threat to him because after all, his inner world was made up of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>His mother didn't lie to him. She had indeed sent him out of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Thinking carefully, he realized that his mother's choice at the last moment was right. If she had sent him to any place in the divine land, perhaps Nicholas could track him down instantly with the Holy Being's power.</p>

  <p>The time he left the Time Sea and was taken away by Joy, Nicholas couldn't track his location. It was because of Estelle's action which he was grateful for.</p>

  <p>Joy on the other hand, to prevent them from being caught up, still took Zheng to move thousands of times in a short time.</p>

  <p>His mother then could only send him out of the divine land. This was her only choice.</p>

  <p>"Mother, I don't think you will definitely die this time!" A light flashed across Zheng's eyes. "Maybe there's still a chance for everything, but the premise is that I must have enough strength!"</p>

  <p>He had been down and depressed for ten days, but he finally became resolute as his mood was adjusted.</p>

  <p>He observed as the crack in the space that fettered him gradually became wider. He could finally take a look at the situation outside.</p>

  <p>Zheng could see a huge oval-shaped gem floating above him.</p>

  <p>He could almost recognize at a glance that it was the true form of the divine land. A red ribbon could be seen binding the gem.</p>

  <p>He grasped and understood from his location that he was already quite far away from the divine land. He didn't know when he would fall at the bottom of the chaos.</p>
