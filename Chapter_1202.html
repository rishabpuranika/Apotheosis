  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng gazed at the arched door of the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land in silence.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, there were hidden mysteries on the other side of the arched door. It was not easy to pass through it. However, it was not the first time that the four rulers had explored the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. They certainly must have methods to deal with it.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Turner and War King Wind stepped forward. They did not barge through the arched door immediately, instead, they walked over to the sides.</p>

  <p>The two of them took out two red dragon-shaped keys from their space rings and inserted them into the small holes on either end of the arched door. Nodding to each other, they turned the key at the same time.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The jarring sound of shifting gears sounded, and Turner and War King Wind retreated at the same time. They saw the huge arched door slowly begin to rotate.</p>

  <p>The dragon-shaped door spun three times. The red light reflecting in the eyes of the dragon sculpture at the top of the door extinguished quietly.</p>

  <p>Following this, a jade-green light rose in its eyes and a transmission door appeared in the center of the arc.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sudden appearance of the door, Zheng was slightly stunned. A clouded expression entered his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was located right behind the transmission door. Why did they have to go through this door to reach there? Wasn't that unnecessary?</p>

  <p>Turner noticed Zheng's surprised gaze and said, "The Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place that you see is just an illusion. There are dangers aplenty inside. If you were to enter through it, only death would await you! In the past, many people from the four divine kingdoms have been fooled by the illusion, and a lot of them have died."</p>

  <p>"Illusion…" Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>The beautiful and life-like city before him was an illusion. Zheng was a little surprised at this revelation. It had obviously been created in order to mislead the invaders. If they had entered this illusion without knowing about it, they would only have had a slim chance of surviving.</p>

  <p>"Only through this transmission door can we enter the real Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. It has been opened now. Let's go inside." Without wasting any more time, the powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm entered the transmission door in succession.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and followed the others through the door.</p>

  <p>After a short period of space transmission, an azure-colored city appeared in Zheng's field of vision.</p>

  <p>The entire city looked as if it had been carved out of crystal. The edges of both the giant and smaller buildings reflected a jade-blue crystal light.</p>

  <p>The city looked as if it had been pulled right out of a fairyland from someone's dream. Everything seemed unreal.</p>

  <p>"It's so beautiful!" Fiona couldn't help but cry out in praise as the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place revealed itself before her eyes.</p>

  <p>Beside her, Randy nodded. "It is indeed beautiful. I'm more than willing to believe that this city is an illusion, not the one that we just saw!"</p>

  <p>Pausing at the gates of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place for a while to marvel at the view, they walked ahead along the main road of the city.</p>

  <p>The seven divine kingdoms and the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place had been established almost at the same time centuries ago. In the beginning, the Dragon Lineage Humans and the human race did not have anything to do with each other.</p>

  <p>The two races did not even know of each other's existence.</p>

  <p>However, as the number of powerful warriors in the divine kingdoms and the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place increased, the warriors of the Dragon Lineage Human began to expand their territory and population beyond the Feather Holy Sea. As for the seven divine kingdoms' martial artists, they too began to explore the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>It was at this time that the two races first made contact.</p>

  <p>At the start, when the human race had just reached out to the Dragon Lineage Humans, they had been friendly, but this peaceful state lasted less than ten years.</p>

  <p>The racial barriers soon made them turn against each other. What happened next was a war that spanned across tens of thousands of years.</p>

  <p>During the war, the strength of the seven divine kingdoms and Dragon Lineage Human rose rapidly.</p>

  <p>Even though the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place had been fighting the seven divine kingdoms all alone, they were not at a disadvantage. On the contrary, the seven divine kingdoms had always lost out against the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most important reason for that was the Dragon Soar Arena that the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place had been in possession of. Almost all Dragon Lineage Human tribes in the Lower World had their own Dragon Soar Arenas.</p>

  <p>It was known that only powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm could enter the ascending passageway and rise to the Upper World. If they had access to the Dragon Soar Arena, it would have been a different case.</p>

  <p>Through the arena, all of them could freely send warriors of the younger generation to the Upper World to practice and learn their craft.</p>

  <p>Long ago, Zheng had made a trip to the Upper World through the Dragon Soar Arena. After returning to the Lower World, he fought the talents in the Central Region and always emerged the victor. The arena had been of great help to him.</p>

  <p>Because of their advantage of the Dragon Soar Arena, the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place had developed a lot more rapidly than the seven divine kingdoms. By the time the seven divine kingdoms had come to possess quasi-seventh grade power, the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place had already become an eighth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>With the fast speed at which the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place developed, it was only a matter of time before the entire Divine Kingdom Continent was annexed by them. Later, with the help of the secret sect, the human race of the Upper World opened up the Reverse Spirit Channel and often came to the aid of the seven divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The seven divine kingdoms which had the Reverse Spirit Channel on their side, finally had the confidence to wage a decisive war against the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place. Thus, the grand war went on in full operation.</p>

  <p>The battle was known in the history of the seven divine kingdoms as the 'Dragon Lineage Human Massacre'. It lasted for more than a hundred years, and in the end, three of the seven divine kingdoms had been annihilated. The Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place used the lives in their sacred land to seal the Feather Holy Sea in a blood sacrifice.</p>

  <p>There were also countless treasures hidden and left behind in the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place after the war. To obtain them, the four divine kingdoms had explored the place for a number of years, and innumerable people had died within the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>After numerous trials, they had finally managed to access the other three secret lands and find a way to enter the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the inheritance of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, the four divine kingdoms grew rapidly. However, During the Dragon Lineage Human Massacre, the ascending passageway was destroyed and no one in this great world could ascend to the Upper World anymore.</p>

  <p>Many powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were thus trapped in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>So it was natural that some of the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were always morose every time someone mentioned their circumstance. They would rather that the Dragon Lineage Human Massacre had never happened, and that they had never inherited anything from the Dragon Lineage Human. Now, their only hope was that the ascending passage had not been destroyed.</p>

  <p>After all, what did they gain from the many treasures of the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land? In the end, they were stuck at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>When their lifespans ran out, they would eventually die and turn to ashes. Soaring to the Upper World was absolutely out of the question!</p>

  <p>This was the past of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place…</p>

  <p>Now, everything here seemed to have frozen over time. The windows were still open and the doors unlocked. A few flying chariots were scattered over the roofs of houses.</p>

  <p>Back in the age, Dragon Lineage Human preferred death over dishonor and practiced blood sacrifice using billions of lives of the race. The vast majority of the clansmen had not known about this decision. When the blood sacrifice began, the clansmen turned into clouds of bloody mist within seconds. Not even a bone was left behind. The blood mist gradually became the golden spell of blood sacrifice and spread all over the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the entire place was sealed up under the spell for a number of years until the four divine kingdoms explored the sites and entered the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Clop-clop!</p>

  <p>Eighty to ninety martial artists in the four divine kingdoms had entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place this time. With such a large group walking into the empty city, they could all hear the echo of their footsteps. The sound made several youngsters especially vigilant.</p>

  <p>Seeing Fiona, Callan and a few others so nervous, War King Wind laughed. "Children, don't be afraid. The danger of Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place cannot be found here. This is just an empty city. We've been here so many times before, but we've never encountered another living being."</p>

  <p>Indeed, because of the spell of the blood sacrifice, there were no living creatures anymore in the Feather Holy Sea. All the way through the sea and the three secret lands, Zheng had only discovered one person who could be considered sort-of alive, and that was Brianna's body— which he had occupied.</p>

  <p>However, because Brianna's soul had been locked up, it had separated from her body. In a sense, she was like the living dead, a zombie.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Fiona smiled and nodded. The empty sacred land made her feel cautious and she did not know why. She could not help but feel jittery.</p>

  <p>However, the very next second, she heard the sound of rustling, like a wild beast was chewing on some bones.</p>

  <p>Crack... Crack...</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Hearing the strange sound, Fiona stiffened. She immediately stopped in her tracks, her gaze sweeping over her surroundings. But the sound soon stopped.</p>
