<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't speak for quite a while after slowing down the time flow rate.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey studied the two Sanskrit words in this quiet space.</p>

  <p>To him, each stroke of the Sanskrit words contained a wide meaning.</p>

  <p>The more complicated the word was, the more meaning it contained.</p>

  <p>There had been countless decipherers since ancient times to the present.</p>

  <p>Almost all of them had to rack their brains to exclude the wrong interpretations and determine the correct one.</p>

  <p>Besides, it was usually difficult to decipher a word when dozens of wrong interpretations were to be excluded.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Geoffrey seemed to be born with a talent of easily excluding the Sanskrit word's wrong interpretations. He could read simple Sanskrit words almost without thinking.</p>

  <p>But these two Sanskrit words were far more complicated than the others.</p>

  <p>Each pattern had more than a thousand interpretations.</p>

  <p>Rooting out the correct one from more than a thousand wrong interpretations was an impossible task for most decipherers.</p>

  <p>Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi hadn't been able to decipher the Sanskrit words on the yellow paper.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was a naughty man, but once he was immersed in something, he became serious in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Two hours passed...</p>

  <p>Four hours passed...</p>

  <p>One day passed...</p>

  <p>Two days passed...</p>

  <p>For six consecutive days, Geoffrey remained unmoving. He stared at the Sanskrit words, his eyes bloodshot.</p>

  <p>His mind was working frantically, at a high speed, and this caused Geoffrey to consume a lot of soul power. In anticipation of this process, Luo Zheng had given him several pills that could increase his soul power.</p>

  <p>But for the past six days, he hadn't deciphered a single word. Instead, he was trying to find out the rule behind the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>On the seventh day, Geoffrey's tired, gloomy eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

  <p>Every pattern in a Sanskrit word had more than a thousand interpretations.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of patterns formed a Sanskrit word. As a result, there were tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of interpretations. Geoffrey had finally captured the rule within these countless interpretations!</p>

  <p>And then, combined with the other patterns, Geoffrey inferred the correct interpretation hidden in the Sanskrit words, little by little.</p>

  <p>"It should be like this!" Geoffrey said excitedly. "This word is right after the first six Sanskrit words."</p>

  <p>He then recited the interpretation of the Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey recited the first four words, however, sharp light suddenly appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>An invisible sword radiance suddenly shot out of his head and broke the enchanted barrier that Luo Zheng had set up.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate within the enchanted barrier was different from the one outside of it. Spots of light appeared as the different time flow rates bumped and rubbed against each other.</p>

  <p>This caused Geoffrey's eyes to roll back into his head and he fell to the ground in a faint.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted, shocked.</p>

  <p>As the creator of his inner world, Luo Zheng could control everything within it.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier he had created could imprison even Evil God, no matter how talented he was. But the truth aura that Geoffrey had released had broken Luo Zheng's enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The power hidden in the truth aura was very small, but abnormally sharp.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's soul was not weak, but it couldn't resist the truth aura.</p>

  <p>The moment Geoffrey fell to the ground, Yudie, who was cultivating in the fairy palace, opened her eyes, panicking.</p>

  <p>She had asked Luo Zheng to help her make a Life Lamp for Geoffrey in order to ensure the safety of her son.</p>

  <p>She knew now that her son had lost consciousness.</p>

  <p>With a cracking sound, Yudie crushed a token into pieces.</p>

  <p>The token around Geoffrey's waist broke as well. Two space doors appeared beside Yudie and Geoffrey respectively.</p>

  <p>Yudie passed through the door and appeared through the one beside Geoffrey. She saw him lying motionless on the ground, and was filled with fear. "Geoffrey!" she shouted. "What's wrong? What happened to you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng put his hand on Geoffrey's head, checking on him. "His soul was cut in half," he said, his voice low.</p>

  <p>"What? What should we do now?" Yudie said, her face contorting at this news.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't say anything. He was sensing the degree of Geoffrey's soul damage.</p>

  <p>The potential of one's soul was much greater than that of one's body, and many people would cut their souls themselves and cause a soul avatar. But they had to be very careful because the slightest carelessness could cause irreversible damage to their souls.</p>

  <p>The truth aura that had cut Geoffrey's soul was very weak, so it hadn't hurt his soul severely. His soul might be a little damaged, but it wasn't something to worry about.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's perception, the two parts of Geoffrey's soul began to merge together.</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be a problem," Luo Zheng comforted his wife. "Let's go back to the fairy palace first."</p>

  <p>The three of them disappeared from the spot and appeared in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The scene with Geoffrey just now had really frightened Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Cultivating the Truth of Godly Way did exert a great pressure on one's soul.</p>

  <p>Under such high pressure, the most that should have happened was Geoffrey unable to recite the words and passing out. But his soul shouldn't have been cut in half.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng comforted Yudie that Geoffrey was fine, she still scolded him for a long time. She had always been of the opinion that he shouldn't have involved Geoffrey in such a dangerous task.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only smiled bitterly at her. He understood his wife's nervousness.</p>

  <p>It was not until an hour later that Geoffrey finally woke up. Yudie heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey didn't feel any pain when he woke up. His first concern was the yellow paper. "Father, this is more dangerous than the Truth of Cultivation Nature. I'm afraid I can't recite the translation, but I can write it down."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had used this method in the divine land to write down the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way was set to a special "rhythm." If it was recited in this rhythm, it could draw the power of the Sea of Truth. But if one did not follow this rhythm, reciting the words would be pretty easy.</p>

  <p>"Come on! You almost lost your life!" Yudie admonished him.</p>

  <p>"So? It took me a lot of effort to decipher them!" Geoffrey had indeed put in a lot of thought and effort to decipher the Sanskrit words. It was obvious that he didn't want to waste his efforts.</p>

  <p>He then dipped his brush into ink and began to write the words, one by one, looking back and forth at the Sanskrit words on the yellow paper.</p>

  <p>To be safe, he covered every word he wrote with a black cloth after he was done, in case he began to recite them subconsciously and release the sharp truth aura again.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, Geoffrey finished writing. The process was smooth.</p>

  <p>He carefully rolled up the paper and handed it to Luo Zheng. "Father, I don't know what it is, but if you want to cultivate it, you have to be more cautious!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was moved by his son's words. He had grown up into a caring son after cultivating in his inner world for a while.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, you are so considerate. Don't you want a reward this time?" Luo Zheng suddenly asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"A reward?" Geoffrey blinked. He thought about it for a while before saying, "If Rosa and I become consummate True Gods, can we leave your inner world?"</p>

  <p>Rosa was the Holy Maiden of the Flower Dancing Sect.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was the strongest warrior in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>He had to leave Luo Zheng's inner world if he wanted to improve his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Yudie's face darkened at his words. "No way!"</p>
