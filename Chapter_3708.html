<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the forces in different stages of the Other Shore had different structures.</p>

  <p>For instance, the ruling civilizations were considered as the supreme forces in some stages, just like the Abyss Spirit race that dominated Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In some stages, the native races on the Other Shore became the rulers.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning, the Element Spirit race had tried to rule the Other Shore. They also had a plan about the stage rulers, especially since the Dark Region had appeared. They wanted to occupy all the nineteen stages of the Desire World and make sure that they would control the ruler in each stage.</p>

  <p>It was a good plan. During their peak, nearly thirteen of the nineteen stage rulers belonged to the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>However, what the Element Spirit race did was an offense to everyone else.</p>

  <p>By the time the Dark Region had appeared, the Other Shore was already a very perfect world. Many of the ruling civilizations that escaped from the chaos were not easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>The high pressure on the Element Spirit race was what eventually broke them. At the same time, there were other races such as the Nihility race that attacked them. Now, only six stage rulers were completely under the Element Spirit race's control.</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore, the Eternal Prohibition Stage, was under the control of the Element Spirit race. However, the higher the stage was, the more the larger races would restrain themselves.</p>

  <p>Although the stage ruler of the Eternal Prohibition Stage was from the Element Spirit race, in the past few years, the Element Spirit race had rarely interfered in the travel of other races on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After many races had resisted in their last attempt, the Element Spirit race realized that they could only control the Other Shore if they did it step by step. Hindering the development of the other ruling civilizations or completely destroying them would have adverse effects.</p>

  <p>Such a strategy conceptualized after reflection was effective. Under the continuous influence of the Element Spirit race, many races and ruling civilizations on the Other Shore were willing to or were forced to join them.</p>

  <p>Now, there were very few races that could oppose the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Recently, there had been some changes in the Eternal Prohibition Stage.</p>

  <p>More and more Moon Fire Slaves descended from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As the strongest fighters of the Element Spirit race, the Moon Fire Slaves were undoubtedly a powerful force.</p>

  <p>Therefore the races of the Other Shore that lived in Stage Twenty-eight felt uneasy at their presence.</p>

  <p>Numerous mountains were everywhere in the Eternal Prohibition Stage.</p>

  <p>They were so many that if one looked down at them from the sky, they looked like a herd of elephants looking for food. In the center of the mountains was a huge basin, where the only structure was the big city in the Eternal Prohibition Stage— the Forbidden Rain City.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng, who carried Elvinia on his back, floated high up in the sky and observed the Forbidden Rain City.</p>

  <p>"The Dark Region in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore is so small..." he commented.</p>

  <p>In the center of the large city was only a beam of black light. The Dark Region looked particularly weak in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's because Stage Twenty-eight is not important. This beam of black light must be a passageway to the Dark Region," Elvinia deduced.</p>

  <p>Recently, Elvinia became very rational and had a detailed understanding of the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Back then, she didn't want to face her past. Now, she realized that she belonged to the Oneness Sky Palace and was a real human being. Even if she couldn't save her father, she could still do something for the Oneness Sky Palace. She couldn't just be an incompetent member of royalty who couldn't do anything but watch the Oneness Sky Palace decline.</p>

  <p>"The star ring within Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore should be in the northwest," she said.</p>

  <p>"We can get to the Soul City after we've passed through the star ring," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the two of them climbed up the stages of the Other Shore at a great speed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Elvinia became more cautious. "The entire Stage Twenty-eight is under the control of the Element Spirit race. If we want to pass through it, we must be careful. Thus Master Pearce has sent someone to pick us up at the gate of the Forbidden Rain City," she said.</p>

  <p>It was known that Zheng had caught the attention of the Element Spirit race several times.</p>

  <p>After all, he had killed the stage ruler in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore and opened the Creation Myth Temple in Stage Seventeen. If the members of the Element Spirit race weren't fools, of course they would stop Zheng from entering the star ring.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>They crossed countless mountains, and finally arrived at the edge of the Forbidden Rain City.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because the Element Spirit race had controlled the entire Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore, the Forbidden Rain City didn't guard against the creatures that came in and out of the city. There weren't even any guards who watched over the city gate.</p>

  <p>But for some reason, Zheng and Elvinia caught the attention of the creatures from the Other Shore the moment they arrived.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng became vigilant. He didn't believe that their attention was out of kind concern.</p>

  <p>A human Soul of Light stood by the side of the city gate, and quietly approached Zheng and Elvinia when they showed up. Then, he lowered his voice and said, "Are you Princess Elvinia?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Elvinia answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm Doyle Zhuo. Let's talk outside the city," said Doyle Zhuo.</p>

  <p>He was a member on the third floor of the Land of Sword Grief. Zheng had seen him twice before, but they had never talked to each other.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and Elvinia saw the mysterious look on Doyle's face, they also lowered their heads and followed him out of the city gate. After they found a secluded place, Doyle Zhuo said, "Elder Pearce asked me to lead you to the Constant Glory Stage.</p>

  <p>I have been observing in the Forbidden Rain City these days." "How is everything going in the city?" Elvinia asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite a few Moon Fire Slaves recently came here. There weren't a lot of them here before, until now. They might come over to take action against the two of you," Doyle Zhuo answered.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Zheng and Elvinia frowned at the same time.</p>

  <p>They had already witnessed how strong the Moon Fire Slaves were, but at that time, the Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore had greatly restrained the power of the Moon Fire Slaves. Now that they were in Stage Twenty-eight, they could demonstrate far greater power.</p>

  <p>"Are they only targeting us? How about the other Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"No," Doyle Zhuo said and shook his head. He looked at Elvinia and continued, "Both of you came here with your physical bodies, and your face is clear, Princess Elvinia.</p>

  <p>You can't pass through the star ring openly without alerting the Moon Fire Slaves!" "Then what should we do?" Elvinia asked as her beautiful eyes narrowed into slits.</p>

  <p>Zheng also lowered his head in silence.</p>

  <p>If the star ring was really heavily guarded, there would be no other decent way except for breaking into the star ring as he did in Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"But this time, there are creatures from other races that are willing to help,"</p>

  <p>Doyle Zhuo said out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"Who are willing to help?" Elvinia asked curiously. "The Ear Mouse race," replied Doyle Zhuo with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Elder Pearce has spent a lot of soul pills on the cooperation with the Ear Mouse race. You can go to the star ring through the underground passageway outside the Forbidden Rain City," he explained.</p>

  <p>The mouse races on the Other Shore were always considered as strong and formidable beings, and most of them had a good relationship with the Ear Mouse race.</p>

  <p>Yet, Elvinia just rolled her eyes at Doyle Zhuo's answer. Since he was already prepared, he could just come straight to the point. Why did he have to beat around the bush now?</p>

  <p>It was true that he came all the way from Stage Twenty-nine to meet with Elvinia, so she didn't say much. There was only a slight hint of dissatisfaction in her voice as she said, "Then please lead the way!"</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng and Elvinia, under Doyle Zhuo's lead, traveled to the front of the mountain nearest to the Forbidden Rain City.</p>

  <p>On one side of the mountain was a naturally formed cave. Several huge mice guarded the cave's entrance.</p>
