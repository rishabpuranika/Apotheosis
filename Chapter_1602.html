<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1602 How Many Life Vitality Crystals </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Here in the Pure Jade Sacred Place of the Three Purities World, the Clear Spirit Force House was the core place for cultivation.</p>

  <p>It was a place where only the most talented disciples had access to.</p>

  <p>But the talented disciples at the Soul Sea Realm were currently in the Illusion Battlefield which meant that the Clear Spirit Force House had been left mostly empty.</p>

  <p>Not today though. Today, the main hall of the Clear Spirit Force House was bustling with energy as numerous Life and Death Realm and Spirit Supreme Realm warriors gathered together.</p>

  <p>Their excitement was tantamount as they waited for the results of the Illusion Battlefield competitions.</p>

  <p>The stakes were high and everyone waited in bated breath as the names changed in ranking on the pyramid located at the roof of the hall. The Clear Spirit Force House was the gathering place for the strongest warriors here in the Pure Jade Sacred Place so everyone had high expectations for their own homegrown talents.</p>

  <p>"Josiah's ranking has improved. He's at the 220, 000th now!"</p>

  <p>"It might be possible for him to get up to the top 100, 000..."</p>

  <p>"He's really lived up to everyone's expectations."</p>

  <p>There were 100, 000 supreme worlds and each of them owned three tenth-grade sacred places averagely...</p>

  <p>Josiah Shen was the most outstanding warrior in the entire Pure Jade Sacred Place and they all rooted for him to get to the top 100, 000.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the disciples who came to watch, even the Saint Lord of the Pure Jade Sacred Place came to observe the talents' rankings.</p>

  <p>The grand hall, which the pyramid floated on top of, was the only Illusion Space within the entire sacred place.</p>

  <p>This Illusion Space required quite a large amount of life vitality to operate.</p>

  <p>Life Vitality would only be consumed if there were warriors in the Illusion Space but ever since the appearance of the pyramid, the space now needed a constant supply of life vitality.</p>

  <p>There were two methods to replenish life vitality here in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>One was through the use of life vitality crystals or jades, which wasn't really economical since a huge amount was needed. The second, and more economical method was to have warriors directly supply the life vitality with their bodies.</p>

  <p>There were countless warriors in this boundless universe.</p>

  <p>As long as a considerable number of warriors gathered together, they would be able to continuously absorb the vitality between heaven and earth and transform it into life vitality. This life vitality could then be utilized to power the Illusion Space and keep it functioning.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Illusion Spaces, even some large-scale divine texture arrays operated this way.</p>

  <p>Thousands of people were gathered behind the grand hall, constantly pouring life vitality onto the divine textures below them. These divine textures served as a sort of purifier that erased the warriors' marks and mixed all the life vitality together to power the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>If there was not sufficient life vitality, then the Illusion Space would gradually dissipate and the pyramid would also disappear.</p>

  <p>"Alas. Although I don't need to dig mines, I have to absorb vitality and supply it to the Illusion Space all the time. When can I stop doing such a boring thing?" a woman in red complained loudly.</p>

  <p>Yudie sat beside her, her hands also placed on the divine texture. "Our strength is still not enough to qualify in entering the Clear Spirit Force House. Supplying the life vitality here is better than mining..."</p>

  <p>After ascending to the Upper World, Yudie was immediately summoned by a master of the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>This master, almost at the world lord level, had every intention of selecting a disciple but Yudie didn't really have a good feeling about it.</p>

  <p>Of course, she was right. The master introduced this so-called "male-female dual cultivation method" and claimed that it was as remarkable as the Transcendent Divine Might. He also told them that it would bring them great benefits later on.</p>

  <p>The only reason she was able to get out of it was that it required the female warrior to be a virgin.</p>

  <p>Yudie was already a married woman and it was thanks to that fact that she was able to get out of such a fishy arrangement.</p>

  <p>Still, she couldn't really avoid the suffering. Yudie was supposed to mine after her ascension but since she had already been brought here, she was sent to work in powering the Illusion Space instead.</p>

  <p>She sat at the back of the grand hall all day, absorbing vitality from the heaven and earth before pouring it into the divine texture for purification.</p>

  <p>It didn't necessarily harm the body but it was extremely boring.</p>

  <p>"Those who can be recruited in the Clear Spirit Force House are the core disciples of the sacred place... It is wishful thinking for us to enter it!"</p>

  <p>The woman in red pouted, "It would've been better to be taken in as that master's disciple. At least there would've been a chance for me to become famous in the Upper World! It's a pity he didn't choose me!"</p>

  <p>The male-female dual cultivation method did not necessarily deter every warrior. On the contrary, it was often a good shortcut for female disciples to quickly improve their cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Yudie smiled. "I wonder if my husband has the qualifications to enter this Clear Spirit Force House..."</p>

  <p>"Your husband? Forget that fancy dream! There are a lot of Soul Sea Realm warriors here in this tenth-grade sacred place. The only ones who can get in are the most outstanding core disciples of the Pure Jade Sacred Place!" the woman in red sneered.</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>A whip suddenly slashed between the two of them.</p>

  <p>"More work! Less talk! Or I'll send you two back to the mine!" the fat woman scolded.</p>

  <p>The whip did not necessarily hurt them, but the airwaves were enough to make it feel as though their faces were struck by sharp knives.</p>

  <p>Yudie did not let her anger show on her face, but her eyes noticeably hid a cold frost within them.</p>

  <p>But she had to reign it in. Right now, she was stuck here doing forced labor.</p>

  <p>She neither had the strength nor talent to fight back against these bullies.</p>

  <p>All she could do was to endure.</p>

  <p>Not talking wasn't really a strict rule when supplying life vitality. There was no need for visualization or meditation to do their job. The fat woman was really just being insufferable to not allow them to speak with each other.</p>

  <p>The woman seemed to have sensed the coldness in Yudie's eyes. "What?</p>

  <p>Why are you staring at me like that?"</p>

  <p>Yudie huffed but turned her fair face away. "Nothing."</p>

  <p>"I heard something interesting. You flew up to the Upper World in search of your husband, right? Is he also someone who ascended to the Upper World?" the fat woman asked.</p>

  <p>Yudie ignored her question and pretended that she didn't hear.</p>

  <p>"You are so childish and stupid. The Upper World is so big, so who knows where your husband is. Moreover, he's just a nobody. He's probably still stuck in the mine of some sacred place somewhere!" the fat woman chided.</p>

  <p>Yudie knew she only said this to rile her up but she also couldn't help but think that there was some inkling of truth in her words.</p>

  <p>A Soul Sea Realm warrior was much more efficient in mining than the average person, but even they would have to spend a significant amount of time digging more than one million supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>It usually took them dozens of years, sometimes even hundreds.</p>

  <p>Yudie couldn't help but slump in sorrow.</p>

  <p>She hated the fact that this woman might be right, that finding Zheng was going to be as difficult as looking for a needle in a haystack, and that she might never see him again.</p>

  <p>The fat woman, noticing the despair on Yudie's face, had the last laugh as she walked away.</p>

  <p>Yudie went back to her work transferring the vitality into the divine texture but her eyes were noticeably sadder.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, a loud voice suddenly resounded in her ears.</p>

  <p>"More than 16 warriors of the Thoughtless Minds are ranked in the top 100. This is something worth celebrating!"</p>

  <p>The loud declaration startled her.</p>

  <p>The warriors all over the universe had been so focused on the Illusion Battlefield competition that no one had taken the time to use a Roaring Token. This was the first time she heard someone use it.</p>

  <p>"T-That voice... Just where did it come from?" she asked half in panic and half in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"It's from a Roaring Token," a warrior beside her said. "It's something that can be used to transmit sound throughout the entire universe..." This warrior was not someone who ascended from the Lower World and was delegated to such a banal task for some other reason, so he naturally knew about Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>"Roaring Token?" The words sounded familiar but she couldn't quite place where she heard them before. Nevertheless, her eyes lit up upon a sudden realization. If she could get her hands on a Roaring Token, then she might be able to contact Zheng and tell him where she was!</p>

  <p>If she called out for him then he would definitely set out to look for her!</p>

  <p>"The Roaring Token is so magical! How many life vitality crystals would it cost to buy one?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She wasn't a fool. Before she ascended, she already made a lot of preparations and made sure to take around 200, 000 supreme life vitality crystals with her.</p>

  <p>However, the warrior suddenly started laughing. "How many life vitality crystals? Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Yudie frowned, not really knowing what was so funny.</p>
