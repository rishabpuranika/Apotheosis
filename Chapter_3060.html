<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pulled by the tug of the water tornado, Zheng soon fell into the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>When he looked down on the seabed, he saw the candlelight flicker continuously.</p>

  <p>He had been through this before, but the only difference was that the candlelight was yellow. It could have been possible that the whirlpool had been dyed.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if green bats surround this candle as well, ' Zheng thought to himself as he stared at the candle from a distance.</p>

  <p>But as Zheng approached the candle, he suddenly grew more cautious and serious.</p>

  <p>The green bats were known to be powerful souls but posed no threat to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even so, he still didn't lower his guard for he didn't know what dangers the green bats had in store for him.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached his hand out to touch the candle. Out of nowhere, several rays of green light burst out of the space around him. Four green bats emerged from the darkness shrouding the candlelight!</p>

  <p>However, he knew better this time. Without hesitation, he ripped these soul creatures into pieces with his strong arms.</p>

  <p>Just like what he did last time, he reached out his hand and extinguished the candlelight. Afterwards, the tornado at the surface of the sea vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Anyone observing the surface of the sea would notice that the dyed sea water was no longer hindered by the big whirlpool. Instead, it now surged in all directions quickly, spreading out the color yellow in the water.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the Ear Mouse managed to escape from the large whirlpool, too.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed with excitement, the Ear Mouse could not help but express its emotions in its own language as its small Truth Boat circled around Dorothy.</p>

  <p>After circling Dorothy for a few times, the Ear Mouse stopped moving.</p>

  <p>Staring at Dorothy, it asked, "Hey! Why are you not cooperating with me?</p>

  <p>Come on, this will be a profitable business! You see, a lot of people get trapped in the great whirlpools. If we work together and help them out, we can earn more than 15 million divine crystals!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse race was rich because they were all good at finding ways on how to make money.</p>

  <p>However, Dorothy replied indifferently, "We've already helped you out. We have no business with you. You are free to go now."</p>

  <p>"Please reconsider! Think about it, this will be a great partnership between the Origin Mountain and us!" The Ear Mouse continued to persuade Dorothy despite her disinterest.</p>

  <p>With Ear Mouse's persuasiveness, Dorothy was annoyed. She stared at the surface of the sea and began to feel anxious.</p>

  <p>She was sure that Zheng would have given the candle to her if he had finished what he was doing. However, there was still no sign of him. 'Did he encounter any unexpected danger at the bottom of the sea?' Dorothy thought.</p>

  <p>"I have no interest in cooperating with you. Get out of here! Scram!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy shouted as her aura slowly became cold and dangerous due to the anxiety that she felt. She did not hide the fierce killing intent that radiated from her soul.</p>

  <p>Seeing Dorothy's sudden aggression, the Ear Mouse was taken aback. It did not understand why Dorothy had acted up all of a sudden. Disappointed by her refusal, the Ear Mouse frowned as it drove its Truth Boat away from Dorothy. However, its spirit was still high as it did not have any plans on giving up on its business.</p>

  <p>After the Ear Mouse receded from Dorothy's view, she heard a splashing sound behind her. Turning around to see what it was, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Did everything go well?" she asked in a relaxed manner.</p>

  <p>Throwing the candle onto Dorothy's Truth Boat, Zheng smiled and asked,</p>

  <p>"Yes, everything went well. But why did the Ear Mouse keep pestering you? What was that all about?"</p>

  <p>Frowning, Dorothy replied, "It wants to do business with us by solving the other big whirlpools."</p>

  <p>"Even if I want to do this type of business, I certainly won't need to cooperate with an Ear Mouse," Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>He did not have the slightest idea on what powerful creatures were responsible for putting the candles at the bottom of the Sea of Truth. But according to his estimation, he could steal maybe around three or four candles without being noticed. Adding more to this would probably catch the attention of the mysterious beings and would most likely get him in trouble.</p>

  <p>"Not to worry, I already refused and drove it away," Dorothy said showing her sweet smile.</p>

  <p>"Hey, wait for me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed as his body exited from the Sea of Truth. Afterwards, he returned with his Soul of Light and his Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>Now that he had settled down in the Dragon City, he did not need to think about his survival. With the help of the resources from the Oneness Sky Palace, Zheng was bound to rapidly improve his cultivation base.</p>

  <p>After Dorothy gave the candle to Zheng, there was nothing left to do but face the depths of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the endless Dark Region, a tentacle slowly moved in the bottom of the swamp.</p>

  <p>It moved and wiggled its way until it broke through the mud. As this happened, there was a flicker of light that shone through the swamp. This light, however, was a silver white candle.</p>

  <p>In fact, light was regarded as the most valuable substance in the Dark Region instead of the usual soul pills.</p>

  <p>Because darkness engulfed the endless swamp, a single light of a candle was deemed to be precious. Whenever a candlelight was seen flickering, almost all kinds of creatures, including bats, mosquitoes, insects, and bugs would come together and rush over to the light as if they were being pulled by magnets.</p>

  <p>These light hungry creatures were soul creatures, but were generally stronger than the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>However, the candlelight could cause these soul creatures harm. As soon as one of them approached the light, they would be immediately ignited and burnt into ashes. But even if this was their fate, they still came to the light one after another.</p>

  <p>Tup!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the tentacle in the swamp kept on moving until it slapped the air unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>The candlelight was surrounded by a white circle that blocked the annoying soul creatures outside.</p>

  <p>Not long after, another figure appeared just around the white circle.</p>

  <p>This figure, however, turned out to be a woman in human form. On her back, she had a pair of large and beautiful butterfly wings which emphasized her slim figure. The woman was so noticeable that even in darkness, she was clearly seen by every creature.</p>

  <p>"Master Snape, why did you summon me?" the woman asked softly as she hungrily stared at the candlelight.</p>

  <p>"Are you aware that two candles were extinguished during the past month?" a strange and loud voice echoed from the bottom of the murky swamp.</p>

  <p>The woman got curious as she thought about how she would answer the question. After a while, she replied with another question, "Was there a huge storm in the sea?"</p>

  <p>"None that I know of," the strange voice responded.</p>

  <p>"Well, that seems to be pretty odd." The woman couldn't figure out any other reason for this big flaw. It was known that once a Soul of Light entered the Sea of Truth, it would soon be shattered into nothingness. 'Who could possibly extinguish the candles?' she thought to herself in bewilderment. Wanting to get to the bottom of the issue, she followed up with another question, "Do you want me to send someone to investigate this problem?"</p>

  <p>"That would be unnecessary. We have already arranged so many candles. At the end of the day, it's inevitable for accidents to happen. But you need to be quick. There is no time to waste," the strange voice urged.</p>

  <p>"We are on the same page. We want to be faster, but the candles don't seem to be enough at the moment," the woman said as her face was painted in frustration.</p>

  <p>"Thousands of candles have been made in the hall. To ease your burden, I will ask them to send the candles to you at once," the strange voice replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the woman could not help but smile from ear to ear out of joy,</p>

  <p>"Yes, Master Snape!" She then added, "But Master Snape, in order to seal off the Sea of Truth, it would involve millions, or even over tens of millions of candles. As of now, the number is far from enough, and it even couldn't cause them any trouble. In fact, those low-level creatures even learned to dye the great whirlpools!"</p>

  <p>A few moments ago, she noticed that most of the large whirlpools in the Sea of Truth were not in their usual color. Looking more closely at them, she found out that the big whirlpools had been intentionally dyed to warn people to stay away from them.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Don't mind them. These are all meaningless actions. Besides, we aren't the only ones responsible for putting up the candles. Just do as you are told to and you will be alright," the voice said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Got it!" As they ended their conversation, the woman bowed to show her respect.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the tentacle waved again, throwing the lit candle towards the woman and then slowly withdrew to the depths of the mud.</p>

  <p>The woman hurriedly rushed to catch the candle with her hands. As she caught it, she began to stare at the flickering light of the candle as if it were a priceless treasure.</p>

  <p>After all, the woman's actions were not that odd for light was considered to be a luxury in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the circle disappeared, meaning that the barrier was now gone.</p>

  <p>As a result, the soul creatures were drawn to the light again.</p>

  <p>However, the woman was known to be ruthless, unlike the good-tempered Master Snape. In fact, she was known to have killed several disgusting creatures who wanted to share the light.</p>

  <p>With the light at the palm of her hand, greed took over her. Waving her hand, gusts of wild wind surrounded her. At full speed, the heartless wind started to cut the poor soul creatures one by one into pieces.</p>
