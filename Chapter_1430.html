<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The long spear before Zheng emitted a sharp cold glow. Nonetheless, his face remained void of any emotions.</p>

  <p>Facing the questions asked by the Demon Night women, he reached for the tip of the spear and gently pinched it. He then smiled and said, "I'm not looking for anyone."</p>

  <p>The Demon Night women didn't attack. In a normal situation, all they would do was drive away those warriors from other races that were barging in. They were sent here by the sacred place to trade with other races after all. It wouldn't be good for their sacred place if they just randomly killed creatures from other races.</p>

  <p>"If you are not looking for anyone, then leave!" she warned while looking at Zheng. She felt rather strange that he didn't look nervous at all.</p>

  <p>They had thought that Zheng would obediently leave after hearing their warning. However, they had never expected the man to push the spear away from him instead and utter, "I'm not looking for anyone but I'm not leaving either."</p>

  <p>"Then you are looking for death!"</p>

  <p>This was the center of the Demon Night's residential area. These women were the guards here. Thus, they couldn't allow Zheng to just cause any trouble.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night woman thrust forward as soon as her voice faded.</p>

  <p>She was at the Soul Sea Realm and was holding the spear with both hands.</p>

  <p>Her attack was actually very powerful!</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, her spear only managed to move forward three inches and couldn't go any further than that.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled as he pinched the tip of the spear.</p>

  <p>Disbelief flooded the Demon Night woman's eyes. She never thought that this human warrior before her could seal off her spear with just two fingers.</p>

  <p>Unwilling to give up, she used all her might to pull her weapon away.</p>

  <p>However, her spear remained motionless.</p>

  <p>This situation was only possible if the strength between her and the human was almost equal.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Two Demon Night women who were standing by also joined the battle when they saw their friend at a disadvantage. They pounced over from above Zheng's head. But then he abruptly released the spear, took a step forward, and charged towards the tree.</p>

  <p>"Stop him!" one of the Demon Night women shouted.</p>

  <p>Facing the fierce attack from behind, Zheng simply waved his hand and sent the two weapons flying away.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's expression was indifferent, his gaze was grave. This was because Xun had reminded him more than once that this was the first and most important step in helping her take revenge.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A loud sound echoed out. The door at the bottom of the big tree was directly smashed into pieces by Zheng's body. Wood chips fell to the ground, and the sound alarmed all the warriors of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>"Someone is trespassing!"</p>

  <p>"Intercept this person!"</p>

  <p>"Just kill him!"</p>

  <p>This tree was called the Ginkgo Pavilion by the Demon Night members.</p>

  <p>It was a branch of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place set up in Auspice City.</p>

  <p>Zheng's charge was similar to poking a hornet's nest.</p>

  <p>However, many members of the Demon Night were also puzzled. 'Does this human have nothing better to do than to barge into the Ginkgo Pavilion? What on earth is he even doing here?'</p>

  <p>They couldn't figure out any justifiable answer for Zheng's acts. Warriors at the Soul Sea Realm and Spirit Supreme Realm all surrounded him as they all thought of taking the human down.</p>

  <p>Three emerald green arrows shot towards Zheng in an instant. But he just smiled and stepped aside, easily dodging all of them. His body movement skills were superb.</p>

  <p>After he had just dodged the arrows, he came face to face with a broadsword as tall as a man, hacking down towards him.</p>

  <p>It was clear to Zheng that fighting with so many Demon Night warriors would only stop him from reaching his destination. Thus, with a flip of his body, he dodged the large blade before him. His speed was extreme.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he reached the second floor.</p>

  <p>Almost all warriors of the Demon Night were good at speed and were extremely agile.</p>

  <p>However, they all appeared like helpless puppies compared to Zheng. He was continually shifting left and right, rolling up and down, and unexpectedly dodging attacks from six or seven Demon Night women at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Third floor...</p>

  <p>Fourth floor...</p>

  <p>In almost a single breath, Zheng had already charged to the top floor of the Ginkgo Pavilion.</p>

  <p>That was when a soft sigh aired through the place.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>A faint pink figure suddenly appeared behind Zheng. Both of her legs were placed together in the air, and her eyes were filled with coldness. This woman's strength obviously surpassed the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors by far.</p>

  <p>Although he felt the pressure from the woman, Zheng continued to rush forward to the three queens' statues.</p>

  <p>When she saw that Zheng did not listen to her, the woman laughed coldly and pointed two of her fingers towards him, sending out a flying shuttle from her sleeve.</p>

  <p>The tail of the flying shuttle was tied with a dark cyan chain. It shot out for less than a foot before disappearing. Immediately, it passed through space, and in the blink of an eye, it was already hanging on Zheng's legs.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng was bound, he immediately felt an enormous, formless force firmly binding him in place.</p>

  <p>Even so, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in Zheng's hand instantly thrust forward. From within it, six or seven Nether God Shadows shot out and headed straight for the queens' statues.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>The pink-clothed woman's face immediately showed anger. She didn't plan to kill Zheng. She just wanted to punish the one who trespassed into the Ginkgo Pavilion.</p>

  <p>However, a sudden trace of doubt sprang in her heart. What was Zheng's reason for breaking into the Ginkgo Pavilion in the first place? The Ginkgo Pavilion was merely the core of the gathering place of the Demon Night members. It didn't have any great treasures or secrets in it at all. It couldn't be that he was just crazy.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it didn't take a minute more before she understood what this human brat was after. He was actually trying to destroy their queens' statues.</p>

  <p>Wherever there were Demon Night members, there were also queens' statues. They would still build the queens' statues even in none sacred places.</p>

  <p>With the Demon Night members that were stationed in Auspice City, this place was equivalent to a sixth-grade sect. They had built these three queens' statues on the very first day they had entered Auspice City.</p>

  <p>The statues were their totem of faith. They weren't precious, but they were important to the Demon Night warriors. Why was this brat trying to destroy them?</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The pink-clothed woman gently raised her wrist, and another flying shuttle suddenly flew across space. Following this, it charged towards the Nether God Shadows.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>The Nether God Shadows easily shattered by the flying shuttle one after another. However, Zheng's movements just now were too fast. Moreover, he released seven Nether God Shadows at the same time. The flying shuttle continued to move forward but still failed to destroy two Nether God Shadows.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>Two queens' statues were instantly smashed to smithereens.</p>

  <p>The statues of Queen of Life and Queen of Punishment were destroyed.</p>

  <p>The pink-clothed woman's expression went even darker and madder. Her originally indifferent eyes were now filled with a want to kill. Any Demon Night member would defend their queens, and breaking their queens' statues was the greatest blasphemy to their queens.</p>

  <p>"Kill him! Kill him!"</p>

  <p>"How dare he destroy the queens' statues!"</p>

  <p>"Death penalty!"</p>

  <p>The warriors at the bottom of the tree also followed behind. Their eyes were flooding with rage as they saw fragments of the statues flew all over the place.</p>

  <p>The pink-dressed woman did not hesitate any longer and released two formidable flying shuttles to attack Zheng. Two blue-colored lightning balls engulfed the shuttles' surface.</p>

  <p>The balls of lightning were only the size of a fist, but the power contained within them made Zheng's heart jump with fear.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that the Thunder Law has already reached the fifth layer.</p>

  <p>Xun, if you don't come out and help me now, I'll be in trouble!" Zheng calmly said.</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice fell, a blood-red shadow shot out from Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The moment that figure condensed into existence, the Cold Plum Blood Spear in his space ring shot out too and was caught by that figure.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>With two crisp sounds, the two flying shuttles with terrifying balls of lightning were easily brushed aside by the figure.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, the pink-clothed woman, who was in the lead, furrowed her eyebrows and became even more furious than before.</p>

  <p>However, her expression drastically changed when she recognized the figure that had appeared next to Zheng.</p>
