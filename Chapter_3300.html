  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng looked up and said, "We'd better leave as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>The black monkeys had broken the bridge and were sure to come crashing down into the ravine.</p>

  <p>"Okay. Whatever you say," Feng Ge agreed with a nod.</p>

  <p>She felt Zheng tug violently on her hand as he moved forward.</p>

  <p>As she followed Zheng, a strange thought crossed her mind. She realized that she had changed drastically.</p>

  <p>She held a high status in the Source World, causing her peers to feel inferior to her. Even Efrain and Chaim felt she outshone them.</p>

  <p>But this time, she had endured a number of setbacks before and after entering the Grand Sky Temple. This had greatly weakened her confidence.</p>

  <p>Staying in the wooden hut had been bad for her nerves and she had gradually begun to follow Zheng as meek as a lamb.</p>

  <p>"Okay. Whatever you say."</p>

  <p>She had never said words like this before.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea what Feng Ge was thinking about as all he wanted was to get rid of the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>As he ran wildly along the ravine, gigantic pincers emerged from the mud on the river and stretched towards him.</p>

  <p>'How dare these crabs attack me?'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought, frowning.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't taking the crabs seriously even though these were also creatures from the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>He quickly grabbed one of the pincers, pulled out the body that had been hidden in the mud, and smashed it repeatedly to the ground.</p>

  <p>It was a washbasin-sized crab with a strange white pattern on its shell.</p>

  <p>The crab struggled against Zheng's grip but before it could raise its pincers, Zheng stepped on its shell and it shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Some sudden sounds from the ravine behind him startled him. He turned just in time to see the black monkeys jumping off the cliff, some falling to the ground and some into the river.</p>

  <p>The black moneys obviously had strong bodies, brimming with energy as they jumped off the cliff.</p>

  <p>They lived in the Dark Region all year round and had an unusually sharp vision and a keen sense of smell.</p>

  <p>That was why they found him soon.</p>

  <p>Zheng wordlessly continued to run along the ravine.</p>

  <p>He didn't know where the ravine led to.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A group of black monkeys chased after Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>These black monkeys were well-known in the Dark Region. They either lurked in the river or on the cliff. The creatures in the shrubs didn't dare to show up and as they watched Zheng running away, they shook their heads and sighed pityingly. They didn't know how Zheng had provoked the monkeys.</p>

  <p>Crunch!</p>

  <p>The black monkey at the front of the group suddenly jumped up and grabbed a branch of a tree on the edge of the cliff. Swinging off of it, it took off and then pounced on Zheng like a bat out of hell.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt the movement above him and looked up, stunned. He took Feng Ge up in his arms and shouted, "Don't be afraid!" He then gathered his strength and threw Feng Ge forward.</p>

  <p>In the same moment, power erupted from his fists.</p>

  <p>Many divine megatons of force filled his body.</p>

  <p>He was weaker than the three-eyed boy, but if he had to face a black monkey alone...</p>

  <p>Squeak!</p>

  <p>The monkey smiled scornfully at Zheng's action.</p>

  <p>Fearful that Zheng would run away, it had summoned all its strength and applied it to fly forward towards Zheng. It had wanted to cut off his path of escape. But it hadn't expected Zheng to turn around and confront it instead!</p>

  <p>Did Zheng have a death wish?</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng collided in midair with the black monkey.</p>

  <p>One black monkey might not be as strong as the three-eyed boy, but it wasn't to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The impact was such that Zheng felt his bones rattle within his body, as if they had been displaced.</p>

  <p>Zheng had rarely encountered such a strong opponent even in the Source World. But it looked like this kind of opponent was common in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Under the impact, the body of the black monkey bounced onto the cliff. Zheng ran forward and caught Feng Ge, who seemed to be falling in slow motion.</p>

  <p>Once he had gathered her in his arms, he quickly made an escape.</p>

  <p>Quack! Quack!</p>

  <p>The black monkey pushed itself up off the tree, gritting its teeth. It took a couple of breaths before launching off the cliff and chasing after Zheng again.</p>

  <p>The black monkeys chased Zheng across dozens of miles along the ravine. It looked like they weren't about to let Zheng go.</p>

  <p>Zheng was beginning to worry as he fled.</p>

  <p>On one hand, he was afraid of choosing the wrong direction.</p>

  <p>The black monkeys were social creatures. If he were to break into their nests along the ravine, even by mistake, he would be digging his own grave.</p>

  <p>But his luck had always been good and he didn't need to worry about it for the time being.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, he was worried about his physical strength.</p>

  <p>As he fled, he was not only consuming the strength of his physical body, but also the Other Shore Power of the Strength God Totem.</p>

  <p>If the power of the Other Shore Token were to be completely consumed, it would be replenished, but at an annoyingly slow pace.</p>

  <p>Zheng needed the divine crystals to replenish the Other Shore Power at a faster rate.</p>

  <p>It would be easy for him to replenish the divine crystals if he could leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't do that after entering the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>He had always used the Other Shore Power over the past few days. And since he was now running at full speed, the Other Shore Power was being consumed at a faster rate. Once the Other Shore Power of the Strength God Totem was exhausted, he would no longer be able to fight the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>After more than ten miles, the ravine, which was originally over a thousand feet wide, began to narrow with each mile they crossed.</p>

  <p>When the ravine was no longer than ten feet wide, Zheng and Feng Ge looked at each other, worried. It felt like the mountain was moving in on them.</p>

  <p>And then, something weird happened.</p>

  <p>The black monkeys that had been chasing after Zheng and Feng Ge stopped abruptly. They didn't dare to enter the narrow ravine. They stood at the border, chattering and shouting.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, they aren't coming in," said Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"That's good, isn't it?" Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"What are they afraid of? I'm scared something bad is about to happen,"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge said worriedly.</p>

  <p>"I know," Zheng said, shrugging and gently lowering Feng Ge to the ground.</p>

  <p>"You knew that and still came running here? You are going to..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was reproaching Zheng, but suddenly his body began to convulse before he collapsed to the ground.</p>
