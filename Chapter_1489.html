<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1489 Yao Arrived </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The area spanning a tenth-grade sacred place was already unimaginably large, and within a supreme world, there were only two or three world-lord level warriors.</p>

  <p>Ordinary warriors had very little chances of meeting a world lord even once in their lifetimes.</p>

  <p>As for Supreme Lords, although they were scattered throughout the one hundred thousand supreme worlds, they were all legendary figures in the universe.</p>

  <p>From the moment a warrior stepped onto the path of cultivation, they broke through their limits step by step and became even more powerful.</p>

  <p>Once a warrior's cultivation reached a new realm, he or she would name the realm.</p>

  <p>The five levels of body refining, nature level, Illuminating Soul Realm, Internal Elixir Realm, Virtual Tribulation Realm, Life and Death Realm... After that, there were the Soul Sea Realm, Spirit Supreme Realm, and Spirit Transformation Realm. Eventually, a warrior became a world lord.</p>

  <p>In theory, a world lord was the last realm warriors could reach. It was the end of the cultivation path warriors could reach with their talent and perseverance.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to walk farther with only those two aspects. If a warrior wanted to continue on that path, he or she would need a Crown of Destiny. Only by carrying the Heavenly Destiny would they be qualified to become Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>There were only 128 Supreme Lords in the entire universe. Four had already appeared before Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also a bit speechless at the moment.</p>

  <p>He knew that these Supreme Lords had come for his Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the crown was far more important than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that the number of Supreme Lords who appeared before him was still increasing.</p>

  <p>Five...</p>

  <p>Six...</p>

  <p>Seven...</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At this moment, the sword spirit inside Luo Zheng's body manifested next to him. Xun stood beside him and stared indifferently at the sky.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Gunter." She frowned.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Gunter?" Luo Zheng's gaze was fixed on the seventh Supreme Lord. From his appearance, he was able to determine that the Supreme Lord was a Demon Night member. However, he had not heard of him before.</p>

  <p>"Since Supreme Lord Gunter has come, Yao would be here too,"</p>

  <p>Xun said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Yao!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng heard this name, killing intent flashed through his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had never wanted to kill someone as much as he wanted to kill Yao. Not even Eddie, who had been his great adversary. If Eddie had been willing to let Yan go, Luo Luo Zheng would have let him go as well, even though he badly wanted to do away with him.</p>

  <p>However, this woman was an exception.</p>

  <p>Xun still looked at the sky as a deep blue light appeared there. At the front of the light was a person wearing the Saint Sky Armor and slowly approaching them, the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hands.</p>

  <p>The woman was one of the three queens of the Demon Night race, the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had seen Yao's statues more than once before. He had even broken her statues several times, but this was the first time he had come face to face with her true appearance.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "Fine feathers make fine birds." The Saint Sky Armor was special as it was made according to Yao's figure. It made her chest look plumper and her waist look more slender. Beneath the bottom of the armor, her legs were slim and athletic. She was like a demure and composed goddess.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had to admit that Yao was indeed an almost perfect woman, but on her beautiful face, there was an almost violent and malicious sneer.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the queens of the Demon Night would only be at the world-lord level. After all, none of the three queens carried the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>But at the moment, a bright blue ray of light shone behind Yao. This ray of light was the Pool of Faith of the Demon Night which belonged to her. The Pool of Faith continuously replenished her Faith Energy. It was her fighting state. It was due to the help of the pool that Yao was not inferior to any Supreme Lord present here.</p>

  <p>However, the strongest one of the three queens of the Demon Night was, in fact, Xun. After all, she was the Queen of Killings as well as the strongest weapon that the Demon Night possessed.</p>

  <p>Next came Yao, and then the Queen of Life.</p>

  <p>Xun was unable to use her Pool of Faith because Yao had sealed it up. However, previously when Xun was able to extract the Faith Energy from it, she had still not been a match to a world lord. After all, she was in a rather poor condition right now and was unable to absorb the Faith Energy without restraint.</p>

  <p>As the Supreme Lords in the sky spotted Yao, they took several steps back, their faces revealing traces of fear.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night only had four Supreme Lords, which was fewer than those of the humans and ogres. But the three queens were not weaker than the Supreme Lords and matched up to them in their own right. It was about the same as having three more Supreme Lords. Even though the Queen of Killings was nowhere to be found right now, the Queen of Punishment was not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lords were divided into top-rank, mid-rank, and low-rank individuals. They each had their own Heavenly Destiny. The Laws of Causality that they possessed were different, and thus their levels of strength were also different.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords who had just now appeared could be considered to be low-rank. As for Yao, she was comparable to a mid-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Yao sashayed and slowly tip-toed in the sky with a proud expression on her face. It was as if she did not take these Supreme Lords seriously at all. She straightaway headed toward the mini Immortal Mansion above the desert.</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords were currently in a stalemate, and it would not be entirely surprising if they started a fight for the sake of the Crown of Destiny. But since they were all Supreme Lords, they were constantly weighing the pros and cons of their decisions. As of now, they maintained a delicate balance. No one wanted to snatch away the tiny Immortal Mansion, for they were afraid that they would become the target of heavy public criticism.</p>

  <p>But when Yao stepped forward, it was as if nobody else was present.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Addison could not help but speak out to stop her.</p>

  <p>But just as Supreme Lord Addison opened his mouth, Supreme Lord Gunter's ghost-like figure floated over to Yao's side. He had an arrogant smile on his face as he stared at Supreme Lord Addison.</p>

  <p>"Addison, this is an internal matter of our Demon Night race. Do you want to interfere?"</p>

  <p>"An internal matter? What a joke! When did the Crown of Destiny become the internal matter of the Demon Night?" Supreme Lord Addison asked with anger. The ogres also had mid-rank and top-rank Supreme Lords. It was just that they had not made an appearance as of yet. Otherwise, he would have already taken action.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night and the ogres never got along well. The two races had fought against each other in dozens of supreme worlds up until now.</p>

  <p>However, in race wars of this level, Supreme Lords rarely fought. Even if a supreme world was occupied by the other force, it would be difficult to attract the attention of a Supreme Lord. After all, the Supreme Lords of every race were their trump cards. Once they participated in a normal-level war, the shockwaves they created would no longer make the situation a trivial matter.</p>

  <p>"The Queen of Killings of the Demon Night is hiding in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Tell me, is this not an internal matter of the Demon Night?" Supreme Lord Gunter asked with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>"The Queen of Killings? Xun?" Supreme Lord Addison frowned at once.</p>

  <p>Back then, Xun had killed a Supreme Lord in order to help Leroy get a Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Every Supreme Lord's death was an event that shook the heavens in this universe. Killing a Supreme Lord had far-reaching consequences and was tough to boot. Even a top-rank Supreme Lord did not have complete confidence that he or she could kill a low-rank one.</p>

  <p>However, Xun had managed to do it. She was also the first world lord to kill a Supreme Lord, even though she had relied on the Faith Energy of the Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>They could not forget how it had happened. Since then, Xun's name was remembered by each and every Supreme Lord. It was the Queen of Killings who had killed a Supreme Lord, with no Heavenly Destiny on her shoulders.</p>

  <p>Several hundred years ago, Xun had suddenly vanished in the universe.</p>

  <p>Even though the Demon Night members had tried their best to conceal this matter, the statues of the queens were spread throughout the various sacred places of the race. It was almost impossible to hide something so huge.</p>

  <p>To the Supreme Lords of other races, it was good news. Later on, they got to know that the two queens of Demon Night were engaged in an internal conflict.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that this matter was true.</p>

  <p>The most powerful queen of the Demon Night was hiding in this tiny Immortal Mansion! Since she possessed the Crown of Destiny, why did she not try to carry the Heavenly Destiny? The Supreme Lords present were clearly suspicious.</p>

  <p>Yao did not pay any attention to the conjectures of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>As she stopped a certain distance from the mini Immortal Mansion, a small smile bloomed across her mouth. "Xun, it's time to come out, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>Xun's gaze was fixed on Yao's face. She, who was usually so calm and indifferent, couldn't keep her cool anymore. Just as she was about to speak, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly reached out and stopped her with a smile. "Let me handle this bitch."</p>
