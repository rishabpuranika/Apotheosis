<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1087 Space Chopping Sword (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was in a warrior's nature to fight. Warriors fought with the other warriors, with their fate and even with the heavens.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's mind, there was no fear, only excitement when it came to a challenge.</p>

  <p>It was only through fighting others that a warrior could truly know his strength. It was competition that allowed one to further advance in the realm of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng itched to challenge all these divine kingdom talents in front of him.</p>

  <p>His body screamed to release his strength and engage all of it in a fight to find out just how strong these warriors were compared to him.</p>

  <p>However, there was a task at hand. Ning Yudie waited for him back home and he had to collect all the life stones he could carry without ruffling too many feathers. Attracting the attention of the York Divine Kingdom's Holy Maiden and Soul Sea Realm masters would only bring him a whole lot of unnecessary trouble.</p>

  <p>So it was rather necessary for him to keep a low profile.</p>

  <p>But it seemed Lord Randy was about to change all that. Wherever Luo Zheng went, there would always be someone who raised him up for all to see, and he wouldn't be able to do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Lord Randy was certainly going to ask him to fight in his place.</p>

  <p>Both Lord Randy and the crown prince were in a head to head battle of proving themselves to Turner Zhou, their father and the emperor of their kingdom. Their strength was very much well known but it was their influence that was vital in gauging their true social power.</p>

  <p>The crown prince had powerful talents like Edwin and Gregory but Lord Randy only had Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was a reason why he treated Luo Zheng so well. Despite his status, Lord Randy regarded the warrior as an equal and was openly honest towards him. This was because he wanted to gain his trust which could only be done through sincerity. Luo Zheng was a difficult person to persuade after all.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he truly believed in that young man's potential. He knew that a close relationship with Luo Zheng would bring forth good fortune for him.</p>

  <p>So instead of worrying whether or not Luo Zheng was willing to fight for him, Lord Randy was already thinking about when it would be best to send him out. He was determined to have Luo Zheng represent him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Gregory and Logan were quickly thrown into a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>As the top Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior of the Jade Martial House, Gregory truly did not disappoint the warriors of Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>His attacks were even stronger than Titus's.</p>

  <p>His mid-grade sacred weapon also proved to be effective in making a dent against Logan's space armor. Although it could never hope to shatter it, the blade left enough marks on the otherwise impenetrable armor for the crowd to get excited.</p>

  <p>If Gregory hit him enough times, Logan's armor was sure to crumble.</p>

  <p>"My saber is called Dragon Tooth made from the teeth of a Genuine Dragon. Resistance is futile and that armor won't be able to protect you for long. A warrior, who only knows how to retreat, will eventually lose!" Gregory sneered. He moved like the wind as he charged towards Logan.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>He left another deep slash across the space armor, pushing Logan back a few feet.</p>

  <p>Everyone's breath hitched. Gregory's blade intent had contained the power to break through anything and that included space itself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in approval. Gregory was indeed formidable and if Logan continued to only resist, his space armor would eventually be broken and he would be left defenseless.</p>

  <p>Or would he? Luo Zheng sighed to himself once he realized something.</p>

  <p>Logan had only used his space armor to block Gregory's attack since the beginning but he hadn't brought out all his cards to the game yet. He had yet to show his true strengths. Gregory shouldn't rejoice. There was still a margin of possibility that he might not beat his opponent.</p>

  <p>In all honesty, Luo Zheng would prefer it if Gregory won. If that happened, Lord Randy would not be able to challenge Gregory since they both came from the same divine kingdom. Thus Luo Zheng wouldn't be asked to come out.</p>

  <p>However, he knew that he was only delaying the inevitable. Luo Zheng would have to fight at some point but he hoped it wouldn't be so soon.</p>

  <p>The fight between the two warriors was heating up.</p>

  <p>Gregory's fierce saber skills had proven effective in breaking down Logan's defenses. If he continued with this strategy, Logan would really end up losing.</p>

  <p>However, Logan wasn't stupid. He knew his opponent had the capacity to attack his defense so he took the initiative to remove his space armor. It was time that he moved into the offense.</p>

  <p>He looked at Gregory with contempt before waving his hand and gathering light around his arm.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>There was a vibration and then a slight buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the light converged into a hazy, long sword that appeared in Logan's hand.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a physical sword, but rather, it was the space that was shaped into a long sword— if that made any sense.</p>

  <p>Essentially, Logan had used space to forge himself a weapon. It seemed that his proficiency in Space Law allowed him to use it both for defense and offense.</p>

  <p>"That's Logan's Space Chopping Sword! Oh man, this is going to be exciting!"</p>

  <p>"That's Logan's ultimate skill. For Gregory to force him to use it means he really has driven Logan up to a wall."</p>

  <p>"It's truly an impressive feat for Gregory but he should watch out. That Space Chopping Sword is definitely built to cut off an opponent's limbs."</p>

  <p>The warriors' discussions reached Gregory's ears. It seemed that this Space Chopping Sword wasn't something to be taken lightly. Gregory's eyes were filled with determination. Who said he was taking this lightly?</p>

  <p>He was someone who came from nothing and worked hard his entire life to rise and become the top warrior among the younger generation in the Jade Martial House.</p>
