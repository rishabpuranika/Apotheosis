  <p>In fact, Lucille was a fan of Zheng's.</p>

  <p>She used to be addicted to narratives. Because Zheng was a good storyteller out in the universe, she was attracted to his yarns. Listening to his stories in her rest time had become one of her hobbies. She would while away hours listening to his stories.</p>

  <p>She had listened to all the stories Zheng had told during these past few years. Whenever Zheng's voice rang out, she would even stop cultivating to listen to him telling stories for several hours.</p>

  <p>These stories were all told to a mysterious girl, and, like the rest of the universe, she knew she was just a random listener.</p>

  <p>She would never have expected that the man in front of her was Zheng.</p>

  <p>Besides her, the other warriors were also surprised, and they couldn't help but curiously look Zheng up and down. They wanted to see what the mighty Zheng, who had killed several Supreme Lords looked like, and if there was anything special about him.</p>

  <p>Most of these warriors were curious about Zheng, but some of them secretly harbored a killing intention behind their studying looks.</p>

  <p>The ace talents and Godly Geniuses present were all at the top of their game, and were thought highly of by their own clans.</p>

  <p>They were either the direct descendants of the Supreme Lords, or those guided by the Supreme Lords. After their talents were discovered, they had been valued by their clans. The four Supreme Lords Zheng had killed before were all related to these warriors, so they naturally regarded Zheng as their enemy now, since he had killed their clan members.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not seem at all bothered by their hostility, and he talked happily with Tianming in a low voice.</p>

  <p>All of them had been waiting here for about an hour already.</p>

  <p>During this time, Zheng was listening to Tianming relating what he had experienced in the past six years in the Lower World and the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Margaret's experience during these few years could not be spoken of in the same terms as Tianming's experience. She had only cultivated in the Purple Power World all this time. She had never left the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming was different.</p>

  <p>From crossing the Chaotic Ocean of Stars to traveling in the four divine kingdoms, his experiences were thrilling and exciting.</p>

  <p>The most important experience was the time when he was on the savage land. With the aid of something great that Tianming had gained there and his own talent, he had made such a great achievement.</p>

  <p>As for what the great thing was, Tianming did not tell Zheng the details. Zheng naturally would not question him too closely, for that would have been rude.</p>

  <p>Everyone had their own secrets, and Zheng understood that Tianming must have a reason why he did not want to explain.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng had searched for that information in the memory of the great world's will. The great world's memory recorded everything that happened every second of every day, and he could search for information by using a thought.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng was trying to search for the information, he found that the great world's memory of this part was blurry. It seemed that someone had erased the great world's will! All the memories about the savage land were blurry, and he could not find anything useful.</p>

  <p>This was so strange.</p>

  <p>Zheng wondered why the great world he was in suddenly had so many secrets.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon was born on the Divine Kingdom Continent, and there were many world lords' dead bodies gathered below the Sea God Continent. Moreover, the savage land, where he had not been, had such secrets. These things could not be said to be mere coincidences.</p>

  <p>The two of them were having a good talk. Margaret thought their conversation was boring. However, since she had not seen Zheng for a long time, she was already satisfied just by being able to hear Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the cold voice of the mysterious girl rang out again as she ordered, "Warriors, you may now enter the purple light pillar in front of you."</p>

  <p>After her voice faded away, the ace talents, who had already waited for a long time, began to enter the purple light pillar.</p>

  <p>After they each walked into the light pillar, there was a gentle buoyancy which slowly lifted them upwards.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Zheng said to Margaret as he walked up to the light pillar.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng stepped into this purple light pillar, he sensed a strong momentum lifting him up. This momentum was so complex that it seemed to have originated from the mixture of all the profound meanings.</p>

  <p>"This is… It's the will of the heavens!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face grew serious as he realized the truth about the momentum.</p>

  <p>This momentum was not a new thing to Zheng, and many of the warriors present had even experienced it before.</p>

  <p>When warriors underwent their tribulations, the momentum emitted by the terrifying Heavenly Tribulation represented the will of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Fishes were swimming slowly within the purple light. When the fishes drew close to Zheng, they could easily pass through Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The moment these fishes began passing through Zheng's body, they left a trace of their comprehension behind inside his body.</p>

  <p>"This is the rule of the heavens!"</p>

  <p>"Every fish contains a rule of the heavens."</p>

  <p>"The marks they each leave can benefit us a lot."</p>

  <p>During a warrior's cultivation, after the initial opening of the Soul Sea, he had to start to build his inner world.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, there were no rules in their inner worlds but only their seas of life vitality, which contained no life in the beginning.</p>

  <p>After these fishes passed through a warrior's body, they left behind the rudiments of these rules.</p>

  <p>These were very useful for the establishment of rules in their inner worlds. This kind of benefit could not be found anywhere else in the universe.</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, only three hundred warriors were gifted with the baptism of the purple light.</p>

  <p>No wonder that so many races and clans all attached importance to this Illusion Battlefield. Even the Supreme Lords of every race could not give them this kind of experience, after all these Supreme Lords were only able to instill comprehension of the rule of one Heavenly Destiny in their people. But they could sense every rule of the entire universe here.</p>

  <p>Everyone closed their eyes as they focused on comprehending the marks which these fishes had left inside their bodies while slowly flying upwards in the purple light.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also comprehending the marks as he slowly rose upwards.</p>

  <p>Once a sea of life vitality turned into an inner world, it was fully controlled by its owner. Nothing could be accomplished without obeying standards and rules, so only by gradually establishing these rules could one make his entire inner world function normally.</p>

  <p>They were not able to control the rules of the heavens in these fishes, after all, each rule was a Heavenly Destiny. Only a Supreme Lord could control one Heavenly Destiny and make full use of it.</p>

  <p>But the warriors could use these rules as reference points to build the rules of their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>In fact, all warriors, who entered the purple light had this comprehension.</p>

  <p>Except for one warrior who had not comprehended at all, Margaret!</p>

  <p>Right now she was still looking at the fishes with a confused expression as she held tightly to Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The other warriors, including Zheng, were all shocked by the enormity of the will of the heavens.</p>

  <p>However, Margaret felt very different from the others. She felt quite indifferent since she had not been enlightened by this law at all.</p>

  <p>She had a familiar feeling in the momentum emitted by the purple light.</p>

  <p>It was exactly the same as the momentum which was released when she had cultivated a special mind method.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that this momentum was much older and more mature than the one in the mind method.</p>

  <p>The mind method had been passed down to her by her master.</p>

  <p>According to what her master had said: that mind method was created according to the rules in the Purple Power World, and only warriors with first rank Purple Power Body could cultivate this method.</p>

  <p>She did not overthink it, so she could not figure out the connection between these two types of momentum. But she was not interested in figuring it out.</p>

  <p>As they rose up to a certain height, the mysterious girl's commanding voice was heard by everyone of the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Of the Evolutionary Fifty, only forty-nine are useful. Of the Evolutionary Fifty, separate one into two. One is variable, and the other one is definite!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile…</p>

  <p>The three hundred warriors continued to slowly rise up vertically.</p>

  <p>But right now, everyone's rising path began to change.</p>

  <p>Many warriors were flying to the left side of the light pillar. "The left side is definite, you can't change your fate!"</p>

  <p>A few others flew to the right side of the light pillar. "The right side is variable, your futures are limitless."</p>

  <p>About two hundred warriors had been moved to the left side of the light pillar. They were surprised and disillusioned when the mysterious girl announced that their fates were unchangeable.</p>

  <p>However, there were ninety nine warriors at the right side, and their fates were changeable. Their destinies were, according to the mysterious girl, limitless.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What's going on? Why is there one warrior missing?" the mysterious girl wondered aloud.</p>

  <p>Since the mysterious girl had hosted the Illusion Battlefield from the beginning, her voice had always been cold, without any emotion. After all, she was the arbiter of the Illusion Battlefield. Except for the time that she laughed and joked with Zheng, the others all felt she was indifferent and almost apathetic.</p>

  <p>Noticing the strange scene, her originally solemn voice suddenly changed. These assembled ace talents all felt her tone was now strange, and they opened their eyes one by one, confused.</p>

  <p>They were even more confused after they had opened their eyes.</p>

  <p>Moments earlier, the mysterious girl had separated the warriors to two sides by defining their fates.</p>

  <p>There existed only two kinds of fates. One was variable, and the other one was definite. However, there was one warrior still floating in the center of the purple light pillar.</p>

  <p>The warrior floating alone in the center of the light pillar was none other than Zheng!</p>
