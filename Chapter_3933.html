<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God had tried to communicate with the Source World all this time.</p>

  <p>He could faintly sense the will of the Source World, but was unable to grasp it.</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship did not participate in the battle with the Pear Hill. The Evil God had studied his own abilities all the time.</p>

  <p>The opportunity had appeared after he had left the Source World. The will of the Source World, which had once tried to dodge the Evil God, seemed to want him to stay in the Source World.</p>

  <p>If the Source World were considered a living being or a person, it wouldn't want its own evil will to leave. This was because Usman had originally been a part of the Source World and the Evil God had devoured him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had also been a part of Zheng before and Zheng had had to think twice before letting the Evil God leave.</p>

  <p>When the Grandmaster of Heaven had fought the people of the Pear Hill outside the Source World, the Evil God seized this opportunity and quickly connected with the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Evil God felt that the Source World was a vast and powerful will. He saw it as a living being, born with the birth of one round of chaos.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God's consciousness had merged with this vast will, he was like a tiger that had broken into a flock of sheep.</p>

  <p>There were millions and millions of sheep, but they were no match for the tiger.</p>

  <p>It was easy for the Evil God to pollute the will of the entire Source World and become its ruler.</p>

  <p>"How did you make it?" the captain of the Black Ship asked.</p>

  <p>Usman had lived for a longer time and had been stronger than the Evil God at the time. However, he hadn't been able to fuse with the will of the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship had allowed the Evil God to merge with Usman, because they wanted him to replace Usman and control the Source World.</p>

  <p>This thought was, however, impractical. Some of the key steps were like mysteries that could not be solved. They needed the Nihility race to join hands with the Black Ship in order to slowly explore them.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that it was impossible to achieve overnight. But the Evil God had completed the task pretty easily, after having devoured Usman a few days ago.</p>

  <p>"This is not the tone you should be talking to me in," the Evil God said rather arrogantly.</p>

  <p>He stood up a little taller, while the captain looked minuscule before him.</p>

  <p>His condescending manner angered all the members of the Black Ship, including Shera.</p>

  <p>"You brat! What kind of a tone do you think we should use?" the brass man shouted, trembling as he struggled to stand up. The deck under his feet creaked. It was not easy to resist the pressure of the Source World's will.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..." The Evil God merely sneered contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The deck under the brass man's feet broke and he was pressed into the ship's cabin.</p>

  <p>Nobody could tolerate the Evil God, seeing as he was bullying others so ruthlessly. Even Shera's eyes glimmered dangerously.</p>

  <p>When all of them took out the Other Shore Tokens, the captain raised one hand, making a gesture to stop them. He then bowed to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Captain!"</p>

  <p>"What are you doing, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"This guy is so ungrateful!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship exploded in indignation as they watched the captain they had admired and respected bow to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The captain said, "The reason why the Nihility race supports our Black Ship is because they want to have a stronger power in the chaos. And it looks like we haven't done a good job."</p>

  <p>The battle between the Finale Way and the Purge Way was a combat among the Chaos Ancient Gods. The Black Ship could only let the Grandmaster of Heaven join the fight. The members of the Black Ship, led by the captain, weren't even qualified to watch.</p>

  <p>"The Black Ship should be led by someone who is immensely powerful.</p>

  <p>From now on, I am no longer the captain of the Black Ship. He is the new captain," the captain said to the members of the Black Ship as he bowed once again to the Evil God. "I will pass this decision to the Grandmaster of Heaven. Are you satisfied?"</p>

  <p>The captain's decision to abdicate pushed the members of the Black Ship into a deeper shock than they could have imagined.</p>

  <p>The captain had never changed ever since the Black Ship was born.</p>

  <p>"Captain, please don't!"</p>

  <p>"Captain, how can you let this man rule the Black Ship?"</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship had never trusted the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Apart from Shera, most of them disliked the Evil God. They were on guard against him because of what had happened to Usman.</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship might not be willing to obey the Evil God if he became the captain.</p>

  <p>The captain turned a deaf ear to the complaints. He merely stared at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Evil God said, shrugging, and then turned around to enter the cabin. Before he went in, he turned around and said, "When the Grandmaster of Heaven is revived, ask him to see me as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Saying thus, the Evil God got into the cabin, leaving a wave of fierce wrath roiling among the members.</p>

  <p>The brass man, who had climbed up from the bottom of the cabin, asked, his eyes red, "Why would you do something like this, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Even if you let him fulfill his wish, he won't be on our side!" another member said.</p>

  <p>"It's my fault, letting him join the Black Ship!" Shera said bitterly, her eyes pained. It looked like she had brought trouble to the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>After all the members had vented their anger, the captain said slowly, "Are you all done?"</p>

  <p>The members stared at the captain. They had nothing to say but to denounce the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Both the Evil God and Usman, as the incarnation of the evil will, are destined not to submit to anyone," the captain said, his gaze fixed on the brass man. "Usman, Evil God, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and I are very clear about this."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you still cultivate him? Why do you let him act so willfully?" the brass man asked, confused.</p>

  <p>The captain smiled and replied, "Remember the mission of our Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Our goal is not to create or survive, but to destroy."</p>

  <p>The Nihility race didn't care whether or not the Evil God was loyal. As an incarnation of the evil will, he was born for destruction.</p>

  <p>This destruction came from his evil nature, which was different from the reasons behind the Nihility Way, but they had the same goal and that was enough.</p>

  <p>The captain then went back to his cabin, leaving the members standing on the deck.</p>

  <p>A crack passed through the Taoism Province. It was hundreds of millions of miles long and looked dangerous. The fatal chaotic energy had already deadened the Taoism Province.</p>

  <p>The boundary wall between the Taoism Province and the Pear Hill was damaged. A crack, hundreds of feet wide, now decorated the boundary wall, chaotic energy spreading slowly through it. All the creatures in a radius of dozens of miles around the crack had retreated to safety.</p>

  <p>This was quickly reported. Before the chaotic energy spread out completely, a mountain leader appeared, carrying a mountain, and placed it into the crack in the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>This was only temporary. The Pear Hill would find a way to repair the wall in the future.</p>

  <p>While the Pear Hill was coping with the aftermath of the disaster, Zheng, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the two Chaos Ancient Gods finally returned safely.</p>

  <p>When these huge masters appeared in the Pear Hill, it caused great excitement and cheer among the people there.</p>

  <p>They had won the final victory in the eyes of the members and disciples of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>But Zheng, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess knew that this war was only the beginning. The real test was still ahead and it was going to be anything but easy.</p>
