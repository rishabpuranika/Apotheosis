  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3751 Imprisoning Lightning </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Phoenix lay on the ground and stared at the gradually brightening Magical Thunder Slave. Her face darkened with despair.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, she had contacted the Element Spirit race, and conferred with Micah and the others in Stage Thirty-two.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race, still regarding the "losers" of the Jin Wu as their allies, had not been on guard against them.</p>

  <p>How could her secret have been exposed as soon as she entered the ice castle?</p>

  <p>At this point, however, the reason hardly mattered.</p>

  <p>The fact was that Phoenix was no match for the Magical Thunder Slave.</p>

  <p>Indeed, after fending off his first two attacks, she was already exhausted.</p>

  <p>She was certain that she couldn't withstand the next one.</p>

  <p>At that moment, unbidden, the thought of Luo Zheng came into Phoenix's mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Li Bianxue were hiding not far away, and she hoped dearly that the Magical Thunder Slave and the Chill Ice Slaves would not be able to find them.</p>

  <p>A crash of thunder was heard in the air.</p>

  <p>The Magical Thunder Slave rushed towards Phoenix, launching his next attack. She waited helplessly for the onslaught.</p>

  <p>But as the lightning approached Phoenix, a figure darted forward from the side.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Phoenix had led them competently and cautiously through the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she had been calm and confident as she entered the ice castle, so Luo Zheng had believed that she would pass through safely.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, not long after she entered the ice castle, she had been chased out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Li Bianxue were crouched together in an ice pit, concealing themselves.</p>

  <p>At the unmistakable sound of thunder and battle, Luo Zheng had warily poked his head out of the ice pit, determined to see what was happening. He'd seen and understood Phoenix's plight, and immediately jumped out of the pit to aid her.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue tried to stop him, but Luo Zheng went anyway.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue sighed. It was already a risk for them to sneak through the Blooming Jade Stage!</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had revealed himself, they wouldn't be able to hide any longer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved with such speed that the air whistled past him.</p>

  <p>He reached out and tried to grasp the lightning as it struck at Phoenix.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, he found that it was the real body of the Magical Thunder Slave, which writhed like a lightning snake most of the time.</p>

  <p>"So, you dare to try and catch me!"</p>

  <p>The Magical Thunder Slave spoke in a sneering voice, but he was also caught by surprise at how Luo Zheng had seemingly rushed out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng had appeared with a physical body, and the Magical Thunder Slave wondered to which race he belonged. Who would dare to help Phoenix in the Blooming Jade Stage?</p>

  <p>The Magical Thunder Slave hesitated for a moment before realizing that he couldn't see Luo Zheng's face clearly. It meant this warrior had entered the Other Shore with his physical body.</p>

  <p>He immediately realized that Luo Zheng might be the human brat long sought by his superiors on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But how had he passed through the other ice castles?</p>

  <p>As far as the Magical Thunder Slave knew, the Magical Thunder Slaves, the Chill Ice Slaves, and the Moon Fire Slaves? all stronger than himself? had already made those ice castles impassable.</p>

  <p>It should have been impossible for Luo Zheng to come through...</p>

  <p>But since he was here, safe and sound, that could only mean that Luo Zheng had somehow broken through all the strong lines of defense that barred his way.</p>

  <p>Then it must be that Luo Zheng's power was far greater than it appeared at first glance.</p>

  <p>As the Magical Thunder Slave considered these implications, he hesitated, yet remained confused and vigilant about Luo Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>But anyway, the Magical Thunder Slave was among the most powerful of the Element Spirit race. He did not believe that Luo Zheng could defeat him directly. And as for how Luo Zheng had arrived here, well, there must be some hidden reason he could not see.</p>

  <p>The Magical Thunder Slave was half right. It was true that Luo Zheng didn't arrive here through normal way. But he was wrong about Luo Zheng's power. Luo Zheng was definitely strong enough to defeat him in a fight.</p>

  <p>There was a sizzling noise, as though from an electric current.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept his grip on the lightning, but it was very thick and wiry in his hand.</p>

  <p>Like a snake, the lightning coiled around his hands and up his arms, twisting around his neck.</p>

  <p>It released the terrifying power of thunder as it moved along Luo Zheng's body, corroding his physical body and rapidly consuming his Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Divine Dao could be used to restore the Chaotic Source Spirits in Luo Zheng's body, but it was not quickly enough to match the speed of the lightning attack.</p>

  <p>"This Magical Thunder Slave is indeed extremely powerful. Primeval Lord of Heaven, please help me!" aloud he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been also well-prepared before coming to this place.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had a deep understanding of the Element Spirit race, so he must know the ways of restraining them.</p>

  <p>However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was not an invincible existence. His physical body was still trapped in Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Currently, he was just an energy soul. But with the help of the power of a Civilization Artifact, he was able to defeat those weak members of the Element Spirit race in and below Stage Twenty-eight.</p>

  <p>But the Blooming Jade Stage? where Luo Zheng, Phoenix, and Li Bianxue now found themselves? was already Stage Thirty.</p>

  <p>In this stage, due to weaker and weaker suppression, the creatures of the Other Shore became stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't have the confidence to win by himself in an encounter with the Magical Thunder Slave, so he needed to rely on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A buzzing sound filled the air.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng voiced his request, sparks of purple light flashed in his hands.</p>

  <p>They traveled from his skin and into the body of the Magical Thunder Slave, which was still entwined around Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The effect of the purple light was quick and remarkable. As the purple light shone on the Magical Thunder Slave, his body became solid and opaque, turning into a muddy, grayish-brown substance.</p>

  <p>"What have you done?" asked the Magical Thunder Slave, sounding shocked.</p>

  <p>He wrapped himself more tightly around Luo Zheng's body and frantically released the power of thunder.</p>

  <p>The Magical Thunder Slave had already been amazed when, upon his attack, Luo Zheng managed to resist for several seconds.</p>

  <p>But after all, he had heard that Luo Zheng's physical body was incomparable, and that he had even become the ruler of Stage Fourteen. So the Magical Thunder Slave was prepared for an extraordinary display of strength. Still, he had never imagined that Luo Zheng would be able to release a token capable of altering his lightning form!</p>

  <p>The Magical Thunder Slave lived in the lightning form. That made him an immensely difficult enemy, for as an entity of pure energy he was capable of powerful attacks and was virtually immortal.</p>

  <p>The purple light was the work of the Primeval Lord of Heaven. It was called the Imprisoning Lightning.</p>

  <p>When it was first conceived, the Imprisoning Lightning was not used as a weapon against the Magical Thunder Slaves.</p>

  <p>A long time ago, the group of human heroes led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven ended up being trapped in the Heavenly Thunder Plain of Stage Thirty-three. At that time, the 77th civilization hadn't been destroyed. All the human masters, including the Primeval Lord of Heaven, didn't dare to return to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was forced into seclusion in the chaos for a long while before he finally created the Imprisoning Lightning and led the human masters back to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Imprisoning Lightning was not intended to destroy thunder. Instead, it acted to infuse another unique energy into the electric force of thunder.</p>

  <p>When the Imprisoning Lightning merged with the thunder, the thunder would be converted into another form.</p>

  <p>After the Primeval Lord of Heaven released the purple light of the Imprisoning Lightning, the lightning that covered the entire plain turned into grayish brown objects that fell onto the ground. The Heavenly Thunder Plain, which had been rumbling for billions of years, became quiet for perhaps the first time in known history.</p>

  <p>Now, the Imprisoning Lightning that had silenced the lightning of the Heavenly Thunder Plain also had an astounding effect on the Magical Thunder Slave.</p>

  <p>The purple light was not released by the Civilization Artifact? it was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's own token.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven in Luo Zheng's body was just an energy soul, so he could only release the Imprisoning Lightning at a very close range. In this case, Luo Zheng had needed to get as close as possible to the Magical Thunder Slave to ensure the effectiveness of the attack.</p>

  <p>The purple light flashed as it was emitted from Luo Zheng's hands, continuing to pass through the lightning body of the Magical Thunder Slave.</p>

  <p>To his horror, the Magical Thunder Slave realized that his range of movement was becoming more and more limited as his body turned into a solid grayish-brown substance. He felt stiff, almost as though he had been paralyzed.</p>
