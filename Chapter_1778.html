  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>Preston's punch hit them with a powerful force and sent the small skulls flying at a fast hurling speed!</p>

  <p>The terrifying strength of a powerful and esteemed warrior at the Spirit Transformation Realm was more than enough to send the small skulls millions of feet away.</p>

  <p>Once they were gone, Preston's shoulders sagged in relief. With a swift movement of his hand, Preston took out two life vitality jades and crushed them before absorbing them quickly. He then took out three emerald green pills and swallowed them all in one gulp. Their effects were immediate, and he could feel the warm rush of his energy quickly returning to him.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going after this?" Preston asked, raising his brows inquisitively.</p>

  <p>As a powerful master at the Spirit Transformation Realm, Preston should have made the decision by himself; however, as he faced the sorcerer race, whose existence was a mystery in itself, he began to feel lost and confused and decided to ask Ning Yudie about her plans.</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie suggested they should return to the Lower World, Preston immediately thought that it was a wise decision. The supreme worlds were in chaos and only the Lower World remained unaffected by the disarray. They could find solace there.</p>

  <p>What they didn't expect, however, was the fact that the sorcerer race would still pursue them relentlessly.</p>

  <p>Preston was puzzled. Their purpose didn't make any sense to him. There was no one in the group important enough to attract them, so why would the sorcerer race want to hunt them down?</p>

  <p>Moreover, the time and place that this horde of sorcerer warriors chose to appear were very strange and suspicious. The sorcerer warriors were already there at the Ascending Well when they arrived, as though they had been guarding there and waiting for them all this time.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie shook her head in confusion. "I didn't expect that these sorcerer warriors would suddenly appear at the Ascending Well. It's impossible that their intention was to try and stop us there."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I also think so," Preston agreed with Yudie's conjecture. "Looking at this from another perspective, if this group of warriors from the sorcerer race have been guarding the Ascending Well, then there must be something important underneath the Ascending Well."</p>

  <p>Beneath the Ascending Well was the ascending passageway, which connected the great world below.</p>

  <p>In other words, the sorcerer race must be guarding something from this great world. That would explain their strange actions.</p>

  <p>"I remember now. I think there are sorcerer race members in the great world," Ning Yudie added, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Preston's eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded firmly. "My husband mentioned that he had encountered the members of the sorcerer warriors twice!"</p>

  <p>"The real strength of the sorcerer race is almost exponential and immeasurable. What's the point of hiding in the great world?" Preston asked, his face becoming grim as a frown took over his face.</p>

  <p>Preston originally brought Ning Yudie with him to keep them away from danger, but now, it seemed like they had run into an even greater danger.</p>

  <p>But they were desperate and choosing to flee to the Lower World was the only right choice at that moment. They had no other choice then.</p>

  <p>The problem now was what they should do about the sorcerer warriors that were chasing after them like wild ferocious animals.</p>

  <p>After getting enough rest, Preston recovered seventy percent of his strength. But it was not sufficient enough to drive all the small skulls away. If this kept up, they would surely die a slow gruesome death.</p>

  <p>If only a Supreme Lord would come around and help them. That would be their only chance to survive.</p>

  <p>Going back to the ascending passageway and returning to the supreme world was out of the equation, too. It wouldn't work as they were likely to die first before they could even reach the passageway.</p>

  <p>Regardless whether the sorcerer warriors that invaded the Pure Jade Sacred Place had been cleared or not, if they tried to return to the ascending passageway, their pursuers would definitely catch up and eliminate them before they could make a move.</p>

  <p>They were really caught in a dilemma right now!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie sighed, feeling weary and hopeless. "Let's just move on and see what our fates have in store for us..."</p>

  <p>She bit her lip, fighting back the urge to cry. She really wanted to return to the Cloud Hall to see Imogen and her son, Geoffrey, whom she missed every day, but she was left with no plausible options.</p>

  <p>At this moment, she couldn't see any way out of this dilemma.</p>

  <p>In fact, when she traveled down the ascending passageway with the sorcerer warriors giving chase from behind, she worried about the ramifications of her actions. The great world wasn't big. Would it bring trouble to the Central Region if she led these warriors into the great world?</p>

  <p>She could choose to retreat, or even die in the ascending passageway, but it was impossible for Preston and the thousand core disciples of the Pure Jade Sacred Place to make such a debilitating sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Yudie's mind was in extreme disarray. She had no idea how she should deal with this situation. She tried to come up with solutions, only to draw blank. Instead, she became even more confused.</p>

  <p id="top_19"><a id="p9825" class="calibre2"></a>She sat on the ground, her slender arms wrapping around her knees protectively as desperation filled her chest. She buried her head in her chest, letting out the tears that welled in her eyes. Once again, she was helpless, with no one by her side to help her out. She'd never felt as alone as she had now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was probably still in the Upper World...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, caravans lined the passageways as all sorts of different materials from the York Divine Kingdom were shipped into the palace.</p>

  <p>Many of these items were precious materials that the York Divine Kingdom had accumulated for countless of years. Some of them had been sent here from the other three divine kingdoms as they had also learned about the arrival of the warriors from the Upper World. The four divine kingdoms were in the same continent, so they knew they couldn't just sit by and do nothing.</p>

  <p>When these supplies were sent to the palace to be given away to the warriors from the Upper World, Brennan's heart sank.</p>

  <p>There was a ten-thousand-year-old fleece-flower root, a hundred-thousand-year-old Blood Moon Crystal, and even a bundle of various precious herbs... All of them were priceless!</p>

  <p>However, very quickly, Brennan's face cleared as the things that he sent in were not of any interest to them.</p>

  <p>Only a few of them randomly chose some materials. Most of them only picked up some items, took a look and then threw them to the side.</p>

  <p>Knowing this, Brennan felt a little disappointed... After all, these people were important figures from the Upper World. He thought that if he could establish good relationship with them now, then there was a high chance that he could benefit from them in the future once he ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, what Brennan did not know was that there were a lot of supreme worlds connected to the ascending passageway of the great world. Even if he did manage to ascend to the Upper World in the future, the chances of him landing in the Pure Jade Sacred Place were slim and very small.</p>

  <p>Sitting on a high platform, Preston turned his attention to the core disciples who were quietly resting below. Seeing their looks of defeat frustrated him and awakened his desire to find a way out of their current predicament. Out of the blue, a look of determination flashed across his face as he clenched his fists.</p>

  <p>Conviction flared deep in his chest. He was still one of the top warriors within the entire Pure Jade Sacred Place. There was no way he would sit back and wait for their impending death.</p>

  <p>Preston abruptly rose to his feet and, with a deep breath, shouted,</p>

  <p>"Everyone!"</p>

  <p>All the core disciples were startled and directed their eyes toward Preston, who looked at them with fire burning in his eyes.</p>
