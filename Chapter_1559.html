  <p>
</p>

  <p>The surrounding conditions or situations of the two main cities that Luo Luo Zheng had passed through were entirely different from each other.</p>

  <p>Social circumstances, like the personalities and habits of the various races, were some of these related differences.</p>

  <p>The ogres, for example, were truly aggressive by nature. And since they had already entered the Illusion Battlefield, their brutish character became dominant, causing them to fight fiercely with each other.</p>

  <p>However, humans were in a so-called "centralized" state. In Lucille's city, the prevalence of occasional wars among the warriors happened regularly. But the vast majority of the Illusion Points obtained in these sporadic fights were being taken by Lucille's eight subordinates to be handed over to Lucille.</p>

  <p>She was the veritable city lord. Everyone could cut each other's throat, but in the end, everyone had to "pay taxes" to her.</p>

  <p>Under the suppression of Lucille, she maintained order within the main city of humans. If it weren't for her control, human warriors would continuously fight each other, making the whole city be in a state of chaos!</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the main city of the Demon Night was entirely in a state of order!</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was primitively a race that strictly followed orders.</p>

  <p>There were very few conflicts between the members, so they were always united against the outsiders when they were attacked or encountered other bad things.</p>

  <p>There weren't many warriors in the main city of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Nearly half of the warriors left the city to explore the infinite wilderness outside. And to obtain some Illusion Points, they killed the beasts in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Demon Night would also issue some challenges to each other. However, they would fight somewhere outside the city after being invited by their opponents. But other warriors would not participate in the battle or suddenly attack anyone.</p>

  <p>Seeing such an order in the city, Luo Luo Zheng was sensible in not directly attacking others to get Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Although there were a large number of warriors of the Demon Night around the city, they weren't that cautious of Luo Luo Zheng. In this city where everyone complied with the rules, the newcomers were also expected to abide by them.</p>

  <p>There were also a small number of ogre warriors and human warriors going in and out of the city gate. They also strictly followed the rules and didn't randomly plunder other warriors' Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>"It seems like I've come to the wrong place..."</p>

  <p>A depressed expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face. The biggest function of the Teleportation Token was to allow him to teleport to different main cities.</p>

  <p>In this kind of situation, Luo Luo Zheng would only need to travel to different main cities and kill warriors, so that he would be able to acquire a considerable amount of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>However, most of the warriors in the city of the Demon Night had gone to the wilderness to kill fierce beasts. But the number of Illusion Points they had accumulated was not much. The points were scattered among them and were not gathered together by one warrior.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, having found a corner, once again took out the Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the token, which looked like a white jade, was shrouded in a layer of a black Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>'This Teleportation Token can't be used continuously. Once it is used, it would take some time to wait for the black Mu Ning to dissipate before I can use it again. I won't be able to leave even if I want to, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>It suddenly came to his mind that there were two other cities located in the north and northwest parts of the main city. And they were not too distant from his current location. Approximately, he could probably reach one of the two cities in a short time.</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, Luo Luo Zheng didn't linger any longer and quickly left the city gate, heading towards the north.</p>

  <p>He hoped to find a city of the ogre or a city of another race in the north.</p>

  <p>After all, an awful lot of Illusion Points only existed at the place where there were more deadly and intense battles.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Luo Zheng was on his way out, he noticed that there were groups of warriors gathered on the side!</p>

  <p>Studying them from afar, he concluded that most of them were warriors of the Demon Night. He further noted that there were also two or three human warriors present. They all stood there, looking into the distance as if they were waiting for something.</p>

  <p>The strength of the warriors in front of him was of a mediocre level.</p>

  <p>Even if he killed them all, he would only accumulate 20, 000 to 30, 000 Illusion Points at the most. And if he took action there, he would be besieged and attacked by many other warriors.</p>

  <p>After some thought, Luo Luo Zheng decided to leave the scene as he had nothing to do with them.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to set off, he realized three streaks of light flew over. As he observed, they were three warriors of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>"About eight thousand miles away from the north gate, there is a forest.</p>

  <p>Many Iron Scale Spiders are growing in that forest, and killing one would obtain eighty Illusion Points, so twenty warriors should form a group to hunt those spiders."</p>

  <p>Soon after the Demon Night member had finished speaking, the gathered warriors all agreed and eagerly wanted to form a team to go to the forest to kill the Iron Scale Spiders.</p>

  <p>"Is this... still the Illusion Battlefield?"</p>

  <p>Having witnessed this harmonious scene, Luo Luo Zheng unexpectedly realized that he seemed not to have an in-depth knowledge of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>If this Illusion Battlefield was designed exclusively for the battles among warriors, then more battle rings could be arranged for them to compete with each other instead.</p>

  <p>In actuality, the Illusion Battlefield was divided into fifty supreme worlds. In addition to the main cities, there was also a featured vast space fitted for exploration.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had earned quite a lot of Illusion Points outside of the ogre city by attacking the Celestial Mice.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, in this vast world, there should be numerous secret areas for the warriors to explore.</p>

  <p>Indeed, there were many different ways and methods to obtain Illusion Points. And these warriors of the Demon Night adopted the division of labor and cooperation methods. They would constantly explore space in groups to conquer and accumulate a lot of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng didn't know was that the one who ranked ninety-seventh on the list was someone who hadn't killed a single warrior.</p>

  <p>In any sense, it wasn't that this warrior was weak. But on the contrary, his strength wasn't any weaker either than the ace talents of the various great races. It was just that from the start, he obtained a lot of Illusion Points by exploring the wilderness out of the main city, and slaying an enormous number of vicious beasts, including several powerful legendary beasts.</p>

  <p>The three warriors that had appeared earlier were tasked to search outside for their next possible exploration. After finding the target, they returned shortly to the main city and gathered other warriors to go with them.</p>

  <p>The Iron Scale Spider was considered a beast but lacked great power and strength! So almost half of the warriors there were willing to go and hunt this kind of spider. Only a small number of the warriors remained silent as if they didn't give a damn about the eighty Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>The second warrior of the Demon Night continued, "Thirteen thousand miles to the northwest, there is an abandoned tower. Inside the tower, there are many Shadow Evil Spirits. I have killed Shadow Evil Spirits on the first floor and obtained three hundred Illusion Points... It is better for at least nine warriors to go there together. This tower has a total of seven floors."</p>

  <p>On the first floor, there were already three hundred Illusion Points within the Shadow Evil Spirits. Without a doubt, exploring this abandoned tower was a lot more difficult than hunting spiders in the forest.</p>

  <p>"I'll go!"</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>"I want to go too!"</p>

  <p>Even so, there were still many warriors who were willing to go together.</p>

  <p>The two human warriors also expressed their willingness to go together.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also seemed interested in it.</p>

  <p>While the Teleportation Token could not be used now, he had originally planned to head towards the cities in the north. If he were to follow them to the abandoned tower, it would be a good idea.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Luo Zheng also planned to join this team.</p>

  <p>But before Luo Luo Zheng could say anything, the third warrior of the Demon Night spoke, "Directly to the north of the city, there is a Deadwood Gate twenty-four thousand miles away. We need urgent assistance. Those who are willing to join and successfully rescue Amber and Aurora would get five hundred thousand Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>As the warriors present heard these words, all of them had every intention of joining the rescue.</p>

  <p>Five hundred thousand Illusion Points were already enough for many warriors. This number was enough for them to rank in the top ten million in the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>But this Deadwood Gate was a rather dangerous place. Now that the warriors were asked to go there for the emergency rescue, they were confused as to what had happened.</p>

  <p>One of the warriors asked, "Amber and Aurora have led the elites of the main city to explore there, right? Did they fail?"</p>

  <p>The Demon Night's warrior shook her head and replied, "No. They did not fail, but encountered a sudden attack from another group. Most of the members of that group are ogres. Amber and Aurora are trapped inside the Deadwood Gate. They are in great danger now!"</p>

  <p>"It is the ogres that do such an evil thing again!"</p>

  <p>"Those despicable ogres only want to rob others..."</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to go to the Deadwood Gate!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't that the Demon Night members didn't have the strength to plunder other warriors' Illusion Points at all, but they didn't like to fight for anything by nature, nor did they like to expand.</p>

  <p>Thus, this exceptional, powerful race only occupied a bit over three hundred supreme worlds in the Upper World. Their territory was not expansive, severely not in proportion with their strength!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't care about this. He just paid attention to the name "Amber" that the warrior of the Demon Night mentioned.</p>
