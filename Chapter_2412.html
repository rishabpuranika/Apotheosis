<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before coming to the Sunrest Tree Region, Hallet had already informed Zheng about the detailed procedures of the debate over Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The number of True Gods who wanted to participate was huge.</p>

  <p>Not a lot of people had the opportunity to come to the Sunrest Tree Region because it was relatively far.</p>

  <p>However, there were still a few strong-minded True Gods who were willing to travel thousands of miles and spend all their money just to participate in the debate.</p>

  <p>This was despite the fact that they might not even qualify.</p>

  <p>Nearly ninety percent of True Gods would stop in a divine city and did not have the qualifications of climbing the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>Try as they might, their climb would be marred with countless tests from the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>In the end, only a few hundred would be deemed worthy and have the privilege of participating in the debate. Those who managed to get all the way to the end were mostly from powerful clans.</p>

  <p>Only a few ordinary True Gods could really talk about the Godly Ways in the center of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>Incredibly large and mighty, the Sunrest Tree grew countless branches that took root in the sea, eighty-seven of which extended all the way to the shore.</p>

  <p>Beside each of these eighty-seven roots were eighty-seven divine cities that the Sword Clan built. One of them was the Famous Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>These divine cities would serve as the bases for the temporary selection of candidates during the debates. It was there that they deliberated over those with the most potential to be sent to the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>This was also one of the main tasks of every city lord.</p>

  <p>Hayden had just taken office as acting lord of the Famous Sword Divine City and was eager to consolidate his position through achievements.</p>

  <p>He hoped to find around one or two qualified True Gods to participate in the debate.</p>

  <p>However, this was easier said than done.</p>

  <p>The number of truly knowledgeable ordinary True Gods was very few.</p>

  <p>Among those recommended by the eighty-seven divine cities, only around fifty to sixty managed to participate. The rate was actually less than one in each divine city!</p>

  <p>The Famous Sword Divine City was relatively remote and Hayden decided to personally participate in the selection this time.</p>

  <p>What he didn't expect was Zheng's unusual behaviour back when he observed with Marley at the city gate.</p>

  <p>The young man actually had the original of a golden Sanskrit word and was even able to actually convey the meanings of the two words sold by the gate accurately.</p>

  <p>But the moment Zheng entered the city, he started acting like a rookie, which confused Hayden greatly.</p>

  <p>"I've gotten a general picture," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Since you came for the debate, then you should have come prepared. I was quite impressed by your comments at the city gate, but why is it that you do not know any common Sanskrit words? Do you truly not know any?"</p>

  <p>There were numerous Sanskrit words that were well renowned by anyone, and everyone but Zheng didn't seem to know any of them, not even the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River. This confused Hayden and Marley greatly.</p>

  <p>Zheng only smiled. "In my opinion, Sanskrit word is something that comes from extraordinary creatures. We can't pretend to know what we don't know; however, the True Gods in the divine land forcibly interpret the Sanskrit words in their own ways and even divide them into different classes. Do they really understand these Sanskrit words?"</p>

  <p>His question stumped Marley.</p>

  <p>Across from them, Hayden suddenly clapped and had a huge grin on his face. "Not bad! Such opinion is very stirring! We should not have made up so many strange names for Sanskrit words. It is really a mistake!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's comments were actually what most great masters who studied Sanskrit words had observed.</p>

  <p>These masters had profound opinions about Sanskrit words and even had experience in deciphering them but they were exceedingly rare. They were often disdainful of sects and addresses set by ordinary True Gods.</p>

  <p>Neither Hayden nor Marley knew that when Zheng had just become a nature creature, he had already seen golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>He did not study these words systematically, like what the True Gods did in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Bromley left behind a lot of opinions about Sanskrit words but Zheng did not have the time to digest them. Instead, he spent more time on his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey, who was only in his teens, had begun to decipher those Sanskrit words instead. He gave Zheng an illusion that deciphering them was not such a difficult task.</p>

  <p>It was only after he arrived at the Famous Sword Divine City that Zheng realized that it wasn't easy at all. It was only because his son was so talented.</p>

  <p>Before he even figured out what was going on, Hayden and Marley already treated him as a master.</p>

  <p>With Hayden's invitation, Zheng was made to spend the night at his house.</p>

  <p>The next day, Hayden personally led him to the west gate.</p>

  <p>The Famous Sword Divine City's west gate was located at the edge of the sea. Once one got out of the gate, he would be able to step on the very stem of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>This gate was normally closed.</p>

  <p>Only the disciples of the Sword Clan were qualified enough to enter.</p>

  <p>Once the debate began, all divine cities would go through the first round of screening. Those who passed would then be able to climb up the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>When Hayden brought Zheng to the gate, they saw a long queue!</p>

  <p>Countless True Gods lined up, all waiting for the screening of the Famous Sword Divine City. There were so many people that over a hundred guards were needed to maintain order.</p>

  <p>"So many True Gods," Zheng murmured, a bit stunned at the extremely long line.</p>

  <p>The queue of True Gods started from the west gate and went dozens of miles long. He wondered just how long it would take to screen them all.</p>

  <p>Hayden was used to this scene but upon seeing the astonishment on Zheng's face, he felt the need to explain. "The first round of screening for the debate will last at least half a year. This amount is actually quite small. There are bound to be more people as time goes on until the line reaches the outer part of the city."</p>

  <p>His words rendered Zheng almost speechless.</p>

  <p>"So you mean to say that it will take a few months for these people to be screened?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Hayden laughed. "Not just a few months. The True Gods in the front came here and lined up two or three years ago. The first ones had already lined up as soon as the last debate came to an end. That would make it around more than ten years."</p>

  <p>It was preposterous!</p>

  <p>"There's nothing we can do. Some guys aren't even here for the debate at all. They seize seats and sell to the True Gods who may need it. Those in the front can easily get hundreds of divine might coins upon selling their seats to disciples of powerful clans," Hayden said helplessly.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods worked hard but did not earn as many divine might coins as they would've liked.</p>

  <p>Time, however, wasn't that valuable to them. Since they could still cultivate while queuing up here, then they simply did so.</p>

  <p>Noticing the look on Zheng's face, Hayden quickly gave him a reassuring smile. "Relax. I personally recommend you, so there is no need to line up behind all these people."</p>

  <p>With that, he quickly took Zheng past the queue.</p>

  <p>Three True Gods, dressed in white robes, sat upright in front of the west gate. Engraved on the ground was a very strange circular array.</p>

  <p>This array was around 100 feet in diameter and its lines were made of long swords, piled up together but leaving a path in the middle.</p>

  <p>Some strange power emanated from this array.</p>

  <p>One of the three white-robed True Gods waved his hand at the first True God in the queue, motioning him to enter.</p>

  <p>The True God momentarily paused before taking a deep breath and then stepping into the array.</p>

  <p>As he stepped into the array, all the swords began to vibrate and his body began to tremble.</p>

  <p>However, after taking the first step, he seemed to be unable to take another one.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, the True God opened his eyes and had a look of fear on his face. He quickly retreated from the array and collapsed on the ground, looking very awkward.</p>
