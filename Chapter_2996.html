  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Zheng entered the Wild Goose Pass, he had met the Mice League and the Man-eating Demon Flower.</p>

  <p>However, he had always believed in the dominance of humans, so it was difficult for him to accept the case in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Although the people of the Sword Light Palace did not show any interest in occupying the Gracious Province, they had once sent their warriors to exterminate the Man-eating Demon Flowers in the province.</p>

  <p>Although unable to move, the Man-eating Demon Flower reproduced rapidly. Every Man-eating Demon Flower could produce millions of seeds, and they could thrive even in such harsh environments like the desert.</p>

  <p>They would be seen everywhere again several years after the Sword Light Palace had exterminated them.</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand years ago, the Sword Light Palace had no time to pay attention to the Gracious Province due to its own problems. Therefore, a Man-eating Demon Flower had insidiously reached the Other Shore Realm and kept growing. As time went by, it integrated an Other Shore Token from the Stage Fifteen, becoming the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers. As a result, the monstrous flower and its seeds became even more difficult to eradicate.</p>

  <p>The Man-eating Demon Flowers were very intelligent, and they used a unique system to support people of the Sand Country, who worshiped the flowers as gods.</p>

  <p>A large number of Sand Country folks willingly offered themselves as sacrifices to the beastly blooms because they considered it a supreme honor to do so.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace tried to stop people of the Sand Country, but the people considered them as enemies and attacked them. In the end, the palace could only let the Man-eating Demon Flowers grow widely in the desert.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, they mistake our goodwill for ill intent." The woman named Laura murmured. The deathly pallor of her skin had been replaced by the faintest flush of color, making her look radiant.</p>

  <p>She did not force Zheng to tell her where he came from but went on explaining to him the structure of the Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>After she finished, Zheng sighed. It seemed like the Source World was much more complicated than he had originally surmised.</p>

  <p>"Will the king of Man-eating Demon Flowers attack us?" Zheng looked ahead with a hint of worry in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Man-eating Demon Flower's body stretched for as long as a hundred thousand miles. If it raised its body high in the air, it could tear the flying ship into pieces.</p>

  <p>"It is powerful enough to rule the world here, but it doesn't dare to provoke the ships flying past. It won't deliberately antagonize us or the influential caravans, because it knows that it will get into trouble with us by doing so.</p>

  <p>It's not stupid," Laura said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Her excitement drove her to speak much more fluently than before.</p>

  <p>The three men garbed in cyan robes in the front of the flying ship stared at them, murmuring inwardly.</p>

  <p>In their opinion, Zheng was nobody special, just someone who had cultivated a lot of Godly Ways. That meant nothing. In the Source World, reaching the Other Shore Realm was the real starting point.</p>

  <p>They were curious as to why Laura, who was generally not a talkative character, continued talking with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the flying ship finally passed the colossal king of Man-eating Demon Flowers. Waves of space spread out around the flying ship, enveloping it. Then, the flying ship entered the void.</p>

  <p>The Gracious Province was small, but its space was astonishingly large. To save time, they had to use Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>A clear river flowed in front of the Excellence City. The sweet, refreshing water fed many divine citizens around the city.</p>

  <p>The Eremopoa Desert was located at the end of the river.</p>

  <p>The Evil God walked along the edge of the dune. He narrowed his eyes and let the hot sand kiss his face.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me... Sir... Can you take me to the Excellence City?" A man's voice interrupted the Evil God's reverie.</p>

  <p>The man looked very weak and exhausted. He was panting for breath, and his lips were dry and cracked.</p>

  <p>Standing beside the dune, the Evil God looked the man up and down with an indescribable expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sir..." The man crawled slowly on the dune and finally reached the feet of the Evil God. "Help me... I have no energy left..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God kept looking at the man, saying nothing.</p>

  <p>Then, a wicked smile appeared on his handsome face. "Interesting! The human beings in the outside world are the same. They also lie."</p>

  <p>"What... What do you mean?" the man asked in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>"What a cheap trick!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't bother to explain how he saw through the man's ruse.</p>

  <p>As he opened his mouth, a ruthless aura burst out from him.</p>

  <p>He slowly squatted down, grabbed the man's neck and lifted him up.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Evil God's cruel face, the man showed a panicked expression.</p>

  <p>He was very weak just then, but now he desperately cried out in a loud voice, "Help me! This guy wants to kill me..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish his words, he felt an extremely hot aura coming over from the Evil God's hand and blacked out.</p>

  <p>That theurgy beyond way was the Unknown Fire, which was created by the Evil God. The fire was hot and formless. It would not release light even at night. Its power might be very ordinary, but it was extremely difficult to detect and block.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Just as the man called for help, dozens of mounds appeared in the surrounding sand dunes, like something was quickly passing underneath them.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the Evil God again manically smiled. Then, he lifted the man in his hand and slammed him hard on the ground.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Then, a strange scene occurred; the man in his hand instantly became dehydrated, appearing little more than a husk of his former self.</p>

  <p>The Unknown Fire released by the Evil God had burned the man's blood, flesh, bones, and brain. His body was now filled with the Unknown Fire.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God banged him onto the ground, all of the Unknown Fire in the man's body rushed into the ground and surged under the desert.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>"What kind of fire is this?"</p>

  <p>"I'm burning!"</p>

  <p>As it turned out, people of the Sand Country were beneath those dunes.</p>

  <p>Their cultivation base was not low, and most of them were top-rank True Gods. They had the advantage in numbers, so they not only lured outsiders but also directly attacked them.</p>

  <p>However, they encountered the Evil God this time, so they were out of luck.</p>

  <p>They crawled out of the ground and rolled around on the dunes. Their bodies were charred by the Unknown Fire, but no flames were seen.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they were killed by the Unknown Fire.</p>

  <p>Among the charred corpses, a person managed to survive. The Evil God slowly walked toward him.</p>

  <p>The fastest way to learn about this world was by reading the people's souls.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had had a conflict with a divine citizen before, so he slaughtered all of the residents in the citizen's village by the river. In this manner, he had obtained many memories of this world.</p>

  <p>However, the status of these divine citizens was too low, and they didn't have much experience. Therefore, the Evil God shifted his focus toward True Gods as his new targets.</p>
