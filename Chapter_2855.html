</p>

  <p>Killing a Holy Being was a very complicated process.</p>

  <p>It was a different story, however, when Pierson was determined to die to protect the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>A few seconds after he died, dull thunder resounded from the sky.</p>

  <p>It was the sound of a universe that was collapsing unto itself.</p>

  <p>It was Pierson who destroyed his universe by himself.</p>

  <p>Samuel looked up at the sky, as the dull thud of the collapsing universe sounded in his ears. He murmured with a mocking smirk, "This is the end of an ant. Even at the cost of his own life, he still couldn't get what he wanted."</p>

  <p>Rosie glanced at him but opted to remain quiet.</p>

  <p>After Pascal killed hundreds of people from the Dongfang Clan, the disciples of the Han Clan couldn't hold back any longer and rushed forward.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan had been in the leading position for many years. They were quite wealthy and had many rare treasures in their possession.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Han Clan didn't care about the animosity between Samuel and the Dongfang Clan. They rushed to the herbal garden as soon as they had the opportunity. They raided and snatched the pill formulas and the weapons of the Dongfang Clan like hungry locusts.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>They were running everywhere and left a mess anywhere they went.</p>

  <p>Someone smashed open a hall in his impatience, and hundreds of people immediately rushed in.</p>

  <p>Shouts and screams could be heard continuously. They plundered the place and even started to fight with each other.</p>

  <p>The elegant buildings of the Dongfang Clan were soon destroyed. The whole Floating Island was ruined as well.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Samuel could have taken over the whole Floating Island, but he wanted to vent his anger over the years, so he brought his people here.</p>

  <p>This was why, when Samuel saw the ruins left by their plunder, he was filled with great satisfaction. With a pleased smile, he left with Rosie and Pascal.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he appeared in the Hall of Holy Beings amidst the clouds.</p>

  <p>"Holy Beings! Show yourselves!" Samuel's commanding voice echoed in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>This was a place where Holy Beings gathered and communicated with each other.</p>

  <p>As Samuel spoke, his voice reached the ears of the Holy Beings. They had been watching the drama unfold on their Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans were all reborn in their universes, and the living ones were those who were unwilling to join the alliance.</p>

  <p>They frowned at Samuel. They were torn between happiness and anger as they saw what he did.</p>

  <p>In the past, they suffered a lot under the hands of the Dongfang Clan. Now, as they watched the Dongfang Clan be plundered, they were secretly overjoyed.</p>

  <p>However, they were not very pleased by Samuel at that moment. How could he summon other Holy Beings in such an arrogant and disrespectful way?</p>

  <p>Did he take the Holy Beings as his subordinates?</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings was different from the alliance of the powerful clans. Even Nicholas dared not order other Holy Beings when he was alive.</p>

  <p>"Samuel, the Hall of Holy Beings is only for us to communicate with each other. How could you order us like that?"</p>

  <p>"Samuel, what do you want to talk about today?"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>The voices of some of the Holy Beings could be heard from the Hall of Holy Beings, but none of them showed up.</p>

  <p>Samuel sneered, "Today, I'm going to rebuild the alliance of the powerful clans. I won't blame you if you don't want to show up, but you may have to move out of the Floating Islands!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings frowned deeper when they heard his answer. Even Nicholas wouldn't dare to talk so arrogantly.</p>

  <p>His attitude irked them, but some of them were afraid of his strength.</p>

  <p>When the alliance of the powerful clans entered the Abyss Demon Region, no news could be obtained. Samuel returned unharmed, but Nicholas died.</p>

  <p>As soon as he came back, he took his people and plundered the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan. Some of the Holy Beings could not help but wonder how he easily overpowered the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>"What if we refuse?"</p>

  <p>A dignified voice rang out. It was Woodruff from the War God Hall of the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan and the Sword Clan were both as rich and powerful as the Dongfang Clan. Nicholas died, but the Holy Beings of the two clans didn't.</p>

  <p>"Samuel, do you want to be our enemy?"</p>

  <p>"Can you alone challenge all the powerful clans? Don't kid yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what ace you've got in your sleeves, but do you want to start universe wars one after another?"</p>

  <p>Led by Woodruff, the Holy Beings of the Bai Clan, the Jiang Clan, and other powerful clans all chipped in threateningly.</p>

  <p>Nicholas died because the Furnace of Dark and Light collapsed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Pierson destroyed his universe to kill himself because he knew that the Dongfang Clan could not defeat Samuel.</p>

  <p>Samuel did not kill either of them directly.</p>

  <p>To kill Holy Beings, one had to start a universe war. However, a universe war had many rules and restrictions.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings could not participate in such wars directly.</p>

  <p>In a universe war, only three True Gods were allowed to exist. This rule had been modified by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Even though Samuel's strength was great, the creatures in his universe weren't as strong as him. Even if he launched a universe war and killed a Holy Being, it would exhaust the creatures in his universe. There was no way that he had the strength to start a second war.</p>

  <p>So the Holy Beings were not afraid of him at all. They ignored the proposal of rebuilding the alliance of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Enormous clouds were blown into the Hall of Holy Beings. They turned into a dense fog, but otherwise, nothing was amiss. After the sarcastic remarks, the Holy Beings ignored Samuel, and there was quiet in the hall.</p>

  <p>Samuel stood still, his eyes twitching in annoyance. A stormy expression had taken over his face.</p>

  <p>His first plan was to rule the Time Sea, but now, he realized that he was too naive.</p>

  <p>After a long silence, Samuel said angrily, "Before long, you will beg me to join the alliance of the powerful clans!"</p>

  <p>After that, he led Rosie and Pascal out of the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the center of the Evolutionary Universe, a peculiar view appeared.</p>

  <p>A dark red ball of light emitted sun-like radiance. It attracted the attention of countless people in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>All of them tried to guess the origin of the red light ball, but they couldn't think of anything.</p>

  <p>Some Supreme Lords were curious about the light ball, as they traveled through the universe with their physical bodies. Their curiosity got the best of them, and they tried to approach it.</p>

  <p>However, before they could get close to it, they felt a unique aura. The aura was very kind, but it could not be resisted. It stopped anyone from approaching the red light ball.</p>

  <p>In a secret place of the Celestial Position race, Wynn looked at the scene in the sky. His face was bright with excitement.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this? Why are you so excited, Master Wynn?" Master Feng asked.</p>

  <p>He had also tried to explore the secret of the light ball, but he failed. In the end, he returned to the Celestial Position race and asked Wynn for help.</p>

  <p>He did not expect Wynn to be ecstatic at the sight of the light ball in the sky.</p>

  <p>"My master! My master is reborn! My master finally comes back to life!</p>

  <p>We made it! Zheng made it! He hasn't been in the divine land for long. How fast!" Wynn was so excited that he could not even speak clearly.</p>

  <p>Master Feng tried to make sense of Wynn's words. He gasped when he realized what he meant.</p>

  <p>Wasn't Wynn's master the owner of the Evolutionary Universe? Not long after Zheng left, he had managed to save his father. What a surprise!</p>
