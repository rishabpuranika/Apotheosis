<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1938 Luo Zheng's Breakthrough </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A cave of Valley of Time was completely sealed. Luo Luo Zheng was inside the cave, completely unaware of the situation outside.</p>

  <p>All these years, he often took the shape of an avatar to explore his inner world and develop it.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, a martial artist did not interfere with their own inner world. The creatures within the inner world formed an ecological chain and thrived.</p>

  <p>A powerful creature could be born only under certain circumstances. If Luo Luo Zheng interfered and provided them with too many resources, then the creatures in the inner world would be incomparably weak. Even their rate of reproduction would start declining.</p>

  <p>Ever since the World Tree had extended its roots into the chaos, it had been able to draw out endless amount of chaotic energy, which was a huge benefit for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The chaotic sea continued to expand, and the central continent continued to evolve. The time within his inner world quickly moved forward.</p>

  <p>The situation on the continent became complicated.</p>

  <p>The Howe Clan and the Totem Clan had already turned into an imprint in history.</p>

  <p>The queen of the Howe Clan that Luo Luo Zheng had once rescued, left behind a glorious divine kingdom. Later, it divided itself into three divine kingdoms on the continent.</p>

  <p>As for the Howe Clan, when it was split up, it formed many sacred places of varying proportions. In one of the sacred places, the first warrior at the Soul Sea Realm was created.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The edge of Luo Zheng's inner world was still in a state of chaos.</p>

  <p>Some intelligent sea creatures were curious about the edge of this world.</p>

  <p>They swam forward, following the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a strange phenomenon happened. No matter how long one swam in this sea, they could never reach the end. It was as if the chaotic sea was endless.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the moment one turned around, they would instantly return to the starting point, as if the world was an endless cycle of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not the only cultivator to be in such situation. The other cultivators also faced similar situations within their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>However, this time the situation was different. The group of sea creatures swimming at the edge of the chaotic sea felt a vigorous force descending upon them.</p>

  <p>The chaotic sea began to stir up violent storms, forming into massive walls.</p>

  <p>Initially, the sea creatures panicked, but soon they calmed down.</p>

  <p>Although the storm was fierce, it came to a halt at the edge of the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Several months later, the storm vanished. And at the edge of the chaotic sea, a grayish-brown curtain of light began to form. This curtain of light began to absorb the chaotic energy frantically.</p>

  <p>"Form the boundaries!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was at a crucial juncture. Sitting upright in the cave, he placed both his hands on top of his belly, while his eyes brimmed with vitality.</p>

  <p>The Primal Chaos Technique was only to guide him, and so far he had progressed step by step, relying on his own exploration and comprehension.</p>

  <p>Breaking through to become a world lord was the most crucial step.</p>

  <p>The light barrier at the edge of the chaotic sea was still extremely weak.</p>

  <p>With the impact of the tide, cracks appeared on some parts of the barrier.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, after this curtain of light absorbed the chaotic energy, it also began to continuously release the boundary-forming power, repairing the damage and the cracks that had appeared.</p>

  <p>From this moment on, there were only fifteen days left before the agreed time with Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>The other Godly Geniuses had already left their caves and were waiting for Luo Luo Zheng to come out of his seclusion in the Valley of Time. Although the faint fragrance of the Valley of Time was able to calm the minds of martial artists, they were still anxious and restless.</p>

  <p>Even Nathan had a look of worry on his face. All of them had gone through the experience in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and possessed the cultivation of a world lord. They had also received the inheritance of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Both their strength and state of mind had changed drastically.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the only genius who hadn't made a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>Nathan might not want to admit the truth, but Luo Luo Zheng was after all the leader of these Godly Geniuses. This trip to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had taken three years. Luo Luo Zheng was the only one that hadn't become a world lord. A fact that even Nathan couldn't believe.</p>

  <p>"There is half a month left in the outside world, but there's still more than three years left for Luo Luo Zheng. There's no need to be so anxious!" Lucille said with a smile. Of the Godly Geniuses, she was one of the three to enter the Harmony race to cultivate.</p>

  <p>The Mind Refining Tower of the Harmony race was able to temper a martial artist's mind. Currently, Lucille's temperament was even more elegant and tranquil, making her appear more attractive.</p>

  <p>"But Luo Luo Zheng has yet to break through. He must have encountered some trouble. Perhaps he has come across some obstacles that he is unable to overcome," Nathan retorted.</p>

  <p>Tianming, on the other hand, had a calm expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Out of the Godly Geniuses present, he was probably the only one who understood Luo Luo Zheng the most.</p>

  <p>After they entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Jay had spent maximum efforts on Luo Luo Zheng and him. But Tianming also understood that he was far less important than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, there was no need to doubt Luo Zheng's breakthrough to the realm of a world lord. He wasn't even the least bit worried.</p>

  <p>Besides worrying about Luo Luo Zheng, these Godly Geniuses were also worrying about the war in the universe.</p>

  <p>All these Godly Geniuses had extraordinary origins. Their loved ones and their benefactors were all mighty warriors of the universe. When the Sacred race invaded the universe, these warriors were unavoidably involved in the war. Yet these Godly Geniuses were confined in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and were unable to understand the situation of the entire universe. They were naturally worried.</p>

  <p>Fifteen days left...</p>

  <p>Fourteen days left...</p>

  <p>Thirteen days left...</p>

  <p>While in seclusion, they felt that time was moving at a very slow pace.</p>

  <p>But once outside, they felt like half a month had passed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Five days left...</p>

  <p>Three days left...</p>

  <p>On the third day of the countdown, a strange phenomenon appeared above the Valley of Time.</p>

  <p>The vitality between heaven and earth began to fluctuate violently.</p>

  <p>"He broke through!" A hint of excitement could be seen in Lucille's beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"Amitabha. That is definitely the boundary-forming power. Finally Luo Luo Zheng has succeeded!" Kurt nodded his head with a pleased expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Godly Geniuses were not the only ones paying attention to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Flyer race was also very concerned. Although they didn't think highly of the final person who broke through, they were curious as to how large a Boundary Cloud that person could form.</p>

  <p>Other than the Dragon Flyer race, there was also a pair of eyes staring at this scene from the highest point of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. It was Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>'This little guy cultivates chaotic energy. Logically speaking, the world he creates should be the elementary form of a divine land. So this is equivalent to forming a divine land! I wonder just how much vitality between heaven and earth will he be able to draw in?' Holy Jay thought about it.</p>

  <p>He did not use an avatar to come here, but used his inner vision to spy on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Suddenly the crowd heard a rumbling sound coming from above the Valley of Time.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of explosion that resonated within the surrounding vitality between heaven and earth. A ring-shaped Boundary Cloud appeared in the sky and began to spread outwards.</p>

  <p>However, the speed at which the Boundary Cloud spread, was not that fast as compared to Tianming's, Nathan's, Lawson's, Lone's and the others'.</p>

  <p>But the Godly Geniuses and the Dragon Flyer warriors were shocked to see this Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>The Boundary Cloud that formed from the vitality between heaven and earth, had a hue of light yellow color. From Nathan to Lone, all their Boundary Clouds shone in light yellow color. However, Luo Zheng's Boundary Cloud was different? it was grayish brown!</p>

  <p>"What's with Luo Zheng's Boundary Cloud? That is a very peculiar color," Karl asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Why is this Boundary Cloud colored differently?" Lawson also asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Nathan also looked perplexed as the ring spread slowly. "It is said that when a martial artist with Purple Power Body breaks through to become a world lord, the color of the Boundary Cloud will be a light purple color. But I haven't heard about a grayish-brown Boundary Cloud!"</p>

  <p>The Dragon Flyer warriors were even more shocked looking at the sight in front of them.</p>

  <p>There were many world lords in the Valley of Time. The Dragon Flyer warriors' research on the Boundary Cloud was much more profound than any other race.</p>

  <p>"Why does this person have this sort of strange Boundary Cloud?"</p>

  <p>"What kind of cultivation technique is this? Even the sound is so loud!"</p>

  <p>"However, judging by the situation, the Boundary Cloud will not cover much distance. At most, it won't exceed five miles. You're right. His talent is a bit weaker than the other warriors'!"</p>
