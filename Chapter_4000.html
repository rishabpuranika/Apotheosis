<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being controlling Zheng's physical body quickly climbed to the top of the pagoda mountain from the front and slid down from the back.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>It was on the mountainside when it stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes glittered with excitement, his voice rising an octave. "Yes, it is right here!"</p>

  <p>"But there is nothing here!" Zheng said in confusion, looking around.</p>

  <p>But before Zheng could finish speaking, the Treacherous Being controlling his body hefted a mighty slap at the pagoda mountain.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Although these pagoda mountains were made of stone, they were covered with dust and soil as time went by.</p>

  <p>After the Treacherous Being had launched a palm strike, the thin layer of soil on the surface of the mountain shattered, revealing a huge red copper disk. The surface of the copper disk was engraved with intricate patterns.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The surface of the red copper disk glowed when a thick light film covered it.</p>

  <p>"What should we do next?" Zheng asked in his mind. "Do we really need to push this pagoda mountain over?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile. "There are four pagoda mountains in all that need to be overturned. I had spent a lot of time and energy at the time to find these four mountains."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the Treacherous Being maneuvered Zheng's body so that it slammed viciously into the red copper disk.</p>

  <p>The light film on the surface of the disk was solid. The power released in a collision could reach a million divine megatons, but it failed to break the light film.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The collision between Zheng's body and the red copper disk produced a huge shock wave that rippled outwards and also affected the surrounding pagoda mountains.</p>

  <p>The surfaces of these pagoda mountains were covered in soil.</p>

  <p>The shock wave shattered the soil on the surface of each pagoda mountain, revealing what lay underneath. Each mountain was actually a tall pagoda made of red copper metal.</p>

  <p>"Are all these pagoda mountains made of metal?" Zheng asked, surprised, as he looked around at the copper pagoda mountains.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the nature was ingenious, but it was impossible to cast so many smooth pagoda mountains with metal.</p>

  <p>"All the pagoda mountains are like this," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, nodding. "These were man-made but we do not know who built them and why."</p>

  <p>Anything in the Three Purities Stage that couldn't be explained would be explained away as being related to the Instant Civilization.</p>

  <p>The blow from the Treacherous Being had caused the huge pagoda mountain to tilt a little.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to overturn such a huge metal pagoda mountain.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being then hit it for the second time, and then the third time, the fourth time...</p>

  <p>Every time they collided, the pagoda mountain would tilt a little more.</p>

  <p>When the pagoda mountain had tilted to a certain extent, Zheng was surprised to find that it was locked to the ground with gear wheels. At the bottom of the pagoda mountain were two small and one huge gear wheels. The two small ones were tightly connected to the huge one.</p>

  <p>"How could such things exist under the Myriad Pagoda Mountains?" The more Zheng looked at them, the more surprised he became.</p>

  <p>"It is ingenious!" Smiling, the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, "There are many gear wheels of different sizes buried in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. These are ingenious, but they are only used to open the door.</p>

  <p>The Instant Civilization has simpler and more intuitive methods of building the door. But they still put a lot of time and energy into making such complicated things."</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze turned to the distance where he saw countless pagoda mountains standing proudly, their edges invisible to the naked eye. "It is such a huge area and every part of it has been so carefully carved! This is simply mind-blowing!"</p>

  <p>"There was no point of them doing this. They just did it to kill time," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said meaningfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean..." Zheng uttered, his eyes lighting up.</p>

  <p>"The Instant Civilization was trapped here," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered Zheng's unasked question.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had known a part of the truth, he was not as thoughtful as the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others. The humans deduced from and restored every detail they found in the Three Purities Stage, hoping to find out more information. The Primeval Lord of Heaven was naturally much more knowledgeable than Zheng in this respect.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Only after repeated hits was the huge pagoda mountain finally overturned.</p>

  <p>But the moment it touched the ground, a loud mechanical click sounded from within the mountain.</p>

  <p>"There are huge spring pieces at the bottom of the pagoda mountain, which, when they bounce back, will slowly help the pagoda mountain stand up again. The process will take thirty-two hours," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained, before Zheng could ask a question.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to go into this underground space, they had to overturn four pagoda mountains within thirty-two hours. After thirty-two hours, the first pagoda mountain would bounce back into place.</p>

  <p>"This whole process is so precise." Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being looked around for a while and then headed north again.</p>

  <p>"We can get to the second pagoda mountain by moving three thousand miles to the north and then one thousand five hundred miles to the east," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>Just as the Primeval Lord of Heaven had explained, the Treacherous Being turned east after traveling north for three thousand miles. It then found another pagoda mountain one thousand five hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>The first pagoda mountain was huge. One could tell at a glance that it was unusual.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about the second pagoda mountain. It was by no means an easy task to look for it among the countless pagoda mountains.</p>

  <p>But it was as if the Treacherous Being could sense it, and it climbed up the mountain quickly.</p>

  <p>Just as it had done to the first pagoda mountain, the Treacherous Being began to slam its fist into the second pagoda mountain, causing it to fall to the ground, part by part.</p>

  <p>Once it had overturned the second pagoda mountain, the Treacherous Being maneuvered Zheng's body towards the northeast, in search of the third pagoda mountain.</p>

  <p>It had dealt with three pagoda mountains smoothly.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Pagoda Mountains looked desolate. There were no warriors from other races or beasts.</p>

  <p>The Wing King flew over the Blood Swamp, when the Treacherous Being was overturning these pagoda mountains.</p>

  <p>With the Wing King's help, the Snake Goddess and others were not afraid of the Soul Leeches and Worm Lizards in the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>But he didn't dare to fly too high!</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm Hunters were familiar with the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>There was a kind of evil bird that lived in the Blood Swamp, which, when it discovered a target, would emerge to attack it.</p>

  <p>The Wing King kept a low altitude and flew dangerously close to the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>He encountered several troubles along the way, but he managed to deftly dodge all of them.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Blood Swamp, the Wing King communicated with the Regal Jade Spirit through the Civilization Artifact again. After confirming Zheng's location, he went straight to the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>"The Myriad Pagoda Mountains should be the safest area in the Supreme Pure Realm. We have explored it before, but there are just huge copper mountains. There isn't anything magical about it," said Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't say anything. When she had last entered the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, she had felt this area to be unique, and her intuition had told her that there must be something underneath it all. She and Fuxi had also tried to break through a pagoda mountain, but hadn't found anything unusual.</p>
