<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nina was stunned. For so many years, the people of Shura Battlefield had worked hard to progress against the demons. Little by little, they had built two massive towers, the Heaven tower, and the Earth tower, to resist the demons. However, this time, the situation seemed to be unprecedentedly grim, as the demons had now occupied the two towers......</p>

  <p>Flying on the sword was faster than running on foot in the forest.</p>

  <p>Lennie directed the sword to carry them northwest. They flew like the wind, and soon, they reached their destination. Nina gasped as she saw a big white city.</p>

  <p>"It is the White Emperor City!"</p>

  <p>Since all the buildings and walls in the city were made of dolostone which was white and very hard, the city was called White Emperor City for its white color.</p>

  <p>Lennie and Nina landed at the gate of White Emperor City with Luo Zheng who was still comatose.</p>

  <p>Several soldiers appeared at the gate and, seeing Lennie, said respectfully, "Sir, if you want to enter the city, please show your jade token and accept our checks to let us make sure that you are not dressed up!"</p>

  <p>Lennie knew these rules, and so, he removed his token from his waist and handed it to the soldiers.</p>

  <p>After checking the token carefully, the soldiers returned it to Lennie.</p>

  <p>Then they waved at the other soldiers on the wall who were handling a big demon-revealing mirror.</p>

  <p>The demon-revealing mirror worked in the same way as the Demon-revealing Needle of the Zhu Clan. It could also tell when a demon was disguised as a human. In this way, it prevented demons from entering the White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Nina, and Lennie were checked in the demon-revealing mirror.</p>

  <p>After the confirmation, the soldiers bowed to show respect to Lennie and then opened the gate to let them in.</p>

  <p>As White Emperor City was an important military pass, all of its buildings were designed to defend against enemies. The city was hence, built to be functional not aesthetic.</p>

  <p>Since they weren't allowed to fly in the city, Lennie made a little silver sword out of his life vitality for Luo Zheng to lie on. Then, he and Nina walked beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Soon, they arrived in front of a low building.</p>

  <p>"Nina, Luo Zheng is seriously injured. Payne Xue is a highly skilled doctor in White Emperor City. If he agrees to help, Luo Zheng will heal quickly.</p>

  <p>However, it may cost us a lot of money!" Lennie whispered to his niece.</p>

  <p>Nina pouted and said, "Uncle, I will save Luo Zheng at any price, and if necessary, I will sell the Tai-Yi Moxa Stick that my grandpa gave me..."</p>

  <p>"No, no, you can't do that!" Lennie was astonished. The Tai-Yi Moxa Stick was a family heirloom of the Zhu Clan. He remembered that he didn't get the Tai-Yi Moxa Stick when he was young even though he had worked hard, but the master of the Zhu Clan, Bowen, loved his granddaughter Nina so much that he gave it to her.</p>

  <p>"Why can't I sell Tai-Yi Moxa Stick?" Nina asked feigning innocence.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, you can't sell it!" Lennie felt somewhat upset.</p>

  <p>But Nina went on to say, "Okay, then I will sell the Secret Box..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no......!" Lennie became more upset.</p>

  <p>"Then, how about the Ichthyosaur Pearl? Or the Double Star Loop?</p>

  <p>Or..."</p>

  <p>Hearing that Nina wanted to sell all the family heirlooms, Lennie seemed to be more crazy than upset.</p>

  <p>He cursed the family master, who spoiled Nina by giving her all these heirlooms.</p>

  <p>Finally, Lennie stopped Nina and said, "Okay. Okay! I will pay all the medical costs to save Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Nina smiled demurely.</p>

  <p>Then Lennie knocked on the door of the white building. After a few moments, a middle-aged man opened the door. Nina noted that he had a humpback and a mustache. When he smiled, his small eyes reflected wisdom.</p>

  <p>"Payne, I need your help," Lennie said softly.</p>

  <p>Seeing Lennie standing at the door, Payne Xue laughed sarcastically before speaking in a sharp voice, "Oh, it's you, Lennie! Last time we met, you declared that you would never ask me for help. Don't you remember?"</p>

  <p>It was now clear to Nina that the two men shared an unpleasant history.</p>

  <p>Payne was greedy. Even though he was a highly skilled doctor, he asked for too much money for his medical services.</p>

  <p>Lennie remembered the incident Payne had spoken of clearly. Lennie's comrade had been injured at the Shura Battlefield. When Lennie asked for help, Payne quoted an outrageous amount, which angered Lennie.</p>

  <p>And that was why Lennie had called Payne a high-skilled but avaricious doctor!</p>

  <p>Lennie also said that he would never ask Payne for help even if it meant that Lennie would die at the Shura Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"I will pay you whatever you charge, all right?" Lennie hummed reluctantly. If it had not been for Nina, Lennie would never have asked Payne for help.</p>

  <p>Payne said in a sharp voice, "Sure. Since I love money more than people, I will forget what you have said in the past, and help you. Heh heh!"</p>

  <p>Then Payne asked the three to come into his room.</p>

  <p>Lennie walked to the jade bed in the room and placed Luo Zheng on it.</p>
