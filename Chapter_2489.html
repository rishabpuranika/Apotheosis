<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2489 The Ancient Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Reinhard, Enoch and the other True Gods nodded at Lorena's words.</p>

  <p>Although they had gained nothing from the debate venue, they still survived.</p>

  <p>Notably, Reinhard and the other ten disciples of the Sword Clan survived too. They initially thought they were doomed, but lucky for them, they were given a second chance.</p>

  <p>What was important was that they had accomplished a very difficult task in this journey.</p>

  <p>The members of the Sword Clan, including Reinhard, would certainly be rewarded and put in important positions someday.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess we're leaving now," Reinhard said as he cupped his hands towards Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded with a smile.</p>

  <p>With that, Reinhard led the group and went deep into the mist.</p>

  <p>After they left, Lorena stared at her son and daughter, her black hair twirling behind her.</p>

  <p>As these strands of hair intertwined around Yan and Luo Zheng, the two of them were soon wrapped in Lorena's hair.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you there."</p>

  <p>As soon as Lorena's voice fell, Luo Zheng felt the hair wrap around his body in a strong, hugging motion.</p>

  <p>And just like that, he was lifted from the ground and dragged into the air in a forward motion.</p>

  <p>He noticed that Lorena's beautiful hair emitted a delicate fragrance.</p>

  <p>The scent was very quite strange to Luo Zheng, but he felt a sense of intimacy, which calmed him down nonetheless.</p>

  <p>Maybe this was just the manifestation of their connection in the bloodline.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Sword Divine City, Harold, Gibson and Marsh all looked very pleased to see Lorena carry Luo Zheng and Yan away.</p>

  <p>The area within the Eye of Perception was limited. After Lorena, Luo Zheng and Yan left, they couldn't track them down anymore.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that the umbrella was inside the debate venue, not on the other side of the iron bridge. We were misled." Marsh let out a laugh.</p>

  <p>Gibson nodded in response, saying, "Now that Luo Zheng has got the Sun-resisting Umbrella, shall we move onto our next step, Harold?"</p>

  <p>When they explored the debate venue, their goal was to reach the very end of it. They wanted to cross the iron bridge, but they were never able to succeed.</p>

  <p>With a brief "Hmm," Harold added, "Why don't we wait until Luo Zheng comes out?"</p>

  <p>Although the three of them didn't even participate in the debate, they found themselves more nervous than those who actually competed in it.</p>

  <p>Out of all of them, Harold was the most anxious. When he saw the fiend, Edmond, his mood fell to the bottom.</p>

  <p>He still couldn't figure out any possibility of breaking up the current situation.</p>

  <p>However, there seemed to be an impossible turning point. The sudden appearance of Lorena saved Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>Even if he was as composed as ever, Harold couldn't help but let out a scream.</p>

  <p>It was a miracle.</p>

  <p>At this point, it seemed that Lorena wanted to benefit from the warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Lorena kept flying in the thick mist for five minutes.</p>

  <p>Through the thick hair, Luo Zheng could see the huge chains hanging before him.</p>

  <p>It seemed to be parts of a huge iron bridge.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Lorena crossed the iron bridge and entered a gloomy-looking cave.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng and Yan kept falling, and eventually landed into a deep well.</p>

  <p>"A skeleton!"</p>

  <p>Yan saw a skeleton sitting in the middle of the well, her eyebrows and upper lip quivering in nervousness. She couldn't help but grab Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid," comforted Lorena.</p>

  <p>An odd, hollow laughter came from the skeleton's mouth, and a pair of empty eyes emitted a faint yellow light. He said in a very subtle voice,</p>

  <p>"Little girl, I was like this countless years ago. What I lack is only blood, flesh and skin. There is no difference between us."</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Yan grew even more afraid as she tightly grabbed Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Lorena looked at the skeleton with her right eyebrow up. "Harper," she called out. "Even though you have been cursed with the Blood and Flesh Decaying Curse, you can create a body in a short time, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," the skeleton nodded.</p>

  <p>Then the pale yellow light began to fluctuate around him.</p>

  <p>The energy meridians from his bones were formed, connecting his organs in his ribs once again. Skin began to appear all throughout his body.</p>

  <p>In less than thirty seconds, the skeleton had completely disappeared, replaced by an old man with a face full of wrinkles.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Yan felt much more comfortable with this.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the old man spoke out. "When I first entered here, I had to condense my body's skin every day. However, I have been cursed with the Blood and Flesh Decaying Curse, and my body began to decay. It would be cracked all over and rotten in a stinking smell. Every time it would rot, I'd find a way to condense it again. The pain is unbearable, but I have gone through it millions of times over and over again!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gasped. 'This Blood and Flesh Decaying Curse is so vicious, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"I thought it through later. The skin means nothing to me. Though I'm mostly just bones, I feel better than most people in the world. That's when I stopped condensing the skin for myself," Harper explained, with a calmed look across his face.</p>

  <p>"I...I'm sorry!" Yan thought that her performance might have caused Harper to be a little disturbed.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Harper waved his hand and said, "You don't need to apologize. It's me who should apologize. I don't care about my skin, but I know that it's always impolite to greet people like this."</p>

  <p>"Master Harper, you are a wise man," responded Luo Zheng. "There are countless heroes, but not many people can see this through in the same way you do."</p>

  <p>Staring at Luo Zheng, Harper laughed, turned to Lorena and said, "Lorena, Mike's son is much more easy-going than his father!"</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled upon hearing this. "Harper, have you heard the conversation between Luo Zheng and me in the debate venue?"</p>

  <p>"What did you say? I didn't hear you." Harper shook his head vigorously.</p>

  <p>By the sound of it, it seemed that the bones in his body were too old to withstand such sharp shake. There were very intense cracking sounds when he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to play dumb, Harper?" Lorena was not happy.</p>

  <p>Noticing her expression, Harper said helplessly, "My inheritance is just that Sun-resisting Umbrella! Now that you've got the umbrella, you can leave now. I have a short cut. Do you need me to give you a ride?"</p>

  <p>"Are you seriously unwilling to face up to the reality, Harper?" Lorena stared at Harper and asked.</p>

  <p>After a long while of silence, Harper jolted up and said, "He has the Thousand Sanskrit Land. I'm so jealous! But even so, we still have a slim chance of winning."</p>

  <p>"Old bastard! If you already lost all of your persistence and courage, then what's the use of cultivating your soul to such a state?" she spat in return, voice as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Yan felt rattled as they heard their mother calling names.</p>

  <p>Giving Luo Zheng and Yan a meaningful look, Harper smiled bitterly. "I don't have many treasures with me. Just tell me what you want, Lorena!"</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled, glad that he made a concession as she looked at something behind Harper.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be a long bronze sword inserted there, tucked away very secretively.</p>

  <p>This long sword had existed for countless years. Before this, it had been held in Harper's arms. After he had condensed his skin, he had inserted the sword behind his back.</p>
