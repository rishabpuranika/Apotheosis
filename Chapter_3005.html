<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3005 The Lofty Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Kenelm, Hyde, and eight others were from the Excellence City. It was their first time seeing the Lofty Sword from such a close distance. Naturally, all of them were absolutely thrilled.</p>

  <p>The origin and legend of the Lofty Sword were known far and wide.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and his friends heard about these stories from their families during their childhood.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, the Seven-Star Province was only known as a savage land. It was inhabited by only a few people and most of them were still uncivilized.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Seven-Star Province was still being ruled by Jonas, a powerful unhuman monster. The size of his body was comparable to a huge mountain. His strength greatly exceeded the power of most Other Shore Realm warriors of the human race.</p>

  <p>It was about a million years ago when the Lofty Sword came down from the sky and nailed Jonas down to the Seven-Star Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword belonged to a swordsman named Athemar Qiu. He descended towards the Seven-Star Province and vanquished Jonas. After that, he created the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>For the next million years, the Sword Light Palace continued to reign over the entire Seven-Star Province. It even expanded to some provinces surrounding it. It even had a huge influence on the inhabitants of the barren Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>For this reason, most people from the Gracious Province like Kenelm dreamed about joining the Sword Light Palace someday.</p>

  <p>Zheng started looking around as he sat cross-legged on the platform. The people from the other palaces, however, were all sitting elegantly. His gaze fell softly upon the Lofty Sword not far away from him.</p>

  <p>The main reason why they were observing the Lofty Sword was to understand the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Yet as of this moment, the sword didn't show its sharp aura which was supposed to radiate from it.</p>

  <p>Somehow, it seemed like it had been sealed by an invisible sword sheath.</p>

  <p>"This sword really has a magnificent presence!"</p>

  <p>Being an accomplished swordsman, Zheng was well versed in the art of swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>When Laura brought Zheng and the others into the Seven-Star City, the Lofty Sword had emitted a different kind of aura. It was much more unusual today compared to what they had witnessed before.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword he had been observing for quite a while now had possibly hidden its true aura. However, he knew that it was actually very similar to a dragon diving into the abyss. It could burst forth at any moment too.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was far more frightening now than it had been before.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if anyone in the Sword Light Palace is capable of controlling the Lofty Sword, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The other disciples like Faegan and Jago now appeared quiet and reserved.</p>

  <p>They had a bad reputation and seldom came here to observe the Lofty Sword in the past. They felt somewhat embarrassed at this moment.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, they heard someone speak out from another platform. "Are you serious? How come these pathetic fools from the Sword Dance Palace are here again?"</p>

  <p>"They are all dreadfully worthless. They should not have come here in the first place. Maybe they plotted this together. Are they planning to cause problems here?"</p>

  <p>"I wish the officiant would kick these idiots out of here and disallow them from observing the sword."</p>

  <p>The conversations they heard were from the disciples of the Demon Sword Palace and Burial Sword Palace.</p>

  <p>Some of those disciples were known as prodigies who resided in the Seven-Star City. There were also some who came from the Qiu Clan and Yuebai Clan. But they were from other branches, and they had extraordinary talents. As a result, they were practically unafraid of Faegan and his companions.</p>

  <p>Faegan and his friends had taken a lot of beatings from Zheng these days.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they had fully submitted to his will. Nevertheless, they couldn't just sit idly by and ignore such hateful comments from the other disciples.</p>

  <p>Seething rage took over Faegan. He could not hold his tongue any longer so he shouted, "Freeman Qiu! What you're saying is a load of rubbish!"</p>

  <p>Jago remained stony-faced as he admonished them. "I'm a disciple of the Sword Dance Palace. We are free to come here whenever we want to. Mind your own business."</p>

  <p>Freeman Qiu continued to scorn them and said, "Don't you even dare think that the Sword Dance Palace is worth mentioning alongside the other twelve palaces. Ha-ha! What a ridiculous thought! The Sword Dance Palace only has a group of pathetic and wretched people like you."</p>

  <p>The newest additions to the Sword Dance Palace like Zheng, Kenelm, Hyde, and their friends maintained their composure. They had no idea who these people were after all.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Sword Dance Palace disciples, on the other hand, were not able to stop themselves from reacting. How could they just let the other disciples make fun of their palace? No matter how poor it was, it was the place they could call their own.</p>

  <p>On the spur of the moment, they stood from the platform and glowered at the disciples of the other palaces. In their fury, they seemed like they were about to start a fight.</p>

  <p>At this point, the middle-aged man on the platform got fed up with all the commotion. He yelled, "Didn't I invite all of you here today to observe the sword? Why are you making such a ruckus? Anyone who makes any kind of noise again will be thrown out of here at once!"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was the officiant. He facilitated the observation of the sword. Furthermore, he occupied a high position in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>His voice commanded a certain authority.</p>

  <p>With irksome smiles upon their faces, the disciples of the Burial Sword Palace and Demon Sword Palace appeared satisfied. Meanwhile, Faegan, Jago, and the other disciples of the Sword Dance Palace returned bitterly in their respective seats.</p>

  <p>All they wanted was to observe the sword. They did not expect they would be insulted and made fun of.</p>

  <p>"For now, just focus on reaching the Other Shore Realm. The disciples from the other palaces can ridicule you all they want, but it will not matter. Your best retaliation would be to reach the Other Shore Realm ahead of them someday," Zheng whispered to his companions.</p>

  <p>As soon as they heard this, their faces were filled with cynical looks. "We already attempted so many times before. But no matter how much we tried, we got easily bored with cultivating. We simply couldn't put our minds to it."</p>

  <p>It was not because these disciples lacked skill or expertise. They were prodigies too. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to have become consummate True Gods at such an early age.</p>

  <p>What happened was, as they grew up, they got too preoccupied with distracting thoughts. And the love and care from their doting parents drove their goals and aspirations from their minds.</p>

  <p>It was thanks to the numerous and intense beatings they got from Zheng that they started to change a little.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they were fully aware that their devotion and fervor would only last for a short while.</p>

  <p>When he heard what they said, Zheng looked at Faegan and told him, "Is it really just because cultivating is boring? Personally, I disagree. I think you are just afraid of what will happen if you fail. Are you not? It scares you that people will think of you as someone who has no real talent. If that's the case, then you really are a coward."</p>

  <p>These statements from Zheng temporarily stupefied Faegan, Jago, and others.</p>

  <p>Soon after, these words began to stir something deep in their hearts.</p>

  <p>It was true that they already gave up on themselves in the Sword Dance Palace. At the same time, they were still quite proud of themselves. For instance, Jago was determined to believe that he was not lagging behind Freeman Qiu when it came to talent. Despite this, he refused to even prove himself.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Zheng stated that it wasn't simply because Jago declined to prove himself. In reality, he was merely a coward who didn't have the guts to challenge Freeman Qiu.</p>

  <p>They were perfectly fine being known as playboys who were up to no good.</p>

  <p>But deep within their hearts, they still yearned to prove themselves to their own clans.</p>

  <p>Faegan and his companions were engrossed in their own thoughts.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the officiant told everyone, "Ready yourselves! I am now going to activate the array!"</p>

  <p>Hardly had the officiant finished his words when all the disciples of the thirteen palaces took out the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent translations.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, the officiant sat down in the middle of the platform. His hands made some sort of movement, and orbs of pale cyan light emerged around him.</p>

  <p>Almost simultaneously, the energy around the Lofty Sword changed abruptly.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way that had originally accumulated and formed into a sphere started to bloom. The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent gradually radiated from the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Long and slender streaks of cyan light arose from the surface of the Lofty Sword. They wriggled and surged towards the disciples.</p>

  <p>A streak of cyan light shot towards the space between Zheng's eyebrows. This made him squint a little. Before he could dodge it, the streak of light entered his mind.</p>
