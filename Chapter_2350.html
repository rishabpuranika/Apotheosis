  <p>
</p>

  <p>The strength of Walton's body was nothing to the Time Elk, but a thick current of internal momentum escaped Walton's body, leaving others with an intense feeling of heaviness.</p>

  <p>He was as sturdy as a thick brick wall, able to block the Time Elk all by himself.</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>The Time Elk suddenly burst into a shrill roar.</p>

  <p>It had been at war with these consummate True Gods for a long time, and it was strong enough to defeat any one of them at any time, all by itself.</p>

  <p>It could even devour all these consummate True Gods within several seconds.</p>

  <p>However, the Time Elk was overwhelmed by sheer numbers. The consummate True Gods were like a pack of wolves, and the Time Elk was like a helpless lone bull. No matter what kind of technique it used to attack, the True Gods' combined efforts rendered it useless. Despite the Time Elk's great strength, it was helpless.</p>

  <p>The Time Elk suddenly let out a thundering roar and shook its thick wings, pushing into the ground with its powerful, muscular legs. Then it crashed into Walton.</p>

  <p>Its head down, the Time Elk rushed, and the surrounding space was torn open with huge cracks, resembling a beast's irregular, jagged teeth.</p>

  <p>However, the space in the divine land was not only stable, but also possessed great self-regenerative strength. The small space cracks began to shrink almost as soon as they appeared, and were soon gone.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Come on!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his huge hand, Walton slashed at the air with the purple machete.</p>

  <p>Streaks of yellow ochre power radiated in circles around the purple machete, its power warping and distorting the surrounding space, making it look as if the thing Walton was waving was not a machete, but a mountain.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The two huge forces collided.</p>

  <p>The surrounding space tore violently, and the repeated impact of the conflicting forces continued to ravage it faster than it could repair itself.</p>

  <p>Some of the space cracks were like sharp arrows flying in all directions.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the True Gods had escaped to the other part of the valley.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the black gashes in space, now spreading rapidly, would have cut them to shreds.</p>

  <p>The Earth Divine Dao was not an aggressive Divine Dao. Even though the power of the slash was shocking to any who observed it and extremely powerful, it was still not powerful enough to hurt the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>The Time Elk's head began pushing Walton's machete.</p>

  <p>Even though Walton was connected to the earth, he still couldn't block the Time Elk's advance.</p>

  <p>With the Time Elk advancing towards him, Walton began to retreat. His feet dragged on the ground, creating two deep furrows. Once he had retreated to a distance of several hundred feet, the Time Elk suddenly twisted its body, hitting Walton and sending him flying for a distance of seventy to eighty feet.</p>

  <p>The Time Elk was not unintelligent.</p>

  <p>Back when they were outside the valley, it had already wasted a lot of time on Walton, but he was resilient and remained on his feet, retaining composure and control. On the other hand, when the other consummate True Gods had come in and tried to fight it, their techniques resulted in the Time Elk becoming unstable and chaotic, stimulating it and solving their crisis.</p>

  <p>"Wow, it has become so clever," said the consummate True God of the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>"It's useless. As long as it doesn't go crazy, it won't be much of a threat,"</p>

  <p>Rachelle said as she lightly waved the two weapons in her hands, drawing a beautiful arc in the air. In the blink of an eye, she appeared above the Time Elk, light as a butterfly. Standing on tiptoe atop one of the Time Elk's huge horns, she raised the short sword and shot machete in her hands, and somersaulted backwards, as if she were about to dive.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As she fell, her pure eyes turned bloodshot. Her whole body suddenly turned into what looked like a ribbon of blood, circling around the Time Elk. As she continued whirling around the Time Elk, her sword slashed at it, cutting through its body.</p>

  <p>Anyone who had managed to reach the consummation of True God Realm could not be weak, and had their own unique techniques and signature moves.</p>

  <p>In terms of physical strength, Rachelle might not have been the strongest, but in terms of lethality, she was the most powerful one there, because she was the one who had succeeded in mastering the Murdering Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>And she was the only one who could easily cut the flesh of the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Every flash of sword light left a deep wound in the Time Elk's body, so deep that its bones were visible.</p>

  <p>In what seemed like no time, dozens of wounds had appeared on the Time Elk's body.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, such injuries were not catastrophic to a being as large as the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>As the Time Elk howled, its huge body suddenly became extremely flexible. It twisted and warped itself into a surreal and bizarre shape, its claws continuously slashing at the air. Rachelle, however, was small and nimble as a bird. No matter how much it twisted and grasped at her, it could not catch her.</p>

  <p>She moved elegantly, all the while brandishing her scarlet sword and machete like a butcher. She had already cut through the Time Elk's muscles, and even damaged its bones.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods present in the valley did not plan to take action. Everything was going according to the original plan, and the most crucial factor was Rachelle, as she was the only one who had mastered the Murdering Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The Time Elk's blood vitality was extremely abundant, and its healing ability was extremely strong. Even if a large group of the consummate True Gods succeeded in using powerful means to severely injure it, the Time Elk would heal in an extremely short period of time.</p>

  <p>However, Rachelle's weapons possessed the power of "Blood Breaking".</p>

  <p>If one had observed carefully, one could see that the blood in the wounds of the Time Elk was blackening. This was the power of Blood Breaking in action, the unique power that prevented the Time Elk from healing itself.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Time Elk begin to succumb to its injuries, the True Gods gathering in the west of the valley all breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"The aura of the Time Elk is so frightening, even more horrifying than that of a Holy Being. In the end, it turns out that it is not that powerful after all."</p>

  <p>"If it goes on like this, Rachelle can kill it alone."</p>

  <p>"It's impossible for it to fight back any more."</p>

  <p>These True Gods, who had been ashen-faced with fright just a few moments before, now breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Killing the Time Elk is not that easy," Luo Zheng said as he stared into the distance.</p>

  <p>In the fight against the Time Elk, Rachelle had the upper hand, but the other consummate True Gods were still ready to fight, poised ready for action at any time. The consummate True Gods made great efforts to lead the Time Elk to the first stage, so this matter was not that simple.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng stopped speaking, the Time Elk's eyes suddenly flashed with multicolored light. It raised its head and roared, and its body trembled.</p>

  <p>"That's enough. It is going to activate the Time Backing," a consummate True God warned.</p>

  <p>Reacting fast, Rachelle stopped. She kicked the Time Elk lightly, and floated backwards.</p>

  <p>The Time Elk crawled low across the ground, and a layer of colorful light turned into a huge cocoon, enveloping it.</p>

  <p>"It can use the Time Backing!"</p>

  <p>Only when they had witnessed this did the True Gods finally come to this realization.</p>

  <p>The Time Backing of the Time Elk came from the Timing Divine Dao. It was essentially different from that of the female leader of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>The only thing it could turn back was itself.</p>

  <p>When the Time Elk's injuries were serious, it would use its own talent to perform the Time Backing. It quickly wrapped itself in a thick cocoon and began self-regenerating. The wounds inflicted on its body by Rachelle began disappearing, one after another in rapid succession, and it soon returned to its previous healthy state.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the other consummate True Gods were ready to take action.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Time Elk was able to activate Time Backing only once in a while.</p>

  <p>No matter how severe the injury was, it would be able to recover and go back to normal by performing the Time Backing, but it could not perform it at will. Therefore, they asked Rachelle to force it to activate the Time Backing, and then killed it before it could use it again.</p>

  <p>This was probably the only chance they had to kill the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, all their efforts would continue being rendered futile by its use of the Time Backing technique.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! ...</p>

  <p>After some time, the cocoon encasing the Time Elk began to break into pieces.</p>

  <p>The moment the Time Elk emerged, Troy ordered, "Action!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he had spoken, all the consummate True Gods began to summon the power of the Godly Tiles held within their bodies. For a moment, the power that was emitted by all sorts of internal momentum reverberated around the valley, forming ripples that could be seen by the naked eye.</p>

  <p>When the inferior True Gods felt and saw the ripples, they didn't even dare to breathe, and their souls were suppressed to the extreme.</p>

  <p>"Grand Curse Skill!"</p>

  <p>A dreadful, vibrant green skeleton appeared on the top of the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>After the skeleton appeared, it began shaking over the Time Elk's head.</p>

  <p>The Grand Curse Skill was being employed by the consummate True God of the Liu Clan. When it was cast on the body of the Time Elk, the Time Elk would suffer more damage.</p>

  <p> </p>
