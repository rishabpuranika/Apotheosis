<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Everyone fell into silence when they looked at the graceful strokes of Yan's name carved onto the stone tablet at a height of 920 feet.</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods didn't want to accept the result and planned to try a second or even third time, even though they knew deep in their hearts that Yan's record was unbreakable.</p>

  <p>They looked at Yan's slender and weak figure and couldn't believe that she could have done this.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid no one can climb higher than that," the guy with soybean-like eyes raised his head and declared.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you were great!" Zheng also praised her.</p>

  <p>Yan looked up at the word she had engraved and smiled. "Brother, aren't you going to do it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the group Duke was in, and then shook his head. "There's no hurry."</p>

  <p>Since Yan had occupied the first place, Zheng was not in a hurry to mark his name on the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Moreover, no one from the alliance of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands had tried yet. To make sure that he won, Zheng decided to be the last one to do it.</p>

  <p>"Then let me do it," said the soybean-eyed guy with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his sentence, a cyan cyclone appeared beneath his feet. As the cyclone circled around, his body spun faster and faster, and a spiraled mass of power began to rapidly rise.</p>

  <p>Four more True Gods also began to climb the cyan stone tablet at the same time.</p>

  <p>Duke squinted as he looked at the top of the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but feel irritated when he saw the name "Yan" inscribed on it.</p>

  <p>"Duke, what should we do?" Tyrone asked.</p>

  <p>Tyrone was a warrior of the Mu Clan and had been cultivated by Rachelle.</p>

  <p>He had entered the debate venue for the sole purpose of helping Rachelle take revenge.</p>

  <p>According to Rachelle's instructions, Yan was not important. Regardless of whether Zheng had a chance to obtain the inheritance of the debate venue, his priority was to kill Zheng!</p>

  <p>However, the strength shown by Yan and the disciples of the Sword Clan had made Duke become very cautious.</p>

  <p>That was why he had warned everyone in his party not to act rashly.</p>

  <p>Tyrone had also realized that he might not be able to defeat Yan, so he was controlling himself with all his might.</p>

  <p>Now that the inheritance of the debate venue had been found and Yan was about to get it, he became anxious.</p>

  <p>"Help me," said Duke, staring at the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>"How can I help you?" Tyrone was confused. "Do you want us to fight together?"</p>

  <p>"Fight? No." Duke shook his head. "Help me beat Yan's record!"</p>

  <p>The truth was, he was very conflicted.</p>

  <p>He had clearly seen the shadow of the fiend named Edmond in the mist.</p>

  <p>He was sure that he must be in the debate venue, but he hadn't seen him again along the way.</p>

  <p>Now, everyone was trying to mark their names on the cyan stone tablet, but the fiend still hadn't appeared.</p>

  <p>'Zheng and Yan getting the inheritance?</p>

  <p>Not on my watch, ' Duke thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He had found himself in an unexpected situation. Under these circumstances, he could only fight against it with his own ability.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of his hand, seven Phoenix-head Golden Needles appeared on his palm, and a Dragon-head Silver Needle appeared on his other palm.</p>

  <p>"Energy-extracting Needles!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the needles in Duke's hands, Tyrone frowned.</p>

  <p>"This is the only way," Duke said through life vitality.</p>

  <p>The other members of the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands all pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>Energy-extracting Needles were unique secret weapons of the Dongfang Clan. Using a Phoenix-head Golden Needle, a warrior could draw out another warrior's energy and use it as their own.</p>

  <p>But the process would have a great impact on the elixir field, inner world, and Godly Tile of the warrior whose energy was extracted.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan members only used this method when they absolutely had to.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's necessary yet," Tyrone said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Duke, maybe you can surpass Yan?" agreed Ellis.</p>

  <p>No one wanted to be pricked by those needles.</p>

  <p>Duke shook his head. "Don't you all see? Zheng hasn't made a move yet."</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>"The guy is not even a top-rank True God. He can't even fly. It's impossible for him to mark his name on the cyan stone tablet, right?"</p>

  <p>"I think so too. Duke, if you surpass Yan, you'll win!"</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Duke smiled bitterly. "It's not that easy to surpass 920 feet. Besides, I think Zheng hasn't made a move yet because he is confident that he can jump higher than Yan."</p>

  <p>Seeing that the others didn't believe him, he had no choice but to continue. "If you really want me to break through the height of 920 feet, you'd better use the Energy-extracting Needles. If I get the inheritance, you'll all enjoy better treatment in your clans!"</p>

  <p>A look of interest suddenly appeared on all their faces.</p>

  <p>Duke was right; if they really obtained the inheritance of the debate venue, they would be able to establish their status within their clans.</p>

  <p>It was worth opening themselves up to the damage of the Energy-extracting Needles.</p>

  <p>Duke seized the opportunity and sent the seven Phoenix-head Golden Needles toward the seven True Gods.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he pointed the Dragon-head Silver Needle toward his chest and patted it slightly. In an instant, the needle pierced through his chest, leaving behind only a small and exquisite dragon head.</p>

  <p>Tyrone gazed at the Phoenix-head Golden Needle in front of him for a while before making up his mind.</p>

  <p>With a deep breath, he let the Phoenix-head Golden Needle pierce into his chest.</p>

  <p>The others were also hesitating, but when they saw what Tyrone did, they put their worries behind.</p>

  <p>The moment they stabbed the Phoenix-head Golden Needle into their chest, a small whirlpool began spinning in each of their bodies, constantly devouring their blood and energy, and even the life vitality and momentum in the inner world of their body.</p>

  <p>At the same time, there was a reverse whirlpool in Duke's chest.</p>

  <p>As strength flowed into his body, he felt as if his body was being inflated.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for the seven Phoenix-head Golden Needles to transfer all of the energy of the seven True Gods to Duke. But his power doubled in a short time after his energy was combined with the seven top-rank True Gods' energies.</p>

  <p>By this time, the soybean-eyed guy had already reached the top of the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>"850 feet!"</p>

  <p>"That guy isn't from a Floating Island either. I didn't expect him to be so powerful!"</p>

  <p>"Although he is not as strong as Yan, he is ranked the second..."</p>

  <p>The soybean-eyed guy stopped and wrote "Jay" on the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>The others didn't care much about the word, but Zheng's eyelids twitched when he saw it.</p>

  <p>'Did Holy Jay send him?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>When he had been in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, he had heard that Holy Jay was looking for a True God who could save the divine land. Obviously, in the eyes of Holy Jay, Zheng was only one of the candidates.</p>

  <p>For some reason, Zheng couldn't shake off his suspicions.</p>

  <p>When the engraving was done, the soybean-eyed guy descended to the ground with a sour face. He was not satisfied with the height the word was at.</p>

  <p>Then he turned his head and looked at Zheng. "Zheng, we look to you now."</p>
