<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I'll get you out of this inner world right now,"</p>

  <p>Brianna said and lightly waved her hand towards Luo Luo Zheng. The next moment, he felt an invisible force enveloping him.</p>

  <p>Soon after that, his soul suddenly shot straight up into the sky. As he was flying in the air, he was struck by another bolt of lightning that startled him.</p>

  <p>After leaving the inner world, Luo Luo Zheng returned once again into Brianna's mind. As he was getting aware of his surroundings, he heard the woman's voice.</p>

  <p>"I've sealed off all the power you released from the Soul Core earlier.</p>

  <p>But there shouldn't be any problem now."</p>

  <p>Following this piece of information, strands of grey light began to soak into Brianna's body. Luo Zheng's soul was immersed in her mind now, and her bodily senses were slowly wakening.</p>

  <p>Unaware of these developments, Turner, War King Wind, and the rest of the company were standing around with gloomy expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was extremely depressing on the platform, and it was visible on everyone's face.</p>

  <p>The longer they waited, the slimmer their hopes became. It had already been four hours since the unfortunate incident, but there was still no news of Luo Luo Zheng, nor any communication from him.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Luo Zheng's soul had probably perished long ago. It was just that they were still in denial and didn't want to admit it.</p>

  <p>"Alas, we shouldn't have explored the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land this time. It would have been completely fine if we didn't try to get our hands on the Ancestral Dragon's egg. What really gets to me is that we brought Tianxing with us. And now he's gone..." a Soul Sea Realm master suddenly remarked. Regret could be seen on his face.</p>

  <p>"Give up on the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land? Humph! I don't think Master Derek would have been too happy with that idea!" another Soul Sea Realm master refuted.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Although the Ancestral Dragon's egg is important, I believe Tianxing is more important than that. Furthermore, I am unsure that we will obtain the Ancestral Dragon's egg this year anyway. So I guess we will have to try next year."</p>

  <p>"Guys, the problem is that Tianxing himself insisted on entering the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land! So it's not actually our fault, and we can't blame it on him either."</p>

  <p>Numerous powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm began animatedly discussing the matter.</p>

  <p>"Quiet!"</p>

  <p>War King Wind suddenly stood up and roared at them furiously.</p>

  <p>Although every single warrior on the platform was at the Soul Sea Realm, the authority of any one of the four emperors was unquestionable. Thus, when War King Wind roared, everyone shut their mouths.</p>

  <p>"I will take over a corpse on the 12th floor. And then we'll head towards the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land!" War King Wind continued. He was already in a terrible mood to begin with after seeing what happened to Luo Luo Zheng, so when he heard them make a ruckus, he naturally became extremely agitated.</p>

  <p>Hearing that her father wanted to leave, Fiona stopped him. "Father, why don't we wait a little longer?"</p>

  <p>Even though Fiona's soul was currently in another woman's body, War King Wind could still read the sorrow in her eyes. "Look. Tianxing is probably dead."</p>

  <p>Although no one knew what was going on inside the woman's body, the death of a Soul Sea Realm master could easily explain everything. The master's soul was still inside the corpse when he had approached the woman's body, but the corpse had been burned and the master's soul was eliminated in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>This woman was extremely powerful. The corpse belonged to the Dragon Lineage Human, but it was still burnt to a crisp just by the power of her eyes.</p>

  <p>Fiona pursed her lips, and a trace of stubbornness appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>She replied, "Father, I want to investigate a bit more!"</p>

  <p>"No way!" War King Wind refused Fiona's request without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The miserable state of that Soul Sea Realm master was still fresh in his mind, and he wasn't going to let his daughter fall prey to the same fate.</p>

  <p>"Fiona, give up." Callan also shook his head at his sister.</p>

  <p>Fiona didn't say anything. She only looked at the nearby stone pillar, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>Right now, only Turner, War King Wind, and War Emperor York were still in their soul forms. After the woman's crystal coffin had been opened, the resultant events had made them afraid that more accidents might follow, so they had entered the 12th floor.</p>

  <p>Soon after that, War King Wind and the other two emperors had picked up corpses on the 12th floor and returned to the 13th floor.</p>

  <p>"All right! Let's go!" War King Wind ordered.</p>

  <p>Although everyone felt helpless, there was really nothing they could do.</p>

  <p>They could only choose to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. The emperor could not be questioned.</p>

  <p>The road to the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land lay at the back of the cemetery. They just needed to go down the stairs on the other side.</p>

  <p>However, just as everyone was about to go around the stone pillar and leave, Fiona suddenly started walking towards the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>"Fiona!" Callan shouted loudly.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were also alarmed by Fiona's action. They moved back a couple of steps.</p>

  <p>At the same time, War King Wind shot towards Fiona like an arrow.</p>

  <p>'Alas! Fiona has always been an obedient child, but now, she is going to do something against my orders. For a man. Even if Tianxing is not dead, she will be killed as soon as she gets close to that woman! I must stop her!' he thought.</p>

  <p>Fiona felt regret in her heart. She felt that it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to die here just like that. As for the mystery surrounding this woman, she really wanted to look into it.</p>

  <p>"Fiona! Stop right there!" War King Wind roared.</p>

  <p>Fiona merely turned a deaf ear to the angry roar of her father. She stood in front of the woman and asked calmly, "What did you do to Tianxing?"</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, War King Wind cursed harshly inside his mind. He was furious at the fact that his daughter could be so naive. Luckily, the woman did not open her eyes. He hoped that she would let Fiona go.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, War King Wind was only about 20 to 30 feet away from Fiona. As for the other Soul Sea Realm masters, they had also returned and were following behind him.</p>

  <p>While these events were taking place, the grey light from the Soul Core had already enveloped all parts of Brianna's body.</p>

  <p>"There is a girl standing in front of me who isn't afraid of death. She dares to come close. Is she your sweetheart?" Brianna asked Luo Luo Zheng in her mind.</p>

  <p>Of all the warriors present, only Fiona was a female. Luo Luo Zheng understood Brianna's reference and replied, "Don't hurt her!"</p>

  <p>Brianna smiled but didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had now completed his assimilation. The control of the body was temporarily in his hands. He tried moving his fingers a few times, and then slowly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>When the golden pupils in the woman's eyes appeared, War King Wind revealed a look of shock. He increased his speed even further, adamant on getting Fiona out of the danger zone.</p>

  <p>However, Fiona sternly said, "Master, please tell me how Tianxing is doing.</p>

  <p>We are here just? "</p>

  <p>Before she could finish her words, a figure rushed over and pulled her away from the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>"Go! All of you! Run! She is waking up once again!"</p>

  <p>"We need to get out of here and make it into the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land!"</p>

  <p>After all, this woman was at the Spirit Supreme Realm. There was not a warrior in this company that could stand in front of her and not be crushed. No one wanted to face her.</p>

  <p>Fiona was being dragged down by her father, and was forced to run down the stairs at the other side while the other Soul Sea Realm masters were now rushing forward as well.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes and saw this scene, his face was filled with bewilderment. Why did they abandon him and run away? With a quick thought, Luo Luo Zheng understood this point.</p>

  <p>Brianna had just killed a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. Now he was controlling her body, but they didn't know who was pulling the strings. It would have been more strange if they didn't run away. They didn't know it was him.</p>

  <p>Since he was not familiar with the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, he had to enter it with the people from the four divine kingdoms. As he thought of this, Luo Luo Zheng quickly grabbed the space ring that he had placed aside and took out the Black Star. He gently waved it and shattered the chains on the woman's legs.</p>

  <p>Then, he leaped down from the pillar.</p>

  <p>'Wow! This body is awesome. A Spirit Supreme Realm warrior is indeed quite amazing.' Luo Luo Zheng could feel that the woman body was filled with power.</p>

  <p>His own strength was not weaker than a Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>But if he didn't use the power of the dragon scales, he would be weaker than a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped on the floor, he immediately felt that his chest was sinking. At the same time, a strange expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>The structures of a woman's and a man's bodies are quite different, and being in the former one felt quite strange.</p>

  <p>However, right now, Luo Luo Zheng could not care any less about that. He quickly steadied himself, his feet lightly stepped on the floor and his entire body shot out like an arrow, closely following behind Turner and the rest.</p>

  <p>"We're safe now, guys. That woman's legs are still bound by the chains!"</p>

  <p>"Hmm, there's no need to run then."</p>

  <p>"It was really dangerous just now though. Where did this woman come from? I thought Spirit Supreme Realm warriors would be driven away from this great world. Why is she here after all this time?"</p>

  <p>Just as the warriors of the four divine kingdoms relaxed, a Soul Sea Realm master looked back and saw the woman diving down at an extremely fast speed. His face darkened and he shouted out, "Run! She's still after us!"</p>
