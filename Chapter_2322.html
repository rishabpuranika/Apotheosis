<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"We have already begun to be rewarded with the divine might coins after only having killed the second wave of beasts." Reginald sighed as he shook his head slightly.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with this forbidden land, anyway?" asked another top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>It was common for warriors to obtain divine might coins after they killed the beasts in the valley. Certain warriors had even received the supreme treasure of belief.</p>

  <p>The rewards were usually distributed when the seventh or eighth wave of beasts had been attacked though, and only a few divine might coins appeared. In all, the number was far less than that of the divine might coins they could obtain now.</p>

  <p>Everyone understood the rules of the forbidden land from the past, which meant that the more the rewards were, the higher the difficulty was, and the greater the risk would be.</p>

  <p>"Well, if we can collect good rewards here, then maybe we don't have to go to the second stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land. We can just give it up later." Reginald shrugged his shoulders and a fierce fighting intent burst out from his body.</p>

  <p>Reginald equally had a tattoo on his shoulder. It was a large and magnificent blue lion head.</p>

  <p>As his fighting intent grew more and more intense, the lion head quietly revealed itself with a vivid, life-like look and emitted a blue light.</p>

  <p>"Hooo..." A low hum was heard from the crowd.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation, Reginald had rushed into the mass of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions.</p>

  <p>The needles of the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were indeed very powerful, but the True Gods were usually only attacked when they were caught off guard.</p>

  <p>The True Gods present maintained an extremely high vigilance. With their high speed, it wasn't difficult for them to dodge the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions. As for the top-rank True Gods, on the other hand, such as Reginald, they looked like they were entering an empty, dark place. They rampaged wildly among the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions.</p>

  <p>Despite the poisonous needles shooting toward Reginald, he didn't even bother dodging them. Before they got anywhere close to him, they were instantly shattered thanks to the fighting intent attached to his body's surface.</p>

  <p>One Poisonous Wolf Scorpion's death meant one divine might coin.</p>

  <p>Faced with thousands of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions spewing at them endlessly, the True Gods all went crazy.</p>

  <p>The True Gods ignored how powerful the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were, and they hurried forward in order to attack them. Using their fiercest methods for killing the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, the True Gods were quick to grab the divine might coins off the ground and put them in their space rings!</p>

  <p>Every time they attacked and killed the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, they obtained as many divine might coins as they would get in other small lands over the course of several years. No one was willing to pass on such an opportunity.</p>

  <p>When it came to Luo Zheng's speed for killing the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, he wasn't slow at all. He was the first one to take action and thus to obtain the decisive opportunity. He killed the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions and rushed off into the distance.</p>

  <p>The Poisonous Wolf Scorpions wrapped themselves up around him like a torrent of blood, shooting poisonous needles directly at him.</p>

  <p>Clearly though, he didn't care about the poisonous needles in the least. A watermelon-sized thunder ball materialized out of nowhere in his hand, and five small thunder balls could be seen in the center of it. The small thunder balls collided with each other and piercing sounds rang out, giving the impression they were going to explode at any second.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the watermelon-sized thunder ball and threw it heavily onto the ground!</p>

  <p>THUD!</p>

  <p>A round flash of lightning crackled beneath his feet. Within a radius of several hundred feet, all the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were struck by the bolt. Their bright red shells were instantly charred before turning into a pile of black powder.</p>

  <p>Flip-flop... Flip-flop...</p>

  <p>Hundreds and thousands of divine might coins appeared on the ground in front of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng casually waved his hand in the air, and a wisp of cyan wind blew. In a brief instant, all the divine might coins were rolled up by the wind.</p>

  <p>Once they were hovering no more than two feet above the ground, the coins quickly circled around Luo Zheng and finally entered his space ring.</p>

  <p>"Twelve thousand divine might coins," Luo Zheng said, with a smile curling at the corners of his mouth. He flew up and precipitated toward the next pack of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Zheng, Reginald, and other top-rank True Gods dared to play in such a way, especially in this valley.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True Gods, such as Pascal and Langston, might have had such an ability, but they didn't have the needed confidence in avoiding all the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions' needles. For this reason, they helplessly turned their backs to the Goddess Statue while attacking the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, which naturally reduced their speed.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng jumped up and once again landed directly in the middle of a group of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions. This time, his stomp also shattered hundreds of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions around him. Using the same method as earlier, he created another thunder ball in his hand, slamming it with all his might onto the ground!</p>

  <p>The Poisonous Wolf Scorpions disappeared in front of him once again, leaving nothing behind but divine might coins for him to collect.</p>

  <p>However, this time, before Luo Zheng had the chance to bring these divine might coins into his space ring, a sturdy True God suddenly pressed forward and shouted coldly, "Get away!" Moments later, a layer of yellow internal momentum appeared on his fist, which was unbelievably solid. He suddenly thrust his fist toward the ground.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The ground around him began to tremble instantly, and simultaneously, the divine might coins started flowing along the ground toward the mid-rank True God. Then, with a simple wave of his hand, the divine might coins were sucked into his space ring.</p>

  <p>The series of actions played out extremely fast, so much so that Luo Zheng barely had the chance to react. Once the mid-rank True God had finished taking away all the divine might coins, he even tilted his head and glanced at Luo Zheng indifferently. "I'm the one who was supposed to kill these Poisonous Wolf Scorpions. You just grabbed at the chance first. I won't blame you for that. Get out of here! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced back at the mid-rank True God carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Have I failed to convince you? You brat!" the True God spat. He glared straight into Luo Zheng's eyes with a cold expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had demonstrated nothing but extraordinary strength in the Divine Time Temple, he was still nobody in this mid-rank True God's opinion. It was obvious that he didn't take Luo Zheng, a low-rank True God, seriously.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Reginald and the others were watching the scene frowning, but none of them dared interfere.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and a faint killing intent flashed across them.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he turned his head and jumped up, once again rushing into another group of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The enormous thunder ball spread out, and a huge group of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions turned into carbon powder.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng didn't expect though, was that the mid-rank True God would come over to him again. He punched the ground, and the ground trembled again. Once more, the True God took the divine might coins away. It was then that he smugly said, "I forgot to remind you that the divine might coins here also belong to me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored the mid-rank True God and continued to press his way into the other groups of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions in order to kill them using the Thunderstorm Divine Dao. In fact, he even stopped trying to scoop up the divine might coins, and simply moved on to his next target. This mid-rank True God continued to follow him and accumulate all the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>At the start of this all, everyone had been anxious to kill the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions and therefore, no one had noticed these two warriors' strange movements.</p>

  <p>As the number of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions decreased, more and more people began to take notice of this odd scene.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing has killed plenty of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, but it seems that all the divine might coins have been taken away by Nathaniel!"</p>

  <p>"The guy is even capable of bearing Nathaniel's unreasonable behavior.</p>

  <p>I'm impressed," a warrior said frankly.</p>

  <p>"If not that, then what else was he supposed to do? If he dares resist, Nathaniel will kill him effortlessly. There's no question about that."</p>

  <p>The True Gods whispered amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>Nathaniel Dongfang was considered the Dongfang Clan's talent.</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends, Nathaniel Dongfang had battled against those who had a higher cultivation base than him. Having won seven consecutive battles and lost only one, he'd obtained 1.3 million points!</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the anonymous man's appearance, then he would have easily been considered the warrior of excellence throughout the competition this time around.</p>

  <p>Nelly stood with her hands clasped behind her back, staring at Luo Zheng with her vigorous eyes. She wanted to see how Luo Zheng was going to deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, Aleyna and Kelsey were worried and upset. They couldn't help Luo Zheng this time. Nathaniel Dongfang was from the Dongfang Clan which was very powerful, and the Han Clan didn't dare offend this clan's members. Besides, Nathaniel Dongfang's strength was unfathomable. No one was a match to him.</p>

  <p>Liusu frowned and stared at Luo Zheng. Although she pretended to feel indifferently about the situation, she paid close attention to him the entire time. She knew Luo Zheng's character well. If Nathaniel Dongfang forced him hard enough, Luo Zheng would surely make his move. But Luo Zheng was just a low-rank True God, so how could he be of any benefit to the mid-rank True God?</p>

  <p>As Langston watched the scene, he felt overjoyed. He already had the intention to kill Luo Zheng, but he hadn't found the proper time to do so. Now though, this temporarily gathered group was under Reginald's lead. Luo Zheng had saved Reginald's life, and if Langston took action to kill Luo Zheng, Reginald would definitely prevent him.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Nathaniel Dongfang appeared and bullied Luo Zheng. In this type of situation, it was possible that Luo Zheng would ultimately suffer greatly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to move toward the other group of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, as though he hadn't seen what Nathaniel Dongfang was doing. After killing yet another group of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, Nathaniel Dongfang took all the divine might coins away again.</p>

  <p>Most of the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions throughout the entire valley had been killed, and only a small number of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were slowly crawling toward the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>A look of satisfaction suddenly appeared on Nathaniel Dongfang's face.</p>

  <p>As he turned around with the intention of returning to the Goddess Statue, someone spoke flatly behind him, "Are you going to leave, just like that?"</p>
