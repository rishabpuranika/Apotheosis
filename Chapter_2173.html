<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every name on that list was a matter of great concern.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, it was that mysterious young man who had the highest level of attention.</p>

  <p>No one noticed Luo Zheng when he appeared at the gate of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>But once he was discovered and identified, word spread quickly.</p>

  <p>Soon after, in the vast yard of the Heavenly Han House, everyone knew that the proving godly warrior clad in plain clothes was the young man who had defeated Eric in a single move.</p>

  <p>Eric's eyes shot through the crowd and landed right on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His eyes were like two awls that pierced straight through Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, before Eric could even react, he was already defeated by Luo Zheng. After Luo Zheng hit him, Eric was rendered unconscious. Later, he woke up to the dreadful fact that he had been defeated in a single move.</p>

  <p>Five thousand divine might coins were by no means a small amount of money, but to Eric, it was nothing.</p>

  <p>Recently, everyone had been talking about that young man. As Luo Zheng had not left his name behind, people referred to him as "the one who defeated Eric in a single move." Eric had become a mere stepping stone for Luo Zheng, much to his shame.</p>

  <p>Because of Zheng's sensitivity, he immediately felt Eric's hostility.</p>

  <p>Apart from him, there were others in the crowd who didn't seem too friendly.</p>

  <p>A faint smile still hung on Zheng's face as he walked through the crowd, not caring in the slightest.</p>

  <p>After confirming Eric's strength, Luo Zheng had a complete understanding of the strength these proving godly warriors had.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, when ordinary talents became world lords, they grew even stronger than these proving godly warriors. The proving godly warriors were no match for top-ranked ace talents or Godly Geniuses. Luo Zheng had no interest in dealing with these proving godly warriors, but to him, entering the Heavenly Han House was mandatory.</p>

  <p>Wherever Luo Zheng passed by, the surrounding proving godly warriors gave way for him.</p>

  <p>Some were envious of him and some believed he was a nobody— he must have been lucky enough to be able to be on par with the elite warriors of big clans.</p>

  <p>Still, there were those who felt that Luo Zheng wouldn't be happy for long. If someone targeted Luo Zheng in the exam of the Heavenly Han House, he could very well be eliminated.</p>

  <p>News of the mysterious young man who defeated Eric in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant had also reached Master Wu. Despite being a True God, he was also very curious about this powerful man blessed with luck. Hearing the commotion, he pushed his way through the crowd.</p>

  <p>When his eyes landed on Luo Zheng, he was stunned. He had been looking for Luo Zheng just then, but who would've thought that Luo Zheng would appear right away? When Master Wu noticed the surrounding warriors, he finally realized that the mysterious young man ranking fourth on the list was actually Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>After he understood this point, Master Wu was stunned.</p>

  <p>The first time Luo Zheng appeared in front of the Heavenly Han House, Master Wu treated him as a mere martial artist. Even though Luo Zheng had guided him, Master Wu thought that it was all due to luck. Luo Zheng had heard of his method from others, after all— his own strength wasn't worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>Finally, Master Wu understood why Luo Zheng didn't mind receiving a White Jade Token only— Luo Zheng had the strength and confidence to pass the exam of the Heavenly Han House, so a White Jade Token allowing him to participate in the exam was enough for him. Master Wu had been afraid that Luo Zheng might want to be enrolled in the Heavenly Han House straight away, but he was mistaken.</p>

  <p>Finding an empty corner, Luo Zheng leaned against the wall. To drown out the noisy environment, he closed his eyes and waited quietly for the examination to begin.</p>

  <p>Though he didn't want to cause anyone any trouble, there were some warriors trying to cause trouble for him.</p>

  <p>On a high platform at the side of the yard, the Han Clan's five elite disciples stared at Luo Zheng with different expressions— Zane's eyes were as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng stand still, Zane announced, "I'll go meet this guy!"</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to make a move, Seth reached out a hand to warn him. "Don't make a move in the Heavenly Han House."</p>

  <p>The Han Clan was the rule-maker of the Six-Burden Divine City— it had the Thousand Commandments Slate under its control. For their own benefit, they knew ways to evade the rules of the slate. But it was the examination day of the Heavenly Han House. If Zane were to make a move in front of such a large crowd, he'd end up causing way too much trouble.</p>

  <p>"I know what to do," Zane said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Jumping off the platform, he walked towards Luo Zheng. The proving godly warriors along the way saw Zane approaching and gave way. In the Six-Burden Divine City, no one dared to provoke a member of the Han Clan because the territory was theirs— they had an unchecked power to kill.</p>

  <p>When Zane walked up to Luo Zheng, he saw that Zheng's eyes were still tightly shut. He frowned and coldly said, "Those who participate in the examination of the Heavenly Han House must register their names and origins. Who are you and where are you from?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zane's tone, all the proving godly warriors got excited. The exam hadn't even started yet and a show was already unfolding.</p>

  <p>They all wondered how that mysterious young man would deal with Zane.</p>

  <p>Slowly opening his eyes, Luo Zheng glanced at Zane faintly before closing them again as if he had chosen not to hear his question.</p>

  <p>"You'd better answer me. If you don't, I'll expel you from the Heavenly Han House." Feeling overlooked, Zane's tone grew angrier just as his blood started boiling.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng smiled and asked, "Are you an examiner of the Heavenly Han House?"</p>

  <p>Zane hadn't expected Luo Zheng to ask such a question. After a pause, he replied, "I'm not an examiner, so what?"</p>

  <p>"Since you're also here to take the exam, what right do you have to question me?" Luo Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Zane thought about it, the corners of his mouth curling up as his expression turned proud. "Because Han is my last name. I represent the examiners of the Heavenly Han House."</p>

  <p>In the city, the Han Clan members didn't have a need for reason— they were unchallenged.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng opened his eyes and looked at Zane mischievously. "If a Han Clan member can represent the examiners of the Heavenly Han House, is there a need for us to take the exam? Wouldn't it be just as well if the Heavenly Han House directly enrolls your Han Clan members? Why bother enrolling the warriors from the thirty-six regions? Are you putting on some kind of act?</p>

  <p>Everyone, don't you think so?" Luo Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>All the proving godly warriors present were holding onto a sliver of hope that they could prove the Godly Way. They had used all sorts of methods to obtain a spot in the test and participate in the exam.</p>

  <p>However, Zane's words were completely unreasonable. He himself was here to participate in the test, so the Heavenly Han House should at least guarantee the fairness of the test.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the whole exam was a joke.</p>

  <p>Although the chances of these warriors being admitted into the Heavenly Han House were low, it didn't stop them from pursuing it. Fairness was a must.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng quieted down, the rest of the warriors began chattering among themselves.</p>

  <p>"That's right. If Zane thinks he's an examiner, then he can just announce that he has passed the exam and joined the Heavenly Han House. Why does he still need to act for everyone to see?"</p>

  <p>"We came all the way here just to be toyed with?"</p>

  <p>"Every year, half the slots are taken up by the disciples of Han Clan. Just enroll them and stop with the act!"</p>

  <p>Before long, the faint discussions grew into a wave of booing.</p>

  <p>Some even began making a ruckus.</p>

  <p>"It seems there's no need for an exam this year. Just let the Heavenly Han House decide on who can enter."</p>

  <p>"I thought one's comprehension and strength were what mattered, but I was wrong. The Han Clan has the final say.</p>

  <p>We might as well just leave now."</p>

  <p>Of course, the warriors weren't intending to leave. They were just relieved to have someone take the lead in venting their anger.</p>

  <p>The playfulness in Zheng's eyes grew more apparent the longer he stared at Zane. He was deliberately guiding the emotions of these proving godly warriors to say such words. But he didn't think the result would be so satisfying.</p>

  <p>The booing grew louder and louder, spreading back and forth like a tidal wave through the courtyard.</p>

  <p>It was something completely new to Zane, leaving him in a panic.</p>

  <p>Although he could represent the Han Clan, its rules still stood. If he caused unnecessary trouble, he would be severely punished.</p>
