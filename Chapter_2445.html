<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2445 An Avatar Of The First Class </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The light began to condense and quickly transformed into a dark shadow.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng watched, his curiosity grew. He wanted to know who he trusted most.</p>

  <p>He hadn't been with Yan for a long time, and he was not the most powerful being in her opinion.</p>

  <p>However, Yan subconsciously trusted Luo Zheng the most so her avatar had taken his form.</p>

  <p>So, who would be the person he trusted the most? Who would the shadow transform into?</p>

  <p>As the light continued to condense, it finally turned into a slender, tall red figure.</p>

  <p>It stood before Luo Zheng with a long spear in its hand.</p>

  <p>When he was able to see the figure clearly, he was stunned. How could it be Xun?</p>

  <p>The red avatar shone with a blazing light, and it looked like bright blood spilled over its body. Once it had taken its full shape, it outshone the others.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, isn't this your sword spirit?"</p>

  <p>Yan craned her neck to study the tall and slender girl.</p>

  <p>The last time Luo Zheng had been with Yan, they were in the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>But then she had been taken away by Harold, and he hadn't seen her since.</p>

  <p>At that time, Xun had woken up, and had become his powerful support, but he didn't summon her in the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Because of that, Yan had always thought that Xun was just Luo Zheng's sword spirit. She'd never considered that Xun was the queen of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself did not expect that Xun was the person he trusted the most. He had expected it to be his father.</p>

  <p>He thought carefully for a moment. Realization dawned on him as he remembered that his father had only appeared twice when he was in dire need of him.</p>

  <p>Once his father helped him resist the Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation, and the other time was when he fought against the energy soul of Murphy.</p>

  <p>However, when he was in the Lower World, Xun had accompanied him on many perilous escapades.</p>

  <p>All the way from the Tower of Sin to the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>Now that he really thought about it, Xun was indeed one of the people he had relied on the most during that time.</p>

  <p>The strange look in Yan's eyes became more prominent. "Luo Zheng, why do you trust your sword spirit so much?"</p>

  <p>She tilted her head and looked at Xun with a curious expression.</p>

  <p>"It's a long story. She belongs to a special race. She was not a pure sword spirit. When I have time in the future, I will tell you what happened," said Luo Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>While the two of them were discussing Xun's appearance, everyone around them stared at Luo Zheng's avatar with a dull expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was among them.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is his avatar?"</p>

  <p>"Why is it so much more solid than ours?"</p>

  <p>"It's almost completely different from all of ours."</p>

  <p>Many of them were murmuring questions under their breaths, each one mirroring questions Reinhard was only thinking. The deeper their understanding of the Truths of Divine Dao, the more powerful the avatars formed in the array.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had a detailed study of the array textures here.</p>

  <p>Powerful avatars didn't have much to do with the type of Truth of Divine Dao that the True Gods cultivated, because the avatars were not created by the True Gods themselves. The avatars were actually created by the array textures.</p>

  <p>The array textures would perceive the extent to which the True Gods had comprehended the Truth of Divine Dao and give them avatars accordingly.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had even ranked the strength of the avatars into different classes.</p>

  <p>There were four classes in total, and each class was then further divided into three levels.</p>

  <p>Long ago, a handful of Holy Beings had broken into the debate venue.</p>

  <p>After entering, they had also been overcome with fear.</p>

  <p>They were strong, but their fear was much stronger. Marsh had been killed by the vicious monster that had formed in response to his fear.</p>

  <p>Since then, the Holy Beings had become more careful, and began to search for the mystery inside the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Their search led them to the discovery of unimpressive array textures on the ground. But when they had begun to study them, avatars had started to form.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, their comprehension of the Truths of Divine Dao at that time was far beyond that of these top-rank True Gods now gathered.</p>

  <p>The avatar that Marsh had summoned was the most powerful. It was the top level of the second class.</p>

  <p>"Reinhard, that man..." someone started to say, but was interrupted.</p>

  <p>"What are the classes of the avatars summoned by Luo Zheng and his sister?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's avatar seems to be more powerful than his sister's. What's the class of his avatar?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say that the core object of our protection is Yan?"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan whispered their questions to Reinhard, at a loss for what to do.</p>

  <p>Reinhard stared at Yan's avatar and then at Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>His sharp eyes reflected his puzzled feelings.</p>

  <p>He did not care about the images of the avatars. The strength of the avatars had nothing to do with their images after all.</p>

  <p>The moment Yan summoned her avatar, Reinhard had been ecstatic.</p>

  <p>The girl that Harold brought was truly extraordinary. Yan's avatar was in the low level of the second class.</p>

  <p>This meant that Yan was able to comprehend more than fifty percent of a certain Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>As far as Reinhard knew, only the avatars summoned by the Holy Beings fell into the second class.</p>

  <p>The avatars summoned by the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan were all in the second class. Marsh's avatar was in the top level, and the others were in the low level.</p>

  <p>However, the consummate True Gods and the Holy Beings were not welcome in the debate venue. Even if they had powerful avatars, it would still be difficult for them to enter deep into the debate venue. If they were lucky enough to defeat the incarnations of their fears, there would still be even more powerful restrictions to face.</p>

  <p>So one could imagine how shocked Reinhard was when he saw the avatar Yan had summoned.</p>

  <p>He had once thought that this debate would be the last one in history. After all, as long as the chosen one got the inheritance of that skeleton, there would be no need to hold the debate again.</p>

  <p>Reinhard firmly believed the chosen one should be Yan.</p>

  <p>But now he wasn't sure. He would have never imagined that the avatar Luo Zheng could summon would be stronger than Yan's.</p>

  <p>It still boggled his mind.</p>

  <p>"That avatar of Luo Zheng's is at least in the middle level of the first class. It may even be at the top level of the first class!" Reinhard relayed the information to the members of the Sword Clan using life vitality.</p>

  <p>Solomon and the others were standing to the side with looks of disbelief on their faces.</p>

  <p>"The middle level of the first class? Possibly the top level of the first class?</p>

  <p>It's impossible! You mean that Luo Zheng has learned a nearly complete text of the Truth of Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>They all knew that to summon such an avatar, the summoner had to comprehend ninety percent of a certain Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>It was hard to believe that Luo Zheng had the power of comprehending so much.</p>

  <p>From what the disciples of the Sword Clan knew, there was no way to get a complete text of the Truth of Divine Dao in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Who could possibly decipher all the Sanskrit words needed to learn so much?</p>

  <p>They had been studying Sanskrit words ever since the debate was held. No person with that skill had been discovered up to now.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan had the most right to comment on this.</p>

  <p>They had spent the longest time studying Sanskrit words, and knew a great deal about them.</p>

  <p>"I do not know why," Reinhard said in a low voice. As his face relaxed into a neutral expression, he went on, "But it's a good thing after all. A great deal of good news! Solomon, deploy the Eye of Perception."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it too early for that?" Solomon questioned.</p>

  <p>"We must inform Holy Marsh of the news as soon as possible," Reinhard answered.</p>

  <p>Solomon nodded, stretched out his fingers, and gently flicked them towards the ground. A small seed buried itself in the ground.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Sword Divine City at the top of the Sunrest Tree, Marsh's eyes fluttered and he smiled. "The seed of the Eye of Perception has been buried. Harold, you can see the scene below using the perception technique I taught you."</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan's perception technique was only a small trick derived from the Cyan Wood Divine Dao. With Harold's talent, he could use it skillfully in an instant.</p>
