  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me you've done nothing but wait here."</p>

  <p>Although he had just said that, Zheng sensed a big difference in Dorothy's Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>The power hidden within was several times stronger than before!</p>

  <p>"Of course not, I have already entered Stage Four!" Dorothy replied, displeased.</p>

  <p>She waited for Zheng here, but he left for the Blue Cloud City without notifying her. If it weren't for the fact that someone didn't allow her to leave the Bloom Divine Province, she might have gone after him.</p>

  <p>"Hold on. Stage Four? So soon?" Zheng took a few steps back as he stared at her completely awestruck.</p>

  <p>However, Dorothy was casual about her achievement. "I have absorbed the soul crystal. You should have been more amazed if I hadn't reached Stage Four. I would have progressed even further if I wasn't waiting for you."</p>

  <p>To be fair, the Other Shore was vast. It wasn't so accurate to divide the different cultivation bases by stages of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Dorothy stood with her arms crossed and an agitated vein protruded from her forehead as she was displeased with Zheng. Affectionately, he lightly patted her on the head and ruffled her hair. "Alright, alright. I won't do that again. Come on, let's go. We have some soul pills to collect. There are too many, and I don't know what to do with them."</p>

  <p>"Too many soul pills? Where did you get them from?" Dorothy tilted her head in confusion and followed Zheng obediently.</p>

  <p>"Just come with me, and you'll see," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Following Zheng, Dorothy found herself back at the entrance of the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>As they approached it, the hundred people Zheng left behind to guard the gate for him were keeping their end of the deal and stood firm blocking it.</p>

  <p>When the people saw two strangers approach the entrance, they were immediately alerted and straightened themselves up nervously.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Dorothy had absorbed the soul crystal. Moreover, Dorothy was already at the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm, and she had been cultivating the Grand Fighting Soul Formula. Her mere presence was overwhelming and imposed pressure on those people.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the situation, one of the men guarding the entrance stepped up, and walked over to them. "You are not allowed to go any further.</p>

  <p>Someone powerful is in there!"</p>

  <p>They knew that they didn't stand a chance against these two. Their best bet was to intimidate them with Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>"Why should I listen to you?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy began to walk over to argue, but Zheng stopped her by blocking her way with his hand. As she looked at him questioningly, he shook his head and turned to the people. "There's no need for you to be so nervous. Just let us in."</p>

  <p>They took their time to recognize who he was because he was in the form of Soul of Light. Even so, he resembled a lot with his physical body. Though his face was hard to make out for them, they identified him by his voice.</p>

  <p>"It's you! Is this your Soul of Light?"</p>

  <p>They narrowed their eyes, seemingly confused.</p>

  <p>When they first saw Zheng appear on the Other Shore with his physical body, naturally, they thought he was something special. They had never seen anyone appear in any form other than their Soul of Light, and they even concluded Zheng to be an aboriginal.</p>

  <p>But now they found out that Zheng had a Soul of Light!</p>

  <p>"It's me indeed," Zheng replied politely.</p>

  <p>Hearing his voice, they cleared the way for both of them to pass through and enter the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>"Why are they so obedient to you?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy was impressed by the scene she had witnessed.</p>

  <p>But, her surprise didn't end here. She was even more shocked when Zheng led her to a secluded corner of the temple where he had stashed the twenty thousand soul pills.</p>

  <p>Normally, an ordinary thing like soul pills wouldn't affect her. However, they were at Stage One, and finding them in abundance in such a barren place, was rare.</p>

  <p>"I smashed down the bricks of the temple and sold them to those people outside," Zheng answered, studying Dorothy's shocked yet confused expression.</p>

  <p>"You knocked down the bricks?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy stared at him in utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>She recalled Zheng had mentioned this idea to her when he first came to the Sacred Mallow Temple, but she never thought he would put it into practice.</p>

  <p>"I sold them at a cheap price, and so they were grateful." Zheng gave his shoulders a light shrug then switched his gaze to the pills. "There are so many of them. I can't figure out where to store them."</p>

  <p>As far as Zheng knew, only the Soul of Light could hold things within on the Other Shore. The physical body couldn't keep anything.</p>

  <p>But the space in the Soul of Light was limited. It was hard to put so many soul pills into it.</p>

  <p>"It's indeed troublesome to carry so many soul pills, but..." Staring at the massive pile, she reached out her hand, and a ray of light spiraled around her fingers and formed a square.</p>

  <p>Surprised by her gesture, Zheng glanced at the square and could feel the Truth of Void Destruction fluctuate within it. "Is this a space ring? There are space rings on the Other Shore as well?"</p>

  <p>"That's right." Dorothy nodded approvingly and continued, "But a space ring is not easy to make on the Other Shore. One must cultivate the Truth of Void Destruction to a very advanced level. You've already joined the Flow Sword Sect. When you reach Stage Four, the palace will give you one."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she knelt near the pills and aimed her space ring at them.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>While the space ring flashed in front of them, it acted like a vacuum as the soul pills quickly got sucked in one by one.</p>

  <p>She would keep them in her possession until Zheng needed them.</p>

  <p>"All right, let's go," Dorothy got up and signaled Zheng to leave.</p>

  <p>"Wait, hold on for a second." Zheng stopped her in her tracks by shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Why? What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>She was confused by his sudden claim, as she couldn't understand why he would want to stay in the Sacred Mallow Temple. The last time she came with Zheng, they were lucky to have obtained a big ball of soul crystal. Other than that, there was nothing special.</p>

  <p>"There should be something inside here," Zheng said with a firm tone.</p>

  <p>"Really? How are you so sure?" Dorothy asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Just wait and watch." Zheng's Soul of Light faded away and he came back in his physical body.</p>

  <p>Then, Dorothy followed him around the temple, and they headed to the spiral-shaped stairs that led to the top.</p>

  <p>Following Zheng's gaze, Dorothy noticed a crack on the wall at the further end of the top floor.</p>

  <p>"I found this crack the last time we came, but couldn't break it with the Soul of Light. This time, it would be different."</p>

  <p>He pointed towards the crack, while closing his distance.</p>

  <p>As he was a few feet away from it, he focused his power onto his fist and jabbed at the crack.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The temple wasn't strong enough to resist his punch.</p>

  <p>As a result, the crack expanded when his fist came in contact with it.</p>

  <p>After a few more of his blows, the wall caved in and collapsed.</p>

  <p>"I knew it!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng expected, there was a secret room behind the crack.</p>

  <p>When they peered into the place, it was pitch-black and desolate. However, as they examined more intently, the view of a floating silhouette made their eyes glisten under the dark setting of the room.</p>

  <p>It was in the shape of a flower branch glimmering in the dark, and it was intricately carved with metal. The shiny flower branch rotated slowly in the air, graciously providing the mysterious room with its light.</p>

  <p>"It does not have any Other Shore Power!" Dorothy exclaimed, keeping her eyes fixated on the metal branch.</p>

  <p>Almost everything on the Other Shore contained Other Shore Power, from a grain of sand to an entire temple. The only deciding factor was how much Other Shore Power they had.</p>

  <p>This flower branch was quite rare since they couldn't sense any Other Shore Power emanating from it.</p>

  <p>"How come something like this exists in the temple of the Dreaded Eye Demons?" Zheng had expected something more.</p>

  <p>He had hoped that there would be some Other Shore Token more powerful than the Eye of Will in this secret room, but this flower branch didn't seem to have any energy, and thus couldn't be fused.</p>
