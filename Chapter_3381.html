<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3381 The Queen Ant </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's perception was sensitive and accurate. As he saw Sally and Chaim come down from his peripheral view, he finally felt relieved.</p>

  <p>A moment earlier, he saw several hundred vicious ants chasing after Sally.</p>

  <p>He knew that it wasn't easy to deal with those creatures, so he was worried about her safety.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't offer her any help since he already turned himself as bait in order to attract more ants into attacking him. The moment he followed her, all the ants would also follow him, leading to a much worse situation.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Sally had Chaim protecting her and his capabilities had lived up to Zheng's expectations.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng withdrew his gaze from Sally and Chaim and composed himself into facing the ants in front of him. As he focused, several rays of sword radiance spiraled out.</p>

  <p>The rest of the wild ants were swallowed by his sword radiance. In an instant, numerous dead bodies of ants filled the cave.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has slaughtered all the ants!" Sally exclaimed as she clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>The members of the Lofty Mountain race, the Moon Spirit race, and the Celestial Wolf race were all overjoyed and sighed with great relief.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it was a splendid moment for the one from the Lofty Mountain race. He was able to survive the ants' siege and it seemed he was also able to acquire some Chaotic Source Spirits. All he needed to do now was wait for the large races to come over and kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, there was just the stone pillar left since all the ants had been slain.</p>

  <p>With their combined skills and efforts, it should not be a problem to destroy it easily.</p>

  <p>However, as they started approaching the pillar, Zheng suddenly felt a strong surge of force from within it.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, red ants quickly came out of the small holes on the pillar.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed an enormous amount of energy stored within their bodies as they rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>"More ants are coming!"</p>

  <p>"Be careful! Each ant contains an astonishing amount of energy."</p>

  <p>"Move back! Hurry up and step back!"</p>

  <p>The three members of the other races who had just come down hurriedly retreated back to the upward passage.</p>

  <p>A few dozens of red ants came to sight.</p>

  <p>They were much lesser in number compared to the horde of wild ants that Zheng had slaughtered earlier, but he knew that he needed to be cautious as they were far stronger than the previous bunch.</p>

  <p>As one of the red ants that approached Zheng was only a few steps away from him, the bright red pigment on its body surface began to boil. In the blink of an eye, the fierce energy made it explode in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The shock wave produced by the explosion of the red ant sent Zheng flying backward.</p>

  <p>Even Chaim and Sally, who were relatively far away, were affected by the shock wave and were blown backward, hitting the mountain walls again.</p>

  <p>They were surprised as it was just the strength of a single red ant. The rest of the red ants started chasing Zheng and didn't give him a chance to counterattack.</p>

  <p>"I was too careless," Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He thought that if those dozens of red ants exploded at the same time, his body would likely be crushed to pieces.</p>

  <p>But he already learned from that mistake and wouldn't let them have another chance. As the red ants rushed towards him again, he released his energy, turning his arms, face, and chest to pitch black.</p>

  <p>After being fully prepared, Zheng stabbed one ant with his sword.</p>

  <p>As the sword radiance cut the red ant open, it immediately exploded and caused a huge shock wave.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had already made adjustments with his body. Upon receiving the shock wave, his body smoothly followed through the impact and landed steadily in a distance. Then, he began stabbing the other red ants that came at him.</p>

  <p>Each of Zheng's strike would cause a red ant to detonate. While the ants exploded one by one, he would just glide over and change his position to attack the remaining ones.</p>

  <p>More and more red ants were detonated as Zheng continued his skillful attack.</p>

  <p>Before long, the last red ant exploded and the cave fell silent again.</p>

  <p>They were caught off guard when they carelessly approached the stone pillar earlier.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng waited for a while before making any move to the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>As he stood from a distance, a pair of huge white jaws suddenly surfaced from the bottom of the stone pillar. These jaws bit the pillar and a huge hole appeared.</p>

  <p>Seeing the scene clearly, everyone was stunned.</p>

  <p>They knew how sturdy the pillar was. As the Chaotic Source Spirits were hidden in it, they would have a hard time destroying it, even with their combined efforts.</p>

  <p>However, with a single bite from the huge white jaws, a large hole was created.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is that?</p>

  <p>How could it destroy the pillar so easily?" Sally uttered in a nervous tone.</p>

  <p>"It's the queen ant. It's crawling out of the pillar!" Panic was written all over Chaim's face.</p>

  <p>"The queen ant has such great power?" A wrinkle on Zheng's forehead was formed as he realized the formidable strength of their foe.</p>

  <p>For the queen ant to destroy the stone pillar, it must have possessed tens of thousands of divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>The habits and nature of ants were all the same across every species. The poisonous ants that they first encountered should be the ordinary workforce.</p>

  <p>They were responsible for acquiring food for the queen ant and the rest of the colony. The red ants that could self-destruct were the battle-type. They would sacrifice themselves if they needed to, just to protect the queen ant.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had killed all the worker and soldier ants, the queen ant crawled out personally.</p>

  <p>The white translucent queen ant was as long as a human being and had a huge abdomen. Everyone's attention was caught by its unusually huge abdomen as it crawled out from the bottom of the pillar.</p>

  <p>There was something in the queen ant's abdomen that made the members of the other races fix their eyes on it with greedy stares.</p>

  <p>There, lying in its translucent abdomen were several precious amber crystals.</p>

  <p>"Are those Chaotic Source Spirits?"</p>

  <p>"There are so many of them! Did the queen ant swallow them all?"</p>

  <p>"No wonder it can easily destroy the stone pillar with a single blow!"</p>

  <p>They clearly saw the Chaotic Source Spirits in the queen ant's abdomen. It was the queen ant that made the stone pillar so solid.</p>

  <p>The white queen ant did not take any immediate action after it showed itself.</p>

  <p>It slightly crawled on the ground with its loaded abdomen while the humongous jaws shook. The tentacles on its head shuddered to perceive the surrounding environment as it exuded a ferocious aura.</p>

  <p>"It has so many Chaotic Source Spirits in its stomach. Even if it hasn't refined them, it would still possess tremendous strength comparable to the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm," Chaim noted with a bitter smile as he shook his head. "Zheng, we don't stand a chance. Let's just escape while we can."</p>

  <p>No one here knew better than Chaim if it came to the strength of the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>He, together with the outstanding disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace like Efrain, had stayed at the Land of Sword Grief for quite some time.</p>

  <p>Not everyone in the Land of Sword Grief was strong. Most of them had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, meaning that they weren't strong enough to be the backbone of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Efrain had once battled with those who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but he didn't even hurt them a little bit. Although the cultivation level of Efrain's opponents was above his, Chaim was greatly shocked to observe the huge gap in strength. He firmly believed that he wouldn't be able to defeat warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm unless he underwent the Chaotic Source Reinforcement as well.</p>

  <p>However, last time, Zheng had proved this to be wrong. With the help of the Civilization Artifact, he easily took down Chance in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, due to Jean's intervention, the matter was only known to a few people of the Phoenix Palace. They didn't let the other disciples know about it.</p>

  <p>"It's not at the Chaotic Source Realm, trust me." Zheng stared at the queen ant and continued, "And even if it is, there must be a way to defeat it."</p>

  <p>Considering the number of Chaotic Source Spirits that were in the possession of the queen ant, Zheng was unwilling to leave and just let go of the opportunity.</p>
