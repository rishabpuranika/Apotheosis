  <p>
</p>

  <p>With the fire token, Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the embryo of the Great Weighty Sword from the weapon refining workshop before.</p>

  <p>He hardly expected anything to be inside the pill refining furnace in front of him. He stood there, while trying to gauge the contents inside.</p>

  <p>After mulling over, he walked towards the furnace, with the intention of opening it.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to pry open the lid, Saul rushed past him and pressed the lid with his hand, facing Luo Luo Zheng. Saul said furiously, "Don't open! Stay away from it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned looking at Saul's reaction.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of the fact that if the pills in this workshop were all extraordinary, the pills in the furnace would be even more precious. But he was not in need of any of these pills. Until now, he had relied on his own talent and perseverance to cultivate. His excellent shape was the proof of that.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Saul sternly stopped him, "You shouldn't be taking off the lid!"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I open the lid? Why are you creating so much suspense around it?!" Looking at Saul's reaction, Luo Luo Zheng became even more curious.</p>

  <p>Saul pointed to the corner saying, "All the seven times refined pill present here were refined within that furnace."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked in the direction that Saul pointed. In the corner of the workshop, there was another furnace which looked almost exactly the same as the one in front of him, but it was comparatively smaller.</p>

  <p>Despite Luo Zheng's experience, he was unable to understand the functioning of this furnace. But of course, any furnace used by the Holy Being was way out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>"What is this furnace used for?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, pointing at the first furnace.</p>

  <p>"Although it's been a long time, I clearly remember that my master used it to refine the eight times refined pills," Saul replied.</p>

  <p>"Eight times refined pills? Just one level higher than the seven times refined pills in this room?" Luo Luo Zheng didn't care much for the eight times refined pills. He felt a bit disappointed at this new piece of information.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was for refining the nine times refined pills."</p>

  <p>Saul laughed. "Nine times refined pills? Seriously?! Don't even think about it! For what I know, there are only two nine times refined pills recorded in the history of the divine land for countless divine eras. How they were used and who took them are still mysteries even today. So theoretically speaking, the eight times refined pills are the highest level pills within the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Then why didn't you let me take off the lid?" Luo Luo Zheng persisted.</p>

  <p>"The eight times refined pill in here is not bound." Saying this, Saul pointed to the golden cauldrons which were the size of a water cup and contained the seven times refined pills. "Look over here. These seven times refined pills are bound by the medicinal cauldrons, so even if they have souls, it is highly impossible for them to take form. They can only release their souls to roam around the workshop. On the contrary, the furnace here does not have any binding on the eight times refined pill, so the pill may have been transformed. If you take off the lid at will, I'm afraid it might kill you in a flash!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was shocked at what Saul said. "I don't believe it! How can a tiny pill be all that powerful?"</p>

  <p>Sensing that Luo Luo Zheng still hadn't grasped the importance of the pills, Saul patiently explained, "If these seven times refined pills were to take human form, their strength would be equivalent to that of a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>So you can imagine the potency of this pill."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng was completely overcome with shock.</p>

  <p>His gaze once again returned to the seven times refined pills. In other words, if not for the golden medicinal cauldrons binding them, Luo Luo Zheng would probably be facing a group of True Gods in this workshop! What a predicament he would have been in!</p>

  <p>"And what about the eight times refined pill?" Now Luo Luo Zheng became curious about it and asked.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, the eight times refined pill in the furnace has the power of a mid-rank or maybe even a top-rank True God," Saul replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing Saul's explanation, Luo Luo Zheng was completely convinced now. If the furnace really contained a mid-rank True God, he would definitely die if he casually took off the lid. However, there was one thing he did not understand. "According to what you said, the pills are comparable to True Gods. Don't tell me that they are able to condense the Godly Tiles."</p>

  <p>Without the Godly Tile, it was impossible to gather momentum and there was no inner world. This actually made no sense at all.</p>

  <p>"You're right. They can definitely condense the Godly Tiles, and they have a natural advantage in that aspect. After taking human form, the pills will become living beings, and they can cultivate the Pill Divine Dao. In fact, all living things in the divine land have souls, and once they reach a certain point, they can transform themselves into any being they want. Many True Gods in the divine land are transformed from mountains, stones, and even broken swords," Saul explained.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing these words, Luo Luo Zheng recalled the broken sword in Lone's hand.</p>

  <p>As he thought about many True Gods that were transformed from stones and mountains, he had a strange feeling in his heart. If he had the chance to go to the divine land, then he would have a good look around. There were many questions which could be answered only at the divine land.</p>

  <p>Now that he stepped into the pill refining room, there was no way he would return empty-handed. He couldn't touch the eight times refined pill in the furnace, but he could at least use some of the seven times refined pills that were easily available.</p>

  <p>Normally, Luo Luo Zheng didn't prefer pills because they were filled with impurities. Even in the Upper World, if he used any of the pills to benefit himself, there would be several repercussions on his foundation. But the pills his master refined were different. They would not create any side effects.</p>

  <p>Moreover, right now was the time for him to increase his strength. There should be some pills around that could be useful.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked along the cabinets. Saul realized that Luo Luo Zheng was choosing pills for himself, so he followed him. He was ready to answer if Luo Luo Zheng had any queries.</p>

  <p>"What is this Frigid Jade Illusion Pill?"</p>

  <p>"It is used to cultivate the Snow Divine Dao. It can greatly nourish the Mysterious Ice Godly Tile."</p>

  <p>"Mystery Life Pill?"</p>

  <p>"Excellent to remove doubts."</p>

  <p>"Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill?"</p>

  <p>"It can break through the Godly Tile barrier."</p>

  <p>"Glossy Ganoderma Soul Pill?"</p>

  <p>"It is ideal for soul cultivation."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng read out the name of a pill, Saul would instantly state its use.</p>

  <p>But even without Saul's help, it was easy to understand their uses through their physical characteristics. The Frigid Jade Illusion Pill, for example, was like a ball of ice. Within the ball, there were illusions that were constantly changing. The speed at which the illusions changed was ridiculously fast, so Luo Luo Zheng couldn't clearly see what the illusions were recording.</p>

  <p>Soon Luo Luo Zheng realized that the seven times refined pills wouldn't provide much help to him at the current stage. They were for True Gods, while Luo Luo Zheng was a world lord now.</p>

  <p>Moreover, his Lotus Flower hadn't even fully bloomed, which was a cause of concern for him.</p>

  <p>Ever since their return from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Lotus Flowers of Nathan, Lucille and the others had already been in full bloom. After all, after becoming world lords, the Godly Geniuses would begin to strive to be True Gods in an attempt to condense the Godly Tiles. However, Luo Zheng's Lotus Flower hadn't fully bloomed, let alone condensed the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>His perception was not lower than any of the other nine Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>In fact Luo Luo Zheng was the strongest among the Godly Geniuses, and yet his Lotus Flower hadn't fully bloomed after he became a world lord. For the life of him, he could not understand what went wrong.</p>

  <p>"Nine-head Snake Blood Pill?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was focused on a blood-red pill. He could instantly feel an extremely strong blood energy from this pill. Luo Luo Zheng immediately guessed it before Saul could explain its usage.</p>

  <p>"Master, looks like this pill is only made for you!"</p>

  <p>In fact, Saul had wanted to recommend the Nine-head Snake Blood Pill to Luo Luo Zheng from the start, but as a servant of the Immortal Mansion, he was not in a position to advice Luo Luo Zheng. Now that he saw Luo Luo Zheng stop on his own in front of the pill, he took the opportunity to give his opinion.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Zheng's body's recovery ability was quite weak.</p>

  <p>The Nine-head Snake Blood Pill probably had the lowest value among the seven times refined pills.</p>

  <p>However, it did not require Luo Zheng's cultivation to be strong or weak. Just by merely swallowing it, he would greatly enhance his recovery ability.</p>

  <p>"Good." Even if Saul didn't give his opinion, Luo Luo Zheng would have still chosen this pill. Then he reached out and took the Nine-head Snake Blood Pill.</p>

  <p>However, just as he took away the pill, his gaze shifted to the other side where there was another seven times refined pill, the Emotion Closing Pill.</p>

  <p>"Master, since you cultivate the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, this pill is also ideal for you. But your level of cultivation is too low, so you can swallow the Nine-head Snake Blood Pill. However, the Emotion Closing Pill is for a True God who cultivates the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>You may not be able to withstand it, if you take it without careful consideration," Saul patiently explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled slightly and reached out his hand to take the Emotion Closing Pill. "Since the Emotion Closing Divine Dao is considered a forbidden Divine Dao within the divine land, then this pill is considered a forbidden pill, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right," Saul agreed.</p>

  <p>Ever since he cultivated the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, Luo Luo Zheng had always relied on malicious Mu Ning to suppress his emotions. However, this was only a helpless compromise.</p>

  <p>If he advanced to a higher level in the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, he would definitely be able to fight against the True Gods from the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>With this thought, he reached out his hand and took the Emotion Closing Pill, despite Saul refraining him from doing so.</p>
