  <p>
</p>

  <p>Rachelle had difficulty comprehending the task. It just didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>But since Murphy had personally given the order, she had no choice but to follow the instruction.</p>

  <p>"It must be an extremely important clue, so we have to chase after that True God," Shahn replied blandly. "The chief of our clan said that the Dongfang Clan is going to seal off these thirteen regions."</p>

  <p>"Seal off the thirteen regions?" Rachelle was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>The area of a region was not small, and even the Holy Beings could not fully seal them off unless with the help of some treasures.</p>

  <p>For example, the Dongfang Clan used the Ray Tree, and the Sword Clan used the Sunrest Tree to block the Space Law of a region.</p>

  <p>After the sealing, the Grand Teleportation and construction of a transmission channel would be prohibited.</p>

  <p>Seeing the expression on Rachelle's face, Shahn said lightly, "They are going to use the Ruling Slate again!"</p>

  <p>"They have to seal off the thirteen regions just to hunt down a True God?" Rachelle said with a gleam in her eyes. "Who the hell is this True God?"</p>

  <p>Shahn shrugged. "I have no idea, but the chief of my clan looked furious.</p>

  <p>The True God must be very important, I bet."</p>

  <p>They continued talking for a while before flying to the air to begin their mission.</p>

  <p>At the exact same time, Nicholas was standing in front of the Ruling Slate with his writing brush in hand and started to write a new rule swiftly and without hesitation.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings, the revisions of the rules on the Ruling Slate must be approved by all the Holy Beings of the hall.</p>

  <p>However, at the moment, the Hall of Holy Beings existed in name only.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan and the Moon Clan were silent. The Holy Beings of these two clans had rarely appeared in the Hall of Holy Beings. Now the hall was ruled by the voice of Nicholas alone.</p>

  <p>So he used the Ruling Slate at will as if it was his personal object.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Nicholas finished writing, a golden light flashed on the rule, which meant that it had come into force.</p>

  <p>Sealing off the thirteen regions wasn't a very overbearing rule. It wouldn't consume a lot of divine might coins.</p>

  <p>But Nicholas' face was pale.</p>

  <p>The cultivation level of the outsiders in the divine land had exceeded his expectations. This worried him greatly.</p>

  <p>The very first step they had to take was to find out who had been sent to the divine land, so it was very necessary to write this rule.</p>

  <p>"Sir, if you would like, you can join our Square Sky City. My clan welcomes all kinds of talents." The top-rank True God knew that Zheng was very strong, so he had already dispelled the evil intentions in his heart, and followed Zheng with a warm smile.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the energy from the Godly Way, Zheng had planned to find a secret place and use the mountain token to return to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected the True God to follow him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested," Zheng said coldly, thinking about how to get rid of him.</p>

  <p>"Our clan is considered as one of the powerful clans in the entire divine land, and our Floating Island is also ranked top above the Time Sea. You know, it's hard to get an opportunity like this..." The True God was being very patient. He kept on following Zheng, trying to persuade him.</p>

  <p>"I told you, I'm not interested. I'm warning you for the last time. Leave me alone, or there will be severe consequences." Zheng lost his patience and his eyes had turned cold, with a murderous look on his face.</p>

  <p>The hostile look on Zheng's face was terrifying and made the True God tremble with fear. He gave an awkward smile and finally stopped, following Zheng's footsteps with only his eyes.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, two beams of light shot towards him from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The two were none other than Shahn and Rachelle.</p>

  <p>"Two consummate True Gods?"</p>

  <p>The True God looked back and his heart trembled.</p>

  <p>Although he had a high status in the Fang Clan, he was not eligible to enter the Floating Island, so he didn't know Shahn Fang.</p>

  <p>But he knew that no matter who these newcomers were, it would be wise not to offend them.</p>

  <p>"Who is in charge of this place?" Shahn's majestic voice rang out as he remained floating in the air.</p>

  <p>The True God looked up at Shahn in the air and said respectfully, "It is me. I'm in charge of this Godly Way Tablet. If I may, could I please ask your name?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Shahn Fang," Shahn replied, and then he asked, "Have there been any stranger here today?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Shahn announced his name, there was a buzz around the Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>The masters of the Fang Clan were well-known in the Square Sky Region. Although Shahn was not a Holy Being, he was the most powerful consummate True God of the Fang Clan, so he had a great reputation in the Square Sky Region. The crowd regarded him with reverence.</p>

  <p>Shahn seemed to enjoy the attention. A self-satisfied smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"Stranger?" The True God was slightly stunned. He could not help turning his head to look at Zheng, who was quickly walking away.</p>

  <p>There had only been one stranger there today.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Rachelle stared at Zheng's receding back with sharp eyes.</p>

  <p>She had felt that something was not right, but she didn't pay much attention to Zheng because he had concealed his strength.</p>

  <p>"You! Stop!" Rachelle's cold voice floated over.</p>

  <p>However, the moment she spoke, Zheng had already jumped up and flew forward.</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed in his heart. What an unlucky coincidence. He had chosen a space channel randomly, and he still ended up meeting Rachelle and Shahn.</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't know that the Floating Islands had already responded as soon as he had arrived.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he soared into the sky and flew forward.</p>

  <p>Rachelle and Shahn stared at each other. Zheng refused to stop and tried to flee.</p>

  <p>"Chase him!"</p>

  <p>The duo's faces darkened. They transformed into two beams of light and chased after Zheng, leaving the top-rank True God in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had stopped hiding his cultivation level and moved forward as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>Behind him, Rachelle and Shahn were hot on his trail.</p>

  <p>The three flew at an extremely fast speed. Within seconds, they had flown past dozens of mountains.</p>

  <p>Although the three of them had reached the consummation of True God Realm, Zheng was still a beginner, so he couldn't go as fast as he wanted to.</p>

  <p>The distance between them was beginning to lessen.</p>

  <p>"It can't go on like this."</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. An aura of the Space Law spread out in front of him. He decided to try to use the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>However, when he was about to drill into the space channel, a flash of weird lightning appeared in the sky and shot down.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The lightning shattered the space channel built by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also affected by this lightning and let out a muffled snort. There was nothing he could do but resist the lightning, so his flying speed was greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>Seizing this opportunity, Rachelle and Shahn cornered Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The entire space of the Square Sky Region has been blocked, but you still tried to use the Grand Teleportation technique." Rachelle stood in front of Zheng to block his way. When she finally saw Zheng's face, she arched her beautiful eyebrows in shock. "What a small world. Who would have thought that the True God we are hunting down is you?"</p>
