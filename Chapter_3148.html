<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3148 The Chaotic Source Reinforcement </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman in the black dress was as beautiful as one could imagine, yet something about her made people uneasy in her presence. Perhaps it was pure intimidation.</p>

  <p>The man sensed her power, which certainly caught his attention. He grinned darkly and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"You wish to know my name?" The woman smiled an evilly playful smile and offered a challenge, "Kill it, and you will find out."</p>

  <p>As the words rolled off her tongue, the monster beneath her feet began to stir. dozens of broken arms and legs of all kinds crawled across the ground and rushed towards the man in a crazed hunger to tear him apart.</p>

  <p>The man snorted at the advancing monster and the Ways-blending Energy surged out in a torrent of waves. It then transformed into crescents and crashed into the monster.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Powerful Ways-blending Energy flew everywhere, some striking the woman.</p>

  <p>But it didn't bother her tender white skin in the slightest. It barely even shook her bangs, which hung still and heavy on her forehead.</p>

  <p>She did not care whether the monster could defeat the man. She merely used it as a means to observe the operation of the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>'There are indeed twelve layers.</p>

  <p>In the past, there were seven methods of using the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>One of the perfect ones was the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>People who created the seven methods were of the same generation as the captain, but this person's method does not belong to any of the seven.</p>

  <p>Did a peerless master create this method? That can't be the case. The blending of Godly Ways has proven to be fruitless. No one would attempt it again. Is it possible he created it himself?'</p>

  <p>The woman was staggered at the very idea of this.</p>

  <p>While she pondered these things, the monster under her feet had already suffered to the point that a large hole gaped in its body. If the man were to attack just a few more times, it would be shattered to pieces once more.</p>

  <p>"Show me your real strength," the woman in black said as she lightly tapped her toe on the ground.</p>

  <p>The black deathly energy flowed within the broken limbs and swirled around the monster. Its strength increased unbelievably while a violent, diabolical aura exuded from its body.</p>

  <p>Finally, the man's expression changed.</p>

  <p>"That's not enough!" the man roared, releasing the Ways-blending Energy again.</p>

  <p>It was in the shape of crescents before, but it now morphed into a diamond with a layered surface.</p>

  <p>The woman in black glanced at it and soon deciphered the number of layers. "There are actually twenty-one layers!" she exclaimed flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>She had struggled to figure out the number of layers from the crescent-shaped Ways-blending Energy with her eyes, but she could only sense it, which meant the man had controlled it pretty well. But he should have known that the more the layers, the harder it was for him to control the Ways-blending Energy. After reaching twelve layers, he could only change the shape and not hide the number of layers.</p>

  <p>This method might have been simple and crude, but it was effective and powerful. More importantly, he had definitely developed it himself.</p>

  <p>The woman was about to amplify the monster's strength even further when a deafening screech pierced her ears.</p>

  <p>The monster had already been turned to a pile of ashes.</p>

  <p>All she could see was a white glow enveloping her view.</p>

  <p>Before it cleared, a figure rushed at her. The man wrung her neck with one hand and planted his knee into her abdomen with such ferocity that the air around them shook.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The woman was pressed to the ground.</p>

  <p>The man had acted swiftly, knowing the woman possessed a power beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to have any sort of chance, he had to catch her unawares.</p>

  <p>"I like beautiful women like you. How about being my wife? Haha! That would be something, but it's a shame you have to die!"</p>

  <p>He grinned devilishly as he gathered a diamond-shaped Ways-blending Energy and without hesitation stabbed it with all he could at the woman's face.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-nine layers! My God! How many layers of the Ways-blending Energy can he summon?"</p>

  <p>The woman in black didn't resist or move. All her attention was focused on the Ways-blending Energy. She seemed not to care about life or death at all.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Blazing white light exploded again.</p>

  <p>The man knew this power was enough to destroy anything.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the woman was, she couldn't withstand a blow like that.</p>

  <p>When the light faded, there in front of the man, appeared the stunningly beautiful and unharmed face of the woman.</p>

  <p>There wasn't even a scratch on her.</p>

  <p>Even her hair spread loosely and perfectly on the ground.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of any kind of blow to her face, not even the slightest imperfection.</p>

  <p>Seeing the man's dumbfounded expression, the woman smiled sweetly and asked, "Have you heard of the Chaotic Source Reinforcement?"</p>

  <p>She did not mind being held down by the man. She continued on, not bothered, as if telling a story, "When you reach a certain level on the Other Shore, there will be a limit for how many divine megatons of force you can bear. No matter who you are, you will not be able to take any more, or your body will be destroyed by the Other Shore Power. If you want to continue to move forward on the Other Shore, you have to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. This will strengthen your body considerably."</p>

  <p>"So... You have undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement?" the man asked coldly and with a hint of a stammer.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the woman in black replied happily. "So no matter how strong you are now, you are like an ant biting a piece of iron. There is nothing you can do to hurt me."</p>

  <p>As those words fell on the man's ears, his soul sank and he wished he could disappear forever.</p>

  <p>He was highly talented.</p>

  <p>But it was a pity that he had been trapped in an inner world and knew too little about this place.</p>

  <p>The woman spoke of things beyond his imagination and comprehension.</p>

  <p>Even so, he had absolutely no intention of begging for mercy. He stared at the woman with an icy look, though he knew he was helpless now. He had just used all his strength and couldn't leave so much as a dent on the woman. What options did he have now?</p>

  <p>The woman twisted her body gruesomely and unnaturally. She slowly wrapped her arm around the man.</p>

  <p>Her seemingly soft body contained an immense amount of power, too much for him to fight against.</p>

  <p>It did not take long for her to push the man to the ground. She smiled down at the man full of glee and pity. "You are quite bold. But you are far from qualified to be my husband. How about my disciple instead?"</p>

  <p>The man didn't expect such a request. If it were someone else, they would have agreed immediately. But now, the man laughed grimly. "Since I, the Evil God, was born, I've been self-taught. No one in this world can be my master! I'd rather you kill me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh? Your name is Evil God? Interesting!"</p>

  <p>The woman could not hold back her laughter on hearing such an arrogant name. "Do you really think I can't kill you because you have a Rebirth Land?" she asked, giggling and shaming the man.</p>
