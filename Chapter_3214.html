<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "A man whose heart is not content is like a snake that tries to swallow an elephant." Arjun had absorbed all the memory fragments into his mind and interpreted them.</p>

  <p>It wasn't an elephant that he had swallowed. It was much larger than that. A whale.</p>

  <p>A massive amount of memories poured out, raging at Arjun's soul. He fainted, unable to bear the weight of the memories.</p>

  <p>The woman in red glared at Zheng and shouted, "What did you do to him?"</p>

  <p>Zheng spread his arms out and shrugged, indicating that he hadn't done anything.</p>

  <p>The woman waved her hand, causing a loud "bang" to reverberate through the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt like he had been hit by a heavy hammer. His body flew backward and crashed into the palace wall.</p>

  <p>Even through the pain, he wondered what material this palace was made of.</p>

  <p>The wall had only bent a little under such great force.</p>

  <p>Zheng leaned against the wall, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p>

  <p>The woman was so strong, she had managed to injure him a little despite the protection of the Shade Stone liquid.</p>

  <p>She looked coldly at him, although she was a little surprised as well.</p>

  <p>She had thought she could beat Zheng into unconsciousness, but the blow had hardly made a difference, much to her surprise.</p>

  <p>"Lock him up!" she ordered before turning around and leaving.</p>

  <p>Two men in black walked up to Zheng and dragged him to the back of the palace. One of them stomped his feet, causing the floor of the palace to crack open. A large square hole appeared, and they threw Zheng in.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't resist during the whole process.</p>

  <p>These people were much more powerful than him and he knew that it would be useless to resist. If he did, there would be serious consequences and he could get seriously hurt.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unusually calm as he sat up cross legged in the cave and began to heal himself.</p>

  <p>On one hand, the Vastness Mountain feared the Oneness Sky Palace. On the other hand, they also wanted to obtain the Truth Enlightenment. Going by this logic, Zheng knew he was safe for the time being, but wasn't sure what they would do to deal with him next.</p>

  <p>He had managed to get through it this time with No. 9527's help. But he might not make it the next time.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Master Athemar or Master Goran will come to save me," Zheng murmured to himself as he stared at the dark cave wall.</p>

  <p>The woman in red left the gloomy palace and disappeared at the palace gate in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Pillars formed by black iron swords sat atop the Vastness Mountain, holding a bluish black palace amidst them.</p>

  <p>This was the center of the Vastness Mountain, the Mighty Sword Hall.</p>

  <p>The woman appeared at the gate of this hall and quickly walked inside.</p>

  <p>The guards of the hall, on seeing her approach, knelt down in unison.</p>

  <p>"Good day, Lady Natasha!"</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you, Lady Natasha!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Natasha, Emperor Gethin doesn't want to see anyone at the moment."</p>

  <p>A mole sat on Natasha's forehead. Its maroon color made it look like blood was dripping down her forehead. The guards knew she was furious, but they had been instructed not to let anyone enter the Mighty Sword Hall.</p>

  <p>They had no choice but to stop Natasha, even though they knew she was far above their station.</p>

  <p>Natasha was nettled.</p>

  <p>She waved a hand without even looking at them.</p>

  <p>They were sent flying backwards and fell to the ground with a heavy thud.</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man with a long beard sat on a large golden throne at the top of the Mighty Sword Hall. He looked energetic, his eyes shining sharp as blades.</p>

  <p>This was Emperor Gethin, the head of the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Two black shadows stood beside Gethin. It was hard to see their faces in the dim light. One could only vaguely make out their human shapes.</p>

  <p>These two men were the leaders of the intelligence agency. They lowered their heads to whisper something to Gethin.</p>

  <p>Gethin raised his hand. The two men had already noticed the beautiful lady walk in and stepped aside to merge into the shadows.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Natasha's face, Gethin smiled gently and said, "Natasha, what makes you so angry?"</p>

  <p>"That brat refused to tell us anything! He says he will only give us one hundred and fifty words!" Natasha spat out angrily.</p>

  <p>Gethin stroked his long beard thoughtfully and then said, "What he says actually fits the information we first received."</p>

  <p>"He must be lying!" Natasha said, her eyebrows shooting up.</p>

  <p>She actually wasn't sure if Zheng had lied or not. People like Natasha usually insisted on getting what they wanted. So she had chosen to believe that Zheng had lied to her.</p>

  <p>"So what if he lied? Didn't I send Arjun to help you?" Gethin asked.</p>

  <p>Natasha's eyes flashed at the mention of Arjun's name. "I don't know what trick the brat played. Everything went smoothly when Arjun was extracting his memories. But he passed out before he could find out anything useful."</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul level was outstanding, but there was a huge difference between his soul and Arjun's, which was why Zheng couldn't use his soul to attack Arjun. Natasha was puzzled at this and didn't know why Arjun had passed out.</p>

  <p>Gethin's expression cleared, pure interest taking its place on his face. "He caused Arjun to pass out? Interesting! Bring Arjun here!"</p>

  <p>Natasha could do nothing but follow Gethin's orders. She asked her people to bring Arjun to Gethin. He was soon carried into the Mighty Sword Hall.</p>

  <p>Gethin raised his hand slightly and the unconscious Arjun floated up slowly. He pointed a finger at Arjun, a ray of brown light shooting into his mind. He stirred and it wasn't long before he began to wake up.</p>

  <p>As he sat up and saw the man before him, Arjun was startled and then knelt down on the floor respectfully. "Greetings, Emperor Gethin!" he said.</p>

  <p>"You have been using the Soul Searching Hand for many years, and you are already confident in its usage. Why can't you deal with a little guy who is still in the Lust World?" Gethin asked calmly.</p>

  <p>When Arjun recalled what he had read in Zheng's memories, his features convulsed back into shock.</p>

  <p>"That bloke is not human at all!" he said, his eyes widening.</p>

  <p>How could a person have so many memories?</p>

  <p>There were too many memories in the fragments. One of the memories was watching the sun rise and fall for ten billion years until the sun self-destructed.</p>

  <p>Zheng was only over a hundred years old. How could he have watched the sun rise and fall for ten billion years? How could someone of this world do such a boring thing for so many years?</p>

  <p>Even the members of the Stone race, which had a long history, and the members of the Turtle race, which moved extremely slow, would not do such a thing.</p>

  <p>At Arjun's words, Gethin, Natasha, and even the two leaders of the intelligence agency in the shadows were astonished. How could there be such bizarre memories in this world?</p>

  <p>"He has probably fused with a special Other Shore Token. Maybe these weird memories belong to that token," Gethin said hopefully, after thinking for a while. Most Other Shore Tokens held a certain number of memories.</p>

  <p>And despite the hope with which he was talking, Gethin had never heard of an Other Shore Token possessing such a massive amount of memories.</p>

  <p>"The question is how we can make Zheng speak?" Natasha sighed.</p>

  <p>One of the two leaders of the intelligence agency suggested, "There are many ways of making people talk, like using brutal corporal punishment. I don't think he can bear it."</p>
