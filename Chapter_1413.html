  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Mist Palace were very diligent.</p>

  <p>To any cultivator, being given a chance to enter the Mist Palace was enough to make them proud among their entire generation.</p>

  <p>However, after these so called talented warriors from supreme worlds gathered there, they discovered that their past pride and power were nothing compared to what was on display in the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning, a warrior named Gorman Gao, carrying his maple-leaf spear, entered the Sword Practicing Hall. He had once been the absolute pride of his family. Ever since he had become a warrior, he had been surrounded by envious gazes from all of his relatives.</p>

  <p>After successfully joining an eighth-grade sacred place, his remarkable ability had quickly attracted the attention of a tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Then he was brought to that tenth-grade sacred place, and had even taken the lord of the sacred place as his master. Afterwards, his master had tried every means possible to succeed in sending him to the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Gorman Gao had thought that with his great talent, he would definitely be able to become one of the most powerful warriors in the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Yet his dreams had come crashing down on him.</p>

  <p>After arriving there, he had begun to feel self-abased and disappointed.</p>

  <p>He had once been proud of himself for activating a Lotus Flower with one lotus petal. It was a symbol of surpassing the heavens. But he saw that there were numerous warriors of the Mist Palace who could activate even more petals of the Lotus Flowers, and he was a nobody among them. He even didn't have the qualifications to take part in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>However, a talent should not just be arrogant. After adjusting his attitude, Gorman Gao had forced himself to work hard and face his difficulties. He believed that one day, he would be able to get his own glory there.</p>

  <p>After cultivating in seclusion for a long time, he was now rushing over to the Sword Practicing Hall. He wanted to test practice the "Potent Ether Blood"? the thirteenth move of the "Potent Blood Spear" that he had comprehended over the last few days. This move's power was extremely fierce and overbearing, and it was likely to have a good effect.</p>

  <p>However, after he entered the Illusion Space, he heard the rumbling sounds which were going on for a long time.</p>

  <p>Thunder? Gorman Gao was stunned, but how could there be thunder in the Illusion Space?</p>

  <p>This made him very confused...</p>

  <p>However, just as he was wondering what had happened, he suddenly realized that there seemed to be something strange about the huge Golden-silver Demon Mountain. Something was there which shouldn't be.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the mountain, there was a long, thin crack, almost negligible, were it not for its extreme length. It went from top to bottom, spreading all the way until it went beyond Gorman's sight!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Gorman Gao was really surprised and there was bewilderment visible on his face from miles away.</p>

  <p>What was going on?</p>

  <p>Was there someone practicing the sword just now? Since the booming sounds were still echoing in the air, the warrior practicing the sword shouldn't have gone too far. But when he had entered there, Gorman Gao didn't see anyone, and he also didn't meet any other warriors along the way.</p>

  <p>Gorman Gao of course did not know that there was a warrior who had practiced the sword there earlier, but had already left a long time ago.</p>

  <p>Being naturally curious, he flew down along the crack. However, even after flying for a long time, he was still unable to find the end of the crack. In the end, he had to choose to fly up. This time, he spent twice as much time flying up, but still couldn't see the end.</p>

  <p>During this process, he became more and more aghast. 'Who on earth created this crack? Who on earth even could?'</p>

  <p>For warriors with high enough cultivation bases, destroying a mountain range with a single move wasn't difficult, and even Gorman Gao himself could do it.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the Golden-silver Demon Mountain in the Illusion Space was not an ordinary mountain. Even if Gorman Gao were to unleash his full strength, he would only be able to leave a mark of about a hundred miles on the mountain.</p>

  <p>He was not that powerful and was not worth mentioning in the Mist Palace where there were so many talents. But even so, such a long crack?</p>

  <p>A year ago, he had coincidentally met Javier who was ranked first in the Swallow Cloud House. Although the latter was only at the ninth level of the Life and Death Realm, with a casual swing of his sword, he had left a mark about a thousand miles long on the Golden-silver Demon Mountain.</p>

  <p>But now, Gorman Gao was very astonished to discover an endless crack which stretched for countless thousands of miles. He had no idea what had happened in here.</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, he left the Illusion Space. He then walked to a corner of the Sword Practicing Hall. There was a tall curtain hanging at the corner of the hall.</p>

  <p>All attacks at the Golden-silver Demon Mountain were recorded on the curtain.</p>

  <p>Gorman Gao didn't know the exact calculation method to calculate someone's strength, but in theory, it should have been based on the reference base of an early-stage Illuminating Soul Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this measurement method wasn't particularly accurate, but it could easily be used as a reference.</p>

  <p>With a single attack, Gorman Gao could achieve an effect three times as much as that of an early-stage Illuminating Soul Realm warrior. In other words, his one attack was equal to three times the strength of such a basic reference warrior.</p>

  <p>However, this kind of result was not a good one. In any case, he wanted to figure out just how powerful the attacking strength of the warrior who had left such a terrifying mark was.</p>
