  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng punched the two palm-sized skulls twice!</p>

  <p>However, he didn't put those small skulls in his eyes. His hands barely felt any pain when he punched the skulls since he used just a fraction of his strength!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought that it was enough to shatter them.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that the skulls wouldn't shatter. He was shocked to see that they only flew away.</p>

  <p>They were catapulted a few hundred meters away and even passed through two giant skulls. What was more shocking was they circled back with open mouths, aiming to bite Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>These small skulls? They were quite unusual!</p>

  <p>"Gira...</p>

  <p>Gira..."</p>

  <p>In addition, Luo Luo Zheng heard more curses that came from the surrounding giant skulls at the same time.</p>

  <p>Black vortexes then surrounded Luo Luo Zheng like a blanket of smoke as small skulls arose from them.</p>

  <p>"They really can't be broken?" Luo Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>He crushed the figure on the ground, then grabbed a small skull with a wave of his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng had used the power of ten thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>A surging force flowed through Luo Zheng's right arm and into his five fingers.</p>

  <p>This turbulent force enabled him to even twist a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>This small skull was like a solid boulder as it withstood Luo Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still unable to crush it even he had used such a strong power.</p>

  <p>20, 000 dragon scales!</p>

  <p>30, 000 dragon scales!</p>

  <p>It was such a small skull but Luo Luo Zheng had already exhausted almost all his strength. He had even used the power of the dragon scales to make all the forceful energy in his body erupt.</p>

  <p>Yet, the small skull still didn't crack at all!</p>

  <p>To make things worse, the other small skulls also rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng at the same time to bite him.</p>

  <p>"Ke! Ke! Ke!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly spun and kicked away all the skulls. Then, he suddenly moved in a flash in an attempt to kill the beings hidden inside the enormous skulls first.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>One by one, Luo Luo Zheng broke through the giant skulls.</p>

  <p>Luckily, it wasn't hard to deal with the ragged creatures in black cloaks.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to escape from Luo Luo Zheng while he used his full strength.</p>

  <p>His body was like a snake that slithered along the treetop. He destroyed and killed the giant skulls and creatures one by one.</p>

  <p>After a while, Luo Luo Zheng noticed that he increasingly got closer to the top of the tree.</p>

  <p>He finally realized that if he wanted to leave this maze, he'd have to destroy it.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had come up with a solution to the problem and it wasn't difficult for him to get close to the purple light, a new problem arose.</p>

  <p>What should he do with these small skulls?</p>

  <p>He originally thought the small skulls which were summoned by the strange creatures would disappear after he had killed those creatures.</p>

  <p>However, he hadn't seen even a single skull vanish even if he had already killed more than half of those creatures. In fact, the smalls skulls that followed Luo Luo Zheng from behind even increased in number, and he couldn't fend them off.</p>

  <p>It could be said that there was no connection between killing the creatures and the small skulls.</p>

  <p>One hour had passed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had crushed all the big skulls on the treetop within that timeframe.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng had also eliminated those from the Shadow Race!</p>

  <p>However, there were four to five hundred more palm-sized skulls that floated behind Luo Luo Zheng. The densely crowded skulls took turns to bite Luo Zheng's body, which made his skin crawl.</p>

  <p>"Scram!"</p>

  <p>A resounding force surged from Luo Zheng's body!</p>

  <p>It struck the densely packed skulls behind him and sent them flying in different directions.</p>

  <p>Then, something strange happened: after a short while, they moved towards Luo Luo Zheng and continued to bite him again!</p>

  <p>The skulls' bites weren't that strong, and since Luo Zheng's body was a divine weapon, he didn't feel much of them.</p>

  <p>But if he couldn't get rid of these skulls, wouldn't they always be behind him?</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly remembered something.</p>

  <p>Back when he had been captured by a Supreme Lord in the Middle Sky Region, there was a Supreme Lord who had been followed by countless skulls. Those skulls also ceaselessly bit at that Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>That Supreme Lord must have killed the people of the Shadow Race as well, which was why those skulls followed him.</p>

  <p>If even a Supreme Lord couldn't do anything to these skulls, then Luo Luo Zheng would be even more helpless.</p>

  <p>Then again, that Supreme Lord had killed those creatures in the universe, and Luo Luo Zheng was still in the Illusion Battlefield. Still, it was unseemly to be carrying so many skulls around the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hesitated for a while, then simply shook his head. Whatever. He could only take one step at a time anyway. At most, the skulls would be considered as a "shell" on his back. They were so hard, maybe they would be helpful in resisting some attacks.</p>

  <p>Without further thinking, Luo Luo Zheng walked towards the purple light.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng broke through the maze, he was only about two thousand feet away from the violet light. There was a flight of stairs made from tree branches in front of him. These steps rose into the air and extended all the way to the top of the Sacred Ailanthus.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng stepped onto the stairs, a giant eye in the sky blinked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smelled a strange fragrance, then the surrounding fog turned from a leaden gray to a light yellow.</p>

  <p>"Poison fog?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>The two most powerful methods of the sorcerer race were poisoning and incantation.</p>

  <p>The incantation indeed gave Luo Luo Zheng a headache. The small skulls which hung on his back and continuously ground their teeth was an example.</p>

  <p>He had no solution for that at all.</p>

  <p>As for the poisoning, though?</p>

  <p>He completely ignored it.</p>

  <p>The yellow poisonous fog around him was actually the ancient sorcerer race's long-lost Datura Poison.</p>

  <p>The method to make this poison had been lost for quite a long time.</p>

  <p>However, there were some records that stated how fatal the poison was.</p>

  <p>Normal warriors couldn't resist it, and even some of the world lords would be horrified at the mere mention of it. This poison had killed countless warriors when the ancient sorcerer race expanded.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how domineering the poison was, it was useless against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was just a weapon, but a weapon that looked like a human?</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng walked forward another 100 feet, another giant eye blinked and the yellow mist dissipated. What filled the air next was a blue poisonous fog.</p>

  <p>This time however, Luo Luo Zheng frowned at the sight of the blue fog.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because he was afraid of the poison, but because the blue fog was too unpleasant.</p>

  <p>The yellow poisonous gas was extremely fragrant. Meanwhile, the blue poisonous gas smelled extremely pungent, and assaulted his senses with its putrid scent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only cover his nose as he continued forward.</p>

  <p>Then the poisonous fog changed again every time Luo Luo Zheng had passed 100 feet. All of them also smelled different, but most of them were quite foul-smelling, like the stench of rotten fish. All the smells except for the first poisonous fog made Luo Luo Zheng feel really uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>If those supreme masters of the ancient sorcerer race had discovered that Luo Luo Zheng judged their Thirteen Deadly Poisons as such, they would probably be so angry that they'd vomit blood.</p>

  <p>These Thirteen Deadly Poisons were the proud invention of the ancient sorcerer race, and each of them had a different virulence. Some poisons could cause one's entire body to fester and die, while others would hide in the body of a martial artist for several years before erupting--then once they exploded, there would be nothing left of their victims. The poisons could even devour their victim's body.</p>

  <p>However, it would be a reckless waste for them to use these poisons to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The steps were covered in all sorts of poisonous fog. It might be a natural moat for ordinary warriors, which they couldn't pass through at all.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng passed through them with ease and finally arrived in front of the ball of purple light!</p>

  <p>The ball of purple light floated in the air like a bluish wave. Luo Luo Zheng observed it, and his face turned sour with disappointment.</p>

  <p>"If there are no fruits, and no Illusion Points, then what is this?"</p>

  <p>Then, he saw a rectangular iron ticket which floated in the middle of the purple ball of light.</p>

  <p>He reached out into the ball and grabbed at the rectangular iron ticket.</p>

  <p>Curiosity flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze froze when he grabbed the iron ticket and saw three words on it--"Hall of Causality".</p>

  <p>At that same moment, the iron ticket had conveyed a thought to him.</p>

  <p>"You can enter the Hall of Causality after paying five million Illusion Points. A total of ten warriors is required to open the hall, and three more are needed. Would you like to pay the Illusion Points?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned at the words from the voice that echoed in his head!</p>

  <p>"I've painstakingly roamed the top of this tree for so long, it's even fine if you don't give me Illusion Points--but now I'm actually supposed to pay five million Illusion Points?" Luo Luo Zheng said. Torn with his feelings, he had no idea whether to laugh or cry.</p>
