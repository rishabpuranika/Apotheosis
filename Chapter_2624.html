<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2624 The Superior's Strategy </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>People in higher positions were, generally speaking, usually more apathetic.</p>

  <p>Despite that, it didn't go to say that such warriors were cruel and bloodthirsty individuals, but compelled by certain circumstances, they were obliged to make important decisions.</p>

  <p>Emily had never been considered ruthless or barbaric, but right now, she didn't hesitate in the least.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>She suddenly and forcefully pointed at the crowd.</p>

  <p>Not far ahead of her, a beam of colorful light had begun to make its appearance. As it became brighter and brighter, the colorful light resembled a colorful little snake, slithering in the air. Its head slowly began chasing its tail, until it was connected end to end, forming a ring.</p>

  <p>The beam of light gained speed until it was spinning extremely fast. As it spun at the highest of speeds, it emitted a horrifying aura.</p>

  <p>A few Wild Gods halted and froze as they felt the horrifying aura creep over them, fear etched on their faces.</p>

  <p>"What kind of method is that? I'm afraid it's even more powerful than the Light of Adjudication itself!"</p>

  <p>"If someone were to be strangled by the ring of light, they would definitely die!"</p>

  <p>Before long, these fearful voices were drowned out by others who were more confident in their words.</p>

  <p>"We have so many warriors here. She might not even dare kill us!"</p>

  <p>"You're right. She can't kill us all, that's for sure."</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. Let's charge together at once!"</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods' eyes had turned red with emotion. They knew very well that their only chance of survival was entering the bone tower. The desire and will to live had already completely suppressed the fear they felt in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>One after the next, the Wild Gods rushed forward without stopping. On the contrary, they picked up as much speed as they possibly could.</p>

  <p>"I don't dare kill anyone?" A faint smile could be seen on Emily's face.</p>

  <p>Her right hand made a grab at the ring of light and then gave a slight twist.</p>

  <p>Crash, crash...</p>

  <p>In an instant, the ring of light suddenly began to emit a forceful suction.</p>

  <p>So much so, in fact, that the suction was too strong to resist.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter anymore whether the Wild Gods were several thousand feet high, or even tens of thousands of feet, they only felt a terrifying suction take over them. Even when unleashing their strongest power, they still couldn't manage to break free. They felt themselves gradually being absorbed by the suction and they couldn't help it in the least.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>Once the Wild Gods, who were as tall as mountains, had been sucked into the ring of light, their previously intact bodies were shattered into pieces in the blink of an eye. They didn't even have the time to scream before dying, and if they did utter a heartrending cry, their voices were all sucked in by the ring.</p>

  <p>"How terrifyingly horrible!"</p>

  <p>"Let's leave! Go! Hurry the hell up..."</p>

  <p>"What a cruel, disgusting method! She really does intend to kill every single one of us!"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't want to give up! I..."</p>

  <p>When the Wild Gods ahead saw what was going on, they began speaking to one another, turning pale with regret. But it was already too late.</p>

  <p>For the Wild Gods trailing behind, there remained a glimmer of hope in their hearts. They kept running forward. They didn't know that this path led directly to death.</p>

  <p>From afar, the huge ring of light could be described as a death god, repeatedly cutting off the Wild Gods' lives. The Wild Gods were all acting like terrified moths, darting into the flames. The moment they had decided to storm the Torrent Bone Tower, their fate had already been determined.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Snake Goddess race just stood there, motionlessly.</p>

  <p>Even their expressions appeared frozen in place.</p>

  <p>Although these warriors could only blame themselves for storming the Torrent Bone Tower, they were still living under the Snake Goddess race's control. They therefore had several connection with the sects belonging to this race.</p>

  <p>Now, their leader, Emily, had made a move. They knew she would slaughter a million, or ten million Wild Gods. Their hearts were, without a doubt, very heavy.</p>

  <p>In spite of how they were feeling, they also knew that their leader had no other choice. At this juncture, the slightest mercy toward these people was in turn, being cruel to themselves as well as the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of miles away from the Torrent Bone Tower, Roy was hiding beneath a sand, covered by a light brown cloth. The cloth could restrain his breath completely.</p>

  <p>The exiles' senses were just too powerful. Even though he was far away from them, he knew that he had to be very cautious.</p>

  <p>"It's unbelievable that she's trying to kill them all. What a bold and resolute woman, I must say!" Staring at the huge ring, Roy couldn't help the expression of fear on his face. It seemed that their Yellow Emperor race's plan would fall through. He wondered what the exiles of his race thought of the current situation.</p>

  <p>On the mountain located in the Yellow Emperor race's Pyramid Bone Tower, several exiles stood in the air, while Spark, who was dressed in black, sat at its peak.</p>

  <p>"Emily is so brutal... Does she really intend on killing everyone down there?" asked one of the Yellow Emperor race's exiles, with a melancholic expression.</p>

  <p>At first, the exiles had believed that their actions would work. At the very least, they had succeeded in instigating a ton of Wild Gods to attack the Torrent Bone Tower. Now though, their efforts seemed more like an egg smashing stone, having no effect whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Spark smiled casually and said, "Don't worry. She won't kill everyone."</p>

  <p>"And why is that, Spark? How do you know such a thing?" asked another exile.</p>

  <p>Spark held two black beads in his hand. The bead's surface was smooth and shiny. If one looked at it carefully, it was like staring into a living creature's pupil. When the two beads were rolling in his hand, Spark replied, "Just put yourself in her shoes. As a leader of the Snake Goddess race, Emily would come off as too cruel if she slaughtered millions of people. In order to balance her image among her race, what do you think she'll have to do?"</p>

  <p>One of the exiles thought for a moment and then said, "She'll spare the lives of a few Wild Gods and even save their lives."</p>

  <p>Spark agreed flatly, "Yes, she won't kill all of the Wild Gods, but will instead save a few of them in order to demonstrate her kindness. It's the superior's strategy."</p>

  <p>Several of the other surrounding exiles were suddenly enlightened by his explanation.</p>

  <p>"In other words, if I understand correctly, we should arrange our assassins within the last batch of the Wild Gods. Is that right?" another exile asked.</p>

  <p>"Correct," Spark nodded.</p>

  <p>"But even if our assassins succeed in entering the Torrent Bone Tower, they still won't have the chance to make a move." An exile expressed his worry as he frowned at the others.</p>

  <p>Even if the Snake Goddess race brought a few of the Wild Gods to the bone tower, she would order her people to watch over them like hawks.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible for the assassins hiding within the group to escape, nor would they have the chance to kill the siblings. It was difficult to even find them.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," agreed Spark with a calm look on his face.</p>

  <p>"Then tell us, Spark, what's your real purpose?"</p>

  <p>These exiles were quickly confused by Spark's words. In their eyes, what Spark planned was useless. However, as smart as he was, they knew he would never do such a thing as waste his time.</p>

  <p>"Just watch for yourself, and you'll see," said Spark, a confident expression taking over his handsome face.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>The ring of light summoned by Emily had, up to this point, successfully killed more than nine million Wild Gods at the foot of the Torrent Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>These Wild Gods didn't even leave their corpses. Instead, they were immediately ground into dust and disappeared from this world.</p>

  <p>At last, when there were about twenty or thirty thousand Wild Gods remaining outside the bone tower, the ring of light, which symbolized death, finally stopped rotating.</p>
