<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ground shook as the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe charged forth like a pack of wolves.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng and the others joined in the fight every time the four swords broke through the golden circle of light.</p>

  <p>It only took them less than a few seconds to kill several Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, the most of the people present quietly retreated when the little golden monkey appeared.</p>

  <p>They continued to repeat their attacks until Supreme Lord Denzel was exhausted, to the point that his resistance became useless.</p>

  <p>He was frozen like a statue amidst the battlefield as he watched his comrades die and everything fall around him.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the number of Supreme Lords who surrounded the altar began to dwindle� out of twenty-odd, only three had remained.</p>

  <p>"I don't expect to die here! This war was already unfair to begin with anyway! You only rely on that True God!" Supreme Lord Denzel roared in despair.</p>

  <p>His desperate cries echoed across the Sunflower Water World. Then again, what else could he do?</p>

  <p>If Wynn hadn't used the Star Sealing Technique to seal their space, the over fifty Supreme Lords wouldn't have been defeated so miserably.</p>

  <p>Alas, the Sacred Supreme Lords who were imprisoned in the Sunflower Water World ran around in panic, but they were nothing more than moving targets.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard Supreme Lord Denzel's words, he appeared silently in front of the altar once again. At the same time, Supreme Lord of Oracle and Xun who held on to the Saint Killing Spear had also emerged from the space cracks. Soon enough, the area was filled with numerous Supreme Lords from the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"You are so shameless to make such remarks. Your Sacred race has invaded our Evolutionary Universe, and it is unfair to us to begin with," said Supreme Lord of Original Sin. Maha had already killed Nathan, and he would never forget that. He clearly hated the Sacred race with every fiber of his being.</p>

  <p>"That's right. If you're not one of us, then you're evil. Do you even want to fight us on the battle ring?" Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment sneered. It was known that the wars that broke out between the different races were more than violent and vicious.</p>

  <p>Before the Sacred race had even invaded, the human race, the Demon Night race, and the ogre race were already in a never-ending feud.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they could never reconcile due to their numerous conflicts.</p>

  <p>It was ironic because all those three races came from the Evolutionary Universe. But now, they were suddenly united against the alien-like Sacred race. After all, the Sacred race came from another universe that was completely foreign to them.</p>

  <p>In any case, all the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe thought that as long as they could preserve their universe, nothing was too taboo in their methods.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel's gaze drifted to everyone as a deep smile appeared on his despairing face. "There is indeed no fairness. If we die here, you all have to die with us. How could a mere Evolutionary Universe escape from the clutches of our Sacred race?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel believed that the Grand Supreme Lord would avenge him. In reality, he couldn't see nor feel the vengeance, which was why he resorted to making sarcastic remarks.</p>

  <p>However, even his threatening words had no effect. More and more Supreme Lords from the Evolutionary Universe descended down, and all of them simply looked at him without any emotions.</p>

  <p>"Have you finished talking nonsense?" Supreme Lord of Oracle asked flatly. A faint, purple light shone in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Hah... You don't have to do anything!" Supreme Lord Denzel shot back.</p>

  <p>After he waved his hand, his cinnabar field suddenly caved in. A burst of power began to condense inside of it, and then the other two Supreme Lords also did the same.</p>

  <p>"Boom!" "Boom!" "Boom!"</p>

  <p>It turned out that the three Supreme Lords used the last strand of their life vitality to detonate themselves.</p>

  <p>The strength of a Supreme Lord was enough to make the process of self-detonation more than terrifying. But since the three of them had already used up their energy, their self-detonation was no longer deadly to everyone present.</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lord Denzel exploded, the altar also slowly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Even the little golden monkey on top of the altar could only give a creak as it glared at the crowd. Then, it unwillingly disappeared in front of everyone's eyes as well.</p>

  <p>When a Supreme Lord died, their Heavenly Destiny would not disappear.</p>

  <p>Instead, it would return to the heavens in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>This war was the first battle between the Evolutionary Universe and the Murphy Universe. After several years of tolerance, the members of the Evolutionary Universe suddenly launched an attack which quickly killed a third of the Sacred Supreme Lords. The entire process went by without a hitch; only two Supreme Lords of Evolutionary Universe had died, and the head of the Celestial Position race hadn't even done anything.</p>

  <p>However, worry still lingered in everyone's minds. After all, the true opponent was still in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred race opened up the passage to the Sighing Wall, the Evolutionary Universe would have to face the furious retaliation from the Sacred race. No one talked about it, but it pressured them immensely.</p>

  <p>The war among Supreme Lords had already destroyed the Sunflower Water World into pieces, and not even a Supreme Lord could fix it.</p>

  <p>However, the universe originally had the ability to heal itself, and the Sunflower Water World would heal eventually. The only thing was that it was ultimately impossible for it to be fully complete again. It could only be revived as a broken supreme world, like the Orange Sea World.</p>

  <p>Then again, it was the best result that they could hope for. The Orange Sea World had been utterly wrecked when a few Supreme Lords had fought. This time, over a hundred Supreme Lords had battled in the Sunflower Water World and if Wynn hadn't captured the Sacred Supreme Lords, then more than one Sunflower Water World or even thousands of other supreme worlds would have been destroyed as well.</p>

  <p>In addition, there were still a great number of Sacred martial artists in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, without the support of the Supreme Lords, these Sacred martial artists wouldn't be able to live long in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>All sorts of talents could kill the Sacred martial artists, and it was just that they still needed some time.</p>

  <p>Despite that, they should think about how to deal with the Sacred race's future counterattack first.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, Wynn appeared in front of everyone once again with a bitter smile on his face. "The Sacred race has begun to break through the boundary," he whispered.</p>

  <p>The Sighing Wall was extremely strong and was well fortified. It was immensely difficult to break through it.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had started to tear through it hundreds of years ago, but if it wasn't for Murphy's assistance, they would've needed several hundred more years.</p>

  <p>Wynn just used a Dark Star and the Star Sealing Technique to seal the passageway. As a True God, he was indeed powerful and could employ such an extremely remarkable method, but his method was not an invincible obstacle.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race and many other Supreme Lords under his command stood in front of the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>All of them looked positively devastated.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the quaking of the heavens continued for a long time. After all, all of the Sacred Supreme Lords who were headed for the Evolutionary Universe had already died without a single one surviving!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race had many sects that were also in conflict with one another, but as Supreme Lords of the same race, they were actually very close to each other. Thus, to say that the remaining living Supreme Lords of the Sacred race were crushed upon hearing about the death of their comrades was an understatement.</p>

  <p>Just then, a young man in black floated in front of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be fairly gentle, but his Mu Ning left a deep impression on them. Such an Mu Ning was actually a momentum, and the young man in black was one of Murphy's disciples� Pranav.</p>

  <p>All of Pranav's inheritances came from Murphy, so his momentum was very similar to that of the Grand Supreme Lord's Heavens-suppressing Object. However, there were still some differences between the two.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. It's just a seal formed with the help of the power of the stars. It's just a mediocre skill!" Pranav declared. A small smile appeared on his face as he looked at the blocked passageway.</p>

  <p>"Master Pranav, can you make a move right now? Our Sacred race..."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Russell said anxiously. His son and daughter had both joined the expedition team, so it was unknown if they had survived at the moment.</p>

  <p>However, Pranav simply glared at him. "There's no need to rush!" he hissed.</p>

  <p>"Russell, do not disrespect Master Pranav like that!" the Grand Supreme Lord scolded. "But..."</p>

  <p>In the end, Supreme Lord Russell could only keep quiet with a despaired look on his face. The Sacred warriors worked themselves to death for Murphy. As Murphy was the ruler of their entire universe, the Sacred race didn't have the qualifications to reject any of Murphy's requests.</p>

  <p>However, that didn't mean that the Sacred race didn't have any opinions or complaints.</p>

  <p>While they had to help Murphy disintegrate the entire Evolutionary Universe, what good would that actually do to the Sacred race?</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords overworked themselves to the bone for Murphy, but Pranav, as Murphy's disciple, didn't seem to care about it at all. It was no surprise that the Supreme Lords who were with him secretly had a mountain of complaints to say.</p>

  <p>It was useless because Pranav just didn't care. The divine land's creatures thought that the secondary creatures in the universes couldn't be considered real living beings. To them, secondary creatures were nothing more than objects that were formed from life vitality. Thus, they didn't care how many secondary creatures died.</p>

  <p>Pranav leapt lightly and entered the passageway of the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>Then, a light yellow beam of light shot out from the passageway. The light beam was reflected from the passageway and went straight towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Right after that, the Supreme Lords heard Pranav shout, "Break!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound, and then a stream of air was sucked in. The passageway that connected the two universes was opened once again.</p>
