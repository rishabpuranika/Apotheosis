<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The light from the sun-like object glowed for an hour...</p>

  <p>As the light faded away, Zheng's round belly also gradually returned to normal.</p>

  <p>However, the pill was still in Zheng's stomach. Just as Zheng wondered about what the ancestry-level bloodline would do with the pill, the pill suddenly melted into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly felt like there were thousands of needles wandering about his meridians at lightning speed. The pain made Zheng's face darken. It was so excruciating that he couldn't help but let out a low growl.</p>

  <p>The pain gradually dissipated when the pill completely fused into Zheng's body, but at the same time, Zheng also obtained a strange body!</p>

  <p>The skin covering his body had turned blue and translucent. His muscles, blood vessels, and even bones had turned into some kind of extremely solid crystals. Among all, the color of his bones was the darkest, while the color of his muscles was the second darkest...</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his hand and examined it carefully. His dark blue fingernails were shining, and there was a strong, heavy force circulating around his limbs and bones...</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling now?" asked Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"Good— it feels like I've opened up a new world," Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you can defeat Hawley?" the Snake Goddess could not help but ask. This was the most crucial issue after all.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>The theurgy and the power the ancestry-level bloodline gave to Zheng were extremely unstable. Although they were very strong, it was difficult for Zheng to gauge how strong they were, so he naturally could not be sure about whether or not he could defeat Hawley.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, considering the nature of the ancestry-level bloodline which could practically construct everything, in case it intended to let Zheng defeat an opponent, it would definitely provide him with enough strength to do so.</p>

  <p>"Then… shall we go back to the Other Shore now?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, let's go!"</p>

  <p>Zheng replied affirmatively and then landed on the ruins of the palace. He then summoned the Truth of Godly Way and returned directly to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan were all people who had experienced many battles. They all returned to the Other Shore with Zheng without any hesitation in the slightest.</p>

  <p>In the Flaming Maple Forest, Hawley was still standing there like an iron tower, staring ahead motionlessly.</p>

  <p>The members of the various races, as well as the Eternal Realm warriors waiting under the Flaming Maple Trees in the distance, were all whispering among themselves…</p>

  <p>"Almost four hours have passed!"</p>

  <p>"They're courting death if they come back. Those humans aren't stupid."</p>

  <p>"It's just a waste of time to wait like this..."</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Larkin stepped forward and scolded.</p>

  <p>Although Larkin also felt that it was impossible for Zheng and his companions to come back, he still had to uphold Hawley's prestige and stop these people from gossiping.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Misty River race were still waiting alongside Hawley. All of them looked solemn.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a huge creature suddenly appeared not far from Hawley.</p>

  <p>Compared to his state before he withdrew from the Other Shore, it was obvious from his current state that Zheng had undergone a great change. The huge, translucent, blue crystal figure was completely different from how Zheng looked like before.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" Hawley asked.</p>

  <p>He remembered Zheng's aura, so he immediately recognized that this huge creature was the human boy just now. He did not make any comment about it, but he was, in fact, also a little baffled to see the mystical changes that had occurred in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You've wasted my time, and that makes you more sinful. Then... you can go to hell now!"</p>

  <p>As Hawley spoke, his huge fist was already swung towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out his crystal-like right hand, and the two huge forces soon collided with a sharp clang.</p>

  <p>The ground under Zheng's feet instantly sank, and almost half of his body was forced into the ground. Nevertheless, he managed to withstand Hawley's attack!</p>

  <p>"Blocked! He blocked it!"</p>

  <p>"This is the first time someone has managed to block Hawley's attack!"</p>

  <p>"Does that human really have such a strong body?"</p>

  <p>Previously, the fact that Zheng was still alive and kicking after taking the blow from Hawley had already shocked all the warriors present here.</p>

  <p>Now, he could block Hawley's attack right after he came back?</p>

  <p>In their astonishment, their eyes had grown as wide as saucers.</p>

  <p>This meant that Zheng had the power to fight against Hawley!</p>

  <p>A trace of amazement also flashed in Hawley's eyes. He began to fight seriously, flinging punch after punch towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom...</p>

  <p>Although his attack speed was not fast, his incessant attacks landed at a stable pace all along.</p>

  <p>Every time Zheng took a blow, he would be forced to take a step back. The ground under him was constantly shaking as if there was an earthquake.</p>

  <p>But there was something interesting in this whole situation— those Flaming Maple Trees remained firm on the ground. They were neither breaking nor collapsing despite the fact that the ground was quaking.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's body has become stronger again!" the Snake Goddess said astounded.</p>

  <p>"I really want to know— what kind of bloodline has he fused with that he can become so powerful in such a short time?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with a tone that was full of appreciation and curiosity.</p>

  <p>If they were to face Hawley, they probably could not withstand even one-tenth of the power in Hawley's punch.</p>

  <p>Zheng steadily retreated. His hands acted like two pieces of shields that blocked all Hawley's attacks.</p>

  <p>After blocking more than thirty punches in a row, Zheng had once again arrived in front of the three adjacent Flaming Maple Trees. This time, he did not choose to escape.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the moment Hawley threw out a punch, Zheng leaped back, and his legs stepped on the trunk of a Flaming Maple Tree. Using the tree trunk as his footing, he propelled his body forward and pounced straight on Hawley.</p>

  <p>Not only did he dodge Hawley's punch, but he even spread out his arms and used both of them to launch an even fiercer attack towards Hawley!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng had launched eight punches.</p>

  <p>Eight deep dents appeared on Hawley's broad chest, and eight huge fist marks protruded from his back.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng and Hawley were equally stunned!</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, receiving such powerful attacks, the attacked person would surely be thrown backward. As they flew back, they could offset a considerable amount of power that they received.</p>

  <p>Now, Hawley just stood motionless in his original spot. That meant he had forcefully taken the power of Zheng's eight punches!</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing under his feet that could anchor him to the ground. It ought to be impossible for him to stand still and continue to receive Zheng's attack head-on...</p>

  <p>Was this a special theurgy his body possessed?</p>

  <p>Zheng was baffled.</p>

  <p>"An impressive attack," Hawley praised after spitting out a mouthful of black blood.</p>

  <p>Hawley felt like there was another force that fixed him on the spot when Zheng threw his punches. He was just like a target that could not move.</p>

  <p>Despite Hawley's impressive strength, his body would inevitably be injured upon directly receiving those punches.</p>

  <p>Larkin, Wheeler, and the other members of the Misty River race were all watching this scene in horror.</p>

  <p>They almost could not believe their eyes. The undefeatable, almost invincible Hawley was actually being beaten by a human and got injured to the point he spat out blood!</p>

  <p>Right now, nothing could be more frightening than this in this world!</p>

  <p>The warriors from other races and the Eternal Realm warriors also gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>They were both shocked and ecstatic.</p>

  <p>It would be great news for them if this human kid could really kill Hawley!</p>

  <p>"How about taking a few more punches?"</p>

  <p>Zheng did not hesitate. With a slight shake of his body, fierce fist radiance was shot towards Hawley from all directions.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The punches created a series of dull thuds. If one looked carefully, they would see that after each punch hit Hawley, there was a slight tremor in his body. It was as if the space had been disrupted.</p>
