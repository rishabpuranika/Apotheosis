<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2345 Kill Him </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Golden Shell Turtles usually appeared in the most remote areas of the Everest Spirit Mountain. Because these beasts moved so slowly, very few True Gods ever came to attack them.</p>

  <p>In the Fang Clan, not many True Gods specialized in the Parting Water Divine Dao. Only four True Gods, including Yilia, had mastered this token beyond way called Parting Water Divine Mirror. And these few True Gods had never encountered the Golden Shell Turtles before.</p>

  <p>As for Shahn, on the other hand, he had killed Golden Shell Turtles in the Everest Spirit Mountain. That said, he didn't practice the Parting Water Divine Dao, and thus, had no idea that the Parting Water Divine Mirror could have such an effect when encountering a Golden Shell Turtle.</p>

  <p>The sixty-four Buddha Emperor Swords continued swaying next to Luo Zheng, several of which began showing signs of instability.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng didn't have a Purple Power Body. Although he had cultivated the Purple Aura Divine Dao, he couldn't completely master the Separate Controlling. For this reason, Joy had only taught him the token of controlling four swords.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had become a True God now, it was still difficult for him to control sixty-four Buddha Emperor Swords all at once!</p>

  <p>'Just combine together!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The sixty-four Buddha Emperor Swords merged together in haste and changed from sixty-four swords to four huge swords!</p>

  <p>'The strength... It's weakening so fast!' Luo Zheng thought, and his gaze suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>His strength weakened quickly as it escaped his body!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's Buddha Emperor Sword was completely expulsed from his body, its strength source needed continuous replenishment through the Cross-world token in order for the Buddha Emperor Sword's shape to be maintained. If he stopped replenishing the strength source, the Buddha Emperor Sword would collapse in a very short period of time.</p>

  <p>The strength source that formed the four huge swords didn't come from Luo Zheng, but was the duplicate created by the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>The four huge swords were too large and needed so much strength source. Luo Zheng's strength source was unable to maintain their shapes and the four huge swords were rapidly weakening, like the melting ice and snow, right in front of Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he shouted aloud.</p>

  <p>Before the four huge swords completely weakened, Luo Zheng controlled them and directed them to chop the four Golden Shell Turtles not too far off!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The four huge swords contained the power which was so astonishing that it was comparable to a strike coming from a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The four Golden Shell Turtles were instantly sliced in half!</p>

  <p>The four huge swords that belonged to Luo Zheng were rapidly weakening now.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the surface of the Golden Shell Turtles flashed a screen of white light once again and the four swords were thrust from them.</p>

  <p>"That's enough," Luo Zheng mumbled to himself faintly.</p>

  <p>Once he had successfully taken control of the four huge swords with the help of the Parting Water Divine Mirror, he had the chance to kill another four Golden Shell Turtles before the swords became even weaker!</p>

  <p>By doing so, Luo Zheng killed the Golden Shell Turtles in an efficient manner.</p>

  <p>Naylor, who was standing not far away from them, continued to swing his saber violently, killing off the Golden Shell Turtles one by one.</p>

  <p>However, he had to bear their counter-attack every time he killed a Golden Shell Turtle. Although he was strong enough to withstand such with his body, he fell speechless in awe when he saw Luo Zheng killing the Golden Shell Turtles with ease.</p>

  <p>Relying on his method, Luo Zheng's speed of killing the Golden Shell Turtles far exceeded that of the other consummate True Gods. Simultaneously, the strong blood energy poured into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"It's so hot!" Luo Zheng cried out.</p>

  <p>The raging power of blood energy rolled and boiled in Luo Zheng's body, unceasingly fulfilling every single muscle and piece of flesh he had.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's action inevitably attracted the attention of many consummate True Gods, as well as Rachelle's.</p>

  <p>Rachelle didn't kill the Golden Shell Turtles, though. Instead, she leaned against the tree stump and closed her eyes in order to try and catch a little rest. She didn't open her eyes again until she heard the conversation between Walton and Shahn. Her eyelids lifted and she stared at Luo Zheng indifferently.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Rachelle had told Nelly to pay close attention to Luo Zheng at all times.</p>

  <p>"Is this guy really the anonymous man from the Han Clan?" Rachelle asked through the use of her life vitality.</p>

  <p>As Rachelle watched Luo Zheng control the illusory swords, she felt more and more certain that Luo Zheng really was the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>Nelly nodded and replied, "Yes, he really is. It seems that his real name isn't Tianxing Luo. I overheard Liusu calling him Luo Zheng by accident when she was anxious, so I suspect that Tianxing Luo is just his assumed name."</p>

  <p>The person who had paid the most attention to Luo Zheng in the valley was perhaps Nelly. After all, it was a task that her sister had asked her to perform.</p>

  <p>"His surname is Luo, and his first name is Luo Zheng.  Luo Zheng Luo." Rachelle's expression appeared playful as she pondered over this name. She then said flatly, "A few days ago, I met our father. He mentioned the matter concerning the warriors who snuck into the divine land from the Evolutionary Universe. He told me that the second warrior entered the Vast Sky Region."</p>

  <p>"The Vast Sky Region is the Han Clan's territory," Nelly responded. In spite of her words, she still had no idea what Rachelle was trying to say.</p>

  <p>Rachelle twirled a strand of drooping hair with her index finger. The black, smooth hair circled a few times, forming a delicate spiral. She continued, "With the Han Clan's ability, it would have been impossible to train such a remarkable warrior in a short period of time. Besides, he's not a descendant of Han Clan but an outsider with the surname 'Luo'."</p>

  <p>Rachelle continued brushing her hair as she watched Luo Zheng off in the distance.</p>

  <p>As she listened to Rachelle, Nelly suddenly understood the meaning of her sister's words. "So you asked me to watch him not because you thought he's the anonymous man but because you suspected he was sent by Mike? That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>It wouldn't really change much if Luo Zheng was the anonymous man. On the other hand, however, the situation would be very different if Luo Zheng had been sent by Mike, or even if he was from the Evolutionary Universe. If that was the case, he'd quickly become the Mu Clan's sworn enemy and be eliminated.</p>

  <p>For some reason, Nelly suddenly felt a sense of panic take over her. She didn't want to believe her ears, and then she said, "Even though Luo Zheng is not a descendant of the Han Clan, it doesn't mean that he comes from the Evolutionary Universe. After all, there are many people with the surname Luo in the world. There's still a small chance that there could be a talent or two, like Luo Zheng, appearing from an unknown clan."</p>

  <p>Rachelle looked at Nelly with strange, doubtful gaze. "Father isn't completely sure, and neither am I. But there is another thing. Back in the Arena of Legends, Harold has unexpectedly said that except for the Moon Clan, the Sword Clan, the Han Clan and the Gu Clan, the other clans weren't even allowed to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain...</p>

  <p>According to our father's analysis, Harold must have known that someone had already arrived in the Han Clan, and thus sent such a message to this person. That is to say, he spoke those words only to ask the warrior to travel to the Everest Spirit Mountain's Cloud Dragon Ravine. Coincidentally, the Han Clan's anonymous man suddenly emerged. Do you still think this is a coincidence?</p>

  <p>There's at least an eighty percent possibility that the anonymous man was sent by Mike. Let's face it..." As she spoke, Rachelle glanced at Nelly indifferently and asked in confusion, "What are you so nervous about, anyway?"</p>

  <p>Nelly's heart skipped a beat. She shook her head at once and said,</p>

  <p>"You're right. His identity is suspicious, but we can't be completely sure that he belongs to Mike, either."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know me better than that?"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Rachelle stood up with a tight smile on her lips and said,</p>

  <p>"Mike is very powerful and crafty. He's good at laying out plans, and each of his chess pieces is of great use to him, and only him. But it's easy to break his plot. I'll kill each of his men one by one!"</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, Rachelle pulled out a short sword and looked at Luo Zheng, who was still killing the Golden Shell Turtles in the distance. "I'd rather kill him than let him go."</p>
