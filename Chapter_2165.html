<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The consciousness of Zheng's inner world was soon suppressed by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite having done so, the surging waves of consciousness continued to spread out, constantly reminding Luo Zheng that this item was more than just important.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was the creator of this world, this consciousness also belonged to Luo Zheng, and such waves simply couldn't resist him.</p>

  <p>In the past, while Master Evil was communicating with Luo Zheng, he had warned him that an inner world's consciousness wasn't necessarily entirely safe. If he was careless, such consciousness might even occupy his body.</p>

  <p>There had once been True Gods who had neglected to monitor and manage their own inner worlds. Within such inner worlds were born very ambitious secondary creatures. Through the method of controlling the Godly Tile, these creatures succeeded in destroying the True God's soul.</p>

  <p>Luckily enough for the True Gods, only the secondary creatures from a Holy Being's inner world could actually comprehend the Godly Way and eventually escape. Although the aforementioned secondary creatures obtained the bodies of those Gods of Creation through the Godly Tile, they remained confined within their inner worlds, without possibility of ever entering the divine land. In other words, these True Gods all became walking corpses.</p>

  <p>During the period of time that Zheng's cinnabar field had been sealed, a creature like these had equally appeared, Evil God. If Luo Zheng hadn't interfered, it was very likely that Evil God would have been able to do this to Luo Zheng, as well. After being suppressed by Luo Zheng though, Evil God became much quieter.</p>

  <p>Now that the entire inner world was suddenly so intrigued by the piece of "mud", there was no way Luo Zheng was going to ignore it.</p>

  <p>"Let me see," Luo Zheng replied calmly to the little girl. In his mind, he was wondering something completely different. "Don't you know that piece of mud?" he asked Master Evil in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Mud?" Master Evil was startled slightly before taking notice of the brown colored mud. He hesitated silently for a few seconds before muttering, "This mud seems to be familiar. It could be brown cloud mud, and it also appears to be ... No, no, no... That's..."</p>

  <p>In Zheng's eyes, Master Evil was an extremely knowledgeable person that had a very deep understanding of the divine land. After dawdling for a while, he finally provided an answer that made Luo Zheng feel faint, "That's an ordinary piece of mud."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was speechless. There had to be a reason why this mud was causing such agitation within his inner world. There was no way he would believe that it was only an ordinary piece of mud. His only option now was to ask the stall owner.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng carelessly zipped left and right in front of the stall. He focused his gaze on the said piece of mud and asked, "May I ask why this piece of mud is being sold here?"</p>

  <p>The little girl blinked her eyes a few times, covered her mouth and giggled. "This piece of mud is a treasure!" she said.</p>

  <p>"A treasure?" Luo Zheng felt disbelief and his face revealed a puzzled expression. If this piece of mud was such a treasure as she had said, then why did she throw it to the side so casually? Of course, Luo Zheng wasn't naive, and there was no way he was going to believe that, either.</p>

  <p>When the little girl noticed that Luo Zheng didn't believe her in the least, she continued in a clear, confident voice, "It's true. When we dug this piece of mud out twenty years ago, there was a towering tree growing atop it.</p>

  <p>That tree was way over one thousand feet tall and was about to pierce through the sky." The little girl gestured upward with her hand as she spoke.</p>

  <p>Scientifically speaking, it was impossible that the tree was about to pierce through the sky. The divine land's sky was unimaginably high, not to mention that a tree a thousand feet tall was not very high at all. In fact, there were countless trees that reached tens of thousands of feet in the air all across the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Still focusing on Zheng's expression, the little girl pursed her lips and said,</p>

  <p>"There are golden apricot trees planted on the hillside. It's already impressive when an ordinary golden apricot tree grows to a height of twenty or thirty feet, but the golden apricot trees on that hillside are all extremely tall. Many people have said over the years that there must be something spiritual at the bottom of the hill, so our Tie Clan sent people to dig it out. We didn't expect this piece of mud to pop out after we had spent so much time there digging. At the time, this piece of mud even took on a human form and attempted an escape; it was extremely fast!</p>

  <p>Luckily, my uncle Alfred was there and he caught the mud before it could go anywhere."</p>

  <p>The Tie Clan was a small clan in the Six-Burden Region. They were much stronger than the Misty Mountain Village, but despite that, they still weren't strong enough to be considered among the third-tier clans.</p>

  <p>"Human form? Escape? This mud must really have spirituality then,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement, somewhat surprised.</p>

  <p>"That's right! And my uncle was so happy and pretty proud, too," the little girl added as she laughed. "But I guess after being bound by my uncle, this piece of mud seemed to have lost its spirituality, and later on, it became like this�"</p>

  <p>As it turned out, after the Tie Clan had obtained this piece of mud and controlled it, they had self-proclaimed it to be an incredible treasure.</p>

  <p>Throughout all the divine land, many spiritual objects existed. Time here was endless and as a result, bizarre things would appear every now and again. Time could give many things a spiritual sense, but a piece of mud that had spirituality was extremely rare, to say the least.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the piece of mud, the Tie Clan had secretly and carefully studied it for a long time. Despite having been doing so, they couldn't find anything special about the said piece of mud. It literally was just as Master Evil had said� an absolutely ordinary piece of mud.</p>
