<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was obvious that a power separated the mist, almost straight down the middle, providing them with a path.</p>

  <p>The path that had appeared out of the blue was abnormal, however.</p>

  <p>When the crowd saw this scene, their eyes flashed with reason.</p>

  <p>Reinhard, a warrior from the Sword Clan, was clearly the most familiar with the debate venue.</p>

  <p>But he never heard that there was such a path in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>"Is this a trap?" Reinhard asked, wanting to proceed cautiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng just shrugged his shoulders carelessly and walked forward with his sister by his side.</p>

  <p>One way or another, it was useless overthinking things. They simply had no other choice.</p>

  <p>Reinhard watched their receding figures for a moment with a bitter smile plastered on his face. It appeared as though Zheng and Yan didn't have any psychological burden whatsoever.</p>

  <p>"Reinhard, are we really going in there, too?" Solomon asked, worriedly.</p>

  <p>Reinhard only nodded firmly and led the Sword Clan disciples forward at a brisk pace.</p>

  <p>As for the True Gods of humble origins, as well as the members of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, they also chose to catch up, although they had hesitated for a good while.</p>

  <p>Because there was no longer any mist obstructing their view, everything in front of them became clear as day. They could see very far off into the distance, without anything blocking the way.</p>

  <p>After about 20 miles of marching, deep marks began to appear on the ground. These marks seemed to outline strange arrays in certain shapes.</p>

  <p>"These arrays... These arrays are very similar to those where the avatars were summoned! Don't you think?" Reinhard was amazed and excited as he spoke.</p>

  <p>He quickly jumped into an array in an attempt to activate it.</p>

  <p>However, the array didn't respond, not in the least.</p>

  <p>"Why isn't it activating?" Reinhard questioned aloud, now feeling quite confused.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a careful look at these marks which continued spreading far off into the distance. So much so, in fact, that Zheng couldn't see where they ended.</p>

  <p>"Maybe these marks are different from what we imagine." Zheng offered his hypothesis lightly, moving briskly along the marks that extended endlessly.</p>

  <p>Reinhard glanced over at Solomon and ordered, "Plant the Eye of Perception. Do it now!"</p>

  <p>There was necessary information that needed to be seen by the Sword Clan leaders.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing the strange marks as well, the other True Gods revealed an expectant look as they picked up their pace in order to catch up with Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>As for Duke and the rest, they looked at one another and unanimously chose to follow the group, too.</p>

  <p>Unwittingly, Zheng seemed to have led them to an unusual, outlandish place.</p>

  <p>The marks on the ground continued to spread until they reached the very end.</p>

  <p>"Look! Over here! There's a stone tablet!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with excitement as he saw the towering cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>What was more, on the cyan stone tablet, a circle of strange Sanskrit words were neatly drawn.</p>

  <p>"What unique Sanskrit words!"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to copy them!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The True Gods who could participate in the debate had studied plenty of Sanskrit words in their time.</p>

  <p>As they indulged in their discovery of such unique Sanskrit words in this place, they felt as though they had just fallen upon the greatest of treasures. How could any of them be willing to bypass this opportunity?</p>

  <p>Even Zheng had taken out a few of his duplicating stone tablets from his space ring that he'd received in the Famous Sword Divine City. He, too, began to copy the Sanskrit words on the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>While everyone was busy copying the Sanskrit words in a haste, Yan was the only one who appeared bored, and certainly, with nothing to do.</p>

  <p>She walked directly over to the stone tablet and looked upward. A faint smile appeared on her face. "Zheng, come and have a look at this!"</p>

  <p>Zheng activated the duplicating stone tablets in his hand and aimed them at the Sanskrit words. It wasn't before long that the duplicating stone tablets began to display the same Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>As he heard Yan call out to him, he responded and reluctantly walked over to her.</p>

  <p>Looking up in the direction Yan was pointing, Zheng was suddenly shocked to his very core. "This..." he uttered.</p>

  <p>It turned out that behind the huge stone tablet were carved a series of large, impressive words.</p>

  <p>The words were vigorous and elegant, of course, but they equally contained the Non-combat Zone's special aura.</p>

  <p>"If you want my inheritance, please leave your name on the top of the stone tablet. The most outstanding warrior will be the winner!"</p>

  <p>This wasn't necessarily the golden opportunity Zheng had been looking, nor hoping for.</p>

  <p>He'd imagined that the Other Shore Realm powerhouse's inheritance had to be located at the end of the debate venue.</p>

  <p>At least, this was what the Holy Beings were led to believe at the time.</p>

  <p>For this reason, it took them a great deal of energy to get through the debate venue. At last, they were stopped by the iron bridge.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning to the very end, they hadn't received anything.</p>

  <p>Absolutely nothing.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on his behalf, had also been misled.</p>

  <p>At first, he also figured that the end of the debate venue was this trip's main objective.</p>

  <p>However, on the way, Zheng found that the setup of the debate venue was much too unreasonable. Thus, he proceeded without a plan in an attempt to find other golden opportunities. Perhaps this place could provide him with even more powerful weapons.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to him though, that a path would suddenly appear in the mist, guiding them straight to this place.</p>

  <p>The more he took the time to observe this location, the more he realized that they were probably standing right in the middle of the Other Shore Realm powerhouse's inheritance place.</p>

  <p>It was simply unbelievable! Zheng felt astonished in every way.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng didn't know that five minutes ago, a wedge-shaped space had appeared in front of the skeleton in the deep well. The skeleton gently drew a line in the air with his white, bony finger. Only when the skeleton performed this action did Zheng see the path without the mist.</p>

  <p>In other words, the mist covering the path had originally been created by the skeleton who equally controlled it.</p>

  <p>While a few of the True Gods were still busy copying the Sanskrit words, the others had taken notice of Zheng's excited expression. They all quickly bypassed the stone tablet and looked upward, too.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Reinhard saw the words and he exclaimed, "This... This is..."</p>

  <p>Reinhard couldn't believe his own eyes at the very sight of these words.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to him, either. After having endured such difficult times, was it really possible that they had fallen upon the inheritance in such an easy, effortless manner? He couldn't believe it. In fact, no one could.</p>

  <p>After seeing the stone tablet, Solomon immediately planted the Eye of Perception.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Sword Divine City, Harold and Marsh watched remotely and were also filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the inheritance at the end of the debate venue? I don't understand what's going on there!"</p>

  <p>Although Marsh had tried his best to cross the iron bridge in his turn, he had ultimately failed.</p>

  <p>It was in this very moment that he realized he might have been going in the wrong direction the entire time.</p>

  <p>However, Harold shook his head and answered, "That's not necessarily true. Perhaps the ship's captain doesn't want any other men to obtain the inheritance. Have you thought of that?"</p>

  <p>Taking the mist that had disappeared into consideration, it wasn't difficult to have come to such a conclusion.</p>

  <p>As he was reminded of the latter, Marsh only nodded. That said, an incredulous look in his eyes remained. "Are you trying to say that the captain of the ship takes the inheritance out on purpose? And what's his purpose?"</p>

  <p>"He specifically wants to hand it over to either Zheng or Yan," Harold answered.</p>

  <p>As he listened to Harold's response, Marsh fell speechless.</p>

  <p>"If I want to obtain the inheritance, then I have to leave my name on the top of the stone tablet. That's easy! A piece of cake!"</p>

  <p>Someone else had taken the lead.</p>

  <p>A top-rank True God of humble origin was the first to rush up. He shot at the top of the cyan stone tablet with might.</p>

  <p>However, his speed suddenly became incomparably slow.</p>

  <p>A powerful aura emitted itself from the huge words spread at the top of the cyan stone tablet and pressed down on the top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>One hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Two hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Three hundred feet...</p>

  <p>As the True God continued to rise, the pressure only became greater and greater. He could barely endure it anymore.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>When the True God reached a height of approximately four hundred feet, he stopped abruptly, seemingly having crashed into an invisible wall.</p>

  <p>He fell down like a stone thrown into a pool at once.</p>

  <p>He didn't reach the top of the cyan stone tablet. There was no way for him to mark his name. It was completely impossible.</p>

  <p>As the other True Gods watched the scene, they naturally followed suit, but most of them equally stopped at the four-hundred-foot mark.</p>

  <p>Anywhere above that, it was as though they were stopped by an invisible wall of irreproachable strength.</p>

  <p>"Let me try!"</p>

  <p>Wesley shouted.</p>

  <p>His body turned into a cyan light, and a pair of illusory cyan wings suddenly spiraled out and spread around him.</p>

  <p>He flapped his wings a couple times before flying upward with precision and skill.</p>

  <p>Just as Wesley was about to reach four hundred feet in height, his body began trembling violently. He lost control of himself!</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he grunted.</p>

  <p>He flapped his wings once more. This time, he broke through the invisible wall and flew all the way up.</p>
