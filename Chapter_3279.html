  <p>
</p>

  <p>It looked like the man was telling the truth. He wasn't able to see who Luo Zheng was. Otherwise, he wouldn't have dared to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, no ordinary Souls of Light could cause Luo Zheng any real damage.</p>

  <p>Attacking him was like courting death.</p>

  <p>"It's okay," Luo Zheng said, finally relaxing.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The two armors were nearly catching up. Any moment, they would be climbing out of the basement.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wanted to run away right away. He was already exhausted from trying to lose them during the climb.</p>

  <p>"These two armors are strong. We have to go," Luo Zheng announced as he dragged Ling Shuang's arm.</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race looked at each other and hesitated.</p>

  <p>They knew that the two armors could not leave the basement.</p>

  <p>The basement was, as a matter of fact, a trap. As soon as the thin wall was destroyed, the two armors would be activated, resulting in the collapse of the underground passage. All the Souls of Light inside would die.</p>

  <p>The armors weren't supposed to be capable of climbing out of the basement.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li people exchanged looks of hesitation.</p>

  <p>The girl's brother reacted out of haste. "We have to get out of here right now! The armors are too powerful! Let's go! Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>The others reacted the same way. They pretended to be scared.</p>

  <p>As they were about to leave, Ling Shuang halted in her tracks. "Wait," she said, grabbing Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>She felt that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>She looked at the crowd. They were acting strangely.</p>

  <p>After the door of the basement was opened by the Ear Mice, all the Souls of Light of the other races had entered, but they stayed outside.</p>

  <p>There might be two reasons.</p>

  <p>First, they only came after the armors entered the basement. Perhaps they didn't want to enter it when they saw how bad it was.</p>

  <p>Second, they might have stayed outside because they knew that something bad was going to happen in the basement.</p>

  <p>At first, Ling Shuang believed the first option. She thought the people were just passing by, clueless about the truth.</p>

  <p>However, Ling Shuang found it odd that they did not even flinch at the sight of the armors. They even hesitated to leave upon Luo Zheng's command.</p>

  <p>It was not until the girl's brother reminded them that they stirred into action.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang could tell that they were acting.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race stopped in their tracks. They wondered what Ling Shuang was thinking of.</p>

  <p>This only confirmed Ling Shuang's speculation. She snickered as she walked towards the hole.</p>

  <p>"Be careful." Luo Zheng followed behind her. It was unlike her to act recklessly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was curious as to what Ling Shuang had in mind, so he did not stop her.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang stood by the hole and looked down. "Look," she said, nudging Luo Zheng to look below.</p>

  <p>The two armors were hanging five feet away from the hole. To Luo Zheng's surprise, they were not moving at all.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The two armors raised their heads and their eyes flashed red. However, they did not move an inch.</p>

  <p>Curious, Luo Zheng squatted at the square hole and stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>The armors were not willing to give up. One of them pulled out a rusty saber and brandished it into the air.</p>

  <p>The saber was far away from Luo Zheng, so it couldn't hurt him.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Ling Shuang warned.</p>

  <p>She was afraid that Luo Zheng was being too risky.</p>

  <p>The other armor pulled out two rusty sabers. This caused it to lose its grip and fall down.</p>

  <p>It dropped more than a thousand feet and, soon, its body was heard clanking against the ground. Luo Zheng and Ling Shuang looked and saw that it created a big hole.</p>

  <p>The other armor did the same thing. However, just as soon as they got rid of the armors, something happened.</p>

  <p>Wisps of colorful fog gradually rose from the underground, completely blocking Luo Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>"Look! What's that?" Something small was floating along the fog, but Ling Shuang was having trouble seeing it clearly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at it closely. "It's an hourglass," he said, narrowing his eyes.</p>

  <p>It floated amidst the thick fog? an hourglass the size of a fist.</p>

  <p>The sand inside it was dripping quickly. Every time the top half emptied, it would automatically rotate and continue its flow again.</p>

  <p>Each time the hourglass turned, everything in the underground room reversed back in time.</p>

  <p>The two armors returned to the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>The chains that already broke became whole again.</p>

  <p>Even the wall, which had already been partially broken by Luo Zheng, repaired itself.</p>

  <p>The basement restored its original state. The collapsed passage floated and reconnected with the square entrance.</p>

  <p>Nearly everything was restored. Only the dead Souls of Light remained in their dead state.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a moment to think about his next steps. Clearly, something was wrong. He turned his head to look at the people behind him. "You knew this would happen."</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race remained silent. It was difficult to explain, but they didn't want to admit it.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to talk to me peacefully, then maybe we should resort to tougher means. What do you think?" Luo Zheng's voice became as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>He could kill anyone in sight easily in the Grand Sky Temple. There was no place for them to run to.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the humans thought that Luo Zheng would spare them. They did not know that he wouldn't hesitate resorting to violence if necessary.</p>

  <p>"We can't force the back door of the Grand Sky Temple open. If we do that, everyone will die," the girl's brother explained.</p>

  <p>It was no use to continue tricking Luo Zheng. He had to tell the truth.</p>

  <p>"Is there a way to open it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Everyone was silent again.</p>

  <p>If they revealed the clue, they risked exposing their identities.</p>

  <p>It would be as good as surrendering their lives to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Say it," Luo Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang tilted her head slightly.</p>

  <p>"I heard you talk about the Nine Li race outside the temple," the girl chirped. "You don't intend to harm the Nine Li race, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Sally!"</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>She then kept silent, not wanting to disappoint her companions.</p>

  <p>She knew she asked a foolish question.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a good time to ask such things.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng had the upper hand. She was but a powerless being compared to him.</p>

  <p>She nearly told Luo Zheng that they were from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Everyone else stood tense and worried as Luo Zheng and Ling Shuang exchanged a meaningful look.</p>
