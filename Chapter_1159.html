  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under the fearful gazes of so many divine-level talents, Luo Luo Zheng began climbing up the pyramid. He stopped at the 35th floor.</p>

  <p>"Why is he going to the 35th floor?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know... But he seems to be going towards that narrow door!"</p>

  <p>"The golden leaf? His target is the Black Star pickaxe? It's a vain attempt. Does he have a way to take it out?"</p>

  <p>A warrior who entered the special narrow door on the 35th floor would land at the middle of the tree, also the place where the golden leaf was.</p>

  <p>And within that leaf was a supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>This piece of information had been obtained from the Feather Holy Sea a long time ago, which meant that most of the martial artists in the four divine kingdoms were very clear on this.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that there was a supreme divine weapon on the 35th floor, and it was a very strange pickaxe. But no one had been able to take it out.</p>

  <p>For so many years, many powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had used many methods. But none of them had been able to break the light golden leaf and obtain the Black Star pickaxe.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had just entered the 35th floor with full swagger.</p>

  <p>Could it be that he knew a way to break the light golden leaf?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had previously given the crowd the impression that he was capable of everything, which was why they had instinctively thought that it was possible for Luo Luo Zheng to get the Black Star pickaxe. But it was a while before they shook their heads in denial, after considering the toughness of the job.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible! If it were that easy to get the Black Star pickaxe, the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm would have obtained it a long time ago!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right. I guess that Tianxing is only trying it out there. But a supreme divine weapon is not ordinary. He can't take it away!"</p>

  <p>"This guy's brute force is very strong, but he has only managed to injure War Emperor York. He might not stand a chance to take out the Black Star pickaxe unless his strength increases tenfold!"</p>

  <p>As the crowd discussed Luo Zheng's move among themselves, a few curious warriors even began climbing up the pyramid. The 35th floor was a bit dangerous for divine-level talents, but if they were to encounter the green mineral-devouring bugs, they could still escape in time. And as long as they didn't run into the purple mineral-devouring bugs, there wouldn't be any danger. The purple mineral-devouring bugs would usually stay on the 40th floor or above, and so far, only Luo Luo Zheng had been able to attract them away from there once. So they thought it would be okay for them to go up there.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists entered the narrow doors on the 35th floor, as well as the doors below.</p>

  <p>And because only one warrior could pass through a narrow door at a time, a few brave ones even entered the narrow door on top of the one that Luo Luo Zheng had entered.</p>

  <p>Standing on the light golden leaf, Luo Luo Zheng looked up, down, and around him, and found that there were people everywhere. Luo Luo Zheng was speechless at the scene.</p>

  <p>He was only going to break a leaf. What was there to look about? Did they have to make such a fuss, following him in and watching him?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't hide anything from them, especially not intentionally. He knew that taking the Black Star pickaxe would make a lot of noise and would be impossible for him to avoid being noticed. But he still didn't like being watched like this by so many people.</p>

  <p>'Should I lure a purple mineral-devouring bug down here and scare them away?' Luo Luo Zheng thought for a second, but gave up on the idea on second thought. If they wanted to watch him, then so be it.</p>

  <p>He took a few steps forward onto the light golden leaf and arrived on top of the Black Star pickaxe. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>After his body had become a sacred weapon, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't sure just how much strength he could take on. He had planned to test out his strength the moment he had absorbed the heavenly essence but had been interrupted by Fiona. So he thought now would be a good time to test it out.</p>

  <p>From the moment he closed his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng had been continuously absorbing the power from the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>He slowly absorbed the power of one dragon scale, then ten, then a hundred, and then a thousand...</p>

  <p>When his body had been a fairy weapon, it had only been able to take in the power of a thousand dragon scales at most. If he had as much as tried to absorb more of that power at the time, his physical body could have collapsed.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Luo Zheng directly activated the power of a thousand dragon scales, and then went on to two thousand.</p>

  <p>He could feel the terrifying power slowly flowing through his body, like streams of condensed body fluids that were crawling through his limbs and bones.</p>

  <p>His body could handle the power of two thousand dragon scales. So he decided to try and activate more.</p>

  <p>Three thousand!</p>

  <p>He had activated the power of three thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>"I can still handle it!" he muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could feel every cell in his body swelling up. Each cell of his body contained a power that if poured out, would produce a terrifying effect, the exact repercussions of which even he couldn't place a finger on.</p>

  <p>He hadn't reached his limit yet. He could still handle it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took another deep breath and activated the power of four thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A violent crackling sound could be heard coming off the bones in Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Zheng's physical body had reached the level of the mysterious weapon, his bones had rarely produced such sounds. This was because every part of his body had become incomparably tough. The sounds could only be heard when his joints swelled to their limits and could not bear any more pressure.</p>

  <p>Now that he had summoned such immensely intense power, every cell in Luo Zheng's body swelled once again. His body cells had now reached their limit.</p>

  <p>"Look! Luo Luo Zheng seems to have grown taller!"</p>

  <p>"His body seems to have doubled in size!"</p>

  <p>"How did he do that? I think his body is filled with power!"</p>

  <p>There were a lot of warriors lying prostrate at the edge of the leaves around Luo Luo Zheng to watch him. Some brave warriors focused all their attention on the changes in Luo Zheng's body. A few timid ones would occasionally look around to see if any mineral-devouring bugs were approaching. If they really came, they only needed to turn over to fall off the leaves and run for their lives.</p>

  <p>'Is this my limit? It shouldn't be, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, frowning.</p>

  <p>He felt a burgeoning pain in every part of his body. He also felt restrained, as if he couldn't control the power of the four thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>"It looks like I have to refine my body again. But I haven't gathered enough primordial energy," he said to himself. Luo Luo Zheng had refined his body once it had become a fairy weapon. But after Luo Zheng's body had become a sacred weapon, he hadn't had the chance to refine it. After all, the red dragon was still sleeping.</p>

  <p>Could the power of four thousand dragon scales smash through this golden leaf?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned, hesitating. Not a chance! He quickly pushed that possibility aside.</p>

  <p>The powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm had thought of many ways to try and take the pickaxe out of the golden leaf. Although only one master could land on the golden leaf a time, there were many leaves around. Other masters at the Soul Sea Realm could occupy the leaves surrounding the golden leaf. If they hadn't been able to destroy the golden leaf with a combined attack, Luo Luo Zheng assumed that he probably wouldn't be able to break open the leaf with just the power of four thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>'Five thousand!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't hesitate and continued to summon the power of more dragon scales.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's body was wracked with unbearable pain as the power of the five thousand dragon scales erupted. The pain came from every cell in Luo Zheng's body, and the intensity was outrageous. This was unbearable!</p>

  <p>'The state of forgetting myself!' An idea suddenly struck him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had employed a technique he had previously used. In the state of forgetting himself, Luo Luo Zheng could temporarily forget about the pain of his body. In this state, it was as if it wasn't his body that was suffering the pain, but someone else's.</p>

  <p>The state of forgetting oneself, however, had its pros and cons, because pain was beneficial to the human body in some aspect. When pain came from the body, it was a signal to tell you that it was overloaded or that there was something wrong with it.</p>

  <p>If one couldn't feel the pain, it would only cause more damage to one's body.</p>

  <p>But right now, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice. Since he had already made his decision, he would go all out.</p>

  <p>The power of five thousand dragon scales surged into Luo Zheng's body. As every part of his body had swelled to the limit. The cracking sounds stopped, but in the next moment, a wound suddenly appeared on Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>The sound of ripping cloth rent the air.</p>

  <p>A stream of blood burst out from Luo Zheng's chest like a blood arrow shooting out, cutting open his clothes. Luo Zheng's chest had been ripped open by the immense force, and blood was gushing out at an alarming rate, tearing his clothes to shreds.</p>

  <p>"Pa!" "Pa!" "Pa!" "Pa!"</p>

  <p>Soon after, blood arrows shot out from Luo Zheng's back, legs, and shoulders, to everyone's utter astonishment and shock.</p>
