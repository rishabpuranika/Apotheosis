  <p>
</p>

  <p>As more and more Other Shore Tokens emerged from Zheng's space ring, the Ear Mice's eyes grew wider and wider.</p>

  <p>"It's of the fifth grade! I can't believe it!"</p>

  <p>"There are three Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirteen. Two are fourth-grade, and one is fifth-grade!"</p>

  <p>The three Ear Mice had Indigo Souls. Although they weren't powerful fighters, they knew their trade.</p>

  <p>Even though they were in shock, they still managed to gather their wits.</p>

  <p>With briefly exchanged glances, one of the three quietly left the room through the back door.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was preoccupied with taking the Other Shore Tokens out of his space ring, out of the corner of his eye, he observed the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>Seeing one of them leave, Zheng inadvertently smiled.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse had probably gone to find out the origin of these Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>The other two Ear Mice began to busy themselves, assessing the values of each of Zheng's Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>As expected, the value of the fourth-grade Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirteen was higher than that of those from Stage Twelve.</p>

  <p>The fourth-grade ox skull from Stage Five was sold for only one hundred thousand soul pills, but a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen was worth two million and five hundred thousand. And a fifth-grade one from Stage Thirteen was worth nearly twenty-two million!</p>

  <p>"This is a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Three," one of them squeaked. "We usually don't buy such things. It's worth fifty thousand soul pills. But we will make an exception for now."</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand soul pills for a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage One," the other added.</p>

  <p>The two Ear Mice assessed the Other Shore Tokens, commenting on each of them.</p>

  <p>Zheng was well aware that they were just stalling, but he wasn't worried. He wasn't in a hurry, anyway.</p>

  <p>Since the Ear Mice were so intelligent, Zheng knew it would only be a matter of time before they'd find out what happened to the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng thought about this, the Ear Mouse that had quietly left earlier finally returned. It looked directly at Zheng. "I have something to discuss with them," it squeaked, gesturing at its colleagues. "May we have a moment?"</p>

  <p>"Okay." Zheng nodded and sat there quietly.</p>

  <p>Then, the three Ear Mice left the room to confide in each other.</p>

  <p>"I've asked around already," the Ear Mouse said. "A few days ago, the temple of the Bearing race was destroyed!"</p>

  <p>"What? Their temple was destroyed?!" one cried in shock.</p>

  <p>"Who destroyed it?" the other asked.</p>

  <p>The other two Ear Mice wiggled their whiskers in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Not only was their temple destroyed, but all their accumulated wealth, like soul crystal and Other Shore Tokens, have been looted," the Ear Mouse continued. "What's more, they've warned us not to buy their Other Shore Tokens if someone tries to sell them!"</p>

  <p>The other two shrugged indifferently. The Ear Mouse race had offended many races in the past. Offending one more race wouldn't hurt. Even though the Bearing race was one of the strongest human forces, the Ear Mice were under the impression that there was nothing the Bearing race would be able to do if they wanted to buy these Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who was powerful enough to destroy their temple," one Ear Mouse mused.</p>

  <p>"Haw haw, it was a human who destroyed the temple of the Bearing race," the first Ear Mouse continued. "And he also destroyed the city that the Separate Abyss race had built in Stage Eleven. In fact, he almost destroyed their temple, too!"</p>

  <p>The other two Ear Mice stared at it, wide eyed.</p>

  <p>"What? Did I hear you wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Did you just say 'a human'?"</p>

  <p>The Bearing race was one of the most powerful human forces. Moreover, the Separate Abyss race was one of the top super forces in the Source World. They had taken control of Stage Eleven, garnering the support of the Abyss Spirit race. It had been difficult for the Ear Mice to get any news there.</p>

  <p>The other two Ear Mice shook their heads in disbelief. This was just too much!</p>

  <p>"Even the powerful Indigo Souls in Stage Thirteen couldn't do those things."</p>

  <p>"Right. The power of the Indigo Souls in the Lust World is indeed limited.</p>

  <p>Besides, even the top masters in the Desire World can't do those things."</p>

  <p>Seeing how its peers didn't believe what it was saying, the Ear Mouse said in a hushed whisper, "It's because he is not a soul, but a corporeal body!"</p>

  <p>"A what? Corporeal body? It makes sense, but..."</p>

  <p>"How can a corporeal body enter the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>The other two Ear Mice couldn't take it anymore. There was too much shocking news.</p>

  <p>With his corporeal body, one could run wild on the Other Shore. The ridiculous things could be explained reasonably in this way, but it sounded even more ridiculous to enter the Other Shore with a corporeal body.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if you believe it or not. This is the news I got," the first Ear Mouse said impatiently.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were good at sifting through information; they knew fake news from the truth.</p>

  <p>"So, if that's the case, should we buy the Other Shore Tokens from that guy?" an Ear Mouse asked, pointing a thumb back at the enclosed room.</p>

  <p>The first Ear Mouse hesitated but said, "Of course!"</p>

  <p>Even if they had bought the loot, the Bearing race wouldn't find it easily.</p>

  <p>Even if the Bearing race found it, they could resort to sophistry. Whatever happened, it wouldn't pose too much of a problem if they ended up offending the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>However, they figured that person selling the loot must have something to do with the corporeal body that wreaked havoc throughout the stages.</p>

  <p>After all, he had destroyed the city of the Separate Abyss race all by himself!</p>

  <p>If they dared to offend him, they might be expelled from Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>They concluded it'd be better to please this seller at the risk of offending the Bearing race. After all, the Ear Mice always aimed to maximize benefits.</p>

  <p>Good and evil were just abstract concepts to them, nothing they could be bothered with.</p>

  <p>After reaching a unanimous decision, the three headed back to the room, treating Zheng in a more friendly manner.</p>

  <p>In total, the price of Zheng's Other Shore Tokens was estimated to be over sixty million soul pills.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Zheng was a little disappointed at the number.</p>

  <p>So many Other Shore Tokens were only worth sixty million soul pills, which was equivalent to sixty finger-size chunks of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Even though these Other Shore Tokens were useless to him, he was hoping they'd amount to much more than that.</p>

  <p>"Fine, you can exchange the soul pills for soul crystal and pay me," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Exchange for soul crystal?"</p>

  <p>The three Ear Mice shook their heads in unison.</p>

  <p>"Aren't one million soul pills equivalent to one finger-size chunk of soul crystal?" Zheng asked, knitting his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice laughed squeakily. "The soul crystal is too rare. It is priceless, so we usually don't exchange the soul pills for it."</p>

  <p>The soul crystal was extremely scarce on the Other Shore. The super forces needed to support their members, and they didn't have much. Thus, the price of the soul crystal soared, and now, one finger-size chunk of soul crystal could be exchanged for one million soul pills.</p>

  <p>But even then, the supply fell short of the demand.</p>

  <p>Most races wouldn't be foolish enough to exchange the soul crystal for soul pills.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was not because those Other Shore Tokens were not valuable.</p>

  <p>Over sixty million soul pills were a huge amount of money, but soul crystal was just too precious.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Separate Abyss race had no choice but to obey Zheng's orders. That was why they took out a hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Zheng didn't force the Ear Mice to pay him soul crystal.</p>

  <p>After all, they were businessmen, not fallen warriors.</p>

  <p>Although they were annoying, they could be useful in some situations.</p>
