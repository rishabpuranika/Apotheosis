  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sixteen life stones formed a circle around the leaf and wrapped themselves around the glowing object. The said object emitted a blinding flash of light, which made it hard for Luo Zheng to figure out what it was.</p>

  <p>Without giving it much thought, Luo Zheng lifted the pickaxe up high into the air.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>He already knew that the leaves on the upper layers were thicker and bigger. Their blue color was also more vivid, and their structure was more solid as well.</p>

  <p>While the leaves were thick, their toughness exceeded Zheng's expectations. There were no cracks on the leaf at all when he slammed the pickaxe against it.</p>

  <p>"This..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened, and he was clearly astonished.</p>

  <p>Although he only had a low-grade sacred weapon on him, he could easily split a mountain in half with his strength without having to use his forceful energy. Was the leaf under his feet really so tough?</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had finally found these life stones, so he wouldn't give up so easily.</p>

  <p>As he thought of it, the power of a hundred dragon scales burst forth from his body. Then, he picked up the pickaxe again and hit the leaf with it!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>When the pickaxe hit the leaf, a small crack appeared on its surface.</p>

  <p>"The leaf is not that hard!" A faint smile spread on Zheng's face. He continued to swing his pickaxe when he saw that his attack was effective. The cracks spread more with each strike, and on his last blow— it finally shattered.</p>

  <p>It was only then when Luo Zheng removed the broken parts with the pickaxe that the life stones underneath were revealed.</p>

  <p>The look in Zheng's eyes softened as he gazed at the life stones. Ning Yudie was still waiting for him to bring back the life stones to save her life, so he carefully stored them one by one into his space ring. After he was done, he turned his gaze to the shiny object.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't see through the thick leaf clearly just a while ago, but now he discovered that it was a square crystal. The light inside flickered continuously like water, and reflected a bright, white light.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what kind of ore it is, but I'll take it first!" Luo Zheng didn't hesitate and placed the shiny ore inside his space ring. Then, he leaped again and descended into the void below. He followed a circle of flashing light and once again, he fell from the side of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng finally reached the ground and steadied himself, he was greeted by the sight of Callan, Fiona, and Randy.</p>

  <p>Randy gave him a faint smile. Just as when he was about to ask Luo Zheng if he'd obtained anything, he was disrupted by a loud shriek nearby.</p>

  <p>"Wow! So beautiful!"</p>

  <p>"Fredric, you are really very lucky! You even dug out and got a fire stone the first time you entered it!"</p>

  <p>"Fredric, I'm willing to pay a big price for your fire stone. Would you sell it to me?"</p>

  <p>All the fuss immediately caught the attention of Luo Zheng, Randy, and the others. They saw Fredric with a round stone in his hand, which seemed to be engulfed in faint flames. It looked absolutely marvelous.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Randy calmly glanced at the stone. "Fredric is lucky enough to have obtained a fire stone!" he told Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This fire stone was a supreme treasure when it came to refining weapons with fire properties, and it was also quite useful for weapon refiners. It cost warriors in the Harlen Divine Kingdom five high-grade sacred weapons in exchange for a single fire stone!</p>

  <p>"This is not luck! This is the good destiny of the crown prince of our York Divine Kingdom! It's not something that those nobodies can compare to!" a divine-level talent of the York Divine Kingdom said coldly. Since Luo Zheng had completely made the York Divine Kingdom lose face, even when personal grudges were put aside, the warriors of the York Divine Kingdom naturally grew hostile towards him.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the fact that they weren't strong enough, they would've swarmed over Luo Zheng and tore him to pieces by now…</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard them, he simply smiled. Who would've thought that Callan would say, "Isn't it just a fire stone? I got one too!"</p>

  <p>Then, he also took out a round stone and tossed it in the air. Upon closer look, Callan's stone seemed larger than Fredric's!</p>

  <p>Callan's talent was inferior to his sister's, and he was also quite dull.</p>

  <p>However, he had a lot of luck. It didn't take him too much to dig up such a large fire stone.</p>

  <p>A cold snort passed from Fredric's lips as his gaze shifted to Luo Zheng. As the crown prince, he didn't say anything, but someone beside him understood what he meant.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what Tianxing from the Harlen Divine Kingdom has dug up. Can you let everyone take a look?" someone hissed.</p>

  <p>A wave of calmness and indifference washed over Luo Zheng as he glanced at the group of guys. These divine-level talents were really disgusting.</p>

  <p>They even competed against the others after they dug up a few ores. Luo Zheng didn't really want to use childish words to describe their behavior.</p>

  <p>But after a while of thought, he didn't bother with them. Although the four great divine kingdoms were several times bigger than the Central Region, there was no war among them. Even killing was a rare occurrence. To be fair though, while the divine-level talents all had first- rate skills, they were far less mature than the warriors in the Central Region, and hardly comparable to the warriors in the Sea God Continent during the period of turmoil.</p>

  <p>He wondered whether those divine-level talents in the four divine kingdoms were lucky, or they just didn't try to make any progress.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "Does whatever I dug up have anything to do with you? I won't tell you!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that he hasn't found anything valuable. Maybe he is unlucky today and is unwilling to take the stuff out to avoid being embarrassed," that warrior jeered. "You're so boring," Luo Zheng said with a roll of his eyes.</p>

  <p>This group of divine-level talents was so childish, so he vowed to never do such things that would make him look immature as them.</p>

  <p>At this point however, Fiona silently strode towards them. She suddenly extended a hand towards Luo Zheng and said, "Stretch out your hands!"</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Luo Zheng, who was stunned. Still, he subconsciously stretched out one hand.</p>

  <p>"Two hands!" Fiona continued. Luo Zheng was confused, and wondered what Fiona meant.</p>

  <p>However, he still stretched out both hands, and curved his fingers. When Fiona was satisfied, she slightly shook her own hands.</p>

  <p>As she did so, some objects began to fall down one by one from the space ring on her finger, down to Zheng's hands!</p>

  <p>They were life stones!</p>

  <p>These life stones were different from other ores, and they were easily shattered. While Luo Zheng watched the life stones fall out of Fiona's space ring, he held them carefully in his hands, afraid that they would fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>In just a little while, his hands held more than twenty life stones.</p>

  <p>"I give them to you!" Fiona said with a smile. She was quite a scrupulous woman.</p>

  <p>After the battle at the West Dragon River had ended, she remembered that Turner said Luo Zheng needed the life stones. Up until that moment, she had dug out many life stones, but no one knew whether she actively looked for them, or she unintentionally found them.</p>

  <p>As for the other things, Luo Zheng might reject them, but he would definitely accept the life stones.</p>

  <p>When the nearby warriors saw Fiona generously give the life stones to Luo Zheng, they became green with envy. While the life stones weren't as precious as a fire stone, they were still worth a lot…</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also didn't want to take Fiona's life stones without giving her anything in return. He'd dug up a dozen or so life stones as well, but he couldn't possibly use them as a gift. While he thought of that, his lips suddenly curved into a smile. He said, "Thank you. But here, I also have something for you!"</p>

  <p>When he collected the life stones earlier, he found a shiny object in the middle of them. Luo Zheng wasn't sure what it was. He only thought that it was extremely beautiful with its flickering crystal light, so it was a good idea to give it to Fiona.</p>

  <p>However, just as when he took the object out, Randy suddenly gasped loudly and violently coughed a few times. He then looked at Luo Zheng fearfully and asked, "Tianxing, are you sure you want to give that thing to Fiona?"</p>

  <p>The cubic object Luo Zheng took out was truly eye-catching, so it instantly drew everyone's attention with its bright, white crystal glow.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone stared at the strange object in shock, while the divine-level talents looked at it with blatant greed and obvious jealousy.</p>
