<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the group of cultivators tried to flee, the plant grew rapidly and formed a flower bud that bloomed right in front of their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Malcom waved his fist in the direction of the strange plant.</p>

  <p>Malcom's surging fist Mu Ning enveloped the plant with billowing smoke, creating a muffled sound.</p>

  <p>But when the smoke dissipated, he was astonished to see that the plant was completely unharmed. The flower bud continued blooming. Soon, the face of a ghost would form on it.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Let's fly higher!" Fabian urged.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was fully alert. When he heard Fabian's words, he instantly lifted his body and flew upward. The orange light barrier around the treasure hanging on his chest turned into a circular protection barrier that enveloped everyone within.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, as they flew up to the sky, the green plant also started to grow upward at the same speed that they were flying.</p>

  <p>"Be quick! Don't stop!" Jarrod roared.</p>

  <p>Everyone moved as fast as they could. By the time the flower bud fully bloomed and revealed the sinister face inside it, they were quite a distance away from it. All of a sudden, they heard a terrifying scream coming from behind them. Fear gripped their hearts.</p>

  <p>"It's not over yet! Look at the ground!" A top-level war lord of the Night Group said with a fearful expression as he pointed below.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked down and saw many green dots appearing on the ground below them. It was obvious that each of these green dots was a sinister plant. In fact, there was only one plant, but its huge body was buried deep underground. At this moment, its roots were spreading upward and approaching them quickly.</p>

  <p>"It seems that we can only speed up and try to get away from it!" Move at your full speed! Follow me!" Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>As he finished his words, the forceful energy within his body erupted, leaving a thin line of smoke as he rapidly flew through the layers of fog.</p>

  <p>His speed had suddenly increased by 30 percent!</p>

  <p>When the others saw Luo Zheng speed up, they tried to keep up with him in order to stay inside his light barrier. Fabian and Jarrod exchanged a glance before they merged their life vitality together. The two formed a gray shadow and managed to keep up with Zheng's speed.</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't have to use any secret techniques. She maintained the same speed as Luo Zheng and followed closely beside him no matter how fast he moved.</p>

  <p>Malcom, on the other hand, grabbed hold of Rehaan and tried to carry his companion forward. The pair of black wings on his back continued to flap as he followed closely behind Luo Zheng. Anyway, he knew that he would definitely die here if he failed to catch up with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Esther also used her full strength to move fast. There was a faint white light flashing within her and the other two top-level war lords of the Demon Night as they closely followed behind Malcom and the rest.</p>

  <p>The two members of the Night Group, however, were in a miserable state.</p>

  <p>They were good at stealth and concealment, but they weren't really suited for such high-speed movement. They had been able to keep up with the others in the beginning, but once everyone had started to move at their full speed, these two poor guys found themselves left out of the light barrier's defense.</p>

  <p>"Wait! Wait for us!</p>

  <p>Help!"</p>

  <p>The two top-level war lords from the Night Group wailed miserably from behind.</p>

  <p>However, no one could afford to care about them at this moment. Moreover, the danger they were facing now had been caused by Shane from the Night Group. Even if these two men managed to escape from this danger, Malcom would personally kill them afterward in revenge.</p>

  <p>Failing to move any faster, the two top-level war lords were soon surrounded by the green plants. Moments later, the others heard mournful screams coming from behind them. Although they didn't turn their heads back, they could imagine what was happening to the two war lords.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the others hadn't completely escaped from the crisis yet. The speed at which the plant was traveling underground was astonishing.</p>

  <p>Although they were all moving forward at such high speed, many small green dots kept emerging on the ground below them.</p>

  <p>They continued fleeing for another five minutes.</p>

  <p>By then, Fabian and the others had already consumed several life vitality crystals. Even Luo Zheng had used two life vitality crystals to replenish his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Finally, they couldn't see any more green dots on the ground. It seemed that they had managed to get away from the huge plant underground.</p>

  <p>Everyone let out a sigh of relief. They were glad that they had managed to escape the hunt of one of the monsters in the core area.</p>

  <p>They were all feeling extremely exhausted now. Only Xun, who was carrying her spear in a leisurely manner, had a relaxed expression. She had the body of a sword spirit which was almost weightless, and Luo Zheng was the one who had carried her all the way.</p>

  <p>"Le-let's take a rest!" Fabian said, crumpling down to the ground as soon as they all landed.</p>

  <p>Esther, on the other hand, stood ramrod straight on full alert. Staring straight ahead, she said, "I'm afraid there's no time for us to rest."</p>

  <p>Everyone followed her eyes and found that the red dot was in front of them.</p>

  <p>In fact, at this moment, it could no longer be described as a red dot.</p>

  <p>What was in front of them was actually a sleeping gigantic beast!</p>

  <p>It was difficult to describe the size of this gigantic beast. Several miles away from them was a huge crater. For this gigantic beast, it was a large crater, but for humans, ogres, and Demon Night members, it was a bottomless abyss!</p>

  <p>The beast's skin was completely dark and only its head protruded out of the abyss. However, its head alone was already the size of ten mountains. Two huge fangs stretched out from its mouth.</p>

  <p>The fangs were also the length of a mountain. As for the so-called red dot, it was actually a huge red circle above the beast's head.</p>

  <p>"W-w-what's this damned monster?"</p>

  <p>"Is this a super legendary beast? I've never seen such a huge thing before!"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to believe that such a colossal beast is sleeping under our Sea God Continent. If it wakes up, won't it overturn the entire Sea God Continent?"</p>

  <p>Everyone lowered their voices as they commented.</p>

  <p>Hearing their cautious way of speaking, Xun suddenly giggled loudly.</p>

  <p>"What are you guys afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"Shh!"</p>

  <p>"Shh!"</p>

  <p>Fabian, Esther, and the others immediately put their finger to their lips, indicating for Xun to be quiet.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled faintly. "If that beast could be awakened so easily, the Sea God Continent would have disappeared a long time ago!"</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "Yes, it's not that easy to wake it up."</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this?" Malcom asked with a puzzled expression. In the beginning, his goal had only been to kill Luo Zheng at this place. However, with all these new developments, he couldn't understand what was happening, let alone control anything!</p>

  <p>When had such a thing appeared under the Sea God Continent?</p>

  <p>A creature as powerful as this shouldn't even exist in this world! If this beast woke up one day, even the two sacred places of the ogres would be nothing more than a joke.</p>

  <p>Yolande pulled at Zheng's clothes. "Let's continue forward!"</p>

  <p>As they approached the gigantic beast, they noticed that the fog was gradually becoming thinner while the Dark Nether Death Light from the red circle above the beast's head was becoming stronger!</p>

  <p>The power of the Dark Nether Death Light had already reached its peak at this distance. If any of them walked out of the range of the orange light barrier, there was no doubt that they would be killed instantly by the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>To make sure that they remained within the orange light barrier, they had to move at the same pace as Luo Zheng. The space around the orange light barrier was completely filled with the red-colored Dark Nether Death Light. They all stayed close to Luo Zheng for security, even Malcom.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, what exactly is this beast? Is it a legendary beast? Or a super legendary beast?" Esther asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>This unexpected exploration had caused Esther, Fabian, and Malcom to feel a great sense of crisis.</p>

  <p>"It is neither a legendary beast nor a super legendary beast. It's a fierce beast that is called the Mad Scorpion. It's actually the watchdog of hell,"</p>

  <p>Yolande replied flatly.</p>

  <p>"The watchdog of hell?!" Everyone gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>They'd only heard of hell in ancient texts and legends. Nobody knew whether hell really existed or not. That was why they were all shocked by Yolande's words. Esther took a deep breath and then asked, "Does hell really exist?"</p>

  <p>Yolande continued to walk forward as she shook her head and replied ambiguously, "Hell may exist..."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Esther asked. She knew that Yolande might be unwilling to answer her question, but she had no way of forcing her to answer it. Anyway, this answer at least sounded better than the words, "I won't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" Luo Zheng asked after a moment of silence, staring at the gigantic beast.</p>

  <p>"Forward," Yolande said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"But what else could be ahead other than this beast?" Luo Zheng asked. Was she leading them into the abyss? Or were they about to enter this gigantic beast's mouth?</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, Yolande said, "Your Jade Butterfly will give you the answer."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately took several steps back, his whole body on high alert.</p>

  <p>"How do you know that I have a Jade Butterfly?"</p>

  <p>The corner of Xun's lips curled up as if she had already expected this to happen. Her eyes were filled with mockery as she stared at Yolande.</p>
