<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2019 Questions </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mike had constructed this universe.</p>

  <p>So the creatures in the Evolutionary Universe couldn't cultivate the most extreme power. This was a limit that all secondary creatures were unable to cross, and also a restriction.</p>

  <p>Only a certain type of warriors could cross this limit? the Godly Geniuses. Once a Godly Genius crossed this limit, they would be able to condense a Godly Tile and separate themselves from the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"These... These are Heavenly Destinies!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed, his eyes shining brightly in the golden light.</p>

  <p>Above the screens, golden beams of light swirled about constantly. Each beam of golden light contained a Law of Causality within the heavens.</p>

  <p>Some of them contained particularly powerful auras, while others didn't contain any auras at all.</p>

  <p>There were strong and weak Heavenly Destinies. Some couldn't even be used in combat. For instance, the Heavenly Destiny of Revival of Supreme Lord Lester could only resurrect martial artists that had perished, but wasn't helpful in combat.</p>

  <p>But there were some Heavenly Destinies that were used for combat, and the auras emitted from these were naturally much stronger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze swept over them, and he could vaguely distinguish the uses of some Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>A Heavenly Destiny on the left screen emitted a slight chill, even forming a little ice on top of the screen. This Heavenly Destiny was most likely a complete manifestation of the power of the Ice Law.</p>

  <p>With the comprehension of the Holy Beings, they also had their own comprehensions of the perfect laws.</p>

  <p>This meant that there wasn't just one type of complete Ice Law. With the complete Ice Law, it could extend several extremely powerful profound mysteries.</p>

  <p>For example, the Ice Cold Flame that Luo Luo Zheng had comprehended from Holy Jay was a special kind of profound mystery of the Ice Law.</p>

  <p>Not too far away from the Ice Law, streams of colorful flames were being spewed out. They formed little cats that frolicked and played with each other as they walked down from the screen. These colored flames were definitely one of the profound mysteries of the ten-layer Fire Law.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord would never be able to pry into the mysteries of the heavens. Luo Luo Zheng was extremely lucky to be able to follow his father into the heavens.</p>

  <p>As father and son continued moving forward, Luo Luo Zheng noticed that some beams of golden light on the screens on both sides of the path were dim.</p>

  <p>"Father, I guess these Heavenly Destinies have already been bestowed upon the Supreme Lords, right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>There were many Heavenly Destinies on the screens. But he had only seen a dozen or so dim Heavenly Destinies, which was why he had become curious.</p>

  <p>Mike nodded. "Yes. These are the Heavenly Destinies that have already been bestowed upon the Supreme Lords."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked confused at this. "Since your path of heavens contains so many Heavenly Destinies, why did you only bestow one hundred and twenty-eight Heavenly Destinies upon the Supreme Lords?"</p>

  <p>Now that the Evolutionary Universe was facing a crisis, an extra Supreme Lord meant an additional layer of combat strength.</p>

  <p>Every single Supreme Lord was an existence that couldn't be looked down upon. Displaying their powerful Heavenly Destinies to the limit would even allow them to deal with a True God.</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head and smiled helplessly at his son's childish question.</p>

  <p>"If that was really the case, I would be willing to generously bestow the Heavenly Destinies upon many Supreme Lords. But there are many restrictions in the way of constructing the Evolutionary Universe, restrictions that not even I can overcome! I have already reached my limit by bestowing one hundred and twenty-eight Heavenly Destinies. If too many Heavenly Destinies were to leave the heavens, it would cause the heavens to become unstable. If it became more serious, it might even cause the entire universe to collapse."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was shocked. He hadn't thought that it was this serious. "Is that so? I get it now."</p>

  <p>As they kept moving forward, a hall appeared before them. A familiar object in the middle of the hall caught Luo Zheng's attention? the Evolution Lotus Flower owned by Master Feng. This Evolution Lotus Flower was also completely golden, but it had a rather dim sheen.</p>

  <p>"This Evolution Lotus Flower is a Heavens-suppressing Object," Mike said, staring at the Evolution Lotus Flower. "I believe you've seen it before."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. Master Feng's Heavenly Destiny was this Evolution Lotus Flower. Master Feng had not displayed the true power of the Evolution Lotus Flower, but it had pressured Luo Luo Zheng extremely heavily back then. It would have been extraordinary if he had used it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, isn't there something you want to say to me?" Mike stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed him. He had constantly asked questions but he had still been beating around the bush. And Mike had seen through his son's thoughts.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback. He scratched his head and thought for a while.</p>

  <p>"Where did Irene Jiang go?"</p>

  <p>"That little girl from the Jiang Clan has returned to the divine land. The Jiang Clan has a special status in the divine land and it guards and operates all the heavens of all the universes. Once Murphy announced the war, the Jiang Clan withdrew Irene Jiang," Mike said with a smile.</p>

  <p>He then shook his head. "That's not the question you want to ask."</p>

  <p>It was not a question Luo Luo Zheng wanted to ask. After all, he had been separated from his father for a long time. He might feel a sense of intimacy with Mike, but in the end, he still felt a little alienated.</p>

  <p>At his father's expression, Luo Luo Zheng hesitated for a moment before asking in a small voice, "Father, who is my mother?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had asked this question before, when he had been very young, because he had never known his mother or how she looked like.</p>

  <p>When he was young, Mike would always give him an excuse every time Luo Luo Zheng asked him anything. Sometimes, he would answer that his mother was dead, and some other times, he would tell him that his mother had disappeared. If Luo Luo Zheng persisted with his questions, Mike would be strict and scold him.</p>

  <p>As a result, Luo Luo Zheng never got a definite answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had thought a lot about it even after he had grown up. Only about a year ago did he come up with a new answer, and that was when he had found out about his identity. Mike had probably "created" him and his sister, and they probably didn't have a mother.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had speculated this but he was unsure of the answer. So he used this opportunity to ask his father the question that he had been longing to ask.</p>

  <p>Mike's face hardened. He hadn't expected Luo Luo Zheng to ask this question. But he softened a few moments later. "You and Yan don't have a mother," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head at his father's nonchalant expression. A sliver of hope had appeared in his heart. "I don't believe it!"</p>

  <p>"It's the truth, no matter if you believe it or not." Mike continued to deny it.</p>

  <p>But the more Mike denied it, the more assured Luo Luo Zheng became.</p>

  <p>He must have a mother. If his mother had died when he was young, Mike would have been able to answer truthfully.</p>

  <p>But Mike was a Holy Being, and it was somewhat ridiculous for him to marry a secondary creature from the Lower World of the universe who would then give birth to Luo Luo Zheng and Yan. Mike merely said that Luo Luo Zheng and Yan had no mother, which was a kind of helpless prevarication.</p>

  <p>This was exactly why Mike's stiff expression and perfunctory reply gave Luo Luo Zheng hope.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't pursue the topic any further, seeing that his father didn't want to talk about it anymore. He was no longer a child, and knew that maybe his father had something that was difficult to say.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then asked, "Father, is Yan well?"</p>

  <p>Mike loosened up, now that Luo Luo Zheng had stopped fixating on the earlier question. "She entered the divine land a long time ago and is being personally trained by my disciples. She won't have any problems."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's and Yan's arrangements mattered the most to Mike, followed by the arrangements of Tianming and Xenia, and then, those of Mu Ning and Nathan... Mike had planned every single step of this. And regardless of how others had performed, the most important thing to him was Luo Zheng's performance.</p>

  <p>Mike only told Luo Luo Zheng in detail about Yan's arrangements and the information of his disciples. He also told him what he might encounter after he went to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Once he was done, Mike stared at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "I remember that you picked out a few cultivation methods in Bromley's Immortal Mansion, and have successfully cultivated the Thunderbolt Annihilation and the Eight Smoky Melodies. But you haven't mastered the most important cultivation method, the Enemy Repelling Arts, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded when he heard his father ask about his own cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>The Enemy Repelling Arts was a shocking cultivation method. It was just like Gus had recommended? if one managed to cultivate it, they would be able to sever causalities, and remove the others' Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, over the past few years, Luo Luo Zheng had spent a lot of time trying to cultivate it, but it was really difficult to comprehend.</p>

  <p>"You can't be blamed for this. The Enemy Repelling Arts is one of the most powerful cultivation methods in the entire universe. If you don't have too many Laws of Causality to practice it, it's very difficult to cultivate. Yet in here, you are able to accomplish twice the results with half the effort!" Mike said.</p>

  <p>Mike was only an energy soul at the moment. There was not much time left. And right now, he personally wanted to teach Luo Luo Zheng everything.</p>
