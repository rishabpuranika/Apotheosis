<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the Evil God's face as if he had met him for the first time.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, he asked him, "What place is this?"</p>

  <p>Before, Zheng wondered if he had fallen into the downgrader's illusion.</p>

  <p>"This? This is the Source World," the Evil God said, spreading out his arms.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around, but he found nothing but fragments of the Burial Land. Everything else was the pitch-black void.</p>

  <p>"This is the chaos." Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>"Your primitive land has been integrated into the Source World. You and I have the same authority. Why don't you sense the scope of the Source World?" the Evil God suggested in a taunting manner.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng could not believe what the Evil God was telling him, he closed his eyes. As he focused on his senses, he began to feel the huge primitive land.</p>

  <p>His body flashed slightly and he reached the edge of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>On a triangular rock, he saw one of the Evil God's avatars sitting there as if he owned the world.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God's avatar saw Zheng, he was neither taken aback nor threatened. He continued to rest on the triangular rock and played with a rock snake, which he had brought up from under the rock.</p>

  <p>This avatar was undoubtedly lucky, especially compared to the Evil God's two million brains.</p>

  <p>"Oh, look what we have here. It's a special guest," the Evil God's avatar said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, was too busy to reply. He looked past the avatar and into the world behind him. It was the inner wall of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Is this the edge of the chaos?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's avatar reached out and slapped the inner wall of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"What do you think? Can't you figure that out for yourself?" he replied with a smirk.</p>

  <p>"But how did you make it?" Zheng curiously asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's avatar shrugged. "I don't know. Go ask the real Evil God," he replied plainly. "Do you want to sit down? Have a cup of tea?" the avatar added, trying to divert the subject.</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng ignored him and returned to where the real Evil God was.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression drastically changed. He already knew the general situation using his omniscient ability, but he was still a bit confused as to how it happened. The Source World was gone, which left behind the black ship, the two billion brains on the square platform, and the six stones scattered at the edge of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"You relied on the six stones to turn the chaos into the primitive land, didn't you?" He tried to confirm with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"You can say that," the Evil God answered indifferently.</p>

  <p>"But how is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>Of course Zheng knew it was possible. He had personally seen it, but he still couldn't believe what the Evil God had done.</p>

  <p>The Evil God turned his attention towards Zheng, who still looked very surprised.</p>

  <p>"In the past, when I was a creature in your inner world, I was greatly limited. I couldn't understand everything outside. Now, I have more power than I need. You won't be able to understand how much power I have.</p>

  <p>What you know is just a small drop in a large bucket. I can let you..."</p>

  <p>Before the Evil God could finish his smug speech, a cloud of black mist suddenly hovered above him and Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Probability Extreme Form!" a voice from the cloud screamed.</p>

  <p>"All of you are going to die!"</p>

  <p>From the cloud came the downgrader. After the destruction of the Burial Land, the downgrader waited for an opportunity to give Zheng a fatal blow.</p>

  <p>When Zheng lost the protection of the primitive land, it became easy to kill him, even if he had the absolute infinite energy.</p>

  <p>Just as the downgrader was about to unleash an attack on Zheng, he noticed the Evil God. He flashed them a malicious grin.</p>

  <p>"I'll kill both of you!" the downgrader shouted.</p>

  <p>When the downgrader destroyed the Source World, he didn't even bother to clean it up at all. He held absolutely no regard for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>There were countless downgraders in the Probability Extreme Form. All of their energies saturated the area. It made it difficult for anyone to fight the energies.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng and the Evil God could even resist, their bodies and souls quickly evaporated, leaving no trace of debris.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The cloud of Probability Extreme Form disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>"It's over."</p>

  <p>Countless downgraders merged into one form. The six pairs of compound eyes on the form's face returned to light green. The downgrader muttered,</p>

  <p>"It still surprises me how difficult it is to deal with these low-grade creatures."</p>

  <p>"Get ready for another surprise." The downgrader heard someone say these words.</p>

  <p>From his left side, the Evil God's figure began to condense, and on his right was Zheng's figure.</p>

  <p>The downgrader's compound eyes began to flash rapidly again. "How could you be reborn?" he asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"See..."</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God became shortly distracted in answering the downgrader's question, the downgrader launched an attack.</p>

  <p>Everything from within a radius of one million feet was submerged by the energies. The newly-condensed figures of Zheng and the Evil God turned into powder, disappearing completely.</p>

  <p>However, just as the downgrader thought he had finally killed the two men, their figures started to condense again. As soon as their bodies were back, the Evil God looked at the downgrader with fake hurt. "Could you let me finish what I'm going to say this time?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" the downgrader growled.</p>

  <p>Once again, he used his energies to cover the area to kill Zheng and the Evil God once and for all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>As soon as the energies emerged from the downgrader, the Evil God gently waved his hand.</p>

  <p>When he did this, a black light band flashed up and bound the downgrader's body. At the same time, he quickly approached the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"I really do hate being interrupted. How about you?" the Evil God said before raising his fist and smashing it into the downgrader's head.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The downgrader's body shot up like an arrow in the sky.</p>

  <p>The Evil God quickly moved up, kicking the downgrader downwards.</p>

  <p>Just as the downgrader was falling, the Evil God moved to where the downgrader was, launching a palm strike at him.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>The downgrader was like a sandbag, flying up and then falling.</p>

  <p>It was smart of the Evil God to bind the downgrader with black light band because it completely restricted all of the downgrader's powers. He had him at the palm of his hands.</p>

  <p>The Evil God specifically chose to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the downgrader, knowing how much the latter considered this form of battle as an insult to his power.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the black light band with a thoughtful expression.</p>

  <p>'That is an incredibly higher level of energy, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Not only had the Evil God comprehended the blood powers and the Extreme Form energies, but he also comprehended a higher level of energy. He was a terrifying opponent.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was in disbelief with what he was seeing, the downgrader was even in more disbelief.</p>

  <p>He was very sure this was the Field energy of the sixth-grade world. He was in the Silent State Field, which was supposedly the most powerful one.</p>

  <p>However, the sixth-grade world had already been completely downgraded and no longer existed!</p>

  <p>The Field energies could no longer be used. Not even the downgrader or Clarence could violate this rule.</p>

  <p>The only reason why the downgrader could still use the bloodline powers and the Extreme Form energies was that the Deep Space and the main world still existed.</p>

  <p>But how could this mere human being use the Field energy?</p>

  <p>How could he have broken the rules?</p>

  <p>"I've had enough!" the downgrader roared.</p>

  <p>Surging energies gushed out of his body, but they all rushed inside the black light band. This frustrated the downgrader, but he knew what to do.</p>

  <p>After all, he was born in the thirteenth-grade world. He was very familiar with each level of energy.</p>

  <p>The Silent State Field was powerful, but the downgrader forcefully broke through it using several Extreme Form energies.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>As his body emitted the Extreme Form energies, the black light band, which was first absorbing the energy, began to dissolve little by little.</p>

  <p>As the downgrader, who had just regained his freedom, was about to launch a counterattack, the Evil God told him, "You could use the Extreme Form energies to break free from the Silent State Field because of the infinite energy only. What about this? Let's see if you can break through this one!"</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>With two sharp chirps, two asymmetric triangles locked the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"The Weight energy!" the downgrader cried out loud. He began to scream so loudly that Zheng and the Evil God thought it would cause the world to shake, but they let him do it. Anyway, it was the only thing the suppressed downgrader could do in this situation.</p>
