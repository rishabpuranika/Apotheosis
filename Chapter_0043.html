<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng returned to the square along the same path, he felt comfortable.</p>

  <p>Even though the same pressure was weighing down on his body, he felt as light as a feather, as if he could fly with just a simple jump.</p>

  <p>Now that he was at the peak of the organ refining level, his every breath could last longer time than before. Zheng also noticed an improvement in his strength. As soon as he could see the square and the pressure decreased, Zheng found that he could run the rest of the way.</p>

  <p>Those who had not passed the initial exam had already left. And the participants who had succeeded had gathered in the square for the next round. Zheng looked around and approximated that about a thousand participants were in the square. Compared to the tens of thousands of participants before the exam, it seemed as though the elimination rate was up to 90%.</p>

  <p>Just as he entered the square, Zheng could see a man waving at him excitedly.</p>

  <p>He moved closer to the man and smiled when he saw that it was Nory Mo.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Zheng! Here! Come here! You passed the initial exam! Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Nory looked at Zheng's jade pendant, which was now shining bright red.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "Do I need to exchange the jade pendant for the disciple card? Where can I make the exchange?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you need to collect the disciple card. And I know where to make the exchange. I just got my disciple card. Follow me!" Nory answered as he tugged at Zheng's sleeves excitedly. On seeing Nory's enthusiasm, Zheng smiled and nodded. Then, they headed toward a corner of the square where a long table had been placed. On the way to the corner, Nory explained, "Here we are. After exchanging the pendant for the disciple card, we become temporary disciples of Cloud Sect."</p>

  <p>With Nory's help, Zheng was able to take off the jade pendant and ready to make the exchange.</p>

  <p>Behind the table, two people from Cloud Sect were busy with the exchange.</p>

  <p>One of them glanced at Zheng and then took the jade pendant from him. He examined it carefully for a while. He appeared to be checking the information recorded in the jade pendant.</p>

  <p>When done, the man pulled out a small wooden board wrapped in silver and a tiny graver.</p>

  <p>He started to carve on the wooden board. To Zheng, it appeared as though the man was waving the graver around the wooden board quickly. The only indication of the engraving process was the fine sawdust pooling on the table. Even before Zheng could gauge his movements, the man had finished.</p>

  <p>The speed with which he had completed his task added mystery to the man's skill. When Zheng took the small wooden board and glanced at it, two words,  Zheng Luo, had been neatly engraved on it.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at the man. The man nodded and said, "Take care of your disciple card and wait there."</p>

  <p>Zheng bowed in acknowledgment. With the exquisite disciple card held in both hands, he said, "Thank you." Even though he had been a slave for two years, Zheng was still a courteous young man. Once he had stepped away from the table, Zheng examined his disciple card. The silver frame wrapping around the antique wooden board glistened in the sun. It was typical Cloud Sect style, classic and elegant. The free-style strokes with which his name had been engraved on the board showed the other side of Cloud Sect, free thinking. Zheng played with it for a while and then walked to Nory.</p>

  <p>As Zheng stood in the corner with Nory, he studied the other participants. The square was filled with nervous energy. A thousand people stood in the square, waiting silently. Some were standing alone in corners, just as Zheng and Nory were. Some had gathered together in small groups. Regardless of whether they were alone or within a small group, they were secretly observing the other participants.</p>

  <p>The initial exam did not require the participants to compete with each other.</p>

  <p>As long as the participants completed the distance prescribed by Cloud Sect, they moved to the next stage. Unless they provoked someone, just as Zheng had faced trouble with the four men, passing the exam was quite simple.</p>

  <p>However, the next test would be more difficult because it included an elimination system. Eighty percent of the people present would not pass the next exam!</p>

  <p>A long time passed before instructors came to the square. Under their guidance, the applicants got together and then left the square.</p>

  <p>They trudged through the difficult trails of Cloud Sect until they reached an even mountain. Compared with the other steep mountains of Cloud Sect, this mountain was not high or broad. But it was strange that the whole mountain was blood red.</p>

  <p>Not only was the soil on the mountain a deep red, but also all the plants growing on the mountainside were blood red. In the midst of its green counterparts, the mountain stood out for its color.</p>

  <p>When Nory saw the mountain, he exclaimed, "This must be the famous Bloody Mountain."</p>

  <p>"Bloody Mountain. Yeah, the name suits the mountain. It is very unique.</p>

  <p>And it is very unusual too." Zheng was also bewildered by the mystery.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the disciples will face the legendary Blooded Test," Nory said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything unusual about this Blooded Test?" Zheng had never heard about the Blooded Test before, and so he had to ask Nory for more information.</p>

  <p>Nory was not as well read as Zheng. But Nory had a few advantages when it came to information about Cloud Sect. Born in the capital, Nory had been determined to enter Cloud Sect since childhood. Hence, he had collected information and learned about the rules of Cloud Sect from his families and clan. Compared with Zheng who came from a small county, Nory was understandably more familiar with the rules of Cloud Sect and its exams.</p>

  <p>Since he and Zheng were friends, Nory explained to him, "The color of this mountain comes from the unique ore it holds. It's called magic red sand."</p>

  <p>"Magic red sand? The ore that is used to make the magic array?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he heard Nory's explanation, Zheng's eyebrows rose in surprise. He had heard of this magic red sand, which was an essential material in illusion refining. When forging mysterious weapons, refiners would add magic red sand, and the weapon would have confusing effects. In addition, this kind of ore was often used in magic arrays and illusion papers.</p>

  <p>Acknowledging Zheng with a nod, Nory added, "Yes, I heard that the powerful people in Cloud Sect used magic red sand to transform the whole Bloody Mountain into a large magic array for trial and evaluation. Today, the instructors have brought us here. So, we must be prepared for the Blooded Test."</p>

  <p>Nory had heard about the Blooded Test, but he was unsure about the details.</p>

  <p>Considering that the magic red sand was used for illusion refinement, the test must be related to unreal illusions.</p>

  <p>Although all the participants were curious about the test and the mountain, they got no further information from Cloud Sect's mentors. The disciples had been brought to the foot of the mountain, where they were accommodated in rows of houses located there.</p>

  <p>That evening, everyone rested early in preparation for the next day's Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning, the disciples gathered at the foot of the mountain.</p>

  <p>A long while passed, but they received no orders to go up the mountain.</p>

  <p>After waiting for several hours, the disciples finally realized why they had not been allowed to go up. They were waiting for other people to join them.</p>
