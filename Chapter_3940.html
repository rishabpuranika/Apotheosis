<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The altar formed by the triangular petal was a living being.</p>

  <p>As far as the kings of Diabolic Demons knew, none of the Eternal Realm warriors who were locked up in the altar had succeeded in breaking free.</p>

  <p>After all, they hadn't been able to catch the powerful Eternal Realm warriors. The ones they had caught were weak.</p>

  <p>But unfortunately for them, they had encountered the strange phenomenon that was Zheng.</p>

  <p>The hollow thorns kept stabbing Zheng and piercing into his body, but they couldn't get any blood. The altar seemed to sense the changes in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>As a result, more tendrils with hollow thorns began to grow.</p>

  <p>The hollow thorns remained in Zheng's body once they pierced through it.</p>

  <p>More and more of them stung and pinched at him with every passing minute.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Zheng's body became densely packed with thorns, making him look like a hedgehog.</p>

  <p>As the number of hollow thorns in Zheng's body increased, little room was left for his blood vessels to move.</p>

  <p>"There is no way out. Why don't you fight back? Isn't this enough?" Zheng said through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart was divided into many parts, connected by a main meridian, to avoid the hollow thorns.</p>

  <p>"Who are you talking to? Why is your body so special?"</p>

  <p>The voice came from inside the living altar.</p>

  <p>"I'm talking to myself, obviously," Zheng said with a wry smile. "My bloodline is special, or I would have torn you apart by now."</p>

  <p>"You alone?" the living altar sneered. "I don't know how you've changed your blood vessels but I will stab more thorns into your body."</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>More hollow thorns appeared and shot towards Zheng in unison.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at this sight. Only by infuriating the living altar would the ancestry-level bloodline take the matter seriously.</p>

  <p>He would then suffer less.</p>

  <p>After the last wave of thorns got into Zheng's body, the twisted blood vessels could no longer escape them and were pierced in many places.</p>

  <p>"Since you're locked up here, there's no point in struggling," the living altar said as it began to greedily draw the blood from Zheng's blood vessels.</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised as he saw this, his eyebrows rising.</p>

  <p>How was the ancestry-level bloodline allowing itself to be sucked out by the living altar?</p>

  <p>"The bloodline in your body is strong and pure. I like it a lot! Mmmm so delicious..." the living altar said excitedly as it sucked on Zheng's blood.</p>

  <p>But before it could finish talking, it stopped suddenly and let out a painful scream.</p>

  <p>The triangular petal around the altar turned gray. It was obvious that it was poisoned. When the gray turned black, deep holes began to appear on the petal in quick succession.</p>

  <p>The king in the lead approached and watched as the petal turned black and huge holes began to expand rapidly. It then drooped and withered just as quickly. All its life energy dissipated, and the light column that had soared into the sky disappeared.</p>

  <p>The king, as well as the three other ones behind, was stunned.</p>

  <p>All the Diabolic Demons were still kneeling in devotion, their heads bowed.</p>

  <p>They didn't realize that their altar had rotted and died.</p>

  <p>"Wh-what happened?" the king nearest to the petal stuttered.</p>

  <p>In that moment, Zheng struggled out of the tendrils and began to pull the hollow thorns out of his body.</p>

  <p>The densely packed holes brought great pain to him but they were not serious wounds. As the green light flashed on the surface of his body, they all began to heal, one after the other.</p>

  <p>"This altar has eaten something that shouldn't be eaten," Zheng said, smiling as he fixed the king with a firm gaze.</p>

  <p>"You did all this?" the king asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that a human warrior at the Eternal Realm could destroy the altar.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Zheng said, nodding. He was sure that the ancestry-level bloodline was part of him.</p>

  <p>"You!" The king was now positively fuming. "I'll teach you a lesson!" he said, waving his sharp claws as he charged at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Time to make a move?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, staring at the king.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline knew it couldn't let Zheng fight the king of Diabolic Demons alone. So it began to surge within his body.</p>

  <p>A burning sensation erupted at the fingertips of Zheng's right hand. It felt like flames were dancing on his skin. He subconsciously raised his hand and pointed at the king.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Zheng's fingers began to expand and soon were boring into the king's chest.</p>

  <p>The king looked at Zheng, confused, his body trembling. Seconds later, he fell to the ground, motionless.</p>

  <p>Zheng retracted his fingers as the king fell.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at his fingers, surprised. This time, the ancestry-level bloodline had only transformed his fingers, but it had been surprisingly useful.</p>

  <p>But the moment the king fell, the mud beside him arched suddenly into a pointed pile. The pile quickly changed colors from red to black, and then turned into the king.</p>

  <p>"You want to kill a Diabolic Demon on the Diabolic Earth? You dream too much!" the king sneered.</p>

  <p>Zheng had discovered this characteristic of the Diabolic Demons while fighting them underground.</p>

  <p>No matter how many pieces they were cut into, they would always be able to revive themselves. It hadn't occurred to Zheng that they could become immortal with the help of the Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>The fact that the four kings had the ability to be reborn over and over again spelled trouble. Zheng would find it difficult to escape the Land of Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>The king walked towards Zheng. He had only taken two steps when Zheng discovered that with every step he took, a black footprint was stamped on the scarlet Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>"The color on your body is fading," Zheng pointed out.</p>

  <p>The king looked down and his face froze.</p>

  <p>The black color on his body spread along his feet and into the Diabolic Earth, like a dye dripping into water.</p>

  <p>"Poison!" the king roared, jumping up into the air and trying to fly.</p>

  <p>But his body suddenly felt powerless and he fell to the ground once again, this time, merging into the Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>He could still be resurrected since the Diabolic Earth could help him through the process for an infinite number of times.</p>

  <p>The poison on Zheng's fingertips, however, hadn't been aimed at the king, but at the Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>"Our Diabolic Earth has been poisoned!"</p>

  <p>"Dig away the black earth!"</p>

  <p>"Kill that brat first!"</p>

  <p id="top_5">The other three kings screamed, flustered.</p>

  <p>Their greatest crisis was not that they were facing Zheng, but the poison that had spread throughout the Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Demons rushed to dig the black Diabolic Earth out. But the earth they dug out merely rose high into the air and fell to the ground again.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that the black poison had spread not only across the surface of the Diabolic Earth, but also deep underground.</p>
