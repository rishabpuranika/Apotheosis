<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2380 The Entire Divine Land Fell Into Silence </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings looked at Zheng with cold eyes.</p>

  <p>In the entire divine land, they were known to be the most powerful figures. One of the things they hated the most was being threatened.</p>

  <p>They wanted to witness how Nicholas would deal with a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>The moment Nicholas walked towards Zheng and Joy, the female leader's body trembled slightly, and she had weirdly appeared in front of him in a flash without making any movement.</p>

  <p>"You promised me that you won't make trouble on the Astronomical Transit Day," the female leader said with a slightly crisp voice.</p>

  <p>Nicholas paused his step at her words with a foot lifted in the air. His slightly thick eyebrows furrowed and he answered back, "This is a special case."</p>

  <p>"Is there always a special case when you want to make trouble?" the female leader of the Sun Blind race asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. So what? Are you trying to stop me? Or do you think you can stop me?" Nicholas' domineering aura expanded in his breezy momentum as he stared at the masked female leader.</p>

  <p>It made the masked female leader go silent for a while.</p>

  <p>She was in charge of the Time Sea Forbidden Land, but that didn't mean that she fully controlled the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was not the owner of the Time Sea, but she didn't have the power to fight against him. She couldn't do anything to him.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!" Nicholas said dryly.</p>

  <p>The female leader had to move aside silently.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, somewhere in the divine land, a phenomenon occurred.</p>

  <p>Thick dark clouds stretched over countless miles, and blotted out the sky completely covering the sun.</p>

  <p>Even the strongest sunlight could not penetrate through the black clouds.</p>

  <p>During the day, the black clouds gathered in silence.</p>

  <p>But in the evening, the maintained silence was disturbed.</p>

  <p>Thousands of souls had come back to life. The souls screamed, rolled, entangled and wrestled on the clouds. One divine era was like this, and so were a hundred divine eras.</p>

  <p>Stronger souls swallowed up weaker ones, and the stronger souls could devour every other souls.</p>

  <p>The primordial law of the jungle was incisively and vividly displayed in these thick dark clouds.</p>

  <p>Some powerful souls occasionally would fall from the black clouds when they became strong enough. But another fierce competition awaited them. In the Soul Wilderness, the most common thing was the strong souls.</p>

  <p>There stood a huge figure, moving from the thick black clouds to the depths of the Soul Wilderness.</p>

  <p>It was known as the Wilderness Giant.</p>

  <p>The Wilderness Giant was completely shaped by souls.</p>

  <p>It had its own intelligence and had the special soul ability.</p>

  <p>Even in the cruelest Soul Wilderness, the Wilderness Giant could stand at the top of the food chain.</p>

  <p>However at this moment, its dignified appearance looked different. The Wilderness Giant was half kneeling on the ground, cautiously holding something on its shoulder.</p>

  <p>On one of its mountain-like wide shoulders lay a graceful woman.</p>

  <p>A light green dress covered the woman's shoulder all the way to her snow-white thighs. The very fitting dress fully highlighted her figure.</p>

  <p>The wide shoulder of the Wilderness Giant emitted a trace of black aura, covering half of her white and slender legs, as if she was sleeping in the soft black clouds, looking lazy, tired and charming.</p>

  <p>She was Estelle who controlled the Soul Wilderness.</p>

  <p>For a long time, Estelle had lain on the Giant's shoulder.</p>

  <p>To feed her own soul, she continuously got nourishment from the Wilderness Giant's powerful soul.</p>

  <p>This kind of feeling made her calm, putting her in slumber.</p>

  <p>But all of a sudden, she opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>An aura of mystery was immediately emitted from her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile was revealed on her face as a hint of shock showed deep in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What a lovely guy! Your ability to cause troubles is really beyond my imagination!" she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Guu..." resounded a strange sound from the Wildness Giant's throat.</p>

  <p>Estelle gave it a pat and said, "It's not about you!"</p>

  <p>She never thought that not long after she left the Swirl Forest, Zheng had already arrived in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's talent, there was no doubt that he could possibly enter the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>What surprised Estelle was that in such a short time, he had already offended Nicholas.</p>

  <p>She leaned on the shoulder of the Wildness Giant and gently lifted an arm, and a scepter flickering orange glow appeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>It was the Scepter of Gods' Silence.</p>

  <p>"Wooo..."</p>

  <p>"Errr..."</p>

  <p>"Aww..."</p>

  <p>The Soul Wilderness was usually boisterous.</p>

  <p>Those damn souls fighting day and night made annoying sounds.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the appearance of the orange scepter in Estelle's hand made a change.</p>

  <p>The nonstop voices and clashing sounds suddenly came to a halt!</p>

  <p>There were awe, anxiety and fear spreading in the air.</p>

  <p>Those emotions exuded from pure souls without any disguise.</p>

  <p>Estelle held the scepter in one hand and placed two slender fingers beside her pink lips.</p>

  <p>She slightly opened her mouth, and let out a breath.</p>

  <p>"Shh... Stop talking..."</p>

  <p>In a flash, an invisible force spread out at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>The speed was beyond the normal speed. For a second, the force had swiftly covered half of the divine land, and covering the entire divine land only took three seconds.</p>

  <p>The entire divine land fell into silence!</p>

  <p>Every divine citizens and True Gods in the divine land had become dumb.</p>

  <p>The sound of the tide lapping on the shore, the buzz of insects, the rustle of the wind through the trees, the drip of rain from the eaves, human voices, sighs, and cracks...</p>

  <p>All sounds from faintest to loudest were gone.</p>

  <p>A top-rank True God was flying up in the air seconds ago.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to fly higher, he felt that he was unable to launch the momentum in his body. He fell down in a snap making him greatly frightened. He cried out but became more terrified. He didn't hear any sound as though he was deaf.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Everyone in the divine land thought that they were deaf!</p>

  <p>It was because all the voices were muted and the sounds had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The True Gods couldn't use any of their abilities either.</p>

  <p>The divine texture arrays had been restrained.</p>

  <p>The arrays that had kept the Floating Islands above the Time Sea were also affected. They began to drop rapidly.</p>

  <p>The situation was not different on the island of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings floating in the air also fell down.</p>

  <p>Most of the Holy Beings maintained the posture of standing. Even if they were silenced, they kept an elegant and steady landing.</p>

  <p>Clark at that moment was idly lying on the wide flame throne.</p>

  <p>When everything was silenced, the warm flame surrounding him suddenly died out.</p>

  <p>His bell-sized eyes widened in shock as he uttered, "Oh", but not a sound was heard coming from his throat.</p>

  <p>Before he even had the time to react completely, he fell down involuntarily. His broad body was stretched out, creating a big crater in the ground.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Nelly, Liusu and the other True Gods had watched everything that transpired and were greatly shocked. It was beyond their expectation that a Holy Being could fall down so embarrassingly. They wanted to laugh, but they dared not for the situation was deemed serious.</p>

  <p>Back to Nicholas, he steadily balanced his feet on the ground.</p>

  <p>He already understood what had happened. In his universe, the nine stars were conjectured together like a necklace. In this form, the nine stars could gather the power at the fastest speed.</p>

  <p>This time if the Faith Energy would be silenced, Nicholas had planned to make a move using his pure strength.</p>

  <p>Although he reacted quickly, Estelle was much quicker to act. When Estelle lifted the Scepter of Gods' Silence, the small petal between Zheng's eyebrows spread out.</p>

  <p>The petal formed a unique diamond pattern covering a small area which exactly enveloped Joy and Zheng.</p>

  <p>This place was probably the only small piece of land that hadn't been silenced.</p>

  <p>Joy, who was in desperation, had never thought that Zheng would make such a move.</p>

  <p>The moment the Holy Beings fell down in fast motion, Joy was back to her senses. Seeing Nicholas rushing toward them with a burst of strength, she quickly grabbed Zheng once more. She even saw a glimpse of how Clark fell down awkwardly. She covered her mouth with one hand, and with a touch of irresistible smile in her voice, she said, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the figures of Joy and Zheng had disappeared without a trace from where they stood.</p>
