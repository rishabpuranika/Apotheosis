<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4315 Downgrading </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was absolutely dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know what the "Weight" energy was, the energy level of these two triangles was obviously astronomical.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the downgrader was hysterical. The "Weight" energy should've been one level higher than the "Field" energy.</p>

  <p>"How far has the Evil God gone in comprehending the energy?" Luo Zheng asked, in a daze.</p>

  <p>"This is the energy of the Boundless Divine World, known as Weight,"</p>

  <p>Clarence suddenly spoke up.</p>

  <p>Ever since he gave the absolute infinite energy to Luo Zheng, he had been determined to be nothing but an onlooker. There was nothing in the third-grade world that could arouse his interest. He had even predicted how it would develop in the future.</p>

  <p>However, the method that the Evil God just used instantly piqued his interest, causing him to speak again.</p>

  <p>"The energy of the seventh-grade world..." Luo Zheng clicked his tongue. "He was able to comprehend it on his own!"</p>

  <p>"This is not a problem of comprehension," Clarence said slowly. "The seventh-grade world has already been downgraded by Mastema, and so, the 'Weight' energy can't be used. Therefore, both you and Mastema can only use the Extreme Form energies at most."</p>

  <p>"But he..." Luo Zheng, at a loss for words, just pointed at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why or how either." Clarence was also very confused. "It's really strange that he was able to violate the most basic rules."</p>

  <p>Clarence had seen many geniuses in his time.</p>

  <p>From the twelfth to the fifth-grade worlds, there were all sorts of strange creatures. They had various dreams, goals, great desires and wishes, and were capable of many unimaginable things.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, Clarence felt it was novel to him, but after a while, he lost interest. Every world had an unbreakable limit, and no matter how powerful a creature was, there was nothing they could do to break it.</p>

  <p>In a sense, Luo Zheng had reached past the limit. He not only obtained the bloodline powers, but also the Extreme Form energies, and even the absolute infinite energy of Clarence. However, this had been based on the premise that the Deep Space was not completely downgraded.</p>

  <p>And yet, now, the Evil God suddenly appeared out of nowhere and began to use the "Field" and "Weight" energies. This was just so outrageous that even Clarence couldn't remain silent.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, on the other hand, didn't feel as though he had done anything spectacular. He was too immersed in the joy that came from teasing the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"Well? What's your solution?" The Evil God laughed tauntingly.</p>

  <p>By now, however, the downgrader had calmed down.</p>

  <p>The "Weight" energy was two levels higher than the Extreme Form energy, he realized.</p>

  <p>But indeed, there was a solution.</p>

  <p>The higher-level energy was like a sharper knife, but if it was attacked by endless energy, its blade could still be blunted, maybe even broken!</p>

  <p>What mattered most, however, was that the downgrader was also very familiar with the "Weight" energy.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The densely packed lightning wrapped around the "Weight" energy tightly, flashing violently. The endless energy consumed the "Weight" energy bit by bit, until the surface of the two triangles was completely corroded.</p>

  <p>However, with the current ability of the Evil God, it was very easy to repair the "Weight" energy, because he also possessed infinite energy.</p>

  <p>The reason why he chose not to repair it right away was that he wanted to see the desperate look in the downgrader's eyes.</p>

  <p>Halfway through the battle, the Evil God suddenly felt that something was missing. He stretched out his hand and summoned the black ship over.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven, Duran, and the others were all stunned when they saw Luo Zheng. What surprised them even more was the sight of the downgrader. After a while, however, they calmed down upon seeing that the downgrader was trapped.</p>

  <p>"This is the downgrader you mentioned? He doesn't look very powerful..." the Evil God winked at Duran triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Duran was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>He just couldn't believe his eyes. The downgrader, known to be invincible and unimaginably powerful in the Jade Pure Realm, was losing to the Evil God!</p>

  <p>When the downgrader overheard what the Evil God said, his fury grew tenfold.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, he was the superior one. No one other than Clarence could defeat him.</p>

  <p>He roared angrily, "You are the one who is weak!"</p>

  <p>With that, a ripple of energy exploded outwards.</p>

  <p>The fine lightning that had been zipping around the "Weight" energy started to coil into an azure ball. The sharp sizzling sound of electric current lasted for a while, until all of the "Weight" energy was finally corroded.</p>

  <p>Just as the "Weight" energy was about to disappear completely, the Evil God raised his hand and snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>A vine of energy shot out and wrapped itself around the downgrader like a python. Then, sharp thorns popped out of the vine of energy, piercing into the body of the downgrader, carefully securing him.</p>

  <p>"You were saying?" the Evil God said with a crazed smile, waving his hand lazily.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the energy vine, he asked, "Is this the energy of the eighth-grade world?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's the 'Cube' energy of the ninth-grade world. The energy form of the eighth-grade world is very special, and it's difficult to use it in this world," Clarence answered.</p>

  <p>"Has he grasped the energy at the top level?" Luo Zheng gasped.</p>

  <p>"The energy at the top level is the absolute infinite energy," Clarence said slowly. "He can easily use the 'Weight' energy and the 'Cube' energy, so he must have mastered infinite energy, or there will be a problem with the supply of energy. Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>Clarence was in a good mood. He was absolutely fixated on the scene unfolding before him.</p>

  <p>After all, he didn't want the worlds to be downgraded step by step.</p>

  <p>According to how things were developed in the past, this was the only way.</p>

  <p>With the appearance of the Evil God, however, the situation seemed to change rapidly. Clarence, who had grown cynical, began to feel a flicker of hope.</p>

  <p>Once he realized he couldn't get out of the energy vine, the downgrader gave up struggling. His six pairs of compound eyes turned green as he silently stared at the Evil God, assuming a look of defeat. He calmed down when he finally realized he was no match for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you have won?" the downgrader asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"He asked that again," Clarence suddenly said. "He always asked me that question," he explained to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In Clarence and Mastema's game of cat and mouse, Clarence had always won. Then Mastema would ask him this question, and then begin to downgrade the worlds. This was almost always the case.</p>

  <p>But this time, he was asking the Evil God the very same question.</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled nonchalantly. "You can use whatever means you have. I'll give you a chance."</p>

  <p>"Wait and see!"</p>

  <p>Once the downgrader finished speaking, his six pairs of compound eyes began to dim, one after another.</p>

  <p>His body bound by the energy vine began to shrivel, until it disappeared.</p>

  <p>"You're already dead meat, yet you still try to threaten me," the Evil God sneered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, knew better. With a grim expression, he said in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"This is not a threat."</p>

  <p>The Evil God glanced at Luo Zheng curiously. "Then what is it?"</p>

  <p>"He is going to downgrade the world," Luo Zheng replied bluntly. "The world will be downgraded into the Wall World."</p>

  <p>The Evil God frowned slightly. Only then did it dawn on him that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Just then, the black light floating in the void suddenly began to violently tremble.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The vibrations made a big sound, buzzing in everyone's ears. Even the people in the Immortal Mansion and the black ship could hear it clearly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's figure flashed as he teleported towards the black light, quickly followed by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two of them eyed the black light warily and saw that the space around it was beginning to shatter. The crushed space, like a thin layer of ice, slowly expanded around the black light.</p>

  <p>"The space around the black light has been downgraded to the Wall World," Luo Zheng said gloomily.</p>

  <p>"At this rate, I'm afraid it will take a long time before the chaos is downgraded," the Evil God said with disdain.</p>
