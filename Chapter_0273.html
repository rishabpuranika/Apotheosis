<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The heavy water in the lake was very viscous.</p>

  <p>Zheng jumped into the lake, but almost no water splashed. He sunk slowly after making a ripple on the surface.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng found that he descended slowly. When Zheng was about one meter below the surface of the lake, he realized that he couldn't sink anymore. The buoyancy of the heavy water was astonishing.</p>

  <p>'Adjust your breath and try to sink straight.' With this thought, Zheng changed posture and lowered his head. He moved his hands and forced his body further into the water.</p>

  <p>After a warrior entered the organ refining level, his internal organs underwent a qualitative change. He could rest without breathing because the air could operate automatically in the lung.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had breathed in deeply while on the bank, the air he inhaled could sustain him for a long time.</p>

  <p>"Plump..."</p>

  <p>The heavy water in the lake was viscous, but it was clear. Even though he was three meters below the surface, he could see the surroundings clearly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had read about the Lake of the Magical Fish before. It was bottomless. It was said that a master at the Illuminating Soul Realm at Cloud Sect had once dived to the depth of 300 meters, but nobody could reach lower.</p>

  <p>According to the reports of the disciples that had explored the lake's depths, it could be divided into ten layers.</p>

  <p>The first layer extended from the surface to a depth of 30 meters. The second layer continued from 30 meters to 60 meters, and so on. The tenth layer was at the 300-meter mark.</p>

  <p>Since this was Zheng's first time at the Lake of the Magical Fish, he didn't set a goal. However, to refine himself in the lake cost him hundreds of cubic crystals. Since it was expensive, Zheng was determined to make good use of the opportunity.</p>

  <p>"I will see how deep I can reach!"</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hands and pushed the heavy water in front of him.</p>

  <p>Slowly, he descended further into the water.</p>

  <p>When Zheng reached 20 meters, something yellow approached him.</p>

  <p>Zheng studied the creature. The beast had the head of a fish and the body of a human.</p>

  <p>"Magical murloc!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had learned a little about the creatures in the lake before coming to the Lake of the Magical Fish.</p>

  <p>A large-scaled magic array was set up a long time ago and surrounded the Lake of the Magical Fish.</p>

  <p>Because it was an old magic array, it was said that it consumed a surprising number of crystals. Thirty years ago, someone in Cloud Sect thought this ancient magic array consumed too many crystals and wanted to close this secret cultivating place to save the sect from bearing the expense.</p>

  <p>Many disciples at Cloud Sect objected to the proposal as many nature creatures thought they could make tremendous progress when cultivating in the Lake of the Magical Fish. It was indeed true that several nature creatures had broken the bottleneck after refining here.</p>

  <p>Although the Lake of the Magical Fish was saved, the price to use the lake went up from 25 points to 100 points. In this way, Cloud Sect could afford to continue maintaining the magic array.</p>

  <p>The yellow magical Murloc swam in the heavy water freely. A black spear glimmered in its hands.</p>

  <p>All Murlocs were natural swimmers. They had a layer of thin mucosa on the skin, which allowed them to swim in the water freely. Furthermore, they had gills on their huge fish heads, which let them survive on the bank and absorb oxygen from the water.</p>

  <p>After the yellow Murloc saw Zheng, it kicked its back legs like a frog and swam closer to Zheng. At the same time, it aimed the black spear in its scaly hands at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved slowly in the heavy water.</p>

  <p>He saw the black spear being aimed at him and wanted to dodge, but it was very difficult.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved his hands frantically to avoid the Murloc's attack.</p>

  <p>However, despite his efforts, Zheng only descended two meters lower.</p>

  <p>Compared with the flexible Murloc who was cutting through the viscose water rapidly, Zheng was as slow as a tortoise.</p>

  <p>The black spear in the Murloc's hands sliced through the heavy water and inched closer to Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the spear point was about to stab Zheng, he curled up like a boiled shrimp.</p>

  <p>Zheng shrank and avoided the Murloc's black spear.</p>

  <p>After escaping the spear, Zheng rolled in the heavy water. Most warriors would hit back while dodging.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that when he rolled, he would catch the Murloc as soon as he stretched his hand.</p>

  <p>But when he turned and reached toward the Murloc, he found nothing was in front of him. That Murloc just kicked its legs like a frog's and quickly left Zheng's attacking range.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>Had they been fighting on the bank, Zheng would have no trouble killing the Murloc.</p>

  <p>But in the heavy water, it was extremely difficult.</p>

  <p>This was the purpose of refining in the Lake of the Magical Fish. The heavy water pressure and high-intensity were used to suppress a warrior when fighting Murlocs in the deep water.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the warriors probably couldn't adapt. They would move clumsily and slowly or even be injured in the magic array.</p>

  <p>But when the warriors adapted to the water's pressure and got over the difficulty to move, they would have a qualitative change to exert their strength and experience the battle.</p>

  <p>Once these warriors left the heavy water and returned to the bank, they would feel relaxed.</p>

  <p>After the Murloc swam ahead for a while, it turned and rushed at Zheng again.</p>

  <p>"No. If the battle continues this way, I will be unable to defend against the Murloc!" Zheng considered his options for a long while and wrinkled his brows slightly.</p>

  <p>As an idea flashed through his mind, Zheng snapped his fingers, and his expression changed. The demonic life vitality was released through the finger. With some sparkles, it spread slowly in the heavy water.</p>

  <p>Zheng found that he could not control the demonic life vitality as freely as when he was outside the water.</p>

  <p>Countless tiny turbulent flows and whirlpools were hidden in the lake.</p>

  <p>Being influenced by them, the demonic life vitality was pushed and pulled in all directions.</p>

  <p>Soon, the demonic life vitality was scattered under the current, and it spread out into an irregularly shaped large net.</p>

  <p>But this huge net couldn't stop the Murloc. On the contrary, the Murloc shuttled nimbly in the huge net and lifted the black spear as it prepared to rush at Zheng again.</p>
