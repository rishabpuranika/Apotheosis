<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2730 Tracking The Spiritual Sense </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The purple bugs originally had outspread throughout a large range of the area, but not one had showed any signs of attack.</p>

  <p>However for this instant, all the bugs went crazy.</p>

  <p>Likened to wolves that had smelled blood, they swarmed towards the living creatures below.</p>

  <p>"It's itchy! These bugs are biting me!"</p>

  <p>"It hurts!"</p>

  <p>A consummate True God was immediately surrounded by countless small bugs which made him look like as if he was wrapped up by thick purple mist.</p>

  <p>He struggled madly and repeatedly rolled on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Damn bugs! I'll shatter you into dead meat!"</p>

  <p>A stream of strong internal momentum had then suddenly surged from the consummate True God's body.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The consummate True God seemed to have already lost his mind. The streaks of lightning were like violent dragons shooting towards the people around him.</p>

  <p>The people noticed the sudden change and all had scattered away to avoid the lightning.</p>

  <p>"Keanu! Are you insane?"</p>

  <p>A Demi-holy Being from the Leng Clan scolded as he blocked a streak of lightning with his hand.</p>

  <p>The man who just went berserk was a consummate True God from the Leng Clan and his name was Keanu Leng.</p>

  <p>However, Keanu Leng looked as though he was indifferent to the people around him and still continued to activate his internal momentum crazily.</p>

  <p>It made things difficult for the Demi-holy Being of the Leng Clan to get close to him.</p>

  <p>The small purple bugs could even resist the flames from Clark, so they naturally wouldn't be affected by Keanu Leng's lightning attack at all!</p>

  <p>A few seconds passed as the current situation seemed to get worse.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah, the Holy Being of the Leng Clan, couldn't patiently tolerate it and was about to attack but stopped. Keanu Leng, who kept on rolling on the ground, had also stopped his movement.</p>

  <p>The purple bugs, that forcefully attached themselves to his body, had all flown into the sky.</p>

  <p>Astonishment was written all over their faces when they saw how Keanu Leng looked like after every bug was cleared.</p>

  <p>His body was still intact, but it was evident that there was a big hole on the top of his head. It showed signs that it was bitten by the little bugs.</p>

  <p>The bugs had actually gotten into his head and ate up his soul!</p>

  <p>Keanu Leng was after all a consummate True God. Even if his soul was swallowed up, his body still continued to emit a strong life force. His inner world was still automatically running.</p>

  <p>However, everyone knew that his body now had become nothing but a soulless shell.</p>

  <p>He was not the only one who was attacked. Other five consummate True Gods and three Demi-holy Beings were also attacked by the purple small bugs.</p>

  <p>During the attack, a Demi-holy Being of the Liu Clan soared into the sky and tried to fight off and get rid of the purple bugs. However, as he flew away, he attracted more purple bugs to come at him.</p>

  <p>After a long while, he was not able to fight them off but fell from the air and crashed to the ground with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Similar to how Keanu Leng lost his life, there was also a big round hole at the top of the head of the Demi-holy Being from the Liu Clan. His soul was also swallowed up by the purple bugs, leaving only a soulless shell.</p>

  <p>Nine people, including three Demi-holy Beings, lost their lives in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Everyone's heart was in a mess. They felt nervous and in panic.</p>

  <p>God knew what kind of creatures these bugs were. Even the Holy Beings were unable to kill them, so were they doomed to be unable to get out alive today?</p>

  <p>Some people had already fixated their gazes on the space channel. If they came back from the space channel, they might have a chance to survive.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic! These purple bugs won't attack us on their own initiative!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas spoke in a calm tone.</p>

  <p>At the most critical moment, what he said had calmed everyone down.</p>

  <p>"Yes! These purple bugs only attacked some specific people, not all of us! " Murphy echoed.</p>

  <p>"Don't do anything before everything is made clear! These bugs are indeed very strange," Clark added, sweat was clearly seen on his ruddy face.</p>

  <p>This place was worthy of being called the Abyss Demon Region...</p>

  <p>If they were not alert and careful enough, even Holy Beings could do nothing but await for their tragic fate.</p>

  <p>Everyone kept silent with their lips tightly shut.</p>

  <p>They didn't even dare utter a single word and just looked straight at Nicholas in silence. They were afraid that their voice would attract the purple bugs.</p>

  <p>Nicholas narrowed his eyes as he looked down at the 'living dead' sprawled on the ground. He bowed his head and was lost in his own thought.</p>

  <p>Tianming suddenly spoke up, "These little bugs don't have much wisdom.</p>

  <p>Just now, the Holy Being of the Tang Clan used fire to burn them, but they didn't attack that Holy Being of the Tang Clan."</p>

  <p>"We all know that. Do you think we need you to tell us?" Troy who was just beside him interjected with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Tianming ignored him and continued, "But the reason why these bugs launched attacks was because of a remark of the Demi-holy Being from the Liu Clan."</p>

  <p>"A remark?" Nicholas thought for a while, and his eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

  <p>"Keaton has just shouted 'I am unable to spread out my spiritual sense!'"</p>

  <p>Keaton Liu was one of the group of people who just lost their lives and died. He was a Demi-holy Being of the Liu Clan.</p>

  <p>The situation was chaotic just now.</p>

  <p>Every one of them had struggled to keep their lives and many had ignored this detail.</p>

  <p>Hearing Tianming's words, many people remembered what happened.</p>

  <p>"That's right! When he said that he couldn't spread out his spiritual sense, I also planned to release my spiritual sense..." one of the Demi-holy Beings echoed.</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded in agreement and said, "Perhaps these bugs locate their targets by tracking the spiritual sense. If I'm not wrong, the nine people who have been killed have just released their spiritual sense!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Tianming's words, the Holy Beings could not help but nod as they took note of that important detail.</p>

  <p>Tianming's deduction was very reasonable. Otherwise, these bugs wouldn't have specially attacked just certain people.</p>

  <p>Some people even sweated on their back. If they had released their spiritual sense a moment ago, they would have been dead now. Their bodies would be among the dead bodies on the ground.</p>

  <p>However, this was only a guess. Their lives were still in danger. If it was not confirmed, they would not dare to act rashly.</p>

  <p>Samuel looked towards Lowell with a hint of appreciation in his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was said that Lowell was not from the Dongfang Clan, but an outsider.</p>

  <p>There were only few people who could reach the consummation of True God Realm relying on their own talent. Lowell was really smart...</p>

  <p>Among all the people present, only Samuel had come into contact with these Soul Devouring Bugs.</p>

  <p>The Soul Devouring Bugs were unafraid of any attacks from internal momentum. Be it Thunderstorm Godly Way or Elementary Fire Godly Way, they could not cause any substantial harm to the bugs and they wouldn't be affected at all.</p>

  <p>The bugs only had one weakness. Their perception was very weak as they just floated around a certain area aimlessly all year round.</p>

  <p>But once they sensed the spiritual sense released by someone, they would rush towards their target like mosquitoes that had smelled blood.</p>

  <p>They would not stop until they ate up the soul of their target.</p>

  <p>"We can check whether it is really like what Lowell has said." After saying that, Samuel smiled at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Nicholas looked over at Samuel and asked, "How do you plan to prove it?"</p>

  <p>Samuel moved quickly and got close to the transmission channel. He glanced at the purple Soul Devouring Bugs currently flying in the air.</p>

  <p>With a flash of his eyes, an extremely powerful stream of spiritual sense spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>No sooner had he released his spiritual sense than it was swallowed by these small bugs. He did it swiftly in a short time so that his spiritual sense couldn't spread far in this purple mist.</p>

  <p>Like what had happened before, the purple mist started to surge crazily and sweep towards Samuel.</p>

  <p>The moment he released his spiritual sense, he had already hidden in the space channel.</p>
