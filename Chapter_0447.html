<br/><br/>

  

  <p>A sword that wouldn't rust wasn't sure to be the best, but a rusty sword was definitely not a good choice.</p>

  <p>However, here, the strongest swordsman among the young generation of the Cloud Sect was using a rusty sword. It was hard for the disciples of the Cloud Sect to accept this. They had great expectation for the sword.</p>

  <p>Tianming was unaware of what was being discussed among the crowds at the moment. He slowly lifted the rusty sword and pointed it at the ground. "This sword is called the 'Blood-corroding Sword'." He slowly said, "The red spots on the blade are not rust spots, though they look like them. They're droplets of blood!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was a little astonished on hearing Tianming's words. The disciples who were mocking the fact that what Tianming was flashing was only a rusty sword also received a shock.</p>

  <p>But whose blood would remain so fresh even after thousands of years?</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, if the blood from a common human had splashed on the sword, it would have become dry immediately and formed some blood spots. But after a period of time, the spots would fade and gradually disappear. No human blood stains would last for over three years.</p>

  <p>But the stains on Tianming's Blood-corroding Sword had lasted for thousands of years! Was it the blood from some legendary beast?</p>

  <p>"How can blood remain fresh for so long?" Zheng was also very curious.</p>

  <p>There was a feeling inside him that the blood could emit some magical power.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and replied, "I don't know. But this Blood-corroding Sword has helped me a lot in comprehending the sword philosophy. It also has its own soul that connects with mine. I am telling you this as the courtesy a fellow swordsman shows to another."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled. Tianming was an interesting person, and polite too! Zheng also took out his sword from the space ring. With a tinkling sound, the Streamer Sword was drawn out from its sheath.</p>

  <p>"My sword is named 'Streamer Sword'. It's a low-grade fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>The body of the sword was made by Chase," he told his opponent slowly.</p>

  <p>"It was made by Chase?" Tianming asked curiously.</p>

  <p>As a swordsman, Tianming was interested in all kinds of swords. The last time that Zheng had taken out this sword in battle, Tianming had curiously felt that it was somewhat familiar, as it was almost the same one he had seen at the second floor of the Weapon Pavilion. Several unfinished swords made by Chase were placed there.</p>

  <p>But he clearly remembered that the swords he had seen hadn't been condensed yet, so he was thinking whether he could have been wrong.</p>

  <p>But when he heard that the Streamer Sword was also made by Chase, Tianming was sure that it was the same one he had seen at the second floor of the Weapon Pavilion.</p>

  <p>But that sword hadn't been condensed, how could it suddenly become a fairy weapon?</p>

  <p>To clear his doubts, Tianming immediately blurted out, "If I remember correctly, this sword was one of the three weapons that Chase had refined before he died. But it was only an unfinished work as he hadn't managed to condense it yet. I wonder who helped you in finishing the final condensation process."</p>

  <p>To Tianming's knowledge, the three great weapon refiners who were still alive did not have the ability to condense a fairy weapon of this grade.</p>

  <p>He was asking this out of curiosity. He then added, "I am only a little curious to know which master is able to refine a fairy weapon and helped Chase finish his work after Chase died. If you don't want to comment, or are not allowed to, you can stay silent."</p>

  <p>Generally, a weapon refiner was more familiar with the weapon that he had refined himself. And it was easier for him to infuse his comprehension of the Heavenly Law into the weapon in the condensation process.</p>

  <p>If someone other than the refiner himself wanted to condense an unfinished sword of Chase into a fairy weapon, it would have been very difficult.</p>

  <p>At least no one in the Eastern Region could have accomplished it.</p>

  <p>Hearing Tianming's question, all the disciples were also very curious to know the answer. It seemed that there was a story hidden behind the sword. As the disciples of the Cloud Sect, they more or less knew about the legend of Chase. And quite a lot of people knew that Chase had left this piece of his work unfinished before his death.</p>

  <p>They were also itching to know the answer.</p>

  <p>"Haha! I can tell you. This sword was condensed on the Quenching Peak by me," Zheng answered honestly after thinking for a while. Tianming had been frank with him, so he didn't want to hide anything from him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng had no qualms about letting everyone know this. Since he had chosen to attend the All Peaks Competition, he was going to gain a lot more influence and fame now. As long as he gained enough influence, several of his problems were going to be automatically solved, like Aura, Yan, and some of his own problems.</p>

  <p>"You condensed it all by yourself? At the Quenching Peak?" Tianming was deeply surprised and his pupils narrowed.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "To put it more precisely, I used the weapon refining smelter of the Quenching Peak to condense it."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the crowd burst into an uproar.</p>

  <p>"Oh boy! Did I mishear? Zheng condensed a fairy weapon by himself! Has he already reached the level of a weapon refining master?"</p>

  <p>"Come on! A weapon refining master? That gets on my nerves now.</p>

  <p>Can't you ever stop exaggerating?"</p>

  <p>"He must be bragging unreasonably about this. Any person's energy has got limits. He would have had to practice martial arts to reach such extraordinary level of fighting. Is it really possible for him to condense a fairy weapon at the same time?"</p>

  <p>"But this is not something easy to brag about. Anyone can find out.</p>

  <p>There are so many disciples in the Quenching Peak. If it is a lie, they would expose it immediately. Zheng has no reason to tell such a stupid lie."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Kenneth exhaled deeply. He glanced at Elder Xu who was sitting next to him.</p>

  <p>Getting his message even without him saying anything, Elder Xu nodded and said, "I will send someone to the Quenching Peak to confirm it."</p>

  <p>Weapon refining masters were also very important to the Cloud Sect. No wonder that Kenneth was attaching such great importance to the matter.</p>

  <p>"Do it immediately. Then get news to me as quickly as possible. But I don't think the result really matters." Kenneth heaved a sigh and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu asked, "Do you believe Zheng's words that he condensed the sword himself?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" Kenneth asked back.</p>

  <p>"I believe him." Elder Xu replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Kenneth pointed his fingers at Elder Xu. He didn't know what to say about Zheng's talents that he had shown along the way. He finally replied,</p>

  <p>"I believe in Zheng, too. He has already given me a lot of surprises. Forget about the claim that he can refine a fairy weapon himself. Even if he claims that he is the reincarnation of an immortal, I will also believe it."</p>

  <p>There was probably not a single other soul in Cloud Sect who could get such a comment from Kenneth.</p>
