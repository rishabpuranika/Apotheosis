<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It would appear as though Zheng was not fully in control of the Soaring Snake Sword anymore.</p>

  <p>The sword was trembling violently as he held it in his right hand. To him, it seemed like it was struggling really hard to break free.</p>

  <p>He attempted to tighten his grip on it even more.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The sword continued to vibrate furiously. Suddenly, dark golden strands started to radiate out of it.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the blade of the Soaring Snake Sword became enshrouded by a small snake shadow. Its eyes opened and glinted for a moment. Almost at once, it silently disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, as it vanished, small snake heads emerged on the ends of the dark golden strands.</p>

  <p>Every single one of the strands looked like long and slender snakes. It was almost as if they were truly alive.</p>

  <p>"What's happening? Is this some kind of trick?"</p>

  <p>This fearsome display left the man from the Black Armor race effectively stunned. Instinctively, he brought his Other Shore Token out.</p>

  <p>He acknowledged that the aura emanating from Zheng's sword was indeed remarkable and powerful. Nevertheless, Zheng was merely a consummate True God in his eyes. It did not matter how strong Zheng was. The man was absolutely confident he wouldn't be able to break the invisible shield.</p>

  <p>After all, he was entirely covered by the shield shadow.</p>

  <p>The long and slender snakes were approaching his position very swiftly.</p>

  <p>There were thousands of them now and their movements caused a loud rustling noise.</p>

  <p>There were many rocks and ancient trees that existed for thousands of years within the area. But as the snakes rushed towards their enemy, they were all chopped cleanly in half. The cuts were as smooth as glass.</p>

  <p>The man felt a chill run down his spine.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he noticed that there were cracks all over the shield shadow now. They were starting to spread quickly to his body too.</p>

  <p>The snakes were not even close to where he was. He began to lose consciousness as dark blood spilled out from the cracks in his body. After a short while, he collapsed into the ground.</p>

  <p>Rustle! Rustle!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the snakes continued to move. They demolished and obliterated everything across their path. The man of the Black Armor race had previously created an open area. The snakes had burst out of its boundaries now.</p>

  <p>Every single snake could be compared to a harbinger of death. As thousands of them gathered, they brought about a surge of utter devastation.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are those things?"</p>

  <p>"Halt!"</p>

  <p>As Beldene and the disciples of the cultivation palaces witnessed this, a wave of panic swept through them. Their faces were etched with looks of sheer terror.</p>

  <p>No one even dared to move. They watched in horror as the snakes plowed through the open area towards the other side of the jungle. They continued to ravage everything along the way.</p>

  <p>If this horrific scene was viewed from the skies, it probably looked like an invisible giant was cutting the jungle with a pair of invisible scissors. The flurry of snakes left a flattened path in their wake. Everything that came into contact with them was razed into smithereens.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that a supreme powerhouse is lurking within the jungle? I wonder which side that person is on, the Sword Light Palace or the Black Armor race?" Promptly, Beldene drew a conclusion based on his own observation. Logically speaking, Zheng would surely be saved if that powerhouse was on the Sword Light Palace's side. If not, then he didn't even want to think about how Zheng could have survived that.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the jungle, Zheng was undeniably thunderstruck. He could not believe what just happened.</p>

  <p>Athemar told him he would give him a magnificent and generous gift, but Zheng did not take his words seriously.</p>

  <p>He was not thoroughly impressed with the power of the Imperial Sword Seal activated through the cyan sword. The Imperial Sword Seal might be a precious and supreme treasure to others. But in Zheng's opinion, it lacked power compared to the Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Zheng finally understood what Athemar meant.</p>

  <p>The power of the Imperial Sword Seal was dependent upon the grade of sword he had. A sword with a higher grade would result to a much more powerful attack.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Zheng walked over to where the corpse of his opponent was.</p>

  <p>As he examined the body, he noticed that the cuts were as smooth as glass.</p>

  <p>It implied that this body was no different from the rocks and trees around in the eyes of the snakes.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, the people of the Black Armor race should have bodies stronger than normal humans. Nonetheless, they still couldn't compare to Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>He also observed that the shield shadow created by the Other Shore Token was unable to withstand the assault of his sword strands. It got slashed cleanly apart just like the trees.</p>

  <p>Zheng totally underestimated the sharpness of the sword strands. They were more than what he had previously thought. Until he had tested them out on such an adversary, he would not have known how sharp they were.</p>

  <p>"It's such a shame that no one could ever see this sword. It could only be used when I'm in extreme danger,"</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered to himself. With a wave of his hand, he transported the corpse of his opponent into his space ring. After all, this man was a mighty warrior at the Other Shore Realm. Maybe he could uncover and loot some treasures later.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, Zheng emerged on the edge of the jungle.</p>

  <p>Then, he saw Beldene and the other disciples who stood rooted to the same spot. He was a little bit bemused so he asked them, "Why didn't you escape?"</p>

  <p>It was very unfortunate that these disciples lacked combat experience. After the Sword Light Palace was destroyed, all they could do was put their hopes on Laura. But now, Laura was off fighting against Reynald. This put them into a state of panic as they also had nowhere else to go.</p>

  <p>If it was Zheng in their place, he would have run away.</p>

  <p>The disciples were all stunned when they saw Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it! Zheng, you are still alive!"</p>

  <p>"Did you know who that powerhouse was? Did that person manage to kill the man from the Black Armor race?"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Zheng had been thinking long and hard about how he would explain the sword strands to the disciples even before he started walking out of the jungle.</p>

  <p>However, they already thought that a powerhouse was the one responsible for that. With that, he thought it was best not to explain it further.</p>

  <p>In any case, he doubted whether they would believe he could perform such a powerful technique at his current cultivation level.</p>

  <p>The only thing he could do was pretend to be perplexed by this as well. He told them, "A short while ago, I only saw a figure clad in white and nothing else. All of a sudden, the man of the Black Armor race was slashed cleanly apart."</p>

  <p>"Amazing! That powerhouse is extremely powerful!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe that person can take Reynald on!"</p>

  <p>"Still I wonder if this powerhouse would agree to fight against Reynald."</p>

  <p>With this, the disciples saw a glimmer of hope once more. They hoped that a strong and superior powerhouse would come and save them from all these evils and therefore save the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Zheng knew that they were just getting their hopes up.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, they heard a muffled sound coming from the sky.</p>

  <p>A shadow of a huge sword appeared across the sky. Suddenly, two figures plummeted down and landed in front of the disciples.</p>

  <p>The two figures were actually Laura and Ingram.</p>

  <p>Ingram had lots of wounds all over his body. His legs were chopped off and blood spurted out of the cuts.</p>

  <p>Laura, on the other hand, was half-naked. Her colorless skin was covered with numerous sword marks.</p>

  <p>As this scene unfolded right in front of them, the disciples started to run to them.</p>

  <p>Moments after the two figures fell, a space wave flashed in the air and Reynald promptly appeared before it. He was holding a long sword with a cyan blade. Then he spoke heartlessly, "It's useless to struggle. You finally found your father's tomb after searching for so many years. So now, it's time for you to go to hell and join him for eternity. Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Laura looked at him with utmost contempt and defiance. She gently tapped the space between her brows. Soon after, a ball floated out. It was a Latent Theurgy.</p>
