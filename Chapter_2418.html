<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2418 A Faint Light </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As he lay on the ground, Rufus convulsed for a long period of time before he came back to his senses.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, the Red Fire Thunder hadn't hurt him severely, but the pain it caused was enough for him to remember it for a lifetime.</p>

  <p>As he watched the scene, Rudolf only grew more and more furious. Their Wang Clan was one of the first-tier clans in the Sunrest Tree Region. They had never suffered such loss before.</p>

  <p>He had the burning desire to argue with Luo Zheng, but was stopped by Hayden.</p>

  <p>"This is our fault. If you really want to blame it, then you can only blame the array for its omission," Hayden said, keeping his calm.</p>

  <p>Faced with the Famous Sword Divine City's acting leader, Rudolf was helpless. He could do nothing but glare at Luo Zheng angrily before turning his head in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>After dealing with the two brothers of the Wang Clan, Hayden said to Luo Zheng with a smile, "Congratulations! You're the first True God to get all the Truth Spiritual Swords in the history of the Famous Sword Divine City."</p>

  <p>"Do you actually have a reward for me?" Luo Zheng asked flatly, as he stared at Hayden.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" A look of triumph appeared on Hayden's face. "Of course, you won't receive any true reward. All this means that you'll be capable of walking further on the Sunrest Tree. What's more, I'll be your recommender and thus issue a letter of recommendation in your name. I believe that the elders of Sword Clan will pay special attention to you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't disappointed to hear such a statement.</p>

  <p>In his current situation, it was only normal that he wanted to seize every opportunity he possibly could.</p>

  <p>"Can I get onto the Sunrest Tree right now?" Luo Zheng looked at the west gate in the opposite direction, not far away.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Hayden made way for Luo Zheng and stepped aside. "Of course, please, just head that way!"</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>A True God in a white robe opened the west gate for him at once.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded at Hayden and Marley before walking off toward the west gate.</p>

  <p>"City Lord, don't mind if I ask, but why didn't you investigate his background and identity?" A look of confusion appeared on Marley's face as he watched Luo Zheng's gradually receding figure.</p>

  <p>Listening to Marley, Hayden smiled slightly. Then he said, "Such a fellow is destined to be somebody. I'd bet that he is most likely the son of a Holy Being. Or at the very least, a Demi-holy Being's son."</p>

  <p>"A Holy Being's or a Demi-holy Being's son?" Marley felt somewhat puzzled. "If so, why didn't he come here through our Floating Island, then?</p>

  <p>It would have saved him a lot of trouble arriving here through our Sword Clan's Floating Island."</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say." Hayden shook his head and speculated, "Not all Holy Beings are on the Floating Islands. Perhaps he has his own unspeakable reasons. After the screening is over, I'll naturally have to go investigate him."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng crossed the Famous Sword Divine City's gate.</p>

  <p>As he did so, a wide coastline appeared in front of him. A few unrecognizable sea birds inhabited the beach. Probably because there was a lack of natural enemies here, these birds weren't afraid of humans. When they saw Luo Zheng, they didn't move an inch.</p>

  <p>A root, at least ten thousand feet wide, extended toward the sea. The root was like a giant beast's claw, paving its way to the sky.</p>

  <p>After observing the scene for a while, Luo Zheng strode over to the root.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng stepped just before the root, he felt an extremely thick life energy was over him. It was so great that it could accommodate almost everything and even affect all the creatures on the tree.</p>

  <p>The root was over hundreds of thousands of miles long, and it reached so far off into the distance that no one could see its end.</p>

  <p>"I need to speed myself up..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured to himself. He decided to run forward as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng touched the huge Sunrest Tree, a gentle vibration passed through his feet.</p>

  <p>The rhythmic vibrations continued advancing. It was as if they were stretching out through a vein in a human body and toward a sub-branch of the tree. After turning a corner, the vibrations converged onto one of the tree's branches.</p>

  <p>The vibrations continued to spread through the branch and finally arrived at the Sunrest Tree's trunk.</p>

  <p>Within no more than three seconds, the vibrations had spread over 70 million miles.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the tree trunk, a ten thousand feet wide hole could be seen.</p>

  <p>Deep in the hole, a skeleton whose hand was holding a gray sword was sitting.</p>

  <p>A faint light suddenly appeared in the skeleton's hollow eyes as soon as the vibrations reached the hole.</p>

  <p>The light only existed for a very brief moment before disappearing completely.</p>

  <p>The Sword Casting Divine City was one hundred and thirty thousand miles away in distance from the Famous Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>In front of the magic array used to screen the True Gods, the True Gods had also lined up into a long line. Moreover, thanks to the convenience of transportation in the Sword Casting Divine City, it was needless to say that there were more True Gods in this place!</p>

  <p>Today though, most of these True Gods had fear painted all over their faces.</p>

  <p>A girl in purple was standing in the magic array. She was the one taking part in the test.</p>

  <p>The girl stood on tiptoe and slowly moved forward in the magic array. Her body shifted in an extremely agile manner, and the sixteen Truth Spiritual Swords could be seen floating beside her.</p>

  <p>She was indeed very eye-catching. Notably thanks to her attractive figure as well as appearance, any man couldn't help but try to catch a second glance.</p>

  <p>That said, the True Gods didn't fear her. To the contrary, in fact, it was the young man standing by the magic array that had them all feeling slightly terrified.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it's unreasonable for a consummate True God to bring someone to join the selection?"</p>

  <p>"The girl is really something! She managed to collect sixteen Truth Spiritual Swords!"</p>

  <p>"Shush! Do you even know who he is?"</p>

  <p>"It's been said that his name is Harold Yu, the controller of the Everest Spirit Mountain!"</p>

  <p>As he stared at Yan in the magic array, Harold sighed with emotion in his heart.</p>

  <p>Over the past several years, she had developed greatly, and her excellent performance was beyond his wildest expectations.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for Yan to obtain seventeen Truth Spiritual Swords.</p>

  <p>With a graceful and confident smile on her face, she walked out of the magic array.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The seventeen Truth Spiritual Swords that were circling her slowly came back to their positions.</p>

  <p>"I have succeeded the examination!"</p>

  <p>Yan exclaimed with a relaxed face as she jumped next to Harold.</p>

  <p>"Do you still have a little strength left in you?" Harold asked, with a slight smile curling at his lips.</p>

  <p>Yan thought for a while, pouted her lips and said, "Well, I should be capable of obtaining the rest of the swords as well, but to do that, I'll surely suffer to no end."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, the True Gods who were still waiting in line fell speechless.</p>

  <p>Harold responded with nothing more than a brief smile; he knew what Yan had said was true.</p>

  <p>"Harold, you told me that my brother would come!" Yan said seriously and accusingly, as she stared at Harold.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her words, Harold turned his head back to look at the slowly opening gate. At that very moment, the Sunrest Tree appeared in front of him. "He will. Maybe he's already on the Sunrest Tree," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Then I must hurry up!"</p>

  <p>Yan dashed over to the gate like an agile rabbit, without a second's hesitation.</p>

  <p>Despite her confidence, a hint of worry revealed itself on Harold's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't go to the Everest Spirit Mountain, which disturbed Harold's overall plan.</p>

  <p>Now that he was unable to give Luo Zheng what was left by Mike, he placed all the pressure on Yan.</p>

  <p>Just like playing chess, one false move would lead to a series of problems.</p>

  <p>In particular, Mike's situation wasn't an optimistic one, and Harold couldn't allow any mistakes to be made.</p>

  <p>Even if Harold could calculate everything with his Evolution Divine Dao, no clues were uncovered.</p>

  <p>'This time, no mistake is allowed to be made during the debate over Divine Dao held by the Sword Clan!' he thought to himself determinedly.</p>

  <p>    </p>
