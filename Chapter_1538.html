<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1538 Teleportation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After activating the Teleportation Token, Luo Zheng entered a mystical space.</p>

  <p>Countless red dots lay at his feet as he stood still in a daze.</p>

  <p>According to his conjecture, this Teleportation Token could be used to help him execute the Grand Teleportation technique, allowing him to traverse millions of miles away instantly and move freely within this supreme world.</p>

  <p>Never did he expect that after activating the Teleportation Token, he would be able to escape into such a wonderful space� it completely exceeded the scope of anyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>"The red dots below should represent all the main cities of this supreme world� This is where I belong!"</p>

  <p>The red dots below scattered until they were evenly distributed on the surface. Among them, one dot was cyan in color� not far from this dot was another main city.</p>

  <p>This was where Luo Zheng arrived after entering the Illusion Space� never did he imagine that he would be assigned to the outskirts of the supreme world.</p>

  <p>Just like the map indicated, the main city wasn't too far away from him.</p>

  <p>Except this area, the other cities were still a rather long way from there.</p>

  <p>Recklessly, Luo Zheng decided that if he relied on his flying speed to move forward, it would probably take him quite a bit of time to reach the neighboring main city.</p>

  <p>"Can the Teleportation Token only be used as a map?"</p>

  <p>If this token could mark the main cities but failed to teleport Luo Zheng away, then what was the point of Luo Zheng going through so much to obtain the token? The time and effort he put into it would have been for naught.</p>

  <p>With that thought, Luo Zheng carefully fumbled with the token.</p>

  <p>After a moment of drifting in this space, Luo Zheng headed straight for one of the red dots.</p>

  <p>Just as he arrived at the top of the red dot, the one below him started spinning until a white light shot out from its center. It began spinning faster and faster while releasing an intense force of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>"This is a transmission channel! Furthermore... This channel seems to connect directly to the main city that this dot signifies.</p>

  <p>How interesting�</p>

  <p>If that's the case, won't all the main cities be free to visit?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart pounded rapidly� if this was the case, he could easily loot all the main cities of the supreme world.</p>

  <p>The space wasn't particularly large� it was only a few dozen miles wide.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng walked around in the space and passed a red dot, it would spread out, creating a teleportation channel, offering him a path to enter the main city. If he entered the passage, the transmission channel would disappear.</p>

  <p>A supreme world had tens of thousands of main cities, meaning that Luo Zheng had seemingly limitless choices.</p>

  <p>"Wait! What are these light spots?"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng examined the huge 'map' below him, he discovered that there were three dots in the center, not too far apart from each other.</p>

  <p>They were dark green, in stark contrast to the other dots around them.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng flew toward these light spots, they didn't form the transmission channel, nor did they show the slightest reaction.</p>

  <p>"These three points are also main cities? But it doesn't look like there's any way to enter them now� They must be closed off for some reason,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng guessed.</p>

  <p>After examining the three dots for a while, he didn't linger too long on them. Instead, he picked out a red dot within the central area of the map.</p>

  <p>In this supreme world, the main cities close to the borderline had long distances between each other. Those cities near the center were rather close to each other, so the competition among those main cities was much more intense. Such was the reason why Luo Zheng went for this particular red dot.</p>

  <p>After choosing his target, he didn't hesitate to head straight for it.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped into it, a transmission channel spread out from the dot, tightly wrapping around him.</p>

  <p>Buzz�</p>

  <p>The moment he passed through the transmission channel, Luo Zheng could feel some kind of tinnitus, making him extremely uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>This 'transmission channel' was different from the usual type, after all.</p>

  <p>Normally, a transmission channel connected only two places, compressing the distance between them by a hundred times. But a supreme world's area was far too large� even if the distance was reduced by a hundred times, it would still be too far.</p>

  <p>This Teleportation Token, however, was able to instantly teleport Luo Zheng to his destination, no matter how far the places were. Only masters like world lords had such capacity to exert this kind of theurgy. With the help of his Teleportation Token, Luo Zheng was able to manage it. But under the pressure of the Space Law, it was expected that Luo Zheng wouldn't get used to it easily.</p>

  <p>As the noise in his eardrums grew louder and louder, Luo Zheng suddenly dropped to the ground. dozens of warriors sat cross-legged in the center of the main city.</p>

  <p>Every warrior participating in the Illusion Battlefield was fully prepared.</p>

  <p>Even their clans prepared a massive amount of supreme life vitality crystals and life vitality jades for them. In any case, this Illusion Battlefield was merely a projection� what they consumed was just as much of a projection instead of the real life vitality jades outside the space.</p>

  <p>In a battle between warriors, life vitality jade was a must, but they didn't dare use up too many of them. They would face many fights on the battlefield and the warriors would leave the life vitality jades for the most crucial moments. Therefore, they often rested in the main cities to absorb vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Buzz�</p>

  <p>With a sharp, ringing sound, a white mass of light appeared in the sky above the main city. Within this light, something dense plummeted to the ground.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng, of course.</p>

  <p>Because it was his first use of the Teleportation Token, he had no idea where it would take him in the main city. When he reached a certain distance, he attempted to stop himself from falling, but in the end, there was an outside, invisible force that restrained him and accelerated his fall.</p>

  <p>After the white light dissipated, he realized that he had already fallen right into the heart of the city. In an instant, Luo Zheng understood why he couldn't fly� every main city forbade warriors to exert any skills or treasures to fly. With his current strength, he had no means to get rid of the restraining force on him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The force of his fall was heavy, resounding through the whole area.</p>

  <p>When he got up from the ground, he saw that the surrounding warriors had their wide eyes fixed on him as if he were some kind of monster.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, they also began murmuring among themselves.</p>

  <p>"This guy� He fell from the sky!"</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? The main city forbids flying. After crossing the city walls, nobody should be able to fly. How could he fall from the sky above our city?"</p>

  <p>"Well, how else would you explain his appearance?"</p>

  <p>The warriors whispered to each other, wearing puzzled expressions.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng cared nothing for those words at all.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if the token could be taken out and used outside the Illusion Battlefield, but he wasn't keen on bringing it out in front of anyone else. For now, he merely appeared in the city� he decided he would let the people guess for themselves.</p>

  <p>"This is a city where human warriors gather."</p>

  <p>After examining his surroundings, Luo Zheng came to such a conclusion. This main city had the same architectural style as the human race's, after all, and everyone around him seemed to be a human.</p>

  <p>But whatever the race, it wasn't important to Luo Zheng. He chose to enter the city to challenge those fat sheep and obtain their Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>With that thought, Luo Zheng left the central zone and prepared to try his luck outside the city.</p>

  <p>But just as he was about to step outside, a warrior called to him, "Did you just arrive in this city?"</p>

  <p>Hearing the question, Luo Zheng stopped in his steps to turn around and look the warrior in the eye. "Yes. What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"We have rules in this city. Visitors have to register and surrender half of their Illusion Points to the city lord in order to leave safely," the warrior explained, giving Luo Zheng a careful look.</p>

  <p>"City lord? We are in the Illusion Battlefield. How could there be a city lord? As for my Illusion Points, they're inseparable. How can I just hand them over to the city lord?" The fact rather surprised Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure if the other cities have city lords," the warrior replied. "But we do. As for the payment of points, it's simple. If you let the city lord kill you once, you'll easily be surrendering half."</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng understood� he didn't know whether to laugh or to cry at the ridiculous thought. The term 'city lord' still took him aback. It seemed likely that the city lord was someone like Ezra, who relied on his influence and power to squeeze out points from others, more deserving warriors.</p>
