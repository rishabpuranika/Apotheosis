<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's identity had already been exposed in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>At least from the Soaring Snake Sword, they could easily tell where Luo Zheng came from.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Bearing race wouldn't attack the Taiyi Heaven Palace so soon, but that didn't mean that they wouldn't want to assault Luo Zheng on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Taiyi Heaven Palace's stronghold on Stage Fourteen was not difficult to find, and it was easy to observe the movements of their disciples.</p>

  <p>Thus, it would be effortless for the Bearing race to use the Other Shore creatures to attack him. "When will it end?" Feng Ge asked.</p>

  <p>"When they are afraid," Luo Zheng said as the corner of his lips curved up. He slowly got up and announced, "You step back. I'll fight this battle."</p>

  <p>After all, the sharp edge of the Ghost Scorpion's tail contained a highly toxic poison, and he didn't want Feng Ge to take the risk.</p>

  <p>In reality, he had indeed guessed the truth.</p>

  <p>When he and the other members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace entered the Desire World, the Jin Wu discovered them. Soon enough, the news quickly spread to the other races.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace was weak on Stage Fourteen, a complete opposite to the powerful forces on Stage Fourteen like the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>There were a total of two cities on Stage Fourteen, namely, the Myriad Spirits City and the Sky Water City. There were a large number of Other Shore creatures in these two cities. The Star Falcon race, which came from the same origin as the Jin Wu, was the leading force in the Sky Water City. The relationship between those two races was similar to that of the Separate Abyss race and the Abyss Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Although the Star Falcon race didn't exactly hold great power in the Myriad Spirits City, they were still a powerful Other Shore race, and it was still easy for them to deal with the likes of the Taiyi Heaven Palace--which appeared on the Other Shore in the form of souls.</p>

  <p>Three thousand feet away from the wooden building of the Taiyi Heaven Palace was an oval-shaped building with a terrace on top. More than a dozen Souls of Light stood on the terrace, which turned out to be from the Bearing race, the Jin Wu, and other two races.</p>

  <p>"At first, I was worried that if they directly retreated from the Other Shore, then we would have no way to deal with them," a Soul of Light said in a lazy voice.</p>

  <p>"Retreat from the Other Shore? That's impossible. Unless they don't plan to improve their cultivation, it's inevitable that they will enter the Other Shore," another Soul of Light sneered. It had two wings spreading on its back, which obviously told that it came from the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>"But I think these two people are quite confident about themselves. They don't have the slightest intention of giving in."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's actually a good thing. Overconfidence would bring them death.</p>

  <p>When they are dead, out task is finished..."</p>

  <p>The best way to kill Feng Ge and "Tianxing" was to do it on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race, the Jin Wu, and the other two races had undoubtedly chosen the simplest and most effective way to solve the problem.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng sauntered towards the Ghost Scorpion and said, "We have no grudge against each other. Someone must have entrusted you with the task of attacking me. Tell me who it is."</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion, however, thought of the two humans as mere fish on the chopping block, especially now that they had been tainted with the green smoke. It was impossible for them to escape.</p>

  <p>They were the ones who should have felt despair!</p>

  <p>In a normal case, Luo Zheng should have knelt down and begged for mercy, in hopes that he could spare his life.</p>

  <p>Yet, what he was currently doing was completely out of the Ghost Scorpion's expectation. Luo Zheng didn't feel anxious. In fact, he didn't seem to be so afraid of anything, and not even the slightest fear could be felt from him.</p>

  <p>"You killed my subordinates, of course you have to die. How could you say that I have no grudge against you?" the Ghost Scorpion smirked.</p>

  <p>No matter what happened, the Ghost Scorpion had ethics and those who had entrusted him with the task had given him a generous reward. So, why would he tell who was behind the scheme all just because of a word from Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>It was true that this human warrior would end up as a corpse soon, but there were a lot of spies in the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Ghost Scorpion clearly felt that there were many eyes staring at their position now.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a few huge creatures ran towards them from the other end of the path.</p>

  <p>They were mice as tall as an ox!</p>

  <p>In addition, they carried the Souls of Light of the Ear Mice on their backs!</p>

  <p>Squeak! "Master Ghost Scorpion! Please don't hurt him!" one of the Ear Mice shouted.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were creatures that could be seen almost anywhere.</p>

  <p>In the Desire World, their power could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The murine creatures in the Desire World in particular had quite a close relationship with the Ear Mice. They were a compelling force in the Myriad Spirits City, strong enough to contend against the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had also formed a close relationship with Luo Zheng on Stage Thirteen, and they also benefitted a lot from him in the Chaotic Source World. Besides, they also got a fair share of Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>After their spies which penetrated everywhere had gotten the news about the Taiyi Heaven Palace, they immediately jumped into action.</p>

  <p>Their efforts led them to where they were right now, with the purpose to convince the Ghost Scorpion not to harm Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't hurt him? That is impossible!" the Ghost Scorpion said flatly. "The mice from the southern area actually want to mess around! Who do they think they are?!"</p>

  <p>"Ear Mice, you'd better not provoke Master Ghost Scorpion. This is not something you can change!" The women of the Fragrant Butterfly race sneered.</p>

  <p>If it had been another time, the Ghost Scorpion might have given them some face.</p>

  <p>Given the special situation today, however, the Ghost Scorpion clearly wouldn't listen to them.</p>

  <p>"Master Ghost Scorpion, I think we could work something out. The price can be negotiated," one of the mice said.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice appeared to be very generous, and there were no doubts about their powerful financial capacity.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing we can talk about on this matter. You can leave now," the Ghost Scorpion coldly replied.</p>

  <p>"Master Ghost Scorpion..."</p>

  <p>Just as one Ear Mouse was still trying to persuade the Ghost Scorpion to change his mind, Luo Zheng interrupted them and said, "I appreciate your kindness, but I'll take care of this."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice who sat on the back of the giant mice looked at Luo Zheng in confusion.</p>

  <p>According to the information they had obtained before, Tianxing was powerful, but he might not be strong enough to fight against the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that? This little guy doesn't want you to intervene. Mice, you'd better get out of here," the Ghost Scorpion chuckled. He seemed to become more and more interested in Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng's next words, however, suddenly made his body stiff.</p>

  <p>"Let's continue our conversation about who ordered you to kill me. Now, tell me the truth, and I can give you a quick death," Luo Zheng said in a calm voice, as if he had already decided the fate of the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>The women of the Fragrant Butterfly race, who watched from behind, were all stunned.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice beside them were also dumbfounded, and even the giant mice that they sat on stared at Luo Zheng with eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>Only Feng Ge, who stood in front of the wooden building, looked rather indifferent.</p>

  <p>At that point, rays of light that were as thin as needles danced nimbly on her fingertips.</p>

  <p>Recently, she had gotten more and more proficient in using the Great Sanskrit Light. The light her fingers emitted looked ethereal, and could change into almost any shape according to her will. In addition to being able to turn it into clothes, she also wanted to try if she could turn it into a pair of wings.</p>
