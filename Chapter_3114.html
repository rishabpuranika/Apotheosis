  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Gant, is it difficult to control your position?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Gant was trying his best to draw Other Shore Power from his Other Shore Token and pour it into the great array, no matter how small his contribution was.</p>

  <p>"It's not difficult," Gant panted, beads of sweat streaming down his face.</p>

  <p>"But even if you take over my position, I'm afraid the array will still break soon!"</p>

  <p>The power of this array wasn't dependent on how strong their Other Shore Tokens were. Even with Luo Zheng's exceptionally powerful token, it wouldn't make a big difference.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a try," Luo Zheng said determinedly.</p>

  <p>Gant hesitated for a moment. Even though he felt like it wouldn't change the situation, he decided to let Luo Zheng take over. After all, Luo Zheng was no ordinary man.</p>

  <p>Although he had been following Luo Zheng for a while now, he had never felt that he had seen Luo Zheng's full potential. Even up until now, he had no idea how powerful Luo Zheng truly was.</p>

  <p>So now that Luo Zheng wanted to have a try, Gant was willing to let him.</p>

  <p>"Father, I can't hold on any longer," he said.</p>

  <p>Because he had used up the power of his Other Shore Token, it had become very dim. He knew it was in urgent need of divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Cailen, noticing Gant's exhaustion, said without hesitation, "I'll give you the divine crystals you'll need."</p>

  <p>As this was a dire situation, now was not the time to be stingy with resources.</p>

  <p>"Let my Flag Master do this. He is stronger than me!" Gant cried.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that, Cailen glanced at Luo Zheng dubiously.</p>

  <p>Cailen was well aware that Luo Zheng's strength far surpassed Gant's. However, even if Luo Zheng's Other Shore Token was powerful, it'd be nothing more than a measly contribution to the array. What was the point?</p>

  <p>However, Cailen didn't try to stop him. He was willing to try anything, given the desperate circumstances. "Alright. Gant, tell him what to do."</p>

  <p>Then Gant explained to Luo Zheng the method as to how to control the position in the array.</p>

  <p>The instructions weren't difficult to grasp. After Gant's brief explanation, Luo Zheng instantly understood what he needed to do.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's mastery of the method, Gant then withdrew from the green light, letting Luo Zheng enter it in his stead.</p>

  <p>The instant Gant had withdrawn fully from the position, he hurried over to Eira's side and cradled her in his arms. Although she was in a coma due to being seriously drained of blood power, she was still alive. Once she had broken off the blood array, some color returned to her face.</p>

  <p>As her face was no longer deathly pale, Gant let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Stepping into the green light, Luo Zheng felt his hairs stand on the back of his neck. He knew he had a connection with the entire array now.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master! Use my sword!"</p>

  <p>Gant said as he suddenly remembered Luo Zheng's Snow Sword hadn't been repaired yet.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you. I have my own sword." Luo Zheng smiled curtly. With a flick of his hand, a pale golden light flashed, condensing into the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Of course, this wasn't the real Soaring Snake Sword; this was just forged by Su Clan. However, it had no telltale signs of being fake, sharing the same details as the original one.</p>

  <p>But when Cailen and the other weapon refiners saw what sword Luo Zheng had summoned, they exchanged doubtful glances.</p>

  <p>Of course, they all knew the origin of the sword. In the Source World, it wasn't out of the norm for people to make copies of some ancient weapons, even those as special as the Grand Nature Treasures.</p>

  <p>However, these were considered collectibles rather than actual weapons for combat.</p>

  <p>Although they felt dubious, they didn't have the time to dwell on it. By this time, the third golden ball was thrown over by the winged woman.</p>

  <p>As the golden ball released the divine flames, Cailen knew he needed to concentrate. If anything went wrong and the divine flames broke through the array's defense, the people below would die.</p>

  <p>Even with Luo Zheng joining the array, the situation hadn't changed.</p>

  <p>Cailen was the one controlling the array plate. He struggled as he channeled the others' truth aura and Other Shore Power along their swords.</p>

  <p>However, he was exhausted. Unknowingly, a wisp of golden divine flame managed to burn down from a crack on the turtle shell.</p>

  <p>The deadly divine flame fell almost gracefully. Cailen's face fell as he realized where it was about to fall? right on Gant's head. "Gant! Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Gant looked up. Cradling Eira in his arms, he knew there was no way he would be able to move in time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body instinctively moved faster than his mind could think. In an instant, he had teleported right above Gant's head, blocking him from the divine flame. Once the fire touched Luo Zheng's flesh, his entire body erupted in flames, turning him into a ball of fire again. Gant quickly rolled on the ground, holding Eira tightly, successfully dodging the fire.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, the woman narrowed her eyes. She seemed to be a little upset that she had failed to kill anyone with that wisp of golden fire.</p>

  <p>Pretending to be calm, she tried to assume a stoic expression. However, she knew that the golden ball consumed a lot of divine flames; with her cultivation base, she could only release five golden balls at a time.</p>

  <p>As soon as the divine flames were used up, her strength would decline exponentially. In addition to this, divine flames couldn't be replenished with divine crystals.</p>

  <p>She knew that if she still couldn't destroy the array after releasing another two golden balls, she'd be cornered.</p>

  <p>For a moment, she hesitated.</p>

  <p>Just then, they heard a huge roar in the distance.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a golden column of light erupted from the ground and shot into the skies, as though a volcano had erupted. The earth trembled, causing smoke and dust to swirl into the air.</p>

  <p>Both parties looked towards the light in the distance, shocked at what they were witnessing.</p>

  <p>A golden figure suddenly appeared amidst the smoke, flying towards them at incredible speed.</p>

  <p>"Is the fight over already?" A faint, evil smile played on the lips of the winged woman and her eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>As the figure drew nearer, everyone could see that it held something in its hand.</p>

  <p>When the golden figure got close enough, they found it was another winged woman. She threw the pitch black thing she was holding onto the ground, shattering it into pieces. Everyone gasped in despair. Even though the object was broken and almost indiscernible, they knew what it was.</p>

  <p>"Sebert!"</p>

  <p>"Sebert is dead?"</p>

  <p>"There is no hope! We're doomed!"</p>

  <p>Satchel and Sebert were the best among the five-star Taiyi Guards.</p>

  <p>Seeing one of their most elite companions dead and disfigured by the hands of this woman, everyone despaired.</p>

  <p>The brothers had been their only hope. Now that Sebert was dead, they figured Satchel was in no better position.</p>

  <p>"Bella! You still haven't finished off this group of weapon refiners? You are so slow!" Mary said haughtily.</p>

  <p>Bella shook her head in frustration. "These weapon refiners have refined the Shade Stone. Their array is very strange. It seems to have a magic effect on the divine flames, rendering them useless!"</p>

  <p>"Really?" Mary frowned. She then turned to take a closer look at the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array. "Our sister's battle hasn't been settled yet. Let's work together and kill these humans before going to help her."</p>

  <p>As the weapon refiners overheard the talk between the winged women, their hearts sank.</p>

  <p>Even Cailen, who never gave up, couldn't see a way out of this.</p>

  <p>They could barely deal with one woman, let alone two.</p>

  <p>Cailen could feel the eyes of the other weapon refiners on him, as they expected him to come up with a solution. Just as he was about to buckle under the weight of this pressure, a voice interrupted his anxious thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Master Cailen, is this only a defense array?"</p>

  <p>Turning towards the voice, he replied, "Of course not. But..." A wry smile began to play at his lips.</p>

  <p>This array could turn into two forms. One was the Nine-Cube Black Armor, and the other was the Nine-Sword Strike.</p>

  <p>But when faced with this woman, they focused on its defensive function.</p>

  <p>They never thought to switch up the function of the array.</p>

  <p>Previously, they had been banking on Satchel and Sebert to come to the rescue. But with Sebert's death, that definitely wasn't happening.</p>

  <p>"Change the array," Luo Zheng said authoritatively. "Wouldn't you rather die fighting, than stand around and wait for death?"</p>

  <p>A determined look flashed through Cailen's eyes. Even the morale of the other weapon refiners was boosted.</p>

  <p>Cailen decided on the spot that he would hesitate no more. Focusing on the task at hand, he slightly twisted the array plate in his hand, returning the floating swords to their owners.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the columns of green light began to change shape. Almost instantly, the entire array transformed.</p>
