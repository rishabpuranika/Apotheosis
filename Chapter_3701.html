  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, King Manard pulled back the ropes that were tied to the side of the cave one by one, then tied up the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and some others with these ropes.</p>

  <p>Once everything was in place, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others went straight towards the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>As soon as they arrived at the Abstruse Energy World, they turned into many light dots and scattered around. Their bodies and their energy souls stepped into the Abstruse Energy State.</p>

  <p>Since these human heroes lived as long as Ziya Jiang, they shared the same amount of knowledge as him.</p>

  <p>Right now, however, they were as excited as children as they ran around and kept rubbing their hands.</p>

  <p>"Monkey, can you move out of my way and let me have a look first?"</p>

  <p>Houyi, who stood a little behind, asked. The monkey with a furry face turned his head and gave Houyi a ferocious stare.</p>

  <p>In turn, Houyi immediately fell silent and didn't press any further.</p>

  <p>The monkey was one of the strongest among the thirty-nine human heroes and his strength was on par with Fuxi's. Though Houyi had a way to restrain Emperor Charm's skill, he was relatively weak in terms of overall strength. After all, the monkey had taught him a hard lesson before.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others wandered around the Abstruse Energy World for a long time before they reluctantly left.</p>

  <p>"The information in the Abstruse Energy World is difficult to decipher," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with an unreadable expression after their trip to the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"I saw a mountain," said the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Snake Goddess understood Sanskrit words better than the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's strength was his analysis and deduction of many things.</p>

  <p>He wasn't good at deciphering Sanskrit words. "Why didn't I see it?" asked Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see it either…" Emperor Charm agreed as he shook his head. Only the Snake Goddess could see the mountain among the first group of warriors who entered the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"You are brilliant, Snake Goddess," Ziya Jiang praised.</p>

  <p>"Although there is no concept of distance in the Abstruse Energy World, the mountain is the easiest to find. I didn't recognize the mountain from the starlight until many years later. I also got the Nirvana Clay from there. I didn't expect that you'd see the mountain the first time you entered!" he enthused.</p>

  <p>"I just saw the shadow of the mountain," the Snake Goddess said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That's also very rare," Ziya Jiang commented.</p>

  <p>At that point, the Primeval Lord of Heaven untied the rope around his body and gave it to the person behind him.</p>

  <p>Then, they entered and came out one after another. It turned out that the Abstruse Energy World was just a small test for them.</p>

  <p>Those who were good at deciphering Sanskrit words could adapt much faster in the Abstruse Energy World. After all, they could also accurately describe what they saw and felt.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, those who found it difficult to understand Sanskrit words couldn't adapt to the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>For instance, Houyi returned from the Abstruse Energy World in a daze, completely unaware of the situation. It took him a long time to recover from his muddled mind.</p>

  <p>Ziya Jiang was a little disappointed at their performance.</p>

  <p>Back then, these heroes were either on the same level as him or on a higher level when it came to cultivation and talent.</p>

  <p>He had been in the Abstruse Energy World for countless years, but he still couldn't find anything meaningful. In the end, he just dived into that mountain and dug out some mud.</p>

  <p>He believed if any of them could see through the rules of the Abstruse Energy World, they might be even able to unravel the Abstruse Energy World's secrets!</p>

  <p>However, even the most talented Snake Goddess could only see the shadow of the mountain. That was still far from Ziya Jiang's expectations.</p>

  <p>When the last group entered the world, Zheng stepped forward and said,</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya, there is another person who wants to enter the Abstruse Energy World."</p>

  <p>Ziya Jiang was very grateful to Zheng for bringing his master in person with him. Thus, he kindly asked, "Who do you want to send to the Abstruse Energy World?"</p>

  <p>"It is my son," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>A smile graced Ziya's face. "No problem. You are free to show him something new. Please, go ahead!" he said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's son, Geoffrey, was already prepared as he waited in his father's inner world.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit already had an idea after he had seen the Abstruse Energy World last time. He and No. 9527 both agreed that Geoffrey was very suitable to enter the Abstruse Energy World because he could decipher Sanskrit words very quickly.</p>

  <p>If only Zheng hadn't been very busy after he had returned from the Chaotic Source World last time, the Regal Jade Spirit would have urged him to go to the Deleting Space again.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Geoffrey also became interested in the Abstruse Energy World when the Regal Jade Spirit had described it to him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey felt a strong gravitational force on him. His body spun, and then he landed in the small cave.</p>

  <p>"Father, Grandpa Primeval, Brother Monkey..."</p>

  <p>The moment he came out, he greeted all the human heroes one by one.</p>

  <p>"What are you calling them?" Zheng asked with a frown. It was not a big deal to call the Primeval Lord of Heaven as grandpa, but he even called Wukong Sun as brother.</p>

  <p>That was unreasonable and disrespectful!</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? That is what I call them in your inner world," Geoffrey said and shrugged.</p>

  <p>After this group of "outsiders" came to his father's inner world, he became quite familiar with them. He could even talk a little to Wukong Sun, who was known for being unapproachable.</p>

  <p>"We have lived for so many years. Seniority means nothing for us," the Snake Goddess said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Ordinary mortals can't live for more than a hundred years, so they pay attention to such things..." Geoffrey scowled.</p>

  <p>"Should I call you dad then?" asked Zheng. In return, Geoffrey only pursed his lips as he didn't know how to respond.</p>

  <p>Then, he shifted his attention to the outside of the cave.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Abstruse Energy World my master has told me about? It's interesting!" he exclaimed. His gaze travelled to the floating light dots.</p>

  <p>Just then, Ziya handed the rope to Geoffrey and said, "This world is very wonderful. You'll know when you get in."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey took the rope and after he had tied it to him, he jumped out of the cave.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>He had turned into many light dots and quickly scattered into the distance.</p>

  <p>Those who entered the Abstruse Energy World for the first time couldn't locate themselves at all.</p>

  <p>They didn't know where they were but lost all senses of distance, direction, time, and vision. Everything had changed, and they also couldn't find the cave where they could return to the chaos. Thus, they needed to tie ropes around their bodies.</p>

  <p>"Those light dots..."</p>

  <p>For Zheng, those numerous light dots were meaningless.</p>

  <p>However, Geoffrey had already understood what they meant in a single glance.</p>

  <p>"These light dots are a mountain..."</p>

  <p>"It's really interesting. I can land on this mountain!"</p>

  <p>The mountain itself was also made up of light dots, and the Snake Goddess also saw it clearly the first time she arrived. It was already quite an impressive talent to have, but Geoffrey went further and stood straight on the mountain.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey had landed, he looked around again.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the light dots had a special meaning to each other.</p>

  <p>Some light dots clumped together and formed a large rock, while some turned into a swamp. Ziya Jiang had dug out the Nirvana Clay from the swamp before.</p>

  <p>Still, Geoffrey wasn't interested in those things. He wanted to go further.</p>
