<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman at the Internal Elixir Realm started registering Luo Zheng's information.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been a bit worried, afraid that the woman would ask him where he came from. He had discussed this with Francis before and they decided that Luo Luo Zheng should fabricate a new identity.</p>

  <p>Francis told Luo Luo Zheng not to worry. According to him, the divine kingdoms didn't care where the warriors came from and would treat them as independent warriors.</p>

  <p>After all, to the four divine kingdoms, it wasn't important where the warriors came from as long as they had enough strength to obtain the resources from within the Feather Holy Sea. Once those resources were gathered, the divine kingdoms would receive a portion of them and that was what mattered to them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the four divine kingdoms were surrounded by the sea. In tens of thousands of years, there had been few visitors from other continents.</p>

  <p>As a result, in the eyes of the emperors of the four divine kingdoms, every warrior in their territories would belong to their respective divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng answered each question without hesitation until the woman asked for his name. With a quick thought, he answered, "My name is Tianxing Luo."</p>

  <p>His real name,  Luo Luo Zheng Luo, wasn't suitable for him to travel in the divine kingdoms. He didn't want the Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom to recognize him by his name.</p>

  <p>After registration, the woman smiled politely at Luo Luo Zheng. She sealed all the information in a bamboo token and handed it to him. "The first round of the exam is scheduled in three days. On that day, all the warriors of this martial house and the independent warriors will gather. I hope you will perform well!"</p>

  <p>'How kind!' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself, though he knew she was being sarcastic. In her mind, this young man was a nobody and destined to fail in the first round.</p>

  <p>The competition in the divine kingdoms was rather fierce.</p>

  <p>There were only fifty licenses in the Jade Martial House, which meant that all warriors were fighting for fifty Harlen Tokens.</p>

  <p>There were nearly six hundred warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm alone fighting for the Harlen Tokens in the Jade Martial House. Most of these warriors were at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, which was much higher than the cultivation of this young man standing in front of her. Not to mention, the warriors trained by the Jade Martial House were much stronger than the independent warriors.</p>

  <p>There were also princes who participated in the contest fighting for the licenses. Randy was one of them, and he was certain he would be able to obtain a Harlen Token.</p>

  <p>Besides, there were two or three hundred independent warriors like Luo Luo Zheng that signed up for the exam, and most of them were at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>The young man in front of her seemed to have a good foundation and was already at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. At the age of twenty, this was an impressive achievement, but it was still too early for him to obtain the Harlen Token.</p>

  <p>The woman had no bad feelings towards Luo Luo Zheng. In fact, she was sympathetic to him. She couldn't help showing her true thoughts through her humble smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at her.</p>

  <p>He knew what she was thinking, but he did not care about her opinion.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her, grabbed the bamboo token and hid it in his pocket before leaving the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Luo Luo Zheng entered the Jade Martial House again. He showed the bamboo token at the entrance, and an escort privately guided him inside the martial house.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng saw a large square and most of the warriors were already present.</p>

  <p>Each warrior was emitting the Mu Ning of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked around and his gaze stopped at the center of the square where he saw warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. They were a small group of three.</p>

  <p>'The divine kingdoms live up to their reputation. There are three warriors at the Soul Sea Realm in this martial house alone. It is possible that there are more in the Jade Martial House, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>The Jade Martial House was considered a sixth-grade sect. If it didn't belong to the Harlen Divine Kingdom, it could be considered a sacred place.</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place on the Sea God Continent was a six-grade sacred place, and there were only three warriors at the Soul Sea Realm in the sacred place. For this reason, the Jade Martial House could be considered a sixth-grade sacred place as it also had three warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. The Jade Martial House was a subsidiary of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, and the four divine kingdoms had countless mighty warriors.</p>

  <p>No wonder after all these years, they considered the Central Region a piece of barren land and very few warriors of the divine kingdoms were willing to go to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Thinking back, when Luo Luo Zheng had met the Holy Maiden and the prince of York Divine Kingdom in Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, they had shown great disdain for the Central Region. Now Luo Luo Zheng understood their arrogance. The four divine kingdoms were indeed strong.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Luo Zheng did not cower. He was ready.</p>

  <p>His mentality was incomparably calm and strong. He knew that this path of cultivation was arduous and would make him feel miserable; he had no choice but to advance forward. This was his destiny.</p>

  <p>After entering the square, Luo Luo Zheng was instructed to wait and was left alone.</p>

  <p>About a thousand warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were standing around the square. They were all mighty warriors and were all observing each other. There were no signs of hostility on their faces.</p>

  <p>Instead, most of them looked calm and relaxed.</p>

  <p>Revealing hostility towards others would only bring unnecessary trouble.</p>

  <p>Only the weak would pay close attention to others all day long. The mighty warriors simply didn't care about the others and were focused on themselves.</p>

  <p>But the atmosphere was still somewhat heavy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was standing in a corner with his hands behind his back, observing his surroundings. A knowing smile appeared on his face when he saw a familiar face.</p>

  <p>At first, he felt someone staring at him. Then, he turned his head and that was when he saw Randy.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, even after being crowned a Lord, Randy still had to participate in the examination and compete for the Harlen Token with all his might.</p>

  <p>Francis' words were true. You could be the prince of one of the four divine kingdoms, but you wouldn't receive special treatment. You would be treated just as a common mighty warrior and have to rely on your skills to fight and pass the examination.</p>

  <p>Actually this was understandable. How could an emperor control a great divine kingdom without cultivating the proper skills? In the end, an emperor had to rely on his own strength.</p>

  <p>If the princes and princesses of the divine kingdoms were too lazy to cultivate simply because their father was the emperor, none of them would be able to inherit the throne after the death of their father. Perhaps the position would be taken away by the other powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the emperors of the four divine kingdoms would cultivate their sons and daughters and make sure they enter the Soul Sea Realm. Moreover, these princes and princesses needed to overpower the other warriors at the Soul Sea Realm so that they could take over their position and rule the divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng noticed Randy was staring back at him so he smiled politely.</p>

  <p>Randy merely glanced coldly at Luo Luo Zheng before shifting his gaze elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Soon all of the candidates had arrived and gathered on the square. A steward entered the square and handed over a list to one of the three warriors at the Soul Sea Realm in charge of the assessment. The warrior looked at the list and said, "The preliminary assessment to fight for the Harlen Tokens has begun. This round is the simplest. Everyone will enter the square in batches, and with your own strength, you have to push the others out of the red circle. You can fight but you can't kill anyone.</p>

  <p>Violators will be severely punished!"</p>

  <p>As the warrior spoke, he stretched out his hand and lightly patted the ground. Multicolored patterns appeared on the ground in the center of the square.</p>

  <p>The ground of the square was made of an unknown metal and looked rather heavy. Its outermost layer of decorative patterns had a red circle arranged around it.</p>

  <p>After hearing the rules announced by the warrior, all the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm remained quiet and didn't move.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was suddenly taken back to his first day at the Cloud Sect. He thought about all the disciples who immediately started chatting with each other as soon as they heard about the exam. He felt quite nostalgic.</p>

  <p>Now he was at a whole other level competing against the strongest. The over a thousand warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in front of him had different qualities. There were a few divine-level talents like Luo Luo Zheng and Randy who had stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm at such a young age, but most of the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were not young. Their age ranged from tens to hundreds of years old.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they were not newbies who had just entered the martial world and got excited about everything.</p>

  <p>The mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm announced the list of candidates in the first round.</p>

  <p>"Thirty warriors will participate in the first round. From these thirty warriors, only three will remain. In other words, 90% will be eliminated," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes in introspection while listening attentively to him.</p>

  <p>He finished reciting the names very quickly, and Luo Luo Zheng didn't hear his name "Tianxing Luo." He wasn't included in the first round.</p>

  <p>The disadvantage of being called in the first round was that the warriors were not familiar with the rules and environment. The ones left out could observe the rules first and be on their guard when they came to fight.</p>

  <p>However, not being aware of the rules could bring advantages to the smartest warriors who knew how to use it to their favor.</p>

  <p>Soon, thirty warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm entered the stage at the same time and stood within the red circle in the center of the square.</p>

  <p>The warriors were eager to begin the examination. The preliminary assessment was very important because the eliminated participants would be out of the competition and could no longer fight for the Harlen Tokens. As a warrior of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, everyone knew the importance of the Harlen Tokens.</p>
