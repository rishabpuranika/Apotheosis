<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though Freya had already ascended to the Upper World, she wasn't exactly an ambitious person.</p>

  <p>She didn't even recognize the rare, invaluable treasures found within the cave. She learned from the discussions of others that the tiny World Tree seed at the top of the cave was an extraordinary object.</p>

  <p>However, she did not target this tree seed, but instead focused on the side of the cave, where there was an ice lotus emitting a cold Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>She mainly cultivated the Ice Law. This ice lotus would be useful to her, but she wasn't sure if she could do it. After all, not all martial artists that had entered the wind tunnels would be able to obtain what they wanted.</p>

  <p>Some of them came out empty-handed.</p>

  <p>Seeing Freya's expression, Luo Luo Zheng smiled and encouraged her, "Try your best! You can do it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help her much after all.</p>

  <p>Freya nodded at this. She felt encouraged and was feeling a bit more confident now. "Thank you! I'll try my best!"</p>

  <p>She stretched out her arms, releasing a stream of cold air. Her entire body was like a kite as she flew along a wind tunnel.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because she was a little flustered. As she was floating in the wind tunnel, her petite body continuously twirled. After a long while, she finally managed to stabilize her body.</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows were knitted together, completely focused. She understood that although this ice lotus was valuable, it wasn't a life-and-death thing for her. However, when she thought that Luo Luo Zheng was watching her from behind, she took it more seriously. She'd decided that she was going to get that ice lotus.</p>

  <p>"Still another hundred feet."</p>

  <p>As Freya was getting closer and closer to the ice lotus, her expression became increasingly solemn. Although these wind tunnels didn't intersect with each other, the wind still caused her to sway back and forth every now and then.</p>

  <p>"Here it is!"</p>

  <p>Freya stretched out her hand when she saw that the ice lotus was just inches away from her now. Just as she was about to reach for the ice lotus, her body was suddenly dragged towards the opposite side by the violent and strong wind. Her hand was still reaching for the ice lotus.</p>

  <p>She gritted her teeth as an icy blue ribbon appeared in her hand, sweeping towards the ice lotus. As the ice lotus was pulled by the ribbon, an extremely cold Mu Ning burst forth. Freya's face brightened as she finally got the ice lotus.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Soon she was standing on the other side of the cave. She held the small ice lotus and examined it for a while. There were seven seeds in the ice lotus which was naturally formed from the Ice Law. Just swallowing these lotus seeds would do wonders for her.</p>

  <p>She gazed at the lotus in her hands before raising her head to smile at Luo Luo Zheng who was standing opposite of her.</p>

  <p>Just then, a tall figure walked towards her. It was an ogre martial artist.</p>

  <p>He looked down at Freya, an evil grin on his face. "Ten life vitality jades, and the ice lotus is mine."</p>

  <p>Freya's expression shifted.</p>

  <p>She worked so hard for this. Ten life vitality jades were nothing compared to that. In addition to that, she loved the ice lotus so much that she wasn't willing to sell it at all.</p>

  <p>But the bidder was a Spirit Supreme Realm martial artist. In terms of both cultivation and strength, he was much stronger than Freya.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist despised Freya. Before she could respond, he took out ten life vitality jades and threw them on the ground. Then, he stretched out his fan-sized hand and demanded, "Give the ice lotus to me!"</p>

  <p>Freya pursed her lips, her eyes showing a trace of stubbornness. She took two steps back.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to fight, but if you don't understand..." The ogre martial artist didn't expect that Freya would dare to refuse. He was about to make a move.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, another burly figure appeared in front of Freya. It was Lincoln who had also entered the cave.</p>

  <p>Freya had followed Luo Luo Zheng all the way here. Lincoln couldn't just stand by and watch Freya get treated like this without doing anything.</p>

  <p>As Lincoln stood in front of Freya, all of the other ogre martial artists surrounded them. They were like small mountains as they stood in front of the two.</p>

  <p>On this side of the cave, there were also many human martial artists.</p>

  <p>Besides Adrian and Ab, there were the talented martial artists of the Magnolia Sacred Place. They all just stood by and watched the drama unfold as Freya and Lincoln weren't members of the Magnolia Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The martial artists of the Demon Night wouldn't get themselves involved in this kind of thing either.</p>

  <p>Lincoln looked very calm and the Wrath of the Ocean on his forehead was shining with a faint cyan light. He was at the later stage of the Soul Sea Realm, so it wouldn't be too difficult for him to defeat the Spirit Supreme Realm martial artists. However, over ten ogre martial artists at the Spirit Supreme Realm weren't easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>"You little brat! If you know what's good for you, you're going to give me that ice lotus. Do you really want to lose your life for this?" the ogre martial artist sneered.</p>

  <p>Lincoln didn't move out of the way. He was a decisive killer. The ogre martial artist's words didn't deter him at all. He was scheming on how he would counterattack once his opponent attacked.</p>

  <p>Freya turned pale with fear. She hesitated as she looked at the ice lotus in her hand. Suddenly, she heard a voice. Then, her eyes flashed and she said, "You're right. I don't want to die for this. I'm giving it up."</p>

  <p>A puzzled expression appeared on Lincoln's face. When he turned his head, he saw Luo Luo Zheng standing on a stone platform across from him. His expression was calm but Lincoln could tell that something else was going on.</p>

  <p>That was how he figured that he didn't need to do anything to help, so he stepped aside. The ogre martial artist received the ice lotus with a smile and said with satisfaction, "Human girl, you are very smart."</p>

  <p>Freya smiled gleefully. However, the ogre martial artists didn't know that she wasn't smiling at them. She was smiling because she heard Luo Luo Zheng say,</p>

  <p>"Give the ice lotus to them. I'll deal with them later."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was standing on the stone platform, the expression in his eyes as calm as water. The ogre martial artists always had no idea what Luo Luo Zheng was planning. He wasn't planning on doing anything right away so he asked Freya to stand by for a while.</p>

  <p>Now, his target was the World Tree seed.</p>

  <p>Following Xun's directions, Luo Luo Zheng chose the 72nd stone platform. The wind tunnel underneath it was relatively remote.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had observed that no martial artist had chosen this wind tunnel until now. The reason was simple: when the Demon Night blonde had her test here using the scented mist, the wind in the tunnel flew downwards to the bottom of the cave.</p>

  <p>Everyone's goal was to go up, so no one would choose to go down such a wind tunnel.</p>

  <p>However, since Xun had asked him to choose this tunnel, he had no choice but to follow.</p>

  <p>Inside the cave, there were only two or three martial artists that didn't follow the wind to the other side. But by now, Luo Luo Zheng had gotten everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have chosen the most unreliable tunnel."</p>

  <p>"It's useless. Some people like to think outside of the box, but the wind in that tunnel goes down all the way. He doesn't even have the slightest chance."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I think so too."</p>

  <p>They discussed amongst themselves as they watched Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had finished preparing, he took a step on the stone platform and his entire body merged with the fierce wind that was blowing out from the tunnel.</p>

  <p>Whir! Whir! Whir!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flew down against the wind.</p>

  <p>His body kept descending at an angle of 90 degrees.</p>

  <p>However, after he descended for over two hundred feet, he maintained a certain angle and slowly moved upward.</p>

  <p>With the fast speed of the wind, Luo Luo Zheng was able to hover to the right of the cave in less than three seconds.</p>

  <p>"To the left!" Xun's cold and brisk voice came through.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng quickly hit the stalagmite on the left, and then he charged out of the tunnel and went around to another one.</p>
