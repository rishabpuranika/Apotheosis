<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The blood of Eastern Emperor Taiyi ran through all the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Their status rested on a combination of blood, talent, and strength.</p>

  <p>Chance was slightly inferior to Feng Ge in terms of talent, but he had been strong enough to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Those who had entered the Land of Sword Grief didn't take the ordinary disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace seriously. Moreover, Xun, Liusu, and Nelly weren't from the direct line of the Phoenix Palace, so Chance thought it wouldn't really matter if he killed them.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, Chance only knew that he was the core disciple of a certain mountain.</p>

  <p>But whichever mountain Zheng was from, Chance decided it didn't matter. He wasn't afraid of Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Chance was unaware of the degree to which Zheng had refrained from showing his true power in the Phoenix Palace. Zheng had restrained himself because he didn't want to make trouble. Although Ahmad had almost killed Xun, Zheng didn't take revenge.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng heard Chance's words, anger flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked proud and scornful.</p>

  <p>They thought it was unforgivably bold for an outsider like Zheng to interfere in the affairs of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Regardless of how powerful Zheng was, he was no match for him. He had crushed Ahmad's sword, but now that Chance was here, he was about to be defeated.</p>

  <p>Ahmed became more arrogant with his brother's support. He said to Zheng,</p>

  <p>"You are a mere disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace. How dare you come here to flaunt your prowess. Is it because the Phoenix Palace has always kept a low profile?"</p>

  <p>The other disciples nodded vigorously, agreeing with Ahmed. "Indeed!</p>

  <p>What a display of rudeness and arrogance!"</p>

  <p>"No one is allowed to come to the Phoenix Palace without permission."</p>

  <p>The direct descendants present had felt more secure since Chance arrived.</p>

  <p>They felt that with Chance, they were superior to Zheng.</p>

  <p>A few of them recognized Zheng from his fight with Feng Ge in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. But since Feng Ge had not yet reached the Chaotic Source Realm, they believed she was much weaker than Chance.</p>

  <p>Xun, Liusu, and Nelly looked upset. Nelly tugged at Zheng's sleeve and said, "Let's go."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't move. He knew that even if he had been inclined to leave, the disciples of the Phoenix Palace wouldn't let him go without a fight. So he gently removed Nelly's hand and turned to Chance. Calmly he said, "You're right. I do have a death wish. Let's fight."</p>

  <p>Chance lifted a long black eyebrow in surprise.</p>

  <p>Given Zheng's cultivation base, he should have understood the importance of reaching the Chaotic Source Realm, as Chance had done. Moreover, the Chaotic Source World was about to open soon. Zheng clearly knew that Chance was powerful enough to beat him. And yet, Zheng dared to challenge him to a fight. Either he was an idiot or he had something up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"You want a fight?" Chance asked, laughing as though Zheng had told a very funny joke. "What makes you think I'd even bother? You're not qualified to fight me."</p>

  <p>The other Phoenix Palace disciples joined in Chance's laughter.</p>

  <p>They were all familiar with the vast difference in the level of strength between the warriors who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm and those who had not. Chance was stronger than anyone present, including Zheng. But apparently Zheng didn't understand that. They thought he was being ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Chance, teach him a lesson," one of the disciples called out.</p>

  <p>"Right! Show him he's making a mistake!"</p>

  <p>"Make him sorry he ever came here!"</p>

  <p>Zheng scowled. His eyes had narrowed dangerously at the repeated taunts of the disciples. He turned to Xun, Liusu, and Nelly, and said quietly to them, "Back off. Give me some space."</p>

  <p>"Zheng, what are you planning?" Xun murmured, looking concerned.</p>

  <p>Like everyone else, the three women had heard of the incredible strength of the warriors who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. The bodies and souls of such warriors had been greatly enhanced. Indeed, it could be argued that they had transformed altogether into a different, stronger being.</p>

  <p>Xun, Liusu, and Nelly had always trusted in Zheng's strength. But this wasn't the divine land. It was the Source World, and here, there were plenty of mighty warriors from various sects and races.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw her expression and smiled to ease her fear. "Don't worry, all right?"</p>

  <p>Xun nodded and retreated with Liusu and Nelly. Zheng's confidence was a relief. It renewed their faith in his strength.</p>

  <p>At a gesture from Chance, Ahmad and the other direct descendants of Phoenix Palace also stepped back. Zheng and Chance stood alone in the middle of a wide, empty space.</p>

  <p>Since he had reached the Chaotic Source Realm, Chance had never bothered to fight anyone who hadn't. In his opinion, the warriors at the Other Shore Realm were all beneath him, and it would be demeaning to fight them. But today, for his brother's sake, he would set that aside and teach Zheng a lesson.</p>

  <p>He was absolutely confident in his own superiority. He thought he'd be able to beat Zheng within seconds.</p>

  <p>"Let's get this over with," he said, sneering. "It will be a shame if anyone in the Land of Sword Grief realizes that I'm fighting with a junior like you."</p>

  <p>Without further ado, he lunged forward and threw a punch at Zheng.</p>

  <p>After undergoing the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, his fist was a weapon in itself, a fore to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>The power behind his punch was as explosive as a volcanic eruption.</p>

  <p>Indeed, that single punch should be enough to kill Zheng if it landed.</p>

  <p>Chance expected Zheng to try to dodge the punch, and readied himself to strike again. To his astonishment, however, Zheng just stood there without budging.</p>

  <p>Chance felt a stab of confusion. Why was this man so confident? Was there something he hadn't seen? Something that made Zheng more dangerous than he seemed?</p>

  <p>Chance's arm drove forward. In response, Zheng lifted his hand to grasp his fist. The Shade Stone liquid surged in Zheng's body, and his spine and arm turned dark.</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace chattered to each other with excitement and anticipation, wondering what would happen next.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't he know how terrifying a warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm is?"</p>

  <p>"That one punch is enough to kill him if it's a direct hit!"</p>

  <p>"He's trying to block the punch with his bare hand! He's crazy!"</p>

  <p>Everyone stared with wide eyes as Chance's fist smashed into Zheng's palm.</p>

  <p>There was a crisp, thunderous clapping sound.</p>

  <p>The disciples closed their eyes and raised their hands instinctively to protect their ears at the deafening boom of the impact.</p>

  <p>The power of the collision spread outwards in all direction, tearing through everything in its way. The onlookers let out cries of pain. They felt as though the front of their bodies had been slapped with something hot and hard.</p>

  <p>As the sound ceased and the shock wave of the impact passed, they cautiously opened their eyes and looked at the two fighters. Zheng was still standing, holding Chance's fist firmly in one outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>Chance's face was distorted with shock.</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned at him. "Now will you take this seriously? Draw your sword!"</p>

  <p>He shoved Chance backwards, releasing his fist. Chance staggered several steps backwards, still looking stunned.</p>

  <p>His astonishment was mirrored in the faces of the direct descendants of Phoenix Palace, who had fully expected Zheng to be killed by the full force of Chance's blow. The disciples realized that they and Chance had underestimated Zheng.</p>

  <p>Chance couldn't believe what had just happened. He had used over nine hundred divine megatons of the Other Shore Power in his punch. There was no way an inferior like Zheng could have resisted that. But somehow, Zheng had not only blocked the punch, but had also done so with seeming ease.</p>

  <p>Chance would never have admitted it, but he felt a small tremor of fear. He had landed a killing blow but Zheng had not been injured in the slightest. He realized that although Zheng hadn't been through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, he also had extraordinary physical strength and must be taken seriously.</p>

  <p>But Chance did not let any of his thoughts show on his face. "Draw my sword? No need!" he said grandly. He chuckled and rushed towards Zheng again.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power flowed continuously from his cinnabar field. This time, he used over a thousand divine megatons of force. This was the limit of the physical body below the Chaotic Source Realm. Chance himself wouldn't be able to withstand such an attack, and neither would Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was a series of booming sounds as he landed one punch after another.</p>

  <p>Again, the onlookers protected their eyes and ears.</p>

  <p>Chance summoned all his raging power, and each blow had the power to split mountains and part seas.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained deadly calm. He raised both arms to meet Chance's fists. He matched him in speed and strength, managing to deflect every single blow.</p>

  <p>In seconds, Chance had thrown at least ten punches, and Zheng blocked every single one without flinching.</p>
