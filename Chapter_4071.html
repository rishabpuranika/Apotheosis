  <p>
</p>

  <p>A hexagonal pattern appeared in the eyeball.</p>

  <p>The power transmitted from the eyeball became stronger and stronger as circles of golden light bloomed within the pattern.</p>

  <p>Decker's face turned red after being pressed this way, his body creaking dangerously. Sawyer and Thurston were in similar situations. If his strength continued to increase, it would crush their bodies.</p>

  <p>Zheng could bear a power ten times stronger than what Sawyer, Thurston, and Decker could bear.</p>

  <p>His physical body had been strengthened greatly, and it had far exceeded that of most creatures in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>He didn't move even under the pressure of such a powerful force.</p>

  <p>"Master Eye Spirit, I'm going to kill him!"</p>

  <p>Gavyn said, seeing that the Eye Spirit had already controlled Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the moment the six wings of the Holy Wings Armor were unfurled, Zheng, who was at the foot of the Ghost Mountain, suddenly shook his body and stretched his hands to his sides.</p>

  <p>The steel cage that the Eye Spirit had made shattered.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The hexagonal pattern in the Eye Spirit's eyeball also dissipated.</p>

  <p>Zheng then turned to the people around him and ordered, "You go in first".</p>

  <p>Sawyer, Thurston, and Decker broke free from the huge pressure, panting, their faces red.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's words, Sawyer was the first to put the glazed sheet on the stone door. The door spun quickly and pushed him into the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Thurston and Decker followed close behind.</p>

  <p>Zheng glared at the Eye Spirit, and then put the glazed sheet on the stone door.</p>

  <p>And as the door revolved, he disappeared from before the door.</p>

  <p>"He runs so fast!" Claire said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"There is no other way out in the Ghost Mountain. He can't escape," the Eye Spirit said calmly. "Moreover, the power of my eyeball that I just used has reached its limit."</p>

  <p>"You can force him to stay using your..." Gavyn cut in.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit cast a cold glance at Gavyn and said, "I don't need your advice on what kind of theurgy I use!"</p>

  <p>Gavin immediately shut up, noticing the displeasure in the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Red Demons, lead the way!" the Eye Spirit ordered again.</p>

  <p>How dare Tate disobey him!</p>

  <p>He then led the members of his race to walk down the mountain and they finally arrived in front of the monkey statues.</p>

  <p>"Master Eye Spirit, I'll help you exchange for the thing you need to enter the Ghost Mountain," said Tate, his tone friendly.</p>

  <p>"No need."</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit walked forward and a glazed sheet appeared in the eyeball.</p>

  <p>This glazed sheet was also made of the Arcanum. He stuffed it into the mouth of the monkey statue and stepped back. The statue chewed it for a while. He then got another glazed sheet that he'd use to enter the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Looks like you don't lack Arcanum," said Murdock, the leader of the Grand Mighty race.</p>

  <p>"As the leader of the Element Spirit Civilization, Master Eye Spirit doesn't lack in these things," Tate said.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap. Go ahead. Enter the Ghost Mountain!" Claire said, throwing them a disapproving glance.</p>

  <p>"Do we need to enter the Ghost Mountain too?" Murdock exclaimed, pretending to be surprised.</p>

  <p>"We've been to the Ghost Mountain just a while ago. We don't need to go there again, do we?" Tate said nervously, unable to refuse outright.</p>

  <p>The aboriginals of the Night View Island weren't stupid.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization was much more powerful than other races.</p>

  <p>The only value that the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race held was to provide Arcana for the Element Spirit Civilization. But now they had lost all value now that the Element Spirit Civilization didn't need their Arcana.</p>

  <p>They were nobodies now.</p>

  <p>It must have been significant purpose if the Element Spirit Civilization had deigned to come.</p>

  <p>Now, there was basically no possibility that these nobodies would survive.</p>

  <p>Tate and Murdock didn't want to let the members of their races get involved in this trouble.</p>

  <p>"Get in." Claire's voice became colder, a ray of red light flashing on her fingertip and the temperature quickly rising.</p>

  <p>Tate and Murdock looked at each other, finding helplessness in the other's eyes. They could only lead the members of their races to exchange for the glazed sheets and enter the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Once the Snake Goddess and the other warriors had entered the Ghost Mountain, they found that Zheng and the rest hadn't entered yet. So they waited at the entrance, not budging from their spot.</p>

  <p>The interior of the Ghost Mountain was pretty simple.</p>

  <p>After entering through the stone door, they found an open space just a few feet from the door. It was pitch-dark.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are Zheng and the others doing? Why haven't they come in yet?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi was confused.</p>

  <p>After all, they were able to pass through the stone door in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>After a while, they saw Decker, Thurston, and Sawyer passing through the stone door one after the other, panic written large on their faces.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"A big eye!" Decker said fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Big eye?"</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others were confused. The door turned again, and Zheng came in. "It's the Eye Spirit. They have come."</p>

  <p>Everyone's expressions shifted at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>They had known that the Element Spirit Civilization would enter the Night View Island, but they hadn't expected the Eye Spirit to come in person.</p>

  <p>Being blocked in the Ghost Mountain by the Eye Spirit meant that they would have no way to escape.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other exit in the Ghost Mountain?" King Ieuan asked. It wanted to escape as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Bacchus's face darkened as he heard the conversation and understood that a strong enemy was coming for them. He shook his head and said, "Yes.</p>

  <p>There is an identical stone door at the back of the Ghost Mountain."</p>

  <p>"Where does the stone door lead to?" King Ieuan squeaked, hope glimmering in its eyes.</p>

  <p>"It leads to the void, and all the creatures that enter the void will disappear," answered Bacchus. . King Ieuan was surprised into speechlessness.</p>

  <p>It knew that the void was filled with Void Dust and that the creatures that approached the Void Dust would be devoured.</p>

  <p>"How strong is the Eye Spirit you just mentioned?" Bacchus asked.</p>

  <p>According to Bacchus, Zheng and his group were very powerful. Even without the Holy Stones, their combat strength was still terrifying.</p>

  <p>"He is powerful enough to dominate the entire Three Purities Stage," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>This answer silenced Bacchus. All these people from the outside were supernormal!</p>

  <p>"Let's look for the human beings in the Ghost Mountain," Zheng said. "This is probably the only way."</p>

  <p>Their journey to the Ghost Mountain had two goals.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, they intended to fuse with the Treacherous Beings as Treacherous Beings could greatly increase their strength. On the other hand, they planned to search for the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other human beings.</p>

  <p>Time was pressing in on them now that the Eye Spirit was hot on their heels. Merging with the Treacherous Beings might have to be postponed.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you there!"</p>

  <p>Bacchus said, turned around, and walked to the front, leading the way for the Glede Demons, Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>The area before them began to close up after they had passed through this open space.</p>

  <p>The surroundings were pitch black but everyone could still clearly see that there were many Treacherous Beings floating on both sides of the road.</p>

  <p>These Treacherous Beings varied in shapes, but were very small.</p>

  <p>The biggest Treacherous Being was only half as tall as a person, and the smallest was the size of a palm.</p>

  <p>The aura they emitted was neither strong nor aggressive. All of them were of the friendly type.</p>

  <p>As Zheng and the others passed by, they sensed the existence of the Arcana and surrounded them.</p>
