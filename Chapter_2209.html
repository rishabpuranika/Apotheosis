<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It's that pair of eyes again!" Malloy exclaimed, raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The main reason Luo Luo Zheng was easily and quickly recognized by the Divine Dao Tablets in the Consulting God Hall was due to his eyes!</p>

  <p>So much so in fact that some people even believed that Luo Luo Zheng had Fire God Eyes.</p>

  <p>Although Bentley hadn't personally appeared at the scene, he had certainly heard of Luo Zheng's eyes with the golden rings. Upon looking at them now, he was truly impressed.</p>

  <p>Yazid's expression was also full of surprise. He had no idea how Luo Luo Zheng could have struggled in his Five Elements Destructing with such golden eyes.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler's scale of the Five Elements Divine Dao was flashing with a blazing golden light!</p>

  <p>At the same time, the internal momentum that rushed into Luo Zheng's mind gathered on the ruler's scale!</p>

  <p>The internal momentum absorbed by the Infinity Ruler wasn't the original Five Elements Divine Dao, but the internal momentum of the Five Elements Destructing, which was actually understood by Yazid himself. And as the Infinity Ruler absorbed the internal momentum, Luo Luo Zheng felt as though a stream of clear water was being injected into his mind.</p>

  <p>"According to the nature of the heaven and earth, water can quench fire...</p>

  <p>Fire can melt metal... And metal can chop wood..."</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Luo Luo Zheng unexpectedly understood Yazid's token, the Five Elements Destructing, through the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>"According to the Five Elements Destructing, one element would be destroyed by another as the five elements restrict each other. In such a case, the five elements could also generate each other in order to become consummate. At that point, it becomes easy to break the Five Elements Destructing."</p>

  <p>It was obviously unrealistic for Luo Luo Zheng to break through a top-rank True God's token.</p>

  <p>Although Yazid had used his unique skill, one thing was certain: he hadn't used all his strength. Thus, Luo Luo Zheng actually had a chance of winning!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure suddenly began to shake as the chaotic energy quickly circulated in his inner world. It immediately turned into the power of the five elements, which gushed out from his body like five distinct rivers.</p>

  <p>"Five Elements Divine Dao?" one of the leaders of the Han Clan sub-branches asked, as he frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, you're correct. He is activating the Five Elements Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The question is, what is he trying to do?" another leader replied, his eyes still fixed on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Divine Dao was one of the most common Divine Dao in the divine land and countless people cultivated it. Yazid was capable of having his own insights when it came to the Five Elements Divine Dao, which undoubtedly made him a top leader. If Luo Luo Zheng used the Five Elements Divine Dao now, it would be equivalent to displaying his measly skill before an expert.</p>

  <p>"Does Luo Luo Zheng plan to use the Five Elements Divine Dao to break through..."</p>

  <p>Malloy hesitated for a second before continuing. "The Five Elements Destructing? Is he making a huge mistake?" Malloy felt rather confused, now. If Luo Luo Zheng couldn't see through the foundation of the Five Elements Destructing, there was no way he'd successfully break through the Five Elements Destructing even after he employed the Five Elements Divine Dao. Besides, he would be taken advantage of by Yazid. After all, according to Luo Zheng's Five Elements Divine Dao, the five elements would restrict one another. It was very easy for Yazid to disturb Luo Zheng's Five Elements Divine Dao and transform the latter into the Five Elements Destructing power.</p>

  <p>"That's not necessarily the case." Bentley shook his head in reply.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's strength might not be even very powerful in his eyes, he was definitely not stupid. He believed that there had been a reason for him to display the Five Elements Divine Dao. He just didn't know whether or not his situation could be changed in this case.</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Yazid felt a little shocked. Then, he sneered and said, "Huh! Does he want to die?"</p>

  <p>Under everyone's watchful eyes, Luo Luo Zheng gently waved his hands, and the power of the five elements began to erupt. In terms of his control of the Five Elements Divine Dao, Luo Luo Zheng had already far surpassed a proving godly warrior whose main practice was exactly that.</p>

  <p>After all, the five elements power was formed through chaotic energy, so it wasn't weaker than the momentum that a True God could gather through the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>'The Five Elements Destructing makes the five elements restrict each other and can generate the formidable power of destruction. However, if I let the five elements generate each other through five elements' power before the elements restrict one another, it's impossible for the destruction power to be generated.'</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>From behind Luo Luo Zheng, a water dragon spiraled over and rushed toward a golden fire bird. Generally speaking, in such a situation, water would quench fire and the destruction power would be produced!</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>With a flick of both Luo Zheng's hands, a myriad of golden radiance appeared on the left one, and a faint shadow of huge wood appeared in the right!</p>

  <p>Before the water dragon had the chance to restrict the fire bird, Luo Luo Zheng released metal and wood power in advance, in order to let metal produce water and the wood feed the fire.</p>

  <p>With the combined forces, the power of the five elements' foundation gradually began to transform itself. Furthermore, the power of the five elements became consummate, offsetting the power of destruction.</p>

  <p>"It's complete!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled, and without a single moment's pause, he fell into a state of absolute concentration.</p>

  <p>As long as there were two of five elements in this area to restrict each other, Luo Luo Zheng would use the corresponding power of the five elements in order to allow the elements to generate one another.</p>

  <p>Of course, at the time, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea that it was currently completely silent inside the main hall of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True Gods and the top-rank True Gods all stared at the scene before them in disbelief!</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng hadn't counteracted all of the destruction power, he had counteracted at least more than ninety percent. The rest of the destruction power was no longer a threat to him. In other words, this meant that Luo Luo Zheng had been capable of breaking through the Five Elements Destructing that Yazid had understood in a very short period of time!</p>

  <p>Yazid's true strength was much weaker than that of Bentley, but Yazid was a top-rank True God after all, and the Five Elements Destructing that he had realized was quite famous across the divine land. Many True Gods, who cultivated the Five Elements Divine Dao, wanted to practice this token, but Yazid had never taught anyone else to practice the Five Elements Destructing. In fact, even his descendants didn't have a chance to learn such a token from him!</p>

  <p>Now though, Luo Luo Zheng had actually seen through the Five Elements Destructing, and simultaneously, he destroyed it using extremely simple and even crude methods.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>A silly smile finally spread across Bentley's originally gloomy face.</p>

  <p>Malloy and the others fixed their eyes on Luo Luo Zheng, with mixed emotions.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had succeeded, the only explanation was that he had understood the Five Elements Destructing.</p>

  <p>However, the Five Elements Destructing simply was nothing like the Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>Because everyone was allowed to observe and comprehend the internal momentum of the Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>On the other hand though, the Five Elements Destructing's internal momentum was isolated. Only Yazid himself was capable of seeing through it, and the others couldn't even figure out its mechanism.</p>

  <p>Not to mention the proving godly warriors, even Malloy and Bentley couldn't succeed such a feat. Malloy equally believed that it was impossible for a Holy Being to comprehend the complete internal momentum of the Five Elements Destructing in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Despite all that though, things like this did happen, even if they were rare.</p>

  <p>What Malloy didn't know was that the Infinity Ruler was an unreasonable treasure for breaking through the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum, which was absorbed into the Infinity Ruler, was actually constantly recorded by it. At the same time, the internal momentum would be turned into a small scale on the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>There was no secret from any internal momentum before the Infinity Ruler and all internal momentum could easily be broken by the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Yazid was stunned and could do nothing but stand still, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>He had created the Five Elements Destructing, and was clear on the complexity of the latter. The Five Elements Destructing was his unique method. In fact, he was the only person in the divine land to master such a token.</p>

  <p>Because he had stayed on the Floating Island all year round and had seldom fought with other people, no one had been capable of breaking through the Five Elements Destructing over the years. This didn't mean that the Five Elements Destructing was invincible, though. Not at all. To the contrary, there were still numerous other theurgies that were much more powerful than the Five Elements Destructing, and there were many top-rank True Gods that could defeat Yazid. The only thing was that no one could break Yazid's token.</p>

  <p>'This brat has even understood the Five Elements Destructing's internal momentum! How is that possible? I have to kill him because he has broken my internal momentum!'</p>

  <p>Among the top-rank True Gods, Yazid wasn't considered to be very powerful. He couldn't be ranked among the top True Gods in the Han Clan, not to mention in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Those who weren't very remarkable would cherish their token very much. The Five Elements Destructing was Yazid's masterpiece. No matter how Luo Luo Zheng broke his internal momentum, Yazid simply couldn't bear watching him do it.</p>

  <p>Right then, it was extremely difficult for Yazid to suppress his evil thoughts.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the creatures in Yazid's inner world all began quietly offering their Faith Energy. The Faith Energy intertwined into thin threads and gathered in his Godly Tile. The momentum that Yazid had used before was very insignificant, but now that he had the killing intent, it was different and much more meaningful.</p>

  <p>For the top-rank True God, killing Luo Luo Zheng was going to be a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>The moment the power began gushing out, Luo Luo Zheng had sensed something strange.</p>

  <p>In this illusory space, the five elements' power that surrounded him had quickly undergone a fundamental change.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had fought with little snakes before, then now he was facing a gigantic dragon. The top-rank True God would easily suppress and even kill Luo Luo Zheng only by means of the five elements' power, without ever even using the Five Elements Destructing. This, now this was the power of a top-rank True God!</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Zheng's eyes froze. He had never expected Yazid to take serious action!</p>

  <p>"Watch out! That old man is going to kill you, Luo Luo Zheng!" Even Master Evil had realized that Luo Zheng's actions had provoked Yazid.</p>
