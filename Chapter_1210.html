  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although every single person from the Celestial Position had his or her attention focused on the Evil Dragon, Luo Zheng's sudden disappearance attracted their gaze. They noticed the sudden movement despite their lack of attention.</p>

  <p>"A little mouse has run away! Hey Dorothea. Isn't she the one you have a crush on?" The black clothed young man taunted with a smile.</p>

  <p>However, the person wearing the silver mask said, "Don't let her run around. Chase after her. There's gonna be so much trouble if she breaks the Ancestral Dragon Egg's hatch."</p>

  <p>The flower in Dorothea's eye spun slightly as a look of astonishment came to her face. "Delroy has put up an enchanted barrier around it. It's not gonna be destroyed, right? But I guess it's best if I capture her and bring her back." After she finished speaking, she chuckled and chased after Luo Luo Zheng with a bell-like laughter tolling behind her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was crazily circulating the life vitality within Brianna's body and continuously stimulating the Wind Law. His figure was moving like a shuttle and rapidly traveling through the air.</p>

  <p>"This fellow..."</p>

  <p>Brianna was completely shocked now and didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>To be able to grasp even thirty percent of the Cloud-chasing Skill in such a short period of time was a remarkable feat in itself. That was what she had told Luo Luo Zheng but she didn't have too much hope with him.</p>

  <p>In any case, she had taught the Cloud-chasing Skill to Luo Luo Zheng as a frantic last-minute effort when she was left with no options. However, she had never thought that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to grasp almost all of it in such a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Just how strong was this fellow's innate talent?</p>

  <p>If she were to count the capabilities this young man possessed, she would be at a loss. She already knew that the nine dragons had been residing inside his mind for a long time. And since he was chosen by her grandfather, it was clear that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't a common warrior. It was still shocking to see just how powerful he was, though.</p>

  <p>Even in the Genuine Dragon World, which was filled with hundreds of talented warriors, she had never seen someone with these many capabilities.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had actually grasped seventy percent of the Cloud-chasing Skill within a span of five minutes. In fact, judging by his speed, he might even have grasped more than eighty percent. The black lines Brianna could see behind her were something that only appeared when the Cloud-chasing Lion was running at its top most speed, which compressed the wind around its body to the maximum.</p>

  <p>Brianna herself could unleash the full effects of the Cloud-chasing Skill, but this cultivation technique was created from imitating the innate talent of a legendary beast, which was known as the Cloud-chasing Lion.</p>

  <p>When the Cloud-chasing Lion ran at full pelt, it would create black lines behind it, like a brush doing its work.</p>

  <p>This was something that even Brianna couldn't do. However, Luo Luo Zheng had completely mastered it within five minutes, and had even achieved a higher level of cultivation than herself.</p>

  <p>Now things were getting a bit too hot to handle!</p>

  <p>Outside, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea Brianna was in great shock. In complement to Brianna's amazement, he was sighing at the strength of this Spirit Supreme Realm body he was using and the unparalleled purity of the life vitality inside it. Normally, the life vitality could last for an okay amount of time, but he could feel that the explosive power of the life vitality within Brianna's body was comparable to his own forceful energy.</p>

  <p>Whir!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flew past the exit of the sacred place very soon and directly flew through the arch where they had first appeared.</p>

  <p>He was moving so fast that he didn't even have the time to assess the situation and directly charged towards the arch. In fact, not until he had passed through the arch did he realize that something was wrong! He didn't enter the transmission channel. How was he supposed to get back?</p>

  <p>"What? The transmission channel has been closed!" Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback.</p>

  <p>When they had entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, they had used the two dragon-shaped keys to open the arch and then activated a transmission channel. Now, the channel had disappeared and the arch was just a stone structure.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's case, it was nothing more than a decoration.</p>

  <p>Immediately after he stopped, he heard a bell-like laughter behind him.</p>

  <p>"Bet you're surprised about that, huh? Come back with me without making a fuss and I won't kill you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned and asked, "I'm not your enemy. Why did you pursue me so relentlessly?"</p>

  <p>"Eh? Who said that we were enemies? I like you, so you have to come with me. Got it?" Dorothea laughed and continued, "Once we have taken care of this place, I will take you somewhere else. The flying passage in the great world has already been destroyed. You don't want to be trapped here for your entire life, do you?"</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face. So that was the secret.</p>

  <p>Dorothea was an open minded person. She liked women.</p>

  <p>"It seems like this woman has taken a fancy to you," Luo Luo Zheng teased Brianna with a smile.</p>

  <p>Brianna screamed from within her body with a red face, "Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Don't move. Follow me obediently." Dorothea's voice suddenly became gentle, and the flower in her right eye slowly started to rotate as she gradually moved closer to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's gaze turned soft. He actually forgot to flee, and stood still there. In Luo Zheng's eyes, Dorothea had transformed into a unique beauty of the human world. Her entire body was exuding an unfathomable color, and somehow, looked like Luo Zheng's greatest desire for a woman.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was standing there in a daze, he suddenly felt a sharp, stabbing pain inside him and instantly regained his consciousness.</p>

  <p>"You were being hypnotized by her! Hurry up and run!" Brianna screamed.</p>

  <p>Dorothea had already gotten extremely close to Luo Luo Zheng by now. Her eyes looked gentle and soft as she reached out her hand to caress Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The instant he woke up, Luo Luo Zheng punched out. At the same time, he triggered the life vitality within the body. His entire body turned into a violent gust of wind and suddenly evaporated right where he stood.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had already travelled thousands of feet away from Dorothea.</p>

  <p>Dorothea didn't seem to be in a hurry as she followed behind Luo Luo Zheng at a leisurely pace. The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was only about the size of her palm as far as she was concerned. No matter how fast Luo Luo Zheng was, and how many laws he used, it was impossible for him to escape.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng changed his direction and continued to speed along. He was thinking about how he was going to leave the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Although they had originally entered through a transmission array, the place was still a physical construct and was built inside the Feather Holy Sea, which existed in the same dimension as his own.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was able to find a space crack, he would be able to leave without the need of a transmission channel. However, as he traveled, disappointment appeared on his face. He could not discover a single crack in the fabric of space around him.</p>

  <p>"Aooo?" Another wave of earth-shaking voice came.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, the six Celestial Position warriors and the Evil Dragon were still engaged in a fierce battle. Even from such a long distance, Luo Luo Zheng could still see that a thick pillar of fire was shooting towards the sky. From the looks of it, the battle had already reached its climax.</p>

  <p>However, he chose to ignore the battle. But the slight moment of losing attention did cost him. While he was running, a white flower strangely appeared not far in front of him. That flower was blooming at an unbelievable speed, and Dorothea walked out from within the flower.</p>

  <p>She had a smile on her face as she told Luo Luo Zheng, "Little thing, you won't be able to escape!"</p>

  <p>When he saw this scene, Luo Luo Zheng didn't pause and swept past her again.</p>

  <p>Dorothea kept pursuing Luo Luo Zheng in the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, still travelling at her leisurely pace. After a while, Luo Luo Zheng noticed a transparent enchanted barrier covering a spire not too far away.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed faintly when he saw the transparent barrier.</p>

  <p>It seemed that dramatic changes were taking place inside the barrier, whatever that place was. The bottom of the spire seethed and teemed with life, with all sorts of strange flowers and herbs covering the area.</p>

  <p>Vines were coiled around the exterior walls of the spire, and the strangest thing was that these plants were growing at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye. In fact, not only growth, Luo Luo Zheng could even see death as the vines seethed, grew, twisted, withered and died.</p>

  <p>"Time! The speed at which time is passing within that barrier is remarkably fast!" "What exactly is inside that spire?" Luo Luo Zheng enquired.</p>

  <p>Brianna shook her head. "I'm not sure. The barrier has almost completely isolated all of the auras from within and I can't feel a thing."</p>

  <p>"Let's go in." Regardless of what was inside, Luo Luo Zheng didn't think too much and charged towards the barrier. He didn't have much of a choice anyway. The moment he approached the barrier, his life vitality gushed out and he punched the barrier with all of his strength.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even though he was controlling a Spirit Supreme Realm body, his punch did not even crack the barrier.</p>
