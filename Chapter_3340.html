<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to Mike and the others that such a vicious thing was hiding in the cracks of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>They turned pale with fright and stepped back.</p>

  <p>"The Holy Being of the Fang Clan has been sucked into the crack!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he's been killed!"</p>

  <p>"Don't get too close to the tombstone, everyone!" the Holy Beings reminded one another.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings took solace in the thought that death was not the end for them. They could be resurrected.</p>

  <p>Just then, a rune emerged beside Ramzi. He gently pressed it with his finger. Timotheus' voice rang out. "The universe of the Holy Being of the Fang Clan has collapsed."</p>

  <p>The group's noise died down immediately as they registered the news in shock.</p>

  <p>"How come his universe collapsed?"</p>

  <p>"Then is he dead for good?"</p>

  <p>"How could that be?!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings could not believe what had happened. Their universes were their talismans. How could a talisman just be obliterated like that?</p>

  <p>"The Ruin Graveyard has its own rules. And it's not so difficult to cut off the connection to the Rebirth Land. Be careful, everyone," Ramzi reminded.</p>

  <p>Most of the true masters in the Source World would not rely on their Rebirth Lands. On the one hand, the Rebirth Land was a place of restraint.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it was not so safe.</p>

  <p>As the Holy Beings fretted, a head appeared from a dark crack.</p>

  <p>It was a black toad over 200 feet long. A ghastly face was embedded on its back.</p>

  <p>"What kind of monster is this?"</p>

  <p>"What a disgusting face!"</p>

  <p>"So the Holy Being of the Fang Clan was swallowed by this monster?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had seen many abominable creatures in the divine land.</p>

  <p>When the toad showed itself, everyone was somehow relieved because it didn't seem as bad.</p>

  <p>The strength of so many Holy Beings couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Ramzi was a powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm. They were confident they could deal with the toad.</p>

  <p>But after the first toad appeared, many other toads appeared from the cracks.</p>

  <p>The tombstone was as large as the divine land. The cracks seemed negligible on the tombstone, but in fact, each of them was several thousand feet wide. The space inside was unimaginably large.</p>

  <p>The toads that had come out from these cracks stood densely in a row, sending out a cold aura.</p>

  <p>Their cheeks were bulging in unison.</p>

  <p>"The Ruin Graveyard is the toads' nest?"</p>

  <p>"The toads aren't alone here, are they?"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Any of the toads could swallow the Holy Beings effortlessly. And there were over a thousand toads in front of them. If the creatures pounced on them, how would they be able to fend them all off?</p>

  <p>"We need to get out of here," Mike hissed urgently.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings had long wanted to leave. They were only too happy to comply with Mike's orders.</p>

  <p>But just as they were set to retreat, they heard a strange flute-like sound.</p>

  <p>The ghastly faces on all the toads' backs opened their mouths and emitted shrill cries at the same time.</p>

  <p>As one, the toads jumped up and rushed toward the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>At this sight, the Holy Beings' blood ran cold.</p>

  <p>"Use the Grand Teleportation!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Every time the space waves formed, they disappeared instantly.</p>

  <p>"Master, we can't use the Grand Teleportation in this place!" said Sword Chen, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>He had a strong will since he had stayed in the Abyss Demon Region for so long, but even he was unnerved to see the toads charging at them.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings tried again but failed, just like Sword Chen. The space channel could not be opened.</p>

  <p>In panic, they could only rapidly fall back.</p>

  <p>However, the black toads moved faster than them. They moved in the empty space without making a sound. In the blink of an eye, many toads had circled the Holy Beings, surrounding them completely.</p>

  <p>Compared to the panic-stricken Holy Beings, Ramzi was much calmer.</p>

  <p>His fingers flipped in the air, and pale yellow runes surfaced in front of him.</p>

  <p>The runes formed circles of light and spread out, turning into a large array.</p>

  <p>The array was surging and sparking with extremely terrifying power. He directed the Holy Beings, "Everyone, come over here."</p>

  <p>In this group, no one was more powerful than Ramzi. The Holy Beings were confident in his strength. They scrambled into the array formed by the runes, grasping eagerly at what they knew was a last life-saving straw.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic. These toads must be under the control of some other mastermind," Ramzi deduced.</p>

  <p>After all, he was much more knowledgeable than the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The toads obviously weren't sentient. They only attacked, by instinct, the creatures that dared to approach the cracks.</p>

  <p>However, when the strange flute sounded, all the toads moved in an organized manner. Obviously, they were being manipulated by someone.</p>

  <p>The most important thing now was that these toads appeared to be obeying some silent order and weren't attacking.</p>

  <p>The flute sound was getting louder and louder.</p>

  <p>The screams of the faces on the toads were likewise growing more intense.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Holy Beings saw a dozen black dots flying out from behind the tombstone.</p>

  <p>As the dots approached, the group mistook them for insects.</p>

  <p>Only when they came nearer did the Holy Beings see clearly what they were.</p>

  <p>They were not bugs, but human beings!</p>

  <p>They were all wearing masks made of insect heads and shell armor on their bodies, making them look like actual bugs from a distance.</p>

  <p>"There are actually human beings in the Ruin Graveyard!" Even Ramzi, who was usually composed, was surprised.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard was famous for its dangers, and various vicious races were lurking within it. Who would have thought that humans would be among them?</p>

  <p>The men in carapace armor approached, crossed the toads' encirclement, and put the flutes down. "You, follow us!" their leader barked out.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"You don't have the right to ask questions," the leader replied stiffly. He put his flute to his mouth and started playing a gentle tune.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>The toads started to stir. It was clear if the armored men kept playing their flutes, the toads would pounce on the group without hesitation.</p>

  <p>These men disregarded Ramzi's array completely. The Holy Beings knew then it wouldn't protect them.</p>

  <p>"Do as they say and don't resist," Mike said to the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Any wrong move and they would get killed.</p>

  <p>Now that Mike had given the order, the other Holy Beings decided to cooperate.</p>

  <p>The armored men led the way, while the toads surrounded the Holy Beings layer by layer. Together, they flew toward the cracks in the upper right corner of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, Timotheus returned to the internal region of the sun and tied the four rings to his body.</p>

  <p>He had the sharpest and broadest vision in the entire divine land. He had thus witnessed the events at the tombstone.</p>
