<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3633 General Offensive </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Negative thoughts began to flood Elizabeth's mind. After all, she couldn't help but feel doubtful when she heard the plan from Emperor Charm for the first time.</p>

  <p>If the Purge Way was carried out according to the way Emperor Charm had said, then less than ten thousand people were qualified to live. She couldn't imagine the consequences of such a thing.</p>

  <p>Although she was highly uncertain, she did not show it.</p>

  <p>Since Emperor Charm was the king of the whole Sun Crow race, Elizabeth still believed his decisions unconditionally, even if she herself was the commander in chief of the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>After the great change in the Source World, however, no one knew how many people could survive safely. Furthermore, it was rather dull to live in a world with less than ten thousand creatures.</p>

  <p>In the end, Elizabeth only sighed and gently waved her hand forward. All the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows flapped their wings, and many demon women from the Divine Lair stood behind the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Numerous Sun Crows turned into dark clouds once again and enveloped the whole atmosphere. After that, it became impossible to see everything inside the dark cloud enclosure from the outside.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sinclair did not look pleased in the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Many people had died from the moment he had guarded the Mountain Sea Pass, but all of them were insignificant Other Shore Realm warriors. Only a few Oneness Guards were killed.</p>

  <p>Besides, the twelve Oneness Generals who had fought against the Sun Crows in the positions of the array were completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>This time, it wasn't easy for Sinclair to invite five disciples from the Land of Sword Grief to offer help. It was like adding five Oneness Generals to the array, but in the blink of an eye, they lost two Oneness Generals already! More importantly, those two who died were Kemp and Hargrove, his right-hand men!</p>

  <p>"It's indeed a pity that Kemp and Hargrove died, but the Mountain Sea Pass is still fine. If it weren't for Zheng, the Mountain Sea Pass would have been captured," Basil, who was beside him, comforted.</p>

  <p>A few seconds had passed, and Sinclair finally calmed down a bit and nodded. "It was really close. I went to check the main array, and they don't have many divine crystals left.</p>

  <p>The array of the Mountain Sea Pass withstood this round of attack, but at the price of a hundred million divine crystals..." he said.</p>

  <p>If Zheng hadn't killed a large number of Self-exploding Sun Crows, the Mountain Sea Pass would have been besieged. "Since there are not many divine crystals left, won't the array of the Mountain Sea Pass be unable to work?" Guzman asked.</p>

  <p>"The Vastness Mountain is sending two hundred million divine crystals here. There shouldn't be any problem," Sinclair answered.</p>

  <p>Such a war would definitely consume a great deal of divine crystals. A single battle could possibly cost about ten billion divine crystals, and sometimes it could go up to hundreds of billions of divine crystals. It was so disastrous that the weak forces often ran out of divine crystals before the war ended.</p>

  <p>"But I'm afraid it's still difficult to deal with them if the demon woman of the Divine Lair continues to lead the team to attack," Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Right now, it was totally lucky for Zheng to have found out the location of the demon woman from the Divine Lair. It was thanks to his discovery that he was able to stab her a few times.</p>

  <p>However, if she continued to bring the Sun Crows to attack again, he would probably have a hard time finding her if he relied solely on luck.</p>

  <p>"If only the Sun Crows didn't attack frequently." Basil sighed.</p>

  <p>Overall, the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and the Other Shore Realm warriors who were stationed at the Mountain Sea Pass never had a good sleep ever since the crisis began.</p>

  <p>"It seems that they won't take action frequently in the future," Zheng said with a smile. "What do you mean?" Basil asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's lips curved into a pout, while the others looked into the distance. Basil also turned to look, and then his gaze froze in shock.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crows had formed dark clouds in their previous attack, and now they had gathered together and took up half of the sky!</p>

  <p>The entire sky was divided into black and white. The white part of the sky was an area that the Sun Crows did not cover, and the black part was filled with countless Sun Crows. Then, the black skyline slowly moved towards the Sky Net and devoured it little by little.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the length of the entire skyline was almost impossible to measure! "It's a general offensive!" Sinclair exclaimed with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Give the order to the Vastness Mountain!" an Oneness General roared.</p>

  <p>"Give the order to the Azure Array!</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race is launching a general offensive!" a silver armored Oneness General shouted from the top of the Heavenly Wind Pass.</p>

  <p>According to the Oneness Sky Palace's orders, the seven arrays and twelve passes in front of the North Mysterious City were the last defense line.</p>

  <p>Once this defense line was broken, the entire Bloom Divine Province would fall.</p>

  <p>If that really happened, then the Oneness Sky Palace would have no place to hide except for the seven mountains!</p>

  <p>Now that they were under the Sun Crow race's general offensive, they had no choice but to guard their territory with all their might.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Evil God sat nonchalantly on the roof of the house at one side of the Heavenly Wind Pass. He appeared to be quite unconcerned as he looked at the dense mass of Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>The Inner-world Generating Avatar was a little different from the Rebirth Land. With the Rebirth Land, Zheng could only sense where he was, but not what he was doing or thinking. Zheng wouldn't even be able to tell his location from a distance.</p>

  <p>However, the Inner-world Generating Avatar was more closely linked to him. Even if they were more than one hundred miles away from each other, Zheng could still discern the thoughts in the Evil God's mind.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had a strong feeling that he had lied to Zheng and planned to escape, but the memories in his mind were not right. The feeling made him uneasy.</p>

  <p>He hoped that more black Sun Crows would come over, and that the world would be more chaotic...</p>

  <p>At that moment, the runes were connected from end to end and converged towards the center of the Azure Array.</p>

  <p>In the center of the Azure Array, countless layers of runes wrapped around a particular item. At a glance, it looked like a sword, but it was difficult to see what it was because so many runes were wrapped around it.</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man with long hair stood in the center of the array with his hands behind his back. Then, he gently placed his hand on the item wrapped in the runes.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>Just then, all the runes became weightless and floated upwards. They looked like thousands of yellow birds that had taken flight. However, it turned out that there was nothing wrapped in the runes right now!</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Then, the runes condensed together and formed a huge sword. This sword contained a strange but powerful aura.</p>

  <p>"I haven't used the Heavenly Rune Sword for a long time. It's a pity that Fuxi is not here," said the middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man with long hair was the leader of the Azure Mountain, Jonathan Su.</p>

  <p>Numerous Oneness Generals guarded the twelve passes, while the leaders of the seven mountains watched over the seven arrays. However, not all of the leaders came.</p>

  <p>In the Origin Array</p>

  <p>Countless rays of sword light twisted, rotated, and surged in the array like water ripples.</p>

  <p>Beside the Origin Array stood Winchell and the other masters of the Origin Mountain. All of them looked serious and solemn.</p>

  <p>If it was a battle of life and death, the Oneness Sky Palace might not be afraid of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>However, the seven arrays were currently in their greatest crisis, and that was the absence of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.</p>

  <p>Without those two, the strength of the Oneness Sky Palace had decreased by more than fifty percent!</p>

  <p>Moreover, the outsiders still did not know the news. Then again, if all the soldiers knew it, they would probably suffer from low morale before the battle began.</p>

  <p>As the beautiful woman who sat in the center of the Origin Array looked at the sullen faces of Winchell and the others, she suddenly said, "Don't worry, everyone. Madam Yasamin has already nurtured six million Deity Sword Souls. Although my cultivation base is far inferior to that of Madam Yasamin and I can only use one move of the Origin Deity Attack, we are not that far from each other when it comes to our strength."</p>

  <p>The beautiful woman was called Felicity, and she had a close relationship with Dorothy. She was also Winchell's sister-in-law.</p>

  <p>Although Yasamin had always regarded Dorothy as her successor, the war was about to begin and Dorothy's cultivation base was still low even though she had mastered the Origin Swordsmanship. Therefore, it was Felicity who had to go into battle.</p>
