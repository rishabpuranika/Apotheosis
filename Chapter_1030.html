<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1030 Contempt </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everything in the world had a cause and an effect.</p>

  <p>This was because those who lived in this world were destined to lead a difficult life.</p>

  <p>With hard work in cultivation, warriors succeeded in making great achievements in the name of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Why was that?</p>

  <p>Compared to other kinds of Law Powers, the Law of Causality was the purest and most direct.</p>

  <p>But the cause and effect of all things were built upon the foundation of Nature Law— when one Nature Law was created, all causalities were decided. Therefore, the power of the Law of Causality was the top authority of the Nature Law.</p>

  <p>No one in this world could completely comprehend the Law of Causality unless they were transformed into the Nature Law.</p>

  <p>Xun looked at Luo Zheng nervously— although there were several causes and effects within the Heavenly Fragment, it was still only a fragment. Neither she nor the cyan dragon knew much about the Law of Causality and the effect of the Heavenly Fragment.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng died, his sword spirit would gradually dissipate, leaving Xun's last strand of soul alone without support until it dissipated into the air as well.</p>

  <p>As for the cyan dragon, it would once again be sealed within the mysterious smelting furnace.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, everyone's attention wasn't focused on Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie, but on Eddie.</p>

  <p>The power of Zheng's first round of attack had already gone beyond what anyone imagined.</p>

  <p>The power of a middle-stage Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior was even much stronger than that of a Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Under such an attack, how could Eddie still be alive?</p>

  <p>As long as Eddie died, Simon would become the sole powerful master in the Heavenly Evil Sect. Because he was a Life and Death Realm warrior, he was a difficult one to deal with. But as the other warriors of the Heavenly Evil sect were not as powerful, Simon alone wouldn't be able to defeat all his opponents at once. Perhaps the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall could take an advantageous position during the war when the time came.</p>

  <p>Eddie's importance was clear to both sides, because only his life and death had a real impact on the situation, and their fights weren't truly meaningful.</p>

  <p>The two rays of intertwining starlight gradually dissipated in the wind, along with the rocks, dirt, trees, and rubble from the city walls.</p>

  <p>As the dust thinned in the air, the person lying at the bottom of the huge pit came into view.</p>

  <p>The body was pitch black, like a completely burnt sweet potato, with charred skin on a motionless body.</p>

  <p>"It's Eddie!"</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>"He's not moving… He must be dead. It would be impossible for him to survive that attack."</p>

  <p>The warriors standing by started murmuring among themselves.</p>

  <p>Many of them on the city wall hoped that he was done for— Eddie's death meant a victory on their part.</p>

  <p>However, as they stared at the body, Eddie suddenly began moving.</p>

  <p>The motion shocked all the members of the World Commercial Alliance and Cloud Hall. Their hearts sank as they watched the scene before them.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Eddie stretched out his limbs and stood from the ground.</p>

  <p>Even in such a sorry state, Eddie was clearly alive.</p>

  <p>"This, this…</p>

  <p>Just now, Zheng's attack was unimaginable. But Eddie was even more astounding… He survived that hit!"</p>

  <p>"It's too incredible to be real. Eddie must be unbeatable. How tough can that body be?"</p>

  <p>While the warriors in Oracle City were left upset and dejected, the warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect were high in spirits— they had concrete proof that Eddie was indeed a powerful warrior they could trust.</p>

  <p>"Lord, you're the best! You are the most mighty king! You are our hero!"</p>

  <p>Once again, the independent warriors roared, with the loud and earthshaking voice.</p>

  <p>"He might be very weak now…</p>

  <p>I should take this chance…</p>

  <p>If I strike now, I can kill him!" Staring at Eddie who was in the hole, Morphens suddenly rushed toward Eddie.</p>

  <p>He understood that killing Eddie was the only real way to end this war.</p>

  <p>Even after surviving such a heavy blow, Eddie was still left weak and injured, and Morphens was certain that Eddie wouldn't be able to fight back any longer.</p>

  <p>But just as Morphens charged at him, Eddie's sluggish body suddenly turned nimble— his charred arm threw a punch.</p>

  <p>It took Morphens aback— he couldn't dodge Eddie's attack this time.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The punch knocked Morphens out of the hole, but no one could tell if he was dead or alive.</p>

  <p>The crowd watched as Eddie's burnt face wore a sinister smile, his mouth wide open. Two rows of white teeth were visible in his mouth, looking extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>"We're doomed..."</p>

  <p>Everyone understood that the war between the two forces could end soon.</p>

  <p>Although Eddie was still standing, suffering from serious injuries, his fighting strength didn't seem to be depleted.</p>

  <p>What about Luo Zheng… and what about Ning Yudie?</p>

  <p>It was only at this moment that the crowd finally remembered the two.</p>

  <p>The two of them lay on the ground, sharing an embrace.</p>

  <p>During Luo Zheng and Eddie's battle, the two bright yellow winds were still fresh in everyone's mind. The two winds weren't destroyed by Zheng's attack— they might have already blown over Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>No one knew what the wind actually was, but since it blew that Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance to death, how could Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie manage to resist it?</p>

  <p>The edge of the hole was covered in fine powder. With every step Eddie took heading outside the hole, a cloud of dust blew into the air.</p>

  <p>The moment he left, he immediately made his way toward Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Xun had already activated the Heavenly Fragment and positioned it beside Luo Zheng. Seeing Eddie walk over, she pulled out a long spear out of Zheng's space ring and pointed it at the man.</p>

  <p>Wearing a deadly serious expression, she coldly shouted, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>With a laugh, Eddie continued, "I don't know what you are. Maybe you're Zheng's greatest secret. He's dead now. Would you like to come and stay with me?"</p>

  <p>"Haha…" A contemptuous smile surfaced on Xun's face.</p>

  <p>"What is that laugh for? Am I not qualified? Soon enough, I'll be the strongest master in the Central Region. The entire Central Region will be under my control! I am the ruler and king here!"</p>

  <p>Eddie's voice thundered as he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He spoke not only to Xun but also to all the warriors present around him.</p>

  <p>"What a joke. How ridiculous… You're just a nobody— an ant in a small Central Region of the Lower World. How dare you be so arrogant?"</p>

  <p>Xun stared him down with contempt. "Even a Life and Death Realm warrior is nothing in my eyes. Back then, with just a millionth of my strength, I could kill you in a single glance. And you want me to stay with you? Do you really think you're qualified for that?"</p>

  <p>Xun's words stunned the whole crowd.</p>

  <p>What on earth was the true identity of Zheng's sword spirit? She could kill Eddie with just a millionth of her strength?</p>

  <p>The warriors couldn't tell whether or not Xun was merely bragging about her strength. Neither did they know of her actual identity.</p>

  <p>Even Eddie was left stunned by her words. Although he knew the foreign woman had an extraordinary background, he never thought he would hear such words come out of her mouth. Just what level of strength did this woman once have? What kind of force did she come from?</p>

  <p>Turning to Luo Zheng, Eddie muttered, "It's strange. Zheng's life vitality is supposed to be completely gone, but he's still alive."</p>

  <p>With that, he ignored Xun's spear and made his way to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing Eddie make another move, Xun didn't hesitate at all. As she shook her long spear, an invisible wave shot right toward Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>Although the power of the spear's strike was just as powerful as Zheng's attack, when it stabbed through Eddie's body, it seemed to pierce through the cotton fiber, distorted by some strange power of Eddie.</p>

  <p>Immediately taking hold of Xun's long spear, Eddie moved his hand, hitting and breaking Xun into countless sword spirits which then began gathering within Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>After looking at the scene for a while, Eddie put the spear into his own space ring and continued making his way toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Fifty feet...</p>

  <p>Thirty feet...</p>

  <p>Eddie's gaze fell on a piece of debris on Zheng's chest. His eyes lit up, revealing a peculiar luster.</p>

  <p>"This fragment…"</p>

  <p>While he didn't know the background of the fragment nor how powerful it was, he discovered that Zheng's life vitality was sustained by that very fragment. It led him to believe that it wasn't any ordinary thing.</p>

  <p>Although Eddie could make use of the Life and Death Wind, it didn't mean that he had control over it. In reality, Eddie hadn't even figured out what the Law of Causality was. He only knew that the Life and Death Wind was truly magical, powerful, and dangerous, and any creature that touched it would come face-to-face with death.</p>
