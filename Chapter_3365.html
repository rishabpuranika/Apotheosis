  <p>
</p>

  <p>Phoenix and the others returned to their places too.</p>

  <p>Yan's behavior left them speechless.</p>

  <p>The pieces of the puzzle finally clicked in her mind. It finally dawned on her why Luo Zheng had so many powerful Latent Theurgies, why he showed incredible ability even when he was at an early stage of the Other Shore Realm and why he wasn't afraid of the burning of the divine flames of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>He must have an amazing background!</p>

  <p>But now, Phoenix had a new question.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's sister daring to act so rudely in front of Fuxi, she couldn't help but wonder exactly who their parents were.</p>

  <p>Most of the creatures present were beginning to ask the same question. No one in the Source World could make Fuxi react like this. What kind of background did Luo Zheng and Yan have?</p>

  <p>All the disciples of the Heart Flow Sect, the Unique Array Sword Sect and the Killing Sword Sect were shocked by what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Konnor, that disciple of your Heart Flow Sect seems to have a strong background!" a disciple of the Killing Sword Sect exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he the one who won first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting? He doesn't have a powerful background, does he?" a disciple of the Unique Array Sword Sect asked in a hushed tone.</p>

  <p>Konnor and Milo from the Heart Flow Sect didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>In Konnor's eyes, Luo Zheng was just like Milo, who had worked his way up the Taiyi Heaven Palace on his own merits.</p>

  <p>How would he know if there were some hidden truths behind it?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Chaim and Efrain, the two top talents from the Taiyi Heaven Palace, shot each other a meaningful look.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's talent had made the two of them feel a little discouraged before, but knowing better now, they were at peace with it. There was a reason why Luo Zheng was so outstanding. His background was much stronger than theirs.</p>

  <p>"Brother, after the Chaotic Source World opens, you have to follow my lead, okay?" Yan said to Luo Zheng with a smile, before walking away and standing in a corner with the other members of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, there was a time when Yan's strength had also increased greatly, but she was still someone whom Luo Zheng needed to protect.</p>

  <p>But now, she seemed confident that she was strong enough to protect even Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It appeared that Yan had made great progress in the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that you had a sister," Dorothy said.</p>

  <p>There was a smile in Feng Ge's eyes, like a flame burning in an iceberg. "It seems that your sister is more powerful than you," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan once told Feng Ge that Luo Zheng was a surviving descendant of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>A super force that had already declined, of course, was incomparable to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Feng Ge had felt her background was more superior to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Dorothy felt much the same way.</p>

  <p>But now it seemed they had it all wrong. Luo Zheng was more than a surviving descendant of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, Luo Zheng and his sister were likely to be two of the most important ones.</p>

  <p>"Actually, I don't know what happened." Luo Zheng scratched his head and smiled sheepishly. In fact, the position of Yan in the Li Shan mountain was probably much higher than his in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>After the members of the Li Shan mountain arrived, the people remained waiting.</p>

  <p>After a while, some other flying ships came.</p>

  <p>Some of them belonged to super forces, and some carried other small races.</p>

  <p>There were more and more people now in all corners of the open space.</p>

  <p>It was usual practice that the top masters of the super powers would not lead the teams personally.</p>

  <p>For example, the leaders of the seven mountains of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had never come, and nor had the supreme masters from the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>After the many large races in the Source World had arrived, a large black ship suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Seeing it, Qiu Yinhe, Phoenix and the team leaders of the super forces were taken aback.</p>

  <p>"The Black Ship?"</p>

  <p>"Why are they here?"</p>

  <p>"In the past thousands of years, the Black Ship hasn't trained any new warriors, right?"</p>

  <p>"Have they found an extremely powerful warrior?"</p>

  <p>The Black Ship was a notorious force in the Source World.</p>

  <p>They didn't ally themselves or compromise with any forces.</p>

  <p>They robbed all the other forces, including the powerful ones like the Separate Abyss race and the Bearing race, so they had countless enemies.</p>

  <p>But even though all the forces in the Source World hated them, they remained in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Only once in history had the Black Ship left. That time, they seized an Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty, offending the Ear Mice in the process. The Ear Mice had offered a high reward to all the super forces of the Source World to take the Black Ship down.</p>

  <p>However, even if the top masters of the Source World did everything they could, they were able to kill only one member of the Black Ship. The other members escaped and hid in the chaos for hundreds of years. When they came back, they destroyed a very important branch of the Ear Mice. They also constantly harassed the business teams of the Ear Mice, killing them whenever they saw them.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were the businessmen of the Source World, after all, so they wouldn't spend their days fighting. Moreover, the Black Ship didn't have any fixed stronghold in the Source World. They would flee as soon as they were pressed too hard.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice eventually had no choice but to make peace with the Black Ship. They even gave the Black Ship a generous gift in order to settle the matter.</p>

  <p>It had always been a mystery how many members there actually were in the Black Ship, but it was widely known that one must be a supreme master in the Source World to become one of them.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, the Black Ship would also train new members.</p>

  <p>But the people it chose tended to be monstrously powerful.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship had never come to the Chaotic Source World in recent years, which was why their presence now was so unexpected.</p>

  <p>As the ship flew over everyone's head, a woman in a black dress jumped down and landed firmly on the ground.</p>

  <p>The woman's skin was as white as paper, her face as adorable as a doll's, and her big eyes alluring. However, if you were sensitive enough, you could sense a deadly aura from her.</p>

  <p>She was Shera.</p>

  <p>Fear gripped Phoenix, Qiu Yinhe and the leaders of the other large races.</p>

  <p>The strength of Shera was much stronger than that of Qiu Yinhe and his peers. She was as strong as the heads of the seven mountains and the Five-element Emissaries of the Bearing race. According to practice, such a strong warrior wasn't allowed to enter the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>The moment Shera appeared, Fuxi who had disappeared, came back.</p>

  <p>"I can smell the odor of corpses from you far away. What are you doing here? Get out of here!" Fuxi said, glaring at her with contempt.</p>

  <p>When Shera saw Fuxi, she flashed an innocent smile. She swept back the hem of her dress as she bowed to him, responding sweetly, "You are being too harsh. You know, the most beautiful fragrance in the world is the smell of death."</p>
