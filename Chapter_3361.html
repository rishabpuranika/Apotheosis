<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Icy Snow Province belonged to the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Eleven provinces were under its jurisdiction, all of them lined up.</p>

  <p>Among the eleven provinces, the Icy Snow Province was the farthest from the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Back then, the super forces had allied and forced the Pear Hill to hand over the Chaotic Source Spirits. The Pear Hill couldn't bear the pressure and chose to compromise instead.</p>

  <p>The super forces also required placing the Chaotic Source World in the center of the Source World. But the Pear Hill firmly refused. After several rounds of discussion, they finally gave up the Icy Snow Province, turning it into a public area where the Chaotic Source World was placed.</p>

  <p>Some super forces knew it was a long way to go, so half a year ago, they already set off.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was relatively close to the Icy Snow Province, so it had only taken half a month to arrive.</p>

  <p>The temperature in the Icy Snow Province was extremely low. An ordinary mortal could turn into an ice sculpture in mere seconds.</p>

  <p>But for powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm, the temperature remained normal.</p>

  <p>Even under such harsh conditions, many big cities were built in the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>As they approached the destination, many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace grew excited.</p>

  <p>They gathered in pairs and trios to chat away and exchange information about the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Although this was their first time to enter the Chaotic Source World, some elders of the Oneness Sky Palace had offered them some tips.</p>

  <p>Although they all belonged to the Oneness Mountain, the four factions were greatly different from each other.</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace were the most arrogant. They occupied the very front of the flying ship. One of them even announced,</p>

  <p>"All of us from the Phoenix Palace must unite as one in the Chaotic Source World!"</p>

  <p>"But my elder brother said that those Chaotic Source Spirits are scattered.</p>

  <p>I'm afraid it'll be difficult to capture them if we hold together," another disciple retorted.</p>

  <p>"It depends. Some other races are pretty violent. They'll start killing us mindlessly the moment we enter."</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect occupied the center of the flying ship, while the members of the Flow Sword Sect stayed in the rear with Milo and Konnor in the lead.</p>

  <p>Although the six members of the Nine Li race were also on the ship, they made sure not to go out onto the deck because of their sensitive identity.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the side of the ship. Snowflakes whirled in the sky like a myriad of loose feathers. They dissipated before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source World is a barrier that all the warriors at the Other Shore Realm must face. Yan should be there too. I wonder if we will meet this time," Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He had stayed in the Source World for many years. After losing contact with Emily and the rest, he never saw them again. Looking at the vast snow scene, he felt a faint sadness come over his heart.</p>

  <p>At this time, a snow-white hand stretched out from Zheng's right and caught a snowflake ever so gently. Gradually, it melted in the hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around to find Elvinia standing behind him.</p>

  <p>Her appearance caught everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>She had always been as cold as ice. No one dared to get close to her.</p>

  <p>"My father told me you must be careful in the Chaotic Source World,"</p>

  <p>Elvinia said, watching the white snow in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi?" Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Elvinia nodded in agreement. "The Bearing race will never give up on killing you. Sure, they don't know who you are, but I'm pretty sure they will come to the Chaotic Source World and take actions against you."</p>

  <p>The corporeal body on the Other Shore was a great hindrance for them.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng was formidable in all the thirteen stages. What if he one day reached the Desire World and the higher stages beyond it? It was something none of the Bearing race ever wanted to see.</p>

  <p>There were no rules in the Chaotic Source World. They could kill anyone on a whim.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race had made it to the brink of war. If the Bearing race were to confirm that Tianxing was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, they'd most likely work with the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race in slaughtering all the disciples from the palace.</p>

  <p>This ruthless slaughter would ensure Tianxing's death.</p>

  <p>"They can't do that, can they?" Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Everything is possible," Elvinia said in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>"What about you?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>As a purified being, Elvinia had a physical body on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Everyone could see her face clearly.</p>

  <p>This made her very easy to spot.</p>

  <p>Not being able to hide her identity, she was even more conspicuous than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Compared to him, she was in more danger.</p>

  <p>Elvinia blinked and bared an innocent smile. "You've promised to protect me."</p>

  <p>The smile on her flawless face somehow touched Zheng. Although she had regained her memory, her journey in the Dark Region undoubtedly had a great influence on her. She had become even more approachable.</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't know she acted normally when he wasn't around.</p>

  <p>Because of Liusu, Nelly, and Xun, Elvinia taught the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace a lesson. The disciples who were to enter the Chaotic Source World kept their mouths shut when she was around.</p>

  <p>"Right?" she added.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Zheng said with a helpless nod.</p>

  <p>Elvinia pursed her lips in response before pointing to the front. "Look!"</p>

  <p>A huge ring-like mountain appeared before them.</p>

  <p>Outside it was a land of ice and snow while its interior was covered in a layer of black mist.</p>

  <p>The entire mountain was covered in an enchanted barrier that spanned over three million miles. From afar, it resembled a huge black egg.</p>

  <p>It was none other than the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>There were over a thousand huge stone pillars standing in front of the Chaotic Source World. Each one was engraved with the name of a super force. The flying ship of the Oneness Mountain flew toward its pillar and stopped right by it.</p>

  <p>The flying ships of the other six mountains, including the Origin Mountain, the Golden Mountain, and the Bright Mountain also stopped by the pillar one after another.</p>

  <p>Many flying ships parked beside the pillars. Some were covered in snow. It seemed like they had been there for a long time.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace came down from the flying ships one after another before gathering.</p>

  <p>The six Nine Li people followed closely behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing them, Konnor and the others thought it was rather strange. They didn't belong to the Flow Sword Sect. How did they get there by the flying ship?</p>

  <p>Curious as they were, no one bothered asking questions.</p>

  <p>For each team, a powerful figure was appointed to lead them.</p>

  <p>Athemar was appointed for the Oneness Mountain, while Winchell was chosen for the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>After flying past the many stone pillars under Athemar's leadership, they saw a huge, open area in front of them. The snow had been cleared out and the creatures of many races had occupied their respective corners.</p>
