<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 699 He Was Cheating (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Taking Yudie's stand and judgment of the level 12 archers, it shouldn't be hard for Luo Zheng to pass the test.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was again, relaxed. He had this one covered. Suddenly, the lights that were shining on Luo Zheng faded. The light sky in the magic array was replaced by darkness. The sky and the meadow gradually disappeared in front of Luo Zheng. Even Luo Zheng could not see clearly everything around him!</p>

  <p>"I've moved to the second level," Luo Zheng told himself.</p>

  <p>Everything was vanishing fast but one -- the tower. Luo Zheng stood petrified at the sight of the tower which floated in the sea of darkness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, other towers showed up one after another, leaving some distance between them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had faith in his victory. Nothing could make him fail the test. After all, he had a lot of potential. What was this all about? Was this the second part of the pre-qualifying test? He counted, one.. two... three... There were 21 towers in total, including his. What he saw were all survivors standing on their own towers.</p>

  <p>"What is going on with that guy? His tower� why is his tower so huge?"</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible? Did he cheat on the test? All of our towers are level 10. Why is his twice larger than mine?!"</p>

  <p>"Unless his is level 11, or even level 12! But how could he gain extra points in this magic array? How was that possible? How did he upgrade his tower to level 12?"</p>

  <p>Other cultivators stared at Luo Zheng and murmured, whispers flying everywhere.</p>

  <p>When they saw Zheng's gigantic tower, they found it was not something along their level. It was a fortress. The cultivators exchanged glances and repeatedly compared their towers to Zheng's. These cultivators risked their lives for their upgrades.</p>

  <p>What they saw made them feel unfair and cheated.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?! How did he do that?" Standing on his level 10 tower, Owen was confused and he stared at Luo Zheng oddly. Anyone like Owen, as a cultivator at the consummation of Illuminating Soul Realm, would be very proud of themselves if they could pass many rounds of beast attacks. He worked hard to achieve this.</p>

  <p>But Owen wasn't proud of himself at all. He came all the way to the magic array from Woollen Grassland to get into the main draw match. As for the pre-qualifying test, it was another obstacle that he had to get through. Owen was more determined to get into the main draw match than anyone could ever imagine.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, anyone who got into the second part was supposed to have at least level 10 tower. Therefore, when Owen saw Zheng's level 12 tower, he was disappointed at himself.</p>

  <p>Owen recognized Luo Zheng. He remembered meeting Luo Zheng earlier, who was at the third grade of Illuminating Soul Realm. This annoyed Owen so much that it was almost consuming him. But Owen knew better. He stayed cool all throughout.</p>

  <p>'Is it because of the World Commercial Alliance? Did they do something to help this guy? This is unfair!' Owen was suspicious of Luo Zheng. After all, Zheng's tower was just so� cool. A thought kept on repeating on Owen's head.</p>

  <p>How was Luo Zheng able to do it?</p>

  <p>And Owen wasn't the only one who noticed this suspicious scene.</p>

  <p>"I thought that the World Commercial Alliance was fair. Turns out that I was wrong. That's low!"</p>

  <p>"Shame on him! Even if he gets into the main draw match, I won't congratulate him. I bet even the pre-qualifying test is an excuse. They can choose anyone to get into the main draw match as they want! This is unfair!"</p>

  <p>"I'm gonna teach that guy a lesson. I'm going to defeat him and get his tower!"</p>

  <p>No one would attack Luo Zheng at this state. But since Luo Zheng was in level three of the Illuminating Soul Realm, they thought he was easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>Besides, anyone who could get Zheng's tower could easily beat down other competitors! If they could defeat Luo Zheng, they could defeat anyone standing in their way.</p>

  <p>But the battle hadn't started yet. Among the 22 towers, only 3 shall remain.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to the participants, there was an invisible power which limited all cultivators' movement. Despite this, their target was clear: defeat Luo Zheng and get his tower. Luo Zheng didn't want to be in this position. After all, he stayed out of trouble, at least, he tried to. But because of his tower, all eyes were now on him. Luo Zheng was the target.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the other cultivators looked at him, Luo Zheng could not think of any other thing but regret. He saw the jealousy and rage on others' faces. Had he not upgraded his tower to level 12, he would not be in this position.</p>

  <p>"Let the battle begin!"</p>

  <p>Cole announced. Four cultivators who were closest to Luo Zheng jumped to him immediately.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng furrowed his brows, nervous. Cold sweat started to run down his skin as the Demon Night with a huge sword stood in front of him. Determined, Luo Zheng waved his hand and the twelve archers raised their bows and arrows.</p>

  <p>The archers did as they were told, like soldiers in the forefront of the battlefield. Luo Zheng wanted to win so bad. Now it was time to defend his fortress. Regret was down the drain. What remained was his fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>A master in Virtual Tribulation Realm could easily defeat numerous cultivators in Internal Elixir Realm. This only meant one thing -- Zheng's tower should be able to withstand the attacks and defeat them. The archers in level 10 tower were just mere cultivators in the middle phase of Internal Elixir Realm. Luo Zheng was much more powerful than them. He had a big chance of smelling victory in the air.</p>

  <p>"Woosh, woosh, woosh�"</p>

  <p>Off went the twelve powerful and swift arrows.</p>

  <p>As soon as the arrows were launched, one by one the arrows landed on the other cultivators' towers, destroying them, reducing the towers into ash in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Other cultivators were scared. Silence roamed the atmosphere. Seeing the towers reduced to nothing but ashes made them feel threatened. It came to their senses that in this magic array, Luo Zheng was the king. Luo Zheng was undefeatable.</p>
