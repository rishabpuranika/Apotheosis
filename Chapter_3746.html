<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to the Calculation Civilization's assumption, the Energy Shaft's transformation ability was virtually infinite.</p>

  <p>In theory, after mastering the completed Energy Shaft, one would then possess infinite power.</p>

  <p>Not to mention the power of about a hundred and sixty million divine megatons, even the power of a billion divine megatons could be transformed and released.</p>

  <p>"It's such a pity that in the period of the Calculation Civilization, the end of the chaotic era arrived when plan of using Energy Shaft finalized. We couldn't set it in motion at the time?" the green figure remarked.</p>

  <p>"So instead, you shared the method to obtain the Energy Shaft, right?" asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the green figure. "Back then, we were in despair, so we placed our hope on other civilizations."</p>

  <p>Many other ruling civilizations on the Other Shore had the tendency to exclude other races.</p>

  <p>They believed that anyone not part of their own race would be disloyal.</p>

  <p>They were vigilant and always on guard against other races. And so after many ruling civilizations on the Other Shore set up their own temples, it grew difficult for them to advance to higher levels.</p>

  <p>Some of the rules and theurgies they grasped were hidden in the temples as treasures? at the time, they weren't willing to spread them out.</p>

  <p>However, the Calculation Civilization was very open-minded. They hoped that other civilizations could do what they failed to.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, most of the later civilizations regarded the Energy Shaft as merely an untouchable thing. Many civilizations grew skeptical of it.</p>

  <p>In truth, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also felt that the Energy Shaft was an unreachable kind of fantasy. But the plan was feasible, in the end. And so he stuffed it into Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree before passing it onto this chaotic era.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, not a single civilization believed in us. We could only rely on ourselves. And so we opened the second chaotic era? the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," said the green figure.</p>

  <p>"I want to know how you opened the second chaotic era," asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>After all, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization owned the Civilization Artifact, so it should have also been a highly prosperous ruling civilization.</p>

  <p>The situation likely differed from the human race's current situation.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was rather curious about it.</p>

  <p>"Our control over life should go beyond your comprehension," continued the green figure. "Our bodies are small, so perhaps we're at an advantage.</p>

  <p>At the micro level, we found many sources of life, along with the things that make up these sources."</p>

  <p>As it spoke, a small ball appeared on the wall.</p>

  <p>It changed from one to two, two to four, four to eight, and so on. As it continued splitting, it became a densely packed group of small balls that formed many young lives.</p>

  <p>On the picture were wolves, elephants, and all sorts of strange beasts.</p>

  <p>"Is life formed by these small balls? What about our human race?" Li Bianxue's eyes widened in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"They also form human beings," replied the green figure.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?" Li Bianxue couldn't help but shake her head in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Now, I can make a scene so you can take a look..."</p>

  <p>Soon after, the picture on the wall returned to a single small ball, similar to the previous picture. As it continued splitting, countless small balls were formed, each then turning into an extremely young individual? the human embryo.</p>

  <p>The embryo grew rapidly until it became a baby waiting for delivery.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Phoenix, and Li Bianxue were all amazed. The Primeval Lord of Heaven, on the other hand, seemed rather calm and unsurprised.</p>

  <p>It wasn't particularly difficult to observe the process of a baby's growth, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't expect the baby to form from a tiny ball. What he wanted to know was how the Calculation Civilization ended up becoming the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>"As you can see, all the creatures are formed by small balls after they split.</p>

  <p>So long as the information inside the original ball is modified, we're likely to get our desired results," the green figure said.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven's expression shifted slightly as he asked,</p>

  <p>"Then you've revised it..."</p>

  <p>"Yes," it said faintly. "We modified the balls at the beginning of another chaotic era. When the balls split, the race they formed turned out to be our Calculation Civilization. We were rich in experience and time, so we thought we could easily realize the plan of Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>However, we underestimated the power of the Sons of Truth and the strength of the Element Spirit race."</p>

  <p>The green figure's voice seemed rather lonely and disappointed.</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore, the Calculation Civilization had always kept a low profile. Who would pay attention to a group of insects, after all?</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization completely ignored the Calculation Civilization. They didn't even bother suppressing this race in the least.</p>

  <p>According to the assessment of the Element Spirit Civilization, the latter was likely the weakest ruling civilization.</p>

  <p>The Calculation Civilization managed to become the ruling civilization merely because, at the time, there were no other powerful races in that round of chaos.</p>

  <p>But the appearance of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly aroused the Element Spirit race's vigilance.</p>

  <p>The latter found that these insects were not as simple as they seemed. After the Element Spirit race realized it, they began rigorously suppressing the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the civilization that existed before the Heavenly Obsession Civilization chose to pay allegiance to the Element Spirit race. And so the Sons of Truth selected in the previous civilization naturally fell under the Element Spirit race's command.</p>

  <p>While fighting the Sons of Truth, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization tried creating the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>"In the end, all our efforts were in vain," said the green figure in return, shaking its head. "It didn't matter when the Sons of Truth suppressed us.</p>

  <p>Although our Calculation Civilization was small, our absolute strength was powerful enough to fight against them. We already managed to control those Sons of Truth in the second chaotic era...</p>

  <p>Our real problem still lies on the Other Shore," continued the green figure.</p>

  <p>"The plan of Energy Shaft required the help of the Other Shore. But the Element Spirit race was too strong for us to fight against. The ones heading for Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore were too weak, so in the end, even the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was frozen."</p>

  <p>The Calculation Civilization was a race known to group together? they needed countless individuals to grow strong.</p>

  <p>Entering Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, one needed to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. Not many individuals could enter it.</p>

  <p>In the entire Calculation Civilization, only about twenty had entered Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But they were individuals barely as big as mosquitoes. What was their use?</p>

  <p>"At that time, you guys could cultivate to become the Wild Gods. Your body size shouldn't be a problem, right?" Luo Zheng asked as he wondered.</p>

  <p>"We were used to cultivating and fighting together. Even if we turned into huge creatures hundreds of thousands of times bigger than before, we still couldn't display our original strength," the green figure simply said.</p>

  <p>"So you were focused on the Energy Shaft at the time? What about the Ways-blending Energy?" Luo Zheng asked further.</p>
