<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3216 Unexpected Guests </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sat in the dark cave. The lid above opened once again, allowing a ray of light to pierce through from above.</p>

  <p>"Come up!" a strange voice whispered from the entrance of the cave.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who sat cross legged, turned a deaf ear to the voice.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>An invisible force drew Luo Zheng up from the bottom of the cave and he fell into the palace with a thud.</p>

  <p>Pushing himself to his feet, he found Natasha standing not far off. He smiled at her and said, "We meet again."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's fearlessness upset Natasha to her core.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe and Goran had arrived at the Vastness Mountain too soon. Time was running out.</p>

  <p>Barnaby had been practicing on the Other Shore. Natasha had forced him to leave it for now to join her.</p>

  <p>"Barnaby, we need your help. But don't kill him," Natasha called out.</p>

  <p>A tall, thick man appeared from behind Natasha.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in a white robe, with eyes drawn on it. The eyes seemed embedded in the robe and were unnervingly real.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Lady Natasha. He is just a young man in the Lust World,"</p>

  <p>Barnaby said with a slight smirk.</p>

  <p>She wanted to remind him of what had happened to Arjun, but given his cultivation base and strength, she thought he should have no difficulty in dealing with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tensed up with caution when he saw Barnaby.</p>

  <p>Arjun, one of the best warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, had been very powerful in Luo Zheng's eyes. But he was unable to figure out Barnaby's real strength. He figured Barnaby was probably as strong as Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>Barnaby smiled nicely as he walked up to Luo Zheng, which was very disconcerting. "Once a creature is born, it will have its memory. But it's only a dream. Just relax. This can be very easy."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, seven eyes on his white robe snapped open. They didn't look like eyes on a robe anymore; they looked real.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked into them and a trance immediately overtook him.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Don't look into the eyes!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart seized as he closed his eyes as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>When they were closed, everything else disappeared but the eyes. They kept coming closer and closer.</p>

  <p>"It's useless, Luo Zheng. It's the Illusory Eyes. Closing your eyes won't help," said No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"Then what should I do?" Luo Zheng asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>His techniques and understanding in the soul level were quite limited.</p>

  <p>"The Flow Swordsmanship may help you resist them, but unfortunately, you haven't fully mastered it yet. This is troublesome. You can try the Authentic Visual World," No. 9527 suggested.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 knew how to deal with those as powerful as Arjun, but it couldn't defeat a powerhouse like Barnaby. It could only offer ideas.</p>

  <p>"I can create the happiest illusion, and make the fragile strong. This new world will be amazing for you," Barnaby whispered gently, as if Luo Zheng was a close friend he cared for greatly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still wore the same dreamy look on his face.</p>

  <p>It was as if he had returned to the divine land and established a new great clan in the center of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>He no longer pursued ultimate power and never experienced hardships.</p>

  <p>Natasha's lips curled into a sneer. "You're indeed an amazing master, Barnaby. This stubborn man is no match for you."</p>

  <p>Barnaby paid her words no mind and turned to look at her. He smiled and lifted a finger to shush her. "Lady Natasha, please don't make a sound. It will be done soon."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng opened his eyes, and the demonic eye in his inner world was activated. A white light flashed in his right eye.</p>

  <p>All the illusions shattered into pieces. He was no longer in a trance and his eyes cleared.</p>

  <p>"That was close! I was almost trapped!" Luo Zheng broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>The faces of Natasha and Barnaby froze.</p>

  <p>Barnaby stared at Luo Zheng, full of disbelief and confusion.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful masters at the Chaotic Source Realm who had stepped into the Desire World found it impossible to break his illusions. How could Luo Zheng, who had just stepped into the Lust World, accomplish it?</p>

  <p>"Barnaby, what's going on?" Natasha asked.</p>

  <p>She didn't know how much longer Gethin could stall. Time was running out; there was no room for error.</p>

  <p>"It's just a small hiccup," Barnaby said, sizing Luo Zheng up. "He probably has an Other Shore Token capable of destroying the illusions."</p>

  <p>An Other Shore Token of that kind was very rare. Barnaby was startled to learn Luo Zheng had one.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Natasha asked, frowning intensely and staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," Barnaby reassured her confidently. He then slowly lifted his white robe.</p>

  <p>The eyes on it opened one after another.</p>

  <p>Inside the Mighty Sword Hall, a powerful aura filled the air.</p>

  <p>Gethin still sat in his golden throne, like a slumbering dragon, ready to devour anything that dared disturb him.</p>

  <p>Black fog began gradually spreading from the shadows beside him, the killing intent wandering along it. Suddenly, two leaders of the intelligence agency appeared.</p>

  <p id="top_24">"Qiu Yinhe, life has been too smooth for you these past years. It seems you have forgotten who you are!" Gethin flared with anger. "I'd like to see how you manage to walk out of here today!"</p>

  <p>Sensing the killing intent in the black fog, Goran was on high alert and more cautious than ever.</p>

  <p>If Gethin really took action, Qiu Yinhe and Goran would be too weak to fight back.</p>

  <p>Just then, another person could be heard walking in from outside the Mighty Sword Hall.</p>

  <p>He had a pair of bright piercing eyes. It was none other than Winchell of the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Gathin laughed grimly when he saw Winchell. "Oh? The Origin Mountain wants to get involved too?" he asked, sniggering.</p>

  <p>Winchell cupped his hands to Gethin and said, "Goran is my best friend. I have to stand by his side and help if I am needed."</p>

  <p>"It's not enough. It's far from enough for the three of you to do anything here," said Gethin, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Although Winchell was not a Taiyi Governor, he was almost as strong as Qiu Yinhe and Goran. But they were far from being able to contend with Gethin, even if they worked together. Moreover, there were countless masters in the Vastness Mountain. The two leaders of the intelligence agency, for example, were not weak.</p>

  <p>"Is it enough if I join them?" an old voice asked.</p>

  <p>A stooping old woman came in from the door of the Mighty Sword Hall, clutching a thin walking stick.</p>

  <p>"Grandma, slow down," Dorothy said, holding the old woman by her arm as she walked her in slowly.</p>

  <p>When Gethin saw the old woman, the corners of his eyes twitched.</p>

  <p>Gethin had decided that nothing and no one would stand in his way of getting the Truth Enlightenment. However, the old woman's arrival had startled him to be sure. This was going to be a tough situation.</p>
