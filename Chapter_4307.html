<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4307 More Avatars </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God clearly knew the gap in strength between himself, Zheng, and the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Even with the energy of the Source World, he could only hold on for a few rounds in the battle against the two.</p>

  <p>Right now, he could only sacrifice the materials from the Source World to sustain his energy. It had become a battle of limited resources against infinite energy. Sooner or later, the Evil God would exhaust everything that he had and would be overcome either by Zheng or the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for the Evil God, the intensity of the energy he could release in a round was by no means inferior to that of his two opponents. Now, his only problem was where to find more resources to cope with them.</p>

  <p>As he was trying to explore more sources of energy, he was also using the Field to expand the Source World indefinitely. If he made the entire chaos a part of the Source World, then everything in it would belong to him, and he would be able to use them however he wanted.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw the energy flow that suddenly erupted from the Burial Land, the Evil God was stunned.</p>

  <p>'What the hell? Where does that terrifying amount of energy come from?'</p>

  <p>The energy flow occurred within the scope of the Source World, and the Evil God estimated it using his omniscient power.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, as he discerned the flowing energy, he felt like his chest was smashed by a heavy hammer.</p>

  <p>Then, he found out that to release this energy flow, about sixty thousand Source Worlds would have to be sacrificed.</p>

  <p>In other words, even if he decided to sacrifice the entire Source World, the power that he would acquire would almost be negligible against what his opponents possessed.</p>

  <p>His throat felt dry and a bitter taste rose from it. In an instant, his arrogance vanished, knowing how pitiful his current state was.</p>

  <p>"Shall we continue to enclose more lands?" one of the avatars cautiously asked as he noticed the bad mood of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Evil God answered briefly, then quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a huge square platform floating on the belt of the Source World. On it, tens of thousands of avatars of the Evil God were gathered.</p>

  <p>Light energy bands floated around the platform that formed huge fences, sealing the entire platform into what looked like a huge prison.</p>

  <p>With this, an avatar that wanted to escape from it would be instantly killed. Moreover, since the space was locked, they were unable to use the Grand Teleportation skill.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there was a fierce argument going on inside the prison.</p>

  <p>"Energy and materials are just two sides of the same coin. This is an ironclad law!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! If there aren't enough materials, then there won't be enough energy to produce!"</p>

  <p>"Bullshit! The transformation of materials and energy only looks like this in lower-grade worlds. How do you think Zheng and the downgrader acquire so much energy?! There must be a shortcut to obtain infinite energy in higher-grade worlds!"</p>

  <p>"Then, we have to restore the energy as soon as possible. It's the only way to find this shortcut."</p>

  <p>The prison was very noisy as the avatars debated on how they could turn their situation against Zheng and the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Every avatar hysterically expressed their opinions. They only came from a single person but their ideas collided with each other. It was actually a good thing, so they could arrive at the best conclusion.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran were standing guard at the prison gate and were listening to the avatars' conversation.</p>

  <p>The two of them were greatly shocked at the intelligence displayed by each of them.</p>

  <p>With so many of them, their brainstorming became more efficient.</p>

  <p>Judging by their progress, it might not be too long before the avatars could realize how to find the shortcut that they badly needed.</p>

  <p>While they were listening intently, they didn't notice the grains of sand that were slowly floating out of the prison.</p>

  <p>Apparently, these grains of sand were from an avatar, who did not wish to participate in the others' discussion. Instead, he quietly sat in a corner and gradually turned his body into fine sand.</p>

  <p>The sand drifted little by little towards the prison gate, forming a thin layer, while the avatar's body was continuously shrinking.</p>

  <p>"Hey, why is there so much sand on the ground?"</p>

  <p>Finally, the Grandmaster of Heaven inadvertently noticed the thin layer of sand on the ground. He and Duran were always on high alert. If it was just ordinary sand that fell on the ground, they should have noticed it at once.</p>

  <p>As they wondered and inspected the sand, it suddenly condensed into the avatar of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Since the avatars were almost the exact copies of the original, they had no way to determine whether he was the real Evil God or not. Just when they were about to ask him, the Evil God reached out his hand and gently waved at Duran. An invisible film instantly enveloped Duran, and at the same time, the avatar also stretched his other hand and grabbed the Grandmaster of Heaven by his neck.</p>

  <p>"I've actually been coveting your body for a long time now. If I want to be free from the real Evil God, I need to possess your body shell," the avatar said with a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>Since the avatar could also use the Extreme Form energies, Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven were no match for him.</p>

  <p>"You bastard? The real Evil God is omniscient and omnipotent. Even if you take away my body shell, he will know instantly. Don't think that you can get away with this!" the Grandmaster of Heaven said in gritted teeth as he struggled to remove the hand of the avatar from his neck.</p>

  <p>"Omniscient? Omnipotent? Ha! The power of the third-grade world is nothing! Do you think I can't deceive him?" As he finished speaking, he didn't waste any time and began stealing the body of the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Soul Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>However, as the Extreme Form energy started activating, the real Evil God suddenly appeared above the avatar and stomped him to the ground.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The avatar's body immediately collapsed into grains of sand and quickly flowed to escape.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Where do you think you're going?"</p>

  <p>The real Evil God snorted as he released several balls of flames that darted towards the sand.</p>

  <p>The flames quickly caught up with the sand and engulfed it.</p>

  <p>The painful roars of the avatar could be clearly heard from within the flames. As the sound dissipated after a while, the sand was burnt and was turned into a piece of smooth and transparent glass.</p>

  <p>"Your avatars are really troublesome," the Grandmaster of Heaven said as he still gasped for air from being strangled by the avatar.</p>

  <p>The real Evil God just shook his head and turned to look inside the prison.</p>

  <p>"I have no choice. I can't risk placing unwarranted fear in their minds."</p>

  <p>"Huh? Why not? Won't it be necessary so you could control them properly?" Duran asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God pointed at his head and said, "If they got too scared and paranoid, they would lose their imagination and creativity. Those are what we need from them. It'll be over if we lose that."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran understood him.</p>

  <p>"Hey!"</p>

  <p>An avatar suddenly greeted the Evil God through the fence and gently pulled his hands together. At the same time, a pale red band of light slowly rotated around him. "I have found a new Field, and the creatures within it will fall into the chaos."</p>

  <p>The number of Fields that he was talking about was eighty-six.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the avatars were very efficient. They found several Fields in such a short time. After they figured out the rules, their speed became so much faster, and it could still improve.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God still wasn't satisfied.</p>

  <p>Then, he slowly ascended to the top of the prison, looked down at the avatars below, and said, "You've done a good job, but it still isn't enough.</p>

  <p>We're running out of time. I just saw a powerful energy flow from the Burial Land. We're in a very tight spot."</p>

  <p>"How powerful is it?" one of the avatars asked.</p>

  <p>"It's equivalent to the energy of the combined sixty thousand Source Worlds," the Evil God said straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>An uproar suddenly rose from inside the prison.</p>

  <p>The jaws of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran dropped hard. They even asked each other if they heard the same thing.</p>

  <p>"In short, they have an infinite source of energy. We have no chance of winning if we just rely on the Fields. I need you to find out the energy source and the shortcut to control it. I need more intelligence and more avatars."</p>

  <p>After the Evil God finished addressing them, the belt of the Source World began to tremble. He was planning to sacrifice everything in order to get what he wanted.</p>
