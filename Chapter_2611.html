  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Cyan Shadow Hall stood over a hundred True Gods.</p>

  <p>About half of them were disciples from this Floating Island.</p>

  <p>While the other half came from the Dongfang Clan who resided at the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>Compared with other powerful clans on the Floating Islands, the Dongfang Clan had an especially strong foundation and their recommended disciples couldn't be ignored. In other words, even if the Dongfang Clan didn't rely on the Floating Island, they could still cultivate outstanding young warriors who were comparable to the disciples from the Floating Island!</p>

  <p>When Nicholas made his presence, all the disciples of the Dongfang Clan had great reverence on their faces.</p>

  <p>They knew that this burly middle-aged man was the leader of the Dongfang Clan and the most powerful Holy Being in the divine land!</p>

  <p>But perhaps the title of the most powerful Holy Being wasn't completely right.</p>

  <p>After all, the Holy Beings wouldn't fight with each other easily. Some Holy Beings would hold back their strength and they might even be more powerful than Nicholas.</p>

  <p>But on the surface, most of the True Gods thought that Nicholas was the strongest!</p>

  <p>"Greetings! Holy Nicholas!"</p>

  <p>The young warriors in the hall all bowed.</p>

  <p>"That our Dongfang Clan can stand on the top of the Floating Islands is not because of me alone, but all the elites present here. You are the future of our Dongfang Clan." Nicholas looked down at the crowd and nodded.</p>

  <p>"According to the rules of our clan, we will reward the best disciples every once in a while. This time, I will personally reward the best disciples."</p>

  <p>All the young warriors' eyes lit up in great interest.</p>

  <p>Everyone present recently had the best performance. They either had abundant harvest in the forbidden areas, or made a great contribution to their clan, or showed astonishing abilities and strong potential in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>The reward would be presented by the master of the clan this time so they were all especially excited.</p>

  <p>On the side of the hall, a Demi-holy Being from the Dongfang Clan quietly walked to Nicholas' side and whispered something in his ears.</p>

  <p>Just as Nicholas was listening, his eyes fell to a corner of the hall.</p>

  <p>Others also noticed Nicholas' gaze and they secretly followed his eyes.</p>

  <p>There at the corner stood a young man in white.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Nicholas spoke with a smile, "The Ray Tree is a place with many talents. It's a great honor for our Dongfang Clan to have such a young outer elite. Your name's Lowell, right?"</p>

  <p>Murmurs broke out when everyone in the hall heard Nicholas' words.</p>

  <p>"Lowell? He's Lowell?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect Lowell to be a disciple of our Dongfang Clan on the Floating Island, and he's an outer disciple..."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering which clan he came from..."</p>

  <p>They didn't think that someone who had firmly taken the first place among the top-rank True Gods in the Arena of Legends would be at the corner. It was even said that he was going to challenge consummate True Gods who were on a higher level than him!</p>

  <p>But no one knew which clan this guy belonged to.</p>

  <p>Some people who didn't even know the truth managed to guess that Lowell was the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>Now that he suddenly appeared on the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island and joined them in the hall, it startled all the disciples.</p>

  <p>Admiration, envy, and even hatred. The disciples looked at Lowell with varying emotions. After all, in order to climb to the top, Lowell defeated some of the present disciples from the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Lowell cupped his hands toward Nicholas. "Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Good!" Nicholas said approvingly. "You have been able to win all the way without a single defeat so far. Through the divine eras, you are one of the best."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, an imperceptible trace of gloom appeared in Nicholas' eyes.</p>

  <p>No Holy Being in the past had ever reached Lowell's record of twenty-nine consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>But when it came to record of consecutive wins, it was inevitable for Nicholas to think of the anonymous man, Zheng!</p>

  <p>Last time in the underground world, Lorena sent Zheng away with some theurgy.</p>

  <p>It upset Nicholas that he didn't find Zheng anywhere in the divine land because he was a man who would never give up easily.</p>

  <p>He had deep hatred towards Zheng and he wanted to eliminate him. His intense hatred came from the mere fact that Zheng was the son of Mike and Lorena and this was what depressed him most. How could he tolerate his existence?</p>

  <p>As a man, no matter how generous he was, he was doomed to be narrow-minded in this situation!</p>

  <p>"I hope you can put forth more effort and set a record of the most consecutive wins."</p>

  <p>With that, Nicholas reached out and clenched his hand. Two rays of light, one cyan and the other yellow, slowly spiraled up from his hand and turned into two swords.</p>

  <p>The disciples who saw the two swords began to whisper to each other.</p>

  <p>"They're the Cyan Yellow Double Swords."</p>

  <p>"The cyan sword represents the five spirits and the yellow sword represents the half moon. How could the master give those to an outsider like him?!"</p>

  <p>"This isn't right. Lowell doesn't even use double swords. Why would the master give him such a reward?"</p>

  <p>The Cyan Yellow Double Swords slowly floated in the hands of Nicholas. His eyes fell on the woman next to Lowell.</p>

  <p>Even when just standing in her three colored dress, she looked like a pure beauty filled with vigor and vitality.</p>

  <p>"Iris Dongfang, you're Winthrop's daughter, right? Send my regards to your father. Your branch trained such an excellent female warrior. Very good! This pair of Cyan Yellow Double Swords are rewarded to you two." Nicholas smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>Iris was the girl Lowell had saved before.</p>

  <p>She followed him ever since.</p>

  <p>But she became too reliant on him and couldn't live without him even when she had the chance to return to the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>In Iris' eyes, Lowell was always so mysterious.</p>

  <p>It was because of that mystery that she was attracted enough to ignore everything. Up till now, she still couldn't see through him.</p>

  <p>Although there were dangers in introducing a mysterious stranger into the Dongfang Clan, Lowell must have his reasons to suddenly require to join the Dongfang Clan. Nevertheless, she still willingly helped Lowell hide everything, such as the fact that he could appallingly eat the slate.</p>

  <p>For others, it looked like Lowell was able to enter the Floating Island by playing up to Iris and if they got married, he would be a member of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>But Iris knew that it was the other way around. In fact, she was subservient to him.</p>

  <p>"Kids, take the swords and show your gratitude to the master!" the Demi-Holy Being urged.</p>

  <p>A gentle smile was on Lowell's lips as he cupped his hands and Iris followed his action.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Holy Nicholas!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Holy Nicholas!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas flicked his finger and the pair of Cyan Yellow Double Swords shot towards them.</p>
