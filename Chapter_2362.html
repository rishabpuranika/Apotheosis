<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nelly was akin to many other talents of the rich clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Her life was pre-planned from the day she was born.</p>

  <p>She practiced hard day and night and admired her sister very much. She paid little to no heed to the stuff that was going on around her. Her sole aim was to become the second Rachelle of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>She seldom appreciated other good things in life.</p>

  <p>However, these days were unlike the rest. She felt as if the time had slowed down for her, and her feelings to the occurrences around her were completely different than usual.</p>

  <p>"That snake is too cruel. Why does it have to feed on small boys and girls?" Nelly said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Zheng threw her a casual glance and said, "Since when did you become so sentimental?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not!" Nelly glared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng calmly looked at the mother and son and said, "These things happen all the time in the divine land and in the universes. On the other hand, it's quite understandable if it surprises you."</p>

  <p>Nelly's heart skipped a beat when she heard Zheng's words. She looked at him with a complicated expression on her face.</p>

  <p>Her sister had told her that Zheng was a stowaway from the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>He must have experienced a great deal of things on his way from the universe to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Her curiosity for Zheng deepened as she developed a strange feeling regarding the whole situation.</p>

  <p>The very next day, the selected children were carried onto the backs of the eagles.</p>

  <p>Then, hundreds of eagles took off from the Eagle Castle.</p>

  <p>Leading the flock were thirteen Royal Eagles. Zheng and Nelly were seated on two different Royal Eagles.</p>

  <p>Under the leadership of the chief, they flew some distance to the northwest. After a while, they were greeted by a circular mountain.</p>

  <p>It was a dead volcano. Hundreds of years' weathering and erosion had turned its crater into a beautiful lake. Many eagles landed around the lake. The people of the Eagle race had finally reached their destination.</p>

  <p>The Eagle race was divided into five tribes: the Vision Tribe, the Myth Tribe, the Edge Tribe, the Collar Tribe, and the Cape Tribe.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Nelly were with the Vision Tribe.</p>

  <p>"Why do we have two outsiders among us?" the leader of the Edge Tribe demanded, staring at Zheng and Nelly.</p>

  <p>Besides Zheng and Nelly, there were also the consummate True Gods and other True Gods who had entered this world.</p>

  <p>The Eagle race were wary of the intruders. Just like Nelly, some of the True Gods were capable of killing people without saying much.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the natives were ultimately inclined to defend themselves.</p>

  <p>The Edge Tribe was attacked by two True Gods a while ago, and it took eleven Royal Eagles to kill those two True Gods.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they were quite careful as to whom they were letting in.</p>

  <p>"They are our friends," said the leader of the Vision Tribe.</p>

  <p>"Friends? They're enemies to us."</p>

  <p>"They are not allowed to enter the Heavenly Wheel Temple. If they provoke the snake, our whole race will go extinct."</p>

  <p>The other four tribal chiefs objected.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Vision Tribe was well aware that he'd face such protests. He gave Zheng a swift glance.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave him a nod. The leader of the Vision Tribe then led the other four tribal chiefs to the side and took out the pills.</p>

  <p>Moments later, they all came back. Their expressions were different from what they had earlier.</p>

  <p>These pills were of great importance to them. If they went to the Heavenly Wheel Temple with Zheng and Nelly, they could acquire these magical pills. Therefore, it was undoubtedly worthwhile for them to make a deal with Zheng and Nelly. Thus, the tribal leaders kept quiet and didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>They then gave a sharp cry, ordering everyone to get back on the eagles.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by melodious flute music, all the eagles spread their wings and took off. The scenes that everyone was witnessing were breathtaking.</p>

  <p>With a phew, an eagle flew to the front of the group in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>This eagle was smaller than the rest of the eagles. A blood-red dark light glittered on the feathers covering its neck. It threw a casual look at Zheng as it passed him.</p>

  <p>"That eagle is so fierce," said Nelly, staring at the little eagle.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement. The adult Royal Eagles from the Eagle race posed a great threat to him. But if they ever fought, Zheng was quite sure that he'd come out on top.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't sure if he'd be able to defeat this little Royal Eagle.</p>

  <p>Yet still, he had confidence in his abilities and was sure that it'd be quite hard for that eagle to hurt him, let alone kill him.</p>

  <p>Thousands of eagles took to the skies, and the screams of the children were heard now and then.</p>

  <p>Seventeen children were selected by the five tribes of the Eagle race.</p>

  <p>They were clearly enjoying the ride ever since the beginning.</p>

  <p>But as time passed and the view began to bore them, they started to scream.</p>

  <p>All the men from Eagle race wore a serious expression on their faces. It looked as if they quite often experienced this kind of life and death parting.</p>

  <p>Then the eagles dove towards the ground as they had to take a short rest.</p>

  <p>While everyone relaxed, Nelly saw a boy crying and shouting desperately for his mother. Nelly took out a small colorful mirror much to the boy's delight. He immediately stopped crying when she handed him the mirror.</p>

  <p>When the eagles took off again, the boy shared an eagle with Nelly as she cradled him in her arms.</p>

  <p>Zheng witnessed the huge sea of bugs again after several hours of flying.</p>

  <p>The gigantic bugs were still present in their natural habitat and were wriggling continuously.</p>

  <p>"Ah! What huge bugs!" Nelly exclaimed as she looked down in astonishment.</p>

  <p>After she entered this world, she directly appeared in the territory of the Eagle race. Thus, she could consider herself luckier than Zheng as she had never come across these Heavenly Wheel Bugs before.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng knew quite a lot about this world, he still wasn't sure as to where these bugs came from.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Bugs were ferocious beings whose presence could not be ignored, not even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>As the saying goes, "It is difficult for a flood dragon to leap in shallow water, difficult for a tiger to survive in flat land." Therefore, seeing a few of such giant bugs in this world was surprising enough, not to mention that their numbers were in thousands. Thus, their presence was quite mysterious to comprehend.</p>

  <p>After crossing the sea of bugs, they flew over a valley that looked like a scar. Shortly afterwards, the vast desert returned.</p>

  <p>Since the eagles' physical strength was limited, they had to take a break after flying for two or three hours.</p>

  <p>The Eagle members often herded eagles in the desert, so they were quite familiar with the route.</p>

  <p>After two long days and nights, the people on the backs of the eagles finally saw brownish-yellow buildings in the bare desert.</p>

  <p>It looked as if those brownish-yellow buildings were part of a city.</p>

  <p>Almost all the buildings of the city had collapsed, leaving only bare walls. The sand and the time had changed everything.</p>

  <p>In the center of the city stood a huge altar, behind which was a lofty hall.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the tribal leaders' words, all the eagles descended, withdrew their wings and landed on the altar.</p>

  <p>Zheng jumped off the back of his eagle and carefully examined the altar.</p>

  <p>At the center of the altar, a statue of a huge black snake was erected. The snake resembled the one on the jade seal.</p>

  <p>"It's that snake," said Nelly, who was following Zheng closely.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Wheel Snake." Zheng gave a nod of approval. That was what the members of the Eagle race called this snake.</p>

  <p>The tribal leaders and other members of the Eagle race simultaneously jumped off the backs of their respective eagles, and then carried the children with them.</p>

  <p>These children had been crying for their mothers throughout the journey.</p>

  <p>But they had fallen asleep since all the crying made them tired. Serenity could be seen in their childish faces. They were unaware of what they were about to face.</p>

  <p>Looking at the innocent face of the boy who was sleeping in her arms, Nelly felt pity for him and whispered, "Can't we do anything to save these children?"</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see," Zheng replied faintly.</p>

  <p>He was not sure of how ferocious the Heavenly Wheel Snake was.</p>

  <p>If the beast in the jade seal was as powerful as the Time Elk, even the consummate True Gods wouldn't be able to save the children, let alone him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the sky was filled with sounds of birds chirping.</p>

  <p>Then, several colorful clouds were visible floating in the sky. Those colorful clouds were made up of palm-sized colorful birds. Some people were standing on top of those birds.</p>

  <p>"The Swallow race is here," the chief said.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng also noticed three consummate True Gods standing on top of the clouds.</p>
