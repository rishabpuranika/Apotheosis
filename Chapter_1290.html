  <p>
</p>

  <p>It couldn't be denied? the breadth of Luo Zheng's master's knowledge far exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>The book entitled "Myriad Manifestations of Nature" was a record of some of the universe's extremely powerful and unique items, including the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Not only was its refining method recorded in the book, but a number of other aspects went above and beyond Luo Zheng's imagination. But because the materials for refining the mountain were rare, Luo Luo Zheng had yet to find them.</p>

  <p>Although the origin of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain wasn't wholly clear, it indeed existed in the great world. At the very least, it was not owned by anyone.</p>

  <p>If only the Soul Sea Realm masters of the four divine kingdoms could move the mountain, the mountain would have already settled on the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>But even while Luo Luo Zheng finally had the method of collecting the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, there were still a number of hurdles to overcome.</p>

  <p>A violent storm had been hanging above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars since many years ago? its wind blades were a great threat to even the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors. Although Luo Luo Zheng had already consecutively advanced two grades and currently stood at the third grade of the Life and Death Realm, it was too unrealistic for him to attempt to block the wind blades with the strength he had.</p>

  <p>An important point to note was that the most crucial part about collecting the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was stripping off the bottom of the mountain. It was such a sturdy structure that not even dozens of Soul Sea Realm masters could destroy it? Luo Luo Zheng couldn't even dream of doing so.</p>

  <p>After a moment of pondering, Luo Luo Zheng came up with a plan.</p>

  <p>At this time, the World Commercial Alliance suddenly released a message requesting all kinds of rare materials. Although these materials more or less appeared in the Central Region, they were extremely difficult to obtain.</p>

  <p>But brave men after great rewards never ran out. After all, how many people in the world could truly resist such temptations?</p>

  <p>Some of the materials had been kept in certain clans for generations.</p>

  <p>Now that they were sold at such a high price, they were all willing to sell them to the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>All the materials collected were piecemeal before being sent to the Cloud Hall one after another. Because of the great purchase momentum, it caught the attention of many other sects. After some investigation, it was revealed that the World Commercial Alliance was only helping the Cloud Hall, or perhaps, to speak frankly, it was helping Luo Luo Zheng take them all.</p>

  <p>But why was Luo Luo Zheng in need of such uncommon things? What could his purpose have been?</p>

  <p>It was rumored that he wanted to help the Cloud Hall build a super sect-protecting array, along with the rumor that he was preparing to make a breakthrough to the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>But these rumors were hardly convincing. The Cloud Hall already had a sect-protecting array, and Luo Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie were top figures in the Central Region? the Cloud Hall had no need for another sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>Even more ridiculous was the rumor that Luo Luo Zheng was about to make a breakthrough to the Soul Sea Realm? he was only at the third grade of the Life and Death Realm, after all.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was making divine textures, indeed. According to the records in the Myriad Manifestations of Nature, the process of collecting the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was divided into three steps? first, the mountain had to be compressed in a small space; second, the power of the five elements had to be used to suppress the entire structure; and third, the mountain would be collected.</p>

  <p>Already, Luo Luo Zheng was making his preparations.</p>

  <p>With that, his time seemed to grow shorter once again. In the day, he prepared the materials and made the divine textures. At night, he immersed himself in cultivating. In the next three months that passed, Luo Luo Zheng had no moment to spare.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure appeared above the sea, south of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie and Mu Ning were insistent of going on the quest with him, Luo Luo Zheng refused.</p>

  <p>While Yudie's strength had improved remarkably, she was still not strong enough to deal with the wind blades. Some of them contained the fifth layer of Wind Law? even though Luo Zheng's body was tough as a sacred weapon, he would be torn to pieces if he didn't know how to redirect the attacks.</p>

  <p>After possessing the will of the great world, Luo Luo Zheng tried to digest the memories in his head, uncovering numerous secrets.</p>

  <p>In the northern part of the Divine Kingdom Continent, for instance, lay a savage land and some extremely powerful vicious beasts? there were even a number of extremely powerful races among them. But the culture was utterly backward, and countless times more chaotic than the Sea God continent.</p>

  <p>Also, in a corner of the great world, a glorious civilization was settled? one that was destroyed 500, 000 years prior because of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Under the conflict of those warriors from the Upper World, that continent sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>But no matter how far Luo Luo Zheng searched, he couldn't find any memories of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. It seemed that the will of the great world had no knowledge of the storm, its origins, or what lay in the center of it. It was a strange ordeal, indeed.</p>

  <p>Moreover, behind the area was a group of Shadow Creatures whose strength was feared even by the mighty warriors of the Celestial Position race. Why would they be wandering behind the great world? Were they planning to do something to it? It couldn't be helped? the great world still had many unsolved mysteries.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Luo Zheng didn't have the means to unravel such mysteries? only collecting the Magnetic Sacred Mountain occupied his thoughts.</p>

  <p>But while it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to strip away the bottom of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain with his own strength, the power of the storm could be used instead.</p>

  <p>The second he entered the range of the storm above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, raging winds swept over him.</p>

  <p>The ocean seemed to be sucked into the sky by the violent storm, entwining like water dragons, forming a bridge between the sea and sky? it was quite the spectacle.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure rapidly shuttled back and forth between the dancing water and by then, quite a few wind blades were already sweeping toward him in the storm's periphery.</p>

  <p>The blades were a light-cyan color, with only level one of Wind Law, some holding level two. These didn't pose much of a threat to Luo Luo Zheng? he didn't even need to dodge when the wind blades hit him directly.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't manage to transfer the attacks, the wind blades were of no harm to him.</p>

  <p>As he endured the storm, his speed increased considerably as he flew forward.</p>

  <p>But he wasn't headed for the Magnetic Sacred Mountain? through the memories of the world's will, Luo Luo Zheng had already ascertained that the mountain was to the west of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. Instead of flying to the west, he flew south, going straight into the heart of the storm.</p>

  <p>Of course, he wasn't planning on merely exploring the heart of the storm out of curiosity? it was a necessary step for what he intended to do. If there was some powerful creature in the center of it, he would be doomed.</p>

  <p>While it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to strip away the bottom of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain with his own strength, the power of the storm could be used instead.</p>

  <p>The wind blades were indeed ridiculously powerful? Luo Luo Zheng was positive that transferring this power to the mountain could do the trick.</p>

  <p>One wind blade was probably not enough, but a hundred thousand, or maybe a million wind blades could work. Taking advantage of the wind blades, Luo Luo Zheng believed the Magnetic Sacred Mountain could be removed from its base.</p>

  <p>A concrete method had to be decided.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng advanced to the center of the storm, the wind blades turned sharper and sharper. Even wind blades containing the third or fourth layer of Wind Law began appearing around him, the colors fluctuating from light to dark shades of cyan.</p>

  <p>'It's not enough. These wind blades are enough to threaten me, but they can't shake the mountain, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, observing the blades sweeping around him. Even after he attempted to transfer the attacks to the bottom of the mountain, they had no trace of an effect on the mountain.</p>

  <p>'I have to find those black wind blades!' Fixing his gaze on the blades, Luo Luo Zheng continued to advance. After he had flown for about half a day, the first black wind blade finally appeared before him.</p>
