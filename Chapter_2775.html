<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before, Leland and the several top-rank True Gods watched in awe as the fight on the Desperation Plain raged on.</p>

  <p>He wasn't able to believe what he saw as Nicholas released a tremendous amount of power during the fight.</p>

  <p>Despite being a Demi-holy Being, Leland's combat abilities were definitely lower than those of the consummate True Gods who were engaged in the fight.</p>

  <p>He was acutely aware of this difference between their abilities; he had hoped that he wouldn't cross with any of them. After all, he just followed Zheng to come here.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, only one Demi-holy Being of the alliance of the powerful clans came over to check them out and asked a few questions. As quickly as they came, they left immediately, as if Leland and the top-rank True Gods with him were of no significance.</p>

  <p>After the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had left, Leland's group breathed a collective sigh of relief. But that didn't change the fact that they still had to find a way out of this place.</p>

  <p>The strange fish had told them that the space door was connected to a space channel that led to the fifth stage. This path was the only way for them to leave this place.</p>

  <p>Just as they were feeling hopeless, the space door began to tremble. Strong waves of Space Law rapidly radiated through the door, and a deep gash formed the space channel that appeared within the door frame.</p>

  <p>Leland and the three top-rank True Gods were exhilarated when they saw the scene unfolding before them.</p>

  <p>Overcome with excitement, the strange fish rushed headlong into the space door without a second thought.</p>

  <p>But immediately after it entered the space channel and supposedly disappeared in front of everyone's gaze, the strange fish came rushing back.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" asked Leland, his eyes wide in fear.</p>

  <p>The strange fish had no time to answer. Countless fierce beasts came out from the space channel.</p>

  <p>Leland's brows creased in a frown. He grabbed the strange fish and retreated to the side of the space door together with the other top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>"These beasts have been transported from the upper stages of the Abyss Demon Region..." Leland's expression was grave as he said his observation.</p>

  <p>He had already been to the Abyss Demon Region in the past, and it was easy for him to identify the origins of several fierce beasts.</p>

  <p>Luckily, as if they were enchanted by something, these beasts went straight to the Desperation Plain. It seemed like they chased after the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands; they totally ignored Leland's group and didn't attack them.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Are the fiends planning to use these beasts to deal with the Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>"It's useless even if they have large numbers. The outcome is not always decided by who has more troops..."</p>

  <p>While the several top-rank True Gods discussed the situation among themselves, one of them excitedly exclaimed, "No matter what, these fierce beasts have all reached the sixth stage. Doesn't it mean that the upper stages are empty?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! You're right! It would no longer be dangerous when we pass through the upper stages later," another top-rank True God affirmed.</p>

  <p>Leland acknowledged them with a nod. But his mind was still reeling from what happened in front of them, so he asked the strange fish beside him,</p>

  <p>"Do you know what happened?"</p>

  <p>The strange fish had been motionless and stunned ever since it came back from the space channel. After Leland asked the question, it suddenly cried out in a strange way. Its eyes had glazed over, then it unexpectedly stepped forward and joined the army of beasts without looking back.</p>

  <p>Leland's face darkened, as did his mood. He was soon lost in thought.</p>

  <p>He knew that the strange fish was desperate to leave this place...</p>

  <p>From what they had witnessed, it looked like all of the fierce beasts in the Abyss Demon Region had been under the control of someone...</p>

  <p>The Flame War Horses coming from both sides of the mountains were not a threat to the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>A Holy Being from the Fang Clan blew a small puff of air. A layer of frost first settled over the summits of the mountain range that stretched for dozens of miles, then the entire mountain range became covered in white.</p>

  <p>As for the Flame War Horses, the flames on their backs had been extinguished instantly, at the same moment that their bodies had been frozen where they stood.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of Flame War horses had been frozen on the mountainside while they were in mid-gallop.</p>

  <p>But behind the group of Flame War Horses were a group of Ghost Dogs that were barking wildly.</p>

  <p>"Behind us! There are also beasts!"</p>

  <p>"There are so many of them! Can it be possible that all the fierce beasts of the entire Abyss Demon Region have gathered here?"</p>

  <p>"It's highly probable. Take a look at the Ghost-faced Scorpions. They are ferocious beasts found on the second stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>But they actually appeared here!"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods had also been dumbfounded when they saw the scenario in front of them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, these beasts were easy to deal with. Even if they had a large number, they posed no threat to the warriors from the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. They would only end up slaughtered in massacre.</p>

  <p>At that point, anyone would have realized that these beasts were no more than war fodder.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>It had only taken three to five Demi-holy Beings to kill all manner of fierce beasts that rushed at them from all directions; the beasts hadn't been able to even come near them.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the group maintained a steady pace as they advanced forward while killing the fierce beasts...</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region, there was a huge altar where blood gushed like water splashing out from a fountain...</p>

  <p>Crimson light beamed from the skeletons that surrounded the altar from all sides.</p>

  <p>As the blood congealed constantly, it turned into a huge figure. It was a fiend that had just died.</p>

  <p>The altar was not only the place for the little fiends to be reincarnated, the other dead fiends could also be reincarnated here!</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>Wordlessly, the fiend launched himself off the altar.</p>

  <p>As soon as the previous fiend left the altar, another mass of congealed blood formed itself into a figure...</p>

  <p>All those fiends that had died on the Desperation Plain were brought back to life one by one.</p>

  <p>Fiends who had fought on the Desperation Plain had greatly varied strength levels. The strength of ordinary fiends was inferior to that of the fiend commanders, and the strength of the fiend commanders was much weaker than that of Gallio.</p>

  <p>If a fiend died once, all the accumulated Faith Energy in their bodies was used up, and they started all over again at the same level.</p>

  <p>For example, fiend commanders who were already up to one or two thousand feet in height returned to a height of a hundred feet. Their strength returned to the level of an ordinary fiend after they had lost the Faith Energy; their power was greatly decreased compared to the level they had before they died.</p>

  <p>"Bang Bang Bang..."</p>

  <p>Fiends were continuously revived on the altar and they slowly made their way down, one by one.</p>

  <p>The last mass of congealed blood kept scintillating, until it finally formed into a fiend that was over a hundred feet high again.</p>

  <p>This figure became the center of attention; all fiends stared at it with a strange expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>It was Gallio.</p>

  <p>The longer a fiend stayed in the Abyss Demon Region and absorbed the Faith Energy, the more their power grew.</p>

  <p>Gallio was considered to be one of the powerful fiends because he had the ability to absorb other people's Faith Energy, while his could not be absorbed by others!</p>

  <p>Aside from Gallio, there were three other powerful fiends who had become progressively stronger over the years. The level of their strength was way beyond that of ordinary fiends, so they naturally became leaders.</p>

  <p>But today, Gallio was actually killed...</p>

  <p>The fiends whispered among each other.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Gallio looked down upon the other lesser fiends and swept his gaze over the crowd. He spoke in an indifferent voice, "You wait here!"</p>

  <p>The current Gallio was not the powerful Gallio that he used to be. His strength was no different from that of ordinary fiends!</p>

  <p>But he still held a position of authority in the hearts of the fiends. All of the other fiends shut their mouths immediately.</p>

  <p>Gallio descended the altar slowly and headed straight towards the Fiend Hall in the distance.</p>
