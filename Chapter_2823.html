<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2823 Dark Light Word Transformation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Rising up in the sky, Luo Zheng paced in the air in this void.</p>

  <p>But every time he started to attack, he stopped after finishing only half of it.</p>

  <p>Having fought with Nicholas for ten times in the future, Luo Zheng had also stopped an attack ten times in a row by now. Each time he kept seeing the scene of his future failure.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams condensed by Nicholas was like an indestructible millstone.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Zheng's physical body had improved greatly and he could even travel through the Sea of Truth. However, it was still impossible for him to withstand the Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>After thirteen attempts, Nicholas closed his eyes, making the light in them fade away.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Luo Zheng could see through his memory, he no longer tried to see the scenes in the future.</p>

  <p>Smiling faintly, Nicholas said, "Time is a very interesting thing. If I don't let you take a peek into the future, that makes it indefinite. You can attack me now."</p>

  <p>The scene appearing in Nicholas' visions would surely happen. In other words, once Luo Zheng took action, he would definitely lose the fight.</p>

  <p>But if he stopped looking into the future, the future would be unpredictable.</p>

  <p>Even though Nicholas said so, Luo Zheng still didn't make a move. As he stood there and stared at Nicholas, a hint of hesitation reflected in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You dare not?" Nicholas teased with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>He then raised his arm gently.</p>

  <p>Truth of Dark and Light Chaos slowly flowed out from his hand.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Constantly gathering above Nicholas, the black aura flowed clockwise, while the white one slowly flowed the other way. Since Luo Zheng refused to attack, Nicholas would make his move first.</p>

  <p>In reality, Nicholas was only afraid of the True Demon Body, together with its demonic red lotuses and cold ice flowers.</p>

  <p>He knew that the two forms of the True Demon Body were connected to each other, thus, their energy could be mutually transformed and never be exhausted. This made it invincible.</p>

  <p>However, after the connection between the two had been cut off by Samuel, Nicholas was given a chance to display his power. Moreover, the other form of True Demon Body was now in Lowell's hands.</p>

  <p>As the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos continuously flowed, the Eight Diagrams floated over Nicholas' head. It became larger and emitted an indescribable aura.</p>

  <p>The moment everyone felt that aura, Samuel, the woman, Sword Chen, and the remaining Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods finally realized Nicholas' real strength.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Raising his head, Nicholas looked at Luo Zheng. He stretched out his hand, slightly bending his middle finger, as if he was picking up the stars from the sky.</p>

  <p>Even though his movements were gentle and slow, his intention to kill was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As soon as his finger moved, the Eight Diagrams above his head suddenly shook, releasing a strange force across the void to directly attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?!"</p>

  <p>Like a mountain that collapsed, Luo Zheng's huge body suddenly trembled.</p>

  <p>In astonishment, he retreated at a crazy speed.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Though he was able to retreat in time, it was not enough for Luo Zheng to avoid the attack. A dent marked his chest with a fingerprint that was several hundred feet wide and three thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>Despite having a huge and extremely tough body, he still suffered the attack.</p>

  <p>If it had been any other Holy Beings, Nicholas would have smashed them into pieces and turned their souls into dust.</p>

  <p>After forcing Luo Zheng to retreat, Nicholas decided to not chase him down.</p>

  <p>Smiling faintly, his gaze roamed around and fell onto Samuel, who was standing from a distance. "Do you think you can control everything as long as you can read my memory?"</p>

  <p>Samuel's face slightly hardened upon hearing Nicholas' question. Holding the Spear of Supreme Harmony tightly, he answered coldly, "So what? I may not be your opponent outside, but see, what can you do to me here?"</p>

  <p>He was able to travel through the space freely, so no matter how powerful Nicholas was, he could do nothing to him.</p>

  <p>"I let you do what you wanted because I wanted to use you to break the connection between the two forms of the True Demon Body," Nicholas announced, and his aura continued to increase. "In fact, if you have submitted to me in your previous life, you would have become my right-hand man by now. Unfortunately, you've chosen a wrong path, and going further along this path will always result to a failure."</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As soon as Nicholas finished talking, the huge Eight Diagrams increased tenfold again.</p>

  <p>It continued to swell at an incredible speed. At this rate, it would fully occupy the entire void soon.</p>

  <p>As Nicholas' powerful aura dawned on them, everyone suddenly felt they were becoming extremely insignificant.</p>

  <p>"The world of chaos is formless! Billions of mysteries are born in chaos.</p>

  <p>They can turn into Dark and Light energies as well as time."</p>

  <p>Nicholas, who was floating in the void at this time, seemed to have changed into another person. The aura that he was emitting was unpredictable, as if everything in the world had existed because of him!</p>

  <p>"Is this the strength of Other Shore Realm?" Retreating at a distance, Luo Zheng looked at this scene in surprise.</p>

  <p>Stunned, Samuel asked, "You've stepped into the Other Shore Realm?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas completely ignored Samuel's query. Looking up at the huge Eight Diagrams covering the entire void, he muttered, "I've been floating on the Sea of Truth in the past few years, and I've met countless extraordinary people on the sea. I have met the Half Page Book's descendant, the Magic Door Tower's elite disciples and many other talents... Even the few with the worst talent have already crossed the ninth section of the Sea of Truth and stepped onto the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>I, Nicholas, is the most talented warrior in the divine land. I'm still unable to cross the last threshold and reach the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But I made a good friend on the Sea of Truth and he helped me a lot. After the Dark Light World Transformation has been passed to me, it enabled me to transform any world and make it for my own use."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, it was not easy to cross the Sea of Truth, even for the geniuses in the Source World.</p>

  <p>For example, Luo Zheng met several inner disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but they were still stuck in the first section of the Sea of Truth, and even Luo Zheng had not really passed that part.</p>

  <p>The further it went, the more challenging the journey was. There were some people whose Truth Boats were destroyed in the Sea of Truth and their Souls of light were shattered.</p>

  <p>The ninth section of the Sea of Truth was the most difficult, which was why more than ninety percent of True Gods were stuck near the ninth section.</p>

  <p>People who had reached the ninth section of the Sea of Truth were considered to be half step into the Other Shore Realm. However, there was a world of difference between them and the real masters at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>As a rare genius in the divine land, Nicholas grabbed the opportunity to make friends with talents in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Dark Light World Transformation technique had been passed down to him from a friend.</p>

  <p>However, using this method might also cause him a great harm. It would even affect his Truth Boat and delay him in crossing the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't been forced to the corner, Nicholas wouldn't have used it.</p>
