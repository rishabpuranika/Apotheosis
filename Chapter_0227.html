<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 227 Interesting Boy (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"As I expected, you plan to attack me from the front this time!" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly dashed forward, and the broken flying blade hit the person on his front for the third time. When it hit Yves, Luo Luo Zheng made a circular motion with his finger, and a dark purple demonic life energy surged in the air.</p>

  <p>The dark purple demonic life energy was obscure and had a similar color to the black fog conjured by Yves. Unless one really looked at it, one would miss it.</p>

  <p>The demonic life energy unfurled in the winds, unleashing itself from its constraints like sweeping riffles in a river.</p>

  <p>When the energy touched the black fog, Luo Luo Zheng smacked his head lightly as if rebuking himself. He shouted, "Alas, I guessed wrong. It isn't in the front. It must be... at the back!"</p>

  <p>Poof!</p>

  <p>Energy escaped from the Phoenix Crystal on Luo Zheng's right arm and his speed increased to a realm of horror. In the blink of an eye, he had cut the figure behind him more than thirty times.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slashed the blade too quickly, so he didn't hear Yves's screeches until he pulled back.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wielded the blade again but didn't kill Yves. He slashed thirty times within moments and chopped off Yves's arms and legs.</p>

  <p>He could have cut Yves into pieces by hacking him with his broken flying blade, but he didn't go that far.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng swept the black fog aside and trotted to Yves. Looking at the effeminate man, he asked coldly, "Do you still want to know my name?"</p>

  <p>"How did you find me?" Yves screamed.</p>

  <p>"Are you very curious?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>Yves's face was contorted in severe pain. "Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Go to the hell if you wish to find the answer!" After Luo Luo Zheng spoke, the broken flying blade in his hand hurled into the air to stab Yves in the neck before shooting to the ground. Luo Luo Zheng snapped his thumb and the blade flew back to him.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Luo Luo Zheng had been misled.</p>

  <p>Man's life vitality was wonderful and varied.</p>

  <p>Yves's fighting ways had truly astonished him.</p>

  <p>In truth, from the beginning to the end, Yves had been fighting against Luo Luo Zheng alone. It was not the black fog that was a creation of his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The black fog before Luo Zheng's eyes was nothing but a deceptive trick meaning to fool him. It must have been made to morph out of something else. Yves's own life vitality turned... into himself.</p>

  <p>A human's life vitality could turn into lotuses, as was the case with Vale.</p>

  <p>Somebody else could morph it into an enchanted barrier, as Yolande did.</p>

  <p>But Yves' life vitality had transformed into himself!</p>

  <p>The person Luo Luo Zheng had stabbed in the beginning was an illusion made out of Yves's life vitality.</p>

  <p>When Yves attacked the first time, he turned his own life vitality into two false dummies.</p>

  <p>He followed this plan of attack with Luo Luo Zheng at the second time, and when he hurled it for the third time, Luo Luo Zheng saw right through it and realized a solution.</p>

  <p>While Yves fabricated an illusion of three fake opponents to attack him, Luo Luo Zheng unfurled the demonic life energy in his body. It could devour another's life vitality. Luo Luo Zheng figured that the counterfeit Yves in his front, on his left and on his right would be swallowed by his own demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>The three of them were illusions created with Yves's life vitality, while the real Yves attacked him from behind.</p>

  <p>After perceiving thus, Luo Luo Zheng had decisively launched the attack at his back.</p>

  <p>The black fog disappeared slowly after he killed Yves. dozens of people from the seven noble clans had watched Yves attack Luo Luo Zheng before the fog enveloped the two of them, assuming that it would be an easy kill.</p>

  <p>According to them, Yves was more than capable to take on the young man who had suddenly broken in like a moth flying into a spider web mistakenly. Yves only had to reach out and pick him from the web before squeezing him to death.</p>

  <p>As the black fog ebbed away to reveal Luo Luo Zheng, one of the members of the noble clans glanced at the scene casually before gasping in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well? Yves is dead?"</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman also turned to stare at Luo Luo Zheng, her brows wrinkled and lips twisted. "Quite interesting. He managed to kill Yves. It appears I've underestimated him."</p>

  <p>"He's only half a step into the nature level. With that level of strength, he could take Yves's life? Interesting boy!" someone else said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't approach them after making the kill, instead, he turned to make a detour from the side.</p>

  <p>However, at the same moment, the long-haired woman spoke out loud in a firm voice. "Who on earth are you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at her, beady-eyed. "Who am I? That's got nothing to do with you. Don't bother frightening me with your names and titles. It's of no use. I want nothing to do with the noble clans. We go our own way without interfering with each other."</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman hollered with laughter at his words. "How naive of you to say that!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng swept the flying blade horizontally across his chest. "I don't know if I am naive, but anyone who dares to cross me will die, just like this one lying on the ground!" He motioned at Yves with his foot.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have no scruple about the seven noble clans. They looked on in shock. Several of them emanated dangerous energies about them. If they really wanted to fight Luo Luo Zheng, he would have no choice but to flee for his life.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had seen what was in the Weapon Refining Principle, and he was not a fool. There was a great chance for the impossible to occur in this world, as well as in this Immortal Mansion. He had no reason to shrink back.</p>

  <p>"Ha-haha!"</p>

  <p>"Ha ha..."</p>

  <p>The members of the top seven noble clans stared at him and burst into raucous laughter, as if Luo Luo Zheng had just made a joke.</p>
