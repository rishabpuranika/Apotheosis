  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rushed through the narrow door and fell straight down.</p>

  <p>His gaze was fixed on the leaf. The big bug was eating the ore in the leaf.</p>

  <p>One thousand feet, five hundred feet, one hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Power had already begun to accumulate in Luo Zheng's fists.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng attacked. He was desperate for the life stones. Even if there was only one life stone in the bug's body, he would kill for it.</p>

  <p>The strike contained the impact of the fall. Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng also activated the power of five hundred dragon scales.</p>

  <p>He went straight for the bug's back. However, as he approached it, the bug seemed to have a premonition. It stomped its two hind legs and evaded the punch by flipping to one side.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's fist slammed forcefully onto the leaf. The giant leaf, along with the stem began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The bug who was now twenty feet away from Luo Luo Zheng, waved its sharp forelegs, provoking him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the leaf beneath his feet. His punch had already made quite a few cracks on it. He swept his gaze over it but could not find the life stone.</p>

  <p>His body was as hard as a sacred weapon and possessed terrifying strength. He could break the leaves on the 30th layer without using a pickax. Of course, it would be easier using one.</p>

  <p>"You want to provoke me?"</p>

  <p>Light flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes as a look of determination came on his face.</p>

  <p>He bent his legs slightly.</p>

  <p>Although the huge bug was quick and nimble, Luo Luo Zheng was confident of catching it.</p>

  <p>The bug was still waving its forelegs and squeaking, almost mocking him. Suddenly Luo Luo Zheng leaped, covering the distance between them in a flash, his outstretched arms ready to grab the bug!</p>

  <p>The huge bug was even more agile than Life and Death Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Its perception of danger seemed to come entirely from its instinct. Even though Luo Luo Zheng had deployed a strategy to attack it, the bug still sensed danger through its incredibly strong sense of smell. Before Luo Luo Zheng could launch another attack, it spread its wings, preparing to leave the leaf and flee.</p>

  <p>"You're going nowhere!" Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>In that split-second, the forceful energy within his body erupted, and his body was propelled forward two feet!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body left the leaf. At the same time, the invisible falling force began to pull at his body. But the moment Luo Luo Zheng was pulled down by that huge force, his hand had already grabbed one of the big bug's hind legs.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The large bug was persistently trying to kick Luo Luo Zheng off. But his grip was strong. The big bug would not be able to escape his hold.</p>

  <p>This big bug wasn't affected by the gravitational pull and could freely fly among the leaves. But, the gravitational force was pulling Luo Luo Zheng down, who was holding onto the bug's leg, and, in turn, dragging it down a little too.</p>

  <p>The large bug flapped its wings desperately to prevent itself from being pulled down with Luo Luo Zheng, but the irresistible gravitational force finally managed to drag it down along with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>Driven by instinct, the bug continued to fly at full speed, causing both of them to spin while rapidly dropping altitude.</p>

  <p>Lord Randy was still on a leaf of the 27th layer, painstakingly excavating the ores. There was a priceless mist stone buried underneath the leaf. The Lord had resolved to get it no matter what. When he swung his pickax again, he suddenly saw a shadow pass over him and then it circled him once. He was alarmed.</p>

  <p>The rules in this space were extremely strict. A Soul Sea Realm warrior couldn't fly or resist the falling force. However, Lord Randy had clearly seen a figure fly above him just now.</p>

  <p>So he hurriedly walked to the edge of the leaf and checked out the surroundings. Then his face was full of astonishment, "Th-Tianxing..."</p>

  <p>He saw Luo Luo Zheng hanging onto a large, emerald green bug and circling the tree.</p>

  <p>"What...what's going on?" Lord Randy asked, feeling a little dizzy at the sight.</p>

  <p>At least two-thirds of the warriors were painstakingly digging for ore in the leaves of the tree. Most of the divine-level talents were witnessing this strange scene.</p>

  <p>"It looks like Tianxing. Why is he hanging off a...a mineral-devouring bug?"</p>

  <p>"Um...it's unbelievable! How did he catch a mineral-devouring bug?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I can remember, only Soul Sea Realm warriors have ever been able to catch these bugs."</p>

  <p>As the crowd watched, Luo Zheng's figure rapidly descended until he reached the bottom of the tree and disappeared into the light circle.</p>

  <p>Soon, he, dragging the bug, appeared on one side of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>Camilla was happily bargaining with the martial artist in front of her. She believed he had at least ten life stones. She knew that Luo Luo Zheng valued life stones, so she was determined to get all of them from the martial artist even if she ended up losing some money in this deal.</p>

  <p>She suddenly heard a violent noise followed by the sharp, urgent sound of an insect.</p>

  <p>She turned her head to look, and her eyes widened in shock when she saw the insect. "Th-Tianxing... That...that's a mineral-devouring bug!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>It also drew the attention of the warriors, who were trading ores outside the pyramid.</p>

  <p>After passing through space, Luo Luo Zheng was no longer affected by the strong gravitational force. The large bug spread its wings and flew higher into the sky, pulling him up with it.</p>

  <p>No way was Luo Luo Zheng going to let this darn bug succeed!</p>

  <p>He took a deep breath and started wriggling upwards and climbed onto the back of the huge bug.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The large bug was quick to react, even quicker than most Life and Death Realm experts. It twisted its two forelegs and tried to stab Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"In your dreams!" Luo Luo Zheng jeered.</p>

  <p>He swayed and dodged the attack. Using his hand as a blade he slashed the back of the large bug.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had managed to tear off the shell on the back of the large bug. As a result, its wings broke and it plummeted downwards.</p>

  <p>Slam!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned his body slightly and bent his left leg. He pressed his knee down on the head of the big bug. The moment the big bug fell to the ground, Luo Luo Zheng crushed its head. Its vitality was also very tenacious. Even without its head, it continued to swing its six feet, struggling for a long time before its legs slowly stiffened, and its life gradually ended.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng dusted off his clothes and jumped off the dead bug. Camilla rushed to him. She had been in such a hurry she didn't even have the time to transfer the pile of ores on the ground into her space ring; instead, she just wrapped the ores haphazardly in her clothes. "Tianxing, how, how did you catch a mineral-devouring bug?" she asked wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Oh. Is that a mineral-devouring bug?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>By now Lord Randy had also hurried over from the circle of light. He noticed that Luo Luo Zheng had already subdued the mineral-devouring bug. He was happy and surprised at the same time.</p>

  <p>Not just the Lord, but even the other practitioners in the mining tree had left the light circle and rushed over to Luo Luo Zheng to see what the hubbub was all about.</p>

  <p>When Lord Randy heard Luo Zheng's question, he laughed loudly and replied,</p>

  <p>"That's right, Tianxing. That is a mineral-devouring bug. It devours ores from the tree."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the divine-level talents, who were rushing over, with a strange expression on his face. 'Even though it is a mineral-devouring bug, it couldn't be valuable. It only has some ores in its stomach, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Before he could voice his thoughts, someone nearby said, "Luo Luo Zheng, I would advise you not to touch this mineral-devouring bug. Otherwise, you'll be dead for sure."</p>
