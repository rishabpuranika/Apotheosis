<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was truly a good thing that the Formless Sky Pythons lay motionless in deep slumber, like they were dead meat.</p>

  <p>Silence hung thick in the air as Kaydan's mouth moved and a strand of light blue life vitality spread out. "Everyone, try your best to not make any sound and follow me," he said.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was known to be a chaotic place since it did not have a strict structure. It was the definition of anarchy.</p>

  <p>Even then, the interior world was even more chaotic.</p>

  <p>This particular batch of Formless Sky Pythons had never left the interior world. When these warriors entered it last time, however, they stayed in the depths of one of the interior world's mountain ranges instead of sleeping here.</p>

  <p>Kaydan and the others were shocked the first time they saw those Formless Sky Pythons. Fortunately, the huge Pythons were fast asleep� so as long as everyone was careful, the Formless Sky Pythons would remain in slumber.</p>

  <p>Although such was the case, the fact that there were also so many other monsters pressured all of them.</p>

  <p>Thus, everyone tried their hardest to move slowly and quietly.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the warriors at present had long since mastered the control of their own bodies. The area was dipped in absolute silence, and not even the slightest sounds of footsteps were heard.</p>

  <p>But of course, they couldn't move fast enough while they maintained such a stealthy posture. It took them a while before they reached ten miles.</p>

  <p>At that moment, no one still dared to speed up. After all, ten miles was equivalent to just a single step for the Formless Sky Pythons, and any noise they would've made could cost them their lives.</p>

  <p>At the same time, all of them felt slightly relieved. The further away they were from the beasts, the safer they would be.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, all of them felt the ground shake.</p>

  <p>The tremors in the ground were accompanied by a rumbling sound. All the colors in their faces were drained as they turned their heads to look back...</p>

  <p>Among the hundreds of slumbering Pythons were two already awake Formless Sky Pythons, which slowly rose up from their sleep. Their cylindrical heads were currently looking at the warriors.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng also turned around to look and suddenly frowned. Then, his gaze immediately landed on Han Liusu...</p>

  <p>The two of them seemed to have realized something the moment they looked at each other. At the same time, Kennan, Chapman and the rest also understood.</p>

  <p>It looked like Han Liusu seemed to attract the strange beasts!</p>

  <p>However, no one knew why it was the case.</p>

  <p>The reason Luo Zheng had been chased by a Formless Sky Python when he had first arrived at the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was because Han Liusu had attracted it.</p>

  <p>Later on, she had even attracted the Martial Sacred Beast, which chased after her as well.</p>

  <p>Chapman had known about it, but failed to realize it sooner. After all, the fact that Han Liusu could attract the Martial Sacred Beast did not mean that she could attract all the beasts.</p>

  <p>Yet, it was safe to say that right now, Han Liusu most likely caused the sudden awakening of the Formless Sky Pythons.</p>

  <p>Then again, now wasn't the time to think about why!</p>

  <p>"Rumble!"</p>

  <p>The two Formless Sky Pythons straightened up, which made them look like a small mountain range. They blocked the light source above the cave and formed a huge wall that surrounded all the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Go! Just ignore it!"</p>

  <p>Kaydan didn't understand why these two beasts still woke up despite the fact that they moved so carefully and managed to stay perfectly silent.</p>

  <p>The last time they passed by these Formless Sky Pythons, someone had accidentally knocked over a huge rock, which fell on one of the huge beasts. However, they did not wake up at all.</p>

  <p>Today, this group of warriors had performed even better. Only the woman of the Han Clan had casually said a few words but other than that, they did not make even the slightest sound after. How did they awaken the Formless Sky Pythons then?</p>

  <p>But it was clear that Kaydan couldn't investigate what really happened at the moment. He waved his hand and led the Skyland warriors to fly forward.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the warriors from the Collapsing Mountain race, the Harmony race, the divine land and the other races ran behind the Skyland warriors like mad.</p>

  <p>Just then, one of the Formless Sky Pythons had already opened its huge mouth and pounced towards them.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The ground continued to shake with the heavy impact and at that moment, the Collapsing Mountain warriors got caught in the midst of the chase!</p>

  <p>The huge snake-like beast fell over, and then the mountains and the earth shook violently with a heavy thud.</p>

  <p>While the Formless Sky Python was a terrifying creature, it oddly wasn't able to do anything to the Collapsing Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>There were a few muffled sounds, before the massive Formless Sky Python suddenly fell to the side in front of everyone. Then, several members of the Collapsing Mountain race's Divinity Hunt Squad finally took action.</p>

  <p>It could be said that while the Formless Sky Python was terrifying in terms of pure strength, the Collapsing Mountain warriors were even more powerful!</p>

  <p>If there had been only one or two Formless Sky Pythons in the place, the warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race would've attacked the beasts instead of escaping, and the ones that would be fleeing for their lives would be the Formless Sky Pythons.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, they were faced with over a hundred Formless Sky Pythons this time!</p>

  <p>All the chaos and violence caused more and more Formless Sky Pythons to wake up. The beasts discovered their targets and wasted no time in rushing towards the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh..."</p>

  <p>Everyone moved in their fastest speed that their bodies left lines behind in the nippy air.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors might be able to restrain one or two Formless Sky Pythons, but they could not defeat dozens of them. If the warriors were slow, they might even end up in the beasts' bellies.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The second Formless Sky Python suddenly twisted its body and launched itself forward once again with a loud crash.</p>

  <p>After about ten seconds, everyone had already travelled several dozen miles. However, the Formless Sky Python only moved slightly but it had crossed a distance of over a hundred miles. How could the warriors possibly escape from it?</p>

  <p>Hot air filled the area as the second Formless Sky Python opened its annular mouth, which looked like a huge crater.</p>

  <p>The third Formless Sky Python simply swept over from the side. The Formless Sky Pythons clearly wanted to fight for the most delicious food, which was their only goal� Han Liusu!</p>

  <p>More and more screams filled the air as the crowd continued to flee in panic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was already standing on the spot. If he couldn't escape, he could only calmly choose to counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't his turn to take action right now.</p>

  <p>"We fight with one heart!" Tilton, the leader of the Harmony race, suddenly shouted.</p>

  <p>The six elite warriors of the Harmony race standing beside Tilton shouted at the same time, "We fight with one heart!" They stretched out their hands and pressed them against their heads with their eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, rays of golden light flashed above their heads for a moment.</p>

  <p>The rays of golden light immediately spiraled outwards, connected with each other, and then encircled Tilton.</p>

  <p>"Disturb minds!"</p>

  <p>When that was done, Tilton pressed his hand on his head as well.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment when his body began to emit a unique energy.</p>

  <p>The formless energy was invisible and colorless, but everyone present felt it. After that, all of them became increasingly anxious to the point that they wanted to tear everything around them to shreds.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was no exception. He felt as if his mind was in a state of panic and at the same, he had unleashed a brutal Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Such a feeling was somewhat similar to when the malicious Mu Ning entered their bodies, but the two sensations were actually fundamentally different.</p>

  <p>While the malicious Mu Ning was only used to activate the warriors' ruthlessness and violence, this energy directly affected their minds and changed their original intentions.</p>

  <p>Now, this current energy that affected the soul and mind wasn't actually aimed at the warriors, but at the two Formless Sky Pythons. Yet, just a small trace of it was enough to make everyone panic.</p>

  <p>The moment the formless energy was poured into one of the Formless Sky Pythons, the huge beast suddenly let out a strange howl. Then, it quickly changed its direction at the last moment and headed towards the other Formless Sky Python instead! The other Formless Sky Python didn't want to be defeated, as it also raised its head and started to fight back. The ground shook even more than what was possible as the two beasts engaged in a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of the Harmony race don't seem strong, but they can directly control the Formless Sky Pythons' minds. They are indeed extremely powerful!" Luo Zheng exclaimed. Even he himself was surprised at the shocking turn of events.</p>

  <p>Such an advantageous attack enabled the warriors of the Harmony race to finally control the two Formless Sky Pythons that charged at the front.</p>

  <p>But their small victory did not last. Hundreds of Formless Sky Pythons behind them already rolled over. The onslaught of the multiple colossal monsters shook the ground even more violently, and the warriors felt like they were on the tidal waves which were constantly churning and rolling.</p>

  <p>The whole scene looked terrifying and impressive at the same time!</p>

  <p>All of them could only focus on one thing, and that was to rush forward.</p>

  <p>Kaydan of the Skyland race was the most familiar with the interior world, so everyone could only put their hopes on him and pray that he could lead them out of their current hellhole.</p>
