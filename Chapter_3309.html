<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was no time for Feng Ge to check the cave before jumping inside.</p>

  <p>But when she heard Zheng warn her from above, she resisted on instinct, releasing golden whips from her Soul of Light and lashing at the white shadow that appeared before her.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>When she used her divine flames of the Sun Crow race on the Other Shore, they were like a soul theurgy. The power of the flames imposed on physical bodies was rather ordinary, but if the opponent was in soul form, their power was not to be scoffed at.</p>

  <p>And the white shadow was in just soul form.</p>

  <p>As the divine flames almost hit the figure, Feng Ge felt a sudden strange force.</p>

  <p>The force sent her flying horizontally without warning? the golden whips deviated from the attack as she lost control.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>She hit the wall hard.</p>

  <p>Her Soul of Light was, of course, incomparable to Zheng's. After the collision, she passed out immediately.</p>

  <p>The force exerted on her wasn't dissipating? it kept her nailed firmly to the wall.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The white shadow didn't seem to have any intention of killing her, though.</p>

  <p>After knocking her unconscious, it flew in closer.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea what it was planning, but from its actions, he could vaguely guess what it was up to, so he didn't want it anywhere near Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The power of the Strength God Totem emanated from his body as he got ready to leap into the air.</p>

  <p>Over the past three days, he had replenished his power with a considerable amount of divine crystals. His two Other Shore Tokens were in their best state.</p>

  <p>But just as he was about to jump, he felt his feet sink into the ground.</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>Zheng felt his heart skip a beat as he carefully examined the situation? his eyes went wide.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the cave, the ground felt soft? he figured it was just the soil.</p>

  <p>But now that his feet were stuck, he realized that he was stepping on huge lumps of meat.</p>

  <p>In fact, the entire floor was covered by lumps of meat, with meridians separating the flesh and purple blood flowing rapidly through them.</p>

  <p>Although he had seen such passageway in the Grand Sky Temple, he knew he was in a far stranger place.</p>

  <p>His surprise lasted only a second.</p>

  <p>Seeing as the white figure was already right in front of Feng Ge, he had no time to lose.</p>

  <p>"Six hundred divine megatons of force?"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power of the Strength God Totem erupted and Zheng managed to pull his feet out from in between the flesh on the ground.</p>

  <p>He rushed to the side like a sling-shot stone and grabbed at the white shadow with his hands like a bolt of lightning.</p>

  <p>The figure saw Feng Ge as a lifesaver? it wanted to seize the opportunity to enter her Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Just then?</p>

  <p>Zheng felt the light above him start dimming again. dozens of great stones blocked the cave's entrance, enveloping them in darkness.</p>

  <p>Even light with strong penetrating power would take some time to get through the stones.</p>

  <p>The tentacles slithered along the cave walls and flocked into the dark cave.</p>

  <p>When one of Zheng's hands was about to grab the white shadow, the tentacles shot out and wrapped around Zheng's body. It was a horrible sight? dozens of thick tentacles entangling him and each other.</p>

  <p>As the tentacles restrained him completely, all he could do was watch as the shadow rushed into Feng Ge's Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Once the tentacles dragged Zheng out of the cave, another group made its way into it, aiming at Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>No foreign beings were allowed to exist in the holy tomb.</p>

  <p>But before they could reach her, they began trembling all of a sudden as though they had received some sort of irresistible signal. After another moment, they left Feng Ge behind and retreated.</p>

  <p>The other tentacles were still holding great stones up, blocking the light from outside.</p>

  <p>It was the first time the pig-faced monsters had even gotten close to the holy tomb. All were wearing faces of reverence at that moment.</p>

  <p>Hurriedly, they bowed before the tomb and restored it before heading out.</p>

  <p>Once again, the giant stones were penetrated by the light? it reached down, shining onto the tomb.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, save for the new soil on the tomb's surface, there were barely any traces of damage. After light broke through the stones, fragments fell and their debris turned to dust under the light before disappearing entirely.</p>

  <p>The tentacles kept pulling on Zheng until they held him midair? they seemed to be competing for him among themselves. Each of them wanted to pull him into their own caves and devour him slowly.</p>

  <p>Each tentacle released a great force during the fight? Zheng could feel his body being slowly, agonizingly torn apart.</p>

  <p>Still, his body was highly strong? if it were any other body, they'd already be in pieces.</p>

  <p>In the end, one of the tentacles won, and Zheng was dragged into a triangular cave.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred feet deep inside, he could smell the old, rotting blood on the walls. Clumps of fur and bones were scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>'These must be the corpses of the black monkeys from earlier?' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng could tell what they were from the dark fur? the three black monkeys that had been caught a while earlier. They were already eaten.</p>

  <p>But how did the tentacles cut through the monkeys' bones?</p>

  <p>No matter how strong they were, tentacles were soft in nature. At most, they could only tear the bodies into pieces like one would tear paper. But Zheng could see that the pieces of bone were cleanly cut and extremely smooth. Apparently, they were cut by some sharp weapons.</p>

  <p>While he pondered, two more tentacles extended from within the cave.</p>

  <p>They were slightly thinner than the others, but each had a row of sharp teeth on one side? Zheng's questions about the bones were answered.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The soft tentacles held Zheng's body in place as the other two rushed toward him.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>As the two tentacles moved backward and forward around Zheng's shoulders, their rows of teeth were like saws as they cut into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>As the cutting began, a burning pain shot through Zheng's arms and his shoulders were covered in blood. The tentacles' strength was beyond anything Zheng could have ever imagined.</p>

  <p>If the sawing went on, he'd be left in pieces soon. His brows furrowed tightly as he thought of his predicament.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>The tentacles continued the torturous motion.</p>

  <p>In the second round of cutting, they had reached his flesh and muscles? the white of his bones was already visible.</p>
