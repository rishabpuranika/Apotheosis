<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the fiend's arm, there was a skull that had obviously belonged to a True God.</p>

  <p>It wasn't known how it had been refined, but its surface was shining with a strange luster.</p>

  <p>Cluck, cluck, cluck?</p>

  <p>As the skull's lower jaw moved, the voice of the fiend came out through the skull's mouth.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region, there was a humongous pile of corpses.</p>

  <p>At the very top of the pile sat another fiend, devouring the corpses with his sharp teeth.</p>

  <p>These corpses actually didn't belong to any living beings. They were nothing but fantasies that were naturally produced in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Some of these corpse even had the ability to attack as a whole. They would squirm around, trying to swallow any creature that dared to approach them.</p>

  <p>This particular corpse pile had originally been 30, 000 feet high.</p>

  <p>However, the fiend, which was only two feet tall, like a dwarf, had devoured more than half of the pile in five minutes.</p>

  <p>The huge corpse pile kept wriggling as the corpses at the bottom stretched their limbs to carry the pile forward. However, the corpses at the top were not able to get rid of the fiend; countless corpses were letting out horrifying screams.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy. It's not easy to get to the top, you know. I haven't eaten such delicious corpses in a long time," said the fiend to the skull on his arm as he chewed. As he spoke, blood dribbled down his chin.</p>

  <p>"Yummy..." Then, after a while, the fiend said, "Wrath and Envy haven't come up yet. I'm afraid we can't do it alone."</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region, which was formed by all the negative Faith Energies, had once been an extremely chaotic world.</p>

  <p>It had been dominated by seven negative emotions of all the creatures in the divine land:</p>

  <p>Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Envy, and Wrath.</p>

  <p>All of the monsters in the Abyss Demon Region were under the control of these emotions. There was no trust and no rules, only the law of the jungle.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the rise of the fiends, the chaos might have lasted forever.</p>

  <p>However, the fiends had ended all of this.</p>

  <p>The fiends were a special race born in the Abyss Demon Region; they possessed unparalleled wisdom.</p>

  <p>Even so, in the beginning, they had also been affected by the seven negative emotions and had fought within themselves for years. They had attacked one another and suffered countless casualties.</p>

  <p>But eventually, a particularly clever fiend had found a method to control these seven negative emotions.</p>

  <p>Not only had he gained full control over the seven negative emotions, but he had also turned these emotions into seven fiends that served the fiend race.</p>

  <p>The fiend on the lava lake was named Pride.</p>

  <p>As for the fiend that was currently devouring the corpses, he was Gluttony. He had been eating continuously since the day he was born, but he had never been able to fill his stomach.</p>

  <p>"Master didn't ask us to kill those idiots. He just asked us to find out their motive. In fact, if the seven of us join together, we could easily kill them in the third stage," Pride said with disdain.</p>

  <p>As these two fiends were talking, a languid voice joined in the conversation. "We don't have to be in such a hurry. Since they can't get out of the encirclement of the Soul Devouring Bugs, we can wait a little longer."</p>

  <p>This voice belonged to the fiend called Sloth. Ever since entering the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region, he had been sleeping next to the magma lake.</p>

  <p>With the billowing heat coming of the waves of magma, he felt very comfortable here.</p>

  <p>"If we stay here longer, the Soul Devouring Bugs will run away. Aren't you afraid of our master?" Pride asked.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, the other fiends suddenly straightened up with a serious look on their faces.</p>

  <p>They knew the consequences they would have to face if they could not complete their task. The punishment from their master would be harsh, or unbearable, even.</p>

  <p>"Then let's get started." Sloth climbed up from the ground. Compared to the other fiends, his movements were immeasurably slow.</p>

  <p>But after he started to walk, his speed suddenly reached a horrifying level.</p>

  <p>Then, in the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p>

  <p>The other four fiends also rushed into the purple mist at the same speed.</p>

  <p>Tianming clasped his hands together and quietly stared at the thick purple mist.</p>

  <p>When the purple mist on his head had rolled over a hundred times, he was finally certain. "The purple mist is slowly dissipating."</p>

  <p>Tianming was the first one to confirm this. Soon, Jeremiah added, "Yes, the number of small bugs has also decreased."</p>

  <p>They were alert to even the subtlest of changes.</p>

  <p>"It seems that Nicholas' judgment was correct." Clark chuckled.</p>

  <p>To conquer the Abyss Demon Region, relying on one's own strength alone wouldn't be enough. Every step they took would have to be careful and calculated. And if these strange little bugs left on their own, it would be all the better for them.</p>

  <p>Nicholas sat there motionlessly, staring straight ahead. A hint of seriousness could be seen in his eyes. Then, he slowly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at him in confusion.</p>

  <p>Just like them, Nicholas couldn't release his spiritual sense. What could he see in the dense purple mist that they couldn't?</p>

  <p>Just then, Nicholas suddenly grabbed the air in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>A black shadow of a hand emerged from Nicholas' right arm and grabbed the air in the same way as him.</p>

  <p>"Argh!"</p>

  <p>The crowd shifted forward to take a closer look at the thing that had let out a scream.</p>

  <p>It was a monster that was less than two feet tall and looked like a dwarf.</p>

  <p>This dwarf wriggled and screamed hysterically in Nicholas' black hand shadow.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned. This little monster seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>And yet, Nicholas had noticed it.</p>

  <p>Nicholas firmly grasped the little monster in his hand, shook his head, and said, "I don't know. It moves very fast, even faster than me!"</p>

  <p>"Faster than you?" The Holy Beings were slightly shocked.</p>

  <p>"And there seems to be more than one," Nicholas added, turning his head to the other side.</p>

  <p>Samuel followed his gaze and abruptly grabbed the air behind Liusu before flicking his fingers.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Samuel's fingers held so much power that the little monster that had charged at Liusu at full speed flew backward like it weighed nothing.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Nicholas was surprised.</p>

  <p>He took a deep look at Samuel.</p>
