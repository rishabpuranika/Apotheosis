<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1885 The Sky Pearl (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Their fears originated from their innate instincts. No matter how powerful they were, terror still enveloped their bodies. Cold sweat trickled down their spine as they watched carefully at the sky.</p>

  <p>The blood of several legendary birds flowed within the blood of the members of the Skyland race. Quentin's pearl, however, contained the blood essence of the Heaven Duck, which was a true spirit in the divine land and could be called the lord of all birds. They were no match for the most powerful legendary bird.</p>

  <p>Countless formidable birds roamed the endless deep space of the divine land. There were legendary beasts like the Roc and the Phoenix, but without a doubt, the lord of all the birds was the Heaven Duck. It was at the top of the pyramid among all birds.</p>

  <p>As the cry of the Heaven Duck reverberated from the sky, the members of the Skyland race felt an intense suppression. All of them had unpleasant expressions on their faces. A mix of shock and fear reflected in their eyes. However, none of the warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race, as well as those of other races, had such a feeling.</p>

  <p>The pearl on Quentin's chest was called the Sky Pearl. As a supreme primordial weapon, it could be only used once. Needless to say, it was a rare and precious treasure.</p>

  <p>Quentin felt powerless during his last fight against Zheng. Zheng's physical strength alone was not something that he could withstand.</p>

  <p>However, thanks to his prestigious clan, Quentin still had many tricks up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>When he had been given the Sky Pearl, he was reminded repeatedly by his family members that only in desperate times could he use the Sky Pearl. Even to the Qin Clan, the Sky Pearl was a rare and precious treasure, at least not something they could use casually.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng thought about taking Quentin's life. If only Quentin could swallow his pride and back down quietly, Zheng would have let him live.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Quentin had an impulsive temperament. Under the humiliation, his judgment became clouded with revenge as he only wanted to kill Zheng as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>He didn't notice that even Kaydan and Chapman had to retreat when they confronted Zheng.</p>

  <p>With the long cry of the legendary bird, the Sky Pearl suddenly burst apart, and a drop of chalcedony flowed out from it.</p>

  <p>It was as if a drop of green ink was dropped into water, and the chalcedony turned into flows of green liquid that diffused outward and shot into the center of Quentin's brows.</p>

  <p>Instantly, a green light covered his entire body. The aura around him strengthened a hundredfold. Power radiated from him as he became several times more powerful.</p>

  <p>It was not the aura of Quentin himself, but the aura of a true spirit.</p>

  <p>"God! It looks like Quentin is going to go all out." Liusu's face was painted with shock and caution. "Zheng, you have to be careful!"</p>

  <p>Liusu realized that she had somehow overdone it this time. She understood Quentin's spiteful personality, but she never expected that he would use the Sky Pearl. That precious treasure was allowed to be used only in life-or-death circumstances, and even Liusu knew of this.</p>

  <p>She thought that even if Zheng had taught this fellow a good lesson, he hadn't shown any killing intent and would not force Quentin into such a desperate situation.</p>

  <p>However, she still underestimated Quentin's pride. As he was humiliated like that, he could do anything out of revenge without any thought to the consequences.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, remember that you are just a secondary creature! It's useless no matter how strong you are! You are never qualified to fight me! Now let me show you how power is truly defined!" Quentin laughed maniacally as he spread open his arms and pounced towards Zheng, like a roc spreading its wings! Hatred painted his face as his murderous gaze laid upon Zheng.</p>

  <p>Instead of fear, surprise was seen at Zheng's face when he noticed Quentin's sudden burst of power. He now understood that the resources and treasures in the divine land truly defied his logic and imagination.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, Quentin actually didn't have the qualifications to fight him. The only outcome of their fight should have been the same as before, where Zheng would press him on the ground and humiliate him.</p>

  <p>However, after Quentin used the Sky Pearl, his strength had increased tremendously. He was probably much stronger than Kennan who used the Wishing Spell as well.</p>

  <p>And to think that he was only at the Spirit Transformation Realm! His newfound power made him even more prideful.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never heard of such a sudden power-up from his universe. The warriors and the treasures in the divine land were truly unfamiliar to Zheng.</p>

  <p>He never thought that the warriors in this plain was capable of such a feat!</p>

  <p>Of course, this was also because of Quentin's special position. Ordinary warriors in the divine land would not possess such powerful treasures like the Sky Pearl.</p>

  <p>The other warriors who were beaten by Zheng earlier once again revealed smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>They knew that Zheng had utterly infuriated Quentin. The consequences of being that target of this madman's rage would be disastrous. They were relieved when they saw that the Skyland race did not take any action to protect Zheng. Although Zheng had displayed outstanding strength before, they believed that he would not stand a chance against Quentin who had used his secret weapon.</p>

  <p>But once again, Zheng did something out of their expectations— he did not choose to retreat. His face reflected no fear as he continued to stand dignified and brave.</p>

  <p>Then, he activated all the power of his Nine Divine Stars as he jumped from the ground and charged toward Quentin.</p>

  <p>When Kaydan saw Zheng's actions, he chuckled and said, "This guy... I bet that he just doesn't want to destroy the platform."</p>
