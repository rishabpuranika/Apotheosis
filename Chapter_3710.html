<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3710 The Power Of Finger Light </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The shadow which had appeared was the Primeval Lord of Heaven himself.</p>

  <p>Even in the Eternal Scroll Painting, his ranking was quite high.</p>

  <p>In the past, it was he who led the human race to fight against the Element Spirit race face to face. Furthermore, he himself had killed many Moon Fire Slaves throughout his time.</p>

  <p>Although his real body was trapped and only his energy soul was left, it was not a problem for him to use the power left in the Creation Myth Temple to help Zheng resist the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Vibrations could be felt in the air as the battle started.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>A finger light drew an arc and shot towards the Moon Fire Slave in the front. The Moon Fire Slave collapsed to the ground with a loud thump, which was almost impossible to hear amidst the surrounding din.</p>

  <p>Clap! The finger light's force left thunder-like sounds.</p>

  <p>The power of the finger light could be considered extremely strong in Stage Seventeen. It was also at the top in Stage Twenty-eight, but it was no longer as terrifying as it was in Stage Seventeen.</p>

  <p>However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had experienced many battles. His experience harnessed not only his instincts, but also his skills. The finger light that pierced through the armor of the Moon Fire Slaves accurately pierced into the flames and through their spiritual cores.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The nine Moon Fire Slaves that surrounded them from all directions froze in place.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, the flames that were emitted from the armor gradually shrank, disappeared, and extinguished.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves were a kind of fire spirits, and the flames were their forms. Since their spiritual cores were broken and their flame bodies disappeared, the powerful armor on their bodies collapsed and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light and the several Twilight Mice that had deceived Zheng into coming in were all stunned. Their eyes were in a sort of daze and confusion was evident on their faces.</p>

  <p>What had just happened was indeed unexpected, for they really looked up to the Moon Fire Slaves. In fact, in their eyes, the Moon Fire Slaves were invincible.</p>

  <p>No one in Stage Twenty-eight could resist them. Even the ruler of Stage Twenty-eight couldn't resist the joint attack of several Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>It should have been a piece of cake for the nine Moon Fire Slaves to kill two human beings, who had mere physical bodies, in a confined space.</p>

  <p>But in a flash, the nine Moon Fire Slaves were killed! Their shock was unmatched. Amongst the crowd were gasps, dropped jaws, and pale faces.</p>

  <p>"Kill them! Kill them!" the Soul of Light ordered desperately, once he realized what had just happened.</p>

  <p>He had a high status, but after all, he was just a Soul of Light. It was impossible for him to fight against Feng Ge and Zheng.</p>

  <p>Following the man's order, those Twilight Mice all determinedly rushed towards Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly. He lowered his body and jumped high towards the sky. His feet landed directly on the top of the head of the Twilight Mouse positioned in front.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Twilight Mouse's head was directly crushed.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't stop. With a crisp crack of lightning, his fist had already smashed into the head of another Twilight Mouse.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>His body flashed a few times, and the several Twilight Mice had lost their heads.</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light's eyes widened as he watched the Twilight Mice being killed one by one by Zheng. Then, he realized that he should withdraw from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Just as he began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune, he saw a handful of green sand pouring over like rain. The Soul Restraining Sand fell on the surface of his Soul of Light, locking him on the Other Shore. Now, as much as he wanted to leave, he couldn't.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge clapped her hands to clean up the Soul Restraining Sand between her fingers. A small smile curled on her lips as she asked, "All this makes me want to know who will die now, us or you?"</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light's desire to survive was very strong. After realizing that he was unable to leave the Other Shore, he turned around and wildly ran towards a passageway in the cave.</p>

  <p>After all, he had been trained in the Soul City, so his escape speed was not slow.</p>

  <p>If he met another person, he might have been able to escape, but unfortunately, he met Zheng.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a loud bolt of lightning, Zheng suddenly appeared beside him. He stretched out his hand and gently pulled the Soul of Light. He was like a kite with a broken string, weightless, and was easily thrown back by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Let, let me go..." the man pleaded. His heart was pounding tremendously against his chest, and he struggled to catch his breath.</p>

  <p>"Besides ambushing us here, does the Element Spirit race have any other plans?" Zheng asked in a firm tone. His eyes were sharp, as if they were to pierce through whatever lies this man might stutter.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" the man answered immediately, afraid that Zheng didn't believe him. Fear was reflected in his eyes. Zheng tried to look deeper to see if there was malice in his answer. He then added, "Who would have thought that so many Moon Fire Slaves couldn't do anything to you? I thought even one Moon Fire Slave would be enough. What had happened was beyond my imagination."</p>

  <p>"Is this really the northwest corner of the Forbidden Rain City?" Zheng asked again. He was still unsure whether to trust this man's answers, but he needed to understand the situation better.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You will reach it as long as you go up through this passage. There are some Twilight Mice along the way but with your strength, you can pass through smoothly," the man said.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Feng Ge, whose eyes flashed with killing intent. Feng Ge nodded at him and a small smile formed on her thin and sharp lips.</p>

  <p>Before the man could react, Zheng's arms slightly curled his head.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light was like a fragile bubble, shattering and disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>They didn't really care who this person was. Since he was a human, it was most likely that he came from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>As for where the real Doyle was and whether he was killed or not, they could only investigate after they left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Following the direction given by the Soul of Light, Zheng and Feng Ge soon saw flat steps. Their every move was done with caution and all their senses were alert. After climbing up a certain distance, they heard some squeaks ahead. Then, bean-sized eyes floated from the darkness on both sides of the steps.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, as the man said, there scattered many Twilight Mice in this passageway.</p>

  <p>"Those Moon Fire Slaves are all dead below. I wouldn't mind killing the entire Twilight Mouse race as well. If you don't want to die, you can come up," Zheng said coldly. His eyes were sharp and alert and he said those words in all seriousness.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves were arranged by the Twilight Mice. The Twilight Mice were shocked when they heard that all nine of the Moon Fire Slaves had been killed.</p>

  <p>Even as creatures of Stage Twenty-eight on the Other Shore, they were still not qualified to participate in a battle of this level. Moreover, the Element Spirit race did not give an order to let them attack Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Squeaks echoed and soon, the eyes glowing in the darkness disappeared one by one.</p>

  <p>After the Twilight Mice left, Zheng continued to walk up with Feng Ge. After they came out from a square well, they saw neatly arranged star rings.</p>

  <p>"The Soul of Light didn't lie to us," Zheng said, nodding his head slightly as he sized up the star rings.</p>

  <p>In the Lust World, there were many star rings on each stage. Almost every ruling civilization had a star ring.</p>

  <p>However, many civilizations were still not able to reach a high stage. Now that it was Stage Twenty-eight, the number of star rings had decreased significantly. There were only more than 100 star rings in front of them, which meant that only more than 100 ruling civilizations had once come here.</p>

  <p>After finding the human race's star ring, Zheng immediately threw himself into it. Feng Ge immediately followed, imitating Zheng's posture. Then, the two of them turned into two white lights and flew into the sky.</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty-eight was under the rule of the Element Spirit race. If they knew that the Moon Fire Slaves had been killed, they would probably turn to the stage ruler. If that happened, there might be another fierce battle.</p>

  <p>Thus, the earlier they left, the better.</p>

  <p>In what seemed to be an instant, two beams of straight white light shuttled all the way and finally arrived at Stage Twenty-nine, where the Soul City was located.</p>
