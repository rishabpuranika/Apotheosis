<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 649 Imprisoned </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Cold, calculating eyes scrutinized the burly squadron of guards.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't gauge how skilled they were.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng was rounded up, the head of the guards, who sat behind the half-man, half-bird monster measured him up and ordered his men,"This guy is not a member of our clan but he used the Dragon Soar Arena without our permission. Lock him up for a thousand years before releasing him!"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, a small green ball appeared in each of the guards' hands. The balls shot out lines of green threads at Luo Luo Zheng and soon enough, he was bound tightly.</p>

  <p>The team of guards then dragged him away to the cyan city.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no chance to explain himself during the whole ordeal.</p>

  <p>'Imprison me for a thousand years! Are you kidding?' Luo Luo Zheng thought and smiled bitterly. "Cyan dragon, it seems the members of your Genuine Dragon family are not friendly!" he complained.</p>

  <p>"Ha! That's because you don't have the essence and blood of our Genuine Dragon family. Since you're not a member of our family in the Lower World, then you would be punished for using the Dragon Soar Arena without our permission. Don't worry, you'll be released after a thousand years," the cyan dragon said with a laugh. He thought that this wasn't a big deal. "I made this rule many years ago," he added.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon family was huge. In addition to genuine dragons, it also included different races that had blood relationships with it, such as the Dragon Lineage Human race. It was one of the powerful races in the Genuine Dragon Family.</p>

  <p>Many of these races lived in the Lower World, so the Genuine Dragon Family had built many Dragon Soar Arenas for the Lower World. These Dragon Soar Arenas were used to carry only the Genuine Dragon Family members to the Upper World. If anyone of other races tried to use it, they would be imprisoned for a thousand years as punishment.</p>

  <p>The young master of the Xue Clan who had reached the Internal Elixir Realm tried to use the Dragon Soar Arena. However, he failed because the cyan dragon had changed the divine texture on the Dragon Soar Arena. The funny thing was that because he didn't succeed, he narrowly escaped being imprisoned. Otherwise, he would die in the prison, since even an Internal Elixir Realm practitioner only lived until eight hundred years at most.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what to respond to what the cyan dragon said. He wasn't twenty years old yet. He could only live until three hundred years at most with his current cultivation base. He wouldn't even live to see a thousand years to be released.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy. I'm a member of the Genuine Dragon Family. Although I can't show up in public for some reason, I won't let them do anything harmful to you," the cyan dragon said lightly. Luo Luo Zheng felt a little relieved to hear that.</p>

  <p>After a while, they soon reached their destination.</p>

  <p>The city was so big that it had walls as high as a mountain.</p>

  <p>Some huge textures that spanned several miles were etched on the city wall. They interlaced with each other and made a complex pattern.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the textures on the wall with awe. He wanted to look at them for a bit longer, but he was being dragged by the guards. "They're divine textures! Wow! They're so huge!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed. "Did you draw them?" he asked. The cyan dragon explained with a laugh,"Ha! This city belongs to the Dragon Lineage Human race, who are a collateral descendant of our family. It is used exclusively for greeting the family members from the Lower World. Why would I have drawn this for them?" I won't even draw textures for the main cities of the Dragon Lineage Human race!" he added.</p>

  <p>In terms of skills, the cyan dragon might not be the best in the Genuine Dragon Family. However, he had every reason to be proud when it came to the divine textures. After all, he had drawn the Grand Marvelous Array, which was the core protection array of the Genuine Dragon Family. In the Genuine Dragon World, there were many cities of such kind. The cyan dragon obviously wouldn't draw divine textures for them.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, the guards dragged Luo Luo Zheng through the city gates.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng carefully sized up each person he could along the way. However, he couldn't figure out their cultivation base, except for a few of them who were Illuminating Soul Realm masters, and some were even Internal Elixir Realm masters. It was clear that the members of the Dragon Lineage Human race knew some mysterious method that hid their real cultivation base. Luo Luo Zheng thought that they must have extremely high cultivation levels.</p>

  <p>After a while of traveling, Luo Luo Zheng was taken to a grey building with drab iron fences around it. Luo Luo Zheng knew they were in the prison now.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, Luo Luo Zheng was stuffed behind the iron bars near the prison's entrance. Then, the iron door was closed with a bang.</p>

  <p>Some prisoners, who were either lying down or sitting on the ground were scattered in the cell. Some of them meditated in a cross-legged position.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at them and realized that some of them were Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners, Internal Elixir Realm practitioners, and even a few Virtual Tribulation Realm masters. They weren't from the Central Region. Luo Luo Zheng guessed that they might have come from different areas of the Lower World. They must've been considered powerful in where they came from.</p>

  <p>"They must be the stowaways who, like me, tried to come to this world through the Dragon Soar Arena. They will be imprisoned for a thousand years too!" Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. It was definite a bad idea to come here through the Dragon Soar Arena if a person had no essence and blood of the Genuine Dragon Family.</p>

  <p>In the Lower World, Virtual Tribulation Realm practitioners were highly powerful in the region where they came from. However, when they reached this city, they would be imprisoned for a thousand years and were as obedient as cats. This rule of the cyan dragon was so...</p>

  <p>"What shall I do now? Since you took me here, you must be able to find a way, right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. A light smile crossed the cyan dragon's lips.</p>

  <p>"Take out a piece of paper and the mixed ink," he said confidently.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and laid out the pre-mixed ink and a rune paper on the ground in front of him. A tinge of the cyan dragon's soul was released after he raised the rune brush. When it merged with the brush, Luo Luo Zheng began to draw on the paper.</p>

  <p>When the prisoners saw what Luo Luo Zheng was doing, they grew curious. "I didn't expect that you're a runic expert. Why did you come here through the Dragon Soar Arena?" a practitioner asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was just a step away from the Illuminating Soul Realm, he might be the lowest among these stowaways in terms of cultivation level.</p>

  <p>He didn't respond and continued to focus on drawing the divine texture instead.</p>

  <p>"Hey! I'm talking to you! Are you deaf?"</p>

  <p>The practitioner who had asked Luo Luo Zheng was an Internal Elixir Realm master.</p>

  <p>He was an arrogant person in the Lower World, so he couldn't help but be enraged when Luo Luo Zheng, a nature creature, had ignored him.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so noisy? If you shout again, we'll kill you!" several guards yelled as they walked towards the cell with spears in their hands.</p>

  <p>The practitioner crouched on one side in fright and didn't dare to make any noise again. Before, the practitioners had tried to fight against these guards when they first got out of the Dragon Soar Arena. However, even the Virtual Tribulation Realm masters didn't get a chance to fight back before they were arrested. Moreover, this practitioner was just at the Internal Elixir Realm level so he was obviously no match for them.</p>

  <p>Some of the practitioners began to talk cautiously among themselves when they saw the divine texture Luo Luo Zheng had drawn. "It's unbelievable that he knows how to use Perfect Brushwork, at such a young age!"</p>

  <p>It was rare everywhere to see a runic expert who could use Perfect Brushwork.</p>

  <p>However, it wan't Luo Luo Zheng, but the cyan dragon himself who had drawn this divine texture. After the drawing was finished, the runic brush left a line of strange characters on the paper's margin. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't read any of these characters, so he guessed that they were the dragon texture marks the cyan dragon had drawn.</p>

  <p>"It's done! Give this divine texture paper to the guards and ask them to hand it over to the lord of the city," the cyan dragon said. Luo Luo Zheng nodded and collected the things on the ground.</p>

  <p>Then, he walked towards the gate of the cell and carefully knocked on the iron bar.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" a gruff voice asked. The guards walked over and looked at Luo Luo Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>"Please help me give this to the lord of the city," Luo Luo Zheng said and passed that paper of divine texture to the guards.</p>

  <p>"The lord?" They looked at each other in surprise, then burst into laughter. "Our city lord? Don't you know what a big man he is?"</p>

  <p>"These practitioners from the Lower World all acted the same way. Who do they think they are!"</p>

  <p>"That's why we should keep them in the prison for a thousand years. This is the only way they'll know what kind of place this is!" the guards said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't annoyed by what they said. He just waved the paper of divine texture in his hand and said,"Can you have a look at it before deciding to hand it over to the city lord or not?"</p>

  <p>The guards glanced at the paper upon hearing Luo Zheng's words. When one of them saw the dragon texture marks on the margin, he was shocked. He grabbed the paper from Luo Zheng's hand and asked in a trembling voice,"Where did you get this?"</p>
