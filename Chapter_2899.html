<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The arrival of the people from the Sword Clan and the Luo Clan made the fairy palace even more crowded.</p>

  <p>Even Mike hadn't expected the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands to break through the Everest Spirit Mountain in just three days.</p>

  <p>It meant that the Swirl Forest had become an extremely dangerous place to be in.</p>

  <p>After a short discussion, the Holy Beings in the fairy palace finally persuaded Mike to let everyone retreat to the outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>While Holy Beings could freely enter and exit the divine land, the rest of the members of the Luo Clan, the Moon Clan, and the Sword Clan, even consummate True Gods like Harold and Augustus, could only hide in the inner worlds of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"They could break through the Everest Spirit Mountain, but they won't be able to break through my Swirl Forest. It's good at defending against all kinds of attacks. I..." Augustus interjected, dissatisfied with the direction in which the Holy Beings' discussion was going.</p>

  <p>But before he could finish his words, Hallet hit him on his head, signaling for him to shut up.</p>

  <p>"Even if we retreat, I still have one request," Mike said. "We need to get Zheng to the Mountain of Holy Beings!"</p>

  <p>They had already discussed this before, and all the other Holy Beings had ruled that it was unnecessary. However, Mike kept insisting on it.</p>

  <p>The thing was, getting Zheng to the Mountain of Holy Beings was a risky operation.</p>

  <p>After all, the Mountain of Holy Beings was right next to the Time Sea. If the Yellow Emperor Guards managed to intercept them, they wouldn't have much chance of making it.</p>

  <p>Mulling over this problem just gave everyone a headache, but Mike refused to back off.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can leave the divine land first. I'll make a trip to the Soul Wilderness," Holy Jay said with a bitter smile. "Since Bromley is not here, I guess I'll have to be the mediator."</p>

  <p>The reason why Estelle had been locked up in the fairy palace was because of a relationship with Bromley.</p>

  <p>It was going to be really difficult to convince Estelle to help. If Bromley were here, it would be a small problem, but they had not seen Bromley for so many years.</p>

  <p>"Well, thank you, Holy Jay. I believe this will work. Zheng was the one who helped Estelle get out of the dungeon. After that, she made a move in the Evolutionary Universe and helped Zheng block the strike from Murphy. She even silenced the divine land once to help Zheng. Zheng and Estelle have some connection by fate. For this reason, I hope she'll help us," said Mike.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded. Although Estelle was willful, she was a sensible woman.</p>

  <p>She controlled the Soul Wilderness and enjoyed her life in that remote place. Moreover, she hadn't joined any forces, so it was almost impossible for the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands to take note of her.</p>

  <p>For now, Estelle was their best bet. If the Yellow Emperor Guards managed to take complete control of the divine land, however, things would change.</p>

  <p>After all, the Soul Wilderness was one of the four great forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>After Samuel claimed his status, their choices were limited. They would either have to join the alliance of powerful clans or be killed. There would be no other option.</p>

  <p>Once the discussion was over, everyone started to take action.</p>

  <p>The next day, Holy Jay went to the Death Spirit Region alone.</p>

  <p>With the existence of the Soul Wilderness, the whole Death Spirit Region was desolate. In the center of the Death Spirit Region was a large mountain range. The mountains were like ghosts that stretched unchecked. In the mountains, there was a stone arch, outside which there was a huge enchanted barrier. There were several transmission arrays that were arranged in this enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>However, these transmission arrays had already been destroyed.</p>

  <p>As soon as Estelle had returned, she had erased the transmission arrays at the entrance of the Soul Wilderness and cut off the way to the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>However, the restrictions around the entrance hadn't been removed. If Holy Jay were to make a move, it would cost him a lot of time to break the restrictions. Obviously, he didn't have the patience to do all that.</p>

  <p>Instead, he walked to the enchanted barrier of the Soul Wilderness, reached out his hand, and let a strong soul fluctuation seep into the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Since Estelle and the Soul Wilderness were connected, she would surely sense his presence. All that was left to see was whether she was willing to come out to help or not.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had no idea what she would choose to do.</p>

  <p>His friend Bromley was arrogant, but so was Estelle. She was unrelentingly stubborn and could hold a grudge against something for her whole life.</p>

  <p>There was a good possibility that she would just ignore him completely.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his worries turned out to be nothing as a crack appeared in the enchanted barrier of the Soul Wilderness and he received Estelle's invitation.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stepped into the Soul Wilderness, a gust of cold wind swept toward him. This cold wind contained various kinds of soul power.</p>

  <p>Ordinary True Gods would die in just a few seconds under the pressure of this wind, but it wasn't a problem for Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>Sizz...</p>

  <p>Wisps of brown aura entwined together and transformed into Estelle's features.</p>

  <p>Estelle looked at Holy Jay and asked coldly, "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"I came here to ask you for help," Holy Jay said politely.</p>

  <p>Among Holy Jay, Bromley, and Mike, Holy Jay was the one who had the best temper; that was the reason he had taken the initiative to come here.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Estelle fell into deep thought. Her thick eyelashes flickered as she asked, "Has Bromley come back?"</p>

  <p>As Holy Jay looked at Estelle's expression, his heart skipped a beat. It seemed there was still hope that he could succeed in persuading Estelle to come out. At least she didn't really hate Bromley. He shook his head and said, "If Bromley came back, the first thing he would do is to come here to see you."</p>

  <p>"Really? Would he dare to come?" Estelle raised her eyebrows and continued, "If he dares to take one step into the Soul Wilderness, I will kill him."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay smiled helplessly. He knew that there was no use adding to this topic, so he chose to keep silent.</p>

  <p>Estelle then asked, "If Bromley hasn't come back, what have you come here for?"</p>

  <p>"It's because of Zheng," said Holy Jay seriously.</p>

  <p>"You mean that kid?" Surprise appeared on Estelle's face. "He released me from the dungeon, and I've helped him twice to return the favor."</p>

  <p>"I want you to help him for the third time," Holy Jay said, cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>Estelle went silent for a moment. She did not have any ill feelings toward Zheng. When she had stayed in the Evolutionary Universe for a short period of time, she had learned something about the fate that Zheng carried.</p>

  <p>However, after she had helped him in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, the petal that had been hidden between Zheng's eyebrows had disappeared. Estelle had no idea what had happened to him after that.</p>

  <p>Finally, she asked, "What do you want me to do? Has he rescued Mike?"</p>

  <p>Noticing the hint of concern in Estelle's voice, Holy Jay was delighted.</p>

  <p>Estelle's attitude meant that it would be easy for the conversation to proceed.</p>

  <p>Since she was not an outsider, Holy Jay did not want to hide anything from her, so he told her in detail about everything that had happened after Zheng had stepped into the divine land. When Estelle heard all the unbelievable things that had happened to Zheng, she was astonished.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later...</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, she said, "I knew that this guy would make a splash. He was able to confront Nicholas in such a short time! I didn't expect him to be able to do that. Bromley really has an eye for talent..."</p>

  <p>Zheng was Bromley's disciple.</p>

  <p>If Estelle had never had those conflicts with Bromley, she might have become the wife of Zheng's master.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Bromley spotted him. And even Mike insisted that Zheng become Bromley's disciple. That's why we need your help. On the day that the Mountain of Holy Beings opens, we need everything to go smoothly. We already have the support of a powerful master at the Other Shore Realm, but if we have your support too, we could be sure that nothing will go wrong," Holy Jay said cautiously.</p>

  <p>"A powerful master at the Other Shore Realm? Who's this person?" Estelle asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Although she was living here remotely, she knew a lot about what was going on in the divine land. And as far as she knew, the only people at the Other Shore Realm who were in the divine land right now were the few Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>"It's someone from the Nine Li race. He has been in seclusion this whole time, but on the day that the Mountain of Holy Beings opens, he will also come out to help us," Holy Jay said seriously.</p>
