<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Though the Wing King had accepted the Night Being race by asking them to climb onto his back earlier, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others were still dubious about them.</p>

  <p>After all, the Night Being race couldn't even handle the six-headed eagles.</p>

  <p>What made them think they could deal with the more powerful Treacherous Being?</p>

  <p>However, the leader of the Night Being race did prove himself. Now, everyone looked to him expectantly.</p>

  <p>While the Treacherous Being was howling in front of the statue, Zheng had already transmitted the words he had heard into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had deciphered them and announced the translation, "I remember...</p>

  <p>My name is Campbell.</p>

  <p>I want revenge!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard these words, their hearts skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>These words revealed two pieces of information.</p>

  <p>Firstly, the Treacherous Being's name was Campbell, and secondly, he had an enemy.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being was a soul from the Instant Civilization, so logically, his enemy could not be the Element Spirit Civilization or the Nihility race. This meant that his enemy must be from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"Who is his enemy?" Zheng asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think is qualified to be an enemy of a human spirit?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked back.</p>

  <p>"Given the strength of the Four Spirits Sect, no creature in the Abstruse Energy World could've been strong enough to fight them," Zheng said, as he put two and two together. Then, his eyes lit up. "The enemy of the human spirit might be the other three spirits!"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "There must be some sort of conflict within the Four Spirits Sect. Otherwise, this would not have happened."</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder in the Eternal Scroll Painting was unwilling to reveal anything more, so Zheng had to piece together the information he got by himself.</p>

  <p>From what the Treacherous Being said, Zheng had gotten the gist.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being stopped howling, but it continued to run like a wild animal.</p>

  <p>Beside the huge pool was a passageway paved with cyan stones. At the end of the passageway stood a door.</p>

  <p>After the Treacherous Being pushed the door open, a vast world suddenly appeared in front of Zheng. In the blink of an eye, he was surrounded by a beautifully haunting sky full of stars.</p>

  <p>Countless blazing dots of light were densely packed together in the sky, seemingly so far away.</p>

  <p>Zheng was completely entranced by the vastness of the starry sky; it seemed like he was being sucked into it.</p>

  <p>"It's the Abstruse Energy World." Zheng realized.</p>

  <p>"Who would've thought this place was so close to the outside of the chaos..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, his eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>Stars in the sky weren't a rare sight. They could be seen in many places of the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>However, those places were very far away from the stars, and there was an impenetrable force field that divided these places from the stars above. Up until now, no one had been able to cross this force field. The Eternal Realm warriors and the creatures in the Three Purities Stage couldn't explore the Abstruse Energy World, because the only path was controlled by the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, look into the distance," Zheng shouted in excitement.</p>

  <p>The two of them looked into the distance and saw huge round trays floating in the air with a pillar running down the center. These trays resembled water lilies floating on the surface of the water, and the pillar extended down to the void like the root of water lilies.</p>

  <p>The round trays varied in size, and Zheng realized that he and his group were on a small tray.</p>

  <p>After observing for a while, the Primeval Lord of Heaven said affirmatively, "This is likely to be the highest realm of the Three Purities Stage, the Jade Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I agree." Zheng nodded in a daze.</p>

  <p>In fact, when they were being dragged by the fish hooks, they had already speculated about this, but they were not too sure. After all, this might just be a special space.</p>

  <p>However, with the round trays and the Abstruse Energy World so tangibly close, they realized the truth.</p>

  <p>"Well then, the passage where we are trapped should also lead to the Jade Pure Realm. I wonder which tray it leads to," the Primeval Lord of Heaven remarked with a look of epiphany.</p>

  <p>At first, he had thought that only one road could be opened up in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, namely the one where the thirty-nine human heroes were trapped.</p>

  <p>Only after the Eternal Realm Hunters sent some information about the Myriad Pagoda Mountains through the Wing King did the Primeval Lord of Heaven realize that there was more than one road. Besides the one that had trapped them, the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race each mastered three more.</p>

  <p>In the past, no one knew where these roads would lead to.</p>

  <p>But now, they finally understood.</p>

  <p>Every road eventually led to the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>However, the Jade Pure Realm was apparently made up of large and small round trays, and different roads led to different trays.</p>

  <p>The crowd behind Zheng also looked around with awe, their eyes practically popping out of their skulls.</p>

  <p>"This must be the Jade Pure Realm!"</p>

  <p>"It's a branch of the Jade Pure Realm..."</p>

  <p>"The Myriad Pagoda Mountains are indeed the keys to the Jade Pure Realm!"</p>

  <p>Everyone whispered amongst themselves excitedly. The Treacherous Being, however, continued to move forward.</p>

  <p>Although the round tray they were standing on was small compared to the other ones, its diameter was roughly ten miles.</p>

  <p>With every step the Treacherous Being took, a strange pattern would appear on the ground. These were not Sanskrit words, so Zheng didn't bother asking the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher them.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the Treacherous Being stopped beside one of the patterns and made Zheng gently stomp his foot.</p>

  <p>Then, the ground trembled.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>Stone pillars suddenly emerged from beneath the patterns.</p>

  <p>Exactly two hundred stone pillars emerged, all neatly arranged in a row.</p>

  <p>Each pillar was hollow inside, where silver armors were stored.</p>

  <p>The armors and weapons came in different shapes and sizes, but they all seemed to be of the same style.</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Beings must've used these things before they died," the Primeval Lord of Heaven posited.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan saw the shining armors, their eyes lit up in excitement.</p>

  <p>If the human spirits were from the Instant Civilization, then these things belonged to the Instant Civilization. Their grades could not be defined in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being walked to one of the stone pillars and put its hand into it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The armor in the stone pillar let out a sharp sound and started to tremble.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Each piece of the armor flew out eagerly. As though they knew Zheng was their master, they attached themselves to his shoulders, head, neck, chest, and legs.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng was fully clad in the armor, and then a silver spear appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being lifted the silver spear.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A bright silver light was released from the armor and spear.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a terrifying aura of energy was also emitted.</p>

  <p>The moment everyone felt the energy, they all retreated quickly.</p>

  <p>They didn't stop until they were several thousand feet away from Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The energy contained in the armor is so terrifying!" The Snake Goddess said, trembling in fear.</p>

  <p>"Of course. It belongs to the Instant Civilization."</p>

  <p>King Ieuan rolled its eyes. It turned its attention to the armors stored within the pillars.</p>

  <p>They had gone through a lot of hardships to get here. How could they return home empty handed?</p>
