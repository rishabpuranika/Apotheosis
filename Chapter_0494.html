<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>He could only scream in anger. "Grey, you bastard! I'll fucking kill you!"</p>

  <p>There was only a sinister smile on Grey's face.</p>

  <p>Then he raised a thick stick he held in one hand, lifted it up, and smashed it hard against the child's legs.</p>

  <p>"Snap!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The sound of fractured leg bones came after the stick's heavy blows.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!"</p>

  <p>"Ouch!"</p>

  <p>"Aaaahhhh!"</p>

  <p>The child screamed in agony as his legs were broken by Grey.</p>

  <p>The two strong men then carelessly threw the child away. His smaller body tumbled down the stairs and he lay in pain on the ground.</p>

  <p>This child proved to be really stubborn. Even with his broken legs, he still wanted to climb back to the gates of the Luo house. He pulled himself up heavily on the steps as droplets of blood fell on the ground.</p>

  <p>The servant who swept the grounds looked at the scene and sighed. The blood stained the steps and he would have to clean them again.</p>

  <p>It did not mean that he felt no sympathy for the child. He had worked diligently for the Luo clan for several decades, and had deep feelings for the family.</p>

  <p>It was just that the current Luo family was no longer the family it used to be.</p>

  <p>These things occurred almost several times every month, and he had gotten used to it. It was nothing he could handle. It was clear that the Luo family was problematic, but what could he do as a mere servant?</p>

  <p>"Come on! Climb up here!" Grey said.</p>

  <p>He went up the steps and kicked the child in the chest. The little boy had managed to climb up the stairs, but he fell down again.</p>

  <p>"You climb so slowly, like a tortoise!" one of the strongmen laughed.</p>

  <p>The other one laughed as well.</p>

  <p>The servant only shook his head and continued to sweep the ground. Just then, he spotted two people who headed to the house not too far away.</p>

  <p>They turned out to be a man and a woman.</p>

  <p>The man looked quite handsome. His eyes were bright as if they were lit by the stars themselves.</p>

  <p>The woman was unnaturally beautiful. She looked like a goddess from the heavens. To look at her he felt like he had desecrated her.</p>

  <p>'Who are they?' the servant thought.</p>

  <p>'Why are they heading to the Luo house? Are they just passing by?'</p>

  <p>He had so many questions in his mind.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he stopped thinking those thoughts because the man and woman were in front of the gate of the Luo house.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked to the gate, followed by Yan.</p>

  <p>The beautiful scenery of their hometown, C County, made them happy upon their arrival. However, the happiness faded as they got closer to the Luo house.</p>

  <p>When they saw what had happened at the door, Zheng couldn't restrain himself any longer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the child continued to desperately climb up the stairs. He was in such severe pain that he had gone pale. It was only by sheer will that he managed to climb up the steps.</p>

  <p>He knew that no matter how hard he tried, it would be in vain. But as a child of the Luo family, there were some things worthy to fight for at the cost of his life!</p>

  <p>When he had climbed up to the gate once again, he suddenly found two people who stood next to him. He didn't know them. 'Who are they?</p>

  <p>Why do I feel that the man's face looks familiar?' he thought.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng squatted down beside the child.</p>

  <p>"Tristan, what are you doing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>'Why does he know my name?' Tristan was confused. He was so curious that he had forgotten the pain of his broken legs. He gritted his teeth and struggled to talk.</p>

  <p>"I'm going home. Grey, that fucking bastard. He has no right to kick me out of my house!" he spat out.</p>

  <p>"Attaboy," Zheng said. Then he took out a pill from his space ring and gave it to Tristan. "Take it and then climb back. There are no black sheep in our Luo clan!"</p>

  <p>Tristan slowly raised one hand and took the pill.</p>

  <p>"A pill?" Although he was badly hurt, he could still distinguish the pill and its value. It must be worth a lot of money. Tristan swallowed the pill without hesitation.</p>

  <p>A warm feeling soon pooled in his stomach and a cool sensation hit his legs. The wounds on his body healed quickly at a fast rate. After a while, the pain in his legs had disappeared completely!</p>

  <p>'What kind of pill is this?</p>

  <p>How can it heal my wounds instantly?</p>

  <p>I'm afraid that the best pill in my Luo family can't be compared to this pill. It is 100 times more effective than the best pill in the Luo family, '</p>

  <p>Tristan thought.</p>

  <p>He was definitely shocked. He turned over after a bit and stood up from the ground.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Grey and his men became angry.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you meddle in our business?" he asked furiously. He could see that Zheng and Yan weren't ordinary people, but he didn't recognize them.</p>

  <p>It was normal for him not to recognize Yan since she was only a little girl when she left the Luo house. Now, she had grown into a beautiful young lady.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he had changed a lot. He was now in his teens, and the cultivation had made his figure bulkier. His temperament was even more impressive, and his appearance was quite handsome.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Grey and Tristan didn't recognize them at once.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Yan didn't seem to hear what Grey said. Zheng turned to Tristan and said, "Tristan, let's go home." Tristan looked at him confusedly.</p>

  <p>Go home?</p>

  <p>He was surprised at Zheng's words. 'Did he say go home? Only the children of the Luo clan can call this place home, right?'</p>

  <p>Suddenly, something flashed in Tristan's mind. He then looked at Zheng with wide, ecstatic eyes.</p>

  <p>When he was about to call Zheng's name, Zheng nodded at him. He put his hand on Tristan's shoulder, his eyes filled with resolution. He turned to Yan and nodded to her as well.</p>

  <p>"Come on, let's go home!"</p>
