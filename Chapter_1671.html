<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A man who had been away three days must be looked at with new eyes.</p>

  <p>But Tianming's progress still surprised Luo Zheng immensely.</p>

  <p>It hadn't been long since Tianming's ascension, so it was evident that he had already come upon an extremely valuable opportunity while he was on the savage land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only wonder what kind of wonders the savage land hid to help Tianming improve so much in such a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not able to cultivate his sword intent to the perfection even after crossing the Hall of Causality and practicing his sword strikes with Supreme Lord Sword for a long time.</p>

  <p>According to Supreme Lord Sword, Zheng's sword intent was till defective.</p>

  <p>This defectiveness prevented him from reaching the peak of the Emotion Closing Godly Way and achieving the ultimate sword intent.</p>

  <p>But Tianming had displayed something extremely powerful yet equally mysterious just now. Not even Luo Zheng seemed to have understood this ultimate sword intent he had used.</p>

  <p>Numerous purple thunderbolts, all loaded with devastating energy, rushed towards Tianming.</p>

  <p>One thunderbolt would be enough to completely incinerate a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior instantly!</p>

  <p>But when these thunderbolts went against Tianming's ultimate sword intent, they all exploded one by one.</p>

  <p>These explosions were deadly as the bolts scattered into numerous, web-like currents of electricity in the air.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The Heaven Earth Board turned purple from the continuous thunderstorm. Gaping, ominous holes appeared in the sky one by one as the Heaven Earth Board was struck with a devastating storm of pure, electric power.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>These thunderbolts were still unable to cause Tianming any harm.</p>

  <p>The earth was struck again and again, but the area around the young man remained pristine and untouched.</p>

  <p>Two-hundred and ninety-eight warriors and the entire universe were witnesses to this event.</p>

  <p>The one-hundred and twenty-eight Supreme Lords were, of course, also watching. All of them were quiet and currently assessed the situation in front of them. They never thought that two warriors at the Soul Sea Realm could provide them with such an interesting and powerful show.</p>

  <p>None of them had ever imagined such young people already having that kind of destructive power.</p>

  <p>But there was always time for surprises. What was unimaginable in the past could very well be the norm for the future.</p>

  <p>"The more powerful these kids are, the more serious this round of crisis will be."</p>

  <p>The coming world of chaos served as a catalyst. It was an event where people gathered all their resources and poured them into their fostered talents who were extremely powerful. These talents were all products of the universe's own, self-protective mechanism.</p>

  <p>It had sensed an incoming crisis, one more devastating than before, and it needed equally powerful talents to counter this said catastrophe.</p>

  <p>This fact had already been observed and confirmed by a number of Supreme Lords from the precious books that had been passed down from the last grand era.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>The more talented and powerful the warriors of this generation were, the more serious the universe's crisis would be. None of them could even imagine just how terrible the crisis of the world of chaos would be this time.</p>

  <p>Back then, Soul Sea Realm warriors had a lot of difficulty in fighting against their Spirit Supreme Realm seniors.</p>

  <p>However, these young warriors today proved a match against Spirit Transformation Realm warriors who had already established their own inner worlds for quite some time.</p>

  <p>Tianming's and Xenia's strength greatly worried them.</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, Supreme Lords reigned in terms of power.</p>

  <p>Obtaining a Heavenly Destiny strengthened a warrior's power. However, this power and potential were also restrained to prevent him from surpassing the heavens.</p>

  <p>If a world lord's Lotus Flower could bloom thirty-six lotus petals then there would be a chance for him to surpass the heavens but this possibility was extremely small.</p>

  <p>But these young warriors in front of them were obviously capable of blooming the thirty-six petals despite only being in the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>These talents were all precious existences but it was unfortunate that they were born so close to the oncoming world of chaos. They served as the products of the universe's instinct of self-preservation and would no doubt be instrumental in the coming crisis.</p>

  <p>Core talents usually lived for millions of years after becoming world lords.</p>

  <p>But these young talents might not be granted this opportunity of a long life. Their responsibilities to the universe might cut their time short to dozens of years, or hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The thunderbolts had finally ceased, leaving Tianming as an upright beacon of strength on the mountain. His smile was unchanged and his scabbard remained on the ground as if nothing happened.</p>

  <p>The only sign of the thunderbolts' devastation was the annular ravine that formed around the young warrior. The immediate board that surrounded him was the only part that survived.</p>

  <p>The stones, however, were undamaged. Some even floated in midair once the board underneath was bombed into smithereens.</p>

  <p>"That guy, he's called Tianming?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Tianming from the Thoughtless Minds..."</p>

  <p>"Where is he from? I remember him saying that he came from a place called Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. Cloud Hall might be some small sacred place he used to live in before." "That's even more ridiculous. How can a small sacred place ever have such a powerful warrior?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't heard of such a place either."</p>

  <p>Not many of the warriors present were willing to believe that Tianming had come from such humble origins.</p>

  <p>That was simply impossible given the power he just showed them.</p>

  <p>All Godly Geniuses came from the great forces after all.</p>

  <p>The ogres, Demon Night race, Humanity Alliance, and Blessed Buddha Land all had one while the Thoughtless Minds and Celestial Position had two.</p>

  <p>These Godly Geniuses came from all the great forces and races - no exception.</p>

  <p>Why? Simply because small forces and sacred places lacked the resources needed to foster great warriors in their ranks.</p>

  <p>A gifted warrior with the capacity to become a Godly Genius would never realize his full potential in a small force due to a lack of resources.</p>

  <p>He would, at most, be an ace talent or even a common core talent.</p>

  <p>All things built for greatness must have a strong foundation.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the tenth-grade sacred place to which Tianming ascended was currently ecstatic.</p>

  <p>Even if the young man told others that he came from a place called Cloud Hall, the fact remained that he still ascended to his sacred place.</p>

  <p>Tianming's power now seemed to have surpassed a normal ace talent's and might actually even be on par with a Godly Genius'.</p>

  <p>A potential Godly Genius from their sacred place? Such a thought would make any Saint Lord's toes curl in excitement!</p>

  <p>Before Tianming entered the Illusion Battlefield, this Saint Lord promised something.</p>

  <p>The one who ranked in the top one million would obtain a second-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>The one in the top one-hundred thousand would obtain a secondary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>And the one who managed to land himself in the top fifty thousand would obtain a first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>This Saint Lord's cultivation was only of a world lord and he himself had never owned a supreme divine weapon so he could only offer these things.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, he never really expected any of his warriors to be able to enter the top fifty thousand.</p>

  <p>He was currently at a loss on how to give Tianming what was promised.</p>

  <p>Where in the world was he going to find a treasure more precious than a first-rank divine weapon? However, he knew that as soon as the young man came back from the Illusion Battlefield, the four clans would most definitely come knocking.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord evidently overestimated the four clans' patience.</p>

  <p>Why wait for Tianming to come back? All four: the Xuan Yuan Clan where Nathan came from, the Ji Clan where Lucille came from, another Ji Clan where Janet came from, and the Lie Clan where Lawson came from, had already sent their respective groups to the tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Each of them sent a total of three groups. The first groups were sent when Tianming entered the top two thousand and five hundred.</p>

  <p>Tianming was a precious pearl and all of them were eager to recruit him in their ranks.</p>

  <p>Shocked was an understatement once they witnessed this young man's abilities. They were absolutely floored at Tianming's abilities!</p>

  <p>Recruiting him was definitely not going to be an easy task. Thus, they all realized that the earlier groups they sent wouldn't suffice. How could they ever hope to compete with the other clans in getting this prime talent if they sent in their weak underlings?</p>

  <p>This was why they sent in the second, stronger groups, far more superior than those dispatched earlier.</p>

  <p>The Xuan Yuan Clan leader currently watched Tianming and slapped his own head, "Damn it! He is a Godly Genius!" he muttered to himself. It was then that he decided to personally recruit this promising young warrior.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. The leaders of the other clans also thought the same thing.</p>

  <p>Seeing her attack failed to elicit any reaction from Tianming, Xenia displayed an obviously unhappy expression on her face. What was she going to do now?</p>

  <p>Tianming, on the other hand, didn't seem to be in any hurry.</p>

  <p>His scabbard was still on the ground as he watched Xenia think of her next move.</p>

  <p>This battle was an elimination round wherein the loser would have to go home while the winner would have a chance to have the Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>And warriors ranking among the top three would obtain better rewards.</p>

  <p>However, these things weren't that much of a concern as of the moment.</p>

  <p>The two simply concentrated on the battle happening between them right now.</p>

  <p>They were both competing to see who was more powerful. Both of them refused to rely on any underhanded tricks or schemes to ensure that they both fought with fairness. That was the only way either of them could be convinced of the oncoming result.</p>

  <p>Xenia stood there thinking for a while before eventually straightening up and looking at Tianming with a determined expression, "Alright. Let me try this."</p>

  <p>She held out her palm towards Tianming. There was a brief flash of light as bolts of lightning erupted from each finger.</p>

  <p>The electric current was like a deadly extension to each of her fingernails.</p>

  <p>The lightning bolts also connected to each other, spreading over her hand like a webbed electric flipper. Soon enough, her fingers began to transform into electricity itself.</p>

  <p>Then her arm, her shoulders, until her entire body was a pulsing, crackling, lightning bolt.</p>

  <p>Xenia's blood and flesh were nowhere to be found. Tianming's opponent was now pure electricity.</p>

  <p>He could barely make out a face and body from the electric current.</p>

  <p>Right now, no one could tell whether Xenia was a high-level Law Creature of the Thunder Law or a warrior.</p>
