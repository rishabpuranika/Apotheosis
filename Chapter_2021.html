<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>As the sword slashed down, Luo Zheng felt his hand go numb. The Annihilation Thunder was like a slippery fish. It quietly slipped away from Zheng's blade and returned to the screen once again!</p>

  <p>After he saw what happened, Mike shook his head. "The Enemy Repelling Arts is not a cultivation method to enhance one's strength. You can view the Causality Breaking Light as a kind of Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>The causality seems strong, but if there is no cause, then there will definitely be no effect. You can meditate on it and try to break the cause through the meditation. Then you can make a breakthrough. Got it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng calmed himself and tried to comprehend his father's words. Intense concentration was reflected in his expression.</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality was strong because it formed an integral whole.</p>

  <p>The cause was the origin of the Heavenly Destiny. It was like a newborn baby, and it was also the beginning of the Heavenly Destiny. The really scary thing was the effect, not the cause! However, if he severed the 'cause', the scary effect wouldn't be formed.</p>

  <p>What he needed to do was first to kill off the 'cause', and then there would be no more 'effect.' It was a simple yet effective tactic!</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Zheng gained a hint of understanding. A sly smile decorated his face as he comprehended the technique.</p>

  <p>"Let's do it again." Mike was always a strict person, so his demands of Luo Zheng would only be higher. The repeated practice was needed for Luo Zheng to grow faster.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng felt as if he had returned to his childhood. His father had taught him to read and practice his martial arts time and time again. Mixed emotions appeared in Zheng's heart as he reminisced his childhood.</p>

  <p>The bolt of Annihilation Thunder once again shot out from the screen.</p>

  <p>The moment it got close to Luo Zheng, the Causality Breaking Light in his hand flashed again, and he charged towards the Annihilation Thunder. His determination was apparent in Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The Annihilation Thunder was cut in half by Luo Zheng and returned to the screen once more. It was still agile and slippery.</p>

  <p>The causality hidden within the thunder was not severed. Luo Zheng had utterly failed again at that time...</p>

  <p>"Again! Do it once more." Mike shouted with a frown. Impatience was evident in his expression.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The Annihilation Thunder once again shot towards Luo Zheng. However, Luo Zheng failed to sever the connection every time.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Thus, the thunder struck Luo Zheng time and time again. However, it always returned to the screen and struck once more. The process was repeated a lot of times, but Luo Zheng still hadn't succeeded.</p>

  <p>Although the Annihilation Thunder was just a simple one and wasn't too powerful, it still caused Zheng's soul to tremble. Every time the Annihilation Thunder struck Luo Zheng, it would circulate his body and electrify his soul. The Annihilation Thunder had a detrimental effect on the soul, so it naturally affected Zheng's soul body.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Luo Zheng couldn't smoothly cut the cause, Mike became more and more serious!</p>

  <p>"If one Heavenly Destiny is insufficient to stimulate your potential, then I will release two to attack you! Luo Zheng, you better succeed, or this will hurt a lot!" As soon as Mike finished his words, another golden light of Heavenly Destiny appeared on the opposite screen. Within that Heavenly Destiny was a cool breeze. Then as the cool breeze continued to gather, it turned into a wind eagle and flew towards Luo Zheng at high speed!</p>

  <p>It was one of the mysteries of the tenth-layer Wind Law, the Spirit of Wind! Its precision and speed were at a high level.</p>

  <p>To stimulate all of Zheng's potential, Mike could only use this method to force him! He wanted to put more pressure on Luo Zheng in order to force Zheng's growth!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The wind eagle pounced towards Luo Zheng, but he slashed at it with his sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng's swing was very powerful that the sword cut into the wind eagle's body.</p>

  <p>However, this wind eagle was formed from a profound mystery of the Wind Law, so how could it fear Zheng's long sword? The eagle's form remained unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Rip�"</p>

  <p>The wind eagle's sharp claws painfully grabbed Zheng's shoulder. Even though Zheng's body was extremely durable, the Wind Law contained in the claws were extremely sharp. Two deep scratches were left on Zheng's shoulder after the eagle's fierce attack!</p>

  <p>After the wind eagle attacked Luo Zheng, it circled in the air and then returned to the screen...</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Zheng finished his battle with the wind eagle, the Annihilation Thunder struck him again!</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>The green lightning directly struck Zheng's head. Although Luo Zheng got the Gold Fighting Soul, he was still unable to withstand that attack. Luo Zheng felt his soul tremble, and his entire body fell to the ground. Darkness clouded his vision as he slowly lost consciousness.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Mike had his hands behind his back. With remorseless eyes, he looked at Luo Zheng on the ground. "Get up!" Mike shouted with a cold tone.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's face touched the path of golden light, although he felt dizzy, he clenched his teeth and stood up! Determination mixed with pain had shown up in his expression.</p>

  <p>However, just as he stood up and grabbed his sword, another wild purple flame lion appeared nearby!</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>It was one of the profound mysteries of the Fire Law, the Heavenly Destiny known as the Devouring Kindling. It was ferocious and lethal to its target.</p>

  <p>Over a billion years ago, there was a Supreme Lord in the Evolutionary Universe who had created such a Heavenly Destiny named Devouring Kindling. Although that Heavenly Destiny was a medium-level Law of Causality, it still allowed that Supreme Lord to be comparable to a top-rank Supreme Lord. That was a mighty Heavenly Destiny!</p>

  <p>The fire lion roared and pounced straight at Luo Zheng. Its ferocity remained unmatched. Claws as sharp as knives were seen in its paws.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't afraid of the Fire Law. However, the problem was that he had to resist the Heavenly Destiny within it.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng faced the ferocious fire lion, the Causality Breaking Light on his long sword got brighter and more brilliant. His face also revealed a resolute expression. At that moment, Luo Zheng clenched his teeth and roared,</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>A strange scene appeared�</p>

  <p>A misty ray of cyan light flashed as the sword chopped down the fire lion's head. The purple flames that had appeared on the surface of the purple fire lion instantly vanished without a trace. Zheng's powerful strike seemed to change the color of the fire lion. Additionally, the purple flames that spread from the fire lion turned to the ordinary flames...</p>
