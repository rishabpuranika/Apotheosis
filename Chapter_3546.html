<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3546 Royal Monkeys </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since Zheng found the clues regarding the black monkeys, he did everything he could to not let the opportunity slip through his fingers. Immediately, he proposed on accompanying the two green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>Unaware of the ongoing feud between Zheng and the black monkeys, the two creatures happily agreed to his offer with gratitude.</p>

  <p>Because the creatures were familiar with the area, not a single dangerous encounter occurred throughout the journey with them leading the group.</p>

  <p>Zheng even managed to learn more about the Insect Master race through them.</p>

  <p>The Insect Master race was a low-level race in the Dark Region. They lived by catching, raising, and taming insects.</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned creatures were insect catchers. Once they brought them back, they'd forward them to experts known as "insect raisers" that would be responsible for rearing them.</p>

  <p>After a certain period, they would then be relayed to the expert insect tamers.</p>

  <p>The insects that had previously attacked Zheng and Feng Ge were the ones that the Insect Masters had tamed.</p>

  <p>Mercer, the smaller green-skinned creature, and Miller, the taller one of the two, were brothers. They were elated knowing that they successfully and safely captured a Dark Nether Bug. Once they brought it back for their entire race to see, they'd be welcomed and hailed as heroes by the whole Insect Master race.</p>

  <p>After they advanced along the black mountain range for two hours, there was a huge crater in front of them. And in the crater, there were some messy steps.</p>

  <p>As they descended to the base of the rickety-looking staircase, they were met with densely-packed caves that flanked them on both sides.</p>

  <p>Numerous green-skinned creatures slipped in and out of the caves alongside numerous insects.</p>

  <p>These insects came in various, strange shapes and had vicious looks plastered on all their faces. Despite that, they were all obedient in this col.</p>

  <p>Once Miller and Mercer made their entrance, they lifted the bag they brought with pride and shouted in unison, "We've captured a Dark Nether Bug! We've caught one!"</p>

  <p>Instantly, all the green-skinned creatures dropped what they were doing and looked towards the duo's direction.</p>

  <p>The col had been enveloped in a deep depression.</p>

  <p>The Royal Monkey race was looming over everyone's heads like a guillotine ready to slaughter anyone who disobeyed. Over the past few days, the insect catchers failed to capture a Dark Nether Bug. If they still didn't catch one tomorrow, they would have nothing worthy to offer the Royal Monkey race.</p>

  <p>Five years ago, a similar situation occurred wherein no one could successfully capture a Dark Nether Bug. As punishment, the Royal Monkey race slaughtered nearly half of the Insect Master race. This time, failure might mean the total annihilation of their entire race.</p>

  <p>With Miller and Mercer's successful capture, everyone in the col cheered with joy and relief.</p>

  <p>Numerous green-skinned creatures emerged from the caves to gather around the duo for a closer look.</p>

  <p>As the two of them untied the bag, the Dark Nether Bug was revealed? barely mature, sleeping soundly, and totally unaware of the situation.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>No one knew who first started the roar. Wherever it came from, it managed to trigger all the green-skinned creatures to roar as well? a deafening whole reverberating along the cave walls and into the valley.</p>

  <p>With the roar continuing, a few of the green-skinned creatures came up with a black plate onto which they carefully placed the snoozing Dark Nether Bug and then they carried it away.</p>

  <p>By then, Mercer silenced the entire col with a quick wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Now," he began to speak, "we are saved thanks to these two guests. Let us prepare a nice treat for them!"</p>

  <p>Everyone began to cheer loudly once more.</p>

  <p>All of this noise didn't sit well with Feng Ge. In fact, she wanted to drag Zheng away right then and there and leave.</p>

  <p>They came here to get more information about the black monkeys, not to get stuck and witness the lives of a race in the lower class.</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled Feng Ge aside to stop her from leaving. "We're not leaving," he informed her with the shake of his head. "We're staying here until tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Realizing her pouting was useless, she finally gave in to his orders and agreed to stay.</p>

  <p>The Insect Master race concurred that a grand feast must be held to entertain Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>To their dismay and horror, all of the meals served were anything but appetizing? filled with bugs, larvae, and eggs that no human would consume unless they were desperate. Zheng politely refused each offer they made.</p>

  <p>Here in the Dark Region, the transition from day to night wasn't conspicuous. As outsiders to the Dark Region, Zheng and Feng Ge barely noticed when dawn turned to dusk, unlike the Insect Masters. 

Silence suddenly passed among all the Insect Masters.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Feng Ge ate a Darkness Fruit in secret as they waited quietly in the dark.</p>

  <p>Eight hours later...</p>

  <p>The sound of sudden, heavy footsteps came from the other side.</p>

  <p>"Clack clack clack clack..."</p>

  <p>They sounded like hooves.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted and raised his head towards the direction where the sound came from. A band of black monkeys riding on horseback came into view.</p>

  <p>The black monkey that led the group gently pulled his horse's mane. This caused the horse to neigh loudly and raise its chest and hooves to the sky. A bright, red light burst from the hooves just as the horse brought them back down to the ground? right on the edge of the col.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>As the entire col began to shake under the power, the two caves directly below the horse began to collapse. All the green-skinned creatures that resided in the caves were now trapped underneath the debris.</p>

  <p>As the tremors began to worsen, all of the green-skinned creatures came out of hiding. Flustered and frightened, they all diverted their attention towards the creatures riding on horseback who were responsible for this destruction? the Royal Monkey race.</p>

  <p>A few of the green-skinned creatures dropped to their knees and bowed towards the Royal Monkeys, hoping that would help to slightly suppress their rage.</p>

  <p>"Have you caught the bug we wanted?" the Royal Monkey at the helm asked in a high-pitched voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes! We have, Master Royal Monkey!"</p>

  <p>A group of green-skinned creatures momentarily left to retrieve the black plate and carry it towards the Royal Monkeys. The plate was now decorated and in the middle of the plate appeared the fairly young Dark Nether Bug, still sound asleep.</p>

  <p>They climbed up the slope on the side of the col as they delivered their offering.</p>

  <p>The Royal Monkey glanced at it and said, "One isn't enough. I want two."</p>

  <p>"Two?"</p>

  <p>"For many years, one is enough. How come this time we have to hand in two?"</p>

  <p>"But we only caught one Dark Nether Bug!"</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures' faces turned pale. It was useless trying to reason with these monkeys. Already, they were imagining in their minds the consequences that they would bestow on their race.</p>

  <p>"This time is different. Our stage ruler is ravenous. What? Can't you offer another one?" A hint of coldness could be felt in the Royal Monkey's voice now.</p>

  <p>The Royal Monkeys thought that these green-skinned creatures were useless now. Why keep them alive when they could easily reproduce hundreds or thousands more incompetent beings into this world?</p>

  <p>If they couldn't hand in one more Dark Nether Bug, then that would give enough reason for them to kill these creatures off.</p>

  <p>An eerie silence fell over the green-skinned creatures, fearing that a single sound uttered would just enrage the Royal Monkey even further. No one dared to answer his question.</p>

  <p>Miller and Mercer also looked anxious. There were three Dark Nether Bugs in Feng Ge's hands, but the stage ruler only ate living Dark Nether Bugs and would not touch any dead ones.</p>

  <p>If only they'd known this would happen, they would've stopped Feng Ge from killing all of them. Oh how they wished to turn the tables right then and there!</p>

  <p>Neither of them knew that even if they had two in their hands, the Royal Monkeys would still require them to offer a third one. As the old saying went, "He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick."</p>

  <p>Just as all of the green-skinned creatures were about to give up, Zheng's voice floated up from the bottom of the col. "I have what you want? another Dark Nether Bug."</p>
