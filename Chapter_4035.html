<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4035 Cat And Saber </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, most Eternal Realm warriors and Other Shore creatures felt apprehensive at the mention of the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>After all, most of them had only encountered the killing type and the attaching type, which were the most common types of Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>The various kinds of Treacherous Beings all had different personalities and obsessions. Some of them were naturally kind-hearted and helpful to others.</p>

  <p>This type of Treacherous Beings was called the friendly type.</p>

  <p>The friendly type was further divided into different kinds. Some of them readily helped others while they stuck to their principles, while others trusted unconditionally and were willing to do anything.</p>

  <p>The latter kind was the sort of Treacherous Beings that could be used as weapons.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being in Darby's glazed glass was called the Three-clawed Beast. It was a hostility-level Treacherous Being with powerful attacks.</p>

  <p>After Darby got the Three-clawed Beast from his master, he was only allowed to practice with it a few times before he had to seal it in the glazed glass. Furthermore, his master warned that he should never use it unless absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>However, the Light of Annihilation was not enough to defeat these Treacherous Beings of the attaching type. Left with no other choice, Darby finally was forced to use the Three-clawed Beast to deal with the three members of the Bone Blade race.</p>

  <p>The moment Darby finished his explanation, an ear-piercing scratching sound suddenly came from behind them.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A giant cat, made up of countless eyeballs, appeared on the Pure Sky Platform!</p>

  <p>It seemed that something had hit it. Due to the strong impact, it almost slid off the Pure Sky Platform and fell into the space outside it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, a few hundred feet away from the Pure Sky Platform was still a safe distance. However, the space further than that devoured energies and everything else into nothingness.</p>

  <p>The giant cat nailed itself to the ground with its claws, which created long and deep scratches on its way. It tried its best to slow down its descent.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>On the other side stood the Grandmaster of Heaven, whose tall figure closed in with a flash. He raised his palm and hacked down like a knife from the sky.</p>

  <p>In turn, the giant cat flipped and leaped into the air, then raised one paw to block the Grandmaster of Heaven's palm strike.</p>

  <p>Just as it managed to resist the incoming palm attack, a translucent white giant saber suddenly emerged from the Grandmaster of Heaven's body. The giant saber, which was also a weapon formed by a Treacherous Being, ruthlessly chopped down towards the giant cat.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Then, the saber cut the giant cat in half. After that one strike, it swung to the side and forcefully sliced the lower half of the cat's body.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit had transformed into the giant cat, and the cat-shaped Treacherous Being was hiding inside his body.</p>

  <p>Although the Grandmaster of Heaven had cut off the Eye Spirit's body with his saber, it was not enough to cut off the Treacherous Being inside him.</p>

  <p>Still, it managed to expose the Treacherous Being to the air.</p>

  <p>"Ewing! Now!" the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted.</p>

  <p>Ewing had been waiting for his command. As soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven gave the order, he swiftly leaped up into the air with two "lightning" bolts in his hands? which was the Light of Annihilation!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Without second thoughts, he immediately threw the lightning bolts down.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven's other hand became as red as a hot iron. As the two lightning bolts flew towards the Treacherous Being, he also slapped it with his palm.</p>

  <p>This cat-shaped Treacherous Being was a resentment-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>All Treacherous Beings feared the Light of Annihilation. When hostility-level Treacherous Beings came into contact with it, they would immediately die.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the resentment-level Treacherous Beings were more powerful. The Light of Annihilation only weakened them, so those who wanted to kill them had to use strong theurgies.</p>

  <p>When the lightning bolts were about to hit the Treacherous Being, a blue figure suddenly flew over from the distance. It turned out to be the Holy Wings Armor!</p>

  <p>The Holy Wings Armor flew at a remarkably fast speed and blocked all the lightning bolts in front of the cat-shaped Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation struck the Holy Wings Armor's chest but did not cause any damage at all.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's red palm also simultaneously slapped down, but the Holy Wings Armor turned around and slapped its palm against his as well.</p>

  <p>It appeared that the Holy Wings Armor had the upper hand as it forcefully catapulted the Grandmaster of Heaven into the sky.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven flipped in the air and swooped down again with a cold stare. Then, he used the giant white saber that was about seven times bigger than his body, which the Treacherous Being inside him had formed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he ruthlessly chopped down!</p>

  <p>Not only did his attack pack his immense power, but also the theurgy of the resentment-level Treacherous Being in his body!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In turn, the Holy Wings Armor's eyes lit up then it unleashed a massive amount of Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The saber formed by the Treacherous Being was virtually invincible, but the Light of Annihilation quickly softened and molded it to its will. The saber struggled like a tentacle in pain!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven realized how dangerous it became, so he turned around and retreated to the other side. However, he failed to completely withdraw the saber because it contained too much impact, and the Holy Wings Armor tightly gripped the saber's tip!</p>

  <p>After the Light of Annihilation shone on the resentment-level Treacherous Being, its body became very fragile.</p>

  <p>With a tug, the Holy Wings Armor tore the now fragile saber apart. Then, its hands released blue rays of light, which created strong currents that flowed onto the broken part of the saber.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>As a result, the damaged part of the saber dissipated.</p>

  <p>Since it was a part of the Treacherous Being inside the Grandmaster of Heaven, the Treacherous Being began to roll in agony inside his body due to the sharp pain.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he also suffered because of the Treacherous Being's violent struggle. His face flushed a deep purple, and he spat out a mouthful of blood then hastily retreated backward.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I'm really strong..." Gavyn laughed from inside the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Gavyn's voice, the Eye Spirit was stunned for a moment but he coldly commanded, "Go and chase him!"</p>

  <p>The Godly Way energy was still in the hands of the Grandmaster of Heaven. If he successfully took it away, it would be troublesome.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Eye Spirit had thought that the person inside the Holy Wings Armor was Slade, but it was Gavyn instead.</p>

  <p>For him, Gavyn was truly special among the members of the Element Spirit race. His talent and ability were on par with Claire's, but he was just too complacent.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Eye Spirit had imprisoned him in the Holy Wings Armor to become a part of Slade.</p>

  <p>Yet, he did not expect that after he sent Slade out, Gavyn had taken control of the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>Then again, they were in a critical moment where it was not the right time to hold Gavyn accountable. Thus, the Eye Spirit only suppressed his displeasure. He quickly repaired his body and also chased after the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of here!" the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted to Ewing, Phelps, and his other subordinates as he fled.</p>

  <p>It was not suitable to stay on the Treasure Bottle Platform any longer. The Grandmaster of Heaven had just planned to defeat the Eye Spirit once and for all, but he failed. Therefore, he fled without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Eye Spirit knew what he had thought about.</p>

  <p>He decided to hold on until the Black House and General Gianni had arrived. By that time, he could easily kill the enemies.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, heavily injuring his physical body was good enough. More importantly, he had to keep the Godly Way energy on the Treasure Bottle Platform.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven and his subordinates fled to the edge of the platform, an enormous wall of flames suddenly appeared in front of them and blocked their way.</p>
