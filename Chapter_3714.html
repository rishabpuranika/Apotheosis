<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Together with the other disciples of the third floor, Gabriel observed Zheng's Soul of Light with utmost curiosity.</p>

  <p>Considering Zheng's Soul of Light alone, it might seem there was nothing absolutely remarkable about him.</p>

  <p>After all, anyone who was able to enter the Soul City was obviously at the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. People like Gabriel and Carver had been staying at this level for a long time.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng and Feng Ge who had just made it to Stage Twenty-nine were still considered as novices here.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was a famous disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace. Almost everyone had heard of his name before.</p>

  <p>Among the disciples in the entire Land of Sword Grief, Libby had seen the most of the battle against the Sun Crow race. Back then, she was a novice in the Oneness Array.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Gabriel and Carver only had the option to join the twelve passes and become Oneness Generals.</p>

  <p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Nice to finally meet you!"</p>

  <p>Gabriel, Carver, and the other disciples of the third floor all came forward, cupped their hands and bowed slightly as they greeted Zheng. They all seemed too enthused.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng also bowed slightly to them. "This is the very first time that Feng Ge and I have entered the Soul City. Thus, we are very unfamiliar with this place. I hope you can lend us a hand," he said politely.</p>

  <p>"No problem! It is safe to say that with your strength, it won't be that difficult to pass the test of the Soul City," replied Gabriel with a reassuring smile.</p>

  <p>"Is that so? Well, that is quite flattering." Zheng humbly accepted the compliment with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, his soul pillar flashed and began to vibrate slightly while he was still speaking.</p>

  <p>Carver noticed this as well. So he said, "The soul pillars are about to ascend. Come, let's choose our own pillars!"</p>

  <p>There were lots of soul pillars all over the entire Soul City. Many of the ones located behind Zheng were not occupied. With a gentle leap, Carver, Gabriel, and the other disciples skillfully boarded the soul pillars and sat down cross legged.</p>

  <p>The number on Libby's soul pillar was seventeen. This meant that she had already come to the Soul City for the seventeenth time. Carver's number was one hundred and ninety-eight, while Gabriel's was two hundred and thirty. The two of them had been to the Soul City many times before.</p>

  <p>"With Zheng's strength, it'll be very easy for him to pass the test of the Soul City, right?" Carver whispered to Gabriel.</p>

  <p>Gabriel merely snorted at this. "As far as I know, he did not gain those great achievements in the battle against the Sun Crows because of his own strength. He only attained them because he received lots of help from some supreme masters!"</p>

  <p>Being disciples on the third floor of the Land of Sword Grief, Gabriel and Carver felt extremely proud of themselves. Libby was the only person they admired within the entire place.</p>

  <p>To be honest, they were quite uncomfortable with Zheng's arrival.</p>

  <p>Gabriel was the son of the Bright Mountain's leader. His father's death was a great blow to him. Needless to say, he did everything in his power to investigate what happened to his father. Therefore, he knew more about Zheng's deeds than ordinary people.</p>

  <p>"I see. It really was quite unthinkable that a man who didn't even pass the test of the Soul City could stand against the mighty warriors of the Sun Crow race. All of the people in the Oneness Sky Palace have even admired him as if he was a God. This will be too much for him," Carver said.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's his first time to sit on the soul pillar. Judging from the looks of it, he doesn't even know what kind of test he is going to face. It'll be fun watching him make a fool of himself later." Gabriel smirked mockingly.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, the soul pillars trembled once again. Slowly, they began to rise.</p>

  <p>The soul pillar that Zheng had sat on was rising as well. It gradually ascended by ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet...</p>

  <p>As soon as the soul pillars rose, a brown cloud started to press down from above the Soul City. The cloud seemed to contain a mix of countless souls and innumerable twisted faces that struggled and howled inside it.</p>

  <p>The soul cloud continued pressing down as the soul pillars went up. The soul pressure became more and more intense as Zheng continued to approach the cloud.</p>

  <p>"Could this be the test of the Soul City?" Zheng mumbled to himself with a frown.</p>

  <p>He wondered whether merely dealing with the soul pressure was enough to strengthen one's own Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>From the moment Zheng began to cultivate his soul, he had felt no change yet.</p>

  <p>Everyone's soul had reached a limit after reaching the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. Even if they absorbed more soul crystal, they still wouldn't be able to advance to a higher level.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng didn't believe that the test of the Soul City was to just deal with the soul pressure. There had to be a different trial hidden behind this.</p>

  <p>The soul pillars had now ascended to fifty feet.</p>

  <p>They rose to a hundred feet while the pressure kept rising.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that they were now nearing two hundred feet.</p>

  <p>As soon as the soul pillars reached two hundred feet, they stopped. The soul cloud above also stopped descending. It hovered just ten feet away from all of the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>At this close distance, Zheng could observe the soul cloud more clearly.</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of strange faces and some sharp tiny crystals swirling within the cloud. These tiny crystals were the ones that reflected colorful lights from the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>What were they supposed to do now? Were they going to enter the soul cloud?</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, they heard strange sounds coming from within the cloud just as Zheng was pondering about what their next move should be.</p>

  <p>At first, they sounded like unintelligible screams. However, they started to become even more peculiar now.</p>

  <p>After listening to them for a while, Zheng noticed something. The tones and pronunciation of the screams were becoming intensely rhythmic. Now, they sounded like a pleasant song!</p>

  <p>"Wait a second. It's a song?" Zheng gazed at the cloud intently. His face registered a look of astonishment.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, it gave him an utterly bizarre feeling. It felt like the cloud had taken the form of a young girl who was singing. However, this young girl didn't have a mouth so obviously, she wouldn't be able to sing.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she was using the mouths of the souls in the cloud. She created a song by gathering lots of different sounds together.</p>

  <p>At this point, the voice of the Primeval Lord of Heaven rang clearly once again. "Listen carefully, Zheng. This song contains the comprehension of the Colorless Soul."</p>

  <p>"The comprehension of the Colorless Soul is in the song?" Zheng repeated as he stared incredulously at the soul cloud. "What shall I do? I can't understand it at all." Zheng was evidently stunned.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at him and smiled. "Well, do you understand Sanskrit words?"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zheng couldn't understand Sanskrit words either. He didn't have the incredible ability to decipher the Sanskrit words instantly just like Geoffrey. If he truly wanted to decipher the Sanskrit words methodically, it would definitely take him a very long time.</p>

  <p>Coming out of his reverie, Zheng had a sudden realization. "Do you mean to say that this song..." His voice trailed away as he waited for the answer.</p>

  <p>"Yes, these are their voices." The Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed what Zheng had on his mind.</p>

  <p>It was well-known that Sanskrit words were incomprehensible within the chaos.</p>

  <p>If people really wanted to read and understand them, they had to decipher them first. However, this method was time-consuming.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Geoffrey had merely translated the Sanskrit words without even knowing how to read them.</p>

  <p>In actuality, Sanskrit words could be read. However, there wasn't a single person in the chaos who could read Sanskrit words instantly.</p>

  <p>"It turns out those Sanskrit words are read in such a strange and baffling way," Zheng mused. He tilted his head to the side and listened carefully.</p>

  <p>Based on his observation, there were times when the sounds were rising and falling in cadence and then suddenly becoming delicate and subtle. To him, they seemed like a poem or a song. They were like people scolding each other in the marketplace. They could only be understood mentally.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they could not be described by mere words.</p>

  <p>After listening closely for a while, Zheng smiled bitterly. "How will I be able to cultivate the Colorless Soul and reach the Holy Soul Realm with this? I can't quite make sense of these chaotic and irregular sounds."</p>
