<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>And since its establishment, the four great forbidden lands were declared as belonging to the Hall of Holy Beings. No True God was allowed to enter without the Hall of Holy Beings' permission!</p>

  <p>Prior to such an occurrence though, everyone was allowed to enter and exit any forbidden land across the divine land.</p>

  <p>This change caused everyone's dissatisfaction in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, even though they weren't happy with this decision, who would dare challenge the Holy Beings' authority?</p>

  <p>Originally, the Hall of Holy Beings only controlled the four great forbidden lands. However, as time went on, all kinds of forbidden lands of different sizes were placed under the Hall of Holy Beings' control.</p>

  <p>The forbidden lands in the divine land were divided from first to sixth grade, according to the degree of danger. The four great forbidden places were sixth grades, and they were equally considered to be the most dangerous places in the whole divine land. These four great forbidden places were respectively known as Soul Wilderness, Everest Spirit Mountain, Swirl Forest, and Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>So far, the rich clans on the Floating Islands had explored the four great forbidden lands countless times, but still to this day, they didn't have a complete understanding of them.</p>

  <p>While exploring the four great forbidden lands, it was even possible for a True God who had reached the consummate level of cultivation to die accidentally! The dangers here were not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>"Is the Swirl Forest also one of the four great forbidden lands?" Luo Zheng asked with wonder in his voice.</p>

  <p>Master Evil nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then how did you ever escape from that place?"</p>

  <p>Bromley's fairy palace was standing in the middle of Swirl Forest. Luo Zheng had a deep impression of the forest from back when the fairy palace's enchanted barrier had opened.</p>

  <p>"Holy Bromley's fairy palace isn't located in the deepest depths of the Swirl Forest. And honestly, we were just so lucky that day, so we managed to flee. It was almost a miracle." Speaking of such, Master Evil was still somewhat frightened from his experience. The beasts in the Swirl Forest had rushed to the fairy palace in a craze, but the beasts didn't get them into trouble.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, someone on the side of the square shouted out of nowhere,</p>

  <p>"Don't go to the Everest Spirit Mountain for the time being! The Jiang Clan's members and Harold are fighting with each other there. You'd better be careful!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows shot upward as these words reached his ears.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been looking for and asking about this kind of information ever since he had arrived in the Han Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors who cultivated in the Purple Soul Hall were women, in fact. Thus, they didn't really care about the situation happening over in the divine land and Luo Zheng could only obtain very little information. He hadn't expected to hear Harold's news as soon as he stepped foot inside the Han Clan's Holy Emperor City!</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Is Harold fighting with the Jiang Clan again?"</p>

  <p>"Does Harold control the Everest Spirit Mountain? With his strength alone, how does he dare cause trouble in the Jiang Clan again and again?</p>

  <p>I don't know what he wants to do to them..."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! If he has really annoyed the Holy Emperor of the Jiang Clan, then he'll surely die. After all, even Holy Mike is dying, so he has no one to help him out!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Harold has stayed in the Everest Spirit Mountain for so many years. If he really controls the Everest Spirit Mountain, even the Jiang Clan's Holy Emperor probably wouldn't do anything to punish him..."</p>

  <p>With his eyes blazing, Luo Zheng pushed through the bustling crowd and walked straight toward the man who had just spoke.</p>

  <p>The man, who had a cultivation base of a mid-rank True God, was wrapped in a strange veil, and looked rather kind.</p>

  <p>"Hey, friend. How's the fight going between Harold and the Jiang Clan?</p>

  <p>Can you tell me in detail?" Luo Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>The man originally took no notice of Luo Zheng. After he heard Zheng's words though, he glanced at him with a strange expression on his face. "A proving godly warrior? What are you even doing here?"</p>

  <p>The True Gods in this square would exchange information about the forbidden lands with each other, and at the same time, they would pick candidates they liked in order to have them explore the forbidden lands...</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, when proving godly warriors entered the Floating Island, they would wholeheartedly cultivate the Godly Way and had no time for travelling to the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter if I am a proving godly warrior or not. I just want to know more information about the matter you just mentioned," Luo Zheng said in a serious tone this time.</p>

  <p>He didn't care about Harold in the least. Although Harold was one of his father's disciples, he had never met Luo Zheng. What Luo Zheng cared about was that Yan, his sister, stayed with Harold!</p>

  <p>"Go away! You are just a proving godly warrior. You don't have the qualifications to know such information. Leave my presence and continue your cultivation!" The man waved his hand impatiently at Luo Zheng, trying to drive him away.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Little guy, you've got nothing more than an average cultivation base. Why do you want to hear these rumors so badly?"</p>

  <p>"Entering the Han Clan's Floating Island is not an easy task. What you should try doing now is improving your cultivation base."</p>

  <p>A few True Gods also mocked Luo Zheng. The appearance of a proving godly warrior had truly surprised them all.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng gently shook his hand, hundreds of divine might coins poured out from his palm. Luo Zheng stared at the mid-rank True God and stated in a serious and flat tone, "Tell me the matter of Harold and the Jiang Clan.</p>

  <p>Then, I will give you all these divine might coins."</p>
