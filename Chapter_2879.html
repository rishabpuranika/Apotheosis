<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Really? Did you actually encounter such a person?" the woman asked, her beautiful face registering her surprise.</p>

  <p>Ademar said, "It's not a big deal. The Sea of Truth is just the beginning. He can break through the first line most probably because he had stayed there for a long time. However, it is the first time that you entered the sea. If you had stayed in the Sea of Truth for longer, you would have been able to cross it without using a soul pill, as well."</p>

  <p>Dorothy blinked her eyes in wonder and commented, "But it's also his first time to enter the Sea of Truth!"</p>

  <p>"That's amazing, indeed." The beautiful woman, Felicity, nodded with a smile. "I wonder which clan he hails from, since he is even better than you."</p>

  <p>She did not expect Dorothy to shake her head and say, "That's not all. Have you heard the rumor from the Oneness Sky Palace, Aunt Felicity?"</p>

  <p>"What rumor?" Felicity asked.</p>

  <p>"About that man who swam in the Sea of Truth," the other replied.</p>

  <p>Felicity's eyes flashed, and she nodded, her expression becoming serious.</p>

  <p>According to the rumor from the Oneness Sky Palace, someone succeeded in swimming in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Outsiders knew nothing about it, but the rumor attracted considerable attention within such a small area.</p>

  <p>Many people were skeptical about the rumor.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful a Soul of Light was, it would completely disappear once it fell into the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Since the ancient times, no one had disproved this rule, or at least none that they knew of.</p>

  <p>However, the children of the Oneness Sky Palace were certain about what they saw. After all, many people had witnessed the scene.</p>

  <p>Some people reasoned out that a mirage in the Sea of Truth might have deceived the kids into thinking that it was a real person.</p>

  <p>But then, how could a mirage destroy a Truth Boat? The deduction didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, did you also see that person?" Felicity asked urgently.</p>

  <p>Beside her, Ademar had his mouth wide open in shock. "You mean the guy who has passed the first line is able to go straight into the sea? If his Soul of Light could really enter the Sea of Truth and not melt, doesn't that mean that he could do whatever he wants in the sea?"</p>

  <p>Souls of Light feared only a few things: cold air and the wind blowing on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Since this being wasn't even afraid of the Sea of Truth, then cold air and the sea breeze posed no threat to him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's him," Dorothy confirmed. "But the truth is a little different from the rumors. The one I have met was his Soul of Light."</p>

  <p>"His Soul of Light?"</p>

  <p>Felicity and Ademar were confused.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyes also showed her puzzlement. "Actually, he appeard to have two forms: one is the Soul of Light, which also needs to rely on the Truth Boat like me. In that form, it is difficult for him to resist the wind and the chill. Therefore, when he rushed to break through the first line, he faced tremendous pressure. Meanwhile, his other form can enter the Sea of Truth, not as a Soul of Light, but as a corporeal body."</p>

  <p>Zheng's forms would have been quite unimaginable for Dorothy if she hadn't seen them with her own eyes. She formed such hypotheses based on her intuition.</p>

  <p>Then she told them what she had seen on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Enter the Sea of Truth with his physical body?" Felicity's face showed her growing amazement and surprise. Her mind could not grasp what it meant to enter the Sea of Truth with one's physical body.</p>

  <p>Ademar said, "I'm afraid we have to report this to the palace leader."</p>

  <p>Just then, a wizened voice resounded from above the palace. "Dorothy has done an excellent job. It was believed that in the remote ages, warriors didn't rely on boats to cross the Sea of Truth. Those who reached the Other Shore using the Ancient God Cultivation Method didn't enter the sea with their souls, but with their corporeal bodies. Therefore, the ancient gods crossed the sea with their bodies instead of their Souls of Light. For some unknown reason, corporeal bodies couldn't enter the Sea of Truth starting at some point, and the ancient gods gradually declined. Eventually, the Grand World Cultivation Method appeared, and warriors began to cultivate Souls of Lights to cross the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>"Grandma!" Dorothy called out.</p>

  <p>An old woman with a hunched back slowly entered the palace gate.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Madam!"</p>

  <p>Felicity and Ademar offered their salutations to the old woman.</p>

  <p>The palace leader nodded and said, "If Dorothy didn't see it with her own eyes, I would not have believed that someone could even try to reach the Other Shore with a physical body."</p>

  <p>The palace leader had some knowledge of what had happened in the remote ages, but the real reason behind the failure of the warriors to reach the Other Shore using the Ancient God Cultivation Method was unknown to her.</p>

  <p>"Did that person reveal his identity?" the palace leader asked.</p>

  <p>Dorothy shook her head and said, "He is not of the Source World. He had no knowledge of the basics like soul pills or the Illusion Breaking Rune."</p>

  <p>Despite its mysterious nature, the Illusion Breaking Rune was a basic soul skill in the Source World that should be mastered by everyone before entering the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"He is not from the Source World?" The eyes of the palace leader narrowed.</p>

  <p>Small races and forces were scattered in the chaos outside the Source World. She would have to search within a broad area if she wanted to find where he came from.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He once asked about the war between the Nine Li and the Bear races, and he was very concerned about Chiyou's life and death," Dorothy recalled.</p>

  <p>"He cared about Chiyou's life and death? Is he a member of the Nine Li race?" Ademar blurted out.</p>

  <p>Felicity rolled her eyes and said, "It's hard to make a conclusion just based on that."</p>

  <p>The palace leader nodded in agreement. "Indeed, it is difficult to conclude anything with only this clue. If he really could enter the sea with his physical body, then Dorothy would gain a lot by following him. As for myself, I must go to the Floating Mountain to determine what it means to enter into the sea with one's physical body."</p>

  <p>Dorothy was the apple of the eye of the whole palace, so everyone was hoping that she could make it out of the Sea of Truth alive and safe.</p>

  <p>Dorothy tilted her head, lost in thought for a moment, and suddenly asked,</p>

  <p>"Grandma, do you have a truth theurgy of the Truth of Cultivation Nature?"</p>

  <p>"What do you need it for?" the palace leader inquired with some confusion.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had cultivated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent; naturally, she didn't need a truth theurgy of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>"That person is practicing the Truth of Cultivation Nature," Dorothy replied. "I noticed that he didn't know anything in the Source World. If, by any chance, he doesn't have a truth theurgy, then I want to supply him with one."</p>

  <p>The palace leader nodded slightly. "Although the warriors of our palace mainly cultivate the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, we still have several truth theurgies about other cultivation methods. I shall ask Ademar to bring one of them for you."</p>

  <p>Dorothy's guess was correct. What she asked for was indeed something that Zheng lacked.</p>

  <p>After the Nine Li race was eliminated from the divine land, virtually no truth theurgy was left. Even if some of them had been preserved, no one could cultivate them because of a precondition for its cultivation: a complete understanding of a Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Actually, the Non-combat Zone, which Harper created using his Truth of Goodwill and Malice, had been a truth theurgy, and Nicholas' Dark Light World Transformation was another truth theurgy.</p>

  <p>Back then, Nicholas had strived extremely hard to obtain this theurgy from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>After retreating from the Sea of Truth, Zheng heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>True, he was able to withstand the sea's pressure, but that kind of pressure would have stayed with him for as long as he was within the sea.</p>

  <p>Upon his retreat, the pressure bearing down on his Soul of Light totally dissipated, leaving him completely relaxed.</p>
