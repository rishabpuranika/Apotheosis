  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng tore the demonic life vitality, the disciples in the Seventeenth Court felt confused. Harrison too stared blankly, "Are you done with it so fast?"</p>

  <p>According to their knowledge about how to refine a weapon, the time would be either long or short, but Luo Luo Zheng finished it in such a short time, which was uncommon.</p>

  <p>Judging from this point, Harrison was sure that Luo Luo Zheng was just having fun!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng replied with a relieved smile, "Yes, I have finished refining the sword."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, please open the furnace so that we can have a look at the result."</p>

  <p>Harrison didn't harbour any ill intention but was simply curious about what Luo Luo Zheng wanted to do.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked to the weapon refining furnace. When he uncovered the furnace lid, a silver light suddenly reflected out from the furnace.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The sharp silver light was shinning brightly from the burner and dashed to the wall in the Seventeenth Court. One layer of the wall was cut by the light unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng stretched his hand into the furnace and took out the treasured sword, the silver light on the sword rushed to the sky. An invisible wave spread around the sword.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>For a second, all people at Quenching Peak found something unusual.</p>

  <p>On the side behind the Quenching Peak, the ground fire vein extending from the Hell Mountain converged here and formed a pool with a depth of three meters. However, there was no water but rolling magma in the pool, so it could very simply be called a fire pool.</p>

  <p>Around the fire pool sat two weapon refiners who summoned the body fire to mix with the magma in the fire pool.</p>

  <p>These two weapon refiners were the masters at Quenching Peak: Jerrison Yan and Merk Jiang. Both of them reached grade 7 of the nature level.</p>

  <p>They didn't have powerful strength but had great knowledge on refining weapons. Although they were a great distance from a grand master, it was more than enough to be a master at Quenching Peak.</p>

  <p>In order to make his fire purer, the weapon refiner would choose to contemplate the fire.</p>

  <p>There were many kinds of fire, and the magma from the underground was one of them, but the fire in it was extremely violent.</p>

  <p>After contemplation, they could increase their fire's power manifold, but their fire would thus become furious and hard to control.</p>

  <p>So when the two contemplated the fire pool, they would take a "chill pill" every thirty minutes which would make them have a chilly breath.</p>

  <p>In fact, the weapon refiners often chose the cultivation method with fire attribute, and the chilly stuff was a big taboo, but the chilly breath could spread all over the body and help them control the magma's fury to calm down.</p>

  <p>When they concentrated on contemplating the magma in the fire pool, suddenly a silver wave flew past them and quickly moved far away.</p>

  <p>Both of their expressions changed in an instant.</p>

  <p>"This wave... The refined weapon of someone is out of the furnace."</p>

  <p>Jerrison displayed a cautious expression on his face, but he was unwilling to speak out his judgement.</p>

  <p>However, Merk beside him expressed in advance, "This is an aftermath of a treasure coming out from the furnace."</p>

  <p>Generally, any weapon with a rank, even including the low-grade mysterious weapon would have the aftermath when it was pulled out of the furnace, only the aftermath was slight, difficult to perceive for ordinary people.</p>

  <p>While the wave made from the spiritual weapon was more visible. Even ordinary people could sense it, but it could not reach far away.</p>

  <p>The fire pool beside Jerrison and Merk was not far away from the Quenching Peak, but the aftermath of the spiritual weapon naturally couldn't spread all the way here.</p>

  <p>Only the fairy weapon could have such violent aftermath when it was pulled out of the furnace.</p>

  <p>The aftermath spread to the fire pool and farther away but didn't tend to stop. The two refiners couldn't judge this weapon's grade.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell can actually refine a fairy weapon at Quenching Peak?"</p>

  <p>Jerrison frowned and asked as his curiosity grew.</p>

  <p>"Was Enio refining a fairy weapon?" Merk thought for a long moment but couldn't figure it out, so he had to guess.</p>

  <p>Cloud Sect was not strong at weapon refining. There were nearly one million disciples in Cloud Sect, but only one thousand were willing to choose to cultivate weapon refining skills in Quenching Peak.</p>

  <p>Only one weapon refining grand master appeared in Cloud Sect over these years, and he was one of the three famous grand masters in Burning Sky Empire, Enio Qian.</p>

  <p>As soon as Merk expressed his thought, Jerrison disapproved, "No way.</p>

  <p>Why is Enio willing to refine weapons at Quenching Peak? He is a grand master!"</p>

  <p>The weapon refining furnaces used by the disciples at Quenching Peak couldn't attract Enio's observant and alert eyes. The Nine-rune Earthworm Furnace Cloud Sect arranged for Enio cost a lot of money. It was a treasure not inferior to a fairy weapon in the eyes of the weapon refiners.</p>

  <p id="top_7"><a id="p1634" class="calibre2"></a>Enio was used to the Nine-rune Earthworm Furnace. How did he agree to use the ordinary copper furnace at Quenching Peak?</p>

  <p>Merk replied, "I don't think it is possible, either. But Enio is the only one who can refine fairy weapons in Cloud Sect. How can anyone else even be able to refine a fairy weapon?"</p>

  <p>"Since we can't figure out. Why not just head to the spot and have a look for ourselves?" Afterwards, Jerrison stood up and headed to Quenching Peak, and Merk followed him closely behind. Although they were weapon refiners, they had the strength at grade 7 of the nature level, so they had high speed. With that said they arrived at Quenching Peak in an instant.</p>

  <p>In the Seventeenth Court, the treasured sword in Luo Zheng's hand had totally transformed, even though the treasured sword's shape hadn't changed.</p>

  <p>Before it was refined, it looked ordinary.</p>

  <p>However, the whole treasured sword was now full of weird silver lights currently. If someone stared carefully, there were some runes on the blade of the sword indistinctly.</p>

  <p>Harrison and the disciples in the Seventeenth Court were completely dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>They opened their eyes wide and blankly stared at the treasured sword in Luo Zheng's hand. They wanted to speak but were astonished and unable to say anything, so they just wore a dull expression.</p>
