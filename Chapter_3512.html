  <p>
</p>

  <p>The energy vortex swirled and constantly changed its shape in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>According to the information Luo Nian and the Shape-shifting Spirit had provided, the guard might be able to control the energy vortex freely through this way.</p>

  <p>Then again, that was only his guess. After all, he was in the iron house, so he couldn't see the outside world.</p>

  <p>The sight of Luo Zheng rubbing the energy vortex's phantom made Feng Ge a little curious. "Go to the door and see if those energy bands disperse," he ordered.</p>

  <p>In turn, Feng Ge nodded and went downstairs to the entrance of the iron house.</p>

  <p>When she looked out along the entryway, her face looked slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>The energy bands had besieged the iron house, but now the energy bands were far away.</p>

  <p>She immediately returned to the upper floor and told Luo Zheng, "Those energy bands are already far away."</p>

  <p>It looked like Luo Zheng had already guessed it, though. He pointed to the energy vortex in his hand and said, "The iron house is in this part of the energy vortex, and we're out of the vortex now."</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, can we step into the Desire World directly?" Feng Ge asked. However, Luo Zheng shook his head and replied, "Maybe we can't."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore seemed to be a complex multi-layer space.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Desire World and the Lust World might not be in the same space. On the other hand, the energy vortex played a role in connecting the two worlds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, anyone who wanted to enter the Desire World had to go through the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>"Then what should we do?" Feng Ge asked, her eyes blinking a few times.</p>

  <p>Despite her questions, Feng Ge was also clever enough to figure it out on her own.</p>

  <p>As she stayed with Luo Zheng, however, it seemed that she didn't think too much about it.</p>

  <p>"Since the energy vortex can be controlled, it's easy for us to go through it,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he reached out and grabbed the phantom of the energy vortex again. He gently fiddled with it, and then the energy vortex became elongated. Finally, he was able to expand the passageway in the middle.</p>

  <p>In Stage Fourteen, the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace saw that the energy vortex wriggled a few times before it returned to its original state, but the energy channel, which was already restored to its original state, was still twisting. This energy vortex stretched constantly and extended down to the Desire World. Furthermore, the small passage in the center was surprisingly wide and went down like a staircase.</p>

  <p>"What happened to the energy vortex?"</p>

  <p>"With such a large space, it's easy to pass through..."</p>

  <p>"Is it because of Princess Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>"It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>Many of the Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples were still dumbfounded as they watched the energy vortex change.</p>

  <p>They guessed that Feng Ge had found a big secret in the energy vortex, and controlled the entirety of it. This assumption, however, wasn't logical at all.</p>

  <p>Quite some time had passed, and the energy vortex still floated between Stage Thirteen and Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>History told that the origin of this powerful energy vortex was still unknown. A few people speculated that it was the foundation for the construction of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But to control a mass of pure energy? It was impossible.</p>

  <p>Among so many disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace, perhaps only Dorothy believed that such a thing was possible.</p>

  <p>After all, she and Luo Zheng had travelled on the Other Shore, and she had seen him do many seemingly impossible things.</p>

  <p>Yet, on a second thought, Dorothy guessed that Luo Zheng might have completed that thing along with Feng Ge. The idea suddenly made her displeased.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, what's wrong with you?" Chaim asked in curiosity.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he sensed the distressed emotions Dorothy's Soul of Light had released.</p>

  <p>Now, the sudden change in the energy vortex meant that there was a high chance of Luo Zheng and Feng Ge's survival. Dorothy should be happy about that, shouldn't she?</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Dorothy answered coldly.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Chaim was an experienced and wise man. When he thought about the past behaviors of the two women when they stayed with Luo Zheng, he was able to come up with an answer.</p>

  <p>These two outstanding women from the Taiyi Heaven Palace both had extraordinary backgrounds. It would be difficult for Luo Zheng to deal with them in the future...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the iron house, Feng Ge stood in front of the tank.</p>

  <p>The soul crystal in the tank swirled around and turned into a thin shiny thread, which was absorbed by her space ring.</p>

  <p>The tank contained a large quantity of soul crystal. All the soul crystal the Taiyi Heaven Palace had collected in Stage Four might not even reach one-third of the soul crystal in the tank.</p>

  <p>Although Feng Ge's and Luo Zheng's Souls of Light had turned into Indigo Souls, they would suffer more pressure in the Desire World, and there was a higher demand on their Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>There was always a lack of soul crystal, so Feng Ge would not leave even a little bit of it.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he searched around in the room.</p>

  <p>Next to the iron table were two cases, both unlocked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rudely opened one of them. The first case was empty and dark inside.</p>

  <p>He opened the other one, and saw a row of black jades displayed in it.</p>

  <p>He took out a piece of jade and placed it on his palm. Suddenly, an ice cold sensation spread throughout his being.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>The black jade exuded a unique aura, but it didn't contain the Other Shore Power. At that moment, he remembered No. 9527's words that he shouldn't underestimate those things that didn't contain the Other Shore Power, because they must have a special use.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was very interested in them.</p>

  <p>"This is the Body-strengthening Jade," the Green Jade Spirit quickly replied.</p>

  <p>"Body-strengthening Jade? What's it used for?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It is used for body refining, similar to the soul crystal. It can be used to strengthen the body after it is refined, but..." The Green Jade Spirit thought for a second, and then continued, "This might be useless to you."</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, one could also cultivate themselves when their physical body had entered the Other Shore. Aside from cultivating slowly in the stages, there were also some shortcuts. One of them was to use the Body-strengthening Jade to refine the body, which could quickly strengthen the body.</p>

  <p>It was also the good way for the cultivation of the Wild Gods!</p>

  <p>In the past, the warriors didn't need any Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>It was still a pity that the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was prohibited, and even the Body-strengthening Jade became rare. Many super forces sold them at cheap prices, after they discovered some Body-strengthening Jades.</p>

  <p>Now, the value of the Body-strengthening Jade was naturally much less than that of the soul crystal. "Since it can strengthen the body, why is it useless to me?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The foundation for you to enter the Other Shore is not the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. You don't need to use it, but you can try," the Green Jade Spirit proposed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had entered the Other Shore through the unique Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Even his physical body was no longer his body in its true sense, but rather a completely supernormal one that was created through body refining.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Green Jade Spirit was certain that the Body-strengthening Jade wouldn't be useful to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether he could use the thing or not, Luo Zheng took all the Body-strengthening Jades from the bottom of the iron case and placed them into Feng Ge's space ring.</p>

  <p>Then, he rummaged around the iron house once more. Before he was about to leave, his eyes fell on the metal token embedded in the iron table.</p>

  <p>Without too much hesitation, he reached out to light up the Sanskrit words around the token one by one, and then took the token out.</p>
