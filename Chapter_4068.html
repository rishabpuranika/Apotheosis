<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sitting cross-legged underneath the enormous golden bell, Tianming slowly opened his eyes. Little by little, he began to take his surroundings in.</p>

  <p>A huge plaza was built around the bell. It was obvious that this bell held great importance. dozens of people lined up on its right side. All of them were patiently waiting for their turn.</p>

  <p>Some of the people standing in line were consummate True Gods. They were hoping to enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower by ringing the bell.</p>

  <p>Others were warriors at the Other Shore Realm who wanted to reach higher floors in the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>For these talented individuals of the divine land, accidentally falling into the Ruin Graveyard was actually a great opportunity for them.</p>

  <p>Long time ago, the numbers of the powerful clans above the Time Sea and the Holy Beings in the divine land were fixed. No matter what, they remained unchangeable.</p>

  <p>Unless they eliminated other powerful clans above the Time Sea, they would only remain as consummate True Gods their entire lives.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Luo Clan took control of the divine land, their chances became even slimmer than before.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there were Truths of Godly Ways for them to cultivate as well as places to assist them in their cultivation in the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they would have a good chance of reaching the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, all of the Other Shore Tokens obtained in the Mysterious Yellow Tower should be shown to everyone present.</p>

  <p>As soon as everyone saw Tianming regain consciousness, their eyes were instantly filled with anticipation and excitement. They couldn't wait to see what Other Shore Token he got. He promptly stood up and stepped aside.</p>

  <p>"Hey Tianming! What did you get? Was it a good one?" the young man standing beside him asked. He couldn't quite contain his curiosity anymore.</p>

  <p>This man was none other than Hallet.</p>

  <p>Hallet was able to obtain an Other Shore Token from the fifteenth floor.</p>

  <p>Even though he was not as outstanding as Tianming, he was still considered as one of the best.</p>

  <p>"Did you manage to get the Whirlwind Wings?" another young man piped as he looked at Tianming over Hallet's shoulder.</p>

  <p>His name was Augustus. He had a much better luck and talent compared to Hallet's. He was able to acquire an Other Shore Token from the nineteenth floor. Among all of the Other Shore Realm warriors in the divine land, he could easily be ranked as one of the top three.</p>

  <p>Tianming took out the Other Shore Token he got. "It's the Monta Stone," he announced.</p>

  <p>When everyone saw the gray stone, the whole place was immediately filled with commotion.</p>

  <p>This stone was actually one of the best Other Shore Tokens that could be obtained from the thirty-first floor. However, Tianming did not find it suitable.</p>

  <p>He was hoping to get a different one.</p>

  <p>"But why the Monta Stone?" Hallet asked with unabated curiosity.</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't manage to get the Whirlwind Wings or the Sacred Battle Sword, he should not have chosen the Monta Stone. It didn't suit him at all.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Tianming was also puzzled by this. "When I got there, I wanted to take the Whirlwind Wings. However, they disappeared."</p>

  <p>"What? They disappeared? Why?" Augustus looked thoroughly baffled as well.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. I heard that such things have happened before as well," Hallet responded. His child-like face bore an expression of utter incredulity and amazement. "The Mysterious Yellow Tower was guiding you. If it didn't want you to take the Whirlwind Wings or Sacred Battle Sword, it means that the Monta Stone might be the one you need the most. This might be more essential for you than the two Other Shore Tokens."</p>

  <p>All of the people in the Ruin Graveyard didn't know much about the Mysterious Yellow Tower. All they knew was something peculiar and mystifying would happen in the tower from time to time.</p>

  <p>The tower guiding some people to take the Other Shore Tokens befitting them was one of those mysterious happenings.</p>

  <p>"But the function of this stone doesn't match my needs." Tianming frowned at the stone in his hand.</p>

  <p>When he heard this, Hallet smiled. He said, "Well, you just have to believe that the Mysterious Yellow Tower knows you better than you do. In addition to that, we barely have any ideas about the Other Shore Tokens found on the top floors of the tower. Therefore, we can only speculate about their functions. Perhaps, this stone is not a strengthening-type Other Shore Token."</p>

  <p>It was a bit difficult to confirm the ability of an Other Shore Token. It could only be verified after it had been borne and used by its owner.</p>

  <p>Only a few number of people were able to bear the Other Shore Tokens on the thirty-first floor. Therefore, their initial assessment was merely a speculation.</p>

  <p>"In any case, the guidance of the Mysterious Yellow Tower always has good results. You have to trust its judgment," Augustus added.</p>

  <p>In the past, Augustus had very little interest in cultivation. But ever since he was able to reach the Other Shore Realm, he had a change of heart. He cultivated hard, which resulted in his extremely fast progress.</p>

  <p>Tianming was a little disappointed and downcast. But when he heard what they said, he began to feel better. Soon enough, he was extremely excited to try his Other Shore Token out. He was curious to see what kind of magic this Monta Stone had.</p>

  <p>"I sure hope you are right. We'll just have to see for ourselves." Tianming clapped his hands on their shoulders.</p>

  <p>Dong! The sound echoed throughout the entire place.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, the gigantic golden bell in the center of the square rang once again.</p>

  <p>The person who rang the bell was at the fifth stage of the Other Shore Realm. The ringing only lasted for about thirty seconds.</p>

  <p>As the man opened his eyes, he showed the Other Shore Token he was able to obtain and promptly left from the queue.</p>

  <p>"Good! It's my turn!"</p>

  <p>Augustus exclaimed excitedly and confidently as he walked towards the big bell.</p>

  <p>"You seem very confident, Augustus," Tianming said with a smile.</p>

  <p>With this, Hallet sighed and shook his head. "He has gained quite a lot in the Water Drop Cave. He is actually planning to ring the bell two times in a row this time." He finished his sentence with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>"Two times in a row? Unbelievable!" Tianming was dumbfounded. He didn't know Augustus was that advanced in his cultivation.</p>

  <p>The other people waiting in line were filled with shock and envy. They wished they were able to do that as well.</p>

  <p>There was a simple answer to this: the Water Drop Cave.</p>

  <p>It was a magical cultivation place.</p>

  <p>This stone cave was quite massive.</p>

  <p>It was very cold and wet. Moreover, it branched out to hundreds of other caves located deep inside it. Each one was different in size and shape.</p>

  <p>All year round, there was water dripping from these caves. It was thoroughly clean and crystal clear. In fact, the droplets contained a unique aura that could greatly speed up the comprehension of the Truths of Godly Ways. This was its primary application.</p>

  <p>There were numerous places found in the Ruin Graveyard where one could comprehend the Truths of Godly Ways. Examples of these were the Sword Graveyard and the Gate of Nature. Each place corresponded to a specific Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, the Water Drop Cave didn't have the requirement for a particular Truth of Godly Way. Its effect was actually quite ordinary. Therefore, it was not as popular as the ones mentioned before.</p>

  <p>The only time people considered going to the Water Drop Cave was whenever the Sword Graveyard, the Gate of Nature, and others were full. In short, people went here only as a last resort.</p>

  <p>Later on, the divine land had been merged with the Ruin Graveyard. Soon after, there were changes that took place in the Water Drop Cave. The once clean and crystal clear water dripping from the caves became turbid.</p>

  <p>Warriors had to compete for the resources in the Ruin Graveyard as well.</p>

  <p>As a recently allied group, it was difficult for the ones from the divine land to gain access to the popular cultivation places. Therefore, the once unpopular Water Drop Cave was their best choice.</p>

  <p>The first ones to enter and utilize the Water Drop Cave was Tianming, Augustus, Hallet, Estelle, and the other consummate True Gods. They thought it was good that they still found a place for themselves in this new territory.</p>

  <p>One by one they tested the effects of cultivating in this cave. As the turbid water poured onto them, their bodies began to expand in just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard did not have the Chaotic Source World or Land of Bone Tribulation. Hence, they couldn't find a solution to the problem regarding cultivation of physical strength. This became a problem for Bromley after he reached the Other Shore Realm. It became harder for him to improve his cultivation. His physical body was unable to match the corresponding Other Shore Token. Eventually, it became a burden to him.</p>

  <p>The change in the Water Drop Cave caused a commotion in the entire Ruin Graveyard. Everyone wanted to try cultivating there.</p>

  <p>During that time, fights even broke out in the Ruin Graveyard. People began challenging each other to determine who would be allowed to occupy positions in the Water Drop Cave.</p>

  <p>On behalf of the human race, Bromley had reserved a considerable number of seats for the people of the divine land.</p>

  <p>In just a short period of time, both the human and non-human races in the divine land were able to produce a group of strong warriors. Soon enough, they reached the Other Shore Realm. All of them owed it to the change in the Water Drop Cave.</p>

  <p>However, the Holy Beings of the divine land were unable to make much progress.</p>

  <p>Even though they also cultivated in the Water Drop Cave, their improvement was quite slow. They were quite baffled by it because they were highly talented individuals.</p>

  <p>It was absolutely unusual that no matter how hard they tried, their cultivation speed was utterly slower than those of the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Aside from Bromley, the Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan, Jeremiah, and Joy, the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan, were the fastest ones to improve their cultivation. In a short span of time, they had already managed to reach the fourteenth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mike, Zeke, Clark, Holy Jay, and other Holy Emperors had only reached the seventh or eighth floor.</p>

  <p>If they were on the real Other Shore, they would not even be able to leave the Lust World. They had to spend more time working on their physical strength.</p>
