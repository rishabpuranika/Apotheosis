  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nobody had ever considered the possibility of Luo Luo Zheng defeating Lucille.</p>

  <p>Sure, the fight between the two was heart-thumping but they never thought that this young man would actually succeed in killing the powerful young miss.</p>

  <p>Whispers began to circulate through the crowd. Just who exactly was this young man? Where did he come from? Who was his teacher?</p>

  <p>They were all itching to find out.</p>

  <p>"Lucille is here!" someone declared.</p>

  <p>Many of them turned their heads to look. Lucille had indeed been revived and was slowly walking towards the top of the city wall.</p>

  <p>"She didn't leave the city immediately after she was revived. She went up the wall instead!"</p>

  <p>"She doesn't want to challenge that guy again?"</p>

  <p>"Does that mean she's accepting her defeat?"</p>

  <p>They all thought Lucille would hurry back and challenge Luo Luo Zheng to a rematch the moment she was revived. They never saw her as someone who gave up easily. It seemed they were wrong.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng remained perched on top of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, as if waiting for his opponent.</p>

  <p>There was a high chance of heavy conflict between the two of them.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect that she would choose to climb up the city wall instead.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked down at her from his place on top of the mountain with a smile. "Don't you want a rematch?"</p>

  <p>Lucille shook her head. "No, I don't," she replied firmly.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't out of cowardice. The goal for the Illusion Battlefield's first phase was to accumulate as many Illusion Points as possible. She couldn't do that if she ended up losing to Luo Luo Zheng again and again. Lucille was stubborn but she wasn't someone who fought battles that she wasn't confident she'd win.</p>

  <p>"We'll have a chance to fight each other again sooner or later," she told him. "When that time comes? I hope you're ready."</p>

  <p>Lucille gave Luo Luo Zheng a knowing smile. When the time came for them to meet on the battlefield once again, she would've already fused with Lucy. By then, there was no way she would lose!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shrugged. "Sure!" he said before rubbing the back of his head. "I have a question though."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why was it that the blue-clothed warrior's Illusion Points were absorbed by you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He already asked her this before but Lucille chose not to answer. He brought it up again only because he was really curious about this matter and still couldn't figure out how she did it. No matter how strong she was, there was no way Lucille could bend the Illusion Battlefield's rules.</p>

  <p>The young girl gave him a knowing smile before holding out a golden pellet in her hand. "This golden pellet is fused with my mark. Those martial artists who have been killed by the golden pellet are actually killed by me. When Ethan died, he crushed his pellet, which is equivalent to me killing him. Therefore, I was able to absorb his Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>This quickly cleared things up for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He never would've thought the answer to such a complicated problem was actually so simple.</p>

  <p>It is true that the more superficial the rules, the more difficult it is to understand them.</p>

  <p>However, her method gave Luo Luo Zheng a new perspective.</p>

  <p>So if a warrior set up multiple traps fused with his or her own mark, then the Illusion Points of those who ended up getting killed by these said traps would technically belong to the warrior who set it all up. This method meant that a warrior could stay inside the city and just wait for the Illusion Points to come to him or her.</p>

  <p>It was perfectly legal in terms of the Illusion Battlefield's rules. In fact, it was actually practiced by quite a few number of warriors, Layla being one of them.</p>

  <p>Her rank was rising rapidly lately.</p>

  <p>And it was thanks to this method.</p>

  <p>What Layla did was to wander around the Illusion Battlefield and find the main cities. She didn't look for them to challenge strong opponents, which would be too much of a risk.</p>

  <p>She didn't want to lose half of her points nor did she want to spend too much time struggling against a strong opponent. She wanted to fight smart, not fight hard.</p>

  <p>So she devised a method that could help her gain points without exerting too much effort.</p>

  <p>Whenever she arrived at a new city, Layla would scatter a large number of seeds. These weren't ordinary seeds at all. Once scattered on the ground, they would entrench themselves deep into the soil, almost as if they were living insects instead of plants.</p>

  <p>Germination only took two hours and these seeds of hers looked like dandelion stalks when grown.</p>

  <p>The blooms were the size of a fist and were extremely beautiful with the way they sparkled in the light.</p>

  <p>Of course, beautiful things were often also deadly.</p>

  <p>If a warrior approached any of these seemingly harmless dandelions, the transparent, needle-like bulbs would quickly burst and scatter to enter into the warrior's body.</p>

  <p>These tiny needles would flow through a warrior's meridians to track his or her life vitality. They would make their way into the elixir field and enter the inner world. Once in, the needles would release a deadly poison that polluted a warrior's entire life vitality sea.</p>

  <p>The next time the warrior exerted his or her life vitality, the warrior would die within seconds.</p>

  <p>Layla sprinkled these seeds one city after another and continued her wandering across the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>And the Illusion Points simply came to her wherever she went.</p>

  <p>The points she got from each victim weren't impressive but it was the sheer quantity of people that fell for her traps that made up for it.</p>

  <p>In less than two hours, she would usually accumulate quite a hefty amount of Illusion Points in her body and all without having to physically fight someone for it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "I understand," he said before jumping down from the Magnetic Secret Mountain. With a flick of his hand, the giant mountain spun around and shrunk back into the miniature size it was before.</p>

  <p>Lucille felt a slight twinge in her heart upon seeing the Magnetic Sacred Mountain shrink in Luo Zheng's palm. She had initially wanted to use Luo Zheng's life as a bargaining chip to force him to hand over the method of refining a Magnetic Sacred Mountain. Of course, that was when she thought she could defeat him and offer to spare his life. Now, the plan just seemed childish to her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gave Lucille one last look before turning to fly away.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield was a big place but it was fortunate that Luo Luo Zheng had the Teleportation Token with him to go to places more easily.</p>

  <p>Here, the primary method of accumulating points was to go to the various main cities and seek out the "fat sheep."</p>

  <p>Lucille was an example of this so-called "fat-sheep" and was, in fact, the fattest sheep of this city.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had already snatched half of her Illusion Points, he had no reason to stay. He needed to go to the next main city and gain more points from more sheep.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to leave, Lucille pursed her lips and finally opened her mouth, "Wait! Wait!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stopped and turned to look at her with a raised eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"I can make a deal with you!" she said through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>She couldn't let him go that easily. The method of refining a Magnetic Sacred Mountain was too important to pass up. She needed to learn it for her cultivation of the five elements.</p>

  <p>"What kind of deal?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of emotion that appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he followed the slight movement of her thin lips.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, he found himself in front of a house at the corner of the main city.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed as he looked at the quaint house and felt a certain sense of serenity from it. He couldn't help but feel a bit jealous of Lucille who spent her days idling by in this house but still ended up accumulating so many Illusion Points to herself. While, Luo Luo Zheng was out there fighting against anything and anyone but the amount he earned was actually less than a tenth of her Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Inside, Lucille stood in the middle of the courtyard, holding a row of blank jade slips in her hands.</p>

  <p>With a delicate voice, she uttered the word, "seal" and held the jade slip up to Luo Luo Zheng. "I will teach you how to refine the magnetic power in the Magnetic Sacred Mountain through this jade slip but that's it. How you use it will depend entirely on your own comprehension!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in understanding and made a move to take the jade slip from Lucille.</p>

  <p>However, a trace of hesitation appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>'What if I give this to him but he refuses to teach me his method of refining a Magnetic Sacred Mountain?'</p>
