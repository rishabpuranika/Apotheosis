</p>

  <p>"The Nine Li race really has been defeated..."</p>

  <p>All of the exiles had a sad expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>"If we've been defeated by the Yellow Emperor, where's the Grand Chieftain? And the eighty-one mages, and the many Nine Li Guards?"</p>

  <p>The eldest man stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "I don't know. I only know that this ship carries the hope of the Nine Li race and that there are a lot of Nine Li members.</p>

  <p>This is a ship for escape."</p>

  <p>"How could this happen?"</p>

  <p>"It's impossible that the Nine Li race was defeated by the Yellow Emperor!"</p>

  <p>"Brother, I want to go out and kill all the Yellow Emperor members!"</p>

  <p>One shouted in anger.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the members of the Yellow Emperor race in this world who caused the destruction of the Nine Li race. The people in this world were only exiles cursed by the Chaos Ancient God. It was just that they were shocked by the news and couldn't suppress their anger.</p>

  <p>"Don't be impulsive." The old man took a deep breath to calm himself.</p>

  <p>"Since it's the Grand Chieftain that created the ship, why is it falling?"</p>

  <p>"Because this ship was hunted down by the Yellow Emperor Guards,"</p>

  <p>Zheng spoke softly. "The Nine Li members on the ship have all almost been cleanly killed off."</p>

  <p>Since they were so angry, Zheng didn't plan to tell them at first but because they asked, he could only tell them the truth.</p>

  <p>"Yellow Emperor Guards!" Even though he was calm earlier, the old man was once again agitated. "It's my fault that I didn't wipe out those Yellow Emperor Guards back then! I only ended about a hundred Yellow Emperor Guards..."</p>

  <p>A hundred Yellow Emperor Guards?</p>

  <p>The words shocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know the number of Yellow Emperor Guards. There was a time that his mother mentioned that there were over a hundred thousand Nine Li Guards in the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor Guards should be about the same. This old man alone was able to kill over a hundred Yellow Emperor Guards. How strong was he?</p>

  <p>"After the Nine Li people were slaughtered, the divine land was gradually occupied by the human race, and then..."</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng didn't want to say anything. Since Zheng had decided to trust these exiles, he would tell them everything.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng finished, everyone remained silent.</p>

  <p>It was silent until Ramzi asked, "So you were the one who changed the ship's direction?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Ramzi turned to the old man. "What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the old man for guidance, he was the strongest of all the exiles as well as the strongest in the Nine Li race in this world.</p>

  <p>Even in the Source World, he wasn't someone that could be ignored.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, they had desperately hoped that the ship would fall off so that they could get a share of the ship, but now, they were worried about the ship's fate.</p>

  <p>But the old man stared at Zheng, his eyes filled with hesitation. In the end, he heaved a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>The wrinkles on his face deepened and he looked much older in an instant.</p>

  <p>"I'm old and it's fine for me to sacrifice my life for the Nine Li race, but... One can only enter this world and there's no way to get out. What can I do?" the old man sighed.</p>

  <p>As long as there was a tiny bit of news coming from the Source World, the exiles would be very excited.</p>

  <p>It had been many years since the last exile came and they had completely lost their means to learn about the Source World.</p>

  <p>Even if they had no information, they were always worried about the safety of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The news Zheng brought made them desperate but Zheng, who was in front of them, let them see the chance to do something for the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The problem was that this world was a huge prison... What could they do when they were trapped here?</p>

  <p>The old man's words made their eyes dim even further.</p>

  <p>"However, we have to let the Snake Goddess race release the ship and let it leave," Ramzi suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"That's right! No matter how strong Snake Goddess race are, there's no way they could have their hands on the ship!" another exile resolutely spoke up.</p>

  <p>In this world, the Snake Goddess race had absolute command.</p>

  <p>Not only were they naturally powerful because of their bloodline, they also had a few extremely formidable exiles. They naturally dominated the world.</p>

  <p>The old man interrupted them, "Have you thought of what Zheng has in mind?"</p>

  <p>Zheng must have come up with his own ideas.</p>

  <p>The group of excited exiles stared at Zheng again. It was time for him to make a decision.</p>

  <p>Zheng swept his gaze through the crowd for a quiet moment before he faintly began to speak. "My mother had no choice but to send me out.</p>

  <p>When I first came to this world, I had only one thought and that was to become stronger and then... I will go back to kill them! I won't fight my way only to the divine land but all the way to the Source World too."</p>

  <p>As soon as these words came out of his mouth, a hint of smile appeared on the exiles' faces.</p>

  <p>It was arrogant for Zheng to boast about his goals with his current strength, but he was a member of the Nine Li race and the grandson of Chiyou. If he didn't even have the guts to think like this, then their race would really be hopeless.</p>

  <p>"With your bloodline, it won't be difficult for you to become strong in this world! But I'm afraid it's still impossible to return and kill them all.</p>

  <p>No one can leave here."</p>

  <p>The majority of these exiles were powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm. How could they be willingly trapped in this world?</p>

  <p>They tried almost every way and still, no one managed to leave the world. This was a one way world, one could only enter and there was no way for them to leave.</p>

  <p>The old man had planned to say that Lorena shouldn't have sent Zheng here. But on second thought, Lorena was the daughter of the Grand Chieftain, and he was in no place to blame her. Moreover, she had no other choice because she sent Zheng here to save his life.</p>

  <p>Other exiles also looked depressed.</p>

  <p>At this moment, with just a blink of an eye, Zheng used chaotic energy to send a voice message to the exiles' ears, "What if... I know how to get back?"</p>

  <p>It puzzled Ramzi, the old man, Leopold and a few others why Zheng had to be so secretive in giving his message.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" the old man asked back secretly.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard of the Warden race?"</p>

  <p>Zelda had once told Zheng that the Warden race were searching for her and her brother all over the world.</p>

  <p>Since this Warden race ruled this prison, it was likely they had spies everywhere. Because he had just entered the Nine Li race and was unfamiliar with the situation, he had to be careful or it would be troublesome if there were people from the Warden race present.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng mention the Warden race, the exiles looked at each other again. "You've just entered this world. Why do you know the Warden race?" the old man asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>Very few people in this world knew the existence of the Light of Adjudication and the people who knew the mysterious Warden race were even rarer.</p>

  <p>It hadn't even been a year since he came in this world and he had spent most of it in the wilderness outside the bone towers, so how could he know these things?</p>
