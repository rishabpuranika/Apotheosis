<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Felicity felt anger welling inside her.</p>

  <p>Seeing what was happening, Winchell felt a little embarrassed. In a low voice, he hissed at her. "Felicity!"</p>

  <p>Despite Winchell scolding her, Felicity just snorted, "Outsiders are not welcome here."</p>

  <p>With an embarrassed look on his face, Zheng walked up to Felicity to try to reason with her. "Aunt Felicity, I'm sorry. I didn't know that something happened to Dorothy. So please, let me see her first, okay?"</p>

  <p>Zheng said sincerely.</p>

  <p>He and Dorothy had been through a lot together. Dorothy had accompanied him from the Sea of Truth all the way to Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she had saved his life before.</p>

  <p>After glaring at Zheng for a while, Felicity finally stood up. With a gloomy expression, she begrudgingly gestured for Zheng to follow her.</p>

  <p>Then, she led Zheng into the palace.</p>

  <p>The palace was not too big. After passing through a hallway, they arrived at the inner hall already.</p>

  <p>Upon entering the hall, Zheng's eyes fell on Dorothy, who was at the center of the hall. He gasped in shock once he saw her.</p>

  <p>On the surface of her body were tiny lines, which flashed with luster. It was as though beneath her chapped skin were glowing gems.</p>

  <p>The lines emitted faint red light, but the energy condensed within the red light was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Zheng was now a powerful warrior in the twenty-ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm. He had three Civilization Artifacts under control and had seen extremely powerful forces. However, almost none of the forces he had ever seen was comparable to what he was seeing now in Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"The energy in her body is so powerful..." Zheng whispered. He was absolutely floored.</p>

  <p>Standing behind him, Winchell said, "Once the energy bursts out, it'll be enough to raze the entire Bloom Divine Province."</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat. "It's that powerful?!"</p>

  <p>"And the energy in her body continues to increase every day," Felicity added.</p>

  <p>Ever since Yasamin got trapped on the Other Shore, Dorothy had fallen into a depression.</p>

  <p>She no longer went to the Land of Sword Grief, but spent all her time by Yasamin's side.</p>

  <p>Felicity recalled there was a time she came to visit Dorothy, but Dorothy was busy thinking about how to save her grandmother.</p>

  <p>Back then, Felicity thought that Dorothy was just wishfully thinking.</p>

  <p>After all, Dorothy was not able to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation, let alone become an Eternal Warrior. There was no way she could rescue Yasamin!</p>

  <p>To Felicity's surprise, however, Dorothy had resigned herself to meditation since that day. Till now, she hadn't woken up yet.</p>

  <p>But during this period of meditation, Dorothy's aura grew more and more powerful with each day that passed. Simultaneously, her skin cracked little by little each day, revealing more lines.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The shadow of the Primeval Lord of Heaven once again appeared above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Winchell felt a glimmer of hope. The reason why he had lured Zheng here in the first place was because he had wanted the Primeval Lord of Heaven to take a look at Dorothy.</p>

  <p>If even the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't figure out the reason behind what was going on, then perhaps no one in the world could.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, why are these lines appearing on the surface of Dorothy's body?" Zheng asked the question on everyone's minds.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven observed Dorothy carefully for a while.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be many divine megatons of force in her body. Has she made use of any Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, if anyone wanted to possess power as great as the energy emanating from Dorothy, they needed to have an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>It was already very difficult to possess one divine megaton of force with means from the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Since she's been on the Other Shore, I doubt she has used any Other Shore Token." Winchell frowned.</p>

  <p>The only possibility was that Dorothy had released some kind of Other Shore Token before she had entered the Other Shore, but it was highly unlikely.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven contemplated in silence. It seemed, even he couldn't understand the scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>Even though he was extremely knowledgeable, he was not omniscient.</p>

  <p>There were many unsolved mysteries about the Source World and even the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Did anything suspicious happen previously?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>Winchell shook his head. "She entered the Other Shore Realm together with Zheng. She is an outstanding talent among the members of the Origin Mountain. However, other than that, there's nothing special about her."</p>

  <p>As Winchell spoke, Felicity gave him a hesitant look.</p>

  <p>She didn't believe that there was nothing special about Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Dorothy thought she was the biological granddaughter of Yasamin.</p>

  <p>However, this was not the case.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's bloodline had been inherited from Yasamin through a special way. When she was young, she had taken Yasamin's unique Blood Upgrading Pill, so that her bloodline had been enhanced to a very high level.</p>

  <p>So technically, Dorothy was just an adopted granddaughter of Yasamin.</p>

  <p>Yet, Yasamin seemed to have grown fond of her. Having been with each other for many years, Yasamin and Dorothy had a strong bond. But there must have been a deeper reason as to why Yasamin decided to adopt Dorothy.</p>

  <p>But alas, no one else knew what the hidden reason was.</p>

  <p>Just as the Primeval Lord of Heaven studied Dorothy's body, Zheng suddenly clapped his hands as though he remembered something important. "I've once seen a closed door in the depths of her soul. That was in Stage One of the Other Shore. Is it possible that was an Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>At the time, Zheng had been confused as to why such a door was hidden in the depth of Dorothy's soul. Despite his initial confusion, he had never given it any further thought.</p>

  <p>Now that he thought about Dorothy carefully, he suddenly remembered how an Other Shore Token could be fused with one's soul.</p>

  <p>But at that time, they had just entered the Other Shore Realm. It was unlikely she had a chance to carry any token.</p>

  <p>"A door? What kind of door was it?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng closed his eyes and searched through the Memory Flame. Then, he plucked an ink brush and a scroll of paper out from thin air, and began to wave his hand.</p>

  <p>When one's soul was strong enough, it was easy to navigate through the memories within the Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As the ink brush danced over the paper, it started to draw very vividly a door with a strange shape.</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw the door, his face suddenly changed color. "Zheng, are you sure this is what you saw?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Zheng firmly.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't conceal his shock. "This is the door to another world, and also the most dangerous door in all the thirty-three stages of the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>"The most dangerous door?"</p>

  <p>Zheng echoed in a daze. The corner of his mouth twitched. He was so anxious that he didn't even take notice of the first part of the sentence— It was the door to another world.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had no idea what would happen if she opened this door.</p>

  <p>She had never tried opening it, since Yasamin had warned her not to. She was always obedient to her grandmother, and trusted every word she said.</p>

  <p>However, now that Yasamin was on the verge of death, Dorothy saw that she had no other option.</p>

  <p>As soon as she entered the Other Shore, she headed straight for the door without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>She was keenly aware that monsters were on the other side of that door.</p>

  <p>This she knew because more than once she had seen eerie, slender arms and demonic scarlet eyes from the hole on the door.</p>

  <p>The instant Dorothy opened the door, she saw a dark passage within it.</p>

  <p>Somehow, she felt drawn towards it, as though there was some source of power hidden in its depths.</p>

  <p>After a moment's hesitation, Dorothy walked past the door's threshold determinedly.</p>

  <p>The door was opened in the Myriad Spirits City in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. It appeared for only a moment before it quietly disappeared with Dorothy.</p>
