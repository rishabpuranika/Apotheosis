</p>

  <p>"It's just a sword spirit. At its level, it is barely of any of use to you now,"</p>

  <p>Holy Drew said with indifference.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but shoot him a cold glare.</p>

  <p>Given the two Holy Beings' strength, they could've definitely prevented this from happening, but they chose to do nothing.</p>

  <p>It was understandable for Luo Luo Zheng to feel frustrated. However, he was soon able to calm down.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew and Holy Jay were both outsiders after all.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay simply asked Holy Drew to refine Luo Zheng's body as per Luo Xiao's request.</p>

  <p>A Holy Being was a legendary figure, a supreme existence even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that these two Holy Beings helped Luo Luo Zheng a lot.</p>

  <p>He couldn't really blame them for not helping Xun.</p>

  <p>'I can only rely on myself, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought angrily, but he did not let it show on his face.</p>

  <p>He had initially planned on asking Holy Jay for help in recovering Xun's memories. But given what just happened, Luo Luo Zheng figured that it was no use asking him anything.</p>

  <p>"Hurry! Show me your strength!" Holy Drew urged. He did not want to talk about the insignificant sword spirit. All he cared about was his handiwork of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>A weapon refiner always had to make sure their weapon was up to standards in order to qualify as a masterpiece.</p>

  <p>Despite Luo Zheng's concern for Xun, Holy Drew's words pulled him out of his worries and made him check out his own body.</p>

  <p>Ever since he woke up, he could already feel a great change within him, as if this body was totally different from what it used to be.</p>

  <p>It was as if there was a transparent film around him and this film also had some sort of mysterious connection with his soul.</p>

  <p>As he thought about it, a transparent film appeared and indeed covered his entire body.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>Curiosity was written all over Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>However, Holy Drew did not give him an answer. The weapon refiner wanted Luo Luo Zheng to discover the mysteries of his own body by himself.</p>

  <p>The transparent film looked similar to water that constantly surged on top of Luo Zheng's body like second skin. He quickly realized that his mind had the ability to control this film.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he repeated his question.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew simply gave him a wicked grin.</p>

  <p>"This is a protective treasure. I used a piece of the source of Godly Tile for this," he told Luo Luo Zheng. "I named it the Redemption Armor. Do you like it?"</p>

  <p>"The Redemption Armor?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes couldn't help but light up in surprise. Deciding to put the treasure to the test, he thought of turning it into a robe to cover his naked body. To his amusement, it did turn into one! "Wow! This is amazing!" he exclaimed. The treasure Holy Drew gave him was now connected to his very soul and behaved in accordance with his will.</p>

  <p>"It can change itself into any shape and color," Holy Drew reminded him. "Just try it! You'll love it!"</p>

  <p>"It can change its color too?" he asked, but Holy Drew didn't need to answer. As soon as the words left his mouth, the robe had turned black.</p>

  <p>It looked the same as any other ordinary robe and the lower helm even fluttered in the breeze.</p>

  <p>"Interesting!" Luo Luo Zheng smiled in amusement.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew turned to Tianming. "Hey, try attacking your friend with all your might," he told the young man.</p>

  <p>His words stunned Tianming, who had to look at Holy Jay for confirmation.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay merely nodded, basically telling Tianming to just do as Holy Drew said.</p>

  <p>Since there were two Holy Beings present, Tianming didn't think he'd be able to seriously injure Luo Luo Zheng. It was with this small comfort that he drew out his sword and trained his gaze at his friend.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, prepare yourself!" he growled.</p>

  <p>The sword in Tianming's hand bloomed with a strong light that made the fire around them roll away in fear.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sword in the young man's hand was a bit of a shock for Holy Drew. He hadn't really paid attention to Tianming this entire time and just realized that he actually wielded the Soaring Snake Sword!</p>

  <p>This sword was once the weapon of the Lord of Weapons. All weapon refining methods were created by him.</p>

  <p>Sabers, swords, axes, hammers, halberds... All of these weapons were created by Chiyou, the Lord of Weapons. His method remained foolproof and superior despite already being so ancient.</p>

  <p>There was little innovation in the weapon refining history and, after countless divine eras, they could still only make supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>It was only Holy Drew who managed to forge out a new path by creating supreme chaotic weapons. This was the reason why he was so highly-respected in the divine land. His ability and talent to have created a weapon totally different from the ones the Lord of Weapons made was incredibly impressive.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake Sword was one of the Lord of Weapons' famous swords. 'It turns out that a part of Chiyou's treasures had been in Luo Xiao's hands all along. This young man most probably got this sword from him.' Holy Drew thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Tianming raised his sword. The edge reflected light and formed a curtain that served as a bridge between him and Luo Luo Zheng. Without any warning, he suddenly rushed towards his friend head-on!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As Tianming thrust his sword, the pointed end served as an oversized pair of scissors that cut the space in front of it into two parts.</p>

  <p>The tip was pressed against Luo Zheng's robe.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's robe that had originally been soft turned into an extremely hard piece of armor with just one thought from him!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A crisp sound emanated from the clash between the sword and the robe.</p>

  <p>Instead of cutting through, Tianming's blade slipped to one side of Luo Zheng's robe. It was unable to cut through the Redemption Armor but it was at least able to scratch its surface.</p>

  <p>However, the scratch was only there for a split second as the armor immediately repaired itself in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Tianming sheathed his sword and cupped his hands towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations Luo Luo Zheng! The armor is indeed amazing!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and cupped his hands towards Holy Drew. "Thank you so much, Holy Drew, for giving me such valuable armor!"</p>

  <p>He was grateful for their help but Luo Luo Zheng knew they didn't do it simply out of the goodness of their hearts. He was sure there was a condition that had to be fulfilled in exchange for this treasure.</p>

  <p>It was no problem for Luo Luo Zheng. Whatever that favor was, he swore to repay it in the future.</p>

  <p>"Refining your body was an attempt on my part. I loved the process.</p>

  <p>However, your body's strength still hasn't reached the level of a first-class supreme chaotic weapon," Holy Drew told him.</p>

  <p>His words confused Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You'll figure out soon enough," Holy Drew said. He had even changed the young man's body to some extent, but he didn't see the need to tell Luo Luo Zheng about it. There was no doubt that the young man would figure it out for himself eventually.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's body was only as powerful as a supreme chaotic weapon, he still felt significantly stronger than before. He tried activating one percent of strength source from the nine stars and his body was as sturdy as ever.</p>

  <p>After refining Luo Zheng's body, Holy Drew did not intend to stay any longer.</p>

  <p>As soon as he deemed Luo Zheng's body fit and up to his standards, he quickly turned to smoke and left the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>With Holy Drew gone, Holy Jay then turned to face Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, and the nine Genuine Dragons. "I've received news of the Sacred race commencing with their attack on the universe."</p>

  <p>"They started so soon?"</p>

  <p>Tianming's heart couldn't help but skip a beat at this information. Even the nine Genuine Dragons seemed surprised at this news.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay simply nodded in confirmation.</p>

  <p>The person who stood in front of Luo Luo Zheng and the others was only his incarnation. The real Holy Jay was still in the divine land. He had recently gotten news of Murphy asking the Sacred race to attack the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"You haven't got much time," Holy Jay told them.</p>

  <p>If the Sacred race managed to take up the whole universe and destroy it, then Luo Xiao would perish. He would no longer be a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Given enough time, the ten Godly Geniuses could stay in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to cultivate for dozens, even hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>A hundred years wasn't long for a warrior.</p>

  <p>However, time was a luxury they couldn't afford. Luo Luo Zheng already knew that they would have to move fast against the Sacred race the moment he left the Evolutionary Universe. He just didn't expect that it would only take their foes a year before making their move.</p>
