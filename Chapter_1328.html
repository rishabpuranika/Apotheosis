<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1328 Thirteen Palaces Of The Heavenly Alliance </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If one took all the talents of Myriad Spiritual Force House and divided them into several tiers, Fenton would stand at the very top! All the rest, from the second place to the hundredth place, would belong to the second tier.</p>

  <p>And to think Fenton hadn't even reached the Soul Sea Realm yet! That wasn't all, Fenton had also already gone through nine small Heavenly Tribulations!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remembered the time when he swallowed the Tribulation Flower.</p>

  <p>According to the cyan dragon, this flower only appeared in the Lower World and was a rare treasure. Thus it was a benefit that only the martial artists in the Lower World could enjoy.</p>

  <p>The Tribulation Flower forced a martial artist to undergo nine life and death tribulations.</p>

  <p>It might sound horrible but these tribulations served to strengthen a warrior. Once someone entered the Life and Death Realm, the amount of small Heavenly Tribulation he went through would solidify his foundation and make him a more powerful Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>For Fenton, to experience nine small Heavenly Tribulations without the aid of any special flower was already rare. However, the Spiritual Force Sacred Place hoped for more. They prayed that the young man would experience the legendary tenth small Heavenly Tribulation!</p>

  <p>If a warrior experienced ten small Heavenly Tribulations in the Life and Death Realm and managed to withstand all of them then it was very likely for this person to become a Supreme Lord in the future!</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord nurtured by them would be a great glory for the Spiritual Force Sacred Place! They all pinned their hopes onto Fenton.</p>

  <p>Their ranking in the Spirit Reading World was not an ideal situation.</p>

  <p>They were often subject to the suppression of the top two sacred places.</p>

  <p>However, this dynamic might change if Fenton became a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>There was no denying that Fenton was a treasured disciple. When he came up to speak, Mervin immediately fell silent.</p>

  <p>As Fenton was considered the strongest and the one with the most potential in the Myriad Spiritual Force House, his words were taken with the highest regard, even more than their supervisors' words.</p>

  <p>If Fenton said that Mervin was not qualified, then he was not qualified!</p>

  <p>No questions asked!</p>

  <p>Everyone was silent since nobody had any initiative to argue. However, a trace of confusion still appeared in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Why did Fenton say that Mervin was not qualified?</p>

  <p>This newly ascended warrior named Luo Zheng was only a Life and Death Realm martial artist. It was glaringly obvious that he was not Fenton's match.</p>

  <p>A talent that had already gone through nine small Heavenly Tribulations was a legendary force to be reckoned with. He was waiting for the tenth one to come. That was why he hadn't reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>However, he could enter the Soul Sea Realm any time if he wanted.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Zheng could ever hope to compare to Fenton.</p>

  <p>To think of such a thing was laughable. How could a fifth-level Life and Death Realm warrior ever face off against the great Fenton? There were over one hundred thousand people out there in the Holy City at that level.</p>

  <p>They might not openly go against Fenton's words, but a lot of them wanted to refute what he said. There was just no way they could believe it! Fenton was a super talent that was trained with all the resources of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. In this place, Fenton's word was law and none of them could do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Fenton calmly sized Luo Zheng up as he approached, "I want to challenge you."</p>

  <p>This shocked everyone present! After agreeing with Luo Zheng about Mervin not being qualified to challenge him, Fenton actually went and challenged Luo Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>What was happening?</p>

  <p>To them, Luo Zheng didn't even deserve to breathe in Fenton's direction, much less fight him.</p>

  <p>Any of the top one hundred warriors in the Myriad Spiritual Force House would be enough to deal with Luo Zheng. The second-ranked Macsen Kan could've also sufficed if Luo Zheng proved himself capable. But Fenton? It was a humiliation to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place to think that Fenton had to come personally to deal with someone like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What was the merit in defeating such a low-levelled warrior? What did Fenton seek to gain in his challenge?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not aware of everyone's thoughts. He simply stared at Fenton with grave seriousness. Although this guy in front of him was only at the Life and Death Realm, he knew this person wasn't going to be a simple opponent.</p>

  <p>"I am not here to spar with anyone. I'm just waiting for someone," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Ha! You don't have the guts, right?"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say that Fenton doesn't have the qualifications to fight you this time?"</p>

  <p>"There will always be a price to pay for your arrogance! Since you don't want to accept his challenge, kneel down and kowtow thirty-thousand times! No, three hundred thousand times!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's refusal of Fenton's challenge convinced them that the warrior was indeed weak and was afraid of losing against such a great warrior. All confusion over Fenton's acknowledgement of Luo Zheng was thrown out of the window and replaced with some kind of sick gratification that they were right in assuming Zheng's weakness.</p>

  <p>Fenton, however, wasn't giving up that easily. "You cannot refuse."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Zheng asked curiously. He didn't take this guy as an unreasonable person.</p>

  <p>"Because this is the order of the Saint Lord. He wants me to challenge you," he replied.</p>

  <p>There was no need to hide it. He had to tell Luo Zheng the truth that this was the Saint Lord's order.</p>

  <p id="top_15">"The Saint Lord wants Fenton to challenge Luo Zheng? What's going on!?"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Who is this Luo Zheng that made the Saint Lord give out such a ridiculous order�."</p>

  <p>Everyone was suddenly abuzz with discussion.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was a bit confused. Was this the Saint Lord's plan all along? To make him stay in the Myriad Spiritual Force House temporarily so that Fenton could issue him a challenge? Why?</p>

  <p>Fenton noticed the conflicted look on Zheng's face. "The Saint Lord is doing this for me. He wants to recommend me to the alliance but you have already been chosen by them. If I defeat you, then I can prove my strength to the alliance and make them choose me. This is the reason why the Saint Lord issued such an order."</p>

  <p>"The alliance�" Luo Zheng mumbled, realizing a few things. There was clearly someone in the alliance who wanted him. The Saint Lord took this as an opportunity to further his own plans. Luo Zheng quickly understood the logic behind all this.</p>

  <p>That didn't mean he had any idea what this alliance was about.</p>

  <p>However, the talents of the Myriad Spiritual Force House were very familiar with it and were greatly shocked.</p>

  <p>Mervin, along with those who clashed with Luo Zheng earlier, finally understood why Luo Zheng hadn't been impressed by the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>

  <p>This guy had already been selected by the alliance!</p>

  <p>"This, this... Why! Why was someone like him chosen by the alliance?!"</p>

  <p>"How could he be so lucky? He is just an ascended warrior. How is he qualified to join the alliance?"</p>

  <p>"A talent like Fenton doesn't have the qualifications to join the alliance but this kid was chosen by them! No wonder the Saint Lord issued out such an order! This is truly outrageous!"</p>

  <p>The outburst from everyone present quickly signified that none of them agreed with this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, in the midst of it all, still had no idea what this alliance was.</p>

  <p>In truth, this alliance was a general term and it wasn't anything to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>It was a large human power established by the Supreme Lord of Oracle - the Heavenly Alliance!</p>

  <p>It consisted of three thousand supreme worlds and was considered to be one of the top forces in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Force Sacred Place was a member of this Heavenly Alliance and the Spirit Reading World was only one of the three thousand supreme worlds it covered.</p>

  <p>Warriors of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place also automatically belonged to the alliance.</p>

  <p>However, all the supreme worlds, including the Spirit Reading World, could only be considered as the outer supreme worlds of minor importance on the periphery of Heavenly Alliance.</p>

  <p>When Fenton said he wanted to join the alliance, that meant that he actually wanted to join one of the thirteen palaces that formed its core.</p>

  <p>Each of the thirteen palaces occupied a supreme world and was led by a world lord who enjoyed a higher standing than the regular world lords of other supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>These thirteen palaces formed the core of the alliance, after all, and were greatly revered by all.</p>

  <p>To join the thirteen palaces meant access to the best martial arts sacred place in the world, which also meant getting in was extremely hard since admission was extremely selective.</p>

  <p>Only renowned talents with monstrous strength deserved a spot. They were either descendants of Supreme Lords and world lords, or had special physiques that were extremely rare and were thus valued highly.</p>

  <p>How could someone like Luo Zheng be selected by the thirteen palaces? What exactly was going on?</p>

  <p>The warriors present instantly felt envious of Luo Zheng. It also only took a moment for their jealousy to turn into rage. They didn't like him then and they surely hated him now.</p>

  <p>What one did not have, they yearned for. And when they saw someone having this thing they wanted so much, it was in their selfish nature to start hating this privileged person.</p>

  <p>How could a nobody from the Lower World be selected to join the prestigious thirteen palaces of the Heavenly Alliance?</p>

  <p>Fenton, however, was a righteous warrior and he did not carry these thoughts in his heart. He was neither jealous of Luo Zheng nor did he hate him.</p>

  <p>"I understand why the Saint Lord did this. Gold shines no matter where it is. It's a good thing to enter the thirteen palaces but it is not the only path one can take to succeed," he said calmly.</p>
