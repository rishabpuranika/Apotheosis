<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2721 Contaminated Blood </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The first statue took Chiyou's shape.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was very well familiar with it since he had witnessed the same occurrence a couple of times. But it was the first time he had seen the other eight statues.</p>

  <p>The eight statues differed in shape.</p>

  <p>For instance, the second statue's head was like a bull's. A pair of horns almost took up half of its head. On its back was a double headed axe, making its appearance look fearless.</p>

  <p>The third statue's head was like an eagle's. It had wings on its back and a pair of three-pronged spears on its hands.</p>

  <p>The fourth statue...</p>

  <p>"These eight people's statues are listed beside Chiyou's. Are they the leaders of the nine tribes of the Nine Li race?" Luo Zheng muttered and questioned.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race had nine tribes, hence its name. Chiyou was the head of nine tribes, so he was called the Grand Chieftain.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he heard this answer. "How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I know. My master was very observant in the Source World.</p>

  <p>After all, the Nine Li race was well-known. How could I not know? But you, Chiyou's descendant, know nothing." No. 9527 laughed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a little embarrassed. Since he didn't grow up in the Source World, he rarely knew anything about it.</p>

  <p>"Look at that guy who looks like a bull. His name is Harvey Li. The bull head is not his original appearance, but just a mask. He is so powerful and reckless that he doesn't listen to anybody except Chiyou. The one who looks like an eagle is called Ambrose Li, and the following ones are..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng silently memorized the names of the eight people in his heart as he listened to all the information being said. After thinking for a moment, he asked, "But why are the leaders of the Nine Li tribes here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I am a wisp of my master's soul, not Chiyou's. I can't have a full guess of what is in his mind," No. 9527 responded.</p>

  <p>Hearing its response, Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had been following Luo Zheng for a short time. It appeared to be dull at the very beginning, but the current it already learned and had gained its own personality.</p>

  <p>The nine statues were lined up in a row, and right in the middle was a dark passage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a step and moved along the passage. Just as he passed Chiyou's statue, the entire hall started to vibrate.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The eyes on the statues had suddenly begun to glow.</p>

  <p>Faint yellow small balls appeared at the same time above the statues' heads. They were rotating flexibly, emitting great power.</p>

  <p>The formidable power was spread and he was instantly enveloped by it.</p>

  <p>His face showed a vigilant look and he took two steps back.</p>

  <p>Just as he was forced to move back, he noticed a human shaped gray shadow that appeared in the center of the hall.</p>

  <p>It stood upright in the center as its neck, which was formed by the gray shadow, quickly stretched out until it reached him. As soon as it was right in front of him, a dry voice rang out from the depths of the hall.</p>

  <p>"Whoever enters the Reincarnation Hall can choose one of the secret theurgies before leaving."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the grey human figure in front of him and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I... I'm the soul guarding the Reincarnation Hall," the shadow responded.</p>

  <p>"I see..." Luo Zheng went silent and thought for a while.</p>

  <p>"It's almost the same as those weapon spirits," No. 9527 explained. "It can be considered as a soul, the same as the weapon spirits. It has been living for a long time, so it is quite difficult to communicate with it."</p>

  <p>The underlying meaning behind No.9527's words was that it itself was much more capable and stronger than this kind of soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but smile and asked, "What are the secret theurgies?"</p>

  <p>"Look." The shadow's arm stretched out all the way to the top of the nine statues. Its finger pointed at the rotating small balls as it revealed, "These are the secret theurgies. They can be used once, and they will be triggered at critical moments."</p>

  <p>They sounded like some magic weapons for life saving.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze swept past the small balls and found that there was no small ball on the seventh statue. "Why is the small ball on that statue gone?"</p>

  <p>"It has been picked by someone," the soul answered back.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean Gregorio Yue?" Luo Zheng asked to confirm his thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he said his name was Gregorio Yue," the soul answered automatically.</p>

  <p>'It seems that the Stone Mouse didn't lie to me about this, ' Luo Zheng thought in his mind, but his real target was more than that.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what these secret theurgies were, but he had had many ways to save his life.</p>

  <p>"What if I want to control the Reincarnation Land?" Luo Zheng bluntly asked.</p>

  <p>The soul became silent for a few seconds after his straightforward question.</p>

  <p>It took a while before the silence was broken as the entire hall began to shake again.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Something constantly surged on the ground, and a loud roar was heard from afar.</p>

  <p>The floor, which was paved with thick cubic stones, unceasingly quaked.</p>

  <p>The cubic stones continued to rise and fall. The thing in the distance made a movement and in a flash moved in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a square container the size of a cubic stone on the ground.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the delicate container was a groove where a golden red sharp knife was placed.</p>

  <p>The knife was shining with sharp light. It simply signified that it was by no means an ordinary weapon.</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Hall is an important place of the divine land. The person in charge needs to have the blood of the Nine Li race. If you want to try it, you need to have your blood tested," the soul spoke in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>What the soul said had made Luo Zheng slightly raise his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Chiyou surely had made a well thought plan.</p>

  <p>This place was in charge of and was responsible for the reincarnation secret of the entire divine land, so it couldn't be controlled by the outsiders.</p>

  <p>Gregorio was the first person to get the Stone Mouse. He was eager to rule the Reincarnation Land, but was unfortunately stuck in the last step.</p>

  <p>He was not even from the Nine Li race, so he was doomed to fail.</p>

  <p>The people from the Nine Li race had long perished in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even if Gregorio was a Holy Being, it was difficult for him to find the blood of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made up his mind and naturally wouldn't miss such a good chance.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he picked up the knife.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The knife was so sharp that it could easily cut Luo Zheng's finger even if his body was firm.</p>

  <p>"Tinkle!"</p>

  <p>A drop of golden blood dropped into the container and kept rolling at the bottom.</p>

  <p>It rolled for a long time before it dispersed and disappeared at the bottom of the container.</p>

  <p>For a short while, there was a pause.</p>

  <p>The soul spoke, "You are a member of our Nine Li race, but your blood has been contaminated."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng frowned. "How could my blood be contaminated?"</p>

  <p>Back in the universe, Luo Zheng's blood had been replaced by a golden one. But despite the blood transfusion, his blood was still pure. As the soul of the hall mentioned that his blood had been tainted, he felt dejected. Why?</p>

  <p>"It's because my master's blood has blended with yours," No. 9527 reminded.</p>

  <p>A sudden realization came to mind as he remembered that in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, his body was injected with the blood of the Chaos Ancient God. It was during the time when he activated the Blood Wild Body.</p>

  <p>It all made sense. The blood in his body now was not pure.</p>
