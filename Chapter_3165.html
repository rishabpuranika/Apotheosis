<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3165 Feng Ge </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The center of the Bloom Divine Province was circled by massive mountains with razor sharp peaks. As one approached the Vastness Mountain's location, the long and narrow mountain range sloped down sharply.</p>

  <p>To the side of the Origin Mountain lay the Dragon City. Its name was derived from how, from a bird's eye view, the mountain range resembled a coiled dragon, poised to strike.</p>

  <p>"Konner." Luo Zheng cleared his throat. "Since the various super forces all seem to be short on soul crystal, how is it possible that the Taiyi Heaven Palace would offer it as rewards at the Seven Mountains Meeting? They even take out a premium Other Shore Treasure as a reward for the champion!"</p>

  <p>The Seven Mountains Meeting was held every three years. Even if the Taiyi Heaven Palace was wealthy, it entailed huge expenditure to offer such extravagant rewards.</p>

  <p>Konnor smiled. "Because, Luo Zheng, there isn't much time left."</p>

  <p>"Here we go again..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes. It wasn't the first time he encountered such a remark.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what do you think of the situation of this world?" Konnor asked Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>"The world is peaceful," replied Luo Zheng with a shrug.</p>

  <p>It was true that there was unrest in six provinces under the Taiyi Heaven Palace's rule. Aside from the problem of Mountain Viewing Province, which was quite troublesome to deal with, the skirmishes in the other provinces were not much of a threat. He got such conclusion based on what he had observed along the way when he went to the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>"Indeed. Not only our Taiyi Heaven Palace, but also the several major nonhuman races, who were fighting fiercely in the Source World before, have calmed down now. It can be said that in the past hundred years, we are witnessing the most peaceful era in the Source World," Konnor agreed.</p>

  <p>"However," he continued in a grave tone, "the situation might appear peaceful on the surface. But in reality, there is great turbulence. While there might be a balance between the super forces now, it is very fragile. The slightest tipping of the scale, and all hell will break loose in the Source World. When the war breaks out, the Taiyi Heaven Palace could not stay out of it."</p>

  <p>Konnor was, after all, a descendant of a noble clan. And since he held a high position, he was aware of the delicate political climate.</p>

  <p>"So, with every Seven Mountains Meeting, the rewards grow more and more valuable. This encourages us to grow stronger," Konnor finished with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I see..." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Although Konnor had not explicitly said so, Luo Zheng figured that the disputes among the super forces were due to the different ways they chose to take.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng recalled what Qiu Yinhe had said. This world was so chaotic, that one wrong move could cause worlds of trouble. Before they reached that point, they needed to prepare.</p>

  <p>Just then, the flying ship passed the peak of the Vastness Mountain, and before them lay huge cities, with buildings scattered along the mountain stream.</p>

  <p>The human population might be smaller than that of many nonhuman races, but with their developments for numerous years, the number of humans had still reached a notable amount.</p>

  <p>Each city probably contained tens of millions of people, and below them lay over a hundred cities! It was evident that the Taiyi Heaven Palace was enjoying an era of prosperity.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng drank in the scene of the bustling cities below. Many flying ships hovered above the cities, following the traffic rules in an orderly manner. It all resembled a well-oiled machine.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In contrast, two flying ships zoomed around, disrupting traffic as if they cared nothing of the rules. These were the Unique Array Sword Sect and the Killing Sword Sect. They whooshed forward and backward, turned upside down, hovered around and shrieks could be heard from them from time to time. The other flying ships were disturbed in their tracks and all hurriedly dodged them.</p>

  <p>But no one complained. Most of these big cities' flying ships belonged to the commercial groups and small clans. No one dared to cross the paths of the two flying ships from the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>"These guys are getting more and more arrogant," Mekhi said while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"They act this way because they're bored with the rigid training in their sects - especially those lunatics from the Killing Sword Sect!" another person said, then laughed.</p>

  <p>These people seemed to understand the behavior of these disciples from the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, with regards to the cultivation methods, that of the Heart Flow Sect was the most lax, but it attached great importance to talent. On the other hand, both the Killing Sword Sect's and the Unique Array Sword Sect's cultivation methods relied heavily on training, hence they were very strict with their disciples.</p>

  <p>An hour later, their flying ship finally slowed down in front of a mountain.</p>

  <p>It was as though the top was sliced off, leaving a leveled plateau. Rows of different kinds of buildings stood on this plateau.</p>

  <p>The flying ship stopped in front of a long yet narrow building. Everyone got off the ship, including Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered the hall of the building, they were greeted by the sounds of laughter, merry singing, and dancing. On the high platform in the distance, a row of women in pink danced and sang softly.</p>

  <p>Most of the disciples from the other several mountains had already arrived and were seated, being served wine and tea by their maids.</p>

  <p>Because they had all come from long and difficult training, they had decided to let loose and enjoy themselves.</p>

  <p>Konnor led the group towards their table. As they walked, people started turning to look at them.</p>

  <p>"Here comes the Heart Flow Sect."</p>

  <p>"Eh? Where is the little guy who acted so arrogantly last time?"</p>

  <p>"Why can't I see him?"</p>

  <p>It was Milo who had led the Heart Flow Sect to victory in the last Seven Mountains Meeting. The fact that an unpopular sect had won the famed competition left the other sects frustrated, hence they paid special attention to them now.</p>

  <p>"Konnor!" a voice boomed. "Where is Milo?" A largely-built man asked from a table not far away.</p>

  <p>This man's name was Kamron Qi. He was the most powerful warrior of the young generation in the Azure Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Kamron," Konnor greeted him with a respectful bow. "Milo is in seclusion. It's a pity that he won't take part in the Seven Mountains Meeting this time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he is cultivating in seclusion?" Kamron laughed heartily. "Perhaps it is because he doesn't dare to come here again! What a disappointment!</p>

  <p>Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The people around Kamron Qi all burst into laughter as well.</p>

  <p>Milo's absence to this competition actually came as a relief to them, but to save face, they pretended to be disappointed.</p>

  <p>As soon as the elites of the Heart Flow Sect took their seats, the warriors of the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect arrived.</p>

  <p>Emanating a powerful aura, they too attracted the attention of those in the hall.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng realize that the tables were all arranged in a fan-shaped formation. However, the seats in the front row were empty.</p>

  <p>With his curiosity piqued, Luo Zheng turned to Konnor and asked, "All the elites of the seven mountains have already arrived. Why there are still empty seats?"</p>

  <p>"Those're the seats for the direct descendants of each mountain," Konnor replied.</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were the direct descendants of the masters of each mountain. They didn't join any sword sect, and simply enjoyed a high status.</p>

  <p>'Direct descendants... Is Dorothy a direct descendant of the Origin Mountain?' Luo Zheng pondered silently.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Dorothy were bargaining with Wilfred in the Truth Library, she had mentioned her grandmother and the Origin Swordsmanship. If he guessed right, Dorothy might be the direct descendant of the Origin Mountain! Luo Zheng quietly wondered whether she would show up today.</p>

  <p>Just then, he felt a chill coming from the gate.</p>

  <p>Just as he turned to look where the chill was coming from, an elegant woman in a long dress slowly walked in, flanked by ten guards. She looked extraordinarily stunning; but her face was cold as ice, as though she did not know how to smile.</p>

  <p>As she walked, cold air surged, causing the ribbons on her dress to dance and flit. The moment she entered, a hush fell over the hall. Everyone turned to look at her in silent awe.</p>

  <p>Konnor leaned subtly to Luo Zheng and said in a low voice, "That is Feng Ge, the youngest daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. It is said that she was brought back from the Divine Lair."</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace had seven branches, which were the seven mountains, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi was the head of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Since Feng Ge was the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, she served as the legitimate heir!</p>
