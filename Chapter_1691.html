<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heaven Earth Board was a million feet long and a million feet wide, but only 10, 000 feet high. If one were to look at it from a distance, they would see a flat, square board.</p>

  <p>A number of Crescent Blades moved back and forth in Lucille's mind.</p>

  <p>"I found her!" she exclaimed abruptly, her eyes flying open.</p>

  <p>The first Crescent Blade pierced Shania's body.</p>

  <p>Before anyone could react, all the Crescent Blades rushed in one direction. These Crescent Blades were sharp and fast. Even Zheng hadn't been able to avoid them when he had used the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>What followed on the Heaven Earth Board was quiet massacre. Shania's body had been sliced through countless times.</p>

  <p>But no one could see the bloody scene.</p>

  <p>They only thought that Lucille was standing there in a daze.</p>

  <p>"The Ji Clan's ace talent is about to admit defeat. She's giving up on resisting."</p>

  <p>"The Demon Night's Godly Genius is so powerful! Lucille can't do anything to her."</p>

  <p>"The world of chaos really is amazing. There hadn't been a Godly Genius like her in the last tens of thousands of years. But now, ten of them have suddenly appeared out of nowhere!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the black mass of Heart Eating Insects rushed towards Lucille.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Lucille wiggled the Five-element Finger Chain she had on her fingers.</p>

  <p>From the moment the laws of the five elements fused with each other, her skin had turned gray.</p>

  <p>This light was the Five-element Body-protecting Light and was similar to the light on the surface of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, the Heart Eating Insects were ranked fourth on the Magical Insect List, and they could eat almost everything. Although the Five-element Body-protecting Light was formidable, it wouldn't be able to hold out for long.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The densely-packed swarm of Heart Eating Insects surrounded Lucille's body and began biting at the Five-element Body-protecting Light.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the first Heart Eating Insect drilled into her body, causing her an intense, gouging pain. And then, she felt the second insect's assault. Then the third...</p>

  <p>But Lucille endured the pain as she controlled the Crescent Blades to continue cutting through Shania's flesh within the board.</p>

  <p>Both of them used their formidable methods to try and destroy each other.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, Lucille sensed that Shania was slowly rising from within the board.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the real Shania appeared along with her Crescent Blades on the board.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Crescent Blades cut through the air towards Shania.</p>

  <p>This situation looked hopeless for Lucille.</p>

  <p>Shania made her way towards Lucille, smiling smugly. Not a single drop of blood had left her body, which was covered in a green liquid once the sharpness of the Crescent Blades had passed by her.</p>

  <p>"This round shall end here. Your performance wasn't bad. You were able to clearly see the flaws in my movements that I left on purpose." Shania then followed the vine beside her and stepped into the air, rising about ten feet and looking down on Lucille.</p>

  <p>'She left the flaws on purpose?'</p>

  <p>Lucille thought, surprised. The pain that was caused by the Heart Eating Insects had already made her pale. What saddened her was that the gap between her and Shania was so huge.</p>

  <p>Her opponent was like her master, and her resistance had only been induced by her words.</p>

  <p>Why was there such a huge gap between her and Shania?</p>

  <p>Lucille had been defeated in this battle, and miserably at that.</p>

  <p>Although both of them were at the Soul Sea Realm, Lucille had been led by the nose.</p>

  <p>Shania was like a player with profound skills playing a Go game. Since she had enough skills, she had deliberately left some flaws and observed her opponent's ability to seize these flaws in order to judge their strength.</p>

  <p>This was the method a master used to test their disciple.</p>

  <p>Lucille was behaving well, but Shania was already standing at a higher position, looking down on her.</p>

  <p>Even Nathan hadn't treated her like this.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a stone appeared beside Nathan, and Lucille appeared on it in a flash of light.</p>

  <p>She looked sad.</p>

  <p>Nathan knew her very well, but he didn't seem to care for her very much at the moment. Instead, he smiled and said, "I heard that you've already cultivated the Five-element Reincarnation. But you still haven't used it in this battle, right?"</p>

  <p>"I was saving it to deal with you," Lucille said sharply, deeply unhappy with his attitude.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Nathan smiled. "I don't mind. If I go to battle with Shania, I can help you teach her a lesson."</p>

  <p>"Stop boasting," Lawson said, a rather evil smile on his face. "This woman is very powerful."</p>

  <p>Even without Lawson's reminder, Nathan had felt that something was wrong with the woman.</p>

  <p>The woman was a little too strong and she had even exceeded the limits of her realm. He felt that something else was wrong too, but Nathan and the others were still geniuses of the younger generation. The only ones who could tell that Shania was the Queen of Life were the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they had used the past experiences and characteristics of the Queen of Life to confirm that. But given Nathan's and the others' experiences, they naturally could not see through Shania's background.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Nathan said indifferently, not seeming to care at all.</p>

  <p>As the number one Godly Genius, he had absolute confidence in his own strength. That confidence had already become his warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>He couldn't question his own strength. If he doubted it, his warrior spirit would break.</p>

  <p>This was Nathan's Godly Way.</p>

  <p>But he did have the confidence to defeat this woman.</p>

  <p>The battle between Shania and Lucille ended with Shania winning.</p>

  <p>But no one dared underestimate Lucille's strength. It was just that Shania was way stronger than Lucille and her strength was causing many to be wary of her.</p>

  <p>Kurt's strength had already exceeded their expectations. And now, the Godly Genius of the Demon Night race was equally strong!</p>

  <p>The ten people within the picture were busy with their own thoughts.</p>

  <p>The warriors outside the picture were discussing this animatedly.</p>

  <p>The battles of these ten people were far more exciting than they had imagined.</p>

  <p>According to the payout rate from the start, Nathan had the highest chance of winning, while Lucille also had a fair chance. She was ranked third or fourth in people's eyes.</p>

  <p>Shania had been at the bottom because she wasn't famous.</p>

  <p>But now, after this battle, Shania's chances of winning had skyrocketed.</p>

  <p>Some people became rich overnight, and some people went bankrupt.</p>

  <p>The next battle was between Karl of the Celestial Position race and Kurt.</p>

  <p>Although Karl had an eccentric personality, his strength remained unquestionable since he was a Godly Genius of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>And Kurt, who was a talent of the Hidden Spirit Temple, hid his strength well.</p>

  <p>The two of them had exchanged countless blows, but at the end of it, Karl was still no match for Kurt. So he decided to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>By the looks of it, Karl had a backup plan. But since this was not an elimination, he was unwilling to use that backup plan lightly.</p>

  <p>Kurt might not have used his full strength, but just the strength he displayed was enough for everyone to guess that he was much stronger than he looked.</p>

  <p>Once this battle was over, it was Zheng's turn.</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's second battle in the competition of the top ten warriors.</p>

  <p>Once he was put on the Heaven Earth Board, he raised his head to look at the giant hand in the sky.</p>

  <p>None of the other warriors were easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>His opponent was... Lawson.</p>

  <p>Lawson was a Godly Genius and was second only to Nathan.</p>

  <p>This person had even killed Nathan in the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>But Lawson had only participated in one battle in the previous round of battles. Zheng didn't know anything about his strength. All he knew was that he seemed to have a good relationship with Nathan and Lucille.</p>

  <p>Lawson stood on the board, his evil eyes sweeping over the place and his lips curving in a teasing smile. "Oh hi. Now I've finally met you. I've been looking forward to seeing you, Mr. Storyteller."</p>
