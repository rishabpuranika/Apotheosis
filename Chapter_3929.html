</p>

  <p>Theoretically, the four quadrants of the ancestry-level bloodline contained all the abilities.</p>

  <p>From the Abstruse Energy World to the secondary worlds, the abilities were always in the range of these four quadrants.</p>

  <p>The entire ancestry-level bloodline could restrain any energy perfectly. Zheng firmly believed in this even though he couldn't completely control the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>After all, from the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the four origin-level bloodlines below the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and the passageway of the Eternal Scroll Painting to the chaos, this point had already been proven right anywhere.</p>

  <p>However, when faced with the Great Sanskrit Light, the ancestry-level bloodline proved ineffective for the first time.</p>

  <p>Under the violent fluctuations of the bloodline, Zheng did not find any effective restraining ability. Soon after, he felt a storm within his body, and his organs violently trembled in reaction.</p>

  <p>Instantly, his arms changed again!</p>

  <p>The two arms that were covered in white hair began to contract. At the same time, the hair shed and the bones softened. Just as the two arms transformed into pure muscles, round holes appeared on the muscles' surfaces, expanding and eventually turning into suckers.</p>

  <p>"Are these octopus tentacles?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, shocked to see how his arms had changed.</p>

  <p>Although the transformation caused no pain and was an advantage, Zheng still found it terrifying.</p>

  <p>Click, click, click...</p>

  <p>The two tentacles flailed around as they were completely out of Zheng's control. Then, they drooped across the light pillar and began to wiggle.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's worry and helplessness, the Grandmaster of Heaven sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Initially, when Zheng broke the Fishing Drum, the Grandmaster of Heaven was confused profoundly. Not long after, he concluded that Zheng must have obtained the ability by chance to restrain the space theurgy.</p>

  <p>That was why the triangular world of Othniel and his Fishing Drum couldn't restrain him.</p>

  <p>However, just now, he saw with his own eyes that Zheng broke the Lawless Cage of Herbert. This had never been done before, so he was bewildered again. Could this mean that Zheng's bloodline restrained different energies?</p>

  <p>If so, why couldn't Zheng restrain the Great Sanskrit Light?</p>

  <p>This relieved the Grandmaster of Heaven. Knowing that an Eternal Realm warrior could not break the power of the foundation brought him a dose of hope.</p>

  <p>As long as he was the only one who could obtain the Sanskrit Light Body, he could kill everyone before him. However, he was going to spare Zheng because he wanted to study the man's secrets.</p>

  <p>Just as the Grandmaster of Heaven was gloating, one of the tentacles of Zheng began to suck intensely along the light wall.</p>

  <p>"You want to break the light wall in this way?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked with much spite.</p>

  <p>Gradually, small black dots appeared on the surface of the pure white light.</p>

  <p>These dots expanded and eventually formed small holes.</p>

  <p>"This tentacle is absorbing the light wall!" The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>The protective light wall formed by the Great Sanskrit Light might have seemed ordinary, but little did people know that the method of directly forming the wall with energy was very special.</p>

  <p>Because it was so rare, the Grandmaster of Heaven did not anticipate that it could be destroyed.</p>

  <p>This left the Grandmaster of Heaven speechless. Then anger rose within him as he hated Zheng even more. He thought that Zheng would be the biggest threat to the Nihility race if he was not killed at once!</p>

  <p>On behalf of the Nihility race, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw the Element Spirit Civilization as the race's greatest threat originally.</p>

  <p>The thirty-nine elite human warriors that were trapped for so many years could only be considered as trouble. The Grandmaster of Heaven believed that they could be ignored.</p>

  <p>Now, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw Zheng as a major threat.</p>

  <p>"The wall has been broken?"</p>

  <p>After the tentacle moved away, Zheng finally caught a glimpse of the holes on the light wall.</p>

  <p>Because he was over ten million feet tall, the holes were rather small to him when in fact, they were all over one hundred thousand feet wide.</p>

  <p>"Since you are in such a hurry to die, I will give you a hand!"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven raged and released the surging killing intent.</p>

  <p>Just then, the sword in his hand turned white, and then the color spread throughout his whole body.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the Grandmaster of Heaven was covered from head to toe by the white light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He slashed his sword and aimed for Zheng's head. The solid light wall did not stop him from slashing. With one roaring sound, the white sword blade was close enough to swallow Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was a smart warrior. He chose to retreat the moment he saw the sword coming down upon him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, because the tentacle was controlled by the ancestry-level bloodline, it was not in sync with all Zheng's movements. It continued to suck at the light wall.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's body backed away sharply, his arm was dragged and extended for millions of feet. It was hit by the white light sword.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Just like that, the tentacle broke and blood gushed out from the wound.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had its thoughts. While some of the blood splashed out, some also went directly inside the broken arm. The broken tentacle wriggled like a big worm, crawling along the light wall to the other side.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven could not care less about the tentacle. When he saw that Zheng retreated, he followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>In a moment, the Grandmaster of Heaven launched his second strike.</p>

  <p>However, just as the sword was swung, Judson suddenly appeared at the side. He pointed at the blade in the Grandmaster of Heaven's hand and numerous cobwebs quickly appeared.</p>

  <p>These webs were extremely thick and layered on top of one another, making it a great obstruction to the Grandmaster of Heaven's attacks.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven attempted to shake the webs off but was unsuccessful. At the same time, the shadow of Snake Goddess quickly descended and merged with the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>If any ordinary Eternal Realm warrior was fused with the shadow of Snake Goddess, they would have been eroded by the energy within it. The shadow of the real Snake Goddess had more power than that of the Snake Goddess in this chaotic era.</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven had transformed into the Sanskrit Light Body, and the shadow of Snake Goddess was completely unable to corrode the white light.</p>

  <p>"Tie!"</p>

  <p>With no intention to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, the Snake Goddess tried to temporarily trap him!</p>

  <p>"The Formless Snake Shackle!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Herbert also activated his bloodline power to utilize the shackling method. Four indistinct shadows of snake-shaped shackles appeared on the hands and feet of the Grandmaster of Heaven, coiling around his wrists and ankles.</p>

  <p>Fuxi appeared in front of the Grandmaster of Heaven. He lifted his arm and launched a palm strike at the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>What seemed like an ordinary palm strike vibrated for over ten thousand times as it came into contact with the chest of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Break the body!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi's goal was not to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven but to weaken his defense of his Sanskrit Light Body as much as possible.</p>

  <p>Next, Gerald appeared. He waved his tail and stabbed right at the center of the Grandmaster of Heaven's chest, exactly where Fuxi's palm hit.</p>

  <p>Gerald's strikes were so powerful that even Claire had been killed in his hands by the Poison of Decomposition. If the Grandmaster of Heaven was pierced deeply enough, he would die the same way Claire did.</p>
