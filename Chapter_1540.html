<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Why do you have to know these things?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Answer my questions!" The warrior now stared coldly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The corner of Zheng's mouth twitched into a faint smile when he saw the warrior's stern face. The "city lord" must have a strong background since he had so many warriors to serve him; otherwise, there wouldn't have been so many people following him.</p>

  <p>After all, everyone was of equal status in the Illusion Battlefield. This reminded Zheng of Ezra, whom Zheng assumed must also have a strong background among the ogre race. However, Ezra had only managed to trick a small number of ogre warriors to serve him in the beginning.</p>

  <p>When many of the ogre warriors realized what was really going on, no one had followed his orders.</p>

  <p>The reason why this "city lord" had such a rallying power could only be due to his status outside of the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>"The Humanity Alliance, Spirit Reading World, Spiritual Force Sacred Place," Zheng replied mechanically.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, the warrior lightly sized him up, then he called another martial artist and said, "Okay, follow him to the outside of the city. After you've paid your Illusion Points, you can leave!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was expressionless as he followed the other warrior to the north gate of the main city.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the edge of the city, Zheng finally understood why the first warrior had warned him that there would be no chance for him to leave this city without permission!</p>

  <p>On the walls of the main city, at every hundred feet, stood a Soul Sea Realm warrior who was like an iron tower. These warriors were wearing black armors and wielded light golden sabers in their hands. They looked as solemn and unforgiving as graveyard statues.</p>

  <p>"Friend, where are these warriors from? Why do they wear uniforms?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The warrior leading the way lightly glanced at Zheng, disdainful of his surprised look. "What crap! These black armored warriors are all guards of the city lord. Isn't it normal for them to dress in uniforms? What backwater city have you crawled from?"</p>

  <p>"Normal? The city lord could even bring guards into the Illusion Battlefield?" Zheng asked in amazement.</p>

  <p>Noticing the puzzled look on Zheng's face, that warrior seemed more smug and puffed up, and he even boasted of the details which he had heard,</p>

  <p>"The city lord of our main city is from one of the top three clans in the Thoughtless Minds, the Ji Clan! This time, the Ji Clan has placed great hope on the city lord to succeed in this Illusion Battlefield! They conscripted ten thousand top Soul Sea Realm warriors and sent them into the Illusion Battlefield together with the city lord!"</p>

  <p>All warriors who entered the Illusion Battlefield would randomly be sent to different main cities, but the chances of the warriors in the same region being sent to the same place had always been quite high. The Ji Clan had arranged for over ten thousand warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, so after being distributed to the main cities, twenty percent of them were allocated to other main cities. However, eighty percent of the warriors still followed the city lord and landed in this main city!</p>

  <p>This meant that from the moment the city lord from the Ji Clan had entered the Illusion Battlefield, eight thousand warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had followed him and guarded him.</p>

  <p>It was also because of these eight thousand warriors of the Soul Sea Realm that the city lord had such great power and control. He took the main city as his own and had been further growing by taking his toll from all the lesser warriors in the city!</p>

  <p>"So that explains it." Zheng nodded thoughtfully, but he was also utterly disgusted at the way in which the Illusion Battlefield system had been manipulated.</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, Zheng and the warrior escorting him had already arrived at the city gate. Not far away was a martial artist in blue who was holding a black long sword. His eyes were closed in meditation as he was gathering his energy.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the warrior in blue was a row of warriors at the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>These warriors of the Soul Sea Realm didn't have any intention of resisting. They just stood there lined up like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.</p>

  <p>They had no choice. They could still slowly continue to earn Illusion Points after paying half of their Illusion Points. If they didn't pay up, it would be impossible for them to leave this main city…</p>

  <p>The blue-robed martial artist stayed where he was for a long time before he suddenly opened his eyes in narrow slits. He had been gathering energy for a long time, and now that he activated the black sword in his hand with that energy, he could use it like it was an extension of his body.</p>

  <p>The radiance on the sword erupted. In the blink of an eye, the black long sword had slashed out!</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff…"</p>

  <p>As blood splashed, seven or eight red dots of light wrapped around the souls of these martial artists and flew into the main city behind them where they would wait to be resurrected.</p>

  <p>In addition, the yellow light dots of their Illusion Points burst forth from the ground. Because these martial artists had been slain by the blue-robed martial artist, these Illusion Points shot directly towards the blue-clothed martial artist!</p>

  <p>'It certainly saves a lot of time in accumulating Illusion Points this way...'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought. Following this line of logic, the number of Illusion Points which this guy had accumulated must definitely be quite significant. "Is he the city lord of this main city?" Zheng asked immediately.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the warrior who was leading the way shook his head and said, "No, he's not."</p>
