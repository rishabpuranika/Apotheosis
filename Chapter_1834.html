<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1834 Barbecue Luo Luo Zheng </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The members of the Collapsing Mountain began working at daybreak and retired at sunset.</p>

  <p>By now, most of the adult males had gone out hunting while the rest and some of the elders stayed within the village.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain child called over an elder.</p>

  <p>This elder was tall and bony, a white beard hanging down from his mouth that fell to ten feet long? he looked like a bamboo pole.</p>

  <p>Despite his looks, he could walk fast and vigorously amidst the powerful gravitational force. It was virtually impossible to see any signs of aging from him.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was absorbing the preternatural flames, he was still clear-headed. When he saw the elder walk over, he silently put up his guard.</p>

  <p>There didn't seem to be any logic in the Collapsing Mountain race. It didn't seem like a good idea to offend them.</p>

  <p>When the elder saw the flames, he was left stunned. A trace of fear flashed in his eyes, as though the flames awakened genuine fear in him.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Luo Zheng frantically absorbing the flames, a strange expression surfaced in his old eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>With that, the elder rushed away.</p>

  <p>In no time, a large group of Collapsing Mountain elders appeared.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't noticed there were so many of them, but now, over fifty had already gathered before him.</p>

  <p>All of them were as tall as bamboo poles and were chattering away about something.</p>

  <p>Some naughty kids kept their eyes on Luo Luo Zheng and figured that the flames on his body weren't as dangerous as they first thought. So they took their sticks and moved in to play with the flames, but they were quickly stopped by the elders.</p>

  <p>They were talking in their own language.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng didn't understand what they wanted to do.</p>

  <p>As the chatter went on, their voices grew louder and louder. When the Collapsing Mountain members roared, it was as though the mountains were truly collapsing and the earth was cracking.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists that were lying on the ground heard a buzzing sound in their ears. If the elders were to roar at the mountain like this, they would probably cause a landslide.</p>

  <p>Within the flames, Han Liusu and Luo Luo Zheng looked at each other puzzlingly as they lay on the ground with their hands holding each other. Neither of them could understand the language of the Collapsing Mountain race, so they had no clue why the people were bickering.</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Just then, the old man taking the lead suddenly brandished a walking stick in his hand.</p>

  <p>By the dignified expression he wore, one would assume he had a high position in the Collapsing Mountain race. As he waved his walking stick, all the sounds disappeared in an instant. And then everyone fell silent.</p>

  <p>Then, he walked over with the aid of his walking stick and asked Luo Luo Zheng sternly, "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's body refining was nearing its end and his desire for the flames had already been satisfied. But Han Liusu was still releasing the preternatural flames because she couldn't fully control them yet. But it didn't matter.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng heard the old man's words, his heart skipped a beat. From the looks of it, the old man didn't mean him well. Did he do something to offend the elder? "I am  Luo Luo Zheng Luo," he replied with the truth.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo? What a good name!" Much to Luo Zheng's surprise, the man's expression and tone of voice shifted? he suddenly became amiable.</p>

  <p>Even Han Liusu was baffled. Shouldn't the old man have been more interested in her preternatural flames? Why was he only paying attention to Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>After asking Luo Luo Zheng for his name, the old man took his leave, leading the group of elders away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no clue what they were planning to do. Even after some discussion with Han Liusu, they still hadn't come up with an answer.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, Liusu's preternatural flames finally stopped. The flames on Luo Zheng's body began to extinguish soon after.</p>

  <p>When the flames were extinguished, so were Luo Zheng's clothes.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu screamed in surprise and shut her eyes tight. Her own clothes were sewn with the priceless water threads from the divine land? they weren't made of any material object, but of a special kind of tangible light that could be used to sew clothes. It was rather popular in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Such a material was expensive, of course, because the water threads were made by changing part of the laws of light. Anyone who knew of this technique was by no means ordinary.</p>

  <p>Clothes made from water threads were free from dust and filth? they would be as shiny as new even after several years.</p>

  <p>Liusu's preternatural flames used to burn all her clothes to the point of leaving her naked. It was so humiliating for her that her brother spent much time and effort getting her this set of clothes made of water threads.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't have such clothes.</p>

  <p>Every time he was burned by the preternatural flames, his clothes were turned to ashes. The situation left him feeling indecent and extremely embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Before, after the flames were gone, he would merely change into a new set of clothes.</p>

  <p>But at the moment, it was difficult for him to move. With a slight movement of his finger, he triggered the space ring and pulled out a blanket to cover himself.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu lay there, the awkward atmosphere rendered them speechless. Carefully, Luo Luo Zheng retracted his hand? he didn't feel it appropriate to hold onto the girl's hand in this situation.</p>

  <p>For some reason, there was a slight sense of loss in Liusu's heart.</p>

  <p>After the body refining by preternatural flames, Luo Zheng's body conveyed a very unique feeling.</p>

  <p>It was as though the strength of his body had increased by several times with each body refining. It was as if his body was reborn.</p>

  <p>This time, a strange feeling overcame him, as though all the muscles and bones in his body were under his control. A person's muscles were driven by nerves that gathered in the spine, moving along until they gathered in the brain, and then controlled by the soul.</p>

  <p>But there were always some tissues in the body without nerves. No matter how refined a body was, it was impossible to control every single muscle. For instance, a heart couldn't be made to move left and right, nor could the stomach be freely stretched.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng seemed to be able to do such things.</p>

  <p>The new abilities made him feel even stranger than he already was like he was becoming a monster.</p>

  <p>But because he couldn't move, he couldn't verify his conjecture. He couldn't check how far his body had reached after absorbing the flames, either, so he had to wait for the right opportunity to do so.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, after his body refining, he felt a great increase in his physical strength, along with his power. With the help of the dragon scales, the time to get up was just around the corner.</p>

  <p>When night fell, everything just got more difficult.</p>

  <p>As the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance permeated the air, the grilled meat of the Collapsing Mountain members also began emanating a fragrant aroma.</p>

  <p>Just when Luo Luo Zheng was prepared to strain his nerves and face this cruel test, two of the clansmen walked up to him.</p>

  <p>After muttering to themselves, they pulled Luo Luo Zheng up from the ground.</p>

  <p>"What are you guys doing?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in concern.</p>

  <p>The two didn't answer but continued to lift him up and walk him to the huge square.</p>

  <p>As he was pulled along, Luo Luo Zheng swayed left and right. When his eyes swept across the area, he realized that many of the clansmen were looking at him with a peculiar expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but swallow? as he got closer and closer to the huge bonfires, he could feel his heart resist it. Would the Collapsing Mountain members dismember and eat his flesh?</p>

  <p>They ate a variety of creatures, after all? all sorts of fierce beasts as strong as world lords and all kinds of rare and poisonous bugs. It wouldn't be strange for them to eat him.</p>

  <p>Just as the thought plagued his mind, the two young men carried him to the front of a bonfire.</p>

  <p>The flames ignited from the Calamity Dispelling Wood were fierce? ordinary flames couldn't cook vicious beasts as strong as world lords.</p>

  <p>There was still about a hundred feet between Luo Luo Zheng and the bonfire, but he could already feel the scorching heat.</p>

  <p>The two young men stopped right in front of the bonfire and threw Luo Luo Zheng into it.</p>

  <p>'Are they really going to barbecue me?!' And that was Luo Zheng's last thought as he fell into the flames.</p>
