  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng began to recite the Truth of Cultivation by heart, he allowed himself to be completely immersed in a natural state, both his body and soul extremely relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Drip! Drip!"</p>

  <p>He was so at ease that he could hear the sound of dew rolling off the leaves, the buzzing of the mosquitoes and flies, and the noise the grass made when it was swaying in the wind.</p>

  <p>At the same time when he merged the Godly Ways, he had also made slight progress in the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>Zheng had grasped ninety-nine percent of the Truth of Cultivation Nature before. If he could break through the last obstacle, then he could begin to cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>The problem was, such an obstacle wasn't that easy to surpass. In fact, he had not yet succeeded since he left the divine land.</p>

  <p>After an entire day…</p>

  <p>A surge of extremely powerful energy emerged in the center of the green lake.</p>

  <p>The energy waves continued to spread, causing the once calm lake to tremble and roll like boiling water.</p>

  <p>Sensing that kind of change in the atmosphere, the creatures that surrounded the lake scattered in different directions.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng gently flipped his hands, a ball of extremely thick energy slowly discharged from his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>The moment he drew out the ball of energy, the lake under his body sank.</p>

  <p>"I have succeeded in merging the internal momentum again!" Zheng exclaimed with a joyful look on his face.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng had merged it once before. Compared to his previous experience, he felt that the difficulty in merging all kinds of internal momentum in his body had been greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had stepped into the consummation of True God Realm, the internal momentum released from the Godly Tile was purer and the Ways-blending Energy was more powerful.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Cultivation Nature has reached a new level as well. With just one more step, the Truth of Godly Way would reach the consummate level. I wonder how it feels like to cross the Sea of Truth," Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng descended deep in thought, a water arrow suddenly sprung out from the lake under Zheng, directly charging towards him.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The water arrow moved extremely fast. At that moment, Zheng was still circulating the Truth of Cultivation Nature, and he only slightly turned his head to the direction where the water arrow came from. It was as if he was looking backward, and had easily dodged it.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>More water arrows rose from the lake.</p>

  <p>In just a blink of an eye, thousands of water arrows flew towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Their power, however, wasn't strong. Once they hit Zheng's body, they were still just water. His body swayed casually, like a willow dancing in the wind.</p>

  <p>Even if those water arrows were as dense as the rain, they failed to wet Zheng's clothes.</p>

  <p>Zheng dodged, and his eyes wandered around with a strange smile.</p>

  <p>"Is it Margaret? Or Tia?"</p>

  <p>Despite his powerful soul, he was unable to determine who was manipulating the water arrows.</p>

  <p>Zheng avoided the water arrows and sped away to the surface of the lake.</p>

  <p>After circling the lake once, his eyes landed on the grass by the lakeside.</p>

  <p>"Whooooosh!"</p>

  <p>In a flash, Zheng was already on his way to the grass. A person was clutched in his arms as he did so.</p>

  <p>Hearing the person scream, Zheng looked down and was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>"Yan?"</p>

  <p>Her face was slightly red, and her mouth curved into a sullen pout. She then complained, "You've returned to the fairy palace but didn't even come to see me! Even if you don't want to see me, you should at least miss Geoffrey, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng returned to the fairy palace a few days ago, but he hadn't stepped into the training tower yet.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Xun and Yudie snuck into the divine land, they had arranged all the others to go into the training tower. Taking this opportunity, they also chose to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>Looking at Yan's angry face, Zheng smiled faintly. "Of course, I miss you and Geoffrey. But I heard that you were all cultivating in seclusion, so I didn't want to intrude."</p>

  <p>Yan couldn't stay mad at her brother. As she got up from the ground, she looked at Zheng and said, "I didn't expect that you've really stepped into the consummation of the True God Realm. This time, you're way ahead of me!"</p>

  <p>Originally, Yan's cultivation was far stronger than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was still a proving godly warrior, Yan had already become a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Over the past ten years, Zheng had successfully stepped into the consummation of True God Realm, while Yan remained a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could even speak, Yan added, "But I also feel that my chance of reaching the consummation of True God Real is coming soon. I guess you won't be ahead of me for long!"</p>

  <p>Yan's current situation was somehow similar to Zheng's. She was in the last stage of the Truth of Holy Words, and once she reached the consummation of True God Realm, she was done with the last step and could sail across the sea to reach the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You've always been smarter than me, so I know I'll soon fall right behind you," Zheng said with a smile. Ever since they were young, he had always looked up to Yan's talent. "But what kind of theurgy did you use to hide just now? Why couldn't I detect you?"</p>

  <p>Yan smiled and said, "It's Gus. He controls the entire Swirl Forest. He easily helped me hide the aura!"</p>

  <p>"He controls the Swirl Forest and can hide people's aura?" Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"It's not that strange. Harold can also do it in the Everest Spirit Mountain," said Yan, and she seemed to take it as a normal thing.</p>

  <p>Yan had stayed in the Everest Spirit Mountain for a long time, so she knew what abilities the controllers of the forbidden areas usually possessed.</p>

  <p>Back then, she could just freely come and go in the Everest Spirit Mountain and could even control all the beasts in it. It was all thanks to Harold.</p>

  <p>"So that explains it." Zheng nodded lightly.</p>

  <p>Consummate True Gods that could control forbidden areas were indeed qualified to fight against Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back! Geoffrey would be so happy to see you!" Yan exclaimed with excitement in her eyes.</p>

  <p>After all, back in the fairy palace, not only Yudie and his other wives were there, but also Geoffrey, Freya, and Imogen.</p>

  <p>When they heard that Zheng had returned, they came out of the training tower.</p>

  <p>In the fairy palace, Geoffrey stood in the hall dressed in a long pale purple robe, with a precious belt tied around his waist.</p>

  <p>He had definitely matured.</p>

  <p>He had a slight resemblance to Zheng, but his temperament was softer.</p>

  <p>With smart eyes, Geoffrey looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey!"</p>

  <p>Over the years, they seldom got together. Zheng felt a little guilty about that.</p>

  <p>Every time they reunited, he was always thrilled to see how his son had grown, which was always a surprise.</p>

  <p>Back then, Geoffrey begged for a chance to wander around the divine land. After only ten years, he had followed Yudie's and Xun's improvement and had already become a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that it wasn't going to be long before Geoffrey could become a low-rank True God, especially with the guidance of consummate True Gods and a Demi-holy Being in the fairy palace, apart from his own extraordinary talent.</p>

  <p>If Harold could help him change his blood, then he should be able to step into the divine land without needing the protection of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"Daddy, how I've missed you after all these years! Do you miss me?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey asked as he blinked his eyes. There was a hint of sadness in them.</p>

  <p>Hearing his son's words, Zheng even felt more guilty in his heart. He replied, "Of course, I do!"</p>

  <p>"Have you brought home a gift for me this time?" Geoffrey chuckled.</p>

  <p>The sadness in his eyes went away and was soon replaced by a cunning and greedy look.</p>
