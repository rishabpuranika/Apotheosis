  <p>
</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder didn't experience what Luo Zheng had gone through, so he wondered why Luo Zheng had asked such a question.</p>

  <p>In any case, he now thought even more highly of Luo Zheng since the latter had obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, what do you want to know? I will tell you everything I know," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up and asked, "What is the Four Spirits Sect? Are they the founders of the Instant Civilization?"</p>

  <p>It seemed that every secret was related to the Instant Civilization, which in turn was closely connected to the Four Spirits Sect. Thus, he wanted to know the connection between them.</p>

  <p>"Since you've already been to the Eternal Divine Courtyard, you should've known that it was the four holy spirits who formed the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>They are invincible beings in the outer world. They can create everything, as well as destroy everything. They are the creators, and the annihilators as well," said the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>The four holy spirits were human spirit, monkey spirit, snake spirit, and bird spirit. In a broad sense, it was difficult to tell if the Four Spirits Sect was good or evil.</p>

  <p>"The Instant Civilization you referred to should be the creator of the chaos.</p>

  <p>They indeed belong to the Four Spirits Sect, but they are only a small branch," he continued.</p>

  <p>As the Four Spirits Sect developed and expanded, they were divided into many factions, and each of them had a clear division of work.</p>

  <p>For instance, some of them were pioneers, responsible for exploring new worlds; annihilators, responsible for killing other creatures; others were creators who built secondary worlds and many more.</p>

  <p>"The Instant Civilization you've mentioned should be the world builders of the Four Spirits Sect. Among them, human spirits have the largest population," he explained.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng quietly lowered his head and thought deeply. The brush-wielder's answer was quite close to his guess. Then, he asked, "The world builders have built more than one world of chaos, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the brush-wielder nodded.</p>

  <p>"Did they build those worlds for the sole purpose of obtaining energy?" Luo Zheng recalled that it was what he had witnessed in the space of the Ultimate Cycle.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the brush-wielder nodded again. "The creatures in secondary worlds are quite weak, but they are in large number. After a new world is created, and once its time is accelerated, lots of extra energy will overflow. The Four Spirits Sect needs such energy for its expansion," he added.</p>

  <p>A secondary world could produce astronomical amounts of energy in one whole chaotic era.</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect had built dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of such worlds. "Then why should they end those worlds? Isn't it better to let the worlds continue to grow stronger?" Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>The pictures in the space of the Ultimate Cycle answered some of his questions, but they didn't quell his doubts.</p>

  <p>"There are too many secondary worlds. If they continued to exist, they would eventually threaten the status of the Four Spirits Sect at some point.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, extracting the energy of a world will only cause violent turmoil. After careful consideration, they concluded that destroying the secondary worlds and building them over again is the best solution," the brush-wielder answered.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Four Spirits Sect didn't just enforce their rules on a whim.</p>

  <p>Everyone regarded that as the best solution after countless years of exploration and experiments!</p>

  <p>Aside from the rules, the time span of a chaotic era, the size of the primitive land, and so on were also included. All of those were decided after a long period of attempts and experience.</p>

  <p>"You mean they are afraid that the creatures of the secondary worlds will threaten the status of the Four Spirits Sect?" Luo Zheng asked. "The creatures of our world can't even understand the space and time in the Abstruse Energy World. How is it possible for us to pose any threat to the Four Spirits Sect?" he said with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, the brush-wielder paused for a moment and asked, "Have you ever been to the Abstruse Energy World you mentioned?"</p>

  <p>According to what he knew, the Three Purities Stage should be the only exit to the outside of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng couldn't leave the chaos before he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng admitted honestly. "Is there any other way out of the chaos?" he asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, but I can't tell you about that," Luo Zheng said and shrugged.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could tell the brush-wielder everything about the Eternal Divine Courtyard since the brush-wielder himself was the ruler of the Eternal Scroll Painting. However, he wouldn't reveal anything about the fact that he had entered the Abstruse Energy World through the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder didn't pursue the matter anymore. He just said, "It's true that creatures of the secondary worlds can't survive outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, that doesn't mean that they can't threaten the Four Spirits Sect."</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect never united as a whole, and they always had severe internal conflicts.</p>

  <p>The world builders initially did not impose restrictions on the first secondary worlds. They allowed those worlds to develop freely, which resulted in the birth of many strange and powerful creatures.</p>

  <p>Most of those new creatures joined the Four Spirits Sect, but the others refused to submit. Instead, they connived with the traitors in the Four Spirits Sect, which in turn caused chaos.</p>

  <p>After that, the Four Spirits Sect restricted the development of the secondary worlds. In other words, they restarted the secondary worlds, and at the same time, extracted their energy once in a while.</p>

  <p>Still, there were many talented creatures born in the secondary worlds. Of course, it would be a big waste even for the Four Spirits Sect if all those creatures got destroyed along with the secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the world builders came up with a remedial plan to make up for their loss. They added an Other Shore on top of every secondary world. The Other Shore was like a fishing net that collected the biggest fish for them.</p>

  <p>Then, the strongest warriors in the secondary worlds would eventually enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. A few of them might manage to reach the deepest part of the Eternal Scroll Painting then they would step into the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and finally join the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>If all the secondary worlds still operated like normal and the Eternal Divine Courtyard hadn't been abandoned yet, then Luo Zheng might have already joined the Four Spirits Sect by now.</p>

  <p>However, the Four Spirits Sect had undergone drastic changes, which gave him the chance to obtain the complete ancestry-level bloodline and come back safe and sound.</p>

  <p>All those happened by sheer luck.</p>

  <p>"So that is the real use of the Other Shore," he muttered.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Snake Goddess, and the rest were all lost in thought. After a while, the Snake Goddess remarked ironically,</p>

  <p>"Looks like we're too weak to even meet the threshold of the Four Spirits Sect."</p>

  <p>All of the Eternal Realm warriors on the Other Shore were powerful enough to dominate a chaotic era. Especially during the chaotic era of the human race, where countless warriors in the Eternal Realm emerged like mushrooms after the rain.</p>

  <p>Yet, it still took them a lot of effort to obtain a root-level bloodline, not to mention the origin-level bloodline or even the ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Fuxi were all arrogant. After all, they represented the human race, and each of them had dominated a great starry region before.</p>

  <p>They rarely encountered someone on par with them in the 77th chaos, or at any other time in over one thousand rounds of chaos.</p>

  <p>Despite that, they all felt disheartened upon hearing what the brush-wielder had said. It turned out that although they had reached the Eternal Realm, they still didn't meet the threshold set by the Four Spirits Sect. Naturally, they felt dejected.</p>
