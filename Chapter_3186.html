<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Bloom Divine Province was where the Taiyi Heaven Palace was based.</p>

  <p>It was also one of the biggest gatherings of the human race. Almost all sorts of forces, clans, and commercial alliances tried to grab a place in the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>The most prosperous area in the province was the city cluster around the seven mountains of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. The Clear Lake at the north was a close second.</p>

  <p>The Clear Lake was so huge. It had over a hundred large cities within it.</p>

  <p>Most clans in the Bloom Divine Province were born from this place, prospered, and finally chose to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The clans that ruled the Vastness Mountain, the Ivory Mountain, the Golden Mountain, the Azure Mountain, and the Origin Mountain, were all from the Clear Lake. All these mountains belonged to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Everything is all well and good in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, except for the view. The Clear Lake has far better scenes to take in," Gant sighed, taking in the view before him as he stood at the edge of the Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>The Clear Lake was more than ten million miles wide, like a huge ocean.</p>

  <p>One could not see the other end of the lake.</p>

  <p>A sweet, moist breeze blew over the lake, causing the water to ripple and intoxicating the people standing near it.</p>

  <p>"The best view of the Clear Lake is the Ripple Pavilion in the southwest.</p>

  <p>It's paradise in a good season," Trish said from behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You've been to the Ripple Pavilion as well?" Gant turned to ask her, astonished.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Trish nodded but didn't offer to say anything more.</p>

  <p>"Is it strange for someone to have been to the Ripple Pavilion?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I've been there several times. It's nothing strange or even extraordinary. It's just that ordinary people can't go there. But my question is: How can someone who has the ability to visit the Ripple Pavilion work as a maid in the Heart Flow Sect?" asked Gant, staring at Trish.</p>

  <p>Trish was embarrassed. She forced a smile and said, "That's all history now.</p>

  <p id="top_22">Let bygones be bygones."</p>

  <p>Gant took one long look at her but didn't pursue the topic any further. He said after a pause, "We can go to the Goose City and rent a flying ship before it gets dark. This way, the time we spend on travel will be greatly shortened."</p>

  <p>Gant's idea came through and before dark, the three of them had rented a flying ship and were flying along the edge of the Clear Lake. Eight hours later, they arrived at Su City.</p>

  <p>Su City was just like any other bustling city. One word was written in huge calligraphic letters on the gate. 'Su, ' it read.</p>

  <p>"All of Su City belongs to your Su Clan?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Su City prospers because of our Su Clan. So yes. I guess you could say that," Gant replied.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan was a famous weapon refining clan and Su City was famous for weapon refining. The weapon refiners in the Bloom Divine Province and those in the surrounding provinces all hoped to one day grab a place in Su City. The Su Clan was happy to let people of the same trade live in the city.</p>

  <p>Once they had entered the city, every few steps they took brought them to a weapon refining workshop. There were also too many shops selling weapons and treasures.</p>

  <p>The weapons and treasures they sold were merely ordinary. It was rare to see even a primary Profound Blood Treasure in these shops.</p>

  <p>It was not because there was no first-class treasure in Su City, but because no one would dare openly sell a premium Profound Blood Treasure or even an Other Shore Treasure.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't have much need for treasures, so they quickly walked past the shops.</p>

  <p>A short distance later, a high, dark wall loomed ahead of them. Two strangely-shaped, brass yellow statues stood at the door. There were clusters of ores all over the bodies, and their eyes shone with a silver light.</p>

  <p>"They are Ore Shadow race," said Gant.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had heard Gant mention the race when they'd been in the Mountain Viewing Province. The Su Clan had been able to become a weapon refining clan because they had the blood of the Ore Shadow race.</p>

  <p>The Ore Shadow race was born from ores. They could integrate with ores, which caused them to take on different appearances from ordinary beasts.</p>

  <p>"So the Ore Shadow race looks like this," Luo Zheng mumbled.</p>

  <p>Trish stared at the door with admiration. She said, "People say that the Su Clan of the Su City is a famous weapon refining clan that works for the Taiyi Heaven Palace. I can feel their magnificence and power even while just standing at their gate!"</p>

  <p>"We are flattered," Gant said, smiling, proud at the high praise coming from Trish. "Let's go in."</p>

  <p>Two servants in silver armor bowed to him in unison and said, "Welcome back, Young Master Gant!"</p>

  <p>"Where is my father?" Gant asked.</p>

  <p>"The master is cultivating in seclusion," one of them replied.</p>

  <p>"Pass on a message to him for me. Tell him I want to meet him. It's important," said Gant.</p>

  <p>The servant bowed and left to take Gant's message to his master. Another servant brought them to the hall, where they sat down to wait.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Cailen entered the hall in a huff. His eyes hardened as they found Gant and he said, "Oh, so you do remember to come home!"</p>

  <p>The Su Clan had narrowly escaped death in the Mountain Viewing Province, but despite that, they had suffered great losses.</p>

  <p>Gant had brought Eira back home. But after that, he returned to the Dragon City and hadn't come back until now.</p>

  <p>Now that Gant had returned, Cailen was happy, but he was still a little angry.</p>

  <p>Gant smiled, embarrassed, and said, "I'm back now, aren't I?"</p>

  <p>Cailen ignored him. Instead, his whole face lit up when he saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's performance in the Mountain Viewing Province had been too amazing back then. Cailen's cultivation level wasn't that high, but he had a good eye for talents.</p>

  <p>In order to find the whereabouts of the Shade Stone, the Su Clan had held investigations in the Grand River Fortress, and they knew that the Taiyi Governor Qiu Yinhe had gone to the Mountain Viewing Province specially to save Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This news had shocked Cailen, increasing his curiosity about Luo Zheng. He believed that Luo Zheng was from an extraordinary background.</p>

  <p>Cailen suspected that Luo Zheng or Qiu Yinhe was in possession of the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>But it was not proper to question Luo Zheng about it in his face now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood up and after they exchanged greetings, he went straight to the point. "I came to visit you along with Gant, because I have a favor to ask of you."</p>

  <p>"Please tell me. If there is anything our Su Clan can do to help, we will do everything in our power to do so," Cailen said.</p>

  <p>"I want to use the Su Clan's Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Cailen froze. If Luo Zheng had asked anything else, he would have tried his best to satisfy him. But setting up the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array once would cost a lot. Moreover, refining an ordinary treasure didn't even need this array.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched Cailen hesitate for a while before he said, "I will cover the cost of setting up the array. The price will not disappoint you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a lot of divine crystals at hand.</p>

  <p>Merging with the Shade Stone was too important to him. He would use the heritage of the Nine Li race if necessary.</p>

  <p>"It's not a matter of price. Could you tell me why you want to use this array?" asked Cailen.</p>

  <p>Gant stared at Luo Zheng. The whole way here, he had been very curious about what Luo Zheng had obtained to warrant the use of the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flicked a hand and a long sword appeared in it - the Shade Phoenix Sword that Goran had awarded him.</p>

  <p>Cailen's eyes flashed with confusion at the sight of the Shade Phoenix Sword.</p>

  <p>Cailen had personally made the Shade Phoenix Sword for Goran's use. How had it appeared in Luo Zheng's hand? Was Luo Zheng a close relative of Goran?</p>

  <p>Even if he was, it was impossible for Goran to have given him a premium Other Shore Treasure. Had he stolen it from Goran?</p>

  <p>Cailen was frightened at the thought and he became instantly vigilant. But outwardly, he was calm as he asked, "Where did you get the sword?"</p>
