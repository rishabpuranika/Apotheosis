<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were a total of six sects in the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>These six sects were the most ancient groups of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>It was also these groups that controlled the ancient Demon Night bloodline. Thus, the three queens of the Demon Night always emerged from these six large sects.</p>

  <p>Back then, with Yao's help, Gunter had become the fourth Supreme Lord of the Demon Night. Naturally, his sect had also become very powerful and influential.</p>

  <p>Even the Demon Night, which had three queens as its leaders, had internal struggles.</p>

  <p>These six sects were under the control of the Board of Elders, which answered to the three queens. Thus, they were able to maintain the balance within the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>However, ever since Xun's disappearance, the balance that had been maintained before had been broken.</p>

  <p>The two sects that answered to the Queen of Life maintained their silence, just like the Queen of Life was indifferent to Yao's domineering behavior.</p>

  <p>As for the two sects that fell under the domain of the Queen of Killings, one sect sided with Yao while the other sect supported Xun. Thus, the latter sect was immediately persecuted by Yao.</p>

  <p>This sect possessed the saint spear of the Demon Night. All the previous generations of the Queen of Killings had used the saint spear from this sect, so this sect was also known as the 'Saint Spear Sect'.</p>

  <p>But now, the Saint Spear Sect was in a terrible situation in the Demon Night. Many of the sect members chose to hide, but some were forcibly enslaved by other sects. The men of the sect were treated as slaves while the beautiful women were treated as playthings.</p>

  <p>Hailey was the daughter of the leader of the Saint Spear Sect.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fight between the two queens, Hailey might have had a chance of becoming one of the Demon Night's ace talents.</p>

  <p>But now, Hailey was just a plaything without freedom in Malachi's harem.</p>

  <p>When Janet saw Luo Zheng's real name in the Corridor of Emperor, she became very curious about him.</p>

  <p>And when Hailey saw Luo Zheng's real name in the Corridor of Emperor, she became extremely excited.</p>

  <p>The news about Xun's matter had already spread far and wide throughout the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Hailey had never expected that Luo Luo Zheng would eventually help Xun get back her throne. His support for Xun had given the Saint Spear Sect a glimmer of hope. That was the only way that Hailey would be able to obtain freedom.</p>

  <p>When the news about Xun had first spread through the universe through the Roaring Token, the Saint Spear Sect members hadn't thought too much about it.</p>

  <p>From their point of view, it was impossible for Xun to defeat Yao.</p>

  <p>Just as Yao had said, Xun didn't even have the qualifications to fight against her.</p>

  <p>However, as things had progressed, Luo Luo Zheng had even managed to kill Gunter!</p>

  <p>Not only had he killed Gunter, but he had also killed three of the other Supreme Lords as well.</p>

  <p>Malachi was Gunter's son.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, whenever Hailey saw Malachi looking downcast, she was actually very happy in her heart!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Hailey had kept Luo Zheng's name in her mind.</p>

  <p>She knew that Luo Luo Zheng was regarded as the Saint Spear Sect's hope, and he was also her greatest hope.</p>

  <p>So of course, she was extremely happy when she encountered Luo Luo Zheng in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Despite her excitement, she managed to keep a calm facade. She didn't dare to say or do anything.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still not strong enough at the moment, and he needed to follow his own path. Hailey cautiously looked at Luo Luo Zheng as a hope, so she would never willingly disturb him.</p>

  <p>Even though she was very confident in Luo Zheng's strength, she didn't want him to be in trouble here because of her.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Hailey chose not to tell Luo Luo Zheng about such things, and just said that Malachi was Gunter's son.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't know Luo Zheng's personality.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng heard that Malachi was Gunter's son, a warm smile appeared on his face. He looked toward Malachi and asked, "So, you're Supreme Lord Gunter's son, right?"</p>

  <p>Malachi laughed proudly. "You finally know my identity, but it's too late now for you to regret it and escape. All five of you kneel down and let me kill you three times. I can consider letting you guys off after that!"</p>

  <p>Not far away, Coleman grinned with his arms folded. "There are six of us, not five. Don't you know how to count?"</p>

  <p>Even Coleman, who was a bit cowardly, was willing to support and help Hailey.</p>

  <p>Malachi snorted and looked toward Janet. "I don't have any other hobbies. I just like collecting beauties. This human beauty is also very attractive. If you can accompany me in this Illusion Battlefield, I will not kill you."</p>

  <p>Janet tilted her head, curling her lips. She did not retreat at all, but instead stared straight at Malachi and said, "Supreme Lord Gunter is just a low-rank Supreme Lord. If you want me to give you company, the Illusion Battlefield is not a suitable place. After all, we are just ethereal projections here, and I think you'll enjoy me much more in reality."</p>

  <p>"Where do you live? After leaving the battlefield, whenever I feel like having fun, I can look for you no matter how far away you are from me."</p>

  <p>Malachi lightly smiled as he stared at Janet's lips.</p>

  <p>Malachi naturally would not be willing to transcend countless supreme worlds just to find a beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>But in this Illusion Battlefield, most of the young warriors didn't want to lose their momentum. They wanted to win all the time, even in silly arguments with others.</p>

  <p>As long as this woman wasn't the daughter of a Supreme Lord, and was only a talent of an ordinary tenth-grade sacred place, it wouldn't be difficult for Malachi to take her away.</p>

  <p>"The Ji Clan," Janet said simply. After that, she flashed a charming smile at Malachi and continued, "Would you still dare to come? Forget your useless father; even if the Queen of Punishment herself brings you to the Ji Clan, would you dare to come and take me away?"</p>

  <p>Janet was indeed not the direct descendant of a Supreme Lord, but her status in the Ji Clan was second only to the two Ji Clan's ace talents.</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan was so powerful that no one in the universe would dare to go to the Ji Clan's place and recklessly take away a clan member.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Janet told him about her background, Malachi was shocked. He had never expected that the woman in front of him would be from the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>"Humph. I don't care where you came from. We are in the Illusion Battlefield now, and whoever is the strongest wins!" Malachi quickly changed the topic.</p>

  <p>However, Janet laughed at him. "You finally get the point. Why didn't you say such words earlier?"</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, she walked over and patted Luo Zheng's arm, which was as sturdy as a divine weapon. She smiled gently and said, "I'll be counting on you now!"</p>

  <p>This battle was unavoidable.</p>

  <p>The two teams moved out of the main city.</p>

  <p>At the same time, there were also a lot of other warriors behind them.</p>

  <p>These warriors didn't have the strength to fight with these talents, but they still had the right to stay and watch the fight.</p>

  <p>"Tit for tat! I never expected that that woman would be from the Ji Clan!"</p>

  <p>"So what if she's from the Ji Clan? She doesn't seem to be an ace talent of the Ji Clan..."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that woman intends to make a move. She seems to want that young man to take action. Who is he, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"No matter where the two of them are from, they'll be defeated and punished in the end. Malachi is the Demon Night's ace talent, and also Supreme Lord Gunter's son. His strength is unfathomable!"</p>

  <p>As all the warriors discussed the battle, Hailey looked very upset.</p>

  <p>She rarely commented on such things, and she didn't know what to do at this moment. She could only hope that Luo Luo Zheng would really be able to defeat Malachi.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had displayed extraordinary strength in the Hall of Causality and even tricked and killed an ace talent in the third hall, he hadn't relied solely on his strength to do it. Instead, he had taken advantage of the rules of the hall to kill that ace talent. Would he really be able to defeat an ace talent with his strength alone?</p>

  <p>Janet, Hailey, Jeffrey, Coleman, and Ansel stood atop the city wall.</p>

  <p>Malachi was the first one to leave the city. He stepped out of the city wall, and after taking a dozen steps, he turned around to look at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng had not left the city yet, he said, "Are you regretting it already? If you want to be known as a cowardly warrior, that's okay. If you continue to stay in the main city, I can't do anything to you."</p>

  <p>Although Malachi pretended to be generous, he was nervous that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't want to leave the city. If that was the case, then he'd have to say something to provoke Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The corner of Luo Zheng's mouth curled up slightly. "I have no regrets. I'm just waiting for something. If they do not come, perhaps it would be for the best!"</p>

  <p>"What are they?" Malachi asked curiously.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there were many small black dots floating over from both sides of the city wall.</p>

  <p>"Kof, kof, kof..."</p>

  <p>These were the few hundred small skulls. They were unable to enter the city, so they circled around the walls of the main city.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng was on the west side of the main city, they naturally gathered together and moved toward him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let out a sigh. It seemed that it would be difficult to shake off these small skulls. Even after leaving the Hall of Causality, they were still able to follow him out. He really didn't know how they managed to do it.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are these things?" Malachi was astonished as he stared at the skulls that were constantly moving.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng stepped out of the city wall, all the small skulls swarmed toward him, but he didn't flinch in the slightest. He grabbed a small skull in his hand and pointed it at Malachi, a sinister smile appearing on his face.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to know what these little skulls are. You only need to know that since I managed to kill your father, I can also torture you a few times..."</p>
