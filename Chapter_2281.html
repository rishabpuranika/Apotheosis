<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Shahn had gotten wind of news about the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>Anonymity aside, it was indeed a miracle to be able to obtain twenty-three consecutive wins in challenging warriors at higher levels.</p>

  <p>Only a few select people had been able to do this in the history of the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>"Even he is an anonymous man, it should be impossible for him to do what you just said." Shahn stretched out one hand, and an invisible power was condensed again. Then he threw it lightly, and the power began to rapidly disappear.</p>

  <p>Power had only been a description at the beginning. But after the activation of the Eight Path Platforms, it was transformed into pure energy and stored. An interruption of supply would mean the depletion of someone's power, and only by the Cross-world Theurgy would they able to extract power from their body, keeping the power from weakening.</p>

  <p>"A proving godly warrior and the Cross-world Theurgy? I can't believe it." Shahn shook his head.</p>

  <p>Across him, Yilia looked annoyed. "Have I ever lied to you?"</p>

  <p>"No," smiled Shahn. "But you are spewing nonsense."</p>

  <p>This earned him several punches from Yilia. "The shape of that sword was a little odd. Its handle resembled the Maitreya Buddha while the body looked like a wheel. And after it made contact with blood, the blood formed the word kill..."</p>

  <p>"Kill?" Shahn questioned, eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>"It's the Buddha Emperor Sword, the unique skill of the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan."</p>

  <p>Joy's Gods Killing Sword Array was famous in the divine land, plus, the shape of the Buddha Emperor Sword was very special. It was practically a giveaway.</p>

  <p>It dawned on the siblings at the same time. "The Han Clan!"</p>

  <p>"The anonymous man came from the Purple Soul Hall," Shahn said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! You're finally exposed!" Compared to Shahn's calm reaction, Yilia was excited.</p>

  <p>After defeating Yilia, Luo Zheng immediately chose the next opponent.</p>

  <p>The top warriors in the divine land were all gathered in the Floating Islands. Whatever method he used would be spread quickly.</p>

  <p>His next opponent was Sam Zhao, who ranked 176th.</p>

  <p>Like Yilia, he'd been elated to be chosen by Luo Zheng, however, his excitement did not last very long.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had absorbed the Five Elements Godly Way which Sam also cultivated. He tried to force Sam to use the theurgy beyond way, but Sam seemed to have cultivated the Godly Way step by step without inheriting any theurgy beyond way from his clan. So when Sam thought that he had the upper hand in the battle, Luo Zheng took out the Buddha Emperor Sword and killed him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Twenty four consecutive wins! Six hundred and ten thousand points!</p>

  <p>Nearly one hundred and fifty thousand points would be gained when he defeated a low-rank True God, almost as many points as one would get defeating a consummate True God. It was appalling.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned to his room, calm and at ease, and chose another name from the list.</p>

  <p>"Go on!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng challenged opponent after opponent, the low-rank True Gods of the Hall of True Gods gradually understood his strategy in choosing.</p>

  <p>When he was at the 96th place, he challenged Yilia who ranked 196th.</p>

  <p>Then at 76th place, he challenged Sam who ranked 176th, and at 57th, he battled the warrior who placed 157th. In short, Luo Zheng chose the lowest ranking warrior for every round.</p>

  <p>While definitely a good strategy, the low-rank True Gods who ranked higher than Luo Zheng were only disappointed as their chances of getting picked by Luo Zheng were slim to none.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng won three more battles and now had twenty-seven consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>In the history of the Arena of Legends, twenty-seven consecutive wins was the highest record a warrior made in battling higher leveled warriors.</p>

  <p>It had been forty divine eras since, but now, Luo Zheng was about to break that record.</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the Hall of True Gods, the spectators were slowly beginning to understand the new abilities that the anonymous man demonstrated.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it's the Buddha Emperor Sword!"</p>

  <p>"The unique skill of the Demi-holy Being from the Han Clan, the killing sword in the Gods Killing Sword Array."</p>

  <p>"Not anyone can make the Gods Killing Sword Array extraordinary, because using the real swords can't be considered the top theurgy. Only with one's own strength to condense the illusory swords can the warrior be considered strong. But he's just a proving godly warrior, how could he do that without the Cross-world Theurgy?"</p>

  <p>"He did use the Cross-world Theurgy to activate the Power Shaping and make the illusory sword."</p>

  <p>"Stop talking nonsense. How could a proving godly warrior use the theurgy which could only be used by a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's use of the Buddha Emperor Sword had stirred up the crowd.</p>

  <p>The True Gods who could make it into the top two hundred were trained in the key techniques of each wealthy clan. Some of them belonged to the direct line of descent like Yilia and enjoyed high status.</p>

  <p>They had confirmed that Luo Zheng came from the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>The martial artists who cultivated the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way were not all from the Purple Soul Hall of the Han Clan, but it was only Joy who mastered the Gods Killing Sword Array. Such speculation was not difficult to make.</p>

  <p>The problem was about the Cross-world Theurgy. In the eyes of the True Gods, this incredible theurgy could only be owned by Holy Beings. It was impossible for it to appear in the hands of a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>What happened was beyond their understanding.</p>

  <p>This caused a drift within the people. Some believed it with confidence while others didn't take to it at all.</p>

  <p>As the people argued, Luo Zheng stepped forward.</p>

  <p>Twenty eight consecutive wins...</p>

  <p>Twenty nine consecutive wins...</p>

  <p>Thirty consecutive wins...</p>

  <p>The points were now up to one million and four hundred thousand. He had already surpassed the top-rank True Gods and even some consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Now was where the situation became slightly different.</p>

  <p>Many wealthy clans did not like this anonymous man. Luo Zheng earned a lot of points like this. It didn't matter which clan he belonged to as it would always affect the results of several ranks. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do about it.</p>

  <p>Thirty consecutive wins later, Luo Zheng stood at 17th place. But this time, he strayed from his strategy and chose a random battle.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, he was matched with Quentin Qin.</p>

  <p>When Quentin entered the Arena of Legends, he was a bit overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>He initially ranked 21st but after winning a battle two days ago, he now stood at 19th place. He was also eager to challenge the anonymous man, but from the previous choices of this anonymous man, the person in a lower place was to be picked.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to him that he'd encounter this anonymous man in a random battle.</p>

  <p>Quentin had been defeated by Luo Zheng in the past when they were in the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, however, after the disciples of the wealthy clans became low-rank True Gods, their strength would be enhanced greatly.</p>

  <p>Besides, a member of the direct line of a wealthy clan like Quentin was often able to cultivate the best theurgies beyond way. Their combat strength was naturally far more superior to that of the ordinary True Gods, and with Quentin's own talent, he had easily stepped into the top 20.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no interest in being in a tangle with Quentin. In the previous battles, Luo Zheng had taken the initiative to attack. If his opponent displayed the Godly Way or theurgy beyond way that he lacked, he would activate the Infinity Ruler to absorb it. And if he didn't need it, he would simply kill his opponent. Though he had inherited the Gods Killing Sword Array from Joy, he hadn't even used the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way as control of the Buddha Emperor Sword did not call for it.</p>

  <p>Before Quentin could say anything, Luo Zheng had rushed towards him with the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>Quentin had improved his strength a lot. At the very least, he wouldn't be defeated like he was last time. After all, his cultivation base was a great realm higher than Zheng's. After activating his Godly Tile, he had indeed displayed a powerful theurgy.</p>

  <p>He was able to control the invisible Buddha Emperor Sword by using the Green Wood Godly Way to make special willows.</p>

  <p>With the Buddha Emperor Sword restrained, Luo Zheng took out the Heavenly Tooth Sword without hesitation.</p>

  <p>If the Buddha Emperor Sword was used to kill, the Heavenly Tooth Sword was mainly used to hunt, which would usually bring destruction upon the opponent. Under the hunt of the Heavenly Tooth Sword, Quentin's defense was instantly broken.</p>

  <p>However, before any more damage could be inflicted, Quentin suddenly shouted, "Wait! I still have something to say."</p>

  <p>The two swords immediately halted in front of Quentin. Luo Zheng frowned, curious at the sudden interruption. Warriors in the Arena of Legends didn't really die, so his opponent wouldn't beg for mercy, would he?</p>

  <p>"I wanted to tell you at the start. You didn't even give me a chance,"</p>

  <p>Quentin said gloomily. "Someone requested me to tell you to go out of your room and meet with her in the Hall of True Gods."</p>

  <p>It turned out, Luo Zheng never left his room. The people in the Hall of True Gods didn't have the chance to talk to him and could only send him messages this way. However, Luo Zheng immediately fought Quentin as soon as they met, never giving him the chance to speak.</p>

  <p>For Quentin, losing to Luo Zheng was not a big deal. But it was certainly a huge deal if he couldn't relay the message successfully.</p>

  <p>"The person who asked you to pass the message was sure that I will challenge you?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Quentin answered. "But she did inform the top one hundred and thirty True Gods from whom you might choose one."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>The True Gods at the top of the rankings all had extraordinary backgrounds. Most of them were direct descendants of wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>Who had the influence to do so?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chewed on his lip. Even if Ling Shuang ranked first, it was still impossible for her to do that, wasn't it?</p>
