<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This wasn't the first time Zheng had seen something with three heads and six arms.</p>

  <p>The shadow formed by the stream of brown Wild God Power was obscure but Zheng was certain that this wild bone contained Chiyou's bloodline.</p>

  <p>Finding this wild bone was a good thing but Zheng still had some concerns.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, he changed his blood in order to avoid being punished by the Ruling Slate. He didn't know if doing so would also affect his absorption of the blood wild bone's power.</p>

  <p>The only way to find out was to give it a try.</p>

  <p>It was not suitable to refine the Wild God Power in the Immemorial Wilderness so Zheng had to put away this blood wild bone in his space ring for the meantime.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he heard a clamor of footsteps approaching.</p>

  <p>Zheng jumped from the hole and saw smoke billowing in the distance. At the same time, he saw countless Wights running away from the smoke.</p>

  <p>These Wights were on all-fours and were currently rushing towards Zheng at a surprisingly fast rate.</p>

  <p>"These Wights... Are they crazy?"</p>

  <p>Sarah exclaimed, her face filled with astonishment as she watched this scene.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods who often explored the Immemorial Wilderness knew of the large number of Wights that resided here.</p>

  <p>Once, the entire population of Wights was wiped out by a great force.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a large number of Wights appeared in the Immemorial Wilderness all over again. There was simply no way of getting rid of them.</p>

  <p>The strangest thing was that nobody knew where these Wights came from.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the strength of these creatures was ordinary and not much of a threat against the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>However, seeing them rush over in such large numbers was strange.</p>

  <p>Something must be wrong.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here, all of you!" Hiram shouted, waving his thousand-footlong rake.</p>

  <p>"Phew..."</p>

  <p>The rake hit hundreds of Wights, turning them into broken corpses.</p>

  <p>This bloody scene made Zheng frown.</p>

  <p>He did not feel any ill intent from these Wights. On the contrary, it seemed as if they were merely escaping from something.</p>

  <p>Just as this thought flashed through his mind, a figure, ten thousand feet long, appeared in the smoke. The figure moved across the smoke and fell towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a huge giant, equivalent to a huge mountain and it was about to crash down upon him!</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were wide open. He soared into the air and narrowly avoided the giant.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The giant smashed onto the ground and glided quite a distance, leaving a ditch that was a thousand feet deep in his wake.</p>

  <p>"It is Romeo!"</p>

  <p>Zheng hovered in the sky and clearly saw the giant's features. It had two giant heads and four arms but the two faces were the same as Romeo's.</p>

  <p>However, Romeo's huge body was currently covered in scars.</p>

  <p>"Is it actually Romeo?" Sarah asked, eyes still filled with shock.</p>

  <p>"Who has such a huge amount of strength to hurt Romeo?" Hiram mused, his eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Amos' face also darkened as he looked at the billowing smoke in the distance. He could make out three huge figures, each one over ten-thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>As the figures emerged from the smoke, they saw that they were three giants that glowed with golden light.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Amos', Sarah's, and Hiram's faces all paled.</p>

  <p>They had been digging for wild bones in this area for years and knew well enough that this golden light was a special bloodline theurgy of the Yellow Emperor race!</p>

  <p>Amos had been so careful in avoiding these powerful warriors since they had already killed a countless number of Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Romeo was badly injured upon fighting all these three great opponents.</p>

  <p>If they were to get involved, they would definitely die!</p>

  <p>"Give up, Romeo! You won't escape this Immemorial Wilderness this time," the middle-aged man at the helm announced.</p>

  <p>Romeo was on the ground but he stood up and wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth. "Do you not fear the Nine Li race? Do you not fear us waging a war?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man burst into laughter. "War? It seems you've overestimated yourself, Romeo! You're only one of the many mid-rank Wild Gods in the Nine Li race. Do you honestly think they'll wage a war because of you?"</p>

  <p>The situation of the world right now was extremely delicate.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Snake Goddess race, the Yellow Emperor race, and the Nine Li race, the Emperor Charm race was also eager to make its move.</p>

  <p>The strong warriors of each race hid in the bone towers and rarely caused any commotion.</p>

  <p>Romeo was indeed an outstanding warrior but his death was not enough to warrant a declaration of war from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this area of the Immemorial Wilderness was the training ground for the Nine Li race's and the Yellow Emperor race's warriors.</p>

  <p>Dying here was very common.</p>

  <p>When Romeo heard this, his eyes showed a trace of despair. It seemed he was fated to die here.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man's face was filled with confidence in his victory. He swept his gaze over Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>Amos, Sarah, and Hiram all trembled in fear. They wanted to find an opportunity to run away and were unwilling to get involved in the dispute between the two races. Would they let them go?</p>

  <p>Zheng firmly stood in midair, pondering the situation.</p>

  <p>He didn't know the Nine Li race's origin but he thought of the golden Chiyou statue in the palace of the sun and assumed that Romeo and he should belong to the same race.</p>

  <p>If he saved Romeo, that meant getting the chance of probably joining the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>However, the strength of the three Wild Gods of the Yellow Emperor race was great and it would mean taking a great risk to fight them.</p>

  <p>"Bilaal, you go and kill those irrelevant vermin. Tyreke and I will finish off Romeo," the middle-aged man instructed.</p>

  <p>As soon as he said this, Amos, Sarah, and Hiram understood that they had been handed down their death sentences.</p>

  <p>However, they weren't going to sit here and wait to get killed. The three of them quickly rose in size, turning into seven or eight thousand feet tall giants. They were going to go all out to fight for their lives.</p>

  <p id="top_14">Zheng still hadn't activated his Wild God Power. He, instead, used chaotic energy to send Romeo, Sarah, Hiram, and Amos a voice message.</p>

  <p>"Romeo, try to delay those two men while I suppress Bilaal with soul force. The rest of you, work together and kill him. As long as we eliminate one of them, everything will be easier."</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on everyone's face when they heard Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors in this world mainly cultivated Wild God Power, largely because of the environment they were in.</p>

  <p>Because of this, all Wild Gods had one shortcoming: their souls weren't strong enough.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, everyone's soul was about at the same level so it wasn't a determining factor in fighting against their opponents.</p>

  <p>When Zheng told them that he intended to suppress Bilaal with his soul force, they couldn't believe their ears.</p>

  <p>However, there was no time to think about it.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man and Tyreke were already rushing towards Romeo.</p>

  <p>Without so much as a thought, Romeo chose to retreat.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Bilaal also rushed towards Hiram like a strong beast, face red with excitement.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who still hadn't activated his Wild God Power, was ignored by Bilaal as if he was a mere mosquito.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of this, Zheng flew high up into the air. He narrowed his eyes and two rays of light on the Shadow Bearing Sword began to flash.</p>

  <p>He sent a message through his chaotic energy once again. "Now is the time. Attack!"</p>
