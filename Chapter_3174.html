  <p>
</p>

  <p>From where Konnor and the other elites from the Heart Flow Sect sat, they were able to spot the embarrassed faces of Hare and the others. The sight made them chuckle among themselves.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect belonged to the Taiyi Mountain. However, these two always acted against the Heart Flow Sect as if they didn't take it as part of the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng had performed so well in front of them that Konnor and his friends felt extremely proud to be on the same side as him.</p>

  <p>"Konnor! Why are you laughing?" Hare asked Konnor who had a goofy smile on his face. However, unlike Konnor, Hare had a deep frown on his face.</p>

  <p>Konnor shrugged his shoulders and said, "I just find it funny that some people were victimized by their own explosives."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die?" Hare furrowed his brows deeper and anger clouded his vision.</p>

  <p>Konnor sighed calmly. "If you want to fight, now's not a good time. Let's arrange it for next time."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Konnor was not at all afraid of the people in front of him.</p>

  <p>His cultivation base and the Other Shore Token were considered to be remarkable among the disciples across all three sword sects. He was only inferior to Luo Zheng and Milo in terms of potential.</p>

  <p>Konnor's impressive performance earlier pushed Hare into resignation. He snorted and leaned against the mountain wall as he cursed Konnor in his heart.</p>

  <p>In the previous Seven Mountains Meeting, Milo ranked first against the others. Without Milo, Hare thought they finally had the chance to bully the Heart Flow Sect into defeat. Then, Luo Zheng appeared and ruined his ambitions.</p>

  <p>He was even more powerful than Milo.</p>

  <p>The disciples' faces perked up in unison. They all watched as the giant stone of the Heart Flow Sect rushed towards that of the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>"This looks like trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Marco might reach a bad end as well!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng finished with the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect, the giant stone suddenly pivoted and moved in reverse at full speed.</p>

  <p>Marco had troubled Luo Zheng too many times already. Luo Zheng didn't want to let him go.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't plan on exposing the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent's follow-up words, but he felt that Qiu Yinhe already knew that he borrowed the yellow paper in the Truth Library.</p>

  <p>Now that action had been done, he focused on defeating Marco and eliminating him from the competition.</p>

  <p>The members of the Vastness Mountain watched in horror as the giant stone of the Heart Flow Sect turned around.</p>

  <p>"He's coming!"</p>

  <p>"Do we have time to dodge? It's too fast!"</p>

  <p>"Marco! What should we do?"</p>

  <p>Marco's face darkened. He wasn't prepared for that situation at all.</p>

  <p>Marco realized just how much he underestimated Luo Zheng. It was Luo Zheng, after all, who had manipulated the giant stone. He must have had an almost perfect compatibility with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to blow Marco's mind. Even a master capable of Instant Enlightenment wasn't as capable as him.</p>

  <p>No one was able to explain Luo Zheng's extraordinary power. Marco wanted to dwell on this more, but he had to rush out and avoid a deadly counterattack.</p>

  <p>There was no way they could get out of this. Marco shouted, "Rhys! Help me control it!"</p>

  <p>Then, he stepped abruptly on the third rune and an enchanted barrier appeared.</p>

  <p>Marco wasn't capable of Instant Enlightenment, but he was almost perfectly compatible with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Stepping on the rune, he triggered the appearance of a thick enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"Dang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's giant stone collapsed right smack into the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>However, the enchanted barrier remained standing.</p>

  <p>The giant stone and the enchanted barrier brought Marco and his group down towards the ground. Then, the giant stone bounced up like a ball, thanks to the strong barrier.</p>

  <p>"You're doing very well. But how long can you keep this up?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked calm. With a simple flick of his wrist, he controlled the giant stone into flying towards the Vastness Mountain's giant stone.</p>

  <p>Marco clenched his teeth and activated his truth aura. The enchanted barrier, which looked dim, started to regain its heavenly aura.</p>

  <p>"Dang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's stone smashed against the barrier again, this time with more power.</p>

  <p>Before the Vastness Mountain's stone landed on the ground, the enchanted barrier pressed against the ground. One elite disciple from the Vastness Mountain reacted a little too late and hit his head. The impact was so powerful that he immediately fainted.</p>

  <p>Even then, the stone didn't touch the ground as it bounced back furiously into the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng attempted the third time and Marco was no longer able to hold on. The giant stone fell down from the sky and, with a dispirited expression, he announced resignation. "Let's give up," he said.</p>

  <p>He kicked his feet and left the stone.</p>

  <p>During the fierce battle, the rest of the people from the Vastness Mountain also struggled to hold on. They were afraid that they would be seriously injured with such violent collisions. However, they didn't have the nerve to give up since they saw Marco still tried his best to resist.</p>

  <p>So when Marco announced resignation, they slowly broke away from the giant stone and let it crash towards the ground.</p>

  <p>The Vastness Mountain was out.</p>

  <p>Marco stood in midair with his fists clenched. He was seething with rage.</p>

  <p>Marco was known to be a man of pride and ego. He wouldn't let Luo Zheng humiliate him over and over again. If it weren't for Tacy and the other warriors from the Land of Sword Grief, he would've killed Luo Zheng without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Golden Mountain, the Azure Mountain, the Bright Mountain, the Vastness Mountain, the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect were defeated and eliminated one by one.</p>

  <p>Only Feng Ge, the Origin Mountain, the Ivory Mountain and the Heart Flow Sect remained in the competition.</p>

  <p>At the start, members of the Ivory Mountain attempted to stop Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>After that, they decided to focus on evading the opponents. They had a very slim chance at winning.</p>

  <p>The more dramatic the tension among the ten sword sects grew, the longer the competition lasted. In the previous Seven Mountains Meeting, eight sword sects were eliminated, and only the first and the second places were occupied. There was no third place at all.</p>

  <p>The Ivory Mountain's members decided to simply stand by the corners and watch others fight each other. That way, they had higher chances of snagging at least the third place.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng fought Marco, the giant stone of the Ivory Mountain moved to the side of the metal mountain and started to absorb the weight rune.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the stone absorbed half the rune, Luo Zheng started hovering over them. Seeing this, the Ivory Mountain's members quietly slipped away.</p>

  <p>Other warriors in the audience saw this and laughed in mockery.</p>

  <p>"How cunning Whitlock is!"</p>

  <p>"As long as one more team is eliminated, they can secure third place without even doing anything!"</p>

  <p>"I wish we did the same!"</p>

  <p>Aside from Marco, Hare and some others who looked morose, most of the people who were eliminated were in a good mood. Although they had lost the opportunity to win the reward, there was not a life and death battle in the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaned his stone against the side of the metal mountain. He began to fuse the weight rune with the stone. Sounds erupted above him. He looked up and frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was sitting on the stone. Her pretty face looked aloof. She looked calm and still as the stone collided with the Origin Mountain's stone.</p>

  <p>Behind her, 19 people stood. However, only 12 members of the Origin Mountain remained. They were at a disadvantage. Feng Ge relentlessly collided her stone with the Origin Mountain's stone.</p>
