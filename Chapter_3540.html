<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The stronghold of the Pear Hill was very safe, as far as Yan and Natalie knew.</p>

  <p>It had been a while since they entered the Desire World. Since they had no need to enter the Myriad Spirits City, they never got the chance to come into contact with any of the rather rebellious races on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>All the races in the small town were relatively gentle and peace-keeping.</p>

  <p>They also treated the Souls of Light of the Pear Hill as equals.</p>

  <p>When Yan and Natalie saw the Star Falcons, they were a little worried about their aggressiveness, but never did they expect them to kill Naomi instantly.</p>

  <p>Their senior's death was far too much for the two. Instead of feeling scared, they were terribly heartbroken.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Yan stared blankly at the dispersing Soul of Light, unable to do a thing.</p>

  <p>A Star Falcon dashed into the Pear Hill's stronghold and examined the area, finding a few bold members of the Pear Hill standing in the corner.</p>

  <p>"We don't wish to kill anyone," he said. "Yan Luo is all we want— this has nothing to do with the people of the Pear Hill. Where is she?"</p>

  <p>Still processing the situation, Yan was about to answer on instinct, but Natalie stepped forward before she could and claimed the name. "I am Yan Luo."</p>

  <p>Natalie didn't want to take the risk.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon gave no reason for wanting Yan, but she couldn't let them take her away.</p>

  <p>Behind her, Yan was stunned speechless.</p>

  <p id="top_12">Surprisingly, the Star Falcon took one look at Natalie and burst into booming laughter. "Take these two away!"</p>

  <p>Once the Star Falcon left the stronghold, two wings came in from the outside. Yan and Natalie were taken to the back of a Star Falcon.</p>

  <p>And so the six Star Falcons flew into the air and left the small town.</p>

  <p>Watching their figures receding in the distance, Whitehead from the White Ape race finally sighed deeply in relief.</p>

  <p>He still felt guilt, but he had always believed that what he did was for the sake of the White Ape race.</p>

  <p>By the time the Star Falcon race completed the plan, the White Ape race could return to the Sky Water City and restore their previous glory with the Star Falcons' support. By then, Whitehead would be considered a hero.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race is closely related to the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>Do you know who we are? Do you want the Pear Hill to annihilate the Sun Crow race?"</p>

  <p>With piercing eyes, Natalie threatened the Star Falcon from atop his back.</p>

  <p>While the Sun Crow race was also considered a super force, they weren't quite strong enough to fight against the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>But no matter what threats Natalie spewed, the Star Falcons didn't seem to pay her any mind. They remained silent throughout the entire journey.</p>

  <p>Soon, they reached the edge of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"It's the Dark Region!" Natalie cried out when she saw the vast darkness.</p>

  <p>Yan raised her head to take a look. By then, she was still numb with sorrow— she couldn't accept Naomi's death.</p>

  <p>When she was in Stage Thirteen, Yan had seen the Dark Region, but never had she entered it, nor did she know much about it. The area was a complete mystery to her. Even the Souls of Light and the creatures on the Other Shore believed they'd surely die if they entered it.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the edge of the Dark Region, the Star Falcons flew down.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Natalie asked, this time, a little more helpless and wary.</p>

  <p>"We'll take you into the Dark Region," said a Star Falcon plainly.</p>

  <p>"Enter the Dark Region? If you want to kill us, just do it. Why bother sending us in there?" There was some panic in Natalie's voice. She knew that if they entered the Dark Region, they wouldn't come out alive.</p>

  <p>Not bothering to say any more, the Star Falcon flapped his wings, materializing two fruits.</p>

  <p>"Swallow them! Absorb them into your souls! With these, you'll survive in the Dark Region," ordered the Star Falcon.</p>

  <p>Initially, Natalie had planned to resist. But thinking of the boundless Dark Region, she figured she had to compromise.</p>

  <p>Yan, however, didn't resist at all.</p>

  <p>Once the two of them integrated the Darkness Fruits into their souls, they found the Dark Region not as dark as it once was. Their eyes widened as they realized that they could actually see its interior.</p>

  <p>As the Dark Region grew clearer, Nathalie screamed— several black monkeys were staring straight at the girls, crowded together near the edge of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Head inside!"</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon waved his great wings, and Natalie dashed into the Dark Region, Yan stumbling behind.</p>

  <p>Because they didn't eat the Darkness Fruit, the six Star Falcons couldn't see anything in the Dark Region. But that didn't matter much— they only needed to send Yan into the appointed place.</p>

  <p>"We must now inform that man in the Myriad Spirits City…" one of the Star Falcons said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcons couldn't deny how deep their hatred was for Zheng. They wanted to chop him to pieces.</p>

  <p>But both Garth and their leader had been killed by Zheng— they understood that they were no match for him.</p>

  <p>"Who will do it?" he asked once again.</p>

  <p>They were aware that Yan was Zheng's sister. If Zheng knew that Yan was in their hands, the one who went to him as a messenger would be risking getting killed.</p>

  <p>"I'll go," said the shortest Star Falcon.</p>

  <p>Their race had reached a dead end. Now, all they could do was sacrifice themselves in desperation.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The starry gems in the Star Falcons' chests flickered with brilliant lights.</p>

  <p>"May the starlight be with you."</p>

  <p>"May the starlight be with you."</p>

  <p>Once the Star Falcons sent out their blessings, the shortest one flew toward the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had been stuck in a coma for an entire day and night before she opened her eyes. She struggled to open her eyes, looking haggard.</p>

  <p>Naturally, it took great energy to activate the crack in the light. Even the most powerful purified beings couldn't do it as they pleased.</p>

  <p>Just as Feng Ge was struggling to get up, a pair of hands gently held her shoulders down before she heard Zheng's voice. "Don't move. You just woke up. You're exhausted. You have to have a proper rest."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's lips quirked up as she heard the guilt in Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>The moment was rather enjoyable on her end— she was hoping Zheng could owe her even more in the future.</p>

  <p>Before Feng Ge could say anything, a Guide Weasel burst in. "Sir, I have something to report!"</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Feng Ge frowned at the news. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"A Star Falcon has descended outside the City Guard House. He's requesting to see you," replied the Guide Weasel.</p>

  <p>"A Star Falcon asked to see me?" Zheng was stunned. Was the Star Falcon race ready to admit defeat?</p>

  <p>Since it had come to this, it was meaningless to admit defeat. Even if Zheng wanted to merely let go of the Star Falcon race, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race weren't about to let them off so easily.</p>

  <p>But Zheng went straight to the gate anyway.</p>

  <p>Standing at the gate was the Star Falcon. Seeing Zheng, he said, "Your sister, Yan, has been sent to the Dark Region."</p>
