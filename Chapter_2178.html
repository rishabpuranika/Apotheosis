  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Why?" Seth smiled faintly. He then explained in a warm tone. "Don't you understand? It's both a fortune and misfortune to be born in Han Clan. Everything you have was given by Han Clan, and they have the right to take them away, unless?"</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" Zane's expression darkened. He didn't want to believe Seth, but he had no choice but to admit that Seth's words were reasonable.</p>

  <p>Seth continued to smile and said, "Unless you can display more powerful strength and better talent than Tianxing. If you could do that, you should be able to attract the attention of the main Han Clan. Isn't it very simple?"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Is it simple?" Zane cursed. Right now, he could only wish that Luo Luo Zheng was a swindler and he had used some trick to intentionally shatter that White Jade Token. However, Zane also knew that it was just an empty wish on his part. Deep in his heart, he feared that Luo Luo Zheng was truly more powerful than him.</p>

  <p>Zane was not the only one who was jealous of Luo Luo Zheng. All the proving godly warriors present saw that Luo Luo Zheng had broken the White Jade Token.</p>

  <p>Not only was he not kicked out, but Luo Luo Zheng was instead given a pair of supreme primordial weapons by the master of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Envy was apparent in the eyes of the proving godly warriors present.</p>

  <p>They felt extremely aggrieved in their hearts ?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not decline. Since he had already decided to join the Han Clan, he would not be too estranged from the Han Clan. He happily accepted the pair of short halberds. Before he threw one of them, he looked at Malloy and asked, "How do you know that I'm a sword cultivator?"</p>

  <p>He didn't display his swordsmanship in front of Malloy. The Great Weighty Sword was also in its sheath and was kept in his space ring.</p>

  <p>There was no apparent evidence that he used a sword.</p>

  <p>Malloy smiled faintly. "I can see that the part between your thumb and index of your right hand is sunken and your index finger is rough. It could only be seen on those who have cultivated the sword for many years." As the master of the Heavenly Han House, Malloy himself was at the peak level of a mid-rank True God. As such, it was not difficult for him to observe those details. His keen observation impressed many of those who heard his remark.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head slightly. When the pair of short halberds entered his hands, they gave off an ice-cold feeling akin to pig iron. The halberds weighed twice as much as the White Jade Token. But because they were heavier, it was easier to throw. So there was not much difference.</p>

  <p>After that, Malloy waved his hand and smiled. "You can start."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grabbed onto one of the short halberds and took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>Once again, he raised his head high, and the nine stars in his inner world continued to spin. Power radiated from the nine stars, like an engine ready to start a powerful machine. The strength source from the surface of the stars began to flow along the pathways in his cinnabar field and entered his right hand. Still, he had only extracted thirty percent of the strength source.</p>

  <p>After he took a deep breath, Luo Luo Zheng threw the short halberd in his hand.</p>

  <p>With fantastic speed, the short halberd flew!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>There was no energy attached to that short halberd, only pure strength.</p>

  <p>However, the short halberd shot up into the sky at an unprecedented speed. With great momentum, it tore through the air as it produced a high-pitched sound. Everyone's gaze was focused on the short halberd Because the speed of the halberd was too fast, it caused the air around it to constantly shrink. As such, a pale white trajectory was formed below it.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the short halberd had risen to a height of five hundred feet!</p>

  <p>"The speed is so fast!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he'll break the record!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that the master thinks very highly of this kid, so that's why he gave him the short halberds?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of proving godly warriors present widened as they watched the short black halberd rise up in a straight line. A mix of amazement and jealousy was seen in their faces.</p>

  <p>After it reached a height of five hundred feet, the black halberd, just like the other one hundred thousand White Jade Tokens, encountered that giant invisible net. As such, it began to quickly slow down.</p>

  <p>However, the initial speed of the short halberd was simply too fast. Even though its speed had been greatly reduced, it still rose at a spectacular speed.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he can break Zane's?" A proving godly warrior had intended to say that he wanted to see if Luo Luo Zheng could break Zane's record.</p>

  <p>However, before he could finish his words, the short halberd had already passed the 800 feet mark and flew straight towards the 900 feet mark?</p>

  <p>"The highest record in the Heavenly Han House is only 820 feet. He's planning to break through the 900 feet mark!"</p>

  <p>"It has already broken through the 900 feet mark, and I think it will soon break through 1000 feet."</p>

  <p>A disciple of the Han Clan chuckled as he heard this, "Breaking through the 1000 feet mark? How absurd! That would be impossible! The binding power in the sky above the Heavenly Han House was created according to the rules of the Thousand Commandments Slate. Generally, the highest point is only 990 feet! No matter how powerful Tianxing is, would he be able to break the rules of the Thousand Commandments Slate? Even a top-rank True God would find it hard to get rid of this binding force!"</p>

  <p>What the warrior said was the truth. The sub-branches of the Han Clan controlled the Thousand Commandments Slate in this area, and the rules were all written by them. As such, the rules naturally favored Heavenly Han House. As for the other proving godly houses in the Six-Burden Divine City, they could not enjoy any special treatment.</p>

  <p>But after the short halberd broke through the 900 feet mark, it still easily rose upwards. After a few moments, it reached a height of 990 feet!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The black halberd seemed to have hit something hard before it stopped.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gaze was high up in the sky, focused on the motionless black halberd.</p>

  <p>    </p>
