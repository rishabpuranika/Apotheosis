<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1163 The Master Of The Black Star </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Every one of these divine-level talents was openly staring at Luo Luo Zheng. They could hardly hide the greed in their eyes. But remembering the corpses lying in the crater vividly as if they were implanted in their minds, they held themselves in check.</p>

  <p>Stealing the pickax in Luo Zheng's hand? That was not taking a risk at all. But instead, that was pure suicide!</p>

  <p>Thus everyone decided that they could only keep a certain distance from him and watch from afar.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quietly observed the Black Star in his hand. It was short in length, almost looking like a small hammer. He tried gauging its weight as he scanned its body for any markings. But no matter what he did, he still couldn't figure out why it ranked as a supreme divine weapon. He was completely clueless.</p>

  <p>'Does this pickax need life vitality to activate?'</p>

  <p>A strand of life vitality abruptly appeared in Luo Zheng's hand as he thought of this, and he poured it eagerly into the pickax.</p>

  <p>Fundamentally, life vitality could easily invade a weapon. But he could faintly feel that this pickax was extremely resistant to life vitality.</p>

  <p>'I should use my perception to explore it.'</p>

  <p>Then he started utilizing his spiritual perception to scrutinize the divine weapon. But every time he came into contact with the Black Star, he was also being blocked out by an invisible force.</p>

  <p>'Do I need to put a drop of my blood onto it so that I'll become its master?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blinked his eyes as he mused what to do next. Then he suddenly flicked his finger, causing a drop of blood to spurt out. He aimed it immediately at the pickax, but it missed, falling to its side. It seemed to him that the weapon had some invisible force, not allowing the blood to touch its surface.</p>

  <p>"What?" he cried out, confused.</p>

  <p>Inspecting the Black Star thoroughly, he couldn't help feeling as if he had entered a mountain of treasures but left empty-handed. There was nothing he could do about it.</p>

  <p>Sighing helplessly, he casually gazed at the divine-level talents in the distance. No one dared to approach him at this time, and he couldn't count on a method from their mouths.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was at a loss, a faint voice resounded in his mind, "Ha-ha!</p>

  <p>Black Star. This is a supreme divine weapon. I knew that it was buried in the Earth Tree, but I didn't expect you to actually take it out." It was the voice of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>"You're awake!" Surprise appeared on Luo Zheng's face. He had initially thought that the cyan dragon would be sleeping for a long time.</p>

  <p>"I sensed this supreme divine weapon, so I woke up," said the cyan dragon in a voice that revealed a hint of exhaustion.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was in frustration. But a sudden realization hit him as he listened to the cyan dragon's words. It seemed like he knew a lot about this mine as well as the Black Star. Glee was written all over Luo Zheng's face as he said, "I don't seem to be able to use this pickax."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon chuckled heartily and replied, "It will be strange if you can use a supreme divine weapon as soon as you obtain it!"</p>

  <p>"Then what should I do?" Luo Luo Zheng asked quickly.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Lineage Human was a branch of the Genuine Dragon, and the members were half-dragon and half-human. The cyan dragon was one of the super legendary beasts of the Genuine Dragon World, making him a Genuine Dragon. If even he did not know how to use the Black Star, then it would be even more impossible for the others to know.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you how to become its master," the cyan dragon assured him in a relaxed manner.</p>

  <p>"Is it easy?" Luo Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>"If you follow my instructions, it won't be too hard," the cyan dragon reassured.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng heaved a long sigh of relief at the cyan dragon's words. He was currently in the territory of the four divine kingdoms. And according to Randy, those Soul Sea Realm masters still had to come to the Feather Emperor Secret Land to catch mineral-devouring bugs in the hope of taking the Soul Cores from them. If he couldn't become the master of the Black Star, those emperors would definitely take it away from him.</p>

  <p>"Do you see the three divine textures on the pickax?" the cyan dragon probed. "As long as you activate these three ten-star divine textures, you will be able to become the master of the Black Star."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. The three ten-star divine textures on the Black Star had no relation to the human race? they were passed down by the Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>Before this, Luo Luo Zheng had also thought of the possibility of becoming the pickax's master by activating the three ten-star divine textures. That was why he earnestly tried to pour his life vitality into the Black Star.</p>

  <p>However, the pickax didn't have the slightest reaction. Luo Luo Zheng had no other choice but to feel defeated at that time.</p>

  <p>"All you need to do is draw these divine textures in the opposite order," the cyan dragon confided with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Draw these divine textures in the opposite order?" Astonishment appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he queried, "It can't be that they're also ten-star divine textures, right?"</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current soul force, he could only draw five-star divine textures at the most. And drawing a six-star divine texture was already hard on his part. What more for a ten-star divine texture? He didn't even dare to think about it.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon replied blandly, "Ha-ha! If they were all ten-star divine textures, there probably aren't many living beings in this world that could become the master of the Black Star. Imagine it yourself. You'll understand once you draw these divine textures in the opposite order."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Luo Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow, and the three ten-star divine textures entered his vision.</p>

  <p>After that, a look of amazement appeared on his face. "These are actually three one-star divine textures when being drawn in the opposite order.</p>

  <p>And they are the meditation divine textures I used in practice when I started cultivating divine textures!"</p>

  <p>The reverse version of the ten-star divine textures was surprisingly three one-star divine textures.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no idea if this was a coincidence, or if the runic expert who designed these divine textures was doing it on purpose.</p>

  <p>"Yes! However, there are too few people who know of this secret. Even if someone took the pickax away, it would be impossible for him to become its master as he didn't know the secrets behind it," the cyan dragon remarked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, and then hastily said, "I got it. I'll do it now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't wait any longer as excitement burst within him. Grabbing the pickax, he swept his gaze at the warriors around. When he was sure that everyone's eyes were focused on him, he laughed coldly as he suddenly swung the pickax, smashing it down towards the ground.</p>

  <p>The hardness of the Black Star was seemingly quite not ordinary, considering that he was not yet its master. He swiftly jumped into the pit he dug in the ground as he released his life vitality to cover his surroundings.</p>

  <p>He only needed three one-star divine textures to unravel the ten-star divine textures on the Black Star. There were divine textures inheritances within the four divine kingdoms, and there were also divine texture experts lurking around, so he didn't want this secret to be leaked out.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the pit, Luo Luo Zheng conscientiously took out some materials and deftly crafted some ink.</p>

  <p>The level of difficulty of creating one-star divine textures wasn't that high, and Luo Luo Zheng had enough materials at hand. He finished preparing the rest of the materials he needed with ease. After he laid out a piece of paper, he extracted a strand of his soul from between his eyebrows and connected it with the runic pen in his hand.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current foundation, creating a one-star divine texture required no effort at all. So to speak, after about three minutes, the three meditation divine textures were all ready.</p>

  <p>He held the three-star divine textures in his hands while he compared them with the ten-star divine textures engraved on the shaft of the Black Star.</p>

  <p>Indeed, if one were to draw these one-star divine textures in the opposite order, it would be equivalent to drawing the lines of these ten-star divine textures.</p>

  <p>He had initially thought that the composition of a ten-star divine texture would be very complicated, but now it seemed that it was far from what he had imagined. The greatest truths were the simplest of all. They reached the same goal by different means.</p>

  <p>"And now?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Use your life vitality to activate these one-star divine textures and then register them onto the pickax," the cyan dragon answered.</p>

  <p>Following the instructions given by the cyan dragon, Luo Luo Zheng carefully imprinted a one-star divine texture onto the pickax. The moment he did so, one of the three ten-star divine textures on the Black Star suddenly glowed with light.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't ask anything more as he appreciated the soft glow. He continued to imprint the second divine texture onto it, and the third one after that.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Black Star was finally activated!</p>

  <p>A magnificent color appeared on the surface of the pickax, like a layer of oil being poured into water.</p>

  <p>"So beautiful!" Luo Luo Zheng praised.</p>

  <p>"Don't celebrate so soon! Put a drop of your blood onto the pickax. But let me remind you, this is a supreme divine weapon. It has its own will and will judge its master, and not everyone can be recognized as a master by it," the cyan dragon explained.</p>

  <p>"Hmm! Got it!" Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>After working so hard for so long, even if he really couldn't become its master, Luo Luo Zheng would accept it graciously. After all, he had done his best!</p>

  <p>Like before, Luo Luo Zheng flicked his finger, and a drop of blood fell towards the Black Star again.</p>

  <p>He understood that if he really couldn't become its master, then that would be his fate. He was no longer in a position to control the situation, but amidst that, he still stared at the drop of blood with great anticipation and with a nervous expression on his face.</p>
