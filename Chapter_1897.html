  <p>
</p>

  <p>Deaths were quite common in the cold flame field. However, the death of an elder of the Skyland race was an extremely rare occurrence.</p>

  <p>After all, the Skyland race mainly cultivated life vitality and they were also on their way to find out whether the divine land martial artist's speculations were true or not.</p>

  <p>The Skyland race attempted to travel across the cold flame field every once in a while, in hopes of witnessing a miracle that would let them understand its hidden mysteries.</p>

  <p>However, the Skyland race were unaware that the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, commonly referred to as Holy Jay by the martial artists of the divine land, had already established a boundary that was impossible to cross when he created the six great races.</p>

  <p>No matter it was Chapman, Kaydan, or Tilton from the Harmony race, while they were truly outstanding and their strengths improved really quickly, they couldn't advance any further after they had reached a certain limit.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because they lacked talent or perseverance, but rather, the boundary had already been set ever since the six great races had been created.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Skyland elites and elders had never gotten to cross the cold flame field with just their own strengths, no matter how hard they had tried. It seemed that they were destined to be always close, but never reaching success.</p>

  <p>After the elder of the Skyland race had died, Kaydan and Chapman also gave up. Both of them swallowed a Gold Sun Fruit and they immediately felt better.</p>

  <p>Everyone focused on Luo Luo Zheng once again. Basically, among the hundreds of people present, he was the only one who had not eaten a Gold Sun Fruit!</p>

  <p>At this moment, even Luo Luo Zheng had become extremely careful?</p>

  <p>The cold flame poison filled all the fibers in Luo Zheng's being and at the same time, the power of the nine stars that flowed in his body became stronger and faster.</p>

  <p>However, simply relying on the radiance that the nine stars emitted didn't completely melt those snowflakes. Although his inner world's temperature had been stabilized at a certain point, it still continued to drop slowly!</p>

  <p>The cold flame poison's power increased every time Luo Luo Zheng flew a thousand miles away. By the time he had covered a hundred and thirty thousand miles, its power had increased by several degrees already. In such case, the threat it posed to Luo Luo Zheng became deadlier.</p>

  <p>Then again, the nine stars' power did not last forever. It would take a long time to completely replenish the strength source within them.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, crossing the cold flame field was only the first step.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other warriors did not increase their speed as they traversed the ice field because of the fatal threat from the cold flame poison.</p>

  <p>Even though the Gold Sun Fruit possessed the power of the Sun Flame, there was still the possibility of it being extinguished if it was faced with copious amounts of cold flame poison. Thus, everyone still maintained a relatively constant speed that was neither too fast, nor too slow.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng was different. Since he tried to challenge the cold flame field and had so far withstood the cold flame poison's corrosion, he didn't need to maintain the same speed like everyone else.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, he suddenly moved in a flash, broke through the air, and advanced several thousand feet forward. The moment he came out of the space, he maxed out his speed limit and suddenly transformed into a straight line in front of everyone's eyes, before he rapidly advanced once again!!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! Is that kid crazy?"</p>

  <p>"He has just broken Pascal's record and he's already desperately moving forward!"</p>

  <p>"If he really can endure the cold flame poison, then doing so will help him to relieve the pressure. After all, the shorter the time consumed, the less of his life vitality would be used?"</p>

  <p>Kaydan, Chapman, and Tilton also looked at each other in shock.</p>

  <p>"This flame-proof warrior is truly extraordinary," Tilton couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he really will be able to safely pass through," Chapman said as he stared at the straight line that had faded away into distance.</p>

  <p>However, Kaydan looked worried. "What if this kid can't hold on any longer, and dies here?" he said.</p>

  <p>The only reason they had gathered so many warriors this time for this mission was because Luo Luo Zheng was there with them. If Luo Luo Zheng died, then there was no need for them to continue anymore.</p>

  <p>"Let's follow up and take a look," said Chapman. Luo Zheng's life was still the most important no matter what. It did not matter if he could or couldn't comprehend the cold flame field's profound mysteries.</p>

  <p>Once the three of them had finally decided, they chased after Luo Luo Zheng at full speed. But as they continued their pursuit, they realized that they were getting further away from Luo Luo Zheng. After they tried to chase him for about ten thousand miles, their faces lit up with a wry smile. Luo Luo Zheng was actually nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the cold flame field was a vast plain. Except for the cold flame that existed everywhere, there were no other dangers?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng felt as if he was sliced by an axe as the cold wind beat down on his body. At that moment, Luo Zheng's entire figure had disappeared as countless blue cold flames wrapped around him. He looked like a giant ball of fire that flew in the sky!</p>

  <p>While the cold blue flames further enveloped his body, he concentrated on rushing forward as he also paid more attention to his inner world.</p>

  <p>An unprecedented storm whirled around at his inner world's central continent. The storm contained six layers of Wind Law, which was the level of Wind Law that Luo Luo Zheng had comprehended. When combined with the chaotic energy, it released an immensely incredible amount of power!</p>

  <p>The storm now covered the whole central continent and the World Tree.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had started the storm because he wanted to protect the entire central continent within it. Since the snow that was transformed from the cold flame poison in his inner world became heavier, it might soon cover the entire central continent--which would end up in the deaths of the living beings in the inner world.</p>

  <p>A strong wind howled and blew the snowflakes to the chaotic sea that surrounded the central continent. The chaotic sea's surging waves faintly showed signs of being frozen as well. Floating ice appeared above the brown seawater, and these blocks of ice seemed to drift towards each other.</p>

  <p>If it was a martial artist that cultivated life vitality, then everything in his inner world would've been frozen in an instant. A Holy Being couldn't seal such a kind of chaos and not to mention, Luo Luo Zheng had made the chaotic energy possess the ability of devouring power.</p>

  <p>After the nine stars had swiftly devoured the snowflakes, they began to emit a bright beam of light that illuminated the entire chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>The many living beings in the inner world had already felt the impending apocalypse. Millions of martial artists scrambled on their feet to pray?</p>

  <p>"May the Venerable Creator use his holy power to expel this deadly snow!"</p>

  <p>"May our race live on forever!"</p>

  <p>"May the grand token of the Creator help our race go through this crisis!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had felt every single word that reverberated within his inner world.</p>

  <p>It was his instinct as this world's creator, but he had no time to pay them any attention at the moment.</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>One hundred and forty thousand miles!</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Luo Luo Zheng had crossed the boundary of 140, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>The blue flames on the ice filed had already been extinguished, but they weren't gone in the real sense. A substance changed its form when it had reached its limit, just like how water turned into ice after its temperature reached a certain degree.</p>

  <p>Naturally, those cold flames had changed their forms as well. They turned into regular icicles that were stuck on the ground like sharp needles.</p>

  <p>It was no doubt that the whole place was a world of extremely low temperatures.</p>

  <p>There were no signs of life at all. Even the flow of energy and the transformation of laws had stopped.</p>

  <p>There were no gales, not even a sound of the wind.</p>

  <p>The surroundings were completely silent, and only Luo Luo Zheng quietly advanced in the air.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the flame poison did not only freeze Luo Zheng's inner world, but also the flow of his blood, the beating of his heart, and his mind!</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>The immensely freezing environment almost stopped Luo Zheng's thinking--and he only had just one thought in mind: to fly forward at top speed!</p>

  <p>Just then, the vast and cold flame field suddenly underwent a peculiar change.</p>

  <p>The densely packed icicles were originally an icy-blue color, but some of them suddenly turned orange and formed orange runes. The juxtaposition of the two colors formed a sharp contrast.</p>

  <p>However, as Luo Luo Zheng flew above the runes, the orange hue of the icicles started to fade away and turn back to icy blue.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng traveled further and the runes on the ground began to fade as well. It was as if the orange icicles had formed a welcome carpet for Luo Luo Zheng. Once he had passed through, the path began to dissipate on its own.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng's mind was already frozen to its limit, he still noticed the strange phenomenon below him. He saw an orange strip of runes that extended into the distance in front of him.</p>

  <p>"150000 miles!"</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Luo Luo Zheng finally arrived at the end of the cold flame field. The runes that had suddenly appeared along the way had completely disappeared as well.</p>

  <p>In front of him was now a mirror that was over ten million feet tall, and extended all the way to the top of the cave in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. It divided the huge cave into two parts, and the scenes that were reflected in the mirror made him feel that this world was boundless.</p>
