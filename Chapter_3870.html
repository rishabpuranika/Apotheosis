<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had already readied himself to enter the Deleting Space once more when Othniel said something strange to him. A visible frown appeared on his face as he stared back at Othniel.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Grandmaster of Heaven, his opponents on both sides needed to be personally dealt with.</p>

  <p>As he was expelled in the Deleting Space that was controlled by Ziya, he was surprised when he observed that the time node could be directly changed.</p>

  <p>When he was being transferred between the two places, all he thought about was how he could defeat Ziya.</p>

  <p>In his mind, if he could replace Ziya who was controlling the Deleting Space, then he could earn a lot from it. Most importantly, he could also return to the chaos through the time node.</p>

  <p>"I didn't do anything. If you want, you can try again," the Grandmaster of Heaven responded with a straight face.</p>

  <p>While Othniel heard these words, a strange expression glimmered in his eyes. He took a few steps forward and sneered, "Are you mocking me?"</p>

  <p>"No. Of course not," the Grandmaster of Heaven quickly replied. "I'm just hoping that you can try sending me back into that space again."</p>

  <p>Seeing the sincere expression of the Grandmaster of Heaven, all of the Eternal Realm warriors that were currently present couldn't help but look at each other with confused faces.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Grandmaster of Heaven had a rough estimate of Ziya's abilities.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Othniel wasn't pretending. Ziya had most probably shut down the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Now, the Grandmaster of Heaven was more interested in this magical place and yearned for it even more.</p>

  <p>However, Othniel couldn't understand what the Grandmaster of Heaven was really thinking. He tried several times, but the space around the Grandmaster of Heaven was just constantly shaking and there was no way to send him in.</p>

  <p>With all that was happening, Othniel couldn't help but ask him, "Tell me.</p>

  <p>What exactly happened in that space?"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven shrugged and said, "Ha, I can't tell you that."</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't have the slightest intention of telling Othniel the matter about Ziya.</p>

  <p>"All right then. I'll know after I kill you." Othniel's voice suddenly became cold. He had a strong urge to figure out what had truly happened in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the cubic space surrounding the Grandmaster of Heaven transformed into a solid cube.</p>

  <p>Othniel controlled the space truth. With it, he could define and manipulate most of the spaces in the chaos. This time, he controlled the space containing the Grandmaster of Heaven and transformed it into a solid state.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, the whole cube instantly collapsed.</p>

  <p>If it was an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior, they would be completely shattered along with the crushed space fragments.</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven was fully prepared, and he was powerful enough not to be easily defeated by such kind of move.</p>

  <p>When the view became clear, all they saw were broken space fragments.</p>

  <p>The body of the Grandmaster of Heaven couldn't be seen anywhere.</p>

  <p>Othniel instantly felt a shiver creeping beneath his skin, as if some dangerous beast was glaring at him somewhere in the dark. Suddenly, the Grandmaster of Heaven appeared above his head.</p>

  <p>He was holding a long sword that was pointed downwards, like a praying swordsman. The tip of the sword immediately dashed downwards in an attempt to directly stab Othniel's head.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a blue light flashed in Othniel's eyes, and the space above his head suddenly became distorted. The long sword that was supposed to stab his head disappeared as it touched the distorted space. Immediately after that, the sword appeared from the side of the Grandmaster of Heaven, directly aimed at his head.</p>

  <p>Othniel bent the space and threw the sword back to the Grandmaster of Heaven to stab himself instead.</p>

  <p>However, just before the sword thrust through him, the eyes of the Grandmaster of Heaven also beamed with the same blue light. Suddenly, the space beside his head also became distorted. The Cyan Misty Sword that was fast approaching him instantly disappeared. In a split second, a distorted space appeared in front of Othniel's chest, and the sword rushed out with a violent force, thrusting directly towards his chest.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>A ray of cyan light pierced through Othniel from front to back.</p>

  <p>A hint of confusion appeared in Othniel's eyes as he slowly looked at the sword stabbing in his chest. Blood was dripping on his mouth as he stared back at the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Only I could distort the space. How did you..."</p>

  <p>The truth was many people could actually connect two points in space and create a circular space channel. It was also the case with the space distortion that Othniel created.</p>

  <p>However, most temporary channels that were created by ordinary people were unstable. Only Othniel could manipulate and create a distorted space that could deflect a sword strike that had the power of hundreds of thousands of Jun.</p>

  <p>But it turned out that Othniel wasn't the only one who could do it now, as the Grandmaster of Heaven blatantly used the same powerful skill to attack him. Since Othniel began to fight with this man, there had been several mysterious things he witnessed that he couldn't comprehend.</p>

  <p>"You're asking me why I can do that?" the Grandmaster of Heaven spoke as he slowly pulled out his Cyan Misty Sword from Othniel through the distorted spaces. "It's because the truth-level token is not unique to you. I can also grasp it. And you know what? I can grasp more skills from you if I want."</p>

  <p>Othniel's eyes narrowed. There was an extreme mixture of surprise and rage on his face.</p>

  <p>If their previous battles seemed to be opportunities to test each other's strengths, then now would be the time for a showdown.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's words rang in his ears, and he understood them very well.</p>

  <p>They meant that the Grandmaster of Heaven could deprive the abilities of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Whether he could really do that or not was still unknown. However, the fact remained that he had just used the same space distortion token as Othniel did.</p>

  <p>"You're an arrogant piece of crap, aren't you? Let's see if you really have the ability to do that!"</p>

  <p>Othniel roared in anger. His face began to deform, his pair of eyes started to merge into one, and his teeth became sharper. His head was beginning to expand rapidly as he attempted to return to his original form.</p>

  <p>The spectating warriors also knew that the two powerful masters would likely transform into their strongest forms if they were determined to have an all-out battle. That meant that Othniel would turn into his original monstrous form, and the Grandmaster of Heaven would use his Wild God Body.</p>

  <p>However, much to their surprise, that wasn't the intention of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>He stood in the air and stared at Othniel with a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Othniel's transformation stopped abruptly. It was as if a superior force suppressed the changes that were going on.</p>

  <p>"Why would you need to transform? You look good in your human form.</p>

  <p>You don't need to become that ugly one-eyed monster."</p>

  <p>Then, the Grandmaster of Heaven gently raised his Cyan Misty Sword.</p>

  <p>Soon after, three thin threads quietly appeared and turned out to tightly wrap around Othniel's body. Suddenly, the white thin threads grew larger and turned into white jade chains. The other ends of the chains were connected to a small yellow lock that was in the hand of the Grandmaster of Heaven. The lock was exceptionally exquisite, and there were undecipherable Sanskrit words on both sides. It was the Heart-piercing Lock, another powerful magic treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Grandmaster of Heaven had given a hint that three strikes were all it would take him to kill Othniel. These three sword strikes were what activated the Heart-piercing Lock that completely suppressed Othniel's body. Now everything in Othniel's body was locked up, meaning that all his theurgies were sealed. That was why there was no need for him to use the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>On the outside, Othniel looked motionless. But the truth was he was currently in a fierce struggle within his body. He was trying to free himself, but the Heart-piercing Lock was absolutely powerful. He was extremely enraged with the fact that the dignified Chaos Ancient God like him would be defeated by the Grandmaster of Heaven in this way.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven knew about Othniel's on-going efforts and struggling, but he didn't pay much attention to it. He just slowly descended while dragging the white jade chains.</p>

  <p>Now that he was able to successfully trap Othniel, it was time for him to deal with the other warriors present.</p>

  <p>He knew these warriors' high positions and standpoints in the Source World, but it didn't matter to him. Since he couldn't kill the real masters in the Three Purities Stage, he decided to annihilate first these duplicates of them.</p>
