<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The third Shade Stone appeared less than a month after the second one had appeared.</p>

  <p>The people in the Source World and the Li Shan mountain began to worry at this.</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility they could think of why the Shade Stones were appearing so frequently: the end of the chaotic era was near.</p>

  <p>But this round of chaotic era seemed to find itself in worse situations with every passing hour.</p>

  <p>In the past, at the end of a chaotic era, only one primitive land like the Source World existed and only one civilization ruled this primitive land.</p>

  <p>When the era ended, this ruling civilization would gather the power of the entire civilization to resist it.</p>

  <p>This didn't mean that every era had a ruling civilization. It was also possible that there were anywhere between three and five superpowers that could also join hands to fight the coming of the end. In the face of the oncoming destruction of the chaos, all the past hatred between these superpowers was to no avail.</p>

  <p>In this chaotic era, not only had there been no ruling civilization, even the various super forces had fallen into a state of disunity.</p>

  <p>Even the Li Shan mountain, which usually attached the greatest importance to the Finale Way, had to worry about their own fate as they hid in Luo Zheng's primitive land.</p>

  <p>At this point, no one had the time to think about the end of the chaos.</p>

  <p>About twenty days later, the fourth Shade Stone appeared, and another grain of sand went missing from the hourglass.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a bloody cocoon cracked open on the blood red sky of the primitive land, and Luo Zheng crawled out of it.</p>

  <p>"Is this blood cocoon the last skill to strengthen my physical body?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"For the time being, it is," the ancestry-level bloodline replied.</p>

  <p>"Then it's time to set out to do what I have to," Luo Zheng said, his jaw set in determination.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure flashed before falling down like a meteor. It wasn't long before he landed on the jadeite platform of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had, during this time, descended onto the jadeite platform several times. He had some news to give Luo Zheng, but every time he had come, Luo Zheng had been cultivating in seclusion. So he hadn't usually stayed long and left quickly on discovering that Luo Zheng wasn't present.</p>

  <p>Today, however, the Primeval Lord of Heaven got lucky with the chance to meet Luo Zheng, having waited here for a long time.</p>

  <p>"The Grandmaster of Heaven has come to the Night View Island three times," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, going straight to the point.</p>

  <p>"What did he come there for?" Luo Zheng said, feeling it strange that this had happened.</p>

  <p>"The Bird Masters are anxious to let us ascend to the Jade Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>The Jade Pure Realm had resumed its usual peaceful state as the war between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect had finally stopped for a period of time. But the Bird Masters were still in a constant state of panic, given that the Snake Spirit Sect was like a ferocious tiger waiting to pounce on them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought about this for a while before saying, "Even if we go up to the Jade Pure Realm, we won't immediately attack the Snake Spirit Sect."</p>

  <p>His goal had always been to reach the altar on the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled. "If we bring the Monkey Spirit Sect into the Jade Pure Realm, we can deter the Snake Spirit Sect. This will ease the pressure on the Bird Masters."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the primitive land that had grown bigger and said, "Then it's time for us to go."</p>

  <p>At the north of the Supreme Pure Realm...</p>

  <p>Thousands of gulls with beaks like those of cranes, were crawling up the sides of the mountains.</p>

  <p>These gulls looked comical in their appearance, their big beaks looking like pickaxes. Their bodies weren't too big, but they were notorious among the Other Shore creatures in the Supreme Pure Realm. They were smart, cruel, and great in number. The prey they targeted always ended up facing a miserable death.</p>

  <p>They had been here for several days and nights in order to capture the bone worms crossing the border.</p>

  <p>And now, they suddenly felt the aura of living beings coming up the sides of the mountains.</p>

  <p>The gull in the lead stretched out its head and looked around, only to see people emerging from a cave in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Coo, coo..."</p>

  <p>"Goo! Goo! Goo!"</p>

  <p>The gulls began to discuss this development with each other.</p>

  <p>According to what they remembered, human beings were weak and were excellent food, but the number was too small.</p>

  <p>They had never been in a situation where dozens of human beings had appeared at one time, like they were appearing right now.</p>

  <p>The gulls with the beaks of cranes always became excited before hunting, but had to calm down if they wanted to successfully catch their prey. As long as the humans continued to approach them, the gulls would swarm forward and the humans would become their food within seconds.</p>

  <p>They had barely calmed down when suddenly, they felt a shadow sweep over their heads, as if a dark cloud had now enveloped them.</p>

  <p id="top_22">It never rained in the Supreme Pure Realm. What they were seeing was a giant foot.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The huge foot, along with the gulls and the mountains, disappeared, leaving only a large, deep footprint behind. The whole of the Supreme Pure Realm trembled. .</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King strode forward.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures retreated in fright at the sight of this enormous creature.</p>

  <p>Even the hatred-level Treacherous Beings meant disaster for the Supreme Pure Realm. Just how powerful was an existence like the Monkey Spirit King?</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng and the human heroes had emerged from the cave, they climbed onto the back of the Wing King.</p>

  <p>The Wing King flapped his wings and followed closely behind the Monkey Spirit King, like a green leaf floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Once the Wing King entered the Night View Island, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also asked for a Blood-controlling Method for the Wing King. As a result, the Wing King's control over speed and space had increased greatly.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Pagoda Mountains were not far from the cave.</p>

  <p>About four hours later, the Monkey Spirit King stopped before the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>"How to open the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm?" the Monkey Spirit King asked, directing the question to no one in particular.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters, including Manuel, were standing on the Monkey Spirit King's shoulders, directing him on how to open the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"Look at the third row from the left. Bring down the one hundred and twentieth pagoda mountain in this row."</p>

  <p>"And then the pagoda mountain in the sixty-sixth row on the upper right..."</p>

  <p>"The first row..."</p>

  <p>The Myriad Pagoda Mountains were like a chessboard to the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>With Manuel's help, the Monkey Spirit King strolled among the pagoda mountains and pushed these marked mountains to the ground.</p>

  <p>When the Monkey Spirit King had brought down about fourteen pagoda mountains, the ground began to shake, followed by the violent clicking sound of what seemed to be a mechanical device.</p>

  <p>"Click, click, click, click..."</p>

  <p>All the mechanical devices under the ground clicked into place, activating a magic array in the process. A blue circle of light suddenly appeared at the center of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, expanding quickly into a space channel.</p>

  <p>"This is the passage to the Jade Pure Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, excitement thrumming through his voice.</p>

  <p>The human heroes had, in the past, paid a huge price to find this passage, but had eventually failed.</p>

  <p>"In fact, there are several passages leading to the Jade Pure Realm. All of them are in different directions. The passage that the Monkey Spirit King has opened is the largest one," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's only remnant soul had also followed them this time.</p>

  <p>"I'll go in first. You guys follow me," the Monkey Spirit King said, turning around to face the rest.</p>

  <p>He then leapt gently, the Monkey Masters on his shoulders, and was sucked into the passage the moment he touched it.</p>

  <p>Once the Monkey Masters had entered the passage, the Wing King unfurled his wings and flew towards it.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The space channel was completely dark.</p>

  <p>It was more like a motionless space than a passageway.</p>

  <p>Everyone remained there, as if locked up in a dark world.</p>

  <p>They waited for a few minutes before the dark world suddenly lit up and a new world appeared before them.</p>
