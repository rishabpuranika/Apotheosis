  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since Ling Shuang had explained Luo Zheng's predicament, Yudie and Xi Youqin had been sick with worry.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Yudie found herself envying Liusu, Nelly and Xun, since they were blissfully ignorant, cultivating within the Phoenix Palace walls.</p>

  <p>At times, she even regretted leaving Luo Zheng's inner world. If she had stayed in the Immortal Mansion, she wouldn't have had any clue as to what was happening in the outside.</p>

  <p>But, all of a sudden, these worries disappeared the second she heard her lover's voice.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>From the end of the corridor, Xi Youqin had transformed into a purple shadow that flew towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yudie also threw herself into Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>"Plop..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had been physically exhausted when he rushed into the light column, felt little to no strength now.</p>

  <p>So when the two women pounced on him, Luo Zheng fell backwards under their weight.</p>

  <p>Surprised that he was so weak, Yudie hurriedly asked, "Darling, is there something wrong with you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," Luo Zheng answered with a smile. He fondly stroked Yudie's hair.</p>

  <p>"Are you hungry? Do you have no strength left?" Xi Youqin asked with concern, laying her hand gently on Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>"You're half right," Luo Zheng replied with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"So..."</p>

  <p>The two women lovingly gushed at Luo Zheng, and he patiently replied to all their queries with a serene expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang sat opposite to Luo Zheng, but she felt like an outsider.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was still trapped on the Other Shore, she had often visited them.</p>

  <p>Here, she learned that Luo Zheng had several lovers, and that there were even three more cultivating in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Although Ling Shuang maintained her composure, internally, she cursed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She never expected Luo Zheng was like this...</p>

  <p>However, she too was relieved that Luo Zheng had finally woken up. She smiled slightly. She knew nothing could trap  Luo Zheng, not even the Dark Region!</p>

  <p>After he answered all their questions, Luo Zheng gently flicked his hand. His space ring appeared, and he took a considerable amount of divine crystals. Then, he crushed them and threw them into his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>These divine crystals released their energy and nourished Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's two Other Shore Tokens absorbed these divine crystals' energy greedily, and then transformed the energy into the Other Shore Power. It didn't take Luo Zheng long to crush more than a hundred thousand divine crystals into his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>After most of his Other Shore Power was restored, Luo Zheng finally relaxed.</p>

  <p>Turning to Ling Shuang, he smiled. "So, you successfully retreated from the Grand Sky Temple!"</p>

  <p>In the Dark Region, Luo Zheng didn't know what was going on outside. He had been worried that Ling Shuang would be in danger when they had parted ways.</p>

  <p>"Yes. How about Feng Ge? Is she all right?" Ling Shuang asked.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Feng Ge had been asked to stay in the Dark Region by the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>She clenched her fists. Ling Shuang had always felt that she should've been the one by Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>"We are still trapped in that damned place," Luo Zheng answered in a frustrated tone.</p>

  <p>"You and Feng Ge are still trapped? Then how were you able to leave?"</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Since there were no outsiders present, Luo Zheng decided it was safe to tell them everything. Briefly, he explained to them what had happened to him and Feng Ge in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The more Luo Zheng talked, the more worried Ling Shuang became. "What should we do... Will you be trapped there forever?"</p>

  <p>"There is always a solution," Luo Zheng consoled her. "At least now, I can come back to replenish my strength."</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng used all his Other Shore Power, he could fight a black monkey.</p>

  <p>However, once that was used up, he would be left defenseless against all the other creatures there.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that I don't have any candles," Ling Shuang murmured, biting her lips.</p>

  <p>If she had candles, she would've entered the Dark Region again to attempt to rescue Luo Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Seeing how Ling Shuang cared about him so much, Luo Zheng was moved. "Don't worry," he said and smiled. "I'll definitely find a way out."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was speaking, Trish suddenly burst into the room. "Tia, there're two guests? " Her eyes widened when she saw Luo Zheng. "Mr. Luo, you are awake!"</p>

  <p>During Luo Zheng's stay on the Other Shore, Trish had reported everything happening in the house to Yudie.</p>

  <p>Hence, she was surprised to see Luo Zheng awake.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded. "Who are the guests?"</p>

  <p>Before Trish could reply, two elegant figures emerged from behind her. One wore a blue robe, the other, a green dress. It was Feng Ge in her physical form and her mother, Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Concubine Yan, Luo Zheng instantly knew the purpose of their visit.</p>

  <p>Since Feng Ge was able to find out his true identity, she had probably told her mother by now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood up and bowed to Concubine Yan. "I didn't know that you were here, Lady Concubine Yan, so I didn't come to greet you. My apologies."</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan smiled slightly, her eyes twinkling charmingly. "It's easy for me to forgive you. After all, you must protect my daughter and make sure she makes it out of the Dark Region unharmed!"</p>

  <p>"Mother!" Feng Ge whined.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang frowned. Feng Ge had entered the Dark Region voluntarily, so Luo Zheng had nothing to do with it. But Concubine Yan seemed to be putting the blame on him.</p>

  <p>"If I can safely leave that damned place, I will definitely protect Princess Feng Ge," Luo Zheng replied respectfully.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, though, Concubine Yan was dissatisfied with his polite answer.</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward, she looked at him fiercely. "Feng Ge is my only daughter. I won't allow anything bad to happen to her." Her eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Promise me, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned slightly, and even Yudie and Xi Youqin watched uneasily.</p>

  <p>As a formidable woman, Concubine Yan keenly sensed their emotions. It was out of character for her to be unusually stern. "As long as Feng Ge can leave the Dark Region and get out of the Other Shore safely, I will reward you graciously."</p>

  <p>If it were anyone else who talked to him like this, Luo Zheng would probably have sent the guest out immediately.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng broke into the Phoenix Palace, it was Concubine Yan who had showed him the way. Besides, she had also helped him in the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could understand that Concubine Yan's unreasonable demand was out of her love and worry for her beloved daughter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng bowed to her again. "Don't worry, Lady Concubine Yan. The Dark Region is not as dangerous as you think. We are not in a desperate situation."</p>

  <p>At least, in the meantime, they were safe within the column of light.</p>

  <p>What was more, those pig-faced monsters were not that intelligent. With these cards, they still had a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sincere expression made Concubine Yan calm down a little. The most fearful thing for her was that Luo Zheng would leave her daughter behind. All the way from the Phoenix Palace, she had been trying to figure out how she would talk to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In order to get the answer she wanted, she risked being a bit rude to Luo Zheng.</p>
