<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since Dorothy had explained Zheng's predicament, Yudie and Margaret had been sick with worry.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Yudie found herself envying Liusu, Nelly and Xun, since they were blissfully ignorant, cultivating within the Phoenix Palace walls.</p>

  <p>At times, she even regretted leaving Zheng's inner world. If she had stayed in the fairy palace, she wouldn't have had any clue as to what was happening in the outside.</p>

  <p>But, all of a sudden, these worries disappeared the second she heard her lover's voice.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>From the end of the corridor, Margaret had transformed into a purple shadow that flew towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yudie also threw herself into Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>"Plop..."</p>

  <p>Zheng, who had been physically exhausted when he rushed into the light column, felt little to no strength now.</p>

  <p>So when the two women pounced on him, Zheng fell backwards under their weight.</p>

  <p>Surprised that he was so weak, Yudie hurriedly asked, "Darling, is there something wrong with you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," Zheng answered with a smile. He fondly stroked Yudie's hair.</p>

  <p>"Are you hungry? Do you have no strength left?" Margaret asked with concern, laying her hand gently on Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>"You're half right," Zheng replied with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"So..."</p>

  <p>The two women lovingly gushed at Zheng, and he patiently replied to all their queries with a serene expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Dorothy sat opposite to Zheng, but she felt like an outsider.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was still trapped on the Other Shore, she had often visited them.</p>

  <p>Here, she learned that Zheng had several lovers, and that there were even three more cultivating in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Although Dorothy maintained her composure, internally, she cursed at Zheng.</p>

  <p>She never expected Zheng was like this...</p>

  <p>However, she too was relieved that Zheng had finally woken up. She smiled slightly. She knew nothing could trap  Zheng Luo, not even the Dark Region!</p>

  <p>After he answered all their questions, Zheng gently flicked his hand. His space ring appeared, and he took a considerable amount of divine crystals. Then, he crushed them and threw them into his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>These divine crystals released their energy and nourished Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's two Other Shore Tokens absorbed these divine crystals' energy greedily, and then transformed the energy into the Other Shore Power. It didn't take Zheng long to crush more than a hundred thousand divine crystals into his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>After most of his Other Shore Power was restored, Zheng finally relaxed.</p>

  <p>Turning to Dorothy, he smiled. "So, you successfully retreated from the Grand Sky Temple!"</p>

  <p>In the Dark Region, Zheng didn't know what was going on outside. He had been worried that Dorothy would be in danger when they had parted ways.</p>

  <p>"Yes. How about Feng Ge? Is she all right?" Dorothy asked.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Feng Ge had been asked to stay in the Dark Region by the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>She clenched her fists. Dorothy had always felt that she should've been the one by Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>"We are still trapped in that damned place," Zheng answered in a frustrated tone.</p>

  <p>"You and Feng Ge are still trapped? Then how were you able to leave?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Since there were no outsiders present, Zheng decided it was safe to tell them everything. Briefly, he explained to them what had happened to him and Feng Ge in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The more Zheng talked, the more worried Dorothy became. "What should we do... Will you be trapped there forever?"</p>

  <p>"There is always a solution," Zheng consoled her. "At least now, I can come back to replenish my strength."</p>

  <p>If Zheng used all his Other Shore Power, he could fight a black monkey.</p>

  <p>However, once that was used up, he would be left defenseless against all the other creatures there.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that I don't have any candles," Dorothy murmured, biting her lips.</p>

  <p>If she had candles, she would've entered the Dark Region again to attempt to rescue Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Seeing how Dorothy cared about him so much, Zheng was moved. "Don't worry," he said and smiled. "I'll definitely find a way out."</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was speaking, Trish suddenly burst into the room. "Tia, there're two guests— " Her eyes widened when she saw Zheng. "Mr. Luo, you are awake!"</p>

  <p>During Zheng's stay on the Other Shore, Trish had reported everything happening in the house to Yudie.</p>

  <p>Hence, she was surprised to see Zheng awake.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng nodded. "Who are the guests?"</p>

  <p>Before Trish could reply, two elegant figures emerged from behind her. One wore a blue robe, the other, a green dress. It was Feng Ge in her physical form and her mother, Flamine.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Flamine, Zheng instantly knew the purpose of their visit.</p>

  <p>Since Feng Ge was able to find out his true identity, she had probably told her mother by now.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood up and bowed to Flamine. "I didn't know that you were here, Lady Flamine, so I didn't come to greet you. My apologies."</p>

  <p>Flamine smiled slightly, her eyes twinkling charmingly. "It's easy for me to forgive you. After all, you must protect my daughter and make sure she makes it out of the Dark Region unharmed!"</p>

  <p>"Mother!" Feng Ge whined.</p>

  <p>Dorothy frowned. Feng Ge had entered the Dark Region voluntarily, so Zheng had nothing to do with it. But Flamine seemed to be putting the blame on him.</p>

  <p>"If I can safely leave that damned place, I will definitely protect Princess Feng Ge," Zheng replied respectfully.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, though, Flamine was dissatisfied with his polite answer.</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward, she looked at him fiercely. "Feng Ge is my only daughter. I won't allow anything bad to happen to her." Her eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Promise me, Zheng."</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned slightly, and even Yudie and Margaret watched uneasily.</p>

  <p>As a formidable woman, Flamine keenly sensed their emotions. It was out of character for her to be unusually stern. "As long as Feng Ge can leave the Dark Region and get out of the Other Shore safely, I will reward you graciously."</p>

  <p>If it were anyone else who talked to him like this, Zheng would probably have sent the guest out immediately.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng broke into the Phoenix Palace, it was Flamine who had showed him the way. Besides, she had also helped him in the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Zheng could understand that Flamine's unreasonable demand was out of her love and worry for her beloved daughter.</p>

  <p>Zheng bowed to her again. "Don't worry, Lady Flamine. The Dark Region is not as dangerous as you think. We are not in a desperate situation."</p>

  <p>At least, in the meantime, they were safe within the column of light.</p>

  <p>What was more, those pig-faced monsters were not that intelligent. With these cards, they still had a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sincere expression made Flamine calm down a little. The most fearful thing for her was that Zheng would leave her daughter behind. All the way from the Phoenix Palace, she had been trying to figure out how she would talk to Zheng.</p>

  <p>In order to get the answer she wanted, she risked being a bit rude to Zheng.</p>
