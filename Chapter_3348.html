<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wouldn't have been wise to make Feng Ge angry were they on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But they were in the Phoenix Palace now. Here, no holds were barred.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's stimulation, Teague's memories, hidden in the depths of Feng Ge's mind and body, were drawn out in a steady stream.</p>

  <p>"Puny humans! The Blood Assembly will grind you into minced meat soon enough! I..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's voice changed. The blood power in her body started to burn, wisps of golden flames threatening to flare out. The fact that her inner world was emitting energy like this was a dangerous signal.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine, be careful. Her inner world may explode!" Luo Zheng reminded.</p>

  <p>If Feng Ge's inner world exploded, Luo Zheng and Flamine wouldn't be hurt, but Feng Ge would die.</p>

  <p>Flamine only scoffed.</p>

  <p>She seemed to have been prepared for this. She touched Feng Ge's belly with her hand. The energy that was gathering in Feng Ge's belly faded away instantly.</p>

  <p>Then she flicked Feng Ge's head several times. Rays of light shot out from her fingers and drilled into Feng Ge's black hair.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge held her head and screamed as the agony grew more intense.</p>

  <p>"It's time. Now!" Flamine barked out.</p>

  <p>The three old men closed their eyes, and the array became more powerful.</p>

  <p>Flamine then dragged out some wisps of white light from Feng Ge's head.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Dragging the white light, Flamine stepped back into the center of the array and pressed her hand on the ground.</p>

  <p>The wisps of white light interwove together, turning into a milky white flame.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the white flame, his eyebrows raised. "It's the Memory Flame."</p>

  <p>The white flame was very dim, but still emitted a fierce aura. It was clearly the Memory Flame Teague had left in Feng Ge's soul. Flamine had extracted it using a technique Luo Zheng had never encountered before.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Seal the Memory Flame!" Flamine ordered.</p>

  <p>She knew that with Teague being a purified being, his Memory Flame must contain some very precious memories. Memories about the Blood Assembly alone would be very valuable. So she wanted to leave them to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>However, just then, the flame started to blur and turn into Teague's original form.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was fully materialized, Teague only sneered before disappearing.</p>

  <p>The faces of Flamine and the three old men fell. The Memory Flame disappeared so fast that they weren't able to seal it up.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, dripping with sweat, finally collapsed to the ground, her arms still strung up by the fire chains.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine, could you put Feng Ge down now?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Flamine turned around, her face softening.</p>

  <p>They might have failed to seal the Memory Flame, but at least Teague's damned memories were out of Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge fortunately didn't lose her memories, but her memories had been a jumbled mess after mixing with Teague's.</p>

  <p>It would return to normal eventually once all the chaos was resolved.</p>

  <p>With a flick of Flamine's finger, the two fire chains disappeared. She walked over to help Feng Ge up and then turned to Luo Zheng with a smile. "She'll be okay, thanks to you. I've done extractions many times before, but that pig-faced monster was pretty sly. I couldn't get him out."</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine, you are being too polite. I did nothing," Luo Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'll take Feng Ge to rest. You seldom come to the Phoenix Palace. Do you want to visit your...friends?" Flamine asked, giving Luo Zheng a meaningful look.</p>

  <p>She stressed the word "friend" on purpose.</p>

  <p>She was a smart woman. She knew that the relationship between Luo Zheng and Liusu and the other two wasn't just friendship.</p>

  <p>By experience, she knew it was normal for a man to have several concubines. Flamine herself was not the only concubine of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, after all.</p>

  <p>What mattered to her was Luo Zheng's principal wife, Yudie. She had even privately asked Liusu about her once.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter. If she married Luo Zheng, her status would still be very important.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in response to Flamine's question.</p>

  <p>Since he had come to the Phoenix Palace, he must pay a visit to his wives.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had mentioned to Luo Zheng that Liusu was beset with an unusual condition. Her affliction had caused a fire in the Phoenix Palace, prompting Feng Ge to arrange an independent palace for her.</p>

  <p>Liusu's preternatural flame was called Sprite Fire. Only those who had the Fire Crow's blood could get it.</p>

  <p>Flamine ordered a maid to take Luo Zheng to the Heavenly Cultivation Palace in the north part of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>A commotion was currently breaking out at the open space in front of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. dozens of people had gathered around the cause at the center of it all: a tall woman and a young man facing off in apparent combat, except the former was simply evading the latter.</p>

  <p>The young man and the tall woman had just entered the Sea of Truth, and had not merged with any Other Shore Token. Their cultivation levels were about the same, but the man's martial arts were obviously much stronger than those of the woman.</p>

  <p>The tall woman wouldn't dare to fight head-on and could only resort to dodging attacks.</p>

  <p>"This courtyard is only over a hundred feet wide. You can't run forever!"</p>

  <p>The young man waved the long sword in his hand toward the tall woman.</p>

  <p>When the tall woman saw this, a fierce look suddenly appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>This time, instead of retreating, she flipped the long blood-red sword in her hand. If she had to die, then so be it. But she was bringing him with her.</p>

  <p>"Xun! Don't risk it!"</p>

  <p>"It's okay to lose! We can just leave the Phoenix Palace!"</p>

  <p>Liusu and Nelly cried out, turning pale.</p>

  <p>The tall woman was Xun, and the man challenging her was called Ahmad, a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Under the protection of Feng Ge, Liusu, Nelly and Xun received more resources than many direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace, even more so after Liusu was given a palace to herself.</p>

  <p>This apparent special treatment made the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace jealous and resentful.</p>

  <p>Everything would have been fine if Feng Ge had been at the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>She was the most outstanding among the young generation in the Taiyi Mountain, and enjoyed Eastern Emperor Taiyi's love. No one could outshine her.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge had been away for quite some time now. The news that she was trapped on the Other Shore spread throughout the Phoenix Palace. Many people thought she wouldn't come back.</p>

  <p>As time passed, the direct descendants started coming up with some evil ideas.</p>

  <p>And so Ahmad was sent to anger the three women.</p>

  <p>Xun knew what the direct descendants were up to. She had quite the temper, and she was now starting to lose control of it. Although they were trying hard not to engage, the direct descendants kept provoking them deliberately. They had no choice but to fight back.</p>

  <p>Xun's strength was inferior to Ahmad's, so she had been at a disadvantage since the fight began.</p>

  <p>But she was much more experienced in battle. She noticed that Ahmad was avoiding anything life-threatening, so she fought back with deadly moves.</p>

  <p>Before long, she had taken the upper hand.</p>
