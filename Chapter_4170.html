  <p>
</p>

  <p>Currently, Zheng's primitive land was already large enough to accommodate the entire Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>However, if they wanted to let the Pear Hill inside the primitive land, they had to slow it down first.</p>

  <p>The problem was that over forty million heads were chasing behind the Pear Hill. Once it slowed down, it would then be engulfed by the sea of heads.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they had no choice but to change its direction once again and flew past the primitive land for the eighth time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, they redirected the Pear Hill in the other direction.</p>

  <p>The huge mouth of the primitive land was still wide open.</p>

  <p>It could actually devour the entire Pear Hill and the millions of heads in one gulp.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The heads chasing behind weren't fast enough to change their trajectories, so they drilled directly into the mouth of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>After swallowing the heads, the primitive land expanded again at an incredible rate.</p>

  <p>In an instant, its size doubled again.</p>

  <p>Now, it was more than twice the size of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>But more importantly, the heads that were chasing after the Pear Hill were finally gone. There was not a single one to be seen in the void anymore.</p>

  <p>Without them chasing the Pear Hill, it could now begin to slow down.</p>

  <p>However, with such a huge mountain moving at a high speed, it would take much time and effort to slow it down.</p>

  <p>It took them an hour to finally decrease its speed to a thousand feet per three seconds. Then, they positioned the Pear Hill to fly directly towards the primitive land.</p>

  <p>When they were just dozens of miles away, the primitive land opened its big mouth, waiting for the Pear Hill to drill into it.</p>

  <p>Everything went quite well. Zheng and the Eternal Realm warriors were finally relieved to see that they were going to be safe.</p>

  <p>However, what they didn't expect was that the primitive land actually brought fear to the creatures of the Pear Hill. It was partly their fault because they didn't explain to the residents of Pear Hill what the primitive land really was.</p>

  <p>"The heads were all gone?"</p>

  <p>"I think they were eaten by that huge monster!"</p>

  <p>"Wait! That monster increased its size again!" "Is it trying to devour the Pear Hill? We're doomed!"</p>

  <p>Only Zheng and the Eternal Realm warriors knew what the primitive land was. Thus, it was natural for the hundreds of millions of creatures residing in the Pear Hill to shiver in fear in the face of this "enormous monster".</p>

  <p>As the Pear Hill rushed steadily to the mouth of the primitive land, panic spread quickly.</p>

  <p>Several mountain leaders flew towards the Snake Goddess and asked why they weren't changing the direction of the Pear Hill, and why it seemed like they were drilling into a huge clam monster's body on purpose.</p>

  <p>"Did they just refer it as a clam monster?" After taking a better look at the primitive land, Zheng finally saw what they were talking about. He smiled bitterly as he stared at the primitive land that actually looked like a huge clam with many sharp teeth.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess wasted no time and explained to the mountain leaders what really was going on.</p>

  <p>When the mountain leaders learned the truth, they quickly bowed their heads and apologized for their intrusion. However, they knew that all the people were still panicking, so they said, "We're glad that the Pear Hill is alright. But please tell the people what's going on. It'll be better if the information comes directly from you to alleviate their worries."</p>

  <p>"I understand. It's my fault that I put this matter aside as we were focused on how to ensure the safety of the Pear Hill. Don't worry. I'll speak to them," the Snake Goddess responded with sincerity.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, she took a deep breath, and a penetrating voice quickly spread in the entire Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>"People of the Pear Hill, please don't panic! There have been huge changes in the chaos. As you saw earlier, there were heads everywhere, and there are other things that are currently going on. Right now, we have to find a safe place to hide. That huge clam-like monster is actually  Zheng Luo's inner world. Once we enter it, we should be safe!"</p>

  <p>The other mountain leaders, the sect leaders and members, and even the citizens in the cities were all shocked as they heard what the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>They all knew that building an inner world wasn't an easy task.</p>

  <p>Zheng's inner world could even float within the chaos. That was new to them.</p>

  <p>And to top it all, Zheng's inner world was so enormous that it could accommodate the entire Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Although it sounded inconceivable and insane, they believed the words of the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>After all, she had high prestige in the Pear Hill. Both the Snake Goddess race and the human race fully put their trust in her.</p>

  <p>With that, the people of the Pear Hill finally calmed down.</p>

  <p>At the same time, on one of the peaks, Feng Ge was standing there with a surprised look on her face as she heard the Snake Goddess mention Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>It had been a while when she last saw him. She didn't expect that Zheng's inner world had already grown so large.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Finally, the Pear Hill started to slowly enter the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Everyone's attention was caught as they saw rows of plants that resembled bamboo shoots above.</p>

  <p>As the primitive land continued to expand, these plants also grew bigger and stronger. If they pressed down, the entire Pear Hill would be instantly crushed.</p>

  <p>The entire process of sending the Pear Hill inside the primitive land lasted for about sixteen hours. Once it was done, Zheng said to Kendrick, "Master Kendrick, please remove your enchanted barrier."</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier that was attached to the surface of the Pear Hill gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>A wave then came from the vast blood mist in the sky, and slender plants emerged from the sea.</p>

  <p>The plants flew up from all directions, drilled into the bottom part of the Pear Hill, and firmly fixed it to the ground of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Zheng's inner world would continue to expand, meaning that some unpredictable dangers might occur. To prevent the Pear Hill from rolling further inside, the ancestry-level bloodline came up with this method to stabilize its hold on the primitive land.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I actually have a question if you don't mind. What are you now?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi asked as he approached Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Is there something wrong with me?" Zheng asked with a confused look on his face.</p>

  <p>"Well, since you are now in your own inner world, doesn't that make you an avatar?" Fuxi tried to explain with a smile.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others looked at Zheng as they heard Fuxi asking him this question. They were also curious about this.</p>

  <p>Zheng was now inside his own inner world.</p>

  <p>It was like saying that a big cup was holding a small gourd, but at the same time, the big cup was inside the small gourd. This would create a logic paradox. Was the cup the one holding the gourd, or was it the other way around?</p>

  <p>However, it was truly happening right now.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, one thing's for sure. This body is not my avatar." Then Zheng pointed to the space beside him and said, "But this is."</p>

  <p>Upon saying those words, an avatar that took his image gradually condensed. The aura emitted by the avatar was exactly the same as his.</p>

  <p>Soon after, more and more avatars appeared one by one.</p>

  <p>In a short while, there were over a hundred avatars that stood beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>Each of them possessed extraordinary strength.</p>

  <p>"Really?!" Fuxi exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Although Fuxi's strength had already increased dramatically, he instantly perceived that he wouldn't be able to deal easily with even one of those avatars. Even if they didn't use any theurgy, Zheng's avatars could kill Fuxi effortlessly. And to think that Zheng could easily summon over a hundred of them, one could just imagine how strong Zheng had finally become.</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems that we will become members of Zheng's inner world."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"The battle in the chaos has far exceeded our imagination," the Snake Goddess said calmly. Zheng stood beside her, listening intently to what she was saying with furrowed brows.</p>

  <p>"The Pear Hill is lucky to have this world to serve as its shelter.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill is lucky to have this world to serve as its shelter.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill is lucky to have this world to serve as its shelter."</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised when he heard that the Snake Goddess's words repeated a few times.</p>

  <p>He felt a strange wave run through his head. He was holding his head as if he was experiencing a mild headache.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, what happened? Are you alright?" The Snake Goddess instantly noticed that Zheng was acting a little strange.</p>

  <p>Zheng just shook his head and said, "Yes, I'm fine."</p>

  <p>He then waved his hand, making all his avatars disappear.</p>

  <p>With his current state, he shouldn't have any auditory hallucinations. He thought that perhaps it was because he summoned too many avatars at the same time.</p>

  <p>However, just when he dispersed his avatars, he noticed that there were shadows all over the sky.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the Snake Goddess beside him, there were also more than a dozen shadows that surrounded her.</p>

  <p>He tried to look around and he saw that there were more than ten shadows of Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>'What's going on? Why is the world full of shadows?!'</p>
