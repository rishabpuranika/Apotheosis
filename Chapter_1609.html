<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1609 Running Ants </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant's fist was the size of a palace.</p>

  <p>Even as Coleman was up ten feet high, compared to the huge fist, he was an ant.</p>

  <p>The power in the Lava Giant's punch was completely oppressive� it was likely that even with a light strike, anyone would be shattered to pieces.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng's divine weapon body was no exception.</p>

  <p>Such kind of Law Creatures were strong enough to contend against the Spirit Transformation Realm warriors, and even world lords.</p>

  <p id="top_7">The Lava Giants being assigned to the fourth Hall of Causality was proof of the terrifying difficulty of the fourth Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>But because of this, everyone wanted to conquer this fourth hall even more. With such difficulty, the reward for passing it must be extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The only hope they had to pass through this hall was that the Lava Giant wasn't particularly intelligent. If it had the smarts of a regular adult, it would be near impossible to pass through the Hall of Causality even if there were seven hundred warriors there.</p>

  <p>Still, their actions were undoubtedly crazy and risky.</p>

  <p>People didn't truly die in the Illusion Battlefield, after all, so everyone could make as huge a gamble as they needed to.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As the fist came crashing down, it was as if the ground had just been struck by an earthquake of high magnitudes. The solid ground surged forth like a wave.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just that the ground was shaking� the entire cave, the entire Hall of Causality, and even the entire majestic mountain was vibrating.</p>

  <p>"What powerful strength� Even the full force of my dragon scales is inferior to this Lava Giant."</p>

  <p>Zheng's confidence in his own strength came from the cyan dragon, but he hadn't fully activated the power of the dragon scales. The Lava Giant in the Hall of Causality could fight against a world lord with its full power far exceeding that of the latter.</p>

  <p>Under such force, it was only the heavens' restrictions that kept the cave from collapsing even as it fiercely shook.</p>

  <p>In the nick of time, Janet retracted the Lofty Wood and placed a hand atop the Frosty Cage� she could feel the flame kitten trembling.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Janet quickly retreated with her feet crossed left and right, her soft waist twisting like a snake, her toes flashing with a green light. After the light flashed, grass quickly grew from the ground, leaving a bright green path in her wake.</p>

  <p>Such was her clan's unique technique� Deer Steps.</p>

  <p>But they didn't want to avoid the giant. Having spent so much effort luring the giant closer, they wanted to use the Lava Giant to get across this magma lake.</p>

  <p>"Go! We only have one chance. Jump up on its arm."</p>

  <p>When the giant's fist came crashing down, the momentum was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether it was Jeffrey, Hailey, or the others, they were inevitably filled with hesitation.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng roared as he took the lead. His body drew an arc in the air as he smoothly climbed up the Lava Giant's arm.</p>

  <p>Just as he stood there, he felt a strong, burning sensation beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>But the flames of the giant were hidden within its body� it wouldn't cause Luo Zheng any harm.</p>

  <p>Hailey, Jeffrey, Janet, and the other two martial artists who followed closely behind, used their life vitality to protect themselves and jumped right onto its fist. The warriors just moved faster and rushed along the arm.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Hey! You guys, wait for me!"</p>

  <p>As Coleman gawked at the giant fist, he realized that there was no one around him. When he recovered from his daze, he immediately realized that if he didn't keep up, he would be easily abandoned there. The forceful energy in his body exploded at that moment as he picked up his speed.</p>

  <p>In truth, Coleman had extraordinary strength. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to accumulate five million Illusion Points. But compared to Luo Zheng, Janet, Hailey, and Jeffrey, he was clearly the weakest one.</p>

  <p>Under the eruption of the forceful energy, Coleman's speed increased almost explosively. In the blink of an eye, he'd arrived right behind Jeffrey.</p>

  <p>The seven warriors were basically small ants, constantly running along the Lava Giant's body.</p>

  <p>"Janet! Give me the Frosty Cage!" Zheng's body flashed as he leaned against her and reached out to grab the cage.</p>

  <p>Although everyone had climbed onto the Lava Giant's body, the latter didn't seem to have much interest in them. Even though Luo Zheng had used his longbow to shoot an arrow at the Lava Giant, it wouldn't have gained him any reaction. Its only target was the flame kitten� Luo Zheng wanted to take initiative and take on the responsibility of luring the Lava Giant in.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng reached out his hand, Janet put away the Frosty Cage and said, "Let me do it. Only I can control the Lofty Wood. Don't worry. I can handle it!" She smiled gratefully at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Alright. Be careful!" Just as Luo Zheng finished speaking, he heard the Lava Giant's voice once again. "Woo! Woo!" With a low growl, the Lava Giant raised its left hand to swat at its right shoulder.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Lava Giant's left hand suddenly strike down, the warriors shot toward its shoulder even faster than before.</p>

  <p>When everyone ran along the Lava Giant's arm, it was as though they were running on a very gentle mountain slope. Because it had previously thrown a punch, its right arm was almost flat. The arm slowly went up vertically, increasing the mountain slope's angle, basically turning it into a vertical cliff face. The bottom of the cliff face was then covered by the overwhelming magma.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the surface of the Lava Giant wasn't smooth� there were many cracks and bumps for everyone to use to make their way back up.</p>

  <p>Though the Lava Giant's left hand was probably reaching toward Janet alone, the range of its palm could easily cover all seven of them.</p>

  <p>"Jump!"</p>

  <p>Holding the Frosty Cage, with a shout, Janet's agile figure suddenly shot up a hundred feet as she leapt onto the Lava Giant's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Following behind her were Luo Zheng, Hailey, and Jeffrey.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>Roaring furiously, Coleman had two balls of black forceful energy burst out from under his feet, launching himself into the sky.</p>

  <p>Because one couldn't fly in the Hall of Causality, Coleman used the explosive impact of his forceful energy to throw his body high into the air until he landed headfirst onto the Lava Giant's broad shoulder.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Coleman's head fell right into a crack on the Lava Giant's shoulder. His head was stuck, roasted by the flames within the crack. With a cry of pain, he pulled his head out of the crack with much force. By then, half of his brown whip-like hair was already burnt to a crisp</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Right then, the Lava Giant's left hand had already made it to the top of its right arm. Under its powerful strike, countless stone fragments scattered from its arm. Under such immense pressure, some of the fragments shot out like concealed weapons, producing a sharp, whistling sound in the air.</p>

  <p>Drip! Drip! Drip!</p>

  <p>Most of the stone chips fell into the magma below!</p>

  <p>"Go! Keep moving forward," Luo Zheng called out.</p>

  <p>None of them stopped� they had to use this Lava Giant as a bridge to get them across the magma lake.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the Lava Giant didn't manage to land a hit on Janet. With a twist of its huge head, it opened its mouth and bit at the crowd on its shoulder.</p>

  <p>It seemed like that it was going to swallow all the warriors in one go.</p>

  <p>However, it actually had only one target, the little flame kitten in Janet's hand.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant's mouth was a thousand feet wide� it was a gigantic cave with an unfathomable bottom when it was opened. Looking into the mouth, one could see the light of fire reflected off the throat. The Lava Giant's stomach was probably filled with lava as well.</p>

  <p>"Everyone jump up again, don't get swallowed!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the large mouth make its move, he took the lead and leapt right onto the Lava Giant's head.</p>

  <p>Janet then inserted the end of the Lofty Wood into the ground to let it start growing rapidly.</p>

  <p>Grabbing the other end of the Lofty Wood, Janet was pushed by it, with the Frosty Cage in her hand.</p>
