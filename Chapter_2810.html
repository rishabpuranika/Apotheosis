<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The red lotuses that surrounded Zheng quickly turned into a sea of fire.</p>

  <p>Shining bright like the sun, its fiery light threatened to burn the eyes of anyone who would dare to take a glance at it.</p>

  <p>Using one's spiritual sense wouldn't help, and it would also be burnt to ashes. It was impossible to find out whether Zheng was fine.</p>

  <p>"Samuel, why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>He wanted to kill Zheng as soon as possible, but Samuel's abnormal behavior led him to doubt him as well.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, I just have a grudge against that guy," Samuel sneered. As he tightened his grip on the Spear of Supreme Harmony, a powerful force of Space Law began to spread out from his location.</p>

  <p>Samuel had planned to take action after most of the members from the powerful clans on the Floating Islands died. However, since both that woman and Nicholas already forced him to fight, he had no other choice but to make a move against them.</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>With that, Samuel stepped forward.</p>

  <p>As the power of the Space Law emerged from the surface of the Spear of Supreme Harmony, he had already appeared behind the girl with the blue eyes.</p>

  <p>Though these two girls had terrible means, they only had the intelligence of a four or five-year-old child after all.</p>

  <p>Since Samuel had the formidable Spear of Supreme Harmony, both girls could not pose any threat to him at all. Instead, they became his most powerful weapons!</p>

  <p>Secretly descending behind the girl with blue eyes, Samuel looked towards Nicholas with a sneer. "But I have a deeper grudge against you!"</p>

  <p>With that, he once again stabbed the girl with blue eyes with the Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The Spear of Supreme Harmony created a space channel, immediately devouring the blue-eyed girl afterwards.</p>

  <p>The next moment, the girl with blue eyes was sent beside Nicholas.</p>

  <p>A cold air spread out from her body, as countless ice flowers surrounded her, completely freezing all the energy around her.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was slightly stunned upon hearing Samuel's resentful words. He was not expecting that from him.</p>

  <p>Seeing Samuel stab the spear towards the girl with blue eyes, Nicholas seemed to have guessed his next move. Shocked, he turned into a ray of light and flew towards the distance.</p>

  <p>However, even if Nicholas anticipated the attack and left in advance, one of the ice flowers still managed to touch his body.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Half of his body was frozen in an instant, making him stiff and unable to move.</p>

  <p>Looking at the bright side, his situation was not as bad as the others.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah and two Demi-holy Beings were trapped in the ice flowers. They were frozen to death without making any sound.</p>

  <p>Seeing Jeremiah turn into an ice sculpture, Nicholas looked extremely indignant.</p>

  <p>His body suddenly trembled, spreading the internal momentum into his meridians and forcing the cold air out of his body. At the same time, he asked Samuel, "Why?"</p>

  <p>His question made the others turn towards Samuel with puzzled looks in their faces.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Abyss Demon Region, Samuel still flattered Nicholas all the time. They found it odd that his attitude suddenly changed. It seemed that his resentment came from a deeper grudge.</p>

  <p>With his figure suddenly disappearing, Samuel appeared about one thousand feet above the girl with blue eyes, and stabbed her again with his long spear.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The blue-eyed girl fell into the space channel again. As Samuel swung the Spear of Supreme Harmony fiercely, another space channel was opened out towards Nicholas, the cold air spurting out from it.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Nicholas could do nothing but step back again.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Samuel wanted to deal with Nicholas only, the others decided to leave them alone.</p>

  <p>"Do you still remember the Yue Clan that you pushed into the Time Sea?</p>

  <p>Do you still remember me, Gregorio Yue?" Samuel laughed coldly with deep resentment in his voice, making the people shudder with fear.</p>

  <p>In fact, Samuel had never planned to reveal his real identity this early. He was waiting for a perfect opportunity.</p>

  <p>However, as the alliance of powerful clans went deeper into the Abyss Demon Region, the situation became more complicated, apparently not meeting his expectation.</p>

  <p>For example, he hadn't expected Zheng to appear. To add up, the woman from the Sea of Meditation also messed up the situation.</p>

  <p>Now, with the appearance of these two girls, he finally found a chance to control the overall situation.</p>

  <p>"Gregorio? Who is that?"</p>

  <p>Several young consummate True Gods got confused at that moment. The name didn't even ring a bell.</p>

  <p>In addition, because of Nicholas' orders, the surname "Yue" had been banned in the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Most of the consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings had lived for a long time. Hearing the name "Gregorio", they got shocked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>"The universe of Gregorio has been destroyed a long time ago. How can he still be alive?"</p>

  <p>"Samuel is just talking nonsense!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings did not believe Samuel's words at all.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, reincarnation was believed to only be a legend.</p>

  <p>Only a few people knew the secret of the Stone Mouse. Also, no one else knew the existence of the Reincarnation Land, let alone stepped into it.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods had a consensus that the reincarnation didn't exist.</p>

  <p>Having Gregorio reincarnated into Samuel was against their common sense.</p>

  <p>Nicholas retreated for about ten thousand feet again. Looking at Samuel, he asked in a surprised tone, "Gregorio? That's impossible! I killed him in person in the past, and destroyed his universe. How could he still live in this world?"</p>

  <p>Now that Samuel had nothing to hide, he laughed harder as he revealed,</p>

  <p>"Because my mouse can take control of the reincarnation! It helped me be reincarnated!"</p>

  <p>"The Stone Mouse can really control reincarnation?" Nicholas asked, raising his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>It was believed that Gregorio's Stone Mouse was related with reincarnation.</p>

  <p>That Stone Mouse could be reborn, but Nicholas never imagined that it could help Gregorio be reincarnated with the Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>"In other words, you have been reincarnated to the Han Clan and also become a Holy Being." Nicholas murmured, "But you didn't seem to realize that you are Gregorio before, right?"</p>

  <p>Samuel was very arrogant when he just became a Holy Being. He had no intention of joining the alliance of powerful clans, and his attitude had changed only during these few decades.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was puzzled about this fact.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I really didn't realize it in the past," Samuel said and laughed coldly.</p>

  <p>"It is the Stone Mouse that has awakened my memory. Are you still feeling confused? I can tell you all about it, as I won't let you die without making sure you know everything."</p>

  <p>Staring at Samuel, Nicholas said with a grin, "Are you so confident in killing me?"</p>

  <p>The Spear of Supreme Harmony that Samuel was holding started trembling suddenly, its black shadow spreading out. The Spear of Supreme Harmony didn't just have the ability to activate the spatial transference. It contained great power too.</p>

  <p>Samuel started to laugh coldly. "Killing you is just a starting point. After I inherit the True Demon Body, I will destroy all Floating Islands and universes. By then, no one in the entire divine land will be on par with me!"</p>
