<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The vast majority of those who participated in the test were all abnormally excited. Eager expressions could be seen on their faces.</p>

  <p>Proving godly warriors were not rare in the divine land. As for the majority of the divine citizens, if they wanted to cultivate up to the world lord realm, it would not be too difficult for them to reach that level even if they just relied on their willpower. The real difficulty was in the cultivation of the Godly Way and the ability to condense a Godly Tile, which only a few people could do. If one could enter the Heavenly Han House, they would be helped by the Heavenly Han House. As such, the achievement of such difficult tasks would be more attainable. Once they could condense the Godly Tile and get an infinite lifespan, they would have a bright future.</p>

  <p>Thus, a considerable number of proving godly warriors participated in the test of the Heavenly Han House. They all wanted to see if they could pass nearly every year. Only a few of them would pass each year.</p>

  <p>However, they still didn't give up hope. They would usually try again next year.</p>

  <p>On the platform at the side of the arena, five proving godly warriors either stood or sat. Those five people occasionally glanced down at the black mass of proving godly warriors. Disdain was apparent in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Brother, why are these divine citizens so excited? Over a hundred thousand people are fighting for over twenty places. Are they all here just to take the test for fun?" Among the five people, a man asked with a smile. An arrogant expression could be seen in his face. That person was Seth Han, who was ranked third on the list of examinees of the Heavenly Han House's test.</p>

  <p>"You're right, they might not have viewed themselves objectively,"</p>

  <p>Hector Han said with a smile. He was the oldest and ranked second among the Han Clan's branch families, so they all respected him.</p>

  <p>Additionally, he was also ranked second on the list.</p>

  <p>"Humph, I don't know if the fourth-ranked person will appear, but I do want to see the person that pushed my ranking down," Zane Han, who was on the far right, said indignantly. A sour expression accompanied his bitter remark.</p>

  <p>Zane had originally been ranked fourth on the list, but recently, the incident that happened in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant was spread all over the city. It was said that a mysterious young man had suddenly appeared. Not only did the young man know how to make the Original Pure Food Pill, but he also had defeated Eric of the Hulan Clan with one move.</p>

  <p>That was the reason why Zane had been pushed down one rank by the mysterious young man. Zane, of course, felt quite displeased. Hatred seethed deep inside him.</p>

  <p>"Eric was only ranked eleventh and that mysterious youth defeated him and then ranked fourth. That is indeed unfair," Seth said as he shook his head. However, curiosity about the mysterious young man had entered his head.</p>

  <p>"I think so too."</p>

  <p>"Those people who made the name list originally rely only on catching groundless information. Since most of the information comes from rumors, it is impossible to make the rankings accurately..."</p>

  <p>Since they were from the same clan, they naturally upheld Zane. It was just as what they had said, Eric was indeed only ranked eleven on the name list. However, who of the Han Clan's disciples present could defeat him in one move? Eric still had high popularity and dignity within the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Moreover, anyone with a keen eye could tell that the day in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, Zheng had defeated Eric without any effort. Such a feat would definitely boost his popularity.</p>

  <p>People who compiled the name list together also relied on the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Every time the Heavenly Han House's test was held, they would send people with sharp eyes to gather information in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant. Those people only ranked Zane, Seth, and the others at the top because they were afraid that Han Clan might feel embarrassed.</p>

  <p>However, what happened in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant had really moved them. If they were to judge by their sharp sense, no one on the list could compare to Zheng!</p>

  <p>The old man whose surname was Wu was abnormally busy today as well. Even as a True God who taught disciples the Godly Way, he still had to help arrange things during the test of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>As he busied himself with his work, his gaze wandered around the crowd. As a True God, although he was average in strength, it was easy for him to find someone amongst the 100, 000 people present. His keen eyesight wandered through the crowd in search of someone.</p>

  <p>After he searched for a while, the old man shook his head and let out a soft sigh. He wasn't able to find the warrior he wanted to see. That Tianxing didn't participate in the test today.</p>

  <p>The old man surnamed Wu had spent the past few days trying to eliminate the 'two taboos' based on the mystical method that Zheng had taught him.</p>

  <p>Although he only cultivated it for few days, it actually showed a little effect. He had a stubborn personality and did not like to owe favors to others. Even after Tianxing taught him such an impressive technique, he had only given him a place to take the test. That was too petty of him.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the old man surnamed Wu, Tianxing couldn't enter the Heavenly Han House. Nonetheless, he still wanted to return Tianxing the favor. If Tianxing came today to take the test, then he would have a valuable gift for him.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he didn't see Tianxing. The old man thought that Tianxing had lost his confidence and directly chose to give up. That kind of thing happened very often in the Heavenly Han House's test. Warriors would usually suffer from stage fright and retreat from the test.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a loud discussion among the crowd was heard. The proving godly warriors all suddenly chattered about a person who just arrived.</p>

  <p>"Is it really him?"</p>

  <p>"The one that defeated Eric in one move? Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"He looks so ordinary..."</p>
