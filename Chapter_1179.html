<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The thin line in the sky appeared all of a sudden. However, the moment it came into view, everyone, including Luo Zheng himself, froze on spot as if immobilized.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a great Mu Ning within seconds. The Mu Ning seemed to surpass the limits of living beings.</p>

  <p>They felt their bodies solidify and their blood stop circulating. Their hearts stopped beating and only their consciousness remained working.</p>

  <p>They felt that their souls were, under this thin line, like insignificant specks of dust.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"How can something be so powerful? It is only a thin line, but I can already feel its might!"</p>

  <p>"I'm insignificant. I feel like nobody at all."</p>

  <p>Each and every Soul Sea Realm master had lived for tens of thousands of years. They had long lifespans, wide ranges of knowledge, and exceptionally mature minds. Their warrior spirits were meant to be as solid as rocks.</p>

  <p>However, the warrior spirits of some of the Soul Sea Realm masters started to show signs of breakdown under the power of the thin line.</p>

  <p>Its power was unleashed against Luo Zheng. The others were still some distance away from him and only he was bearing the brunt of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head and gazed ahead at the thin line. A cold expression covered his face. "Cyan dragon, what is that?" Luo Zheng did not think too much of it. At the moment, he felt like he was facing a life and death situation, so he immediately inquired the cyan dragon about it. At the very least, he wanted to know if he had a way to escape this obstacle.</p>

  <p>However, the cyan dragon simply said, "I don't know."</p>

  <p>Even the cyan dragon had not seen such a thing previously. He was indeed unable to answer Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>But soon, Luo Zheng came to know what it was.</p>

  <p>The thin line continued to extend several tens of feet in the sky. Soon after, it split into two. As the two lines separated, their heads and ends still connected; they formed an eye socket. In the center of this eye socket was a black eye.</p>

  <p>An eye!</p>

  <p>There were perhaps tens of thousands of species in the universe. Each of them had distinct appearances, but there was one similarity that they all shared� the eye.</p>

  <p>"It's an eye. Whose eye is that?" Zheng's brows furrowed, a look of caution on his face. He did not feel any goodwill radiating from the eye. On the contrary, he felt a sharp hostility coming off it.</p>

  <p>'No. Perhaps it can't be called hostility, ' Luo Zheng thought. 'I don't qualify to make it feel hostile to me. I'm insignificant. The eye appeared simply because its master is curious about me. The hostility must come from instinct. As long as the eye's master wants it, he or she could kill me in an instant!'</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze met the eye as he stood rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>A moment later, the eye blinked, and a black beam of light shot out from its pupil.</p>

  <p>The eye then blinked twice again and disappeared into thin air. However, the black light was still present. It flew off and continued to refract in the air as it approached Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whether it was Derek or the other Soul Sea Realm masters, none of them dared say a word. Their faces were deathly pale as they looked at the black light flashing in the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just released the Lotus Flower. For many of the Soul Sea Realm masters, he was their only hope to ascend to the Upper World. If anyone attempted to take Zheng's life, they would waste no second in killing the opponent. In their eyes, Luo Zheng had become the key to ascend to the Upper World. They would protect him at all costs.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, none of them moved.</p>

  <p>They were horror-struck watching the black light flash and could not even muster the thought of attacking it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The black light soon covered a distance of dozens of feet and changed directions once again. It changed its direction before extending another seventy to eighty feet. It refracted several times, but its distance from Luo Zheng was constantly narrowing. It was only a matter of time before it reached him.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng possibly face this black beam of light?</p>

  <p>He didn't have much time left and he knew that he wouldn't be able to withstand the black light. His life vitality wouldn't stand a chance. His sacred weapon's physique wouldn't do. His Stellar Body would be too weak against it. His hope relied only on the will of the world.</p>

  <p>'I suppose I can transfer the attack of the black light to the whole world, ' he thought. Suddenly, a far-fetched idea entered his brain.</p>

  <p>Although the eye's strength could possibly destroy the entire world effortlessly, Luo Zheng had no other choice but transfer the power to this world.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng closed his eyes and lost in his own thoughts. He tried to frantically absorb the memories in his mind; the memories that the will of the world had projected onto him.</p>

  <p>Quickly, he tried searching for the memories of all the mountains in the world.</p>

  <p>Mountains...</p>

  <p>In the Eastern Region, there were the Hell Mountain, the Dragon Mountain, the Thirty-three Peaks, and the vast northern mountains.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, there were the Nine-dragon Mountain, western mountain range, and over 10, 000 other mountains.</p>

  <p>There were a total of 730, 000 mountains in the entirety of the Sky Northern Region.</p>

  <p>About 1.3 million mountains on the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>860, 000 mountains on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>In addition, there were numerous other mountain ranges on various desolate islands.</p>

  <p>There was also a land of savagery larger than the Divine Kingdom Continent, home to over 2 million mountains.</p>

  <p>He could count a total of more than 5 million mountains!</p>

  <p>With just a thought, Luo Zheng had counted the mountains of the world.</p>

  <p>After some pondering, Luo Zheng decided not to transfer the power of the black light to the Eastern Region. Just before it surged toward Luo Zheng, he activated the strength transfer.</p>

  <p>"Since I am the representative of this world, I should have the right to rule it. I hope you can help me overcome this crisis," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>The "you" he was addressing to was the will of this world.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had fused himself with the will of the entire world, he still could not be considered its master. He had no way of resisting the black light and could only rely on the world to help him out.</p>

  <p>Of course, the will of the world was the gathering of all life forms in this world. It wasn't a single entity or a specific thought. Even though the little monster had been the incarnation of the world's will, he himself hadn't known about this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only uttered the words out of regard for the living beings of this world and the respect he had for himself.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the black light shot at him.</p>

  <p>Everyone present could only stare blankly at the scene before them.</p>

  <p>Seeing this black light, no one had thoughts of attacking it, for there was nothing they could do at all.</p>

  <p>The black light hit Zheng's chest in an instant and entered his body rapidly.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, his entire body, including his lips, the whites of his eyes, his nails, as well as his clothes� all turned black.</p>

  <p>As this black light traveled across Zheng's body, it instantly wrapped around each cell to destroy it. If the insides of Zheng's body had been on display, everyone would have noticed that his brain, organs, bones, blood vessels, and every drop of his blood had turned black.</p>

  <p>It was an attempt to wipe Luo Zheng out. If the black light succeeded, not a single hair or cell in his body would be left in this world. Not a single granule of his body would remain.</p>

  <p>In one breath, a singularly terrifying power had been released.</p>

  <p>The cells and parts of Zheng's body tried to tolerate the immense impact of the energy.</p>

  <p>As the energy of the black light began to expand, the first mountain began to collapse.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>It was a mountain in the western part of Central Region that had endured the huge amount of energy and exploded from the inside, but not a single rock rolled down. Before it could collapse completely, it had disappeared.</p>
