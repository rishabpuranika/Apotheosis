<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As they peered straight into each other's eyes, Luo Zheng could feel enormous pressure weighing down on him.</p>

  <p>But there was something else he noticed.</p>

  <p>As he looked into the Black Weasel's eyes, apart from the oppressive sensation, Luo Zheng didn't pick up any killing intent.</p>

  <p>If the Black Weasel was truly a spiritual pet nurtured by the Holy Being, then it had endless ways to kill him in a blink� it could probably take down everyone present in a single move.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had no idea what it was up to so he couldn't ignore his nervousness. By now, Chapman had already decided to give up on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The young man was too impulsive, but if he died in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the strength source he had obtained would return to this world.</p>

  <p>After a long moment of staring at each other, the Black Weasel suddenly raised its head and roared into the sky. For a moment, it threw a glare at Luo Zheng with its red eyes before walking away, disappearing into the forest.</p>

  <p>No one dared move even when the weasel's body had completely disappeared from view. Only when they heard the sound of heavy footsteps fading away did they feel relieved. "Huff�"</p>

  <p>Though Chapman released a breath, his expression didn't look at ease.</p>

  <p>But as the leader, he couldn't just point a finger at Luo Zheng for risking their lives� he had to consider the situation as a whole.</p>

  <p>But one of the members of the Collapsing Mountain race suddenly jumped up.</p>

  <p>Nimble as an ape, he reached out his hand and aimed at Liusu's head� he wanted to kill her on the spot.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race believed that Han Liusu was Pascal's sister and they were aware of the Han Clan's status in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The large Han Clan was on par with the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but so what? If they couldn't leave the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, then everything else would have been for nothing.</p>

  <p>So Luo Zheng was the Collapsing Mountain race's last hope. With this woman by his side, they'd all be in danger. "Aran! Don't be rash!" Chapman's expression turned alert.</p>

  <p>Obviously, this warrior called Aran wasn't good-tempered as Chapman was.</p>

  <p>Just now, they were almost killed by the Martial Sacred Beast because of this woman.</p>

  <p>Now, all he wanted was to take Han Liusu down. But he hadn't considered Zheng's thoughts.</p>

  <p>Luckily, before he got Han Liusu within his reach, Kennan and his companions stood their ground in front of Han Liusu and blocked Aran off. "Get out of my way!" Aran roared coldly.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death!" Kennan hadn't expected the warrior to suddenly take action� they would not show mercy to him.</p>

  <p>Among the warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race, Aran was on equal footing with Chapman in terms of strength. Although he couldn't carry a Heavenly Destiny in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, in terms of pure strength, Aran's was almost the same as that of a Supreme Lord who specialized in body refining.</p>

  <p>Under the impact of his strong body, how could the world lords hope to block him?</p>

  <p>With a mere touch from Aran, two of the world lords had their internal organs displaced instantly and they fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>But Kennan and the other world lords all came from the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the divine land warriors, physical strength was merely a measure of a martial artist's power. But in a fight, it usually came down to a warrior's holistic strength. No matter how powerful one's pure physical strength was, it didn't equal invincibility. One could find many other ways to either avoid attacks of physical strength or weaken their opponents' strength.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his finger, Kennan made an S-shaped emerald jade appear on his left hand. When he pressed the jade with his finger and drew in air, a fishing net appeared before him out of thin air� it was as light as a feather. It began wandering in the air like willow catkins until it enveloped Aran completely.</p>

  <p>The moment Aran was enveloped, all the strength in his body was sapped. Suddenly, his attack came to a halt and his entire body turned soft to the point where he could barely remain standing.</p>

  <p>"This fishing net�" Zheng's gaze froze.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng hadn't used the power of the nine stars, his strength would have been far inferior to this warrior of the Divinity Hunt Squad. The fishing net was extremely magical. How did it manage to drain the Collapsing Mountain warrior's strength to such an extent?</p>

  <p>"That's the Strength Reincarnating Net," Han Liusu explained, noticing Zheng's puzzled expression. "It's a supreme primordial weapon� it can completely absorb one's strength and reincarnate it into each thread of the net."</p>

  <p>In other words, after the net had absorbed Aran's strength, it exerted the strength back onto Aran. The greater the victim's strength, the greater counterforce it had� Aran was trapped.</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing the scene, Chapman heaved a sigh of relief. Being too hot-tempered, Aran was inches away from making a grave mistake.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was willing to risk his life to protect Han Liusu� he wouldn't back down in the face of Aran's attack.</p>

  <p>Later, under Chapman's meditation, Kennan removed the net entrapping Aran when the latter gave up the thought of killing Han Liusu under Chapman's persuasion.</p>

  <p>"Alright, we can go on our way," Han Liusu announced with a smile.</p>

  <p>Resting on Zheng's back, she wasn't feeling nervous at all. In fact, she felt a strong sense of security.</p>

  <p>With a nod, Luo Zheng replied, "Then when are you going to get down from my back�"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu merely stuck out her tongue and slid down Zheng's figure.</p>

  <p>After going through the Martial Sacred Beast crisis, the martial artists from other races turned much more obedient� having finally made some achievements in cultivation within the Collapsing Mountain race, no one was willing to lose their lives so easily. The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was originally quite a strange place. If they weren't careful enough and lost their lives because of it, they only had their bad luck to blame.</p>

  <p>The group had somehow stabilized and with the Collapsing Mountain race's rich experience, they went through the rest of the journey more smoothly.</p>

  <p>On the way, they encountered a few strange beasts. The Tiger Hunt Squad and the Dragon Hunt Squad personally dealt with them and killed them.</p>

  <p>But after they crossed the forest of giant tress, they entered the Calamity Dispelling Forest� the number of strange beasts seemed to increase. So long as they didn't encounter something like the Martial Sacred Beast, it wasn't so much of a problem for them. Even beasts like the Formless Sky Python, the Divine Hunt Squad could deal with them� there was nothing to be afraid of.</p>

  <p>After about fourteen hours, the groups passed through the Calamity Dispelling Forest. In front of them, appeared a wondrous scene� a river that stretched across the very sky.</p>

  <p>The broad river was completely suspended in air, meandering all the way across the sky like a snake without a head or tail.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be dark soon. Everyone should pick up the pace. After we pass through this Sky Enlightenment River, we'll reach the Skyland race's territory," a Collapsing Mountain warrior remarked.</p>

  <p>Day and night in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were completely different. Powerful existences like the Formless Sky Python usually came out at night, but the Martial Sacred Beast was an exception.</p>

  <p>"The Skyland race? Why are we headed there?" one of the other warriors questioned.</p>

  <p>"This is a joint operation by the three sacred places. Why do you still have so many questions?" the Collapsing Mountain warrior responded coldly, staring indifferently at the warrior who asked the question. Seeing that it was a warrior from another race that had joined the Snake Hunt Squad, the Collapsing Mountain warrior just didn't bother to explain much to him.</p>

  <p>If it was the kind of hunting in the past, they would have already made it back to the Collapsing Mountain race by now. But this time, it was different� they had crossed the Calamity Dispelling Forest and were going to gather in the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Apart from the Skyland race, there was also the Harmony race who would join this mission.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, the aboriginals of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had already planned to take action numerous times, but now, the three races had joined their forces.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race had long since spread the news about Luo Zheng to the Harmony race and the Skyland race. They referred to Luo Zheng as the 'flame-proof warrior, ' attributing how he was unafraid of fire. He was the key to achieving their goals.</p>

  <p>While the Collapsing Mountain race still refused to reveal what they wanted Luo Zheng to take for them, Chapman had guaranteed time and time again that the three races would do their best to protect Luo Zheng from harm.</p>

  <p>The moment everyone made it across the river in the sky, they felt a strong wave of life vitality pass through them� they had reached the Skyland race's territory.</p>

  <p>Here, warriors could cultivate Pristine Life Vitality and the Skyland race was a sacred place for warriors cultivating life vitality.</p>

  <p>But the martial artists of the Collapsing Mountain race mainly focused on body refining. Some of them cultivated both body and life vitality, but still, they didn't have much interest in the Pristine Life Vitality of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Zheng's situation was a bit special� although he also had built his inner world, the life vitality within his body had been replaced by chaotic energy, rendering the place's life vitality useless to him.</p>

  <p>But the attributes of chaotic energy and life vitality were rather similar. If the Skyland race had some special methods to use life vitality, Luo Zheng could still absorb and learn some of the methods.</p>

  <p>Soon after they entered the territory of the Skyland race, several troops arrived to welcome them.</p>

  <p>Their warriors had a build similar to that of human warriors. But their eyes were sunken, their hair golden, and on their backs, every one of them had a pair of pure white wings. Like the Collapsing Mountain race, they dressed simply and crudely, with only a few pieces of cloth covering their private parts, exposing their strong figures.</p>
