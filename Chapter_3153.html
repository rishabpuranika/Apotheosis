  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng looked around, he realized that the architectural styles of the temples here were different from what he'd seen before.</p>

  <p>Come to think of it, the temples Luo Zheng had seen on Stage One each had different styles, too. It seemed they were built in different eras.</p>

  <p>After all, every race had their own unique aesthetic, so it only made sense that the styles of buildings varied.</p>

  <p>However, the four temples that loomed before him were different from each other, but all were of the human style.</p>

  <p>"These temples... were built by humans?" Luo Zheng asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Ling Shuang nodded. "Most of the mighty races build their temples on Stage Four. Some weaker forces can only build their temples on Stage Two or Stage Three, and the weakest nonhuman races are limited to Stage One..."</p>

  <p>Because there were many races in the Source World, establishing a temple on Stage Four was a way to assert their power.</p>

  <p>"So, are you saying, Stage Four is the liveliest place?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is. Just follow me, you'll know soon enough," Ling Shuang smiled.</p>

  <p>Following closely behind Ling Shuang, Luo Zheng continued to examine the four temples, three of which represented the three orthodox human forces. But what about the fourth temple?</p>

  <p>"There are three orthodox forces in human race and each one has a temple here. Then who owns the fourth one?" Luo Zheng voiced his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You should have guessed it by now," Ling Shuang said nonchalantly. "It's the one that is always on your mind."</p>

  <p>'The Nine Li race...' Luo Zheng thought in his mind.</p>

  <p>There once had been four orthodox forces in human race, but only three of them remained.</p>

  <p>By taking advantage of the Jin Wu's invasion, Qiu Yinhe had found out Luo Zheng's background, but those of the Origin Mountain didn't know it.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't stop Ling Shuang and the others from guessing. After all, they were able to piece things together from things Luo Zheng said, intentionally or unintentionally.</p>

  <p>"Oh, guessed what?" Luo Zheng suddenly laughed.</p>

  <p>"Are you still playing dumb?" Ling Shuang pouted. "Am I so untrustworthy?"</p>

  <p>Even though they had been through many life and death situations together, Luo Zheng had never revealed his origin to her. For some reason, this upset Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hesitated. Since Qiu Yinhe already knew his background, and since the Taiyi Heaven Palace wasn't exactly the enemy of the Nine Li race, there was no need to hide it from Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, if one was too cautious and secretive, they were bound to lose the trust of the others. Even Luo Zheng himself would be on guard against a person whose background was unknown to him.</p>

  <p>"It's sort of what you think," he said after a while. "But I can't talk about it right now. If there's a chance in the future, then trust me: I will tell you all the things you should know."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, without turning around, Ling Shuang quickened her pace. Luo Zheng began to worry that she might be vexed with him.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to grab her by the arm, she suddenly looked back at him from over her shoulder, giggling. "Did you really mean what you said just now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned by Ling Shuang's sudden mood swings. Having difficulty adapting to the situation, he ended up saying, "Yes, you have my word."</p>

  <p>Then, she proceeded to tell him about the temples.</p>

  <p>In the olden days, the human race was weak. The four orthodox human forces had no choice but to unite in order to survive. This became a precious era of peace and harmony.</p>

  <p>During this time, four temples of the human race were built.</p>

  <p>Besides the four temples on Stage Four, on the higher stages of the Other Shore, the four human forces also had their temples lined up together.</p>

  <p>However, the harmonious state did not last forever. The dispute between Nine Li race and Bearing race led to a huge fight.</p>

  <p>The conflict between the two races wasn't enough to affect the entire human race, though.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Taiyi Heaven Palace decided to stand by and not interfere.</p>

  <p>The Eastern Emperor Taiyi believed that it was nothing but a silly quarrel, and that nothing serious would happen.</p>

  <p>After all, besides the human race, there were many other powerful races in the Source World. If the battle went on for too long, it would only benefit the other races. Even Chiyou shared the same sentiments at the time.</p>

  <p>The war between the two races was much like the one between the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Jin Wu. The battles were limited to one province. It was more like a trial for the two races than a full-fledged war.</p>

  <p>However, once the Divine Farmer race got involved, everything changed.</p>

  <p>Under the joint attack of the two orthodox human forces, the Nine Li race was doomed. With Chiyou's death, the whole Source World was shocked.</p>

  <p>After all, it wasn't simple to form a super power; conversely, it wasn't easy to annihilate one. However, with the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer joining hands, they made it happen.</p>

  <p>Since their fall, the temples of the Nine Li race on the Other Shore were then occupied by the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"What's the reaction of the Taiyi Heaven Palace after the Nine Li race was annihilated?" Luo Zheng asked with brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't say anything, but he paid a visit to the Li Shan mountain," Ling Shuang said.</p>

  <p>Then, it clicked. Luo Zheng finally understood what had happened.</p>

  <p>The reason behind the conflict between the different forces of human race boiled down to the different ways they had chosen to live by.</p>

  <p>Those top masters were so powerful, and they all had strong will and great ambitions. There was no way they'd back down so easily and change the way they had chosen.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew clearly that he could not confront the joint force of Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer all by himself. If he did not join them, he had to find a new ally.</p>

  <p>Both the Li Shan mountain and the Taiyi Heaven Palace had chosen the same way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had known about this from Qiu Yinhe. Now it was confirmed here by Ling Shuang again, which made him even more relieved.</p>

  <p>He had chosen to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace by accident. And now it turned out that it was the right choice.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 might also know about all this, but it never disclosed everything clearly to Luo Zheng. It just subtly guided him to the way that suited him.</p>

  <p>They talked in a low voice while walking until they reached the square in front of the temples.</p>

  <p>Originally, each of the four temples had a statue positioned in the front. In front of the temple that belonged to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, there was a massive marble statue of a sword. For the Bearing race, there was a ferocious bear statue. In front of the Divine Farmer race's temple, there was a statue of a huge ruler.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he saw that the statue for the last temple had been destroyed. Only two legs remained.</p>

  <p>Even if he had never been here before, he knew without a doubt that it was Chiyou's statue--with three heads and three pairs of arms. Now, it had been destroyed and was barely discernible. Luo Zheng sighed sadly.</p>

  <p>But what piqued his interest was the huge ruler that stood in front of the temple of the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>It was so detailed, almost lifelike. It actually looked similar to his Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>"What is the story of that?" Luo Zheng asked, pointing at the statue of the ruler.</p>

  <p>"It's the Divine Farmer Ruler," Ling Shuang replied instantly. This was just common knowledge. But since Luo Zheng was a newcomer in the Source World, she had already gotten used to his ignorance.</p>

  <p>'What's the connection between the Divine Farmer Ruler and the Infinity Ruler?' Luo Zheng wondered in his mind. But on second thought, since the members of the Divine Farmer race had made a statue of Divine Farmer Ruler as a token to worship, it must have an extraordinary origin. It might be ridiculous to try to draw a connection between the two.</p>

  <p>When the two finally arrived at the gate of the Taiyi Heaven Palace's temple, two guards blocked their way. "If your are disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, we need to confirm your identity!"</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang calmly raised her arm, and the square space ring in her hand flashed with bright light.</p>

  <p>One of them stepped aside and said politely, "You may enter." Then, turning to Luo Zheng, he said, "We also have to verify your identity."</p>

  <p>Everyone on the Other Shore couldn't see each other's appearance, and they could only identify each other by their scent. Thus, it was only natural they couldn't tell who Luo Zheng was.</p>
