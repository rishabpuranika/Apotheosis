<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Other Shore Power hidden in the statue of the horse head wasn't strong.</p>

  <p>It had less than one divine megaton of force, but it was still enough to be regarded as an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"You can endow the statue with Other Shore Power?" Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>King Manard nodded and held the statue in his hand. "The Other Shore Power is not directly from me. It's from the outside of the chaos and my hand is just acting as a medium," he explained.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power was an extremely special existence. However, no one had expected that the power did not come from the chaos itself, but outside of it.</p>

  <p>As King Manard gently waved his hand, the Other Shore Power that was hidden in the statue grew stronger and stronger, gradually surpassing one divine megaton.</p>

  <p>"If the Other Shore Power comes from somewhere outside of the chaos, then is it possible that there's a way to exit the chaos from the Other Shore?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked as he stared closely at the statue.</p>

  <p>King Manard shook his head and said, "I'm not actually sure, but you're probably right. It's just that some of the secrets are hidden deep in Stage Thirty Three. Unfortunately, we weren't able to uncover them even when we were at the height of power."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power in the statue finally stopped increasing after reaching thirty divine megatons. "I only acquired thirty divine megatons of force from the Abstruse Energy World. Luckily, I've found some secrets in that world. My disciples and I should be making a breakthrough but it will take some time."</p>

  <p>"It's difficult to search outside the chaos, isn't it?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>King Manard nodded and said, "Yes, it is indeed difficult. We are creatures born in the chaos, so we are not allowed to enter the Abstruse Energy World. Now that I think of it, the only one who might be truly suitable for that world would be the first civilization, the Instant Civilization."</p>

  <p>In the Abstruse Energy World, time and space did not exist.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Instant Civilization only existed promptly. Time and space were meaningless to them.</p>

  <p>Then Zheng remembered that the Regal Jade Spirit had once told him about the characteristics of the Instant Civilization. Upon contemplating, he realized that there might be a relationship between the two. "Is it possible that the Instant Civilization was from the Abstruse Energy World?" he blurted out.</p>

  <p>"You're sharp. Yes, they were from the Abstruse Energy World."</p>

  <p>The complexity of the entire chaos was far beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to reveal all the secrets it contained.</p>

  <p>Despite this, King Manard had told Zheng many things he needed to know.</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?" Zheng asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>Since he had been exiled into this space, his priority was to quickly find a way to get out. He didn't expect that he would be able to encounter such an opportunity during his stay.</p>

  <p>Since he was already here, King Manard would need him to do something in return.</p>

  <p>"If you want to return so badly, you have to meet one condition," King Manard asserted as he stared at him intently.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng responded without any hint of hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction. When you return to the chaos, I need you to find the human race on the Other Shore," King Manard answered.</p>

  <p>He had actually waited for so long before an opportunity like Zheng came along. There was no way that he would just let him go that easily.</p>

  <p>King Manard was the absolute ruler of this space. Even the Chaos Ancient God, who had mastered the space truth, couldn't disobey or spy on him. In return, he was not able to leave the space.</p>

  <p>He wanted Zheng to cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction, and then Zheng could freely get in and out of this space.</p>

  <p>"Find the human race on the Other Shore?" A trace of confusion appeared in Zheng's eyes as he asked further, "Where am I supposed to look for them?"</p>

  <p>"You have to figure out this on your own. The human race in this round of chaos was not born by chance. Your very existence means that the human race on the Other Shore have already begun to take action," King Manard answered as he gave a meaningful look.</p>

  <p>After saying that, he turned around and gently stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>Several golden bricks started to fall.</p>

  <p>The golden bricks quickly piled up and turned into a tall wall, surrounding Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was an inscribed word on every golden brick, and the wall they created told the cultivation method for the Truth of Three-energy Construction.</p>

  <p>"I will only send you back after you have fully comprehended the Truth of Three-energy Construction. That will be our deal." King Manard's voice resounded from the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>The golden wall also kept No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit on the other side.</p>

  <p>Zheng could actually teach both of them the Truth of Three-energy Construction after he had mastered it. However, King Manard detested the other races so much that he didn't allow them to observe the cultivation process of the Truth of Three-energy Construction. In fact, if he wasn't being nice to them, he might have killed them already.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if I would be compatible with it," Zheng muttered from inside the wall.</p>

  <p>"If you can't make it in a year, do it in ten years. If you still can't do it in ten years, you have a hundred years. I can give you all the time you need to comprehend it. Even if you're not compatible with it, you'll still be able to cultivate it eventually," King Manard replied firmly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that, Zheng pursed his lips and stared at the words on the brick wall.</p>

  <p>He already realized that King Manard would not let him out if he didn't master the Truth of Three-energy Construction.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, King Manard was in full control of the time of this space. Zheng had nothing to worry about the time he would consume before he mastered it.</p>

  <p>As No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit were waiting outside, they were quietly communicating with each other through their consciousness.</p>

  <p>"If Zheng masters the Truth of Three-energy Construction, then he will be able to merge with the Other Shore Tokens in this space, right? If King Manard gives himself the Other Shore Power and turns himself into an Other Shore Token, he will be able to enter the chaos with Zheng's help, won't he?" No. 9527 told its idea with its consciousness.</p>

  <p>"That's right. But do you seriously think that a proud human like him would agree to become someone else's Other Shore Token?" the Regal Jade Spirit answered while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Even the creatures on the Other Shore thought that it was shameful to become Other Shore Tokens. A powerful being like King Manard would naturally be unwilling to become one. Perhaps, he had another idea on how he could return to the chaos.</p>

  <p>"That makes more sense." No. 9527 nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>These two Sons of Truth had seldom communicated before. Although No. 9527 was just a strand of soul, it represented a Chaos Ancient God. The Regal Jade Spirit was also a Chaos Ancient God in the past, but he represented a civilization on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Though they shared the same goal of realizing the Finale Way, they were still always on high alert.</p>

  <p>After they shared this communication, they became closer.</p>

  <p>At the same time, King Manard took his two disciples back to the other side of the palace.</p>

  <p>"Master, with my exceptional talent, I've still spent a year and a half to be completely well-versed in the Truth of Three-energy Construction. It will take dozens of years for Zheng to achieve it, right?" the handsome man said arrogantly.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Three-energy Construction was much more difficult to grasp than the incomplete Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. It was said to be a complete Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The handsome man was a one-in-a-million talent that King Manard had personally selected. It was such a fascinating display of skill for him to master the Truth of Three-energy Construction in less than two years.</p>
