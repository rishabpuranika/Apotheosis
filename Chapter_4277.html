  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng saw that the woman was protected inside an invisible enchanted barrier. The huge heads moved along the edge of the barrier, trying to chomp at her.</p>

  <p>They scrambled almost desperately, trying to devour the woman, but the barrier stopped them from doing so.</p>

  <p>The woman was stoic and emotionless, closing her eyes slightly, so Zheng could barely make out whether she had the pupils of a snake.</p>

  <p>But this didn't matter. The woman had a striking resemblance to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to withdraw his consciousness, the woman's eyes suddenly popped open. Her golden pupils revealed a trace of confusion mixed with wonder.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, creatures of the fourth-grade world shouldn't have been able to sense the aura of the Illusory Vision, since the consciousness transmitted in this way was a very small wisp and was activated in the Soul Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was an exception, only because he had also grasped the power of the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>As for this woman, she was a snake spirit. Among the Four Spirits Sect, the snake spirits had the most acute perception.</p>

  <p>Upon sensing the faint disturbance, she immediately could tell that someone was there, despite it being extremely difficult to detect where it was exactly.</p>

  <p>"Is someone spying on me again?" she wondered aloud. "If yes, then that would be good news for me...</p>

  <p>Things shouldn't go the way my father says they should go," she continued, a trace of anger in her voice. "He said that he can control the overall situation of the chaos, but I bet he must have been met with opposition. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Narrowing her hatred-filled eyes, she shouted, "If you are someone who opposes him, please-- stop at nothing to kill my father!"</p>

  <p>Her voice rang throughout the space, and Zheng could tangibly feel her anger.</p>

  <p>While she might've been the daughter of the Snake Spirit King, she had grown up in the Human Spirit Sect. All of her skills were taught by the human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House. The only thing that Cornelius had ever given her was the Evil Bead that hovered above her, which had been his wedding gift to her.</p>

  <p>No matter how she viewed it, it was a great honor for her to receive a Holy Item from her father.</p>

  <p>It had even made her siblings seethe with jealousy.</p>

  <p>That was the only time she ever felt some semblance of affection from her father.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, she later realized that the Evil Bead was not a gift at all, but a weapon in disguise. It was hidden within her body, which was all part of Cornelius's grand plan.</p>

  <p>When the four sects fought fiercely in the chaos, her father had demanded her to fight by his side.</p>

  <p>She had refused to submit, even if it meant she had to die.</p>

  <p>From the moment Kincaid was killed, she viewed her father as a horrendous enemy.</p>

  <p>While she was painfully aware that she personally would never be able to exact her revenge, she still wished she'd live to see the day her father would regret his actions.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt the strong hatred emanating from her, but he couldn't communicate with her through the Illusory Vision. The only thing he could do was listen, then silently retract his consciousness.</p>

  <p>Upon deactivating the Soul Extreme Form, Zheng's replica closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, on the jadeite platform, Zheng slowly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Kincaid, and Hilario had been waiting anxiously by his side.</p>

  <p>When they saw him wake up, they all gazed at him inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"I found her," said Zheng, clearly reading their expressions.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Kincaid, and Hilario silently rejoiced at this news.</p>

  <p>"How is Itzel? Is she okay?" Kincaid asked, his tone tinged with worry.</p>

  <p>"She looks unharmed, but she bears a strong hatred for the Snake Spirit King," Zheng answered. He then recounted what he had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>When he was finished, Kincaid lowered his gaze and his eyes dimmed.</p>

  <p>After a while, he finally asked, "Can we save her?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>Zheng replied enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>Two hours later...</p>

  <p>The primitive land, which had been moving consistently in the chaos, suddenly changed course and headed straight into the depths of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, in the Source World...</p>

  <p>The Evil God was ordering people to build a new palace.</p>

  <p>What they had built so far resembled a huge, black pyramid. It was somewhat bleak in appearance; there seemed to be nothing special about it.</p>

  <p>When the palace was finally completed, his will suddenly reverberated throughout the entire Source World, like a pulse in the earth.</p>

  <p>He invited all the powerful warriors in the Source World to come to visit him in his newly built palace.</p>

  <p>More than two hundred warriors in total showed up, including many Holy Soul Realm warriors, Eternal Realm warriors, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and even Duran.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With a loud noise, the gates of the palace slowly creaked open.</p>

  <p>Then, a complex aura of energy streamed forth from the gates.</p>

  <p>When the Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors felt this aura, their gazes were drawn towards the palace interior. There, they saw that the ceiling of the hall was inlaid with countless triangular crystals, each of which containing the energy of a specific Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"The three thousand Godly Ways?"</p>

  <p>"What's the point of extracting the energy of the three thousand Godly Ways?"</p>

  <p>"What is he planning to do?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors eyed the ceiling warily, all confused as to what was going on.</p>

  <p>If they had been given enough time, it wouldn't have taken much effort for them to grasp all three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the power of the Other Shore Tokens was regarded as superior, while the Godly Ways were usually cast to the side.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran remained silent. By then, they had already guessed what the Evil God was up to.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please go upstairs from the staircase behind the hall," the Evil God's voice boomed, echoing throughout the hall.</p>

  <p>Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven led the way, and all the other warriors followed behind them.</p>

  <p>Upon climbing the stairs, they found the Evil God standing in the center of the hall on the second floor. However, no one stared at him too long.</p>

  <p>What really drew their attention was what was on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Countless diamond-shaped crystals were embedded on the ceiling, with different kinds of energy flowing within them. Everyone was familiar with this aura: they were the bloodline powers!</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! There are so many bloodline powers!"</p>

  <p>"One, two, three... They are three hundred and seventy-three in total!"</p>

  <p>"Are these all the bloodline powers in the world?"</p>

  <p>Holy Soul Realm warriors never had the chance to even encounter the bloodline powers. Even Eternal Realm warriors could, at most, get a root-level bloodline in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Their powers paled in comparison to the ones embedded in the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Chaos suddenly broke loose among the warriors. It was as though a group of beggars encountered a cave filled with gold and silver treasures.</p>

  <p>Everyone eyed the crystals greedily, and a somewhat stiff tension filled the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>It was only Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven who remained calm amidst the chaos, as they had already predicted this. However, internally they were both shocked to see the complete bloodline powers neatly arranged on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"You can each select a specific bloodline power." The Evil God smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll give them to you as a gift."</p>

  <p>His words were music to their ears.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Evil God assumed control over the Source World, the warriors of different races had been dissatisfied with his rule. However, they wouldn't have stood a chance if they dared oppose him, so they had only grumbled under their breaths.</p>

  <p>Now that the Evil God was so generous with the bloodline powers, the dissatisfaction in their minds instantly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Before these Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors could express their gratitude, the Evil God turned to the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran. "Please follow me to the third floor."</p>

  <p>Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven exchanged surprised looks.</p>

  <p>At that moment, they both had guessed what was going on.</p>

  <p>Without saying a word, they followed the Evil God upstairs and entered a hall on the third floor.</p>

  <p>This time, the ceiling was embedded with countless rings. However, these rings were empty; no energy flowed within them.</p>

  <p>At a glance, Duran's sharp eyes had counted the number of rings. There were one hundred and forty in total.</p>

  <p>Just as he'd finished counting, the Evil God raised his head slowly.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...</p>

  <p>One after another, the rings lit up, until the ceiling was covered in glowing rings.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, all kinds of Extreme Form energy now streamed within the rings!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's mouth hung open in shock as he sensed the Extreme Form energies in the rings.</p>

  <p>"This, this..." he stuttered.</p>

  <p>"Are these all the kinds of energy from the Deep Space?"</p>

  <p>Because the two of them had witnessed the Evil God's restoration of the Extreme Form energy from the Deep Space, they knew what to expect.</p>

  <p>While they had already mentally prepared themselves for this scene, they were still unable to conceal their excitement at the sight of so many kinds of Extreme Form energy.</p>

  <p>"I can teach you how to grasp any kind of Extreme Form energy.</p>

  <p>However..." The Evil God suddenly frowned. "The consumption of power when you use the Extreme Form energy is significant. Even I can't use them for long..."</p>
