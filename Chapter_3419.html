<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The figures of the three brothers from the Divine Farmer race were blurred, which made them look like ghosts floating in the air.</p>

  <p>The techniques the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had used before just passed through their bodies without affecting them.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Realm, however, had a big flaw. They needed to maintain a subtle balance with the help of the Dark Realm Stone. The balance could get broken if they weren't careful, which was why they moved carefully and at an incredibly slow pace.</p>

  <p>Like a mere pebble thrown into a lake, the green starlight was so weak that it could not cause any real harm to the warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>However, it did not pass through their bodies like other people's attacks.</p>

  <p>Instead, it hit the three brothers.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The second the starlight bloomed, the three figures were shattered like broken glass. The surface of their bodies broke into numerous cracks and fragments.</p>

  <p>After the fragments fell from the surface of their bodies, they stumbled out of the Shadow Realm.</p>

  <p>The three of them obviously didn't expect that a bit of ordinary looking starlight could cause such an effect.</p>

  <p>Even Feng Ge, Dorothy, and the others were speechless in shock. After all, the Falling Star Palm's power was so weak that nobody really paid attention to it. It was unbelievable that it could deflate the Shadow Realm so easily.</p>

  <p>"It is about the energy level," whispered Chaim. Truthfully, he was more confused than anyone else.</p>

  <p>He didn't feel any Other Shore Power when Zheng had released the starlight, but he saw Zheng summon a green cubic crystal.</p>

  <p>That crystal was not the internal momentum of the Godly Way, nor was it visualized with life vitality. The only possible answer was that it was Zheng's blood power.</p>

  <p>Yet, the blood power could only reach level three. Some weak blood power was at the same energy level as the internal momentum of the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Zheng's was different, so what kind of blood did he have?</p>

  <p>That was only Chaim's guess by instinct, but it was very close to the truth.</p>

  <p>But if his memory served him right, it was impossible for many super forces to have such a high level of blood power.</p>

  <p>The three brothers were also dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>They weren't weak at all, but how could the three of them defend against so many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace?</p>

  <p>The moment the Shadow Realm was destroyed, one of them flipped his hands and two ghostly machetes materialized. He then used the two machetes to attack Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of anyone at this distance.</p>

  <p>Once the machetes reached Zheng, Zheng's hands suddenly turned black. He raised them up, and two loud bangs followed. He immediately grasped the machetes' blades and effectively stopped the two weapons.</p>

  <p>"His hands..." Across Zheng, his opponent was so surprised that his eyes almost popped out.</p>

  <p>Zheng glared at him. When his Other Shore Power surged out, he suddenly twisted his hands, and the two machetes were distorted into pieces. If the man hadn't loosened his hands in time, his arms would've also been mangled.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Since the attack failed, the three of them gave up on their plan and moved to the other side.</p>

  <p>Currently, the people of the Divine Farmer race, along with the other large races, were dealing with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Still, they kept in mind that as long as they were with their clansmen, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace wouldn't dare to offend them.</p>

  <p>However, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace didn't allow them to escape.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Dorothy, and Milo launched an attack almost at the same time. The messy sword radiance formed a wall and covered the three brothers.</p>

  <p>The three brothers' faces paled in fear when they saw the sharp and powerful sword radiance. "I, I will return the Chaotic Source Spirits to you.</p>

  <p>Don't, don't kill me!" one of them shouted.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace present were not born yesterday, so they all knew clearly how important the Chaotic Source Spirits were.</p>

  <p>They had risked their lives to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits, but these pesky men had snatched them. Now, they asked for forgiveness after Zheng had forced them to return the Chaotic Source Spirits like it was nothing.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for them, there was no such thing as easy in the world.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who dares to steal our Chaotic Source Spirits will lose their lives,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said indifferently as he stood still. There was no need for him to fight personally now.</p>

  <p>Just as the net of sword radiance surrounded the three brothers, a figure fell from the sky and landed beside them.</p>

  <p>"Protection!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Then, he stretched out his hands and a brownish yellow mountain shadow spread out from his body. The shadow immediately enveloped him and the three brothers.</p>

  <p>"Clank! Clank! Clank!"</p>

  <p>There was a series of crisp, metallic clanks as the sword radiance hit the mountain shadow. It sounded like someone repeatedly knocked a big bell.</p>

  <p>The man was known as Mount, and he was from the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>"We are faced with a strong enemy right now. Why do we have to kill each other?" Mount said calmly.</p>

  <p>It was known that he came from a very mysterious background, but he was now the strongest warrior in the Divine Farmer race, only second to Mya.</p>

  <p>While he fought against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, he saw his clansmen were being surrounded by the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. Thus, he immediately rushed over to stop their attack.</p>

  <p>"Kill each other? Do you really have the nerve to say this?" Feng Ge retorted angrily. "These three men took away our Chaotic Source Spirits. They have a death wish. You can't blame us!"</p>

  <p>Mount frowned as Feng Ge rebuked his words. He didn't expect that the three brothers would do such a thing. He calmly said, "Ismail, give the Chaotic Source Spirits back to them."</p>

  <p>Since Mount appeared when the three brothers were in danger, they became arrogant once again.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer race wasn't afraid of the Oneness Sky Palace. Moreover, they had the full support of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race and more.</p>

  <p>If these disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace dared to coerce them, they would only bring about their own destruction.</p>

  <p>Yet when Ismail, the eldest of the three brothers, was about to taunt Feng Ge, Mount asked them to return the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"Why? We are not afraid of them!" Ismail refused, defiance written all over his face. Zheng, Yan, Feng Ge, Dorothy, and the others looked at them grimly.</p>

  <p>A murderous look flashed across their eyes. It seemed that it was useless to talk to these men.</p>

  <p>"Just do what I say! Stop talking nonsense!" an enraged Mount suddenly yelled.</p>

  <p>The younger generation of the Divine Farmer race was very afraid of Mount, but he was very gentle in manner. No one had ever seen him lose his temper before.</p>

  <p>The three brothers felt their hearts sink when they felt Mount's anger. They quickly poured out the Chaotic Source Spirits from their space rings.</p>

  <p>Ismail was reluctant to return the Chaotic Source Spirits, but he dared not disobey Mount.</p>

  <p>Just as Mount was about to leave with the three brothers, Zheng coldly said,</p>

  <p>"That's all? Do you think this thing is settled after you've returned the Chaotic Source Spirits?"</p>

  <p>In turn, Mount stared at Zheng blankly while the three brothers angrily said,</p>

  <p>"We have given back the Chaotic Source Spirits. What else do you want?"</p>
