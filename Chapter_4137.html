<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had been a small fight within the Land of Consciousness.</p>

  <p>Anyone at the Holy Soul Realm could deal with the Evil God, and the black snake here without any difficulty.</p>

  <p>However, because the Land of Consciousness was different, any powerful figures could not enter it. Even formidable beings such as the Evil God and the black snake could not unleash their full soul force within the land.</p>

  <p>The fight had caused great disaster in the Source World though.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God and the little black snake had contaminated the consciousness of the Source World, many dramatic changes began to take place in the provinces.</p>

  <p>When the creatures began to fight using their powerful minds, the consciousness of the Source World quickly fell into great chaos and disorder.</p>

  <p>Booming crashes echoed harshly.</p>

  <p>The crystal walls surrounding the Grey Fish Province shattered into pieces, and its fragments scattered in all directions. The jagged pieces rained down on the provinces nearby, wounding and piercing through countless creatures.</p>

  <p>The oceans of the Wood Province surged and rolled, the water evaporating to form a thick vapor that smothered the entire province.</p>

  <p>Within the Ice Province the ground had cracked to divide the land into many parts.</p>

  <p>Numerous kinds of strange phenomena were taking place all over the provinces. As a result, countless inhabitants in those places were either injured or dead.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate then that the phenomena did not last long.</p>

  <p>It had taken eight hours, but the Source World finally returned to a peaceful state.</p>

  <p>The Land of Consciousness though was in a mess.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the little black snake was a part of the Snake Spirit King's soul, his time within the Land of Consciousness was too short compared to that of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Nearly half of the Source World's consciousness had been corrupted by the Evil God, while the black snake had only been able to pollute a small portion of it.</p>

  <p>The black snake might have been far stronger than the Evil God, but he still fell at the hand of the latter.</p>

  <p>The only reason the Evil God had won was his strategy to use the Source World's own consciousness against the snake.</p>

  <p>Lost in thought, the Evil God stared down at the dead snake as he contemplated devouring his soul for his power.</p>

  <p>He of course had the ability to absorb souls, so it shouldn't pose an issue.</p>

  <p>After another moment of short consideration, the Evil God controlled his greed and decided against it.</p>

  <p>The little black snake was too mysterious, too much of an unknown.</p>

  <p>There was really no telling what would happen if he devoured his soul.</p>

  <p>It was much too risky to take the chance.</p>

  <p>So he picked up the snake and tossed him over his shoulder to disappear in the Land of Consciousness.</p>

  <p>An ear-splitting roar suddenly split the sky. It came from the Heavenly Square City of the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Cornelius was going ballistic.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's body lay across the whole city, but he always tried to remain unseen within the city.</p>

  <p>He entrusted most of his affairs to the Snake Masters. Majority of the creatures within the city didn't know of his existence.</p>

  <p>The roar had caused some sections of the space to collapse, forming large, jagged cracks. From the cracks crawled numerous Treacherous Beings and creatures from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As they all looked up to the sky, a monstrous snake head was glaring down at them.</p>

  <p>Cornelius hissed sharply at them, commanding their attention.</p>

  <p>Fury was evident in his eyes. A slimy, forked tongue flicked from his mouth, and his crescent-shaped eyes glinted with dark golden light.</p>

  <p>The human spirits of the Joy, Broad and Black Houses walked out of the Heavenly Square City and stared blankly up at the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"What has the Snake Spirit King so angry?"</p>

  <p>"This is the first time I've ever seen him throw a tantrum..."</p>

  <p>"Hopefully he won't decide to take it out on us."</p>

  <p>Even though the human spirits had always been loyal to the Snake Spirit King, they still feared his wrath.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Joy House, Alphonse observed the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>He felt a trickle of happiness inch down his spine, but he made sure to show no outward sign of the emotion.</p>

  <p>Alphonse thought about what the king's anger might mean for them. It could mean his original plan failed, or something stood in its way, so he had to strategize a new one. This could bode well for them.</p>

  <p>The Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House in the Ten Directions House of the Human Spirit Sect, had joined the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Both Gianni's and Alphonse's coordinates were in the hands of the Snake Masters.</p>

  <p>There was no way to take back their freedom without their coordinates.</p>

  <p>The air broke apart with a loud whooshing sound.</p>

  <p>Sewell had snapped his tail as he'd climbed to the top of the Heavenly Square City.</p>

  <p>"My king, what makes you so angry?" he asked, his voice shaking. He had seldom ever seen the king become so enraged.</p>

  <p>"A piece of my soul has failed his mission..." the Snake Spirit King snarled.</p>

  <p>Sewell raised his head abruptly, and looked at the Snake Spirit King in shock.</p>

  <p>Sewell knew exactly what had angered the king from those few words.</p>

  <p>The last time Sewell had witnessed the Evil God's display of power in the Blood Sea Province, he knew he was a danger to them. He had immediately reported everything to the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>At the time, the Snake Spirit King did not take his words seriously.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King had ruled over the chaos for an incredibly long time. Everything was under his strict control. But the unconscious Bird Spirit King and the recently awakened Monkey Spirit King unnerved him.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King believed the Chaos Ancient Gods and warriors of the Eternal Realm in the Source World were insignificant and did not deserve any thought or consideration.</p>

  <p>Sewell was assured though at the time by the Snake Spirit King's calm attitude.</p>

  <p>Even though the Evil God had control of the primitive land, Sewell believed that his king would be able to conquer it once more.</p>

  <p>But now that his king was admitting defeat, Sewell was drowning in the shock of it.</p>

  <p>'What are we going to do now?'</p>

  <p>Sewell, who was always calm, was unsure of what to do now.</p>

  <p>'The primitive land is a crucial part of our plan. It can't be in the hands of other people.'</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King regained his composure, and glanced down at the Treacherous Beings and creatures from the Other Shore that had gathered.</p>

  <p>"Take the coordinates of these Treacherous Beings to the Mist City. It is time to end the battle that has lasted hundreds of chaotic eras," he said.</p>

  <p>There was a flash of surprise in Sewell's eyes. "Wouldn't that be too rash, Your Majesty? Perhaps we should give it a little more thought, come up with a better idea," he tried.</p>

  <p>"This is not up for discussion! It is an order!" The Snake Spirit King spoke coldly, "If the Bird Masters know about the situation and react quickly, our plan that has lasted over a thousand chaotic eras would be ruined."</p>

  <p>The worst part of it all was not that the Evil God controlled the Source World. What scared the Snake Spirit King the most was the thought that the Bird Masters might learn how to utilize the Source World.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Snake Spirit King had to destroy that possibility at any cost.</p>

  <p>The battle in the Jade Pure Realm had lasted hundreds of chaotic eras because the coordinates of either side were in their respective strongholds.</p>

  <p>Both parties had battled many times, but they had never suffered any losses and the coordinates were the reason for that.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King had ordered the coordinates taken to the Mist City, and things were different now.</p>

  <p>While the Treacherous Beings on the side of the Snake Spirit Sect could come back to life within the Mist City, increasing the odds of the sect winning, it came with a massive risk.</p>

  <p>That way, if they were defeated, their coordinates would be erased by the Bird Masters and the people of the Snake Spirit Sect would be dead for good.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, Cornelius would never think to adopt this terrible strategy for it was too much of a risk.</p>

  <p>But the intervention of the Evil God left him no other choice.</p>
