  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you okay? Can you hear me?" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was obviously worried.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter how powerful Luo Zheng's body was. He still couldn't quite compare to the Treacherous Beings. He must have suffered a great deal after being hit by the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry about me," responded Luo Zheng. He winced just as he finished saying this.</p>

  <p>The problem was not the heavy sword itself, but this world. The rules in this place were completely modified.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he was very familiar with the modification of rules.</p>

  <p>The universe, the divine land, the Source World, and the Other Shore all had different sets of rules. They were set when these places were just constructed. But with enough strength, it would be possible for someone to alter them.</p>

  <p>It was the simplest to modify the rules of the inner world. For instance, it was fairly easy for Luo Zheng to change the rules in his primitive land.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the movements of the irregular heavy sword were extraordinarily fast. But with his token, he definitely could have avoided it.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the rules of this boundless world had been changed.</p>

  <p>Therefore, his token was totally useless. The space token he previously demonstrated was rendered ineffective.</p>

  <p>Swish! All of a sudden, he heard a strange rushing sound.</p>

  <p>The heavy armor that disappeared in the darkness reappeared unexpectedly. It reached out and made a gentle grabbing motion. At once, the irregular heavy sword returned to its hand.</p>

  <p>Afterward, there was a buzzing sound coming from where the heavy armor was.</p>

  <p>Buzz! From a distance, Luo Zheng saw peculiar lights shining one after another.</p>

  <p>The buzzing sound was apparently coming from those strange lights.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, those lights were actually coming from the runes embedded on the surface of the black armor. They were lighting up consequently.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the heavy armor seemed lifeless and impassive. After the runes lit up, it suddenly became full of vitality.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng confronted the armor a while ago, he merely treated it as a dead thing, although he could clearly sense the unpleasant aura of the Treacherous Being. He thought that his real opponent here was the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed as though the irregular heavy sword had summoned the black armor. Slowly, it was coming to life.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, two blood-red dots lit up within the armor's helmet. It gave the black armor a more menacing aura.</p>

  <p>"What in the world..."</p>

  <p>There was an unusually grave expression upon Luo Zheng's handsome face.</p>

  <p>This time, the black armor felt like a living person to him. Maybe it was even an exceptional top master.</p>

  <p>It radiated with a strong aura of life and soul. Meanwhile, the aura of the Treacherous Being still existed within the armor. He could even feel its strength. This meant that Kincaid had not awakened yet. However, Luo Zheng could not help it. He just had to ask. "Is that you, Master Kincaid?" he called out to the black armor.</p>

  <p>Kincaid was trapped within the Treacherous Being. When he heard Luo Zheng's question, he smiled bitterly. 'Yes and no, ' he thought silently.</p>

  <p>'I do not wish to kill you.</p>

  <p>But because I'm trapped in here, I have no choice.'</p>

  <p>Kincaid felt utterly helpless and downhearted.</p>

  <p>If he could just change his wish willfully, he wouldn't have to face such a shameful and unpleasant situation now.</p>

  <p>But then again, how could a wish be changed at will? If only he knew how.</p>

  <p>Swish! Once again, Luo Zheng heard a rushing noise.</p>

  <p>The black armor took a step forward and instantly disappeared from where it was standing. Out of nowhere, the irregular heavy sword slashed towards Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Actually, its speed was not that fast.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's speed had decreased a lot in this world. There was no way he could dodge this sword attack. His only option was to withstand it.</p>

  <p>Crash! The collision between the sword and Luo Zheng caused a loud crashing sound.</p>

  <p>He crossed his arms over his chest in a desperate attempt to block it. The sword effectively landed a hit, and the impact sent him flying again.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was still helplessly soaring in mid-air, the black armor appeared above him at an incredible speed. Boom!</p>

  <p>The sword hit him hard on his back. After that, he began to plummet to the ground.</p>

  <p>Swish! Hearing this, Luo Zheng already had an idea of what was about to happen.</p>

  <p>As he predicted, the black armor disappeared again. This time, it reappeared beneath Luo Zheng and pointed the irregular heavy sword upwards in an attempt to stab him once more.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng instantly thought that if the irregular heavy sword landed this hit, it would probably pierce through his body.</p>

  <p>"This time, I'm sure! I can avoid it! If I could just..."</p>

  <p>During the most crucial moment, the ancestry-level bloodline activated the ability of the space-time quadrant once again.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be able to change the basic rules of this space. However, it could immediately adapt to such rules.</p>

  <p>As soon as the power in Luo Zheng's elixir field emerged, he quickly disappeared. Shortly after, he reappeared dozens of miles away from his previous location.</p>

  <p>After his spatial transference, Luo Zheng did not stop. He continued to move further away.</p>

  <p>He went from ten to a hundred miles away. A few more seconds passed, and he was already a thousand miles away from the black armor.</p>

  <p>In just a short span of time, Luo Zheng had managed to move thousands of miles away. However, the entirety of this space seemed to have no end.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the black armor appeared as if it wasn't in a hurry to chase after him. It merely hovered in the air and waited patiently.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng was already ten thousand miles away from it, it took one step forward.</p>

  <p>Despite the vast distance between Luo Zheng and the armor, it still appeared precisely beside Luo Zheng. Obviously, it was perfectly in control of this entire space.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, Luo Zheng stepped back and tried to keep his distance.</p>

  <p>However, a strange thing occurred. As Luo Zheng retreated, he collided headfirst with the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Crash! A loud booming sound echoed throughout the space.</p>

  <p>The collision between Luo Zheng and the sword was so forceful that it left a huge dent on his forehead. The gash was an inch deep.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you alright? Answer me!" Once again, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, I..."</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could answer, the black armor had already moved to his left side. Naturally, he moved to the right to avoid it.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, he slammed once again onto the irregular heavy sword. It caused a deep gash on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, Luo Zheng's bones were extremely strong and hard. His body was also unbelievably tough. No blood gushed out from the wound.</p>

  <p>Finally, the ancestry-level bloodline gave him a helpful reminder. "The basic rules of this space are reversed. Therefore, the left and right, up and down, and the front and back directions are actually the other way around."</p>

  <p>"I see. So how should I deal with this?" Luo Zheng asked as he tried to think about his next move.</p>

  <p>"Here, let me adjust your perception!"</p>

  <p>A stream of life energy rose from the primitive land and flowed directly into Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>While this was happening, Luo Zheng's eyes began to flicker. All of a sudden, he felt dizzy. In the blink of an eye, the world was reversed.</p>

  <p>"Now, to the opposite direction..."</p>

  <p>The heavy black armor slashed at him again. This time, Luo Zheng's reaction was perfect. He was able to dodge the attack with ease.</p>

  <p>Inside the Treacherous Being's body, Kincaid was deep in thought. He started to process what he just witnessed.</p>

  <p>The Death Sword was able to make the basic rules.</p>

  <p>All living beings in this space had to follow the basic rules in order to survive.</p>

  <p>No one could ever go against the rules.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was still alive after battling with the sword for such a long time!</p>

  <p>Where on earth did he come from? How strong was he?</p>

  <p>This was completely beyond Kincaid's understanding. He couldn't quite figure out why.</p>

  <p>'I see. You can adapt to the rules that have already been changed by the Death Sword twice now. You really are as talented as I was in the past.</p>

  <p>But if it continuously changes the basic rules, you are going to be in grave danger, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Everyone's ability was limited and fixed. Perhaps Luo Zheng's bloodline power could withstand the twice revised basic rules purely by luck and coincidence. But if the Death Sword frequently adjusted the basic rules, in the end, he would still be killed.</p>

  <p>Kincaid wanted to warn Luo Zheng about this. Unfortunately, he couldn't.</p>

  <p>Just like Kincaid predicted, the irregular heavy sword modified the basic rules once more. Luo Zheng's body suddenly became awfully heavy. It seemed like it was made of lead. Moreover, the weight of all the materials in this world increased ten thousand times over.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't figure out the right technique, he would suffer another blow like last time.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline had also adapted. Whenever any of the basic rules were changed, it would use a new ability to help Luo Zheng adjust.</p>

  <p>When the rules were altered for the third time, it only took Luo Zheng a brief moment to readjust his perception.</p>

  <p>The black armor didn't quite expect that Luo Zheng would manage to adapt in such a short span of time. Nonetheless, it carried on with its assault.</p>

  <p>But this time, Luo Zheng was ready to fight back.</p>
