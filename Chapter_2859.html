<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2859 Luck </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Deep in the Swirl Forest, a ripple flowed on the surface of a pool.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Liusu emerged from the pool.</p>

  <p>A pair of over one hundred-foot long tentacles closely followed Liusu.</p>

  <p>The tentacles were covered with barbs, and each barb glinted with radiant light. Apparently, every one of them was laced with poison.</p>

  <p>The two tentacles rushed at Liusu at high speed. Liusu dodged them as she continued to hover over the water, the tips of her toes constantly touching the surface of the water. She maneuvered her dodges smoothly and quickly like a dragonfly.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Liusu, watch out!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey shouted, who was standing beside the pool.</p>

  <p>As this pair of tentacles were about to trap Liusu, a purple light streamed right from Liusu's eyes.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>A handful of purple preternatural flames spiraled out and wrapped her in.</p>

  <p>The fierce beast in the water seemed terrified of the preternatural flames protecting Liusu. It didn't dare to get close.</p>

  <p>"Caw!"</p>

  <p>The fierce beast let out a scream under the water. The water that was originally a pool of dark green turned into strong hue of blood red.</p>

  <p>Then a semicircle head that resembled a pot cover popped out of the water.</p>

  <p>Beneath the "pot cover" were wedge-shaped teeth laced with poison. As its figure emerged from the surface of the water, its poisoned teeth shot at Liusu covertly.</p>

  <p>It was only when Liusu noticed the poisoned teeth that her face revealed a trace of panic!</p>

  <p>Although Liusu was a consummate True God, she had reached such level of power because Samuel assisted her with the help of the Memory Flames. In terms of combat experience, Liusu was far inferior to the other consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The fierce beast under the water was called "Green Turbid Monster". Their number was few in the Swirl Forest but their strength was powerful. Only those at least at the consummation of True God Realm were able to fight against them.</p>

  <p>When the poisonous teeth were about to hit Liusu, space fluctuations appeared on the surface of her figure and she suddenly vanished. She had used the Grand Teleportation and appeared close to Geoffrey's side.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Green Turbid Monster was irritated at Liusu. Its huge body left the water and rushed directly to the two.</p>

  <p>"Caw!"</p>

  <p>It screamed in fury which was piercing to the ears. Then, it whipped out its tentacles, lashing at everything that was close to their proximity.</p>

  <p>At the very moment, a flash of crimson light streamed behind Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>The crimson light shot towards the Green Turbid Monster.</p>

  <p>It shot through the Green Turbid Monster's head without any sound, and pierced the huge tree at the other end of the pool, leaving an empty round hollow on the trunk.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>It was as if the huge beast's soul had been drained in an instant, and it fell into the water, creating layers of green ripples.</p>

  <p>"Grandma, you're amazing!" Turning his head, Geoffrey looked at Lorena happily.</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled faintly. "Well, you can go get the stuff in the pool now..."</p>

  <p>Hearing Lorena's words, Geoffrey dived into the water without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene, Augustus who stood not far away shook his head and sighed, "Poor Green Turbid Monster, you've suffered a lot this time. When you're reborn again, I'll find you a better place..."</p>

  <p>Over the years, Geoffrey's personality had become much more mature.</p>

  <p>However, Yudie and the others had pampered him too much, so his stubborn personality had not been worn off.</p>

  <p>He had read some books about the Swirl Forest and claimed that there might be treasures where the Green Turbid Monster appeared.</p>

  <p>Augustus, who controlled the Swirl Forest, knew that such a legend was completely nonsense.</p>

  <p>In history, it was true that a disciple of some powerful clan on a Floating Island obtained a supreme treasure of belief after killing the Green Turbid Monster. But that was pure luck.</p>

  <p>After knowing about the legend, Geoffrey had been pestering Augustus to take him to hunt treasures.</p>

  <p>Being tricked by Geoffrey for so many times, how could Augustus fulfill his wish? He had been avoiding Geoffrey in the fairy palace recently.</p>

  <p>But when the fairy palace started getting more visitors, one of whom was Geoffrey's grandmother, things started to change.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's grandmother, Lorena, gave the boy whatever he wanted, and with Liusu joining the treasure hunt, Augustus could only lament over the miserable fate of the fierce beasts in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop!"</p>

  <p>A series of bubbles appeared in the pool.</p>

  <p>Lorena stared at the water, looking for Geoffrey's figure at the bottom of the pool. She was trying to make sure Geoffrey was safe from harm.</p>

  <p>Despite being Zheng's mother, she was never there during Zheng's childhood nor his developing years. Therefore, she made a resolve to prioritize Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>In a short while, the water surface split, and Geoffrey emerged.</p>

  <p>"I told you there couldn't be any treasure..." Augustus stared at Geoffrey with a bored look, but as his eyes flashed, his gaze was fixed on Geoffrey's hand.</p>

  <p>There was a green stone in his hand.</p>

  <p>The stone shaped like an oval cobblestone. It exuded a strong energy force.</p>

  <p>"Haha, I knew there must be treasures in this pool!" Geoffrey swam towards the bank, tossed the stone to Lorena and said, "Granny, take a look at that stone! What is it?"</p>

  <p>Lorena examined the stone carefully, a hint of surprise evident in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She pressed her hand on the stone, feeling the energy force within it. She closed her eyes and infused her spiritual sense into it. She then opened her eyes, smiled and remarked, "This can be considered as a second-level supreme treasure of belief."</p>

  <p>Liusu's eyes widened in awe and said, "Geoffrey is so lucky! A second-level supreme treasure of belief! It's even rare on the Floating Islands!"</p>

  <p>Supreme treasures of belief were the essence of the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the level a supreme treasure of belief possessed, every treasure bore a unique effect. Every powerful clan deemed them with great importance.</p>

  <p>Augustus was speechless as he looked at the stone.</p>

  <p>After he controlled the Swirl Forest, he had searched all over the forest and only found three first-level supreme treasures of belief, and one second-level supreme treasure of belief.</p>

  <p>How was it so easy for the boy to find a supreme treasure of belief?</p>

  <p>Augustus couldn't help but spit in disdain, "That was just dumb luck..."</p>

  <p>Right after he spoke, he suddenly felt a very unique aura spread out from several dozens of miles away.</p>

  <p>A green vortex appeared in the sky. The peculiar energy it emitted immediately drew everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>"That's where Zheng cultivates... What method is it?" Augustus stared at the green vortex, and his eyelids twitched.</p>

  <p>When Lorena saw the green vortex, her eyes widened.</p>

  <p>It was this very green energy that broke the Furnace of Dark and Light in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had told them about everything after he left the divine land, he had never mentioned about this power.</p>

  <p>Since he never mentioned anything about this, Lorena didn't ask further questions. But even with her knowledge and experience, she could not tell the origin of this power.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is cultivating. We better not disturb him," said Lorena calmly.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, a green star rushed out of the vortex and fell into the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The ground trembled, and tremors spread miles away when the star hit the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the huge crater in front of him and said to himself, "The power of the Falling Star Palm depends on the number of Truth Crystals. But my Truth Crystal was inherited from the Chaos Ancient God. What can I do to increase the number of Truth Crystals?"</p>

  <p>He had defeated Nicholas in the Abyss Demon Region largely by relying on the Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>Before that, he had thought that the power of the Falling Star Palm was not strong enough, so he hadn't used it. But now, it seemed that it was still necessary to strengthen this technique.</p>
