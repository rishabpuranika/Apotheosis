<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If Zheng had been promised this when he had just entered the Source World, he would have agreed without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Back then he had quite a shallow understanding of the entire chaos and reviving the Nine Li race was all there was on his mind.</p>

  <p>But now, his horizons had been broadened and his knowledge expanded, so naturally his goals had changed as well.</p>

  <p>"Revive our Nine Li race and bring my grandfather back to life?" Zheng replied with a smile. "As far as I know, there isn't much time left in the current round of chaos. So what would be the purpose of me reviving the Nine Li race? It will be destroyed with the ending of the chaos anyway."</p>

  <p>The ruling civilizations present all nodded in agreement. When a round of chaos was coming to an end, all within it became meaningless.</p>

  <p>All substances would disappear and turn into the most primitive energy of the Great Unity, and all that had happened in the past would be reset.</p>

  <p>"Don't get too greedy," the Grandmaster of Heaven continued, trying to persuade him. "Even if the Nine Li race hadn't been annihilated but had existed up to now, they'd eventually be wiped out as well. The arrival of the finale of the chaos is inevitable and irreversible. When it comes time for the finale of the current round of chaos, the countless creatures in this round of chaos will all be doomed."</p>

  <p>He was right. Since the moment the chaos had come into being, this process had been repeated without exception.</p>

  <p>"What if I can complete the Finale Way?" Zheng asked calmly and confidently.</p>

  <p>This amused the Grandmaster of Heaven greatly and sent him into a burst of laughter.</p>

  <p>Even the members of the Violet Cloud race and other creatures on the Other Shore, burst into laughter from not far off.</p>

  <p>"Complete the Finale Way?"</p>

  <p>"He dares be so cocky? Even those of the Eternal Realm have all failed to complete the Finale Way."</p>

  <p>"Young people like you are always lost in the clouds, dreaming..."</p>

  <p>There were a considerable number of ruling civilizations within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. They all had a great many talents and some of them existed as those who had obtained the luck and resources of the chaos.</p>

  <p>They had put a great deal of effort in and had much more experience than Zheng in completing the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>And yet they had all failed without exception.</p>

  <p>Their disdain for Zheng was understandable when he began speaking so confidently in spite of all they had done. They all believed, without a shadow of a doubt, that he was overestimating himself.</p>

  <p>However, when the members of the Three-eyed race heard Zheng's resolute words, their hearts skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>These ruling civilizations that had once stood by the Finale Way had all been suppressed for too long. The Three Eyes race had not turned to the Nihility race or the Element Spirit race. They just kept to themselves and this left them in the difficult position of having to defend relentlessly against the pincer attacks of the two major races.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, all these civilizations held their faith in the Finale Way, forming alliances with one another as well as the humans in an attempt to thwart the process of the chaos, and help the civilizations in the chaos complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>But since the humans had thinned out, they had been unable to disrupt the forces within the chaos. A long time passed and they had completely given up. The Finale Way became nothing more than an unrealistic hope to them.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's mention of it in public awakened a flicker of their original intent and previous dedication.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was blunt. He had experienced more and knew more than Zheng. He said, "You can't. That probability of pulling it off is infinitely close to zero. You'd do much better to seize the opportunity in front of you."</p>

  <p>"What sort of opportunity is that?"</p>

  <p>As the Grandmaster of Heaven finished speaking, a white ball floated over from afar.</p>

  <p>As it came nearer, a female's voice rang through everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore creatures saw the white ball, their expressions abruptly changed. This new presence floating in was from none other than the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Those that had submitted to the Element Spirit race, such as the Violet Cloud race, appeared respectful, intending to welcome the member of the Element Spirit race graciously.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had established the Blood Assembly in Stage Thirty-two, which was jointly ruled by the famous "big ten". This made those races wonder which of the ten masters was on the way.</p>

  <p>The white ball approached and when they saw the shape of the flame within it, the color from their faces suddenly drained. The Other Shore races dared not get closer to the white ball for a long while.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>By the time the white ball came beside the Grandmaster of Heaven, the flames swirled around it calmly before out of the flames, morphed a perfect body.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be none other than Claire, one of the few members of the Element Spirit race capable of coming into contact with the Eye Spirit. She held a status much higher than the so-called "big ten".</p>

  <p>"Are you on holiday, Grandmaster of Heaven? I can't imagine how else you'd have the time to come to Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore," Claire asked with a cheeky smile.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven glared at her in silence, holding back his aggravation. He said, "It is none of your business and has nothing to do with you."</p>

  <p>"Of course it does,"</p>

  <p>Claire argued, turning her head to smile at Zheng. She looked at him as if he was an exquisite piece of art.</p>

  <p>She twisted her body slightly and came out of the white ball, her flawless face close to Zheng's.</p>

  <p>She was a fire spirit that would melt any substance that got this close to her.</p>

  <p>But by the laws in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, Zheng did not feel the tiniest hint of warmth.</p>

  <p>"I chose this person before you did. I have sacrificed many lives at his hands in order to see him more clearly," Claire said, smiling devilishly. She looked back at the Grandmaster of Heaven and asked, "How could I now let you take him away from me?"</p>

  <p>"You have sacrificed many lives at my hands?" Zheng asked in confusion, frowning intensely. "You mean those..."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Claire replied, nodding dutifully and looking at Zheng with expectation and admiration. "Except for what happened in the Blooming Jade Stage, I arranged all the rest."</p>

  <p>When Elizabeth had led Zheng into the Blooming Jade Stage, they hadn't taken the usually used paths.</p>

  <p>If he had broken into the lower ice field in the Blooming Jade Stage, he would have surely gone through great difficulties before he finally stepped into Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But instead, he passed by the upper ice field and released Pompeo, the bald giant. This caused the Element Spirit race to lose control of the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>"What was the purpose of all this?" Zheng asked, horrified.</p>

  <p>"My purpose is the same as the Grandmaster of Heaven's," She said, grinning. "I had to observe you to determine if you'd be a valuable addition to our Element Spirit race."</p>

  <p>Claire of the Element Spirit race extended an invitation to Zheng as well.</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore creatures present heard the news, they burst into an uproar once again.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had control of almost the entire Other Shore. They hadn't even seen the actual Eternal Realm talents as something special, let alone a talent who had not even entered the Eternal Realm yet.</p>

  <p>Then why did they try to recruit Zheng so openly?</p>

  <p>Who was this human brat? How could two major races fight for him and dispatch their core figures to recruit him? All those present were utterly confused.</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden and the others stood motionlessly not far away.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected things to pan out this way either and were now a little more nervous; they weren't too sure if Zheng would refuse both races.</p>
