  <p>
</p>

  <p>The thin line formed by the blood rotated under the control of Emperor Di Jun. It acted like a red silky ribbon tied on a stick, and Emperor Di Jun took control of that invisible stick. At the same time, dots of light were extracted.</p>

  <p>The light dots moved together and formed into a strange pattern in the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the light dots bewilderedly. He followed their movements with his head and tried to understand it. He asked curiously, "What are these light dots?"</p>

  <p>"The bloodline power," replied Emperor Di Jun as his hands moved in the air, guiding the movement of the dots.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Phoenix were taken aback upon hearing Emperor Di Jun's response. Both of them took a gasp and looked at each other with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>The bloodline power had been hidden in the blood, but both Luo Zheng and Phoenix had never seen anyone ever extract it.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that they had seen the physical bloodline power. As this was something peculiar, Luo Zheng and Phoenix watched avidly.</p>

  <p>After extracting the bloodline power, Emperor Di Jun began to adjust the light spots. He pushed some further and drew some others closer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt as if the light dots were a little familiar. They were very similar to those in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>However, the distance between the light dots in the Abstruse Energy World was significantly large, and there were many of them. That was not like the few in front of him now.</p>

  <p>It took only a short while for Emperor Di Jun to properly adjust the light dots.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The light dots that maintained their positions merged into Phoenix's blood again.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>The blood turned into a thin line which moved in a steady pace and went into Phoenix's wound.</p>

  <p>Her face revealed a painful expression during the process. Her hands were balled into a fist; she clenched her teeth and her eyes were shut closed.</p>

  <p>The bloodline power that had been adjusted by Emperor Di Jun was different from the original one. Thus, it was rejected by the bloodline power in Phoenix's body. Because the two kinds of bloodline repelled each other, there was an unbearable pain for Phoenix to bear.</p>

  <p>With astonishing willpower, Phoenix endured the pain silently.</p>

  <p>The bloodline power refined by Emperor Di Jun was more powerful. It continuously assimilated the remaining blood in Phoenix's body. In just a short span of time, the blood in her body had been completely transformed.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu that had caught her also loosened their huge claws.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a step back as his body's reflex. His expression revealed a look of vigilance and his breaths grew faster and shallower.</p>

  <p>After all, this woman had tried to kill him again and again. It was understandable that he had to guard against her.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. She can't kill you," said Emperor Di Jun, trying to sound reassuring.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"After the transformation, she will only acknowledge allegiance to me," replied Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shot a look at Phoenix upon hearing his response and witnessed how Phoenix's expression became very complicated.</p>

  <p>In her heart, she clearly hated Luo Zheng. She wanted to kill him badly, but it was as if her body did not agree. No matter how hard she tried, her body refused to move.</p>

  <p>It was not because she was spiritually enslaved. Rather, it was her blood that was enslaved by Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>In fact, unbeknownst to some, this kind of enslavement had been existing since the birth of the Jin Wu. The ordinary Jin Wu and the many demon women in the Divine Lair unconditionally trusted and submitted to Emperor Di Jun. This kind of submission was engraved in their blood.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there were only very few betrayers in the Jin Wu. If there were any betrayers, like Feng Ge and Concubine Yan, their blood was not pure.</p>

  <p>Also, they would be detested and hated by their race. This loyalty was part of the bloodline worship.</p>

  <p>It was also in this way that the Ear Mice could control other kinds of mice.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun turned to face Phoenix and spoke in a firm tone, "Luo Zheng is the spokesperson of the 77th civilization. From now on, he is your master."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Phoenix was not convinced. Her body experienced a dissonance. The pair of wings on her back were trembling slightly, but her instinct forced her to lower her head. She gritted her teeth and said, "Yes, Master." She was not in control of her own body, but the annoyance was very much noticeable in her tone.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, she had been doing what she could to try to kill Luo Zheng, but now she was respectful to him. After seeing Phoenix obey the command she was given, although reluctantly, Luo Zheng was surprised. An idea suddenly came to his mind. "Her blood has been transformed. If we inject her blood into other members of the Jin Wu..."</p>

  <p>"You are smart," said Emperor Di Jun with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>This kind of bloodline worship was engraved by instinct, and of course, it was only effective for the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Under the order of Emperor Di Jun, Phoenix reluctantly drew out her blood.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu that had been wrapping Phoenix quickly separated. Phoenix was positioned in the inner layer and was riding a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. After she locked a target, she rushed over to attack.</p>

  <p>In midair not far away, Li Bianxue was stepping on the Lofty Sword with a serious and determined look on her face.</p>

  <p>In front of her stood a burly member of the Jin Wu. He was standing confidently, making him look much bigger than he really was, as if he weren't built big enough.</p>

  <p>His name was Dugan, and he was one of the best royal guards of Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>For Li Bianxue, Dugan was the strongest opponent she had ever faced.</p>

  <p>In the battle with him, she would definitely die if she were not careful enough. Her pretty oval face was full of caution and seriousness. She squinted her eyes and clenched her fists.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be very young," Dugan said confidently as he spread his wings. He raised his right hand, and fire snakes slowly moved around his arm. "It's rare to see such a young talent. Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Before Dugan could finish his words, Li Bianxue tapped the Lofty Sword with her tiptoe. The sword then suddenly turned over, slashing towards Dugan in an immense speed with supreme power.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Li Bianxue ran hurriedly along the blade of the sword.</p>

  <p>She had two short swords in her hands, both of which were extraordinary and sharp.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! There was a tingling in the air as she moved her hands holding the swords.</p>

  <p>As the two short swords flickered, her speed suddenly increased and she disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>The next moment, she appeared on the right side of Dugan. Dugan had surely underestimated Li Bianxue's agility.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword slashed from the left, and Li Bianxue attacked from the right.</p>

  <p>Dugan had no way to escape.</p>

  <p>"Nice try..." Dugan looked at Li Bianxue with a wide smile. "Unfortunately, your strength is too weak."</p>

  <p>He stretched out his wings and moved to dodge the Lofty Sword on the left, pouncing towards Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>There was a flash of surprise in Li Bianxue's bright wide eyes, and she waved her hands in an instant.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Li Bianxue had slashed over a hundred times.</p>

  <p>Because the power of these strikes was not that strong, they were still unable to exhaust Dugan's Chaotic Source Spirits, so he was not hurt at all.</p>

  <p>"I've told you that you don't have enough strength," Dugan said with a mischievous smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue frowned and leaned back. Like a swallow flying backwards, she tried to escape back to the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>But Dugan had already stopped Li Bianxue before she was even able to move.</p>

  <p>He spread his wide wings, and countless fire snakes flew out from them.</p>

  <p>They quickly formed a huge fire net, completely enveloping Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that a talent like you would be killed like this." Dugan licked his lips with excitement on his face. With a gentle pull of his hand, the fire net began to shrink rapidly. His eyes were gleaming and the flames were reflecting on them. He couldn't seem to wipe the smirk off his face.</p>

  <p>Unlike Luo Zheng, Li Bianxue couldn't bear the burning of the flames.</p>

  <p>If the fire net continued to shrink and burn, it would not be difficult to imagine what would happen to her.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue's face turned pale. Just then, a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow flew down and pierced through the fire net to her side.</p>

  <p>She was terribly desperate at the moment. When she saw Luo Zheng rush in, she was utterly stunned. When she came to her senses, she asked, "Why are you here?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't answer her, but instead pointed to the sky. Phoenix, riding another Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, landed beside Dugan.</p>
