<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3932 My Will </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These particular tentacles came from the one that had been cut off by the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline refused to be divided, and even the ones that were divided were very eager to return.</p>

  <p>However, just this one time, the ancestry-level bloodline allowed this individual to stay apart, hide in space, and continue to reproduce on its own.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng broke the light columns one after another, the hidden tentacles gained his experience, and the suckers on their surfaces began adjusting.</p>

  <p>Just when the Grandmaster of Heaven, who had transformed into the Sanskrit Light Body, was close enough to the tentacles, they attempted to swallow him whole in one gulp. They were like a greedy serpent that wanted to devour its prey in one go.</p>

  <p>The suckers of the tentacles aggressively absorbed the Great Sanskrit Light while he was desperately struggling.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven managed to thrust his white sword into many tentacles. The sword pierced so deep that only half of the blade remained exposed.</p>

  <p>However, the lower half of the sword quickly turned black and was completely corroded. In an instant, the sword broke, and the exposed half was sucked into the tentacles.</p>

  <p>On the surface of the Grandmaster of Heaven's body, there were hundreds of visible black dots.</p>

  <p>From there, the power of the foundation was gradually absorbed, and his strength grew weaker and weaker.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, he could still tear the tentacles at will, but as time passed by, he lost his strength to resist against them. His entire body was now wrapped around by the tentacles, and the Great Sanskrit Light contained within his body was being extinguished rapidly.</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven was still showing tenacity and was unwilling to give up. He gathered all his remaining strength and rushed forward in an attempt to break free. When he realized that there was no chance to escape, he desperately stretched out his hand until a finger was exposed outside of the tentacles.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A ray of light shot from his fingertip just before his body was completely devoured by the tentacles.</p>

  <p>Then, the light from the Grandmaster of Heaven's finger condensed in the sky and transformed into his appearance.</p>

  <p>However, the avatar formed was so dim, like the light from a candle that was about to die. His body was almost transparent, and the energy in his body was so weak that it was almost negligible.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't bother to kill the avatar because he knew that he would also disintegrate in no time. So, he just took the opportunity and asked, "Is this the power of the foundation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the avatar replied. He stared at Luo Zheng with a complicated expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>At the back of his mind, he had never thought that he would be defeated. He even used the power of the foundation to its fullest.</p>

  <p>"I see. It's very weak then," Luo Zheng remarked as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven was rendered speechless. He just stood frozen, and he had the expression on his face that wanted to confirm if he heard Luo Zheng's statement correctly.</p>

  <p>Even the real Fuxi and his avatar that was hiding in his body were also shocked. They couldn't help but smirk, thinking that this guy was actually more arrogant than them.</p>

  <p>"What did you just say? You called the power of the foundation weak?!"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven, who had been depressed, was suddenly filled with rage. Consequently, the rate at which his body dissipated also increased.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, did you not hear that clearly? Your power is weak. That's why you're going to die now," Luo Zheng said as he let out a faint smirk.</p>

  <p>"What? Ha-ha! You've got guts, huh?" The Grandmaster of Heaven laughed so hard as if he had heard the funniest joke in his life. "I expect you to go to the Three Purities Stage one day. Let's meet again. I will wait for you there."</p>

  <p>The voice of the Grandmaster of Heaven became softer and softer until it was inaudible. Soon after, his entire body completely vanished.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng stared in the void for a while, he suddenly remembered something when he sensed several intermittent space fluctuations in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Wow, they run so fast," Luo Zheng said as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>After the Grandmaster of Heaven activated his Sanskrit Light Body, not one member of the Black Ship joined the fray.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, the Grandmaster of Heaven and the Black Ship had communicated secretly that they needed to flee as soon as they saw that he was at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>In the battle earlier, the Eternal Realm masters and the Chaos Ancient Gods focused all their attention on the Grandmaster of Heaven. They didn't expect that the Black Ship would use that opportunity to escape.</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship knew that no one pursued them, but they were still in distress.</p>

  <p>Although no one could see the captain's expression, everyone felt his gloomy and miserable aura.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng could actually destroy the Grandmaster of Heaven's Sanskrit Light Body. His strength cannot be underestimated anymore," the captain uttered to himself.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, the captain had only treated Luo Zheng as his junior.</p>

  <p>But in just a short time, Luo Zheng was able to surpass and even kill the person that he looked up to.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was the leader of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he was known for his outstanding strength on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about? That's not even his own power," Shera said, shaking her head as if unwilling to accept the fact that the Grandmaster of Heaven fell in the hands of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Even so, it's a power that he can use. What difference does that make?" the captain answered.</p>

  <p>"The Grandmaster of Heaven must have been too careless. He didn't expect that Luo Zheng would be that strong," said a member of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>The way that Luo Zheng's strange body continuously adapted and evolved was way beyond the imagination of people with ordinary bloodlines. Even for Eternal Realm warriors, that kind of strength was unconventional.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>As most of the members of the Black Ship were feeling depressed, the Evil God burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>Shera quickly turned around and gave him a sharp gaze. "What are you laughing at?"</p>

  <p>Then, the corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up. "It's so simple. The Grandmaster of Heaven is weaker than Luo Zheng. Why are you still justifying him? It's ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God finished speaking, he suddenly felt a fist smashing on his face.</p>

  <p>The Evil God instantly flew and crashed on the deck of the Black Ship. A huge hole was created where he landed.</p>

  <p>It was the brass man who punched him. His fist remained clenched, and the cold look in his eyes could turn water into ice.</p>

  <p>Actually, if he didn't make the move, other people on the Black Ship would have taken the initiative. The look in their eyes was clearly screaming that no one could speak ill of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Evil God slowly crawled out of the hole, still wearing a smug look on his face. "What? Did I say something wrong? Ha-ha! Why would you even defend the reputation of someone who failed because of his weakness?" He wasn't apologetic at all.</p>

  <p>As the brass man heard his impious laughter, his rage started contorting his face.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>His heavy body ran wildly on the deck and rushed towards the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Holes and cracks were appearing as he passed by the deck.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's laughter became more intense just before the brass man approached him.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Black Ship were also hopeful that the brass man would shut the Evil God's mouth, and teach him a lesson. However, their hearts began throbbing when the Evil God shouted, "Kneel!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A strong will instantly descended from above.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just any ordinary will. Its power was beyond words.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>Under the excessive pressure of the surging will, the aggressive brass man froze and knelt before the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Evil God! Do you have a death wish?"</p>

  <p>"Dare to make one false move, and we'll be sure that you regret it!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the members of the Black Ship saw that the brass man was being utterly humiliated, they started yelling with angry faces. With just a single order from their captain, they were ready to take the Evil God down.</p>

  <p>However, the captain stayed silent and looked up.</p>

  <p>From where he stood, he could see the enormous outer wall of the Source World above them, from where the tremendous will had just come.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, is that the will of the Source World?" the captain asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"No," the Evil God replied with a confident sneer. "It's my will."</p>
