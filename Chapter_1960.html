<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since the Sacred race invaded the universe, they had been much like a hot knife slicing through butter.</p>

  <p>Not only did the race continue displaying their own invincible strength, it also promoted the Sacred race's noble bloodline.</p>

  <p>Every time Maha killed a world lord, he used a Roaring Token to give the announcement of his victim to the entire universe. Constantly, he would spread the news that the Sacred race had inherited the most perfect race within the divine land— all races were inferior to them.</p>

  <p>They were indeed strong enough to do so. With this sort of propaganda, many martial artists were under the illusion that the high and mighty Sacred race was invincible. Compared to their perfect race, the human race was lowly.</p>

  <p>In this situation, many human martial artists were struck with fear before the Sacred race. This feeling spread in the hearts of the human warriors, crushing their morale.</p>

  <p>Zheng's current methods were rather simple. The Sacred race of the Murphy Universe wasn't from the real Sacred race, but even if these people were truly inherited from the perfect race of the divine land, he would still make up stories to belittle them.</p>

  <p>Because first of all, he had to lower the enemy's morale— only then would he be able to save the humans' morale.</p>

  <p>Now that the Roaring Token had been activated, his voice spread throughout the entire universe. Countless creatures began listening attentively.</p>

  <p>Originally, there weren't many rules in a battle between two races.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was the strongest Godly Genius of the human race, was quarreling with his counterpart in the Sacred race, Maha. There was no need for any sort of rules. So he slandered the Sacred race, turning white into black and then white…The lies went on. And Zheng showed no hesitation in using such tricks.</p>

  <p>His opponent, Maha, was undoubtedly arrogant and ruthless, his style vicious and his actions decisive. But as a Godly Genius, he was used to fighting and killing his enemies. How could he argue like this? Maha had little experience in quibbling. When faced with such a situation, he was momentarily at a loss and had no clue how to respond properly.</p>

  <p>"You…you…you… Nonsense!" Such was Maha's only retort.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his counterattack was weak as he stammered, lacking his usual confidence in battle.</p>

  <p>Hearing Maha's voice, many of the warriors of the Sacred race in the Evolutionary Universe couldn't help but shake their heads. Maha had extraordinary talent and formidable strength, but his quarreling skills were all too lacking.</p>

  <p>His retort was merely a flick. Not only did it lack any strength, it made clear his flaws.</p>

  <p>And how could Zheng let go of such flaws?</p>

  <p>"I know you're feeling guilty. The trouble with the Murphy Universe has yet to be solved. Your false Sacred race is in danger of being eliminated as well. The Celestial Ghost race has gathered five True Gods and a thousand Supreme Lords— they will definitely destroy everything. You can only fight hard and hope to seize our Evolutionary Universe like a dog that has been disowned." Zheng's grip on the Roaring Token grew tighter as his words grew louder and more fluent. The golden light in his eyes turned more intense as his righteous aura grew more and more majestic.</p>

  <p>But what he said was nonsense.</p>

  <p>He had fabricated the point about the Celestial Ghost race. And as for a thousand Supreme Lords, it was impossible for a single universe to have so many.</p>

  <p>But how could an ordinary warrior know anything about this?</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice projected confidence. Even the warriors of the Sacred race couldn't help but wonder whether he was telling the truth.</p>

  <p>"You barbarians fail to walk the right path. Instead, you take the opportunity to invade the Evolutionary Universe. You've destroyed everything in your path. You've caused great suffering and calamity, unforgivably so! I,  Zheng Luo, have received great fortune from the heavens. As a Godly Genius, I shall lead the human race and drive you out of the universe. Warriors, no matter how strong or weak, grab your weapons and follow me into this fight…"</p>

  <p>Zheng's speech was decisive.</p>

  <p>This was certainly his declaration of war.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Sacred race attacked the universe without so much as a declaration. The Celestial Position race had adopted a policy of appeasement and for a time, they avoided a fight against the Sacred race, even sacrificing thousands of supreme worlds of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>In the midst of her wrath, Supreme Lord of Oracle had chosen to confront the Sacred race head-on. But after suffering a crushing defeat, she returned. The whole thing had severely damaged the human race's morale.</p>

  <p>But they couldn't blame the Celestial Position race and the old leader.</p>

  <p>After all, the Celestial Position race existed only to wait for the growth of the Godly Geniuses. Such was also Mike's plan. But it was flawed and the Sacred race attacked the universe sooner than anticipated.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had finally returned, it was time for him to declare war on behalf of the human race.</p>

  <p>As the words of declaration escaped his mouth, heroic spirit filled the skies and stirred up the pride in the hearts of the countless beings in the universe. The fear they held for the Sacred race vanished like smoke in thin air.</p>

  <p>"Good! Zheng is indeed the top Godly Genius."</p>

  <p>"As a member of the universe, we will fight till the last drop of blood!"</p>

  <p>"We may be mortals, but we're not afraid of fate. The Sacred race is a barbaric one.</p>

  <p>They may be strong, but they won't bring me to my knees."</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, warriors of all races and classes, and all sorts of intelligent life forms hidden in underground caves or high up in the starry sky were all boiling with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, someone burst out in laughter.</p>

  <p>This voice belonged to Mathias, an ogre Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you're a good one. In the past, we ogres wanted to do away with you! I never expected us to join hands against our enemies! The barbarians are nothing to talk about. I'll wipe out all these rebellions of the Demon Night race and meet you again!"</p>

  <p>Just as Supreme Lord Mathias finished speaking, another voice was heard— it was the voice of Master Feng, the old leader of the Celestial Position race. "Our Celestial Position race is under the secret orders of the universe's master. We will support Zheng in fighting the barbarians.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng has returned, it is time to declare war!"</p>

  <p>"We, the Xuanyuan Clan, are following the disciple of the master of this universe..."</p>

  <p>"We, the Blessed Buddha Land..."</p>

  <p>"We, the Humanity Alliance..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's declaration of war was like a spark thrown into a fire, igniting the entire universe. Several great human powers roared simultaneously as they began declaring war on the Sacred race with the Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in a remote supreme world of the Humanity Alliance, the corpses of the warriors of the Sacred race had already piled up like a mountain. When these people were still alive, they had all been martial artists at the Soul Sea Realm, Spirit Supreme Realm, or Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>Among them, there were 326 warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, 67 warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm, and 14 warriors at the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>A human girl stood at the peak of this corpse-riddled mountain.</p>

  <p>Her long, nine-colored skirt seemed to dance in the wind. Under her long black hair, her right cheek was badly mutilated and one of her eyeballs had exploded. It was a tragic sight. But from the left side of her face, still in good condition, one could still see her beauty.</p>

  <p>In front of the young girl stood two world lords of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>These men were also heavily injured. They floated in the air, gasping for breath as they kept vigilant in the face of the human girl before them.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Maha's argument spreading by the Roaring Tokens suspended the battle between the two sides.</p>

  <p>The young girl's gaze never landed on the world lords— at this moment, her eyes were on the sky.</p>

  <p>Her only remaining eye flickered.</p>

  <p>The moment she heard Zheng's voice, the trace of sadness in her eye disappeared and was replaced with joy and gratification.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" The large eye on the girl's face suddenly curved into a crescent moon as she smiled at the world lords.</p>

  <p>They were stunned. Being fooled by Zheng in such a manner was a huge blow to their ego.</p>

  <p>"What nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"Kill this woman!"</p>

  <p>The two world lords were growing more irritated and frustrated.</p>

  <p>The woman's methods were all too terrifying— she had completely annihilated an army of the Sacred race right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>More hateful was that she had come and gone without a trace. She even managed to escape unscathed as she was chased down by a Supreme Lord of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"You should have listened." The woman's voice was clear, but it was laced with ice-cold killing intent, void of any emotion.</p>

  <p>Watching the world lords rush over, she stepped on her wooden clogs and leaped backward, maintaining a posture of free landing.</p>

  <p>Her severely injured right cheek began recovering rapidly— the wounds in her face shifted and her eyeball was restored to its natural position. In an instant, her beauty was restored.</p>

  <p>Nine varying streaks of light burst from behind her, forming ribbons that resembled phoenix feathers as they flew towards the two world lords.</p>

  <p>"Listen carefully— Zheng is humankind's greatest pride!"</p>

  <p>And these were the last words the world lords heard from the girl before they fell to their deaths.</p>
