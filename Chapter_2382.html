<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2382 Who Spared The Other's Life </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng's original intentions were to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain after traveling through the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Despite his plans, after these encounters, he was left with no other option but to threaten the consummate True Gods' lives. Unexpectedly, the Holy Beings didn't seem to mind them in the least.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng almost lost out to them.</p>

  <p>Of course, the lives of the consummate True Gods were of little value to the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Joy swallowed the pill in a single gulp, tilting her head back with force.</p>

  <p>A trace of purple aura, like a slithering snake, circled her body rhythmically before finally penetrating the wounds in her waist.</p>

  <p>As Joy took the time to heal herself, her pretty eyes fell on the small black snake in Zheng's hand. It wasn't before long that she noticed that Zheng's expression gradually became unfriendly. "Let them go right after I recover from my injury. We will leave here immediately afterward," she said faintly.</p>

  <p>"Why would I let them go?" Zheng asked, frowning slightly.</p>

  <p>A few of the consummate True Gods within the jade seal might have been innocent, but most of them had a grudge against Zheng and even wanted to kill him. Notably warriors like Rachelle and Walton.</p>

  <p>Though Troy had stopped Rachelle from killing him in the forbidden land, he didn't do it to help Zheng. He just wanted to hand Zheng off to Nicholas, who would dispose of him properly.</p>

  <p>It was only normal that he didn't want to let the consummate True Gods go that easily.</p>

  <p>"If you really do kill these consummate True Gods, the Holy Beings will never let you go," added Joy, in a matter of fact tone.</p>

  <p>"Joy, do you really think the Holy Beings will let me go if I don't kill the consummate True Gods?" Zheng's gaze and expression were completely frozen as he asked this question.</p>

  <p>With her beautiful eyes coldly fixed on Zheng, Joy said with a smile, "You are Mike's son, but you're nothing more than a low-rank True God after all. You're not powerful enough to cause a group of Holy Beings to hunt you down. But, if you kill the consummate True Gods, that'll be a different story..."</p>

  <p>As he listened to Joy speak, Zheng fell into deep thought.</p>

  <p>Joy was right.</p>

  <p>In those Holy Beings' eyes, like Nicholas', Zheng was just a speck of dust in the air. He wasn't even highly qualified enough to make them become serious.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas knew that Zheng was Mike's son, he was still willing to accept him as a disciple. Perhaps he had another motive, but one way or another, it demonstrated that Zheng's identity really had very little importance.</p>

  <p>"If you can help your father fulfill his wishes and revive the Luo Clan in the future, then these consummate True Gods will become nothing more than ants in your eyes, too. More so, taking their lives will be a piece of cake for you," mentioned Joy.</p>

  <p>Still paying attention to her words, Zheng only nodded silently.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of his hand, a five-colored halo appeared and slowly spread outward, forming a path of time.</p>

  <p>Once it was formed, Zheng stepped into it.</p>

  <p>Outside the Heavenly Wheel Temple, the expressions of Rachelle, Walton, Shahn and the other consummate True Gods didn't look too good, but were dim and dull.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate here was much faster than that found throughout the divine land.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had left, a total of two and a half days had passed in the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Rachelle and the others continued to explore the Heavenly Wheel Temple, but didn't find anything valuable. In the end, they were out of options and could only return to the Heavenly Wheel Temple's entrance from the underground cave.</p>

  <p>Once the light curtain outside the Heavenly Wheel Temple was activated, they were surprised to see so many Spears of Time still standing erect on the light curtain. How were they ever going to escape from such a situation?</p>

  <p>Just outside the light curtain, Troy, Alfredo and the other consummate True Gods were arriving one by one.</p>

  <p>After exploring the area for a short period of time, the consummate True Gods finally fell upon the Heavenly Wheel Temple as well.</p>

  <p>Although they were on the outside of the light curtain, they too, were completely unable to leave this place. The reason was simple— they couldn't figure their way out.</p>

  <p>"What the hell should we do now?" asked Rachelle, staring at Troy through a thin layer of light curtain.</p>

  <p>"What else can we do? At this point, we may as well get some rest and go to sleep!" Walton responded, lying on the ground. He was inexplicably in a good mood.</p>

  <p>Troy frowned and stared back at Rachelle as he asked, "How did that guy even remove the jade seal when you have so many consummate True Gods with you?"</p>

  <p>Rachelle let out a snort, and snapped, "You have quite the nerve to say something like that! If it weren't for you, I'd have killed that guy back in the valley long ago, and he couldn't have had such an opportunity."</p>

  <p>As Troy heard this, his face took on a ghastly expression.</p>

  <p>Things were completely out of their control. How could he have expected such a situation when he was the one who stopped her?</p>

  <p>"Well, it definitely isn't the time to blame each other," said Shahn, shaking his head. "Even if he has gotten the jade seal, he still can't escape. Ultimately, he'll have to leave the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Do you think actually the Holy Beings would let him go?"</p>

  <p>Walton propped his head up with one hand languidly and agreed, "You're right! He is an outsider of the Han Clan's Floating Island. Samuel isn't bold enough to protect him. No way! All that to say, it's better if we just rest!"</p>

  <p>However, Alfredo, who wasn't far away, said nothing as he heard them speak.</p>

  <p>"If I ever get another chance, trust me, I'll tear him to shreds!" In Rachelle's eyes could be seen a surging, murderous intent. She bit her lip hard until it turned white, and she fixed her eyes fiercely on the man lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>The insane murderous intent radiating from Rachelle made Walton feel uncomfortable. He shouted, "Can you stop glaring at me like that? I'm not the one who prevented you from leaving..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice interrupted Walton before he could even finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>"If I give you the chance, can you really tear me to shreds?"</p>

  <p>As the consummate True Gods heard this voice ring out, their faces turned gloomy and the hearts fell heavy.</p>

  <p>Panic was written all over Alfredo's face. Without a second's hesitation, he retreated backward rapidly.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng could control these black spears with skill. He could only imagine how unpleasant it would be to be shot at by one of these spears, especially at such a short distance.</p>

  <p>That said, the other consummate True Gods weren't aware of Zheng's ability.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A thin, swishing sound was heard as the sand flowed onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The sand gathered at once and quickly formed a person's figure. A few brief instants later, the sand had transformed into a sculpture identical to Zheng. It looked lifelike.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was infuriated by Zheng. When she noticed the faint tinge of ridicule on the sand sculpture's face, her blood began to boil as she grew even more infuriated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>She immediately hacked at it with her machete, throwing it with all her might directly at the sculpture.</p>

  <p>What ensued were numerous more violent strikes.</p>

  <p>When Rachelle finally put her machete away, a thin outline of cuts appeared on the surface of the sand sculpture, before it collapsed with a loud crash.</p>

  <p>"Having any fun?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice rang out again.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, another five sand sculptures formed, all identical to Zheng. All five sculptures gathered beside Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Rachelle wasn't tolerating the provocation whatsoever. She began swinging her machete anew.</p>

  <p>As soon as she crushed these sand sculptures though, more and more sand sculptures rose to life. The sand in the desert was endless. How could she destroy them all if they kept coming?</p>

  <p>Rachelle couldn't stop herself from shouting, "If you have the ability, show your real body! Why the hell are you sneaking around like a coward?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng quietly appeared behind the light curtain, hovering in midair leisurely.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to fly in this world! How did he manage such a feat?</p>

  <p>The only person who had actually seen Zheng flying was Alfredo, but he didn't provide this clue to the other consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>As a result, the consummate True Gods' expressions changed greatly as they took notice of the scene, too.</p>

  <p>Troy's face darkened. The sand had naturally gathered and formed. Now that Zheng was floating in thin air, everyone knew he had a very high control over this world. It was safe to say that Zheng could rule everyone's life and death in this space.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>With a sudden slash from her machete, Rachelle snapped, "Hand over the jade seal and I'll spare your life!"</p>

  <p>She was impetuous and enjoyed killing, but she didn't think before acting as much as Troy did.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his hand gently. The dense black spears on the light curtain were like beady snake heads that were raised slowly. They aimed at the great group of consummate True Gods, including Rachelle. The corners of Zheng's mouth curled into a smile, and he said, "I wonder who's going to spare the other's life now?"</p>
