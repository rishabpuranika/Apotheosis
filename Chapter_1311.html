<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Some bystanders couldn't help but sigh when they saw the two newcomers surrounded by Ernest and his men. It was an unlucky day for them since not only would they lose all their life vitality crystals, the woman was also surely going to be humiliated by this group of bullies.</p>

  <p>They earnestly watched the scene from a distance. Most of them had also experienced being blackmailed by Ernest before and had no desire to undergo such an experience ever again. They could only sympathize and hope these newcomers wouldn't be hurt too much.</p>

  <p>To their utmost surprise, instead of being bullied, the Life and Death Realm kid suddenly punched Ernest and sent him flying through the air.</p>

  <p>They all couldn't help but flinch when they heard an ominous crack once his body fell into the cave.</p>

  <p>This show of monstrous strength immediately changed the bystanders' perception of Zheng. No longer could they see him as a random Life and Death Realm kid. He was a devil that must be feared. Realizing that a bigger fish had arrived, they all quickly scattered and flew far away from that place.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but shake his head at the others' reaction. He turned to Freya and gave her a smile. "Let's go back and hand over these life vitality jades," he said, before quickly flying away towards the gathering place.</p>

  <p>Freya quickly followed behind him. Their journey was quiet but her gaze spoke volumes at how much she regarded Zheng with a new light.</p>

  <p>She had first thought of herself as stronger owing to her higher cultivation along with the fact that her uncle was also the lord of a big city in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Freya was not lacking in both physical and social power. She had initially planned to do Zheng a favor by recommending him to her uncle to help the young Life and Death Realm warrior reach his full potential under his tutelage.</p>

  <p>However, seeing just what Zheng was capable of, Freya now thought it stupid to think that he needed her or anyone's help. It was, in fact, the opposite: she was the one who needed his help.</p>

  <p>This was a big blow to her pride but she couldn't help but also feel extremely grateful since he did get her out of the earlier altercation.</p>

  <p>The two of them shortly arrived in the gathering place. Warriors were continually milling about the place. There were those that arrived to hand over their life vitality crystals. Others would rest for a bit while most went straight back to mining in order to gather one million supreme life vitality crystals so they could leave this damned place as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Zheng took out the life vitality jades and all the warriors present couldn't help but feel extremely envious at his haul.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate for these jealous warriors because numerous Spiritual Force Sacred Place warriors guarded the gathering place, making robbery an impossibility.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Aren't you that warrior who just registered here not long ago?" the armored man in charge of collecting the life vitality crystals remarked, looking Zheng up and down as he tried to size up the youth.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because life vitality jades were rare. There were plenty of warriors out there willing to risk their lives by entering the bottom of the mineral vein to dig for these things. However, Zheng was a newly registered warrior but he already had so many life vitality jades with him which was a valid cause for surprise.</p>

  <p>"And what of it?" Zheng asked indifferently. "Is there a problem?"</p>

  <p>The armored man chuckled. "Of course not!" he said. "It's actually great that you managed to obtain so many! The sooner you finish the task, the earlier you can leave! And that's a good thing for you."</p>

  <p>The life vitality jades were equally divided and registered under both his and Freya's names. Despite Freya not really playing a major part in getting their precious haul, Zheng was still a fair man and chose not to be greedy over something that he knew he could work to get. He did not hope that Freya would bring any benefit to himself, nor was he attracted by her beautiful appearance, He was someone who believed that as long as someone had the strength, then nice things would come sooner or later.</p>

  <p>After handing the life vitality jades over, Zheng did not go back to mining right away. Although he was unable to leave the mineral vein, he was still relatively free to walk around the place, and he had something more important to do right now.</p>

  <p>A vast open field laid just outside the gathering place wherein a lot of warriors sat in meditation.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Freya agreed to meet in the gathering place at noon tomorrow to explore the mineral vein together again.</p>

  <p>Freya had wanted to follow Zheng but felt that he wanted to do his errands alone. She found a corner for herself instead and started cultivating.</p>

  <p>Zheng hung out in the field for a while before going back to the mineral vein. He soon found a small cave and entered. Once he was deep enough, he decided to smash the walls to form a small hollow big enough for him. Taking out his sword, Zheng set out and carved a small bed in his manmade hollow cave. He also set up a divine texture at the entrance of the cave to conceal his scent. Satisfied that he hid himself pretty well, Zheng went back to his makeshift bed and took out the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had already expressed the importance of this token to Zheng. It wasn't something that could easily be obtained by anyone. In fact, a world lord of a supreme world only had two at most. The one Zheng had in his hand could be used for unlimited times, and thus was invaluable.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew he had to be extremely careful in using this invaluable trinket.</p>

  <p>Knowing that he had done the necessary preparations, Zheng had taken out this Roaring Token and prepared to activate it.</p>

  <p>According to Immortal Book, this was activated with life vitality which Zheng no longer had. However, he had chaotic energy which was way stronger. It was this chaotic energy that he poured into the Roaring Token which soon began to emit a faint, golden light.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed once he saw it glow. "It's done," he said. He then held out his hands and readied his voice, "Yan Luo! Where are you?!"</p>

  <p>He shouted these words into the Roaring Token that then got to work in spreading his voice far and wide across the supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>"Yan Luo! Where are you…?!" his words rang loud and clear in the Spirit Reading World!</p>

  <p>But it didn't stop there.</p>

  <p>The Autumn Mountain World, the Myriad Ogres World, the Divine Might World, the Lofty Emperor World, the Cloud Light World…</p>

  <p>A hundred thousand supreme worlds heard his voice all at the same time.</p>

  <p>All the people who lived in these worlds heard the call.</p>

  <p>"Yan Luo! Where are you…?"</p>

  <p>Even Freya, who was in the middle of cultivating, heard it.</p>

  <p>Her eyes snapped open at the voice.</p>

  <p>It felt somewhat familiar. In fact, the voice sounded like… Zheng's?</p>

  <p>But that couldn't be possible. Zheng was nowhere near her at the moment.</p>

  <p>The next moment, she realized that it was the sound spreading throughout the entire universe by the Roaring Token!</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened at a sudden realization, "No… it couldn't be," she murmured to herself.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the voice she heard was just similar to Zheng's. There was no way that youth was in possession of a Roaring Token!</p>

  <p>A Roaring Token's value was incalculable and even the world lord of the Spirit Reading World only had one in his possession. Zheng was someone who had only recently ascended to the Upper World and there was no way he would subject himself to mining here if he had something as precious as a Roaring Token. The price of just one of those things would be enough to free all the warriors in this mineral vein.</p>

  <p>Freya tried to convince herself that it couldn't be Zheng but she couldn't shake the fact that the voice she heard was just too familiar.</p>

  <p>Yan Luo - that was the name the voice had uttered earlier. The surname was Luo and the given name was Yan. Yan Luo and  Zheng Luo… No matter how she looked at it, the two names were unmistakably related!</p>

  <p>'No, maybe it's just a coincidence, ' she thought to herself. Zheng might have surprised her with his strength but there was no way someone like him was in possession of such a valuable thing as a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her. A lot of creatures who gained wisdom all across the universe were also puzzled by this voice.</p>

  <p>It seemed the voice uttered the name of a person he was looking for, however, this Yan Luo seemed to be someone obscure. Was it really necessary to have used a Roaring Token just to find someone?</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's a descendant of some Supreme Lord. He might have a lot of Roaring Tokens on hand so he didn't bother wasting it!"</p>

  <p>"This is really burning money! My God, a Roaring Token... Isn't it too wasteful to use it like this?!"</p>

  <p>"Well, this wouldn't be the first time. The eldest son of Supreme Lord Dafydd once used a hundred Roaring Tokens to express his love for Supreme Lord Darryl's daughter back in the day. Rich people can be really wasteful sometimes."</p>

  <p>Back in the small cave, Zheng continued to wait.</p>

  <p>According to Xun, the young man that had taken Yan was even stronger than a Supreme Lord so Zheng assumed that he should have a Roaring Token. And the young man had promised Zheng that Yan would be safe with him. If Yan heard him then she would also definitely reply.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng waited for a long while but did not get any response. His gaze gradually darkened There were only two reasons he could think of which would explain this situation: one, Yan had been unable to obtain a Roaring Token and couldn't answer, or two, she was not within the range of this universe.</p>

  <p>The first reason would entail that Yan's situation wasn't as good as Zheng had initially thought. She could be imprisoned or worse. Maybe the young man was mean and refused to give her a Roaring Token to reply to her brother.</p>
