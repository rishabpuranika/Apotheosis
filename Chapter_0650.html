<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Zheng just rolled his eyes when he saw that the guards got worked up over the divine texture.</p>

  <p>Just then, a voice seemed to speak in his mind. It was the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>"Just tell them that you encountered a Taoist priest called Josh in the Lower World and he gave you the divine texture," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded then told the guards what the cyan dragon said to him.</p>

  <p>The guards cast each other serious glances upon hearing Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, one guard nodded at Luo Zheng and opened the iron fence's door for him, and released him from the prison.</p>

  <p>The stowaways from the Lower World looked at each other in amazement when they saw that Luo Zheng was released.</p>

  <p>'What did the nature creature do? Why did they let him go?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>"You stay here. I'll report this matter to the lord of the city," the guard told Luo Zheng. After that, he rushed outside with the divine texture.</p>

  <p>"Cyan dragon, what message did you leave on the divine texture?" Luo Zheng asked. A sly smile crossed the cyan dragon's lips again.</p>

  <p>"I just left a breath of my soul on it. The guard didn't recognize it, but he knew the dragon mark I left," he explained.</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon continued to tell Luo Zheng more about the place. The city they were in was not the main city of the Genuine Dragon World. It was built as a place where the Dragon Lineage Human elites could cultivate.</p>

  <p>Even the members of Dragon Lineage Human who had ascended to the Upper World must pass the trial before they could enter the Genuine Dragon World. It was so that the Genuine Dragons made sure that those selected were geniuses of their race. On the other hand, the message the cyan dragon left on the divine texture was a request for Luo Zheng. He asked the lord of the city to give Luo Zheng a chance to train here.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew this, and nodded in affirmation. If Luo Zheng wanted to embark on the top level of martial arts in his life as a martial artist, he must cultivate himself hard. Although the cyan dragon had helped him a lot, Luo Zheng couldn't rely on him all the time.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had saved him from a thousand years in prison, which was indeed a great act of kindness he would never forget. Now, the training in the Upper World that he asked for Luo Zheng was also another blessing. If Luo Zheng could take the trial, he would gain many benefits.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have returned to your hometown, why don't you reveal yourself to them?" Luo Zheng asked curiously. The mysterious furnace, the black flame, the cyan dragon, and the eight other dragons in it were all a huge mystery to Luo Zheng--and that mystery had led him to where he was now.</p>

  <p>When the cyan dragon heard Zheng's question, he got silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Even if I come back, so what? Something that cannot be changed, still cannot be changed," he said with a heavy sigh. There was a hint of sadness in the cyan dragon's voice when he said those words.</p>

  <p>It made Luo Zheng feel sad as well. The cyan dragon had been on his mind for a long time and Luo Zheng thought highly of him. He had seen many great things.</p>

  <p>It was no doubt that nothing that happened in the Lower World was even enough to surprise him.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that he also had a high position in the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>However, the sigh he just let out brought Luo Zheng a feeling of familiarity. It reminded him of the days when he suffered humiliation in the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, the cyan dragon also had an unspeakable past.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't get to the bottom of it. He knew that with his current strength, he was still weak in the Lower World, let alone in the city of the Upper World, which lay on the outskirts of the Genuine Dragon World. He was just like a small speck of dust and couldn't offer any help to the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Though he didn't have the ability, he did have the determination.</p>

  <p>After quite some time, the guard finally came back. He nodded calmly at Luo Zheng and threw him a token. "I have informed the lord, and he allowed you to train with the other cultivators. Come with me," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave him a knowing nod. He had no doubt about the cyan dragon's capabilities, and he believed the city lord would even come to meet him in person if the cyan dragon asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took the token and followed the guard out of the prison, while the envious eyes of the other stowaways in the cell stared at him.</p>

  <p>The guard led him through half of the city. What impressed Luo Zheng the most was the vast size of it. They rode a half-man, half-bird monster on the way, but it still took them a long time to get to their destination, which was another square of the city.</p>

  <p>The building there was huge, but not exquisite. After they landed at the square, two old men approached them. Luo Zheng couldn't gauge their cultivation bases. Maybe they had covered them up with a secret technique, or they had extremely high cultivation bases and Luo Zheng simply couldn't see them at all.</p>

  <p>"Who is he? He is not a Dragon Lineage Human, but just an ordinary human. Why was he sent here?" one old man asked when he saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No, there seems to be a trace of flood dragon force in his body. He might have absorbed the blood of the flood dragon. But even then, he still could not be regarded as a Dragon Lineage Human," another old man added with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>Just then, the guard who had brought Luo Zheng to this place spoke up,"The lord has granted him a token, and said that this person was specially approved to participate in the training."</p>

  <p>"Is this an order from the lord?"</p>

  <p>There was a look of surprise on the old man's face. He took a closer look at Luo Zheng and wondered what kind of relationship there was between he and the city lord. He could not figure out how the lord had anything to do with this guy, who was merely a nature creature.</p>

  <p>He thought that since the lord didn't show up, they had an ordinary relationship. He felt relieved when he thought about it.</p>

  <p>"In that case, come with me. I'll let you get the blood of the genuine dragon first. Then, I will take you to participate in the training," the old man said.</p>

  <p>"The blood of the genuine dragon?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned. He did not expect to get the blood of the genuine dragon just by participating in the training.</p>

  <p>"Every Dragon Lineage Human that has ascended to the Upper World can receive a drop of genuine dragon blood to increase the concentration of blood in their bodies. Although you are an outsider, you can also receive a drop of genuine dragon blood according to the usual practice, since the lord has approved," the old man said with a nod.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Lineage Human was the human being who had inherited the Dragon Lineage. The blood concentration in the Dragon Lineage Humans varied. Some people had a low blood concentration in their bodies, while others had a high blood concentration. For instance, Tracy's body had a medium concentration of Blue Phoenix's blood.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how high or low it was, they would be given a drop of genuine dragon blood.</p>

  <p>"Give me the token. I will use it to get the blood of the genuine dragon," said the old man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng handed over the token, as he told the cyan dragon in his mind,"Your dragon family is really generous."</p>

  <p>"Hey, we're genuine dragons. An adult genuine dragon is thousands of miles long. Its blood can drown out the entire Central Region. So one or two drops of blood of genuine dragon isn't really much," he said confidently. The cyan dragon seemed to have fun poking at Zheng's ignorance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clicked his tongue in admiration. This super legendary beast's power was really beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," the old man told Luo Zheng. After the old man took Luo Zheng across the square, they arrived in front of a purple hall. He asked Luo Zheng to wait outside before he went inside the purple hall.</p>

  <p>After a while, the old man came out. He threw the token along with a small jade bottle towards Luo Zheng. "There are several rooms for cultivating over there. You may choose one to absorb this drop of genuine dragon blood. Come to me after you have absorbed it. And then you can participate in the training," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held the bottle in his hand and felt as if there was a living thing that wanted to escape inside it.</p>

  <p>Following what the old man had said, Luo Zheng randomly picked out a training chamber. He closed the door and sat down on his knees above a futon, then carefully opened the small bottle.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>An oval drop of blood jumped out of the little bottle and floated in front of him.</p>

  <p>Although it was only a drop of a genuine dragon's blood, Luo Zheng could feel its indescribable power.</p>

  <p>"If you keep watching, you might as well let me swallow it up," the cyan dragon said in jest.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng knew he was just joking. He played along and said with a pout,"There is only one drop. Let you swallow it up? No way."</p>

  <p>After that, he stretched two fingers, which sent out a plume of life vitality. It quickly wrapped around the drop of blood, and went into his mouth.</p>

  <p>The blood of flood dragon that he had immersed his body in when he was on the Cloud Road was very thick. Even if it was splashed outside, it would automatically coagulate into one body. Luo Zheng had thought that blood was amazing before he saw how unbelievable the blood of genuine dragon was. This drop of blood from a genuine dragon seemed to be spiritual. It was trying to break free from Zheng's life vitality.</p>

  <p>However, the power of merely one drop of blood was still too weak, and ultimately it couldn't escape its fate of being swallowed up by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had swallowed down the blood, he felt that the blood in his whole body seemed to boil gradually. Then, the drop of dragon blood quickly spread throughout his body and blended with his own blood.</p>
