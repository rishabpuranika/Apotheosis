<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just transferred the Profound Holy Thunder, and it nearly destroyed one-third of the Celestial Wolf World's area, and the entire Sacred race within it.</p>

  <p>The Profound Holy Thunder shone like mercury as it trickled down Zheng's body while he gradually transferred it to the Celestial Wolf World.</p>

  <p>Above his head, the thunder vortex disappeared as if it was never there.</p>

  <p>However, the lightning snakes came together into a giant ball of lightning and wrapped themselves around Luo Zheng. The ball lost energy eventually, with the light dimming as it shrank.</p>

  <p>Everything took place in at least a minute and a half.</p>

  <p>Once the light rays disappeared, a massive crater developed beneath Yao's feet. It was wide and deep, impossible to fill up. Perhaps it was bottomless.</p>

  <p>"It's over..."</p>

  <p>Yao slowly walked over and stood at the edge of the crater, looking down. Her eyes turned a dark brown in dismay.</p>

  <p>"This fellow..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, sat still, cross-legged with his eyes closed. Not a single speck of dust on his body, including the long robe that fell behind him.</p>

  <p>Before this, Yao had already felt a trace of worry.</p>

  <p>It was of common knowledge that the Godly Geniuses had a mission— everyone knew this. They had been born in the universe with the responsibility of saving it someday. Because of their power, they could not be easily killed.</p>

  <p>The first thing Yao did after Ying sealed Luo Zheng with the Willow of Destruction, was to summon the Profound Holy Thunder.</p>

  <p>This specific thunder was one of Yao's top theurgies.</p>

  <p>Despite this, Luo Zheng remained unharmed. She suddenly realized that this made things a lot more complicated.</p>

  <p>Seeing Yao, Ying shook her head in confusion. Just then, her body flashed, and she ended up above the giant hole. Her eyes scoped the situation, and she furrowed her eyebrows in surprise. "He's not dead?</p>

  <p>Even his clothes weren't damaged? What kind of robe is this?"</p>

  <p>Korbin and Leroy were both shocked to hear this.</p>

  <p>Most especially Leroy, whose dull eyes gave off hopeful expressions.</p>

  <p>He had thought he was doomed. The two Blood-devouring Bone Arrows did not achieve anything, burning two-thirds of his life for nothing.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was bound and baptized by the Profound Holy Thunder.</p>

  <p>The odd thing was that Luo Zheng still hadn't died. 'Is he immune to everything? Does this make him indestructible?' he mused.</p>

  <p>Yao and the Supreme Lords moved towards the giant hole and looked down at Luo Zheng. They had to keep their eyes glued to believe what was happening.</p>

  <p>After a while, Zheng's eyes twitched and eventually opened. As his gaze met Yao's, he smiled faintly before leaping up from the large hole.</p>

  <p>Beside him was Supreme Lord Shadow, being dragged along.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, Supreme Lord Shadow's state was a lot worse. The Profound Holy Thunder almost melted every bone in his body. He was holding on to life with Ying's Link of Life, and was left with one last breath.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng decided to go to the supreme world where the Demon Night reigned, he had his own reservations.</p>

  <p>The responsibility on him was too heavy, and without full confidence in him, he wouldn't have taken the risk in the first place.</p>

  <p>With the will of worlds, Luo Zheng could already be considered immortal with his power transfer technique.</p>

  <p>However, the power of a Supreme Lord's attack was not one to overlook.</p>

  <p>One strike from Yao's Profound Holy Thunder could destroy around one-third of the Celestial Wolf World's area. If she continued to attack this way, it would be enough to destroy all the life forms of a supreme world. Of course, this was not what Luo Zheng was looking for.</p>

  <p>However, his and Leroy's efforts were in vain. Facing Yao and Ying, he was left with no choice but to let go of some supreme worlds. In doing this, he killed warriors of the Sacred race as defense.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!"</p>

  <p>Yao shook her head abruptly. As she saw that Luo Zheng was unharmed, hatred and arrogance surged through her veins.</p>

  <p>Immediately, she dashed towards him with all her might.</p>

  <p>As she ran, she swung the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand like a boomerang. The weapon drew a marvelous shadow in the air before it smashed down on Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng held up his right index finger.</p>

  <p>Just a finger against the hammer being thrown at him? One would have thought he was a fool.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>But just like that, the hammer halted before it could make contact with him. The power had been transferred through his finger.</p>

  <p>Calmly, Luo Zheng sat firmly on the ground, content with what he did. He feared nothing at this point.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A determined glare plastered across Yao's face. She pulled the hammer back and swung it at Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With the lift of his finger, the hammer stopped in mid-air again. It dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>The rage in Yao's eyes became more and more intense as she swung the hammer over and over again, each swing faster than the last.</p>

  <p>In the same way, Luo Zheng had to only raise his finger to send the hammer away. Nobody could resist her hammer without being harmed. So Yao figured he must have managed to absorb the power of the hammer and fuse it with his own.</p>

  <p>Yao wasn't the only one in shock. Not far away, Ying, Korbin and Leroy also watched Luo Zheng with disbelief.</p>

  <p>The power emitted by the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer could not be completely neutralized. As they all knew, even if Luo Zheng could withstand the hammer, the power and the Thunder Law would cause the soil under his feet to collapse, creating yet another large crater.</p>

  <p>However, there wasn't even a crack in the ground where Luo Zheng sat. How was this possible?</p>

  <p>They all had the same conclusion that the hammer's attacks had been completely absorbed by Luo Zheng, leaving no trace of damage.</p>

  <p>In the long history of the Supreme Lords, they had never seen such an incredible ability. It was the first of its kind. No one had ever seen such a terrifying Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng did not even bear any Heavenly Destiny. He was merely a world lord. And also he was a Godly Genius. He hadn't even condensed his Godly Tile. This drew more and more confusion.</p>

  <p>In their minds, Luo Zheng had gone from being a monster to an amazement.</p>

  <p>Yao continuously swung her hammer, while Luo Zheng only pointed out one finger just as much. At times, he didn't even need to point one finger as he allowed the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer to land on his head, shoulders, and back.</p>

  <p>Yao felt as if her every strike was losing its power as the force depleted each and every time. Luo Zheng hadn't received any harm at all, and was completely unfazed by her attack.</p>

  <p>In another supreme world occupied by the Sacred race, the martial artists were suffering from an unexpected disaster. As invisible energies began to emerge, the world lords were struck by invisible attacks along with the power of thunder. During this time, martial artists were dying and wounded to no extent.</p>

  <p>The power of the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer was so great that it was terrifying. At one point, Yao had consumed too much of her energy and she dropped to the floor. Her chest rose and fell continuously as she gasped for air. The skin under her eyes puffed up as her pupils became visibly glassy.</p>

  <p>She was helpless. After catching Luo Zheng, all she had to do was destroy him.</p>

  <p>But she couldn't, and it made her feel foolish. How was this even possible?</p>

  <p>"Let me give it a try..."</p>

  <p>Seeing Yao's desperation, Ying floated down and hovered in front of Luo Zheng. Staring at him with gentle, moving eyes, she smiled and said, "If I'm not wrong, you seem to have the same theurgy as my leaves of Willow of Destruction."</p>

  <p>The willow leaves that sealed his power were from a plant created by Ying.</p>

  <p>This material could absorb any energy and have it transmitted to the trunk of the willow tree. In a certain corner of the world, Ying managed to plant millions of Willows of Destruction.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Luo Zheng used his power, it would be completely absorbed by the willow trees.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng smiled. "Maybe."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a feeling this was the case. Yes, the willow Leaves absorbed energy and transferred it to the tree trunks. Nonetheless, all the willow trees had a limit to their stock. Once the trunks reached their limit, the trees would die.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng's power transfer, wherever it was covered by the will of worlds, he could divert power. This made his power transfer a hundred times greater than Ying's.</p>

  <p>Ying didn't continue questioning him. There and then, a green light flashed in her eyes as she stretched out her hand and tapped Zheng's shoulder lightly. A green ripple began to spread across Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, seedlings sprouted around Luo Zheng. After they broke through the soil, golden vines extended from the seeds and wrapped around him within seconds. Soon after, Luo Zheng was completely bound in golden vines.</p>
