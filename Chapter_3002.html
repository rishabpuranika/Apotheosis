  <p>Faegan was the last to wake up.</p>

  <p>When he finally pried his eyes open, he discovered he was soaking in a large tank filled with a blood red liquid.</p>

  <p>The liquid was the sap of an insect containing the soul force capable of effectively healing damage to the soul.</p>

  <p>Faegan awoke enraged.</p>

  <p>He was about to burst out of the large tank and on his way when a woman flew from behind, forcing him back into the tank.</p>

  <p>"Master Faegan, you really are injured quite badly. You'd better remain in the tank a while longer to fully heal your wounds," the woman said very patiently, a sweet smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"I wish to see my father! How dare Ingram hurt me! I'll get my father to kick him from our clan!" Faegan exclaimed with great displeasure and resentment.</p>

  <p>On hearing this, the woman shook her head and said calmly, "I've already spoken with your father."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" Faegan asked, his eyes lighting up.</p>

  <p>"He said you deserved it," the woman said helplessly. "Although the Board of Elders has demoted Ingram, he is still a hero of the Qiu Clan. The Qiu Clan is to blame for what happened that year. Even the elders dare not mention this in front of Ingram, but you did. You're quite lucky he didn't kill you in a fit of anger."</p>

  <p>Faegan frowned and realized that he really was too rash. At the least he shouldn't have targeted Ingram.</p>

  <p>His heart still fluttered with fear when he thought of that dreadful scene.</p>

  <p>"Humph! I'll put this matter aside right now! Astrid, accompany me to kill that brat from the Sword Dance Palace!" Faegan yelled in demand.</p>

  <p>Astrid was an adopted daughter of the Qiu Clan and a great talent no doubt.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't join any palace, she had reached the Other Shore Realm under the training of the Qiu Clan. For her, killing a consummate True God would be child's play.</p>

  <p>Astrid and Faegan had a good relationship. Because of this, Faegan thought she would accept his offer without hesitation. Much to his surprise, Astrid shook her head solemnly and said, "Master Faegan, I can't."</p>

  <p>"Why is that?" Faegan asked, raising his voice. Astrid was always very obedient to him.</p>

  <p>"Your father will not allow it," Astrid answered in a feeble tone.</p>

  <p>"Fine! Then I'll find someone else!" There were many strong warriors in the Qiu Clan, so he, as the young master, would have no trouble in finding someone else to join him.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you can't do that either," Astrid said. "Master Laura has sent a message. She's asked you to work this out in the cultivation palace by yourselves, and your father has agreed."</p>

  <p>"How could this be possible?" Faegan frowned. "So I cannot do anything to Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," Astrid said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Faegan intrigued.</p>

  <p>"You can seek revenge using your own strength," Astrid said, blinking her eyes.</p>

  <p>With these words, Faegan fell silent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had mastered the Truth of Cultivation Nature. He moved swiftly like a ghost and boasted infinite power. How could he take revenge all on his own? He simply stood no chance!</p>

  <p>Half a day later, Faegan found Jago Yuebai.</p>

  <p>Once their wounds had healed, those over thirty playboys didn't go to the Sword Dance Palace, but instead gathered in a tavern in the Seven-Star City.</p>

  <p>"What? You're kidding. You've come across the same thing?" Faegan was a little stunned.</p>

  <p>Jago smoothed the fringe on his forehead and smacked his lips. "I kid you not. I can't order any guard in my clan. They act as if the matter does not concern them. And who on earth is  Luo Zheng? Why are our clans so afraid of him?"</p>

  <p>"He is just an outsider. I've never heard of the Excellence City. There is no truly powerful force in the Gracious Province!" exclaimed Faegan indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Yet they do not dare to make a move against him," said Jago in confusion.</p>

  <p>After thinking a while, Faegan said with a flash in his eyes, "Let's go to find Chadwick! Luo Zheng will be no match for us if we surround him with Chadwick's help!"</p>

  <p>"Chadwick?" Jago's face changed slightly at this suggestion.</p>

  <p>There were many playboys in the Sword Dance Palace, but there were still some talents among them. Chadwick certainly was one of them.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, however, he could not be found in the Sword Dance Palace. More importantly, he was a greedy man. It would cost them a lot of divine crystals to acquire his help.</p>

  <p>Still, they were determined to get even with Luo Zheng and humiliate him as they were humiliated.</p>

  <p>They then stormed out of the tavern. The other diners knew who they were so they dared not get in their way.</p>

  <p>On the top floor of the tavern, Laura quietly watched with a pale face what transpired downstairs.</p>

  <p>Beside Laura sat a grey haired old man. He was Faegan's grandfather and one of the three elders in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>"Is this really the right way to go about this?" asked the old man with knitted brows.</p>

  <p>Laura smiled and said, "They have to learn this lesson."</p>

  <p>"Is Luo Zheng really as great a talent as you have suggested? Has he really merged over one thousand Divine Dao at such a young age?" the old man asked both excited and concerned.</p>

  <p>Laura nodded and said, "His internal momentum is too complicated. I can't tell how many Divine Dao there are. It may be a thousand or two thousand."</p>

  <p>The old man's eyes were filled with astonishment. "It's impossible for such a person as this to come from the barren Gracious Province."</p>

  <p>"He is not a local there. He came through the Wild Goose Pass. But I'm unsure where his hometown is," Laura admitted in a low voice, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>She was in charge of the thirteen cultivation palaces of the Sword Light Palace. Given Luo Zheng's talent, he should be able to join the Burial Sword Palace or the Demon Sword Palace, but she had made a decision to leave Luo Zheng in the Sword Dance Palace temporarily.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, she could test Luo Zheng, and on the other hand, she could teach the playboys in the Seven-Star City with the help of Luo Zheng. It could be seen as killing two birds with one stone.</p>

  <p>But she didn't expect that Luo Zheng would go that far. On the first day, he had made the Sword Dance Palace a mess, and even made Ingram furious.</p>

  <p>That day, she had also been observing Luo Zheng secretly. If the situation got out of control, she would take action to stop it.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng knew what he was doing. She was quite pleased that he hadn't killed anyone.</p>

  <p>She had then informed all the clans of the Seven-Star City in advance that no one was allowed to make a move against Luo Zheng. She wondered how Faegan and other playboys would fight back with this in mind.</p>

  <p>The Sword Dance Palace was quiet for a few days. The eleven new members lived in the spacious backyard.</p>

  <p>Some goods were distributed in the palace, such as the cyan clothes and the cyan swords of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Of course, the cyan swords that Kenelm and the others received were different from the Stinger Guards', but they were enough to surprise and excite them.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Sword Light Palace had given them the most important thing, the translation of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, from which they could learn the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>
