<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Bright Sun World with his Teleportation Token, it would still take him a long time to pass through a supreme world.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to go to the Sword Manor, he had to go through the supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>Besides, he didn't know where exactly the Sword Manor was located, except that it was in the Bright Sun World. However, he soon realized that it wasn't that easy to enter the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>He was halfway down when he suddenly smacked his forehead, then took out the token of mountain.</p>

  <p>Apparently, he had forgotten to release Freya.</p>

  <p>As for Saul the puppet, he could stay in the fairy place and it wouldn't matter--he had even remained in the fairy palace for thousands of years.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Livingston was too engrossed in weapon refining that no one could force him out now.</p>

  <p>However, Freya had stayed in the fairy palace for several years. When she asked to come out during the time Luo Luo Zheng had just used the Teleportation Token, he rejected her. After all, there had been many uncertain dangers at that time; thus, Freya always listened to Luo Luo Zheng and never forced him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't afraid in any way, as even the Supreme Lords wouldn't be able to calculate that he had arrived in this supreme world in just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>After he had activated the token of mountain, he began to communicate with the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Freya eagerly waited at the door like she'd always have. If she felt that Luo Luo Zheng was under pressure, she wouldn't go out--even if she was dying to.</p>

  <p>Still, she couldn't be blamed for getting bored after being trapped in the fairy palace for several years.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng transmitted his voice, Freya suddenly appeared beside him. Since she didn't expect Luo Luo Zheng to be floating in the air when she appeared, she began to fall with a disheartening cry.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly pulled her hand and she was finally able to stabilize her body.</p>

  <p>Her eyes drifted to the vast plains in the universe, and she stretched her back with a satisfied smile. She had felt very much oppressed these years, but she never complained.</p>

  <p>She trailed Luo Luo Zheng behind. Huge maple leaves, which exerted a faint force of the flying ban, began to appear when they were about a thousand feet from the city.</p>

  <p>"Let's go in through the city gate," Luo Luo Zheng said after he and Freya had both circled around the city for a while.</p>

  <p>After some investigation, they found out that this city was located in the north of the Bright Sun World, and the Sword Manor was located in the southeast of the Bright Sun World.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng paid a few supreme life vitality crystals and brought Freya into the space channel, and then to the supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>The arduous journey took them nearly half a month to travel through the supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>Yet Freya was excited throughout the entire trip, like a prisoner who had been seemingly locked forever and had just obtained her freedom.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Xun had always been in a state of immersion as she hibernated within Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>After half a month, they finally left the supreme world channel and arrived at the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>While it was a proper manor, it didn't mean that it was weakly fortified.</p>

  <p>After all, the manor was considered the peak by independent warriors.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lords like Sword Chen were from the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>Freya was like a giddy little girl as she watched the light that was emitted by the Space Law dissipate, and she couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, "What a huge sword!"</p>

  <p>The Bright Sun World was a supreme world abundant in plains. After they exited the space channel, a large, flat city welcomed them. In the distance, a huge long sword stood firmly on the ground.</p>

  <p>The supreme world channel was extremely busy as a constant wave of people entered and exited. Someone couldn't help but roll his eyes when he heard Freya's words. "Look, we have a bumpkin?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Another man quickly interrupted him, warned him not to make irresponsible remarks, and then glanced apologetically at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already reached the Spirit Supreme Realm. Whenever his power increased by a level, so would his position in the eyes of those around him. A warrior in such a level could get a decent job in a tenth grade sacred place, so no ordinary warrior would want to provoke Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, it really is huge," Luo Luo Zheng mentally estimated the sword's size as he looked at it. The man-made sword was probably over a hundred thousand feet high. It might be the symbolic building of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>He only had one goal, and that was to go to the Sword Manor to hone his sword intent. He hoped to perfect the Emotion Closing Godly Way, so that his Lotus Flower could be perfect.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Sword Manor was a sacred place for all swordsmen. Even swordsmen from already powerful forces still went there to hone their sword intent. Xun was one of them years ago.</p>

  <p>After spending several pieces of life vitality crystals, Luo Luo Zheng made some inquiries from a local warrior. The warrior told him that the city where they were in was called Sword City, which boasted a strong swordsmanship atmosphere. There were also many sword schools throughout the city. It was said that even ordinary people received sword training for self-protection.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I'm afraid it won't be that convenient for you to visit the Sword Manor," the warrior said as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. Was there something wrong with him?</p>

  <p>The warrior glanced at him and continued, "You're a powerful warrior of the Spirit Supreme Realm, and can be considered important among the independent warriors. However, a rule from the ancient times is being strictly followed. That is, to enter the Sword Manor, you must first enter the sword school and obtain the nine-star sword token."</p>

  <p>"Nine-star sword token? What's that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. He was stunned.</p>

  <p>The warrior smiled and said, "You're a swordsman who has excellent achievements in the sword arts. Theoretically speaking, it wouldn't be hard to obtain the token. It's just that there are only three days left this month."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng mentally sighed. He thought that he could enter the Sword Manor as he wished. He didn't know that there was such a rule. Based from the warrior's words, it seemed that the rule had never been broken before in the history of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had previously left a sword-shaped mark on Luo Zheng's body, so it shouldn't be a problem for him to enter the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>But since the warrior said that no one had ever broken the rule before, he decided to follow it as well.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng thanked the warrior for his time, he quickly learned that there were many sword schools around the Sword Manor. All of their students were swordsmen and martial artists, who would obtain their own sword tokens after a series of battles.</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment and thought. He entered the Sword Manor the moment he set foot in the supreme world channel. However, the Sword Manor in that sense was apparently a broad term, which could be a place name or a powerful force. The key to entering the real Sword Manor was the nine-star sword token.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng asked the warrior to lead the way to a sword school without a second thought.</p>

  <p>After he entered a sword school he chose, he spent several life vitality crystals on a sword token of his own.</p>

  <p>Many swordsmen from outside worlds like Luo Luo Zheng were in the sword school as well. They hit a bottleneck in their cultivation, so they wanted to enter the Sword Manor in hopes of breaking through their shackles. However, they didn't know that the former owner of this Sword Manor was Luo Zheng's mentor of sorts, Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>After a while, the sword school sent someone to fight Luo Luo Zheng, but the man was only at the Life and Death Realm. How could he compare to Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>When he saw that Luo Luo Zheng was at the Spirit Supreme Realm, he too knew his fate.</p>

  <p>The winner was decided after just a single sword attack. Their fight was only a formality anyway, and Luo Luo Zheng left with a two-star sword token.</p>

  <p>Next, Luo Luo Zheng entered another relatively large sword school with the two-star sword token he had just gotten. After another sword attack, he got out with a three-star sword token.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng progressed, the schools he went to grew more imposing and larger in size. Naturally, his opponents also became increasingly formidable as well.</p>

  <p>However, he only needed one sword attack when he faced warriors of the Life and Death Realm and the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>A second move was unnecessary.</p>

  <p>In just half a day, Luo Zheng's token had gone from a three-star one to a six-star one already!</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng's speed was nothing to be proud of because his cultivation level was high already. Besides, it was only the threshold to enter the Sword Manor. It would be a great insult to his dignity if he had encountered any difficulties there.</p>

  <p>Freya just followed Luo Luo Zheng all throughout, bought a map of the Sword Manor and asked for some information in between. She quickly adapted to the new environment, so she was already able to serve as Luo Zheng's guide by the time he had gotten the seven-star token.</p>

  <p>"Only six big sword schools can give out eight-star and nine-star sword tokens. And the closest one is in that direction," Freya said. She thought for a moment before she reminded him, "These six big sword schools are equivalent to the ninth grade forces in the traditional sense. However, it should be very simple for you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. He was quite thankful for her presence, as the detailed information she had acquired was of great help to him.</p>
