<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 28 The Imperial Capital (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After traversing towering mountains and rolling hills, hiking over plains, passing many cities and various counties, Luo Zheng finally arrived in the Imperial Capital.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the high golden gate of the city, Luo Zheng was in awe. His mouth fell open in a silent 'wow'. Because he had thought that the C County was a large city. And he was surprised to see this golden gate which was several hundred feet high.</p>

  <p>Having read many books on the Imperial Capital, in which writers elaborated on the grandeur of the capital, Luo Zheng was mentally prepared for the magnificence and luxury of the capital. However, he was still profoundly shocked when he first stepped into the Imperial Capital and felt like a country bumpkin visiting a city for the first time.</p>

  <p>The books Luo Zheng had read were very detailed, and some had illustrations of the landscapes in the Imperial Capital, including illustrations like the golden gate towering over Luo Zheng now. The name of the gate was Heaven's Arch, which was four hundred feet high and one hundred feet wide.</p>

  <p>Thirty years ago, the Princess Qi of Ogre was married to the Prince of the Burning Empire, and the princess Qi brought the Heaven's Arch with her as her dowry.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng had imagined how the Heaven's Arch would look many times in the past, seeing the golden archway in person, he finally understood why this was the dowry Princess Qi brought with her. The Heaven's Arch was made of gold, and gemstones were inlaid over it, making gleam shine in the sun, with a rainbow of sparkling colors reflecting off it. Perhaps, Ogre wanted to make sure that the people in the Eastern Region knew every time they walked through this expensive dowry how poor they were.</p>

  <p>After passing through the Heaven's Arch, Luo Zheng walked along the Imperial Capital's main street, enjoying the local sights. As he walked, Luo Zheng even chanced to see the Incandescent Pavilion that stood majestically over 1000 feet high. He saw the enormous Temple of Dragon and several chariots flying by.</p>

  <p>Though intrigued, Luo Zheng did not stop to enjoy these stunning spectacles. His interest was in finding the Cloud Sect, and Luo Zheng wouldn't stop until he reached his destination.</p>

  <p>Periodically stopping as he strolled down the street slowed Zheng's trip.</p>

  <p>Because he asked anyone he could about the Cloud Sect. Finally, he came to the Cloud Sect after searching for an entire day.</p>

  <p>The tremendous Cloud Sect made up nearly a quarter of the Imperial Capital, which was several times larger than the Imperial Palace. If the rolling Cloud Mountains that lay behind the Cloud Sect was counted, the area of the Cloud Sect would be much larger.</p>

  <p>Compared with the luxuriousness of the dazzling Heaven's Arch, the gate leading to the Cloud Sect seemed plain. Aside from two words in large lettering at the top of the gate, there were no decorations. Surrounding the entrance were large green trees that had green vines entwined. Each factor added to the charm of the ancient building.</p>

  <p>In front of the gate, two lines formed for sign-ups.</p>

  <p>The one to the left had only no more than ten people, while the line on the right extended for miles. At a glance, it was difficult to see where this group's line ended. Luo Zheng counted quickly in his head and surmised that there were more than a thousand people waiting to the right.</p>

  <p>He did not know the difference between these two lines, so, he went to the left first. There were not so many people and soon, it was Zheng's turn.</p>

  <p>The receptionist in charge of enrolling the students glanced up at Luo Zheng, and extended his hand as he demanded,"Please, show me your noble clan certificate."</p>

  <p>"Noble clan certificate?" echoed Luo Zheng in a surprised manner.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's blank look, the receptionist pointed down at his table while he explained,"This line is only for applicants from noble clans. If you do not have a noble clan certificate, you need to be in that line." As he spoke, the receptionist pointed to the long line to the right.</p>

  <p>That cleared up any confusion Luo Zheng had about why there weren't many people standing in line here. It was dedicated to serving those of noble clans.</p>

  <p>The noble clan was a special class bestowed on families by the emperor.</p>

  <p>Throughout the entire Empire, there were only a small number of powerful families which were deemed noble clan, and most of those families were located in the Imperial Capital.</p>

  <p>Since the Luo Clan of C County was not one of the noble clans, Luo Zheng could not show the noble clan certificate to the receptionist.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene unfolded, people standing in the long line burst into laughter with contemptuous looks on their faces. Waiting in line like that was boring, aside from gossiping with each other to pass the time, there was nothing to do. Zheng's actions broke the monotony and were entertaining for the people standing there waiting for their turns.</p>

  <p>"Where did this bumpkin come from?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't know what the noble clan certificate was. How dare he come to the Cloud Sect? Do you see what kind of people come to the Cloud Sect these days? That's funny."</p>

  <p>Ignoring the taunts, Luo Zheng didn't acknowledge the harassing opinions and gave the receptionist a nod before walking to the end of the line on the right. Contemptuous glares from other hopeful applicants followed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The past two years that Luo Zheng lived as a slave in the Luo Clan, and his harrowing escape from death had numbed Luo Zheng to the sort of insignificant provocations and ridicules these strangers tossed at him. Right now, nothing could annoy him.</p>

  <p>The line was moving slowly, and since Luo Zheng didn't know anyone there, he decided to use the time to refresh himself and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is this your first time here to take the initial exam?" came a gentle voice unexpectedly from in front of Luo Zheng.</p>
