  <p>
</p>

  <p>These blue pillars were enough to seal the whole Li Shan mountain. Once they were formed, it would be difficult to break even if Gerald and Judson joined forces to try.</p>

  <p>As such, Herbert was very confident it was foolproof.</p>

  <p>However, just as the blue pillars were rising into the sky, a faint golden light shot towards them like a streak of lightning.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the golden light beam, Herbert gasped. He could feel the immense power contained in it. Spreading out his hands instinctively, he released truth energy from his palms and directed it towards the blue pillars.</p>

  <p>Then, the blue pillars were coated in a light blue film, which stabilized them.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the pale golden light hit the blue pillars, it exploded violently.</p>

  <p>The once stable blue pillars immediately shook like toothpicks, and many even collapsed.</p>

  <p>Even Othniel was shocked when he felt the power of the golden light.</p>

  <p>It was very easy to distinguish the truth energy. This golden light was obviously not a kind of truth energy from Gerald or Judson, nor could it be from the Snake Goddess or Fuxi. However, if that were the case, then who else in the Li Shan mountain was strong enough to release such energy?</p>

  <p>Quickly recovering from his initial shock, Herbert snorted, "It won't be that easy to destroy my prison."</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>From the area where blue pillars collapsed, new ones sprung from the earth to quickly replace them, like a hydra.</p>

  <p>Herbert might have been the most quiet among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, but he was also the most determined. Once he decided to make a move, he would prepare solutions to deal with every possible situation he might face.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, it was futile for the Li Shan mountain to use powerful energy to stop the prison from forming. He knew that he'd be able to deal with whatever they threw his way.</p>

  <p>From the peak of the Li Shan mountain, Yan smiled as she watched the golden beam knock down multiple blue pillars.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of living beings of the Li Shan mountain were here, including her brother, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi...</p>

  <p>This was their last stronghold. No way in hell was she going to sit back and watch it be destroyed before her.</p>

  <p>"What the--"</p>

  <p>When Yan saw the new blue pillars emerging from the ground, the smile was wiped from her face, and her eyes flashed coldly. Through gritted teeth, she muttered, "Let's see if you can grow pillars faster than I can chop them down."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she flicked her ten fingers.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the energy that had been pulsating in the "golden dress" below her gathered at the Energy Shaft. Under Yan's control, the Energy Shaft shot out many golden light blades.</p>

  <p>The ability to control energy was innate to Yan. The first time she condensed the shadow of Snake Goddess, she had instantly mastered it.</p>

  <p>This was why the Snake Goddess had chosen Yan to cultivate the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The golden light rained on the blue pillars. Any pillar that touched the golden light blades instantly collapsed.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how many pillars were smashed to pieces, new ones emerged to take their place. For Herbert, summoning blue pillars was as easy as breathing.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>Even the massive Li Shan mountain began to shake slightly under the impact.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, mountain peaks would collapse and rocks would roll down along the mountain.</p>

  <p>However, no one bothered to bat an eyelash at this collateral damage. This was no big deal compared to what they were up against.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, who had been hovering in the air nearby, watched as the golden light beams tore down pillars while new ones sprouted like bamboos. She pursed her lips, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>At this point, Herbert's and Yan's moves could only be regarded as a way to test the water.</p>

  <p>Yan shouldn't have been the first to fight, since she was one of the Li Shan mountain's trump cards.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess had arranged for her to be the first one to take action. Her hope was that by doing so, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race would feel intimidated. At the very least, she wanted to give an impression that the Li Shan mountain was a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>The tug-of-war became like a game of seesaw. Two hours of this back-and-forth dynamic passed by.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, Herbert's truth energy could last long, and he was not afraid of it being consumed by the passing of time.</p>

  <p>On the other, Yan relied on the power of thousands of warriors in the Li Shan mountain. While these warriors were contributing their power, they were also constantly replenishing the divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Before the war began, the Li Shan mountain distributed all the divine crystals that had been tucked away over the years. Thus, they could hold out for probably a month.</p>

  <p>Another six hours passed.</p>

  <p>Both sides appeared to be very patient, especially Yan. This was her first time to face a Chaos Ancient God. She wasn't going to risk it all by being careless! Her eyes flashed determinedly, as she continued sending golden beams of light towards the blue pillars.</p>

  <p>However, Othniel didn't feel the same way. Exasperated, he saw no point in what Herbert was doing. If even after eight hours they couldn't build a prison, then they should stop wasting time on it!</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Othniel's huge eyeball flashed suddenly, and a huge ball appeared before him.</p>

  <p>Then, spikes that spanned a million feet long appeared one after another all around the ball. As they appeared, they squeezed into the ball. In a short while, there were already over ten thousand spikes inside the ball.</p>

  <p>"Shrink!"</p>

  <p>Othniel spat impatiently.</p>

  <p>The ball began to shrink rapidly, and the one-million-foot long spikes inside the ball were also quickly compressed. Soon the ball was roughly the size of a massive boulder.</p>

  <p>Then, Othniel stretched out his hands and touched the surface of the ball gently, and a blue square enveloped the ball. Instantly, the ball was teleported into the Li Shan mountain without a warning.</p>

  <p>Through the Cloud Cover Array, Yan could sense if anything had entered the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>As soon as she noticed the presence of the ball, she flicked her finger towards it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A golden light blade hit the ball.</p>

  <p>The ball by itself was already on the verge of bursting, since it was loaded to the brim with massive spikes.</p>

  <p>Even a full blow from an ordinary warrior at the Other Shore Realm could easily shatter it, let alone Yan's golden light blade.</p>

  <p>However, the instant the ball shattered, it exploded and sent the one-million-foot long spikes raining onto the Cloud Cover Array like meteors.</p>

  <p>As the spikes swept across the Li Shan mountain, peaks were sliced off and craters were formed.</p>

  <p>If they were to land on a sect in the Li Shan mountain, the entire sect would be destroyed, and the people inside would also be crushed to a pulp.</p>

  <p>Even the arrays set up on the mountains along the way were destroyed by the spikes.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his attack was working, Othniel continued. Three more round balls appeared in front of him, and at the same time, more spikes squeezed in.</p>

  <p>In a flash of blue light, more balls were sent into the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>But by now, the Li Shan mountain knew what to expect.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Judson appeared in front of one of the balls, and a glazed goblet had appeared in his hand. It was the Heavenly Glazed Goblet.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Judson threw it at the ball. The goblet swallowed it instantly.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The round ball exploded inside the glazed goblet. The countless spikes were effectively blocked by the goblet's shell.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the second ball was swallowed by Gerald, who had appeared just in time.</p>

  <p>The spikes might cause damage to Gerald's body, but ordinary injuries were nothing to him.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess handled the last ball.</p>

  <p>While she might be inferior to Gerald and Judson in terms of strength, she was still extremely clever and wise. The instant the third ball appeared over the Li Shan mountain, she had tossed a thin rope towards it. The moment the rope looped around the ball, it was transported into the interior of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The area in the center of the Li Shan mountain was incredibly vast. Even though the ball exploded inside the Li Shan mountain, the walls of the mountain were too incredibly thick that the spikes just buried themselves into the mountain after traveling tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of feet in the rock stratum.</p>
