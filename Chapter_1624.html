<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sword Chen didn't have much interest in the martial artists that passed through the Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>He had entered the Godly Way through Emotion Closing. He also knew that he had entered a path that was forbidden, and he had long since given up the idea of passing on the technique to anyone.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even though there were quite a few martial artists who passed by his torch, he had never taken any of them seriously.</p>

  <p>There had been a few swordsmen that were extremely talented. With their great determination, they hadn't flinched the slightest at any of the challenges from the rain of swords that had fallen, and they had climbed all the way up to the mountain. But in the end, they had all been chased away by Sword Chen with his Gods-intimidating Sword.</p>

  <p>However, now, Sword Chen had met a guy who had comprehended the Gods-intimidating Strike!</p>

  <p>Moreover, his level of comprehension of this technique was quite impressive.</p>

  <p>He had comprehended 99% of it. With one more percent of comprehension, he would reach consummation of the Gods-intimidating Strike!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, this guy had not only comprehended the Gods-intimidating Strike but had also opened 35 petals in his Lotus Flower. He would achieve consummation with just one more lotus petal.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Sword Chen, Luo Zheng was like a perfect jade with a missing corner.</p>

  <p>And that missing corner was in his hand. All he needed to was to reach out and gently put the missing corner back. Then, he would be flawless!</p>

  <p>As he received Sword Chen's praise, Luo Zheng stood rooted to the spot without saying anything.</p>

  <p>After sizing Luo Zheng up from head to toe, Sword Chen asked, "Have you ever had a master?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng answered honestly.</p>

  <p>A hint of disappointment flashed through Sword Chen's eyes when he heard this answer. However, he smiled faintly. He could be considered half a master to Luo Zheng as he had taught him the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that the Emotion Closing Godly Way is a forbidden way?" Sword Chen continued to ask.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes. I got to know it a while ago."</p>

  <p>"Then, do you know why the Emotion Closing Godly Way is a forbidden way?" Sword Chen asked again.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was, after all, only at the Soul Sea Realm. His current knowledge about the cultivation levels was limited to the Spirit Supreme Realm and those below it. He knew that a warrior who reached the Spirit Supreme Realm could create beings within their consciousness. As for the differences among Spirit Transformation Realm, the world lord, and the Supreme Lord, he knew nothing.</p>

  <p>Then there were the various Godly Ways, of which he only knew the names. When it came to what they really meant, he was like a naive child facing the ways of the complicated world� he didn't understand them at all.</p>

  <p>"It's fine that you don't know." Sword Chen did not intend to explain it to Luo Zheng. He only said, "Your Gods-intimidating Strike is close to perfection, but it still lacks one thing. Do you know what that is?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing these words, Zheng's expression became extremely serious.</p>

  <p>Six years ago, Luo Zheng had already practiced the Gods-intimidating Strike and reached 99% of its technique. But when he had slashed with his sword using the Gods-intimidating Strike, he had had the feeling that something was missing and he'd been unable to perform it perfectly.</p>

  <p>In the past six years, apart from cultivating the Eight Smoky Melodies, Thunderbolt Annihilation, and Enemy Repelling Arts, he had also been constantly comprehending the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had been stuck in a predicament regarding this swordsmanship technique for six years and had not made the slightest bit of progress since then.</p>

  <p>Xun had once tried to help him think of ways to solve this, and the cyan dragon had also come up with a few ideas, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, with all his talent, hadn't been able to completely comprehend the Gods-intimidating Strike even after spending six years trying to master it.</p>

  <p>He had considered all the possible ways and tried all the methods he could think of, but he'd made no progress.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had then told Luo Zheng that the last 1% of the Gods-intimidating Strike perhaps didn't lie within Luo Zheng. Since he could not comprehend the last bit on his own, he might have to look for external help.</p>

  <p>"Sir, please help me," Luo Zheng said seriously.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen replied, "If you want to know the answer, then you should go to the Sword Manor. There, you will find the answer."</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor was not a grade ten sacred place.</p>

  <p>It had initially been formed by a group of independent sword cultivators.</p>

  <p>After countless years of development, the Sword Manor had gradually evolved into a strong force that specialized in swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>However, the person who had made the Sword Manor a significant place in the universe was none other than Sword Chen!</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor had long since become a sacred place for all the swordsmen in the universe.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain was in the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>"The Sword Manor..." Luo Zheng repeated these words and kept them in mind.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Sword Chen waved his hand and the Gods-intimidating Sword flew toward Luo Zheng, coming to a sudden halt just before it could hit him.</p>

  <p>A cyan light appeared on the tip of the sword and danced around Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>After a moment, the cyan light formed a sword-shaped pattern on the surface of his arm and flickered for a while before disappearing into his arm.</p>

  <p>"This... is all I can do for you." Sword Chen sighed. There was a complicated expression in his eyes. "You can go now."</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As Sword Chen waved his hand, the illusion of the Killing Sword Mountain dissipated and turned into a flame that condensed on the torch.</p>

  <p>The look in Sword Chen's eyes...</p>

  <p>At the last moment, Luo Zheng noticed the strange expression in Sword Chen's eyes.</p>

  <p>Had he encountered any trouble after becoming a True God?</p>

  <p>No matter what trouble it was, with Zheng's current strength, it was impossible for him to interfere and be of any help to Sword Chen. There was no point worrying about it.</p>

  <p>Since Sword Chen had told him that the missing piece he needed to fully comprehend the Gods-intimidating Strike was hidden within the Sword Manor, he would probably have to pay a visit to the Sword Manor after this Illusion Battlefield ended.</p>

  <p>This time, in his journey across the Corridor of Emperor, what Luo Zheng had obtained was more than just this piece of news. After sparing with Sword Chen for about a million strikes, he had greatly honed his sword intent.</p>

  <p>He had gained a lot, but he did not know if there would be any rewards after he passed the fifth Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The last Hall of Causality was different from the former ones. There wasn't much danger in the Corridor of Emperor. The only thing that might be a burden was the pressure of numerous True Gods' soul marks.</p>

  <p>However, martial artists could feel the Godly Way in the pressure, and from a certain point of view, this was the best reward.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng thought about this, he walked forward. While he advanced, he carefully paid attention to the murals on both sides of the Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>These murals depicted how Sword Chen had tempered his will as he dedicated his life to cultivating swordsmanship before joining the Sword Manor. They also depicted how he had become the master of the Killing Sword Mountain and how he had fought in the Orange Sea World back then�</p>

  <p>The soul within the lamp once again let out a soft sigh.</p>

  <p>Among the 3000 Godly Ways, only one of them was a forbidden way, and that was the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>In the past, when Sword Chen cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way, he had obtained great benefits that had made his strength far exceed the strength of any ordinary True God. Even when he was a Supreme Lord, he had possessed the strength to harm a True God.</p>

  <p>However, that couldn't change the fact that the journey he had embarked on was a forbidden way.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way was something forbidden to begin with...</p>

  <p>Now, although Sword Chen had understood the consequences, he had no choice but to hide somewhere as he was being hunted down by a mighty God.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng's receding figure, Sword Chen was also very puzzled.</p>

  <p>The person behind this boy had paid a huge price to cover his fate, but why had he made him cultivate the Emotion Closing Godly Way?</p>

  <p>What was that person trying to do?</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued on his way forward, he did not meet any more torches on the wall.</p>

  <p>'Is it that each warrior can only encounter ten torches in this Corridor of Emperor, namely the ten True Gods' soul marks? Or could it be that... in this universe, there have only been ten True Gods throughout the countless grand eras?'</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, Luo Zheng quickly shook his head. True Gods were indeed rare, but the number of them could not be so low.</p>

  <p>After traveling for a while, Luo Zheng saw the exit of the Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>When he walked out the exit, he discovered that the six separate Corridors of Emperor converged at the end. Where he stood now was in a circular hall, and there were already other martial artists waiting here.</p>

  <p>"Janet, Hailey!"</p>

  <p>It turned out that the two female warriors of their group had already passed through the Corridor of Emperor and come out.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, we're so glad that you've come out!" Janet smiled sweetly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The three of them looked at one another, only to discover that there was a slight change in all three of them.</p>

  <p>This change was inevitable after they got some insight on the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Even if a martial artist hadn't found the Godly Way that suited them, as long as they had passed by the soul flames, they could feel the Mu Ning of those True Gods.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Mu Ning didn't mean to test one's soul, but it was still beneficial for martial artists.</p>

  <p>"It was quite easy to pass the fifth Hall of Causality," Hailey said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Which True Gods did you meet? I met the legendary Master Shiloh."</p>

  <p>Janet smiled with a hint of excitement in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head slightly and casually named a few of the True Gods he had met. This was not a secret that could not be revealed. However, Luo Zheng didn't mention meeting Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>As they talked, a human figure flashed in the Corridor of Emperor. They all turned around and saw Jeffrey walking out of it.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey put his hands together, slightly closing his eyes while mumbling something, as if he was a monk who had made great achievements.</p>

  <p>When he completely walked out of the Corridor of Emperor, he smiled at Luo Zheng and the others and said, "I've received advice from the Past Buddha�"</p>

  <p>There was no such concept as Godly Way in the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>What they called Buddhism was the same thing as Godly Way.</p>

  <p>And the Past Buddha was the Dipamkara Buddha.</p>
