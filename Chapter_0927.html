  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I, I can't take it anymore!"</p>

  <p>As everyone walked quietly, Shane suddenly let out a scream and broke the silence.</p>

  <p>In this thick fog, they felt extremely alert and sensitive. Everything around them was depressing. Shane and others were already on the verge of despair.</p>

  <p>Fabian, Jarrod and Esther however were still calm. After all, they had passed through the Gate of Samsara and cultivated a high level on their warrior spirit. On the other hand, Shane and the others hadn't entered the Gate of Samsara. Their warrior spirit was far from being stable enough to fight dangerous situations. They lacked confidence to face what was ahead of them and it could be imagined how frightened they felt at the moment.</p>

  <p>"If we stop and stay where we are, we'll just die here," Malcom said indifferently. He was not in the mood to care about Shane.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible for us to get out of here! We will die at this damned forsaken place!" Shane said with a crazily despaired look on his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh? You really think so?" Malcom waved his fists towards Shane, "If you don't shut up I'll send you to hell right now!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Malcom was really going to give a blow, Shane immediately shut his mouth.</p>

  <p>In such bad circumstances, it was indeed not a wise choice to speak such depressing words like Shane did. It could very easily break the nerves of others!</p>

  <p>At that moment, one of the top-level war lords from the Demon Night suddenly pointed forward and shouted, "Look! What is that?"</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to look in the direction he was pointing to and saw a red dot in the distance.</p>

  <p>This strange red dot hung in the sky like a rising sun in the morning mist.</p>

  <p>The fog that surrounded them was thick enough to block everyone's sights.</p>

  <p>No one could see anything 1000 feet away. How was the light emitted by that red dot able to penetrate through the layers of fog? Everyone could see it clearly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his head as his eyes flickered with a bright jade-green light.</p>

  <p>Even his magic vision wasn't able to look through the strange fog. However, when he activated his vision ability, the red dot became a little clearer.</p>

  <p>"This light reminds me of the Dark Nether Death Light. Don't you think so?" Luo Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>Esther nodded and agreed, "You're right. It's very likely that all of the Dark Nether Death Light in the Dark Nether Cave originated from this red dot shrouded in mist!"</p>

  <p>"Which means that after walking for so long we are not getting away from the fog. Instead, we're actually getting closer and closer to the core area. We are actually moving towards the wrong direction? the direction of the core area!" As Fabian drew this conclusion he looked extremely frightened.</p>

  <p>Everyone couldn't help but swallow hard in fear. They didn't know what was in the core area, but obviously, they would get easily killed no matter what it was.</p>

  <p>"Let's move away from it!" Malcom's eyes lit up as he suggested, "Since we have the red dot as reference, we can move away from it and find our way out! Anyway, it won't be wrong to get away from that red dot!"</p>

  <p>Malcom's suggestion immediately received everyone's approval.</p>

  <p>According to Luo Zheng's theory, without something to guide them they had been walking in circles the whole time. But now, with the red dot as their reference object, as long as they kept moving away from it, they would eventually be able to find their way out!</p>

  <p>Suddenly their hearts were swollen with hope. The way out was just around the corner.</p>

  <p>Everyone started to get excited, except for Luo Luo Zheng, who revealed a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>He knew it was not that easy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had started the journey with his own reference object, but even so, he could feel that there was something wrong as they walked forward. There was something about that mist that surrounded them and it was getting more difficult to get out of there.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Luo Zheng decided not to say anything. Now that everyone had decided to give it a try, he had no reason to stop them. He had no other choice as well. Thus, everyone followed Malcom and continued to move away from the red dot.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt excited after realizing they could use the red dot as a reference to find their way out. They walked as fast as they could hoping they would soon leave the fog if they kept moving like this.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that the space ring hanging on his chest was becoming hotter and hotter. Needless to say, they were now closer to the core area instead of moving away from it.</p>

  <p>As he realized what was actually going on, Shane suddenly let out an astonished cry. He pointed at the red dot in the sky and stammered,</p>

  <p>"That...that red dot is getting bigger and bigger!"</p>

  <p>When everyone raised their heads, the hopeful expressions on their faces vanished.</p>

  <p>A moment before, the red dot hanging in the sky had been just a dim dot. It had now grown to the size of a fist. This meant that they were getting closer and closer to it.</p>

  <p>"This is so weird! We have been moving in the opposite direction, then why is the distance between us and that thing getting shorter and shorter?" A top-level war lord of the Night Group trembled as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Esther bit her lips nervously, unable to understand what was happening around her.</p>

  <p>"There is only one explanation: there is an invisible force in this fog that is guiding us closer to the core area. Perhaps it is dragging us towards it and we can't notice it!" Malcom tried to analyze the situation rationally.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Yolande suddenly broke her silence and said, "We won't be able to walk out of this fog."</p>

  <p>Malcom and the others weren't aware, but Esther and Fabian were clear that Yolande knew a lot about the Dark Nether Cave. So they asked her, almost at the same time, "What exactly happened? Is there a way to deal with it?"</p>

  <p>Yolande answered flatly, "Yes, there is."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say something earlier?!" Fabian opened his eyes wide in shock. They had been struggling trying to find a way out, yet Yolande had kept quiet the whole time knowing the truth. At this moment, Fabian didn't know what he should say to this strange girl.</p>

  <p>But Yolande then added with an expressionless face, "There is a way out, but you won't make it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Esther asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"This fog is actually a particular formation that contains the power of the Space Law," Yolande replied. "If you want to leave this fog, you need to be proficient in the third layer of the Space Law but none of you have achieved this."</p>

  <p>"The third layer of the Space Law!? Are you serious?" A bitter smile appeared on Jarrod's face.</p>

  <p>Among this group of cultivators, only two of them were proficient in the Space Law. One of them was Luo Luo Zheng, and the other was Jarrod. Luo Luo Zheng was now slowly learning the second layer of the Space Law. When he was at the Genuine Dragon World, he managed to achieve the first layer of the Space Law with the help of the obelisks. Recently, he had gathered the foundations of the second layer of the Space Law with the help of the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>After that, he had used his points to borrow the remaining stone tablets in the Tower of Sin for cultivation. Even so, he had only grasped about half of the second layer of the Space Law, and it was still a long way from fully understanding the second layer of the law.</p>

  <p>As for Jarrod, he was way behind Luo Luo Zheng in his cultivation. He hadn't even completely mastered the first layer of the Space Law, and he had only comprehended a tiny bit of its second layer.</p>

  <p>According to Yolande, they should be proficient in the third layer of Space Law if they wanted to get out of this place but none had reached this level.</p>

  <p>Did this mean that they should try to comprehend the Space Law here?</p>

  <p>Who knew how long it would take to grasp the third layer of Space Law.</p>

  <p>By then, the fog would have dispersed and everyone would have died under the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>"Is this the only way to get out of here?" Fabian turned to Yolande and asked again.</p>

  <p>"Not really," Yolande replied in the same quiet tone.</p>

  <p>Everyone was feeling annoyed with Yolande's careless way of speaking.</p>

  <p>They all stared at her angrily, while Xun only revealed a cold sneer.</p>

  <p>She knew Yolande's personality and that this girl had always been like this.</p>

  <p>"What is the other way if there indeed is one? Can you just say it once and for all?" Malcom said angrily.</p>

  <p>Yolande, without caring that they were shouting and getting angrier by the second, slowly explained, "We have to find the array plate that controls the array. Only then will we be able to leave."</p>

  <p>"Where is the array plate?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head, "I've never been to the Dark Nether Cave before, and this is my first time here. I don't know how to find it. But my guess is that it's somewhere in the core area."</p>

  <p>"Well, since you've never been in here before, how do you know about these things of the Dark Nether Cave?" Malcom asked as he stared at Yolande with doubtful eyes.</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked, lowered her head staring at the floor covered in fog and said, "I won't tell you."</p>

  <p>"She keeps acting like this!" someone complained.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Malcom almost went berserk and was about to attack Yolande.</p>

  <p>He suppressed the anger rising in his heart, and sighed deeply, "Now let's move on and see where our fates will guide us to! If it's impossible for us to leave here, we'll head straight to the core area. If the luck is on our side, we might even get rare treasures and opportunities there!"</p>

  <p>Nobody said a word. Under such circumstances they had no other choice but to follow him.</p>

  <p>Resigned to their bad luck they felt calmer and ready to face all kinds of situations ahead. This was the only thing they could do. If they were to end their lives in this place, they could do nothing but give their best shot at fighting it.</p>

  <p>The red dot hanging in the sky had now grown to the size of a plate. They began to feel the power of the Dark Nether Death Light growing stronger.</p>

  <p>Even though the thick fog still surrounded them, the Dark Nether Death Light was able to penetrate through it. It was a life-or-death situation. The ultimate test was to defend their lives from the deadly light.</p>
