<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The large clans on the Floating Islands got 80% of the resources in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The countless second-tier and third-tier clans took up 15%.</p>

  <p>And the vast majority in the divine land, the divine citizens, shared the remaining 5%.</p>

  <p>If the divine citizens wanted to achieve something great, they needed to enter various divine cities and climb up the pyramid through the proving godly houses. And those with remarkable talents had a chance to enter the Floating Islands and obtain valuable resources.</p>

  <p>"The most important resources are in the forbidden lands," Master Evil emphasized. "Divine might coins and all sorts of rare treasures are in them. However, almost all the entrances to the forbidden lands are controlled by the large clans on the Floating Islands. Ordinary citizens, even True Gods, have no chance of getting in."</p>

  <p>"I was lucky to enter the Soul Wilderness once," Master Evil reminisced with a shake of his head. "And because of this rare opportunity, I obtained rewards that were almost equal to my efforts in several divine eras!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil had just become a mid-rank True God then. He didn't have much strength or influence and he was barely known in the Vast Sky Region but one day, he joined a group of powerful warriors from large clans and followed them into the Soul Wilderness. He had suffered a lot in that place, but found it all worth it in the end as he obtained spoils that helped him reach the top level of a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Since then, Master Evil managed to make a name for himself in the northern part of the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>In fact, with his power and influence, he could have established a third-tier clan. However, given his reclusive and single-minded tendencies, he never did such a thing and instead, set his mind into becoming a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>The True Gods living on the Floating Islands practically had endless resources, and still, it was difficult for them to become a top-rank True God. And for the True Gods born as divine citizens like Master Evil, every step they took towards the top of pyramid was as difficult as crossing a natural chasm!</p>

  <p>Master Evil had his chance with the Stone Mouse but when things did not go according to plan, he had landed in such a pathetic situation.</p>

  <p>"The forbidden lands are more important than I have expected," mumbled Luo Luo Zheng, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>Master Evil chuckled. "Although I hadn't been to a Floating Island in the past, I believe it won't be long before you get the chance to go to a forbidden land." Feeling envious of Luo Luo Zheng, Master Evil let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>He was here as well, but was left with only his remnant soul.</p>

  <p>One night passed.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning, a woman dressed in plain clothes came to escort Luo Luo Zheng to the Dream Pavilion of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>On their way to the Dream Pavilion, Luo Luo Zheng encountered many other women who all stopped and gave him curious looks.</p>

  <p>He thought it was Joy who sent for him but he was way wrong.</p>

  <p>A group of proving godly warriors was waiting in the Dream Pavilion.</p>

  <p>All of them were women.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, this group of proving godly warriors had only joined the Purple Soul Hall not long ago. They restrained themselves from looking Luo Luo Zheng up and down but all of them had a surprised look in their eyes. In their heads, they wondered why a man would suddenly come in.</p>

  <p>The woman who brought Luo Luo Zheng into the Dream Pavilion addressed the crowd in a serious voice. "Madam Moon will come and talk to you later.</p>

  <p>You know her temper, so please be quiet!"</p>

  <p>The chattering died at the mention of Madam Moon's name. Luo Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow. It looked like Madam Moon had quite the reputation.</p>

  <p>Not long after the woman in plain clothes left, a fat old lady slowly stepped in from the back door of the Dream Pavilion. She looked odd with the body of an old wrinkly woman and a face as tender as a baby's.</p>

  <p>'This must be Madam Moon, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>The room's atmosphere turned intense in seconds and the women warriors had all halted and tensed. Fear was evident in their faces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows furrowed together. What had Madam Moon done that made these women so afraid of her? Both Mae and Madam Moon were top-rank True Gods, but Mae obviously had a much better hold of her temper. Luo Luo Zheng vaguely remembered her saying that every one of the Purple Soul Hall was equal except for Joy.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon stopped in front of the crowd, her eyes sweeping over them once before landing on Luo Luo Zheng. She narrowed her beady little eyes. "I heard you were chosen by Master Joy. Why can't I feel any Purple Power Body Mu Ning from you?"</p>

  <p>This was only the second day since Luo Luo Zheng was brought into the Purple Soul Hall by Mae. He guessed that Madam Moon probably had something to tell him but settled for asking him questions first.</p>

  <p>"You are right, Madam. I don't have the Purple Power Body," said Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon frowned. "You don't have the Purple Power Body? So then why did Master allow you to join the Purple Soul Hall?"</p>

  <p>"Because I can also cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao," Luo Luo Zheng explained in a calm voice.</p>

  <p>"Show me!" Madam Moon ordered impatiently.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned, irritation slowly rising. This old woman had one terrible temper and what looked like zero patience. However, Luo Luo Zheng was new to this place and was still unfamiliar with it so he just took a deep breath and held on to his patience.</p>

  <p>Stretching his hand out, Luo Luo Zheng flipped his palm and formed a purple Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The purple internal momentum circled around once before dissipating.</p>

  <p>Surprised, Madam Moon nodded her head. "Well, I don't know how you did it. But since you've been allowed to join the Purple Soul Hall, you're one of us now." She then produced a jade token from her sleeve and tossed it to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Take it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng extended his arms and caught the token in his cupped hands. The character of the clan name "Han" was carved on the top of the token and the name "Tianxing Luo" was carved on the bottom. The token emitted a faint and complex Mu Ning, and Luo Luo Zheng guessed that it was made by some kind of secret technique.</p>

  <p>"This is the token of the Han Clan. You can do nothing without it on the Floating Island, so don't lose it."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Madam," Luo Luo Zheng replied meekly.</p>

  <p>"You've just entered the Floating Island so I have to explain some rules to you..." Madam Moon then relayed some basic rules of the Floating Island in detail.</p>

  <p>She spoke in a wordy way, repeating each sentence several times. Luo Luo Zheng grew impatient every passing minute but willed himself to listen and school his facial expressions.</p>

  <p>When Madam Moon finally finished, she turned to the group of women warriors in the corner. It was then that Luo Luo Zheng realized how "kind" Madam Moon was acting with him.</p>

  <p>"Those who rank in the bottom three hundred this month, stand out now!" Madam Moon ordered in a thundering voice.</p>

  <p>Three of the women warriors felt chills up their spine and began to tremble when they heard her words.</p>

  <p>"I said now!" Madam Moon roared.</p>

  <p>The three women dragged themselves out of the crowd with shaking legs as the rest looked at them with pity.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon then waved her hand and a purple Mu Ning condensed in front of her. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't stop his eyebrows from rising at the sight of her purple power. Madam Moon truly was a legend in the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao, and her internal momentum was no doubt pure and powerful.</p>

  <p>As the purple power gradually condensed, it slowly morphed into a thorny purple vine.</p>

  <p>"Please have mercy on us, Madam Moon!"</p>

  <p>"We will strive to perform better next month!"</p>

  <p>"Please!"</p>

  <p>The three girls sobbed as they begged for mercy.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon didn't budge at all. She waved her hands and the purple vine shot out, filling the room with sharp crisp sounds reminiscent of a hail storm.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Madam Moon had cracked the vine whip hundreds of times!</p>

  <p>The girls' clothes were ripped to shreds and their bodies were covered in thick red blood. Save for their faces, every inch of their flesh was mangled and torn to pieces.</p>
