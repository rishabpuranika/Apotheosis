  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing the expression on Iris' face, Tianming couldn't help holding her hand tightly.</p>

  <p>After Nicholas had been defeated, the Dongfang Clan was bound to be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>Tianming was able to clear his mind.</p>

  <p>As far as he was aware, the Luo Clan had a deep grudge against the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, Zheng didn't bring about any turmoil on the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island for his mother's sake.</p>

  <p>It was inappropriate for Zheng to deal with these matters by himself. After Mike came out of the Evolutionary Universe, he might take action.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, those who were able to become the Holy Beings had always been ambitious, powerful and decisive. That meant that Mike, who was one of them, might not be soft-hearted.</p>

  <p>Now, Samuel might do such things even before he came back.</p>

  <p>Soon, after they left the space channel, the main door of the Swirl Forest finally welcomed their arrival.</p>

  <p>Being a regular visitor of the Swirl Forest, Zheng had never entered from the front gate. Making a detour and passing through the Dongfang Clan's transmission array this time, they were able to get to the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>After the Swirl Forest was controlled by Augustus, the other wealthy clans rarely explored it. Thick weeds and vines ran from one direction to the other, covering its gate now.</p>

  <p>In the fairy palace, Augustus was able to see their arrival. A confused expression suddenly took over him.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong now?" Hallet asked him flatly.</p>

  <p>"Zheng didn't use the token. He just came back from a Floating Island through a transmission array. He returns with a group of people this time," Augustus uttered curiously, not meeting Hallet's eyes.</p>

  <p>"What?" Surprised, Hallet's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Even though they had been worried about Zheng's safety these past few days, nobody said anything about it.</p>

  <p>Finally hearing about Zheng's return, Hallet naturally got excited and asked,</p>

  <p>"Do you know who are with him?"</p>

  <p>"I've never even seen those people," Augustus answered, curling his lip.</p>

  <p>"Wait, one of them looks familiar. It's the guy who fled to the Abyss Demon Region from the Luo Clan back then."</p>

  <p>"Send Harold, Joy and the others here. And bring these people to the fairy palace," Hallet ordered.</p>

  <p>Grinning, Augustus stretched out his finger to gently point at the Swirl Forest's entrance.</p>

  <p>It created an invisible wave which then turned into a straight line and spread forward rapidly.</p>

  <p>All the plants that grew on that straight line, including the towering trees and the weeds, then tilted to both sides, making room for a path which extended to where Zheng and the rest were standing.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Sword Chen still looked hesitant seeing the plants being cleared for them. On the other hand, Zheng couldn't help laughing. "Looks like Gus is welcoming us. He even makes a path for us."</p>

  <p>Having an open and convenient path, they were able to fly through it quickly.</p>

  <p>Soon, they reached the gate of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Joy, Harold and the others were also waiting at the gate of the fairy palace. Margaret and Yudie were also excited to see who the visitors were.</p>

  <p>Learning from Augustus that Zheng also brought a woman back, Joy got a bit surprised, wondering who the woman would be. Augustus even exaggerated the woman's beauty, saying that she was extremely gorgeous and one of the most beautiful women in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Yudie's and Margaret's faces lit up with hope earlier as Zheng had returned, but now they began to get morose after hearing what Augustus said.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng and the others arrive, Joy immediately became nervous.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you? Wow, Zheng is really amazing!" Augustus commented.</p>

  <p>Most of the women seemed a bit stunned as they observed the newcomers, but their gazes all fell on Lorena eventually. Entertaining all kinds of thoughts, they started to guess Lorena's identity.</p>

  <p>Since everyone was so busy, Harold got the chance to greet Lorena first.</p>

  <p>"She's my master's wife!" he exclaimed, bowing his head heavily towards Lorena.</p>

  <p>"Um?" In the beginning, Augustus was hoping to make fun of Zheng, but after he heard Harold, his face was filled with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Confused, Yudie, Margaret and the others exchanged glances among each other. Who would have known that the woman they thought as Zheng's lover was apparently his mother, their mother-in-law.</p>

  <p>Walking towards Harold, Lorena helped him up as she gave him a complicated look. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>Harold smiled shyly. "No worries. As long as I can help Master and you live safely, I'm willing to try my best."</p>

  <p>Turning around, Harold said something through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, another figure rushed out of the room. It was none other than Yan.</p>

  <p>Gazing at her brother blankly for a moment, she then threw herself into Lorena.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the fairy palace was wondering why Zheng could bring back Lorena this time, but none of them was brave enough to drop the question.</p>

  <p>Having mixed emotions, Lorena held Yan in her arms.</p>

  <p>To date, this was the second time that she had met her daughter. She had happened to encounter both her son and daughter in the debate venue, but now they formally met each other for the first time.</p>

  <p>Harold heavily patted on the shoulder of Sword Chen while he watched Lorena and her daughter from afar.</p>

  <p>"Harold!" The voice sounded with much excitement from Sword Chen who finally saw Harold again.</p>

  <p>As Mike's disciple, Sword Chen had stayed on the Floating Island of the Luo Clan for a very short time. And after he left for the Abyss Demon Region, no one had heard any news about him.</p>

  <p>Harold once thought that Sword Chen died already. After all, even a Holy Being couldn't ensure their survival in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"I haven't expected that you would be able to return from the Abyss Demon Region one day." Harold sighed.</p>

  <p>"I owe it all to Zheng," answered Sword Chen, pointing at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Surprised, Harold commented, "It seems that when Zheng was out this time, he entered the Abyss Demon Region because of the Stone Mouse, right?"</p>

  <p>Harold couldn't help worrying about Zheng during that period.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how he guessed, he wouldn't have thought that the Stone Mouse would lead Zheng into the Abyss Demon Region. That was not even a coincidence but purely bad luck. He couldn't understand how Zheng had been through all these terrible situations and managed to turn the tables in the end.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Sword Chen nodded.</p>

  <p>He appeared to be excited to tell Harold what had happened during this period of time. However, before he could say anything, Harold gestured for him to "keep quiet". "Why don't we talk about how you survived in the Abyss Demon Region during those years? How did you cultivate yourself to be a Demi-holy Being?"</p>

  <p>Right now, Sword Chen's cultivation base was higher than that of Harold.</p>

  <p>Harold was confused about this point.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng came back with Lorena, making Margaret, Yudie and the other women feel bashful and embarrassed. Unsure on how to deal with the situation, they tried to behave themselves.</p>

  <p>Still holding Yan in her arms, Lorena keenly perceived the emotions of everyone in the place. "Zheng, are you ready to introduce your wives to me?" she asked, turning to Zheng with a playful smile. She blinked at him to make him feel at ease.</p>

  <p>Smiling, Zheng nodded and suggested, "Let's go inside first."</p>

  <p>They all went together inside the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>While they made their way inside the palace, Joy and Lorena exchanged glances but no one spoke a word.</p>

  <p>Everyone else were too busy to even notice it, except for Harold who forced a bitter smile as he went along.</p>
