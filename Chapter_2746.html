<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fiends that were guarding the pasture had little else to do.</p>

  <p>They always made sure that the ferocious beasts weren't able to escape the pasture. They also needed to capture enough fresh food and handed it over when they were ordered to.</p>

  <p>The strange fish was already familiar with the fiend race as it had been in the presence of this race for countless years past.</p>

  <p>At the same time that Nicholas led an army of Holy Beings into the Abyss Demon Region, the fiends had also begun to send their own members.</p>

  <p>There were originally twelve fiends who were stationed at the pasture.</p>

  <p>When eight of them were dispatched to the other stages, only four fiends remained to guard this place.</p>

  <p>"Here I go! Let me see how you plan to escape!"</p>

  <p>Inside a room at the top of the building, two fiends faced each other on opposite sides of a big board. Both of them looked excited as they played the game of Go.</p>

  <p>The game of Go was complicated, but the fiends' intelligence level allowed them to keep up with the game-play.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the fiends had unparalleled skills that they had mastered in playing Go. They were very proficient at playing Go and they were very fond of playing it.</p>

  <p>One of the fiends had thought about his move for a long time before he finally moved a piece on the board.</p>

  <p>"You made a mistake, idiot!" a fiend beside him, who was watching the game, sneered.</p>

  <p>The fiend who played his move in the game glared murderously at the fiend who mocked him, then said, "There exists a saying among True Gods: A true gentleman keeps his silence while watching a game..."</p>

  <p>Before he finished his statement, his eyes glanced towards the door. A smile was slyly revealed on his face. "Haha, it seems that we would be eating something scrumptious today!"</p>

  <p>The other fiends directed their gaze to the same direction he was looking at; they also caught sight of the strange fish outside the house!</p>

  <p>In the divine land, there was a legend passed down from generation to generation about the strange fish.</p>

  <p>In the legend, it had been described as being extremely delicious. Many True Gods in the divine land who believed in the legend wanted to capture the strange fish in the northern sea.</p>

  <p>Because of this legend, the strange fish came into existence in the Abyss Demon Region and became a delicacy for the fiends.</p>

  <p>However, this delicacy wasn't enjoyed by just any random fiend. Only the powerful fiends had been offered with this strange fish for them to partake of. Ordinary fiends had only dreamt of having a share.</p>

  <p>But an opportunity had presented itself at that moment!</p>

  <p>When the other three fiends caught sight of the strange fish, greed was very evident in the way they looked at it hungrily.</p>

  <p>"This guy arrived just in time; it must have heard something from the dining table. Otherwise, it wouldn't have planned to escape now!" A fiend smirked.</p>

  <p>Each of the four fiends glanced at the others, then quickly rushed out of the building hoping to get to the strange fish first.</p>

  <p>The strange fish was swaggering. Not the slightest fear was evident upon its expression or movements even when the fiends pounced on it.</p>

  <p>It stepped backward a few times and a bit to the right, so it became easier for Luo Zheng and Leland to make their move!</p>

  <p>"Huh, it's my turn to taste it," the fiend who was running in the lead shouted.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap! Haven't you tasted it when the strange fish tried to escape two divine eras ago? I have never taken a bite!" the fiend who was in second place shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>"It belongs to whoever catches it first!" said another fiend.</p>

  <p>The fiend who was in the last place said nothing, in apparent agreement of the said rule.</p>

  <p>As their group gradually got closer and closer to the strange fish, the fish also increased its speed and gravitated towards the low-lying area on one side.</p>

  <p>"Hey, men... Can I have a word with all of you?" the strange fish spoke suddenly after having retreated for a bit of distance.</p>

  <p>However, the fiends were like ravenous wolves that just came down from the mountain. Who in their right minds would talk nonsense with their food? Besides, they needed to compete with each other to see who could get the chance to eat this food.</p>

  <p>When it realized that the fiends wouldn't be stopped in their tracks, the strange fish's eyes finally showed a hint of surprise and a bit of fear. It shouted, "Why don't you make your move?!"</p>

  <p>If the fish was really devoured by the fiends, then this would be the end of the fish's adventure. Naturally, the fish would have done anything to prevent that from happening.</p>

  <p>Because of its exclamation, strange expressions appeared in the eyes of the four fiends.</p>

  <p>Did this strange fish call out to someone who would help it?</p>

  <p>Were the beasts in the pasture planning an uprising against the fiends?</p>

  <p>As the fiends were wondering about these things, two figures suddenly attacked from the low-lying area!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The long sword in Luo Zheng's grasp gleamed a bright silver as it swung in a great arc.</p>

  <p>During Luo Zheng and Edmond's last encounter, Luo Zheng had barely held his ground.</p>

  <p>The magnitude of the fiend's strength had left a distinct impression on him.</p>

  <p>This time, he was the one who initiated the attack. He poured all this strength and did not hold back!</p>

  <p>"Hu...Human?"</p>

  <p>The front-most fiend was surprised and dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The fiends had an extensive imagination but never did it enter their expectations that a True God of the human race would show himself in front of them...</p>

  <p>However, his shock was short-lived. The gleaming silver sword flashed momentarily as it arced towards the fiend's neck, before the huge head toppled down from his torso.</p>

  <p>As he made his move simultaneously, Leland was secretly astonished at the way Luo Zheng struck his opponent.</p>

  <p>He concluded that he wouldn't have been able to resist that sword attack even if he had transformed into the Divine Five Elements Body!</p>

  <p>However, this wasn't the time to admire Luo Zheng's abilities. Leland quickly extended his arm and a powerful stream of the five elements internal momentum spread out.</p>

  <p>"Five Elements Subdue!"</p>

  <p>Not to be outdone by Luo Zheng, Leland also went all-out in his attack.</p>

  <p>A colorful beam of light suddenly shone down from the sky. Under this beam of light, an intense pressure bore down on an area of several ten thousand feet around.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Everyone in this area had to bear great pressure.</p>

  <p>The ground suddenly cracked and immediately turned into dust...</p>

  <p>Even the fiends were affected by the great pressure and were unable to escape from the colorful light's effects.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't waste such a good chance to finish off all of them.</p>

  <p>With a quick somersault, he slashed out suddenly with his long sword.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh</p>

  <p>Three bright rays of radiance from the silver sword shot towards the fiends' faces, catching them unaware.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance went through the heads of two of the fiends who failed to dodge it; it killed them instantly.</p>

  <p>The last fiend, however, had quick reflexes and managed to dodge the sword radiance beam. Even under the pressure exerted by the five colored light, he still avoided Luo Zheng's sword and retreated rapidly!</p>

  <p>"Damn human!" the fiend cursed at him and raised his arm in a fist.</p>

  <p>On his arm was a tiny and exquisite skull.</p>

  <p>"Stop him! He's going to call for reinforcements of the other fiends!" the strange fish raised its voice in a roar and shouted loudly. As it had hidden in the low-lying area, it saw everything that went on.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng froze in concentration, then thunder wings instantly materialized on his back!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>With a crisp crack of lightning, Luo Zheng suddenly appeared at the fiend's side.</p>

  <p>He slashed his sword downwards directly onto the fiend's head.</p>

  <p>But it was too late. The tiny skull on the fiend's arm had already lit up and glowed with a malicious light. The fiend roared, "Pasture, humans..."</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng struck the fiend's head with his long sword and almost split the fiend into two.</p>

  <p>After he dealt the killing blow, Luo Zheng drew his sword and quickly thrust it at the skull.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword pierced the core of the skull and immediately tore it into pieces.</p>

  <p>With the combined power of Luo Zheng and Leland, they had eliminated all four fiends without hassle. They had finished the job quickly and cleanly.</p>

  <p>However, their faces had unreadable expressions. The last fiend had already sent out the call for reinforcement!</p>

  <p>"We need to get out of this place as soon as possible. It will still take some time for the other fiends to get here!"</p>

  <p>The strange fish felt excitement running through its veins. It did not expect that the two humans were such powerful beings. This might really be an opportunity for it to escape alive!</p>
