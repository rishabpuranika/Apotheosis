  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's body, strengthened by the ancestry-level bloodline, displayed an astonishing explosive power!</p>

  <p>As each punch landed on Hawley's body, power waves burst in all directions while the Flaming Maple Trees that surrounded them swayed crazily.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>The warriors from various races and the Eternal Realm warriors all hid behind the Flaming Maple Trees as they watched the battle. They were all shocked at the sight of the intense battle.</p>

  <p>"The power of this tall human is so terrifying!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Wheeler was right in his judgment. This human is stronger than him."</p>

  <p>"But no matter how powerful this person is, he still cannot hurt Hawley..." they talked among themselves.</p>

  <p>During the long time that the Misty River race had controlled the Flaming Maple Forest, many races wanted to eradicate them and had devised various plans.</p>

  <p>The most powerful ones among them were naturally the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Because of their unique form, the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't enter the Flaming Maple Forest to fight. However, with a huge amount of resources of the Three Purities Stage in their hands, they were capable of using special methods.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, the Element Spirit Civilization created a powerful Dark Blood Puppet. This puppet was personally created by the Eye Spirit consuming a lot of precious resources of the Element Spirit Civilization. Its strength exceeded that of any ordinary member of the Misty River race.</p>

  <p>However, Hawley had effortlessly smashed it into little pieces only in the first round of the fight.</p>

  <p>Since then, the Element Spirit Civilization realized that they should never try to attack the Misty River race in the Flaming Maple Forest ever again.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race had also made similar attempts. Because they knew Hawley was powerful and was the most difficult to deal with, they had targeted him from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven created a clone of himself and hid it in the Golden Body Pool of the Supreme Pure Realm. After a few years, the clone went to the Flaming Maple Forest alone to challenge Hawley.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race set up a more challenging contest with Hawley than the Element Spirit Civilization. The clone of the Grandmaster of Heaven relied on its excellent bodily movements and endured fighting for several rounds.</p>

  <p id="top_6">However, even though the clone was extremely fast, its attacking method was inefficient to break through Hawley's defense. In the end, only a single punch from Hawley brutally tore it straight into defeat.</p>

  <p>From then on, no one had foolishly dared to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Hawley usually defeated his opponents with one blow. Most of the warriors from the various races and the Eternal Realm warriors thought that there was no need for him to strike a second time to kill his opponent–but in his fight with Zheng, the unexpected occurred. Zheng had not only withstood Hawley's first blow but also possessed combat power to counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, such a counterattack was in vain.</p>

  <p>Hawley didn't dodge. Receiving the hits from Zheng's fist, he was forced to retreat. His legs plowed two ditches on the ground, but his face didn't change at all. There was evident mockery in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your body is tough yet your strength is too weak," Hawley said proudly, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the attack at this level was useless on Hawley, Zheng stopped and said, "Do you hear that? You are too weak."</p>

  <p>Zheng's words confused Hawley. Who was he talking to?</p>

  <p>Wasn't he alone?</p>

  <p>Of course he didn't know that Zheng was talking to the ancestry-level bloodline...</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng felt the blood in his body rolling like waves. The ancestry-level bloodline knew that energy could not be used in the Flaming Maple Forest, so it surged in a strange way to protest. It sent a special message to Zheng through its emotion–I could become stronger, it seemed to declare.</p>

  <p>The emotion was inexpressible in words, but Zheng deciphered it.</p>

  <p>"Since you admit that you are weak, you must also understand the fate of the weak," Hawley said as he opened his arms.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I understand," replied Zheng, "but you have to wait for a moment." He smiled teasingly.</p>

  <p>Zheng began to chant the Illusion Breaking Rune. This triggered the attack of Flaming Maple Forest, causing several maple leaves to light up and shoot towards him; but as soon as he finished speaking, his body suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Just as before, Zheng was gone before the maple leaves exploded.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin all joined in chanting the Illusion Breaking Rune and instantly escaped from the Other Shore. Their action caused a more violent response from the maple leaves.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Some of the maple leaves exploded in front of Hawley but he didn't move, remaining unafraid of them.</p>

  <p>"Wait for a moment?" murmured Hawley.</p>

  <p>"He must have run away! They can't escape. I'll find a member of the Gear race and drag them back here!" exclaimed Abner as he came forward.</p>

  <p>Norris was a member of the Gear race, and pulling the creatures from the chaos back to the Other Shore was one of their theurgies. Moreover, similar theurgies on the Three Purities Stage were not exclusive to the members of the Gear race. It was easy for the Element Spirit Civilization to seek help from others.</p>

  <p>"He asked me to wait for him. He will be back," Hawley said coldly as he looked at Abner.</p>

  <p>"Master Hawley, these rats will definitely hide in the chaos and dare not to return. I will drag them back before their shadows disappear..."</p>

  <p>Hawley threw Abner a deadly look before he could finish his words.</p>

  <p>Abner didn't dare continue, his legs trembling as he took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>When he retreated to Wheeler's side, Wheeler sneered, "If you have said one more word, you wouldn't have had the chance to stand here. Hawley doesn't need you to tell him what to do."</p>

  <p>Hawley stood there motionless. The atmosphere turned gloomy in the open space where the warriors of various races and Eternal Realm warriors gathered. At Hawley's presence, no one dared to look for treasures in the Divine River. Everyone waited by Wheeler's side.</p>

  <p>At the Pear Hill...</p>

  <p>The faces of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yasamin, and the Eastern Emperor Taiyi had darkened after they returned to the Source World.</p>

  <p>Having learned from previous experience, they were aware that even if they returned to the chaos, they still wouldn't be safe.</p>

  <p>The four of them looked at Zheng. He looked at his body and warned them,</p>

  <p>"Everyone, take a step back..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's belly suddenly swelled into the shape of a large ball.</p>

  <p>The temperature in his huge belly increased rapidly, almost like that of a furnace...</p>

  <p>Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who was standing slightly further, could only retreat as the heat became unbearable. The Snake Goddess approached the Holy Soul Realm warriors around them. She quickly dispersed the warriors and led them out of the palace.</p>

  <p>Not long after they retreated, the palace walls collapsed because of the extreme temperature.</p>

  <p>A small dazzling sun rose from the ruins of the palace, and at the center of the sun was a black dot.</p>

  <p>"Is there... a freak in Zheng's belly?" Feng Ge looked at the scene from a distance.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what's in there, but it must be something that can make him stronger..." Eastern Emperor Taiyi replied, also shocked by the odd sight.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess looked very serious.</p>

  <p>They had seen Zheng strengthen his body many times. He had completely changed out of human form after several transformations, so they were calmer than the others upon witnessing such a scene.</p>

  <p>This time, it seemed difficult to deal with Hawley as Zheng had made a greater move to strengthen his body.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Floating in the air, Zheng felt that the ancestry-level bloodline in his body was consistently flowing towards his stomach. He stared at the black dot in confusion. 'Is this a pill?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng faintly understood that Hawley was very powerful. If the ancestry-level bloodline wanted to continue strengthening his body, it was to use more complicated methods.</p>

  <p>However, the thought of nurturing a pill in his belly while everyone gazed still left Zheng speechless.</p>
