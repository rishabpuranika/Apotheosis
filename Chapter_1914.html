<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the man slowly reached out his hand to grab Luo Zheng, it seemed all paths of retreat for Luo Zheng were sealed off. The man's expression was apathetic yet it gave Luo Zheng an immense amount of pressure. There was no room for Luo Zheng to evade the man's approach.</p>

  <p>The nine stars in Zheng's inner world continuously transformed chaotic energy. However, the amount of chaotic energy in his inner world was limited as well. If he absorbed too much chaotic energy at once, his inner world might dry up and crumble.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already guessed that the person in front of him was sent here by Holy Jay. However, he didn't know anything about this arrangement.</p>

  <p>When the person finally grabbed him, Luo Zheng suddenly twisted his body violently to break free.</p>

  <p>The person seized Zheng's shoulder and was able to suppress Luo Zheng by sheer force. Frustration painted Zheng's face as he remained a captive of the man.</p>

  <p>With the man's unparalleled strength, Luo Zheng was lifted above the man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Whether it was brute strength or the mastery of techniques that used sheer force, Luo Zheng was far inferior to the person who captured him.</p>

  <p>With a fierce Mu Ning, the person strode forward and carried Luo Zheng on one shoulder and the golden hammer on the other shoulder. He walked with a dignified and powerful atmosphere as if he couldn't be bothered by anything or anyone in his path. The others who saw how Luo Zheng was captured followed Luo Zheng and his captor. However, their existence was completely ignored by the one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" Luo Zheng shouted with a harsh tone.</p>

  <p>Although he was already seized by the man, it didn't mean that Luo Zheng couldn't resist. Luo Zheng immediately thought about how he could escape his captor.</p>

  <p>"I advise you to be obedient. It's useless to resist. Do you really think you can escape from me?" the one-eyed man asked coldly. His tone was calm, yet carried a somewhat heavy pressure.</p>

  <p>Concentration flowed through Luo Zheng as the chaotic energy surged out of his body. After that, a circle of light quietly appeared under the feet of the one-eyed man. Luo Zheng wanted to use Thunderbolt Annihilation, but the Heavenly Tribulation brewed above their heads for quite some time already, yet no thunderbolts appeared to strike the man...</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man let out an imperious laugh as he raised his head and gave a supercilious glance at Luo Zheng. "There is no Heavenly Tribulation within the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The Thunderbolt Annihilation naturally cannot be summoned. I already told you that all the struggle would be useless."</p>

  <p>Disappointment and shock painted Zheng's face when he heard the one-eyed man's remark. The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land wasn't a complete universe. Some cultivation methods were indeed useless here.</p>

  <p>He remembered that the Stellar Body couldn't be used in this place, either.</p>

  <p>However, just as the one-eyed man finished his words, a stream of chaotic energy instantly turned into a bunch of extremely beautiful ice flowers.</p>

  <p>This was the Ice Soul Flame that Luo Zheng comprehended not long ago!</p>

  <p>Beautiful ice flowers danced in the air and floated toward the one-eyed man. The one-eyed man readied himself to defend, but the ice flowers immediately released powerful cold air.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man ran at an extremely fast speed. However, the moment the Ice Soul Flame appeared, his speed decreased drastically as if he had sunk into quicksand…</p>

  <p>"Ice Soul Flame?" said the one-eyed man with a curious expression on his face. The one-eyed man was surprised that Luo Zheng was able to master the theurgy of Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>The power of the Ice Soul Flame that was activated with chaotic energy was not something to be underestimated. The one-eyed man had been careless and the cold flame poison from the Ice Soul Flame invaded his body. At this moment, it was extremely difficult for him to move.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's cultivation was still comparatively too low. If Luo Zheng used this technique on a martial artist of the same level as him, or even a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior or a world lord, the effect would naturally be extraordinary. Regretfully, at Zheng's current level of cultivation, an attack like this couldn't do any harm to the one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>A circle of light flashed through the one-eyed man's body as waves of water vapor were forced to exit his physique. After a while, the previously sluggish body of the one-eyed man returned to normal.</p>

  <p>At that moment, even if Luo Zheng used the Ice Soul Flame once more, the cold flame poison in the flame wouldn't be able to enter the one-eyed man's body.</p>

  <p>However, the one-eyed man didn't want Luo Zheng to cause any more trouble or delay. It didn't take him much concentration to condense a faint circle of light as he immediately struck it towards Zheng's abdomen. After the one-eyed man removed his hand, a spider condensed by light was seen left on Zheng's abdomen.</p>

  <p>The spider was very lifelike. Its eight legs extended out of its body as it lay on Zheng's stomach. Then, the spider's legs easily pierced through Zheng's lower abdomen and wrapped around Zheng's cinnabar field. Luo Zheng instantly felt as if his connection with his inner world was severed!</p>

  <p>"Relax, it's only a sealing technique. Your inner world should be similar to the universe built by a Holy Being, and it has the Cross-world Theurgy. I temporarily modified this technique. However, I advise you not to make any move. If it actually cuts your connection with your inner world, I will feel very guilty," the one-eyed man said blandly.</p>

  <p>Without the ability to use his inner world, Luo Zheng had no choice but to obey the one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>Aside from his superior strength and technique, the one-eyed man also understood Luo Zheng very well. He was even aware that Zheng's inner world was different from that of an ordinary warrior. The one-eyed man's unimaginable power and intellect made Luo Zheng hard to resist or escape.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng felt relieved even though he was captured. Although the one-eyed man didn't look like a good person, he did not murder anyone when he captured Luo Zheng. Additionally, he knew Luo Zheng very well and even Zheng's inner world construction. Luo Zheng guessed that the one-eyed man might be someone under the employ of Holy Jay. However, he still couldn't figure out what his purpose of abducting him was.</p>
