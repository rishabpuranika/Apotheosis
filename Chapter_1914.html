<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1914 Holy Drew (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the man slowly reached out his hand to grab Luo Luo Zheng, it seemed all paths of retreat for Luo Luo Zheng were sealed off. The man's expression was apathetic yet it gave Luo Luo Zheng an immense amount of pressure. There was no room for Luo Luo Zheng to evade the man's approach.</p>

  <p>The nine stars in Luo Zheng's inner world continuously transformed chaotic energy. However, the amount of chaotic energy in his inner world was limited as well. If he absorbed too much chaotic energy at once, his inner world might dry up and crumble.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already guessed that the person in front of him was sent here by Holy Jay. However, he didn't know anything about this arrangement.</p>

  <p>When the person finally grabbed him, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly twisted his body violently to break free.</p>

  <p>The person seized Luo Zheng's shoulder and was able to suppress Luo Luo Zheng by sheer force. Frustration painted Luo Zheng's face as he remained a captive of the man.</p>

  <p>With the man's unparalleled strength, Luo Luo Zheng was lifted above the man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Whether it was brute strength or the mastery of techniques that used sheer force, Luo Luo Zheng was far inferior to the person who captured him.</p>

  <p>With a fierce Mu Ning, the person strode forward and carried Luo Luo Zheng on one shoulder and the golden hammer on the other shoulder. He walked with a dignified and powerful atmosphere as if he couldn't be bothered by anything or anyone in his path. The others who saw how Luo Luo Zheng was captured followed Luo Luo Zheng and his captor. However, their existence was completely ignored by the one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" Luo Luo Zheng shouted with a harsh tone.</p>

  <p>Although he was already seized by the man, it didn't mean that Luo Luo Zheng couldn't resist. Luo Luo Zheng immediately thought about how he could escape his captor.</p>

  <p>"I advise you to be obedient. It's useless to resist. Do you really think you can escape from me?" the one-eyed man asked coldly. His tone was calm, yet carried a somewhat heavy pressure.</p>

  <p>Concentration flowed through Luo Luo Zheng as the chaotic energy surged out of his body. After that, a circle of light quietly appeared under the feet of the one-eyed man. Luo Luo Zheng wanted to use Thunderbolt Annihilation, but the Heavenly Tribulation brewed above their heads for quite some time already, yet no thunderbolts appeared to strike the man...</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man let out an imperious laugh as he raised his head and gave a supercilious glance at Luo Luo Zheng. "There is no Heavenly Tribulation within the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The Thunderbolt Annihilation naturally cannot be summoned. I already told you that all the struggle would be useless."</p>

  <p>Disappointment and shock painted Luo Zheng's face when he heard the one-eyed man's remark. The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land wasn't a complete universe. Some cultivation methods were indeed useless here.</p>

  <p>He remembered that the Stellar Body couldn't be used in this place, either.</p>

  <p>However, just as the one-eyed man finished his words, a stream of chaotic energy instantly turned into a bunch of extremely beautiful ice flowers.</p>

  <p>This was the Ice Soul Flame that Luo Luo Zheng comprehended not long ago!</p>

  <p>Beautiful ice flowers danced in the air and floated toward the one-eyed man. The one-eyed man readied himself to defend, but the ice flowers immediately released powerful cold air.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man ran at an extremely fast speed. However, the moment the Ice Soul Flame appeared, his speed decreased drastically as if he had sunk into quicksand?</p>

  <p>"Ice Soul Flame?" said the one-eyed man with a curious expression on his face. The one-eyed man was surprised that Luo Luo Zheng was able to master the token of Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>The power of the Ice Soul Flame that was activated with chaotic energy was not something to be underestimated. The one-eyed man had been careless and the cold flame poison from the Ice Soul Flame invaded his body. At this moment, it was extremely difficult for him to move.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's cultivation was still comparatively too low. If Luo Luo Zheng used this technique on a martial artist of the same level as him, or even a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior or a world lord, the effect would naturally be extraordinary. Regretfully, at Luo Zheng's current level of cultivation, an attack like this couldn't do any harm to the one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>A circle of light flashed through the one-eyed man's body as waves of water vapor were forced to exit his physique. After a while, the previously sluggish body of the one-eyed man returned to normal.</p>

  <p>At that moment, even if Luo Luo Zheng used the Ice Soul Flame once more, the cold flame poison in the flame wouldn't be able to enter the one-eyed man's body.</p>

  <p>However, the one-eyed man didn't want Luo Luo Zheng to cause any more trouble or delay. It didn't take him much concentration to condense a faint circle of light as he immediately struck it towards Luo Zheng's abdomen. After the one-eyed man removed his hand, a spider condensed by light was seen left on Luo Zheng's abdomen.</p>

  <p>The spider was very lifelike. Its eight legs extended out of its body as it lay on Luo Zheng's stomach. Then, the spider's legs easily pierced through Luo Zheng's lower abdomen and wrapped around Luo Zheng's cinnabar field. Luo Luo Zheng instantly felt as if his connection with his inner world was severed!</p>

  <p>"Relax, it's only a sealing technique. Your inner world should be similar to the universe built by a Holy Being, and it has the Cross-world token. I temporarily modified this technique. However, I advise you not to make any move. If it actually cuts your connection with your inner world, I will feel very guilty," the one-eyed man said blandly.</p>

  <p>Without the ability to use his inner world, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to obey the one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>Aside from his superior strength and technique, the one-eyed man also understood Luo Luo Zheng very well. He was even aware that Luo Zheng's inner world was different from that of an ordinary warrior. The one-eyed man's unimaginable power and intellect made Luo Luo Zheng hard to resist or escape.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng felt relieved even though he was captured. Although the one-eyed man didn't look like a good person, he did not murder anyone when he captured Luo Luo Zheng. Additionally, he knew Luo Luo Zheng very well and even Luo Zheng's inner world construction. Luo Luo Zheng guessed that the one-eyed man might be someone under the employ of Holy Jay. However, he still couldn't figure out what his purpose of abducting him was.</p>
