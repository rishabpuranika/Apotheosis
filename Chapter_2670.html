<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2670 Luo Zheng's Request </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the vast chaos, one could see everything that was happening.</p>

  <p>They looked at the distance as if they were stargazing. The view was as far as it could get.</p>

  <p>Emily looked at it for a while as she said flatly, "Maybe it's the plankton within the chaos. They are too far away from us. We shouldn't mind them at all."</p>

  <p>Even with their unparalleled flying speed, it would still take several years for them to reach the black dots.</p>

  <p>"Are there also living creatures within the chaos?" Luo Zheng asked, taking the opportunity to know more about the subject.</p>

  <p>"Of course. The chaos may seem empty but that is only because of its ridiculous size. There are actually many creatures living inside it!" Emily said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the light dots that flew in the far distance as he also looked at the boundless brown Chaotic Clouds. The expression on his face made it seem as if he was lost in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>His master went inside the chaos a few years ago and they had never heard of him since. He wondered whether his master would be powerful enough to protect himself from the powerful creatures within the chaos.</p>

  <p>But then again, maybe his master already returned to the divine land while he was away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but get anxious as he thought of it. He didn't know how everything was doing in the Immortal Mansion since he hadn't been around for so long. What worried him the most was his mother and all he wished for was her safety.</p>

  <p>As he was thinking about all of it, he followed Emily and the others in approaching the giant bumps.</p>

  <p>Some of the exiles didn't hesitate too much and immediately used their theurgies again as they hoped to break through the outer wall of the divine land. If they succeeded, they would be able to enter the divine land through the universes.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, their efforts didn't pay off and the Heavenly Mirror Shield was still there!</p>

  <p>After their attempt failed, Leopold concluded, "I don't think the Heavenly Mirror Shield is something we can break. If we continue to rely on brute force, I'm afraid we won't be able to enter the divine land at all!"</p>

  <p>"If even you can't enter the divine land, then it would be impossible for the Yellow Emperor Guards to enter," Luo Zheng said with a disappointed tone.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Timotheus narrowed his eyes as he said in a serious tone,</p>

  <p>"What if the Yellow Emperor Guards are actually stronger than us?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe, but I highly doubt it," Luo Zheng said as he blinked his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You do have great confidence in us," Emily said with a faint smile. "If we still fail to break the Heavenly Mirror Shield, I'm afraid there's only one other way. You might say it's a stupid way, but I can assure you that we will be able to enter the divine land. I think... The Yellow Emperor Guards actually used the same method to enter the divine land back then!"</p>

  <p>A look of suspicion appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he heard her words.</p>

  <p>Ramzi's eyes flashed as he said, "You mean we're going to break through the space barrier?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus also nodded, "The space barrier around the divine land is quite thick. It might take us a long time to break through it."</p>

  <p>"How long are we talking about?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Maybe about half a year? Two years? Maybe even five... It's difficult to say how long it will take. After all, the space barrier was set up by Chiyou and could only be broken bit by bit. This method may be quite inefficient but is undoubtedly effective," Emily replied.</p>

  <p>"I don't have that much time. I don't know if my mother is safe as we speak. There are too many variables in those years!" Luo Zheng shook his head as his face was filled with disappointment.</p>

  <p>They were so close to getting in the divine land but he learnt that it would take them a few more years to get inside. It was quite difficult for him to accept it.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Ramzi, Leopold, and the other Nine Li members bowed their heads in silence.</p>

  <p>They had a different stance from the Snake Goddess race being led by Emily.</p>

  <p>Emily helped Luo Zheng in returning the favor of helping them escape the world they were trapped in, while it was an obligation for Timotheus and the others from the Nine Li race to help Luo Zheng as much as they could.</p>

  <p>They also knew that Luo Zheng's mother, Lorena, was the daughter of the Grand Chieftain and the princess of their Nine Li race!</p>

  <p>Looking at the faces of Timotheus and the rest of the Nine Li members, Luo Zheng realized that his tone might have been a bit too harsh. They were probably more anxious than he was.</p>

  <p>It made no sense to blame them the way he did.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a while and said, "Since the space barrier is preventing you from entering, how about you let me in first?"</p>

  <p>Emily had said before that the people who were born in the divine land could come and go freely without being blocked by the space barrier.</p>

  <p>This was true as Luo Zheng and some Holy Beings had done it themselves before.</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be difficult to send you in," Ramzi said with a worried expression on his face. "But I'm afraid that with your current strength, you might have trouble handling the Yellow Emperor Guards!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Perhaps it would be a terrible idea to let you in alone," added Leopold.</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded and said, "No way we'll let you enter by yourself!"</p>

  <p>They were still worried about Luo Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>After entering the divine land, Luo Zheng had to face the consummate True Gods, the Holy Beings, and some powerful masters of the Other Shore Realm!</p>

  <p>In their heads, letting Luo Zheng enter by himself was a death wish. They surely would not agree.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pursed his lips as he took a deep breath. He then said slowly, "My father mainly cultivates the Evolution Divine Dao. He has been plotting for many years his revenge against the Holy Beings and the Yellow Emperor Guards. If calculated by the time of the universe, he spent a total of thirty to forty billion years on the plan, which was equivalent to more than ten grand eras.</p>

  <p>You're not part of my father's plan," Luo Zheng continued as he gazed at them with his determined eyes. "I choose to believe my father."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words were very straightforward.</p>

  <p>In Mike's plan to fight Nicholas and the Yellow Emperor Guards, the exiles who were at the bottom of the chaos were not included.</p>

  <p>Even without them, Luo Zheng still had faith in his father's arrangement and strategy!</p>

  <p>Timotheus and Leopold discreetly exchanged glances with each other.</p>

  <p>In their opinion, no matter what happened in the divine land, as long as they could enter the divine land, they could exterminate anyone and put an end to everything!</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was too important and they had no plans of letting him die before his time.</p>

  <p>So Timotheus and his companions were committed to controlling Luo Zheng first and releasing him once they were done with everything.</p>

  <p>While they were hesitating, Emily walked towards Luo Zheng. With a light tap of her slender finger, a small oil lamp appeared.</p>

  <p>After she swayed the oil lamp in front of Luo Zheng's forehead, he immediately felt a mysterious connection to the little oil lamp. A faint green light then appeared inside the oil lamp.</p>

  <p>"This is your Life Lamp. If you die, the light inside your Life Lamp will be extinguished and we will know about it immediately," Emily said softly. "I will help you enter the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Emily!"</p>

  <p>"Master Emily!"</p>

  <p>"You know how important Luo Zheng is to our Nine Li race!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus and Ramzi both had indignant expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>They thought that Emily was pushing Luo Zheng into a fire pit.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am fully aware." Emily turned around and smiled. "But don't forget that this is Luo Zheng's own decision. If he really is the hope of the Nine Li race, then you should choose to believe in him or the Nine Li race would lose all their hope!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus and his companions couldn't say anything in return.</p>

  <p>If they were to think that the Nine Li race could rise again, it wouldn't be enough to simply rely on the Other Shore Realm warriors like Timotheus and the few others.</p>

  <p>The most important thing was for Luo Zheng to grow up. It was indeed meaningless to protect him at all times.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Timotheus and others did not speak at all, Emily's beautiful eyes flashed as she pointed downwards. An immense force of space spread out to form a round space channel in front of Emily.</p>

  <p>This space channel stretched over millions of miles. It passed through a universe and was able to reach the internal space of the divine land.</p>

  <p>While she was building the space channel, on a Floating Island above the Time Sea, Murphy was sitting on the lotus throne and was recuperating with his eyes closed. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and shock was written all over his face. "Who is that? Who dares to break through my universe and disturb me?"</p>
