  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment a square stone pressed down, Luo Zheng's face was full of calmness as a white mist rose from his body.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's body turned as light as a feather.</p>

  <p>Although the rock was rolling incredibly quickly, it was extremely large.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Eight Smoky Melodies was a quite unique one? such was a movement technique that was like dancing on the tip of a blade.</p>

  <p>The faster and stronger the opponent was, the smoother Luo Zheng's body could move.</p>

  <p>Up until now, only the Crescent Blade under Lucille's feet had managed to break through the three-inch limit set by the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng confidently dodged the stone in front of him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Under everyone's watchful eyes, the stone came crashing down on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, his body moved strangely? he took steps horizontally, like a leave that had been 'squeezed out' after being disturbed by the palm wind.</p>

  <p>"What is this movement technique?" one of the others blurted out in confusion.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was out of danger, his figure floated down. But of course, he didn't have time to answer the question because two more square stones began pressing down on him.</p>

  <p>After the crowd rushed away from the exit of the hall, they once again began fighting with the rolling stones.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for saving my life," the warrior instantly thanked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, Luo Luo Zheng only shook his head. "We are going to venture through the Hall of Causality together. When necessary, we'll need to cooperate with each other and work together. Helping you also means helping myself."</p>

  <p>With this, the wariness among the ten of them was fortunately dispelled.</p>

  <p>Initially, some warriors had their own selfish thoughts, after all. If anyone was to be crushed by a giant stone, letting their Illusion Points burst out, then the others could naturally take advantage of such an opportunity. Now that they truly wanted to go further, they understood that teamwork became extremely important.</p>

  <p>"But with that white grating blocking our way, I wonder how we'll manage to pass?" someone said, already sounding depressed.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, be careful. There must be some sort of mechanism here." As everyone retreated, they discussed how to make an escape.</p>

  <p>At this time, the short human warrior from the Blessed Buddha Land suddenly offered, "Perhaps the mechanism is on these giant stones."</p>

  <p>With that, he turned around to avoid the giant square stone in front of him. Surprisingly, a short sword appeared in his hand? a supreme divine weapon, the Buddha Curse Blade!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His body flashed around the huge rock. While he wasn't able to fly in the hall, his speed just increased dramatically.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Curse Blade in his hand slashed lightly across the huge rock.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment the Buddha Curse Blade slashed down, a crisp sound rang out. A swastika mark then appeared on the stone's surface.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The short martial artist seized the opportunity to flash out when the stone came crashing down once again. Thrusting out the Buddha Curse Blade again, he left another swastika mark on it.</p>

  <p>After repeating this move a number of times, each side of the enormous rocks had a swastika mark on its surface.</p>

  <p>Then, the short warrior suddenly took a step back, holding the Buddha Curse Blade. Staring at the giant rock, he chanted, "One word breaks all directions. Shatter!"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The swastika marks on the surface of the square stone began spinning rapidly at the same time.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>An extremely strong force impacted the surface of the huge rock. In waves of the Buddhist light, countless sharp silhouettes shot straight at the huge rock's surface.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful technique!" Even Luo Zheng's face had turned solemn. This Buddha Curse Blade was also a supreme divine weapon, after all. It was different from the Black Star? because it was considered an offensive tool, it wasn't surprising that it had such overwhelming power.</p>

  <p>There was a Law of Causality within the supreme divine weapon? would this Buddha Curse Blade be able to shatter the huge stone?</p>

  <p>While dodging the stones' crushing attacks, everyone made sure to pay attention to the short warrior's moves.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>The huge rock actually stopped rolling.</p>

  <p>'Did he make it?'</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Luo Zheng thought as his gaze froze. When the light dissipated, he saw that the huge rock was left completely undamaged. Meanwhile, a small grimace appeared on the surface of the huge rock once again.</p>

  <p>When everyone saw the ghost face, they were all stunned still.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the ghost face changed as its strange smile faded away, turning its face into one that looked close to tears.</p>

  <p>Upon this sight, everyone's heart tightened.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, be careful!" Janet warned them.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't know what kind of unforeseen problem they would face, they could tell that something bad was about to unfold.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a grimace appeared on the surface of all the square stones in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Don't go in a straight line with these stones," Luo Luo Zheng warned, his eyes flashing as he took a step to the side.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng moved out of the way, beams of light shot out from the stones in four directions.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>These square beams of light were 30 feet high and 30 feet wide, perfectly covering a line of squares on the ground, stretching all the way to the end of the hall.</p>

  <p>Each of these square stones released four square beams of light simultaneously. Since they intersected with each other, there wasn't much space for the martial artists to dodge.</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the square was Luo Luo Zheng. Before him and behind him, the area filled with beams of light? the only options for him were to move to the left and right.</p>

  <p>"These beams of light... They could kill once they are touched. Even though I've warned everyone, I don't know if everyone will be able to hold up." Making sure not to move recklessly at that moment, Luo Luo Zheng had also given a warning.</p>

  <p>So long as he faced the square rock from the front, back, left, or right, the light beam would shine upon him.</p>

  <p>The light beams continued to shoot out. After about thirty seconds, the light gradually dimmed until it completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>After these beams disappeared, two balls of Illusion Points came floating into view.</p>

  <p>"Two people have been killed," Luo Luo Zheng muttered with a twitch of his brows.</p>

  <p>Eight giant square stones connected to each other surrounded the two warriors. It looked like they were trapped in a danger zone with no escape.</p>

  <p>As the crowd saw the two balls of points, their hearts sank. Two people had actually died during this round of light and they had yet to find a way to break it.</p>

  <p>The balls held quite a number of points. According to their calculations, each ball probably had at least three million points? at this time, though, no one was in the mood to absorb them.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Soon after, the huge rocks began rolling again. But instead of chasing after everyone, they connected to each other in a row.</p>

  <p>If these stones were to form a row and shoot out the square beams of light, there would surely be no blind spots in the entire hall? everyone would be left for dead.</p>

  <p>"There's no square stone there!" Luo Luo Zheng called out.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As he sprinted horizontally, Luo Luo Zheng roared. "Here! Everyone, come here!"</p>

  <p>All too quickly, the situation changed, leaving no one any time to think.</p>

  <p>Janet and the six other warriors could only rush toward Luo Luo Zheng as he called out to them.</p>

  <p>The moment the last warrior charged into the square where Luo Luo Zheng was, the row of giant stones released square beams of light simultaneously.</p>

  <p>These square stones were connected to each other, stopping the release of beams from the left and right. But these beams of light from the front and back filled the entire Hall of Causality. There were no blind spots at all.</p>

  <p>In total, there were forty-three square stones. But there were forty-four rows of squares in the hall? the one square stone that was missing was the only chance of survival.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Causality could definitely be passed in a certain way, meaning that it wouldn't block this single chance of survival. Otherwise, it would be a death trap.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Everyone crowded with Luo Luo Zheng before looking at the two sides that were densely covered with enormous beams of light. Their faces were all deathly pale.</p>

  <p>Apart from this place, every other place in the hall was already deadly.</p>

  <p>Under the beams of light, everyone finally had a chance to catch their breath.</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have attacked the stone just now?" someone criticized the short warrior.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng interjected, "No? I'm afraid if we want to pass through this hall, we'll probably have to do so. It was because of his attack that the attack of the Hall of Causality has evolved to this extent."</p>

  <p>If this short martial artist hadn't used the Buddha Curse Blade to attack the square stone, then everyone would have still been chased away by the stones without a way to break it.</p>

  <p>"Well then... How are we supposed to break these stones? Everyone might die if we don't dodge in time! We can't just keep this up, right?" someone asked in worry.</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, Luo Luo Zheng looked toward the depths of the Hall of Causality. Then, he said, "The key is probably still those ghost faces!"</p>

  <p> </p>
