<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the 77th civilization, there were three major sects above the many regions of stars. They were the Human Sect, the Interception Sect, and the Enlightenment Sect.</p>

  <p>The person in front of Zheng now was the leader of the Enlightenment Sect, the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"I have a general understanding of the history of the human race, sir," Zheng offered.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "Do you know why we sowed human seeds in this round of chaos?"</p>

  <p>Zheng lowered his head, thinking for a moment. "It is said that this round of chaos is the last chance to complete the Finale Way," he replied.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded once again. "Right. You know enough. The human race already failed once. We had to retreat to the Other Shore after the failure, but we have never feared anyone!</p>

  <p>The human race was born in the 77th civilization. Before that, the 76 ruling civilizations had already established their foothold on the Other Shore. It was not easy for the human race to fight for a place, but our master led us all the way up."</p>

  <p>"Your master?" Zheng looked confused.</p>

  <p>The jade slips didn't record who the Primeval Lord of Heaven's master was.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that the leaders of the three major sects had had the same master.</p>

  <p>The strength of the Primeval Lord of Heaven might have surpassed that of the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization. The strength of the three leaders' master must have been even greater.</p>

  <p>"The records about my master have been erased by me. The memories related to him can't appear in the mind of any creature on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Even I can no longer recall what he even looked like," the Primeval Lord of Heaven admitted.</p>

  <p>"That explains it! That's why only nine people were recorded to have attempted completion of the Finale Way, when there should have been ten,"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>From the memories, he had seen the human race embark on the Finale Way and fight against that needle.</p>

  <p>King Manard had once mentioned that the human race was well-prepared with a variety of methods to complete the Finale Way. Compared to them, the solution of the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization actually only ranked eighth.</p>

  <p>He had said that there had been ten methods carried out by ten people, but from the memories presented by the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Zheng had only seen nine.</p>

  <p>Zheng initially thought that King Manard must have been mistaken, but it turned out he was right. A memory had just been hidden.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was an intelligent man. He keenly caught the implication of Zheng's words. "You know there really were ten people. How?"</p>

  <p>Zheng cleared his throat awkwardly. After hesitating for a moment, Zheng decided to tell the truth. "I've heard from someone else that ten people were appointed to complete the Finale Way. The one who came the closest to doing it was known as the human ancestor. It's said that the Other Shore Tokens he used were the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone."</p>

  <p>Every single word King Manard had said at that time was committed to Zheng's memory, although he had never seen these aforementioned Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>"Who did you hear this from?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>King Manard had entrusted Zheng to look for the human race on the Other Shore. In a way, Zheng had found them. There was no need to hide anything.</p>

  <p>"He is also a member of the 77th civilization, but he is not on the Other Shore," Zheng said truthfully.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was completely taken aback by this. "What?</p>

  <p>That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>The disbelief showed clearly on his face.</p>

  <p>As a member of the 77th civilization, he naturally knew of the fate of the human race then.</p>

  <p>And what he knew was that the humans of the 77th civilization who had not entered the Other Shore had died and had become a part of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Most of those who entered the Other Shore, excluding the top masters, were also now dead or injured. They hid whatever was left of their waning existence in Stage Thirty Three.</p>

  <p>Humans like Zheng were the fruit of seeds the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the two other leaders quietly planted.</p>

  <p>Thus, no other human was known to exist outside these three groups.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's shocked expression, Zheng couldn't help but smile. It was an unexpected sight on a person he deeply admired.</p>

  <p>"No, he really does come from the 77th civilization, sir. He was only able to avoid the destruction of the chaos by accident."</p>

  <p>"By accident? How?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven pressed, truly amazed.</p>

  <p>"The Son of Truth of the 77th chaos had exiled him into a unique space," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded as realization dawned on him. "That unique space is called the Land of Ashes. The Son of Truth you are talking about must have been a Red Cloud Beast, which was in opposition to the human race at the time. They had exiled many people, including my son.</p>

  <p>But the Land of Ashes is emptied every once in a while, and everything in it is purged, so how could anyone survive that?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's exiled son had disappeared in such a purge, so they were never able to reunite on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"That's what I heard, too. He not only avoided it but actually caused such purges to cease. Since the 77th civilization, everything that is thrown into that space has been preserved. He even calls the shots there now," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled through his astonishment. "If he was exiled by the Red Cloud Beast, he must have been someone of note. May I know his name?"</p>

  <p>"He goes by King Manard," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"King Manard?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was puzzled. He prided himself for his retentive memory. But he remembered no such person.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded at the confused look on the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face.</p>

  <p>"When I was reading your memories, I did note that King Manard was not there. But I encountered him when I was exiled to the Land of Ashes myself. It was he who asked me to look for you."</p>

  <p>Zheng began to detail all he had experienced and learned in the Land of Ashes.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't seem surprised hearing about the Abstruse Energy World. It seemed he was already aware of it.</p>

  <p>His eyes shone brightly after Zheng finished retelling his encounter with King Manard. "So, he actually wants to create another Other Shore! Haha!"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the rules, King Manard can't enter the chaos, nor can he enter the Other Shore. I can, however. If you want to send him a message, I can relay it for you," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No need to hurry," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. With this, he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Their surroundings dissolved in an instant. The stars and the world turned into nothingness. Zheng was left feeling like he was just awakening from a dream.</p>

  <p>He was back in the center of the temple hall. Feng Ge and the human woman were nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>"Young man, come here," called a voice from the statue in the center.</p>

  <p>It was the statue of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, whom Zheng had just met in the illusion. He began to realize the other statues around him must be sentient as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked up to the statue of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the hand of which now held up a book.</p>
