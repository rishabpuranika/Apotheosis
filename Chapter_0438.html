<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At this point, Jacques still had not lost the fight. Under the rules, the fight would be over only when one of the fighters admitted defeat or could not fight again. Otherwise, the competition did not stop. Although he had been thrown out of the field by Zheng, it might be because the light curtain of enchanted barrier was not sturdy enough to absorb the impact of the collision and thus, cracked. Unless Jacques admitted himself beaten, he had to continue the battle.</p>

  <p>By now, Jacques' emotions were complex and indescribable. It was akin to one skilled Chinese go player being matched up with a chess player, but this chess player also had the skills to play go and ultimately won over the go player using the latter's strategy.</p>

  <p>Being defeated in what he considered his jurisdiction was far more frustrating and humiliating for Jacques than any loss he had suffered in the past.</p>

  <p>Still, he had to return to the fighting field regardless of his feelings and thoughts. Now, his previous arrogant face was replaced by a serious look when he stepped back on the field. Jacques stared at Zheng, knowing he must go all out in the coming battle.</p>

  <p>Although he had prepared to fight, there were still doubts in Jacques' mind. He had tested the strength of his white bone armor. Zheng slammed into the armor with extreme force. If his body were not tough enough to endure such force, his bones would have broken like the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>But when Jacques returned to the field, he saw Zheng standing calmly, without any visible injury. 'How did he do that?' Jacques wondered. It confused him more. Unlike the jumble of emotions that Jacques was feeling, Zheng was very much relaxed. After his opponent's return, he just waved his arms, rubbed his hands to prepare, and with a taunting smile, said, "Another hit?</p>

  <p>I'm ready for that!"</p>

  <p>The daring words left Jacques speechless, his heart nearly plummeting.</p>

  <p>He nearly felt blood rise to his throat and come out of his mouth. At the same time, what initially seemed like tiny misgivings now turned into incredulity.</p>

  <p>His white bone armor could easily withstand the attack from a high-level spiritual weapon. It was impossible to penetrate this armor unless it was a fairy weapon. But now with Zheng standing there without any injury after colliding with his metal covering sent a frisson of fear down his spine.</p>

  <p>Did that mean that Zheng's body was as tough as that of a high-level spiritual weapon?</p>

  <p>If that was the case, was he still human?</p>

  <p>Too many thoughts and possibilities were popping up in his chaotic mind. Before facing Zheng in battle, Jacques enjoyed challenging people of a higher level and always came out victorious. He attributed this to his tough white bone armor. But now that he was defeated by a person who only made use of his physical abilities, Jacques felt lost. Any confidence he gained from his previous achievements now seemed insignificant.</p>

  <p>Unknown to Jacques, he was the first to test Zheng's physical strength.</p>

  <p>Before this competition, no one knew the limits to Zheng's physical abilities. He was only injured once, and that was because Tracy, with the power of Blue Phoenix, stabbed him. Other than that episode, no one came close to testing his limits.</p>

  <p>In their battle, Jacques overestimated the toughness of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The strength of Zheng's body was similar to that of a mid-level spiritual weapon. It was only recently when he entered this level, and then he reached the peak of this spiritual weapon level after these days' refinement. Anyway, there was still a huge gap between his body and the high-level spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>But it was Zheng's experience and combat expertise that was a crucial factor in this encounter. He bumped into Jacques' white bone armor with his shoulder. When they slammed into his opponent, his tight and powerful shoulder muscles eased some of the collision force. On the other hand, the force Jacques unleashed towards Zheng's body was automatically transformed into warm currents, which his seemingly mystical body absorbed.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was only a middle-level spiritual weapon, he possessed a magical power which other spiritual weapons lacked, and which was not easily understood.</p>

  <p>As far as the spectators were concerned, they had witnessed Jacques in many successful fights with his hard white bone armor, and this defeat by Zheng was his first. Seeing his serious face now, they understood that Jacques would be trying his best in the next round.</p>

  <p>"You surprise me, Zheng! You really are interesting. It seems I have underestimated your strength. It is unrealistic to vanquish you with pure strength alone," Jacques sneered.</p>

  <p>His remark had Zheng raising an eyebrow. He answered, "Or you can also say that is a naive way of thinking."</p>

  <p>"I have to admit that yes, I was too naive before." Jacques didn't care for the sarcasm in Zheng's words, so he gave him a cold smile. "But now, you will have a taste of my real power. Just a reminder, you will later regret this.</p>

  <p>You will regret standing here to fight me," he said menacingly.</p>

  <p>After issuing the threat, Jacques began to generate a mass of blood fog in his hands. Compared to the previous blood fog, this one had more strength and intensity. It was almost like the blood left by some wild beast from an ancient savage land with highly unusual blood vessels.</p>

  <p>When the cloud of blood gradually dissipated, a bone spear appeared in his hands. The spear shone with a pale green light, and on top of the bone were layers of complex runes.</p>

  <p>He raised the bone spear and stabbed it towards the sky. Instantly, a dragon's roar emanated from the weapon.</p>

  <p>"This is the bone spear made from a section of a flood dragon's spine.</p>

  <p>You are very lucky to be the first to taste its power in the All Peaks Competition!" With a glint in his eyes, Jacques enunciated each word.</p>

  <p>Flood dragon...</p>

  <p>Flood dragon was a category of the dragon, although it was far from being a genuine dragon. It was neither a super legendary beast nor even a normal legendary beast. And it would never come close to Tracy's Blue Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, while Tracy might have the blood of the Blue Phoenix, her current strength was still not enough for her to master the total power of the Phoenix.</p>

  <p>In Jacques' hand was a part of the dragon's spine. Just how powerful the flood dragon bone spear was, no one knew for sure.</p>

  <p>But right after Zheng heard the dragon roar from the bone spear, he felt subtle changes in his mind. He sensed the cyan dragon on the giant furnace in his mind shook a little, which was followed by a barely perceptible roar from the creature.</p>

  <p>The dragon language was strange and complicated, and one Zheng did not comprehend. Many of its syllables were barely audible or were undetectable by human ears.</p>

  <p>So, it took him by surprise that right this moment, it was clear to him what the dragon's roar meant.</p>

  <p>'What?</p>

  <p>You want to eat that bone spear made of the flood dragon's spine?' he asked in his head. Once he understood the dragon's intent, a strange look came over Zheng's face.</p>
