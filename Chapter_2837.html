  <p>
</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui stared at that woman for a while and her eyes turned glassy.</p>

  <p>"Li Luo..." she called her name. There was so much she wanted to say, but she couldn't utter a single word.</p>

  <p>As she gazed at the woman, Li Luoshui felt as if she had been transported back to the early years of the war on the divine land...</p>

  <p>At that time, Li Luo was still an innocent girl. She didn't even care about the reason why the divine land came into being and why the Nine Li race had to leave the Source World.</p>

  <p>She was so curious about everything in this new world.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Time Sea was still a small lake. She liked the magnificent scenery of the lake. She asked people to build a pavilion by the lake.</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui knew at that time that the Nine Li race was in danger. She was filled with melancholy and only Li Luo's innocent smile was able to ease her mind.</p>

  <p>"Sister! How did you become like this?"</p>

  <p>Li Luo floated over, feeling heartbroken.</p>

  <p>She wanted to hold Li Luoshui in her arms, but all that was left of Li Luoshui was her head so she didn't know how to hold her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was baffled when he heard the woman's words.</p>

  <p>Could this woman be his mother's younger sister?</p>

  <p>So that made her his aunt!</p>

  <p>It was confusing at first for Luo Zheng but the more he thought about it the more it made sense. He was not surprised anymore.</p>

  <p>After all, this woman had always maintained that she was a Nine Li member, and Nine Li people all had the same blood.</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui studied Li Luo for a while and said, "You... You are not alive, are you?"</p>

  <p>Although Li Luo looked the same to common people, Li Luoshui could still feel that she didn't have the aura of life. What she emitted was a strong Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>The people of the divine land generally called this the aura of ferocious beasts.</p>

  <p>Pressing her lips together, Li Luo nodded at first. But then she shook her head firmly ad said, "I've never really died. One day, I'll fight all the way back to divine land and rebuild our Nine Li race!"</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui felt a little confused when she sensed Li Luo's deep resentment and looked at Luo Zheng who was beside her.</p>

  <p>"Mother, this is the Abyss Demon Region," Luo Zheng reminded her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words dawned on Li Luoshui.</p>

  <p>She continued, "Li Luo, is your deep resentment due to the disaster of our Nine Li race? Is it because of that you became a ferocious beast in the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui was still confused.</p>

  <p>The forbidden areas were formed by divine citizens' Faith Energy, positive, negative or reverent... Various kinds of Faith Energy might appear in the forbidden areas. And they were the source of the "imagined" fierce beasts.</p>

  <p>But how was it possible for Li Luo to turn into a ferocious beast in the Abyss Demon Region just because of her resentment alone?</p>

  <p>It didn't seem like a plausible theory.</p>

  <p>"No." Li Luo shook her head, and calmly said, "It was because the resentment of the entire Nine Li race was too deep that it turned into the black water. Now this black water has gathered all sorts of resentment of the Nine Li race. They all felt intense fear before their death... And these fears have gathered in the black water!"</p>

  <p>"They?" Li Luoshui raised her eyebrows slightly. "All the members of our Nine Li race are in the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>Li Luo shook her head again. "They have all disappeared. In order to make my memory form a mark that never perishes, they sacrificed themselves..."</p>

  <p>Back then, when Yellow Emperor Guards chased all the way to the divine land, they used the Blood Splitting Technique, turning all the people of the Nine Li race into a mass of blood. They had miserable deaths.</p>

  <p>Numerous Nine Li members suffered from extreme pain and great fear before they died.</p>

  <p>As the fear of all the Nine Li members gathered in the black water, it became the source of fear in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the black water area was not so deep and unfathomable.</p>

  <p>However, as time went by, the imagination of fear from thousands of creatures in the divine land accumulated in the black water area until it reached its current size.</p>

  <p>Fear was also a kind of Faith Energy, but it had its innate memory mark.</p>

  <p>For example, if someone was afraid of something, the fear only existed in that particular person.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the beginning, the force of the primitive fear in the black water consisted of the individual fears of the Nine Li race. Such fears had souls.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li people who still had memories in the black water quickly understood their situation. In a short period of time, their souls would disappear, but the force of their fears within would remain in the black water.</p>

  <p>Over time, the black water would slowly evolve and a variety of strange creatures would appear, such as "the Devils".</p>

  <p>Some members of the Nine Li race realized what would happen and quickly made a decision. They selected a person who would "survive". In the end, Li Luo was the chosen one.</p>

  <p>Those wisps of soul power carried the resentment of the entire Nine Li race, and gathered within Li Luo, making her the master of the black water.</p>

  <p>In the following divine eras, she had been secretly operating the black water. She did not allow the Devils within the black water to have a consciousness and they could only be at the mercy of her command.</p>

  <p>She had also tried to control the fiends, and even the entire Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>After several failed attempts, her gaze had fallen on the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>After listening to Li Luo's monologue, Li Luoshui had a strange look on her face and sighed, "You've suffered a lot. I didn't know that the Nine Li race had such a struggle at the last moment."</p>

  <p>Li Luo walked towards her and held up Li Luoshui's head and pressed it against her forehead. She sobbed, "You have also suffered a lot. I'm so sad to see you look like this..."</p>

  <p>It had been so many years since the two sisters parted. Now that they could reunite, it was under such tragic circumstances. It was a heart-breaking sight.</p>

  <p>"But where am I? I was bound by Nicholas. Where is he?" Li Luoshui looked around and her gaze stopped at the red transparent statue behind her.</p>

  <p>The void was deathly quiet at this point.</p>

  <p>"This is the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region," Luo Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas... might already be dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" Li Luoshui's eyes flashed in astonishment upon hearing his words.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he wanted to refine all of us at the last moment, but Tianming and I destroyed the array set up by him," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thanks to her knowledge and experience, she knew that Nicholas was not invincible.</p>

  <p>But it was hard to digest the fact that this handful of people had defeated Nicholas! It felt like a crazy fantasy. However, when she looked at her son's serious face, she had no reason not to believe him.</p>

  <p>"Then, what's this statue?" Li Luoshui asked.</p>

  <p>This statue seemed to be made for her. It only had a woman's body without the head.</p>

  <p>"This statue..." Luo Zheng was shocked. He didn't think that Nicholas would leave behind such a precious body for his mother.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had wanted to refine a body for himself by taking advantage of his universe and his immortality. But he failed and knew that he couldn't escape death. He had a change of heart at the last moment and left this precious body for his mother.</p>

  <p>"Mother, you can read his last memory by yourself," said Luo Zheng and gently flipped his hand. A small pyramid appeared in it. A tiny eye was carved into the pyramid.</p>

  <p>He turned the pyramid so that the eye was facing Li Luoshui's head. Then he asked her to inject her spiritual sense into it.</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui looked at the small pyramid. She was a bit puzzled but she poured a wisp of spiritual sense into it anyway.</p>

  <p>A long time passed...</p>

  <p>Li Luoshui extracted her spiritual sense and sighed. Nobody knew what was going on in her head.</p>
