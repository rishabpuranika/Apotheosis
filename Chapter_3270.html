<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>These hands were nothing for Zheng. However, the Souls of Light simply found them totally vulnerable to their attacks.</p>

  <p>Even though Dorothy had an Indigo Soul, it was still difficult for her to defend herself.</p>

  <p>More importantly, she had just seen an Ear Mouse being dragged into the wall. The mouse had instantly lost its life. Therefore, she understood what was at stake if the hand won.</p>

  <p>Faced with such a desperate and impossible struggle, the Necklace of Mystic Soul on her chest began to shine. Then, the soul sword shot out and slashed at the hand.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Dorothy let out a gasp. The almost invincible soul sword had only left a shallow mark on that hand!</p>

  <p>And after her first attack failed, the hand reacted so fast that there was no chance for her to launch another one. She was directly dragged towards the wall.</p>

  <p>Just as her body was about to be squeezed into the wall, Zheng rushed over, grabbed the hand with one fist and squeezed. "Crack!" There was a loud snapping sound, and the bones inside the hand were instantly broken to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Yargh!"</p>

  <p>A face on the wall let out a shrill cry of anguish and rushed back into the wall.</p>

  <p>However, more faces appeared on both sides of the passageway and more hands began to come out on both of the walls. It was as if there was an army of attackers around them.</p>

  <p>Zheng wrapped his arms around Dorothy and pulled her towards the center of the passageway. He then called out, "Follow me, all of you!"</p>

  <p>When the Ear Mice saw that even the Soul Protection Shield could not protect them against this unknown foe, their faces turned deathly pale.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>Squeaking shrill cries of fear, they rushed and nestled around Zheng, wishing to enter his body for protection.</p>

  <p>A demonic laughter rang out.</p>

  <p>More hands began to creep out of the walls and the entire passageway was almost filled with the creepy sight.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was standing in the center and was therefore at a distance from them, didn't seem to care. However, if any of the hands tried to reach out and grab the Ear Mice or Dorothy, he would instantly cut them one by one with his bare hand.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>More and more broken pieces of deathly white bones began to pile up on the ground. They were already almost as high as Zheng's knees.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Come here, Tianxing!"</p>

  <p>"Help! Help!"</p>

  <p>"Cut it out!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were all panicking badly. Their temperament and grace were gone. They seemed completely different from what they used to be outside the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, on the other hand, seemed rather calm.</p>

  <p>She wasn't flustered at all when Zheng had thrown his arms around her to protect her. He was keeping a promise and she trusted him.</p>

  <p>Zheng had assured her that he was going to keep her safe, and she knew that he was definitely able to do so. The things she had experienced on the Other Shore had strengthened her faith in Zheng.</p>

  <p>The fight lasted for about fifteen minutes. The pile of bone fragments on the ground could almost reach his waist now. Finally, the noise began to subside.</p>

  <p>No more hands stretched out from the walls, but numerous faces were still floating on them, gazing at Zheng with empty eyes.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Finally they are gone!"</p>

  <p>"Damn! The 19th passageway is really dangerous!"</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, you are really powerful! Squeak! You're our best friend!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the Ear Mice's praise, Zheng merely rolled his eyes. If he were being honest, he didn't want to be friends with them.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are these creatures?" When Dorothy finally came out of Zheng's arms, she stared at the faces on the walls. It was a little creepy to look at and her voice shook a bit.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice was observing the walls intently and said after a while,</p>

  <p>"If I am not wrong, then these faces must be the legendary Wandering Ghosts."</p>

  <p>"Wandering Ghosts?" Zheng repeated in a curious tone.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of them," Dorothy piped up. "Those who cannot return from the Other Shore are referred to as the Wandering Ghosts."</p>

  <p>If a soul died on the Other Shore, the body would become a simple shell.</p>

  <p>However, some people's souls didn't die. Instead, they stayed on the Other Shore forever for some reasons. They were called the Wandering Ghosts.</p>

  <p>A few disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had become Wandering Ghosts, so Dorothy had heard of them.</p>

  <p>"Their souls are enslaved in the walls forever. How poor they are," Zheng sighed as he stared at the faces.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice didn't have much pity for these Wandering Ghosts. They were more concerned about their own lives and business. The latter part was made clear when they waved their hands, and small blue triangles appeared.</p>

  <p>They were going to collect the broken bones lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>In their defense, these arms had displayed astonishing strength. The bones could now be sold as powerful Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>After collecting all of the broken bones, the Ear Mice bowed towards the faces on the walls and then left with Zheng and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>As they moved, so did the faces on the walls.</p>

  <p>After losing their arms, the faces could obviously no longer launch an attack. They could only track the group on its progress through the passageway. Even so, the group was still followed closely by the faces on both sides. The eyes were mainly staring at Zheng. They howled in a voice full of resentment.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had led his group over twenty thousand feet forward, the passageway gradually became wider and turned into a path going up. The blood vessels at the top of the passageway were also beginning to get thicker.</p>

  <p>"What are these things?" Dorothy asked as she raised her head and looked upwards.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked up as well. His eyes narrowed and a flash of surprise appeared.</p>

  <p>"Three hearts? What creature's innards are we in right now?"</p>

  <p>On the top of the passageway, three hearts were hanging, pounding and pumping constantly. Each of them was half as tall as a person. The thick blood vessels they had been following gathered in those hearts.</p>

  <p>Every time the hearts beat, the red light would become dim, and then return to normal on the next beat.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice usually talked in human language, but suddenly, they started to speak in their own tongue. Something had horrified them severely.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy stealthily exchanged glances with dissatisfaction on their faces. What was going on?</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had bought and sold a large number of Other Shore Tokens over the years, which meant that they were experts in identifying the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>They must have recognized the hearts. And it was obvious that they didn't want Zheng and Dorothy to know. Otherwise, why would they start discussing among themselves in their tongue?</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen with his own eyes how shrewd and clever the Ear Mice were.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what they were plotting, but since they didn't want him and Dorothy to know about it, something was definitely up.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened and he said, "Alright then. Since you guys don't want me to know what you are up to, you can go ahead by yourselves. Dorothy and I are going to leave the Grand Sky Temple."</p>

  <p>He was being clever now. The group was still exploring the 19th passageway. Without Zheng, the Ear Mice wouldn't be able to leave the passageway alive, let alone explore the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>These three hearts were quite a significant discovery. The truth was, they wanted to obtain the maximum benefits for their own selves, so they were discussing whether to tell Zheng and Dorothy the truth or not.</p>

  <p>While they were chatting non-stop, they suddenly became anxious when they heard Zheng's words. If he really did leave, they were gone!</p>

  <p>"Squeak! That's not what we meant!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Alright, listen. These are the Hearts of Accomplice. They are one, or rather, three of a kind!"</p>

  <p>"We've only seen one of those in the Source World. And even that was a long time ago. But now, there are three of them in front of us, which is quite a surprise! The Grand Sky Temple is truly a miraculous place!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice explained at once. Obviously, they were very excited about this discovery, but also frightened of him leaving.</p>

  <p>Despite their disorganized and incoherent speech, Zheng and Dorothy still understood what they were trying to say.</p>
