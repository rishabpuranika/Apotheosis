  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>"There!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out his arm and pointed at the grey soft stones in front of him. He moved and rushed towards the stones.</p>

  <p>The moment he approached the stones, his inner world suddenly gave him a strong sense of hunger. It felt like the most delicious food was hidden behind those stones.</p>

  <p>"It's here! I have felt it. The mud is right behind the stones," Luo Zheng stated with certainty.</p>

  <p>Harold nodded in response.</p>

  <p>He went in action but it was not easy for him to break those soft stones.</p>

  <p>His muscles started to swell as his shoulders worked up doubling in volume within three seconds, and his arms were not in proportion to his stature.</p>

  <p>The soft stones couldn't be easily broken with brute force.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Harold thought of another way by abruptly inserting his fingers into the stones. He opened his arms to both sides, and a crack appeared on the layer of the soft stones.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately saw a glimpse of a wide space through the crack.</p>

  <p>Under the dim light, he even saw the round stone plate.</p>

  <p>"It's that cave! It can really move under the ground!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face was filled with excitement. He was about to step in the cave, but was stopped by Harold.</p>

  <p>"Let me go in first," Harold said and made Luo Zheng halt his steps.</p>

  <p>Harold thought that they might come across something strange in the depths of the ground. It was reasonable for him to ensure their safety by going in first.</p>

  <p>He positioned himself in front and climbed through the crack, and Luo Zheng followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Entering the cave, Luo Zheng saw a brown thing running crazily not far away. It was about to enter another crack beside the cave.</p>

  <p>"Don't let that thing get away!" Luo Zheng hurriedly urged.</p>

  <p>The brown thing was the mud that Luo Zheng wanted, which was also the Spiritual Darkness that his mother mentioned.</p>

  <p>"Of course not!"</p>

  <p>Harold answered plainly. He effortlessly waved his hand in the air.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Darkness on the verge of escape froze on the spot. It kept squeaking with fear as it was suddenly grabbed by an invisible force. No matter how hard it struggled, it couldn't get rid of the invisible force.</p>

  <p>Harold's hand which was stretched pulled back towards his chest, and the Spiritual Darkness immediately flew backwards falling in front of the two.</p>

  <p>Right at the same time, something happened.</p>

  <p>Once again, strange shadows with long hands and feet appeared in the walls around the cave.</p>

  <p>"This cave is a trap!" After seeing those shadows, Harold became more vigilant.</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Zheng had an encounter with those shadows but he swiftly ran away and avoided them before they came out of the stones.</p>

  <p>What Harold said was reasonable. This cave was probably a trap set by his mother. If some people broke in, they wouldn't miss it. They would either run away or stay behind to fight against the strange shadows in the stones.</p>

  <p>For another encounter, Luo Zheng was well prepared. The situation didn't give him a start and what was more, with the help of Harold, he didn't panic at all.</p>

  <p>He moved fast and caught the Spiritual Darkness. His fingers ran down the mud on the body of the Spiritual Darkness, and soon found a bead.</p>

  <p>Grasping tight, he took the bead out.</p>

  <p>He hurriedly said to the bead, "Mother, it's me. I'm Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Darkness was manipulated by Lorena and the bead was its center. Last time, it was through the bead that Luo Zheng was able to see his mother.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!" Harold persistently said, staring at the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>The figures in the wall became clearer and clearer. They exuded a strong aura and a strong sense of hostility.</p>

  <p>In another space, Lorena suddenly opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's him. He's back!" A flash of light gleamed on her crimson eyes as she saw Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Last time, she had seen her son through the Spiritual Darkness, but before she could finish her words, the bead exploded.</p>

  <p>She never thought that Luo Zheng would once again return to this cave.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to respond, she discovered a very familiar thing between Luo Zheng's eyebrows. It was a trace of her memory.</p>

  <p>"When did I ever leave a memory between his eyebrows?" Lorena felt strange, but as a red light flashed in her eyes, the silver light between Luo Zheng's eyebrows instantly flew into the bead of the Spiritual Darkness and into her mind.</p>

  <p>In this way, she had obtained the memory of the incarnation of fear.</p>

  <p>She read the memory and suddenly came upon a realization. "It turned out that I asked him to come. Moreover, he has obtained the inheritance of the debate venue!"</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Lorena's head slowly rose from the big pot, and the Spiritual Darknesses quickly transformed into her body.</p>

  <p>"You all stop!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Lorena's command, the huge figures inside the walls immediately stopped moving forward and froze in the rocks.</p>

  <p>"We made it. My mother has already known we're here," Luo Zheng said as he stared at the eye of the Spiritual Darkness.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't see her mother at the moment, he knew that she had absorbed the memory that the incarnation of fear left.</p>

  <p>Harold nodded and said, "I'm glad to hear that!"</p>

  <p>The truth was, he still kept thinking about what could be happening in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Both Hallet and Augustus might be powerful, but he was still worried about them meeting some dangers in that forest. He hoped that Luo Zheng could meet his mother quickly for him to return back to the forest to help Hallet and Augustus.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed as they silently waited.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Cracking sounds were suddenly heard from the left corner of the cave.</p>

  <p>A crack appeared among the rocks. It looked like a monster with its mouth wide open.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Right then, a figure with a long hair flashed by and firmly stood in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The figure in front of Luo Zheng was his mother, Lorena, whom he had met in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Meeting his mother in the debate venue was, however, different from this moment. What he saw before was only the incarnation of his mother, and in front of him right now was his real mother.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Lorena,"</p>

  <p>Harold greeted with a reverent bow.</p>

  <p>Lorena glanced at Harold. "Thank you for bringing Luo Zheng here in person."</p>

  <p>"It's my pleasure," Harold replied humbly.</p>

  <p>Lorena nodded and turned to look at Luo Zheng, her son.</p>

  <p>She had already absorbed all the memories of her incarnation. But for herself, it was the first time she really had contact with her son face to face.</p>

  <p>She touched Luo Zheng's face, revealing an attractive smile on her face. "Luo Zheng, please follow me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mother," Luo Zheng resolutely answered and nodded.</p>

  <p>Before leaving with his mother, Luo Zheng naturally would not forget to activate the mountain token.</p>

  <p>The activated mountain token took Harold to the Immortal Mansion in a flash.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng put it away and walked towards the crack along with his mother.</p>
