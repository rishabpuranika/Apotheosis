  <p>
</p>

  <p>In most cases, they say that eternity was nothing but a synonym for destruction.</p>

  <p>"Running water is never stale, and a door hinge never gets worm-eaten."</p>

  <p>Only something so dynamic could achieve genuine eternity.</p>

  <p>This was inside the thoughts of the bronze monkey.</p>

  <p>If there was not a single blood-receiver that could enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard, then the place would lose the purpose of its existence.</p>

  <p>After the Eternal Divine Courtyard was sealed by the Time Lock, it was regarded to be worthless and was just something that awaited its impending destruction.</p>

  <p>But in the end, this human unexpectedly broke in and soaked himself into the sacred cup without hesitation.</p>

  <p>With this, this human actually extended the lifespan of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Now, changes that were never foreseen should be expected.</p>

  <p>The bronze human also had the same thought, so he immediately stopped the bronze bird and the bronze snake.</p>

  <p>After some time, the four bronze statues came to an agreement. In the meantime, they would quietly observe the sacred cup and see what would happen.</p>

  <p>Still shrouded in darkness, all of the light dots that appeared in front of Luo Zheng had been completely lit up. They were arranged in such a way that they formed four neat triangles together.</p>

  <p>At this time, the meanings contained within the light dots were all grasped by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'The meaning of power is completely beyond the limits of the chaos.' Luo Zheng was immersed in this thought.</p>

  <p>The power of the three thousand Divine Dao was based on the most original power of the chaos, which was also the foundation of the entire chaos. On the other hand, the three hundred and seventy-three entities of power in the light dots were way more extensive and profound. They covered wider ranges and were formed based on rules of higher levels.</p>

  <p>They could even be called the origin of everything.</p>

  <p>Inside Luo Zheng's mind, this information flashed like bolts of lightning. All of a sudden, he seemed to have a fair understanding of everything.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>All of the lights intensely brightened as Luo Zheng's eyes snapped open.</p>

  <p>Eventually, he regained all of his six senses. He had a brief struggle to adapt as his consciousness gradually returned. It was like the sensation of being awakened from a very long dream.</p>

  <p>He was still lying quietly inside the sacred cup, staring blankly at the huge dome of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. He felt sort of light-headed as his consciousness was still somewhat in a blur.</p>

  <p>Then, he gently moved a finger, followed by his arms, legs, until he could already feel his whole body.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With a quick somersault, Luo Zheng leaped from the cup and landed steadily on the ground. As he looked down, he noticed that there was a perfect bloodline map sketched on the square.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The four bronze statues immediately jumped into the square again. This time, they all showed deep respect on their faces.</p>

  <p>After all, as long as one could get the approval of the ancestry-level bloodline, it would be more than enough to make them bow down in respect. This was because all creatures that were approved by the ancestry-level bloodline were regarded as the top talents in the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng turned out as someone beyond their comprehension as he directly absorbed all of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>As they looked at Luo Zheng, they were no longer able to define his abilities.</p>

  <p>Never did they expect that such a thing could possibly happen.</p>

  <p>"Human, what are your plans after inheriting the ancestry-level bloodline?" the bronze human asked while bowing respectfully to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately knew that the changes in their attitudes were only brought by him merging with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>He wondered if the bloodline was really worth that much respect from them.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Luo Zheng had a precise feeling that the bloodline flowing within him was indeed something extraordinary.</p>

  <p>"My plans? Of course, I would be returning to my world," Luo Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>He knew that he rarely had anything to do with the Eternal Divine Courtyard, so he didn't see any reason to stay behind. Now that he had achieved his goal in this place, he decided that it was time to return.</p>

  <p>He was actually been trapped here for so long, and he was worried that something bad might have happened to the Taiyi Heaven Palace during his long absence.</p>

  <p>With his nonchalant reply, there was an obvious change in the expressions of the four bronze statues.</p>

  <p>They had actually figured out that Luo Zheng was most probably from another world.</p>

  <p>However, those worlds were insignificant in the eyes of bronze statues.</p>

  <p>The only thing that was important for them was the Eternal Divine Courtyard, as well as the shackle attached to it? the Time Lock that had sealed the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"You're going to return to your original world? What for? Does that even matter now?" The bronze monkey didn't understand Luo Zheng's logic so he was totally confused.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was kind of annoyed by the response of the bronze monkey and said,</p>

  <p>"Then can you tell me what matters?"</p>

  <p>"Human, you have acquired the ancestry-level bloodline. You can be considered as the new master of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Don't you want to start anew in this place?" the bronze human hinted at Luo Zheng with a pleasant smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was kind of surprised. "The new master? Do you really think so? I could really assume that position?" he asked with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>The four bronze statues exchanged glances then fell silent. This immediately made Luo Zheng see through their facade.</p>

  <p>At the back of the minds of the bronze statues, the real master of the Eternal Divine Courtyard would always be the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the purpose of the existence of the statues was to protect the ancestry-level bloodline, and make sure that it was safeguarded in the Eternal Divine Courtyard throughout generations.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's unexpected appearance gave the bronze statues a new idea.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had absorbed the ancestry-level bloodline, he could really be considered as the new master of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. With his power, he could even restart and continue the legacy of the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"First, I have no intention to be the master of this place. I just got what I needed according to the rules. Maybe I'll come back when the proper time calls for it, but right now, I have to return to my original world as soon as possible," Luo Zheng explained to the bronze statues.</p>

  <p>Right after he spoke, Luo Zheng tapped his toe on the ground.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A square dimension spread out from beneath his feet, and a passageway opened on the ground that instantly swallowed him in.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, Luo Zheng fell into the space below the Eternal Divine Courtyard. It was the space where the bloodline known as the Infinite Time and Space existed.</p>

  <p>Since it had been a long time since Luo Zheng had entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the spider man who was imprisoned in that cube believed that Luo Zheng should've already died. Thinking about this, his heart was filled with regret.</p>

  <p>He had almost succeeded in saving himself.</p>

  <p>If he had just lured Luo Zheng into the cube, he should've escaped already from this damned place.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he thought that he should have been the one who got the chance to acquire and merge with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Now, he thought that he might never have the chance to escape.</p>

  <p>The spider man didn't have anything to do but recall the scene over and over again. With just a simple mistake, his situation had turned out for the worst.</p>

  <p>However, while he was wallowing in his regrets, he had no clue that he was about to meet Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Then, without any warning, Luo Zheng abruptly appeared in this space once more.</p>

  <p>The spider man's eyes widened as soon as he saw him. He started speaking to him in his unique language, ignoring his disheveled hair.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, translate it for me," Luo Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly activated its core and translated what the spider man was saying.</p>

  <p>"Young man, did you get the ancestry-level bloodline?" the spider man asked impatiently. However, he strongly believed that Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to obtain it. He thought that Luo Zheng must have left the Eternal Divine Courtyard without gaining anything.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think?" Instead of answering directly, Luo Zheng just answered back with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"if you didn't get the ancestry-level bloodline, I can teach you the skill for merging the Infinite Time and Space. Even with just this, you will be strong enough!" The spider man offered eagerly. It was as if he had completely forgotten that he had attempted on attacking Luo Zheng the previous time they met.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng pretended to be interested in what he was saying. He descended to the cube where the spider man was and asked, "What is this skill that you're talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Give me a finger then! Hurry! I'll demonstrate it for you!" The spider man's eyes seemed to be unusually desperate. He forced a smile and thought that Luo Zheng was a fool.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng went along and stretched out one of his fingers.</p>

  <p>As soon as his finger was stuck into the cube, the spider man grabbed it desperately, as if it was his last lifeline.</p>

  <p>He believed that if he could successfully pull Luo Zheng inside, everything would work out for him. He was thrilled and nervous at the same time.</p>

  <p>However, while he touched Luo Zheng's finger, his movement suddenly stopped, and his expression changed drastically.</p>
