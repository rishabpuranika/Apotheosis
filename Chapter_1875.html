  <p>
</p>

  <p>He was definitely not one of Liusu's henchmen to bid at her orders.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu curled her lips, revealing a bitter expression. But immediately her expression changed as if she had thought of a plan.</p>

  <p>As he continued forward, Luo Zheng discovered that these mushroom-like platforms varied in size. The further he went, the bigger the mushrooms became.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the fighters on the platforms looked stronger.</p>

  <p>Finally, Han Liusu brought Luo Zheng up with her and stepped onto a platform with a diameter of over a thousand feet. There were only over a hundred cultivators on this spacious platform, so they could move around freely on it.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng jumped onto the platform, the warriors from other races glared at him with furious expressions!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was slightly stunned after seeing their expressions.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, the black water below began to surge violently. A whirlpool appeared under every platform, and Zheng's platform had the largest whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Swishy swash!</p>

  <p>The warriors who had been glaring at Luo Zheng and Han Liusu, shifted their focus to the water as the intense sounds of waves crashing against each other echoed through the air.</p>

  <p>The platform began to fill with round divine textures. At the feet of Luo Zheng and Han Liusu, a divine texture had also appeared.</p>

  <p>"Quickly, infuse your life vitality into the divine texture," Han Liusu suggested.</p>

  <p>"What for?" Luo Zheng asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Just try it!" Han Liusu urged at him.</p>

  <p>By now Luo Zheng had already guessed something serious was going on. He was no fool. From the moment he had entered this place, the warriors on the platform had been on high alert.</p>

  <p>It was evident that there was limited source in the platform. According to Zheng's estimation, this kind of resource should be comparable to the strength source. After all, the Skyland race was a sacred place for cultivation that was on the same level as that of the Collapsing Mountain race. They would also have to pay the purple trial tally.</p>

  <p>As for the resource on each platform, it was definitely limited. That was why the warriors were wary and didn't want the newcomers to join in.</p>

  <p>Right now, the platform beneath Zheng's feet was the biggest, but there were only over a hundred warriors on it. This was even more abnormal.</p>

  <p>The only probable reason was that no ordinary warriors from other races would dare to step foot on this platform.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng understood as to why Han Liusu required his help to beat someone.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng did not mind it much. By now even he was curious about this place and wanted to see what exactly this Tidal Surge was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was naturally unable to infuse his life vitality into the divine texture, but he could easily replace it with chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>With this thought in mind, Luo Zheng extracted a trace of chaotic energy and poured it into the divine texture beneath his feet through the meridians in his legs.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu was also extremely focused at her task. As her ten slender fingers intertwined with each other, she formed a colorful life vitality stream and poured it into the divine texture below her feet.</p>

  <p>The instant the chaotic energy was infused within, the divine texture slowly rotated, as though something was about to escape from it.</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter!</p>

  <p>At this moment, the flowing black water beneath them had intensified even further, along with the luster of divine textures.</p>

  <p>After a strand of chaotic energy entered, it was quickly devoured by the divine texture. Luo Zheng could only replenish one at a time.</p>

  <p>For ordinary divine texture, a single strand of chaotic energy was more than enough to be poured into it. But, Luo Zheng continued to pour in several strands of chaotic energy, all of them being sucked dry by the divine texture beneath his feet, as if it was a bottomless pit!</p>

  <p>A look of curiosity appeared on his face, but he didn't know what the purpose of this divine texture was. However, the amount of chaotic energy in his inner world was so vast that it didn't matter much. He continuously kept infusing the chaotic energy into the divine texture.</p>

  <p>Although a great deal of chaotic energy had been injected into it, it was still a drop in the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>The black water surged upwards and the waves continued to crash for another five minutes. Soon it calmed down.</p>

  <p>As soon as the black water calmed down, black crystals began to shoot out from the divine texture beneath everyone's feet!</p>

  <p>The black crystals were about the size of a finger, and they fell to the ground with a clattering sound.</p>

  <p>Many warriors looked relieved the moment the black crystals shot out.</p>

  <p>They immediately grabbed them in their hands before they fell into the water.</p>

  <p>Around three to four black crystals would appear next to each martial artist. Most people would choose to swallow them at the first possible moment.</p>

  <p>The bigger the platform, the more black crystals it could extract!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Liusu's platform was the largest. It was seven or eight times larger than the surrounding platforms. Because the number of warriors on this platform was less, each of the divine textures should have churned out around thirty to forty crystals But on this platform, the hundred warriors including Han Liusu, had yet to refine a single black crystal.</p>

  <p>They were all glaring at Luo Zheng, as if they wanted nothing more than to kill him. But apart from anger, the warriors were also filled with wonder and disbelief.</p>

  <p>The black crystals were being produced from the divine texture at Zheng's feet. In the blink of an eye, the black crystals surrounding Luo Zheng piled up like a small mountain. There were probably four to five thousand of them!</p>

  <p>Sensing the strong hatred from those people, Luo Zheng revealed an innocent smile on his face. He shrugged his shoulders apologetically, indicating that he didn't know how it happened. He didn't know what these black crystals were, either.</p>
