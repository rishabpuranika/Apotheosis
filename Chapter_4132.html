<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't care less about the Evil God's ridicule. Instead, he asked,</p>

  <p>"Are you eavesdropping on us?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in the Source World that can escape my perception," the Evil God scoffed. "Everything here belongs to me and can be used by me.</p>

  <p>Why would I ever need to eavesdrop on you?"</p>

  <p>This was an exaggeration, because the Source World was not his inner world. He wasn't all-knowing as he claimed.</p>

  <p>However, it was true that no one could surpass his control over the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Evil God continued, "If you submit to me, I will make you the ruler of the Source World. All the creatures and super forces of the provinces will submit to you. We can build the Source World together. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>As he said this, he waved his hand gently.</p>

  <p>Numerous emerald green vines quickly grew around the Li Shan mountain. Leaves ten feet wide uncurled and revealed strange flowers. The refreshing fragrance of flowers spread everywhere, and soon enough, the whole mountain was an emerald green sea.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race and the human race that were in the Li Shan mountain at that time were shocked to see this unfold.</p>

  <p>"Whose method is this?"</p>

  <p>"With so much greenery covering the mountain, I'm afraid only the Chaos Ancient God who is in charge of the life truth can do it."</p>

  <p>"Why did he do that?"</p>

  <p>Because the people of the Li Shan mountain didn't know the existence of the Evil God, they weren't afraid at all.</p>

  <p>"I politely refuse," Luo Zheng said without hesitation.</p>

  <p>He was completely different from the Evil God, which meant there was no way he would cooperate.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was not surprised at Luo Zheng's answer. With one wave of his hand, the plants swayed towards him as if they were bowing. "There are three hundred and twenty-three million nine hundred and seventy thousand creatures living in this huge mountain. Most of them are weak.</p>

  <p>If they absorb even a drop of poisonous fog, they'd be dead. It is quite pitiful to kill all of them at once."</p>

  <p>A low plant hidden away among the sea of plants was summoned by the Evil God; it was called the Poisonous Dust Grass. In the center of the grass lay a fist-sized fruit that held the deadliest poison.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>The Evil God pointed his finger at the fruit, and it cracked. Just then, a poisonous bright yellow mist burst out and began to spread.</p>

  <p>Whatever the poisonous mist enveloped withered and died. It was obvious that the mist was toxic.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warriors were not afraid of the poisonous mist. From experience, it had always been difficult for the poisonous mist to kill the Chaotic Source Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>However, there were only a few people above the Chaotic Source Realm in the Li Shan mountain. If the Evil God released all the poisonous mist from the grass, surely ninety-nine percent of the people on the mountain would die.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you reconsider my suggestion?" the Evil God threatened Luo Zheng with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Gerald chuckled.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a green light flashed within his eyes and a green magic array hovered over his head, spinning non-stop.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The life energy of the flowers and trees across the mountain quickly faded and were absorbed by Gerald's body.</p>

  <p>As Gerald extracted all the life energy of the plants within a second, the Poisonous Dust Grass also withered and died.</p>

  <p>He said, "Do not ever threaten us with such a dirty trick!"</p>

  <p>Though it was true that the Evil God had killed one Chaos Ancient God, three Chaos Ancient Gods and a group of Eternal Realm warriors still existed in the Li Shan mountain. It would never be easy to get rid of them all.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Gerald destroyed his plants as if they were nothing, the Evil God did not flinch.</p>

  <p>Instead, he grinned. "Well then, I can only use the real method."</p>

  <p>Once he finished speaking, his body disintegrated and the dust flew away with the wind.</p>

  <p>In the Sword Blade Peak, a group of human disciples concentrated on their cultivation.</p>

  <p>The youngest disciple was only twelve years old. Despite his young age, he had great talent and made rapid progress within half a year after he'd entered the Sword Blade Peak.</p>

  <p>He was already comprehending the Truth of Divine Dao with a sword in his arms.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, his face blurred. The next moment, his body transformed into the Evil God and he jumped up from the ground. The sword he held broke in the hands of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Where is our little brother?"</p>

  <p>"Did you just take over him?"</p>

  <p>The surrounding disciples were left speechless.</p>

  <p>Even though many of them were Other Shore Realm warriors, they had never witnessed a token that allowed someone to directly possess a body. The aura emitted by the Evil God was too strong and was most probably at the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Do not fear. You are a part of me too." The Evil God smiled.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the disciples' faces blurred in the same way as the twelve-year-old disciple did. Just then, they all turned into the Evil Gods.</p>

  <p>In his battle against Othniel, the Evil God better grasped the body possessing token.</p>

  <p>It seemed that even if he was physically hundreds of millions of miles away, he could directly possess another being. The person he possessed gave him a body to use, which allowed him to possess the people around him, too.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The next moment, dozens of Evil Gods from the Sword Blade Peak appeared in the air above the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>This didn't happen in only Sword Blade Peak.</p>

  <p>The other peaks went through the same thing.</p>

  <p>The members of the Snake Goddess race and the human race turned into the Evil Gods and one by one appeared above the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yudie, Xun, Xi Youqin and Luo Zheng's other women in the Dark Haze Peak had no idea what happened outside. All they saw was the greenery that blossomed all of a sudden, and withered the next moment.</p>

  <p>Yudie and Xun had a bad inkling in their guts. Just then, a few of their servants began to twitch. When they turned around to get a better look, they saw that their faces had changed.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God!" Yudie couldn't believe her eyes.</p>

  <p>They did not anticipate the Evil God's appearance.</p>

  <p>When the newly transformed avatars of the Evil God caught sight of Yudie, Xun, and the others, sinister smiles plastered across their faces. "Interesting... Luo Zheng actually let you out. It's too bad that you aren't from the Source World. I can't possess you."</p>

  <p>The Evil God could only control creatures from the Source World.</p>

  <p>Because Yudie, Xun, and the rest were from the divine land, they were completely out of the loop.</p>

  <p>As they saw the Evil Gods approach them, Xi Youqin raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to do?"</p>

  <p>Yudie, Xun and the other women pulled out their weapons and held their fighting stances.</p>

  <p>"All I want is for your husband to cooperate with me. It would be best for you to be obedient too," the Evil Gods recited in chorus.</p>

  <p>Yudie frowned and considered her options. She looked up and said without fear, "Evil God, Luo Zheng has done nothing but treat you well. He even let go of your wife, Edna. It's unreasonable of you to attack us."</p>

  <p>Seeing Yudie's determination, the Evil Gods merely snorted at her.</p>

  <p>Nothing could ever restrain the Evil God. Otherwise, he wouldn't have returned to Luo Zheng time to time.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that what Yudie had said affected him. One of the Evil Gods hesitated for a moment then snapped his fingers. "Retreat!"</p>

  <p>The Evil Gods didn't lay a finger on any of them and eventually, disappeared.</p>

  <p>Once they were gone, Xi Youqin began to worry about Luo Zheng. "The Evil God has so many avatars. I fear Luo Zheng's safety."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yudie ran out of the hall and looked up to the sky. Her jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>The sky above the Li Shan mountain was packed with the Evil Gods that hovered and increased in number.</p>
