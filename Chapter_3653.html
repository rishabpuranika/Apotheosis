<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm had more than eighty royal guards.</p>

  <p>They were divided into three ranks according to their strength.</p>

  <p>Dugan was a very strong warrior and was near the top of the second rank.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth's strength belonged in the first rank even though she was not a royal guard.</p>

  <p>Of course, as the leader of the Divine Lair, Elizabeth had an extraordinarily superior status in the Sun Crow race. Even the most powerful royal guards were not as good as her.</p>

  <p>Micah and Bagot were at the top of the first rank of the royal guards.</p>

  <p>But even though they were the highest in rank, they always kept a low profile. They guarded the Sun Crow race all the time and they rarely showed up in public.</p>

  <p>There was no hint of a doubt that they were absolutely loyal to Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>The battle in which the Sun Crow race had gone all out was a huge test for their abilities. After all, the Oneness Sky Palace was heavily defended and by no means weak.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Micah flapped his wings so hard as he went upward.</p>

  <p>The one who was constantly retreating to the covers of the sky was none other than Auden from the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He kept flying and retreating in the air, with three evil eyes floating all around him.</p>

  <p>The three evil eyes constantly blinked. Every time they blinked, a flying sword with a sharp blade shot out quickly.</p>

  <p id="top_19">These flying swords looked ordinary, but the power contained in them was truly terrifying.</p>

  <p>Even a powerful warrior like Micah would not be able to withstand a single stab from the flying sword. The flying sword was really deadly.</p>

  <p>Micah had already suffered from two strikes from trying to get close to Auden previously. As a result, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body had been tremendously exhausted.</p>

  <p>After that, Micah was so careful in pursuing Auden that he did not dare to fight head on.</p>

  <p>So even though his speed was far faster than Auden's, he still did not approach him.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The flying swords continuously shot out viciously from the three evil eyes.</p>

  <p>There was a profoundly serious look on Auden's old face.</p>

  <p>He could not remember how long it was since his last battle. At this critical moment, he had no choice but to go all out.</p>

  <p>With his wings flapping tirelessly, Micah moved gracefully in the air from left to right as he dodged the flying swords. With every flying sword he dodged, he closed the distance between him and Auden.</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace is doomed. We both know that you are a famous veteran in the palace, so you must be able to assess the situation clearly. If you submit to the Sun Crow race, our emperor will forget everything you did in the past," Micah said as he approached.</p>

  <p>Back then, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm were as close as brothers. However, the two became hostile and cold to each other later.</p>

  <p>Auden had scolded and embarrassed Emperor Charm right in his face, so they bore grudges and resentment against each other.</p>

  <p>The three evil eyes floating beside Auden were constantly rolling, so the angle of the flying swords was quickly adjusted. He smiled lightly and said,</p>

  <p>"Swordsmen attach great importance to moral integrity. So you must be aware that if the Oneness Sky Palace falls, we will kill ourselves with our swords. I don't care whether Emperor Charm will forget the past or not!"</p>

  <p>Micah stared at Auden indifferently. He knew very well that Auden was a stubborn man. Besides, he didn't mean to convince him. The reason why he was conversing with him was to distract him.</p>

  <p>"The path that our emperor follows is the only true solution. It would be for your good if you just surrender and completely submit to him," Micah said calmly.</p>

  <p>The corners of Auden's mouth curled up into a smirk. He said in a rather disdainful tone, "When it comes to choosing the right way, you demonic birds surely can't think independently, can you? You just blindly follow your emperor. What a pity. Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Because of the bloodline worship, Emperor Charm always had the final say in the Sun Crow race. Even though Elizabeth and Micah were extremely intelligent, they had no doubt about Emperor Charm's thoughts and decisions.</p>

  <p>Since the Oneness Sky Palace didn't adhere to bloodline worship, they didn't have the same situation. No matter how wise and powerful Eastern Emperor Taiyi was, his subordinates would always give him advice when he did something wrong. Therefore, it was reasonable for Auden to despise the Sun Crow race and their bloodline worship.</p>

  <p>However, just as Auden finished speaking, the corner of Micah's mouth curled up into a grin. A white light rushed over from his back at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>When Auden realized what had happened, he was unable to dodge Micah's attack. His eyes suddenly opened wide, and a crescent shaped bubble appeared on the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>The white light that was rapidly approaching him was Bagot of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>He was fighting with Pearce at first. But after he activated his bloodline power, he greatly increased his speed and shifted to attack Auden secretly.</p>

  <p>At such an incredible speed, Bagot was extremely confident that he could wreck Auden with a single blow!</p>

  <p>However, the fragile-looking bubble that appeared on the surface of Auden's body turned out to be incredibly tougher than what Bagot expected.</p>

  <p>Under the impact of Bagot's attack and speed, the bubble was constantly compressed and deformed, but it did not break.</p>

  <p>With a bow, Auden managed to distance himself from Bagot. The three evil eyes around him emitted an even more ferociously blinding light.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The vicious flying swords continued to attack Micah.</p>

  <p>When Bagot was about to launch another attack, a sharp sword light suddenly fell from the sky and blocked him.</p>

  <p>With a grim face, Pearce said, "Bagot, I'd like to remind you that your opponent is me!"</p>

  <p>Bagot frowned and stared at Pearce fiercely.</p>

  <p>Although their strength was pretty much the same, it was extremely difficult to fight against Pearce. Bagot was angry and annoyed to have Pearce as his opponent.</p>

  <p>He planned to kill Auden first, and then deal with Pearce together with Micah.</p>

  <p>The four of them confronted each other as they were in the air.</p>

  <p>However, the intense confrontation did not last long.</p>

  <p>A large number of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, led by Elizabeth and Dugan, flew over to them from below.</p>

  <p>When Bagot saw the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, he was extremely overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"Just in time! They finally made it!"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the faces of Pearce and Auden darkened.</p>

  <p>Previously, they had really hoped that these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows would be of help to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>But Elizabeth had taken them back sooner than they expected. They realized that Zheng, the controller of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, might be in danger.</p>

  <p>Pearce and Auden looked at each other grimly, their eyes filled with regret.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the Oneness Sky Palace collapsed was way faster than they had imagined.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows emerged from below and formed a small island floating in the air. Elizabeth and Dugan stood side by side, while Micah and Bagot followed behind them.</p>

  <p>Micah and Bagot could sense if the Other Shore Tokens or other methods, such as the Inner-world Generating Avatar, were used to control people's thoughts or souls.</p>

  <p>Never did they think that Elizabeth and Dugan would submit to another Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"Elder Auden, Elder Pearce, I'd like to give you one final chance," Micah continued. He really wanted to recruit the two of them to their side.</p>

  <p>However, they completely ignored him. They had long wanted to sacrifice themselves, and now was the time for them to fight desperately to the end.</p>

  <p>"Cut this crappy nonsense!" Pearce shouted coldly.</p>

  <p>The sword blades wildly vibrated, and his aura soared.</p>

  <p>Just as Auden and Pearce were about to fight desperately to their deaths, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, which originally spread out in the air, suddenly rolled up.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng showed up from under one of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>
