<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the thin streaks of light released from the Magnetic Light Extreme Form were cut off, the magnetic energy immediately stopped.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline began continuously transferring the energy from the life quadrant. This was done to compensate for Zheng's incomplete body.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the newly regrown flesh and bones were not as good as before. Nevertheless, Zheng had to make do with it for now.</p>

  <p>Even though his body had somewhat recovered, everything was still a blur to him. He did not quite understand what just happened.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Obsession Civilization's core was able to help Zheng decipher Sanskrit words. It even helped him decipher the scenes from the main world. However, he was still unable to understand everything clearly.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey saw that his father was still in a daze. Because of that, he gave another order to the Heavenly Ring Staff, "Help him with the Soul Reincarnation. Do as we did before. Extract the energy from him!"</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng heard a swishing sound.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey gave his command, the Heavenly Ring Staff carried out the order surprisingly fast.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng saw the Heavenly Ring Staff flash before Geoffrey pointed to his head. At this moment, he was still utterly befuddled. In just a split second, he felt an intense pain that almost shattered his soul.</p>

  <p>The pain one would feel from the Soul Reincarnation was truly indescribable. In simple terms, it was like breaking and reorganizing the original soul. It was an excruciatingly painful kind of suffering. It was already a miracle that Elder Xue was able to reach that high in the Levitation Tower.</p>

  <p>When the pain finally stopped, Zheng slowly opened his eyes. He couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>The scenes that were flashing before his eyes earlier were no longer presented by the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. All at once, everything became clear to him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he heard Geoffrey's voice. "Father! Are you alright? How do you feel?" Geoffrey was thoroughly relieved that his father finally came to his senses.</p>

  <p>"I... What happened to me?" Zheng stared at his hands in shock. This was quite unbelievable!</p>

  <p>"You have undergone the Soul Reincarnation. So now, you can move freely in the Abstruse Energy World!" Geoffrey looked at him and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Wait... What happened to Master Ziya just now? He was just right here a moment ago." Zheng looked around because this scenery felt unreal to him.</p>

  <p>He had no idea what exactly just happened. He wondered why Ziya suddenly disappeared from their midst.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Ring Staff requires a massive amount of energy to absorb.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Master Ziya didn't have enough. He might have just burnt his Other Shore Tokens," Geoffrey responded with a sad look on his eyes.</p>

  <p>Not once had he ever stepped foot on the Other Shore. Yet, he still knew a lot about the Other Shore Tokens. It was fairly obvious to him that Ziya had been punished by burning the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>"He burnt his Other Shore Tokens?!"</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm regarded this method as their last resort. Zheng didn't expect that Ziya would be so stubborn.</p>

  <p>He was still in a state of shock when a blinding flash of light suddenly illuminated the entire sky.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish was floating above. At once, the spiral lights began gathering in its open mouth.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Starry Roc-fish shouted, "Magnetic Light Extreme Form. Magnetic energy impact!"</p>

  <p>They heard strange buzzing sounds around them.</p>

  <p>The spiral lights whirled rapidly in circles down from the air. All at once, they began to attack the hexagonal enchanted barrier above Zheng and Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang! The spiral lights bombarded the barrier one after another.</p>

  <p>The sound of the spiral lights crashing onto the enchanted barrier was like a woodpecker eagerly picking away at a tree trunk.</p>

  <p>The magnetic energy's destructive force was truly astonishing. By now, the surface of the enchanted barrier had been dented by this barrage of attacks. Little by little, cracks began to form.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Heavenly Ring Staff was under Zheng's control. The ancestry-level bloodline was continuously replenishing its energy. The dented and broken enchanted barrier was quickly restored to its original state. There was no amount of outside energy that could break it.</p>

  <p>"The Polygon Extreme Form is indeed one of the most powerful defensive methods. However, the Magnetic Light Extreme Form will be enough to restrain you!</p>

  <p>Let me see how much longer you can hold out!" The Starry Roc-fish taunted them and increased its attacks.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Once again they heard a strange buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>The downgrader had immensely amplified the Starry Roc-fish's power.</p>

  <p>At that point, the spiral lights became denser. Their collision with the polygonal enchanted barrier, also known as the Polygon Extreme Form, had a strong impact.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng had the ancestry-level bloodline and almost endless supply of energy. Nonetheless, he wanted to break the enchanted barrier with the help of the Magnetic Light Extreme Form. Moreover, he wanted to kill Zheng and Geoffrey within the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Once more, the barrier was bombarded with the spiral lights.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier endured more pressure. It was a good thing that the ancestry-level bloodline worked exceptionally well with the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>With an almost bottomless supply of energy, any cracks that appeared would be instantly repaired. Therefore, they could easily block the Starry Roc-fish's energy.</p>

  <p>"Again! Don't stop until that barrier is completely shattered!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader really pushed the Starry Roc-fish's power to its limit.</p>

  <p>The real Starry Roc-fish curled into a ball within the downgrader's mind.</p>

  <p>It was at a loss for words when it saw what the downgrader did. If the downgrader hadn't taken the time to speak to them slowly, it would have already killed these people. He wouldn't have to exert so much effort now.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish was made out of pure energy. The energy within its body had been accumulated for countless years. But now, the downgrader released all its acquired energy all at once. The Starry Roc-fish felt utterly crest-fallen.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>When the downgrader pushed its power beyond its limits, the five colored lights quickly dimmed. Moreover, the magnetic energy impact became erratic and broken.</p>

  <p>"What?! What just happened?!" the downgrader shouted confusedly.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, all my stored energy has been used up." The Starry Roc-fish sounded dejected and distressed.</p>

  <p>"You are worthless!" the downgrader cursed in anger.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it was obvious that using the Starry Roc-fish against the ancestry-level bloodline was impractical. He failed to prevent Zheng from obtaining the Heavenly Ring Staff. Therefore, he was thoroughly frustrated and furious.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the dimmed Starry Roc-fish. With that, the corners of his mouth curled upwards. "Well, then. It's time for our counterattack."</p>

  <p>He raised the Heavenly Ring Staff and made a gesture. Embarrassed, he lowered the staff and turned around. "How do I use the Heavenly Ring Staff?" he asked Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Just give it orders. It can easily understand," Geoffrey answered.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng nodded. He raised the Heavenly Ring Staff once more and firmly said, "Kill it!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they heard a loud swishing sound.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff began to absorb a massive amount of energy.</p>

  <p>It was just like that particular sword. The stronger its bearer was, the more power it could unleash.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the ancestry-level bloodline could supply it with boundless energy. Therefore, the Heavenly Ring Staff was allowed to display its maximum power.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff released a flash of light. In an instant, dark red cones gathered above Zheng's head. As soon as these cones appeared, they immediately soared towards the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The cones were flying at a breakneck speed. They could easily reach their target.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish noticed that the situation was not favorable. Thus, its soul regained control of its body immediately. With a wave of its tail, it turned around and decided to flee.</p>

  <p>The downgrader didn't stop it. After all, it was entirely his fault that they got into this pinch.</p>

  <p>However, it was far too late for the Starry Roc-fish to escape.</p>

  <p>Those dark red cones looked a little ordinary. But as a matter of fact, they were created through the Pure Energy Extreme Form. Their speed was even faster than that of the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Simultaneously, the cones found their target. dozens of cones shot into the Starry Roc-fish's body.</p>

  <p>With regards to its enormous size, the cones were just as small as thin needles.</p>

  <p>At first, the Starry Roc-fish hoped that the cones weren't too powerful.</p>

  <p>But when the first cone exploded, it immediately knew that it was doomed.</p>

  <p>From afar, Geoffrey and Zheng watched the Starry Roc-fish. It looked like a ball that expanded dozens of times before it cracked and blossomed into a colorful firework.</p>

  <p>In the end, the dot of white light that belonged to the downgrader was unable to escape. It was annihilated along with the Starry Roc-fish.</p>
