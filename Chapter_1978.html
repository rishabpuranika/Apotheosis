<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing the words of the child, the people listening in the universe suddenly realized what had happened.</p>

  <p>The boy was Zheng's son.</p>

  <p>"You bastard!" Maha wore an angry look on his face.</p>

  <p>To mortals, a person who was ninety-two years old already had one foot in the grave.</p>

  <p>However, for martial artists, he was still too young.</p>

  <p>Normally, martial artists would live for thousands, or even tens of thousands of years. Mortals adjudged them to be immortals.</p>

  <p>Besides, those at the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm usually lived for millions of years.</p>

  <p>World lords could live for tens of millions of years, and Supreme Lords could live for hundreds of millions of years.</p>

  <p>With such long lifespans, they were witnesses to the passage of time and the births and deaths of races. To the mortals, these were eternal existences.</p>

  <p>Ninety-two years old.</p>

  <p>For world lords who had lifespans of tens of millions of years, one at the age of ninety-two was like a chick pecking through an eggshell. It had just opened its eyes and stuck out its furry head from the broken eggshell to perceive the world around it.</p>

  <p>In this time, Maha had already trained to the world lord level and had become a genuine Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, his talent could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there were people still more powerful than him.</p>

  <p>In truth, the ten Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe were much younger than Maha, for the conditions for the birth of Godly Geniuses were different between the two universes.</p>

  <p>Right now, Mike was at a critical moment, so he no longer had any qualms. Godly Geniuses, including Zheng, Tianming and Nathan, were the trump cards for his last counterattack.</p>

  <p>If they failed, they would witness the death of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Murphy had not gotten so far. Still, he held the upper hand. There was no need for him to invest his resources into Godly Geniuses. After all, when a Godly Genius like Maha grew up and went to the divine land, he would only become one of his disciples.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Maha was not as highly talented as the ten Godly Geniuses in the universe, but he was still the son of the number one Supreme Lord of the Sacred race. In addition, he was several dozen years older than the ten Godly Geniuses. With the cultivation of the Sacred race, his current strength was truly unmatched. He was only inferior to a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's answer was childish, but his logic was easy to follow.</p>

  <p>Since Maha had offered to fight Zheng and emphasized the word 'fair', then he must do so in an absolutely fair manner.</p>

  <p>But Maha was older than Zheng by over fifty years, and based on age alone, the fight would be unfair.</p>

  <p>When martial artists fought, their ages were not decisive factors in the contest. After all, as they grew up, their circumstances, opportunities, experiences, mentality, and background all exerted important influences.</p>

  <p>The results were dependent on many components.</p>

  <p>It was true that the faster they grew, the more outstanding they were.</p>

  <p>If Zheng refused Maha's invitation, he would appear too weak, greatly disappointing the martial artists and the intelligent creatures of the universe.</p>

  <p>But now, Geoffrey had seen what the problem was. He refused Maha's invitation on behalf of his father. And he was in the right— it was not that his father did not want to fight Maha, but Maha was much older than his father, so the fight was not fair from the outset.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage, one among the Celestial Position martial artists, was listening to all this attentively before a smile surfaced on his stunned face. "Zheng's son is very clever!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. The boy is indeed intelligent. It's a pity that Maha is not willing to give up." Master Feng laughed as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>Because Master Feng was controlling the Evolution Lotus Flower, he was well aware of the momentum that existed in the universe. The momentum could not be seen or touched by others, but he could clearly perceive it as it had been quantified in his Evolution Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had returned with his war declaration, the momentum in the Evolutionary Universe had rapidly risen. Therefore, the Evolution Lotus Flower within the Heavenly Destiny that Master Feng carried had become much stronger.</p>

  <p>Just now, Maha had challenged Zheng to battle via the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>When this news spread throughout the universe, the momentum within the universe began to fluctuate rapidly.</p>

  <p>The momentum could be understood as the morale and confidence of the living beings in the universe.</p>

  <p>When the martial artists, mortals, and intelligent creatures fretted and worried, took on a gloomy view, lost their confidence or suffered a nervous breakdown, the momentum declined. When they regained their confidence and united in their hearts with high morale, the momentum increased.</p>

  <p>Master Feng cared most for Maha's challenge, for the matter directly affected the power of the Heavenly Destiny that he bore.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! I didn't expect you to behave like a coward. You can't even reply directly to my invitation to battle! Instead, you let your eleven-year-old son talk to me. What a joke!" Maha's voice resounded through the universe.</p>

  <p>"Maha, are you deaf? Don't you understand the words of the eleven-year-old boy? With your current strength and status, is it fair to challenge Zheng?" a metallic voice replied back.</p>

  <p>Hearing that voice, Zheng, who was in the Breaking Cloud World was somewhat stunned. He looked Yudie in the eye before saying, "It's Yolande."</p>

  <p>"Agreed! Zheng, a Godly Genius, has just stepped into the world lord level, but you have been a world lord for so many years! How can that be fair?"</p>

  <p>"You're quite shrewd, but also, you're shameless!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Several voices in the universe protested loudly.</p>

  <p>They were all the famous world lords in the universe.</p>

  <p>In spite of not having many Roaring Tokens on hand, they did not hold back in ridiculing Maha.</p>

  <p>Listening to this admonishment, Maha laughed wildly. "Haha, fine. Since you all think it's unfair to challenge Zheng, I will go to the Sunflower Water World and await you all. No matter if you are Supreme Lords or world lords, I challenge you to battle! Would you accept it? I pray you are not gutless cowards!"</p>

  <p>As Master Feng heard this, his face turned stormy.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze dimmed, but he quickly regained his calm.</p>

  <p>Maha's main goal was to suppress the momentum of the universe. No one could stop him. Even if Zheng refused, he could challenge martial artists of the other races instead.</p>

  <p>The words caused the entire universe to sink into silence.</p>

  <p>They were all witnesses to the strength of this Godly Genius of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>During the days when the Sacred race first invaded the universe, Maha used to announce each day which world lords of the Humanity Alliance he had killed.</p>

  <p>He had killed aplenty.</p>

  <p>There were many world lords in the universe, but who would dare to face Maha head on?</p>

  <p>"I wonder who in the universe will dare to accept my challenge!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me, who dares to fight me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure enough, you are a bunch of lowly cowards!"</p>

  <p>Maha continued to use the Roaring Tokens. With these words of ridicule, the momentum in the universe began to diminish.</p>

  <p>The mortals and martial artists stared at each other in deathly silence.</p>

  <p>"Sad. This Godly Genius of the Sacred race is too arrogant. Not a single human among us dares to accept his challenge!"</p>

  <p>"Godly Geniuses are still young, so they won't be willing to get themselves killed. Other than them, are there other talents in the universe?"</p>

  <p>"It's because of the difference in strength. Otherwise, even the Sacred race would not dare to attack us!"</p>

  <p>Dejection was quick to spread through the universe.</p>

  <p>However, Maha's provocation only lasted for a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Among the trillions of creatures of the Evolutionary Universe, some brave men had faced death unflinchingly.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they knew that their strength was inferior to Maha's, but they did not cower in the face of his challenge.</p>

  <p>"I, Alexander Zhao of the Spirit Turtle race, accept your challenge! Let's meet in the Sunflower Water World half a month later!" a hoarse voice said. The first person to come forward was from the Spirit Turtle, a small race. It was little known in the universe and had never had any Supreme Lords. Alexander was the only grand world lord of the race.</p>

  <p>"I, Blair of the ogre race, accept your challenge!"</p>

  <p>The second was Blair, an ogre grand world lord. The ogres were born with wild natures and could not tolerate Maha's provocation. Although they were still at loggerheads with the Demon Night race and were badly in need of powerful talents, Blair resolutely chose to accept the challenge.</p>

  <p>"Yolande from the Humanity Alliance will take your life," Yolande's cold voice sounded out.</p>

  <p>And so, as more and more martial artists responded, the momentum in the universe ascended once again.</p>
