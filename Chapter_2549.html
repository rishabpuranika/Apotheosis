  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sound of shoe soles roughly scraping the ground filled the area as the four of them had run for more than 300 miles in the wilderness, then they came to a halt.</p>

  <p>"This is the place," said Sarah with a smile. "This area should be the place with the most abundant wild bones in the Immemorial Wilderness."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the squirrel on Amos' shoulder let out a squeak.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, it might've sensed the rich Wild God Power in the place.</p>

  <p>In turn, Amos vigilantly scanned the whole place and said, "There are indeed a lot of wild bones here, but it's not safe here."</p>

  <p>The area in the Immemorial Wilderness where they were in wasn't really small, but it was likely that they could still encounter people from the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods who came into this area in the Immemorial Wilderness all thought that their survival was their most important priority, not the number of wild bones they could get.</p>

  <p>After all, the Admission Tokens to enter the place were not of much value, but everyone had only one life.</p>

  <p>"It's not a big problem. This is not the core area of the Immemorial Wilderness. I doubt that the elites of the Yellow Emperor race would take the risk and come over," said Hiram. He, too, was interested in the huge amount of wild bones in the place.</p>

  <p>Although they were all generally cautious and careful people, it was a huge risk for them to come to this area.</p>

  <p>"Just be quick," Sarah said with a faint smile as she looked helplessly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone had been watching Luo Zheng dig up the wild bones for most of the time, up until now.</p>

  <p>The number of wild bones he got alone was probably more than the total number of wild bones the three of them had dug up. It was safe to say that he had a really big advantage.</p>

  <p>Yet, he didn't know much about this part of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>He simply began to search for the wild bones quietly by spreading out his spiritual will like a net that covered a radius of several dozen miles.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, eight thousand miles away from them was Romeo of the Nine Li race who floated in the air.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in white and his calm exterior exuded a faint aura. He looked like a man who came from the scroll.</p>

  <p>Surrounding him were the eight Wild Gods who had grown up to eight thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>"I'm a little surprised. When did you guys have the guts to come to this core area of the Immemorial Wilderness to dig wild bones?" Romeo asked.</p>

  <p>It was known that this specific area in the Immemorial Wilderness served as the training grounds for the Nine Li race and Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>The training for the core disciples of both sides included recklessly killing each other's unimportant Wild Gods, which was why all the unimportant Wild Gods tried their best to avoid Romeo and the likes of him when they dug wild bones.</p>

  <p>It was also why very few Wild Gods went to the core area to search for wild bones--it was tantamount to death.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Romeo was very surprised to encounter eight unimportant Wild Gods of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>The eight Wild Gods seemed to be well prepared. They didn't escape when they saw Romeo, but activated the Wild God Power in an attempt to fight back.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods looked fierce and ready to fight, and they didn't bother to hide the obvious greed in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Killing a disciple of the Nine Li race could get us a million wild bones!"</p>

  <p>"And also a set of Yellow Emperor's blood!"</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap. Let's get ready to fight!"</p>

  <p>Romeo was surprised to hear them.</p>

  <p>"There will always be brave men in search of great rewards," as the saying went. A million wild bones were not enough to make those Wild Gods take the risk.</p>

  <p>To get a set of Yellow Emperor blood, however? The temptation was too great.</p>

  <p>Cultivation in this world did not require too much talent, but it was the bloodline that made the big difference.</p>

  <p>Those with special bloodlines were able to absorb the power in the wild bones that contained bloodlines and activate bloodline token. In other words, Wild Gods with blood token were much more powerful than ordinary Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Yet, bloodline was something that was assigned from birth--and countless people dreamed of changing their bloodlines.</p>

  <p>Some great races could indeed transplant their bloodline to other Wild Gods, but they couldn't possibly transplant their bloodline randomly if they wanted to maintain the purity of their own bloodline.</p>

  <p>For example, the Nine Li race had only offered their bloodline to about a dozen outsiders, and all of them had made great contribution to the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Thus, the fact that Yellow Emperor race suddenly offered such a reward shocked Romeo greatly.</p>

  <p>Just then, it seemed that eight huge mountains were about to surround Romeo as the Wild Gods ran straight towards him!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>A violent gust of wind blew as their massive bodies rushed down to pounce on him.</p>

  <p>In response, his eyes glittered and his smile faded away, only to be replaced by an icy glare.</p>

  <p>He quickly swept past the Wild Gods like an agile fish and at the same time, a light green bamboo sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Nine Li Wild Body!"</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>After he had activated the Wild God Power in his body, his figure began to expand until he quickly became a giant that was ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>His giant's form however, was very different from that of ordinary Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Another huge head appeared above Romeo's head. The new head was a duplicate of Romeo's head but it looked ferocious and aggressive.</p>

  <p>In addition, there were another two hands that appeared on his body!</p>

  <p>Two heads and four hands!</p>

  <p>It turned out to be the bloodline token of the Nine Li race!</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, one who had absorbed enough blood wild bones would be able to grow two additional heads and four additional arms.</p>

  <p>When Romeo's body expanded, the bamboo sword in his hand turned into a huge sword that was eight thousand feet long as well!</p>

  <p>At that point, his two heads began to speak at the same time. "You're... courting death!" he said softly.</p>

  <p>However, both of them had different voices.</p>

  <p>The first one was calm and aloof, while the other seemed very angry. It sounded quite strange when the two of them spoke simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The moment Romeo turned into a giant Wild God, he stretched out two of his hands and dragged a Wild God towards him. Then, he stabbed the Wild God's head with the bamboo sword.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>The bamboo sword was so sharp that it completely penetrated the Wild God's head to his body!</p>

  <p>But Romeo didn't stop there--he turned around and punched two more Wild Gods. Then, he twisted his body, pulled out the bamboo sword, and slashed at them.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The green sword light swept through the space of tens of thousands of feet all around and along the necks of three Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Three giant heads rolled down the Wild Gods' bodies and hit the ground with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>Romeo had brought his four arms and two heads into full play, which made it impossible for his opponents to dodge his attacks. The Wild Gods were about as huge as Romeo's form, but they actually couldn't fight back and only retreated.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had killed all the eight Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>"You've overestimated yourselves!" Romeo's two heads said together.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the eight corpses, which had now shrunken.</p>

  <p>Yet, he also felt a little dubious. He wondered, why did the Yellow Emperor race offer such a reward for this group of trash to kill the warriors of the Nine Li race?</p>

  <p>Are they going to wage an all-out war?</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, his eyes subconsciously drifted over to the tall, huge Sky South Bone Tower in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race had been enemies for a long time. Romeo had heard from the elders of his race that even in the Source World, the two races were like water and fire as they could not tolerate each other.</p>

  <p>Still, they lived in a world where they had to set aside their hatred in order to survive.</p>

  <p>The fight that happened in this area in the Immemorial Wilderness was all for the Sky South Bone Tower. He wondered, was the Yellow Emperor race prepared to seize the Sky South Bone Tower?</p>
