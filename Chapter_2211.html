<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng wanted to explain the problem of his Godly Tile to Mae, he was unable to do so.</p>

  <p>He knew that it would be easier for him to condense his Godly Tile if he practiced the life vitality system.</p>

  <p>He could choose any one of the Divine Dao and condense the internal momentum he had comprehended into a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>But since he practiced the Primal Chaos Technique, it would be a gigantic task for him to condense a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng played a huge gamble on his part when he acquired the strange mud.</p>

  <p>But he knew he had to get it in order to condense the Godly Tile. Even though only a small part of it was condensed, he knew that he took the right decision. He was worried what might happen if he couldn't find this kind of mud again.</p>

  <p>Yazid was in awe and shock when he saw Luo Luo Zheng release the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way without much effort. He stared at Luo Luo Zheng silently, memorizing his appearance, and then took off, making his way towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Mae grinned from ear to ear when she saw a furious Yazid leaving. She said to Bentley, "I guess the Heavenly Han House must have clashed with Yazid. Otherwise, you won't let this young man go with me."</p>

  <p>Bentley shook his head in dismay. "Forget it. Mae, you had a long and arduous journey. Get some rest and you'd feel better."</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," she said. She had all her interest on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She circled Luo Luo Zheng, without taking her eyes off him. "Most of Master Joy's disciples are females, and there are only three male disciples. I did not expect that she would have another male disciple."</p>

  <p>'What? I am not looking for a new master!' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng craved to enter the Floating Island. But he had no plans to acquire a new master; he already had one.</p>

  <p>Mae was quite good at reading people's minds. "You don't want to be Master Joy's disciple?" she asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Joy was quite famous as a Demi-holy Being in the divine land. Only the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan outranked her on the clan's Floating Island. Joy had plans of her own. She wanted to set up her own sect and create her own Floating Island. Many True Gods sought for Joy so that they might get enlisted as her disciples.</p>

  <p>Mae was unaware of the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had a master and he wasn't looking for another.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that even if Bromley was here in person, he wouldn't be able to teach him anything. After all, he was cultivating the chaotic energy system. He was aware of the fact that Joy was practicing the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"I am not looking for a master as I already have one," Luo Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Mae smiled at his words.</p>

  <p>She acknowledged that Luo Luo Zheng was indeed gifted, but he was just a proving godly warrior who had struggled in a small divine city. She wondered how his master could be superior to Joy, who was a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng kept on insisting that he was in no need for a new master.</p>

  <p>Mae was very subtle. "Joining us doesn't necessarily mean being Master Joy's disciple. It's not easy to become her disciple. It could be possible that she might not want you as her disciple," she said. She knew that Luo Luo Zheng would make the right choice, nonetheless.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't say much now that Mae had said so. What he only wanted was to enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Mae stayed in the Heavenly Han House for two days.</p>

  <p>Bentley agreed on letting Luo Luo Zheng leave with Mae. He made some sort of pact with Mae, without telling Luo Luo Zheng much about it. Although, Luo Luo Zheng knew that the Heavenly Han House suffered losses and Joy would make up for the losses.</p>

  <p>Then, came the day when Luo Luo Zheng packed up all his belongings and left the Six-Burden Divine City, Mae beside him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's talents lay no bounds. After staying at the Heavenly Han House for few months, he was finally able to achieve his dream of entering the Floating Island. The news of him entering the Floating Island spread like wildfire, and once again, everyone in Six-Burden Divine City started talking about him. Yet, his origin was still suspicious.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House figured that Luo Zheng's identity was quite suspicious and at the peril of discovery; therefore, they took necessary measures to further strengthen his fake identity and his secret was stored away for good.</p>

  <p>Mae invited Luo Luo Zheng to the giant purple flower. She smiled as she saw him approaching her. Then together, they made their way towards the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The purple flower was Mae's own creation. She built it with the help of the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way. It was a large space treasure filled with vast space inside. However, the gap between the space within the purple flower and the Purple Sky Land was too huge.</p>

  <p>Once inside this precious flower, Luo Luo Zheng was unaware of what was happening outside, though he could feel that the flower was moving rapidly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt quite dreary during his time in the flower, and Mae rarely visited him. He felt as if he was wasting his talents away in here.</p>

  <p>There was no point for him to continue cultivating. He had already reached the limit of being a proving godly warrior and he could go no further. He only wished to condense the Godly Tile, which was his biggest hold-up.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had nothing better to do, he went through the Divine Dao in the Infinity Ruler repeatedly in his mind. He was aware of the different types of Divine Dao, each having different characteristics. He knew that if used with great care and skill, they would be able to showcase extraordinary results.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stuck inside the flower for about two months, each day proving more monotonous than the previous one.</p>

  <p>One day, Luo Luo Zheng felt as if the flower was descending, and much to his delight, it really was. Then, it was brought to an abrupt halt. He then heard Mae's voice telling him that they had reached their destination.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't contain his excitement as he headed outside of the purple flower. What he saw next filled him with wonder; he saw a vast colorful sea which appeared to be boundless. The various colors of the sea intertwined with one another. There was a lasting momentum within this sea, which surrounded the darkness of the world.</p>

  <p>"It's beautiful!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>It was a sea of magnificent colors.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng noticed how vast the sea was. He observed that the water was not ordinary; rather it was colorful. Waves swept over like colorful rainbow, which was a sight for sore eyes.</p>

  <p>"I believe it is the Time Sea, right?" Luo Luo Zheng wondered out loud.</p>

  <p>Mae nodded. Seeing Luo Luo Zheng so excited made her happy.</p>

  <p>People who lived on the Floating Islands, could visit the Time Sea any time they wanted, but many proving godly warriors and even True Gods had never seen it in their lives.</p>

  <p>Whoever saw the Time Sea for the first time would be captivated by its beauty, and the soothing colorful waves hit them like a warm summer breeze.</p>

  <p>As for Mae, the Time Sea was no stranger, as she was born on the Floating Island. But to the very this day, she was still charmed by its wonder.</p>

  <p>"It might be the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>He heaved a sigh of admiration. A mysterious Mu Ning seemed to hover above the Time Sea. He was captivated by this Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>He felt as if the sea was calling him, asking him to step into the water.</p>

  <p>He spaced out, lost in his thoughts and started making his way towards the sea.</p>

  <p>Mae sprang into action when she saw Luo Luo Zheng approaching the sea. She stepped in front of him and asked sternly, "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"I just want to see the sea water," Luo Luo Zheng said absentmindedly. His eyes were transfixed upon the Time Sea. He felt complete and had this strange yet wonderful feeling as if he was home. He felt one with the sea and had a strong urge to go into its water.</p>

  <p>Mae was watching Luo Luo Zheng closely. "The Time Sea is quite dangerous," she said sternly. "I would be in great danger if I went into its water and so would you be."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had this confused yet blank expression on his face. Mae patiently explained that the Time Sea wasn't at all what it looked like. She lay out the fact that what looked like water wasn't actually water but rather fragments of time. "The Time Sea records whatever happened in the history, and turns it into countless fragments. If you touch one of the fragments, you would fall into that certain time period," she explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't quite comprehend what he was hearing. "So I can travel to any stage of the divine land through the Time Sea?" he asked excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a bit complicated than that. These are fragments of time and not a complete time passage. So when you fell into the sea, you would also be split into countless pieces and fall into different periods of time.</p>

  <p>So falling into the sea means death; believe me!" Mae warned.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback when he heard this. A look of horror crept onto his face. "Why did all the wealthy clans establish Floating Islands here, knowing that this place is quite dangerous?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in an alarming tone.</p>

  <p>"That's because the Ruling Slate is here," Mae replied calmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still a little puzzled. The Ruling Slate was here didn't seem to have anything to do with the fact that those wealthy clans had built Floating Islands here. He still had a lot of questions, but he didn't want to annoy Mae. So he just shrugged and said nothing.</p>
