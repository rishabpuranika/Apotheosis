<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The report had all the Oneness Sky Palace warriors confused.</p>

  <p>"Did you use the wrong Sanskrit word?" Auden asked.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head and affirmatively said, "It's impossible. I've checked it carefully and confirmed that the Sanskrit word on the flying ship is correct."</p>

  <p>"Could it be that someone made a mistake when recording the Sanskrit word before?" Pearce guessed.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As the space fluctuated, Winchell's figure appeared before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>His face seemed serious as he said, "It's impossible. Even if there is something wrong with the flying ship of the Oneness Mountain, there couldn't be something wrong with the ship of the Origin Mountain at the same time. And even if something is wrong with both mountains, what about the flying ship of the Golden Mountain?"</p>

  <p>Both the Origin Mountain and the Golden Mountain had just made an attempt, but the two flying ships were blocked outside the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>"Why is this happening?" A strong warrior from the Oneness Sky Palace asked.</p>

  <p>"There's only one possibility," Winchell said, raising his dashing eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Someone modified the Sanskrit word on the boundary wall."</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>"But that's the boundary wall..."</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of anyone who can actually modify it!"</p>

  <p>The wall served as the dividing line between the two provinces? a unique product of the Source World.</p>

  <p>The ordinary mortals and even many of the True Gods didn't have the ability to cross through several provinces. But such a task was a piece of cake for the powerful warriors of various large races. A long time ago, they had already gathered all the Sanskrit words within all the boundary walls of the Source World.</p>

  <p>To visit a particular province, one only needed to show the corresponding Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and have a look!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Pearce finished speaking, his figure disappeared from where he stood. The next moment, he appeared before the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Stretching out his hand, he gently punched it, releasing a Sanskrit word corresponding to the one that had already appeared on the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The two words failed to react to each other, and no passageway appeared on the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Auden, Athemar, Goran, and the rest also moved over. But Pearce's failed attempt made all their faces fall grim.</p>

  <p>They believed that something must be wrong, especially at this critical moment.</p>

  <p>"Well, since we can't use the normal method to pass through the wall, let's break it," Winchell suggested.</p>

  <p>While the Separate Amber Province was a small province, it was no easy task to break its boundary wall.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to do so, they had to first reach the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>But while these warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace present hadn't yet reached that realm, they were at the Holy Soul Realm and had already fused with the Chaotic Source Spirits. With joint effort, they figured they could break the wall down.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, destroying the boundary wall was considered taboo.</p>

  <p>While these crystal-like boundary walls would still recover after decades, no one dared to break them unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>"Let's do it, then," Auden said decisively.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he had nothing to worry about. The moment he finished speaking, the Other Shore Tokens in the bodies of Pearce, Goran, Athemar, and the rest began moving as their power accumulated.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to shatter the wall, the crystal surface suddenly flashed with a circle of light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The next moment, the entire boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province turned pitch black.</p>

  <p>An enormous figure was projected on the wall in front of Pearce.</p>

  <p>It was a human teenager.</p>

  <p>With raven hair and eyes, he was rather handsome.</p>

  <p>But that didn't make him seem good-natured, as there was a sinister look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to break this wall," he said with an almost evil smile.</p>

  <p>His figure was somewhat illusory, as though it was coming from the wall or the sky.</p>

  <p>"Take action!" Pearce shouted out.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, including Auden, Athemar, and Goran, all made their move.</p>

  <p>While they knew it was no simple task they were trying to do, all of them were highly determined people, capable of remaining composed at critical moments like this.</p>

  <p>Regardless, they intended to break the boundary wall first.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>Streaks of sword radiance hit the wall, making the surrounding space start fluctuating violently.</p>

  <p>The raven-haired boy merely pointed in front of him, making a stable pattern appear both in front of him and in the inner layer of the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>The pattern seemed to be a great spider web, and it could evenly distribute the power within a certain range onto the entire boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>In essence, it was also a means of energy transfer, and just so happened to be the boy's ability.</p>

  <p>The joint attack of about seven powerful warriors from the Oneness Sky Palace was equal to the full attack of an Eternal Realm master? it was probably enough to blow out a great hole in the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>But because of the spider web's existence, the boundary wall didn't budge an inch.</p>

  <p>"How weak," said the boy with disdain. "It's impossible to even test my strength."</p>

  <p>Once he finished speaking, he disappeared from the wall.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, a thin crack appeared above the boundary wall, opening like two doors. From there, three giant flying ships slowly emerged.</p>

  <p>On the first was engraved the words, 'Bearing race'. Atop the ship was a man dressed in luxury clothes. He was none other than Yellow Thearch, the leader of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>With Yellow Thearch as the center, a grand aura was released.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely penetrating aura. Even as the seven giant flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace were guarded by many arrays, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were still suppressed by the aura.</p>

  <p>"Whose aura is so powerful?"</p>

  <p>"Did we get into trouble?"</p>

  <p>"I knew this trip would not be that simple..."</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace disciples' faces darkened.</p>

  <p>In the center of the Oneness Mountain's giant ship, three great red crystals were placed side by side. Inside them were the physical bodies of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and Zheng.</p>

  <p>This area was heavily guarded. Under the enchanted barrier's protection, not even a mosquito could get in and out.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Soul City, Feng Ge found that her mother had taken her on the flying ship. Knowing that both Zheng and the Oneness Sky Palace were in great danger, she wasn't in the mood to receive any training in the Soul City, even though she wasn't far from reaching the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"If only Zheng could wake up in advance..."</p>

  <p>Across the red crystal, Feng Ge could see Zheng's peaceful face? it was like he was merely asleep.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you say if only your father could wake up?" Flamine said with a smile.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Feng Ge bluntly said, "Even if Father wakes up, he might not be able to protect the Oneness Sky Palace, but Zheng can."</p>

  <p>As Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter, she had gone too far by saying such words. After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was taking charge of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>But what she said was true? with how the situation was turning out, the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't get out of trouble merely by relying on Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Flamine could see right through her daughter, but she just smiled helplessly in return. Before she could respond, she and Feng Ge both felt a vast, strong aura from outside the flying ship.</p>

  <p>Concerned, Flamine stretched out her hand and hit the air. The scene outside the flying ship appeared on the surface of the crystal wall nearby.</p>

  <p>The moment they saw the Bearing race's flying ship, their faces turned grim.</p>
