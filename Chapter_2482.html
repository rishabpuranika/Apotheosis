<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The cocoon of light instantly entered directly between Luo Zheng's eyebrows, and immediately disappeared, leaving no trace behind.</p>

  <p>After being planted with the cocoon of light, Luo Zheng had an unexplainable strange feeling in the pit of his heart. The bizarre feeling touched him to his very core.</p>

  <p>Back then, he had also been planted with a petal by Estelle. This time, he was planted with a cocoon of light.</p>

  <p>Would the cocoon of light really record all his actions?</p>

  <p>As the long-haired woman retracted her hands and smiled, he quickly felt a sense of relief wash over him.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps this is how a family feels, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. I'll take you to get Harper's inheritance," stated the long-haired woman as she took Yan in her arms.</p>

  <p>It was then that Reinhard and the Sword Clan disciples suddenly rushed over.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the long-haired woman had killed Edmond not long ago, Reinhard was still worried about Luo Zheng and Yan. He couldn't help it.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, any kind of incarnation of fear was an enemy. The long-haired woman gave people a weird, indescribable feeling. Could she be a fiend that had the capacity to bewitch people?</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, tell me, who is she? Do you know?" Reinhard asked, his voice shaking with nerves.</p>

  <p>His reaction was completely understandable.</p>

  <p>One couldn't forget that Edmond had been killed with just one single move on her behalf.</p>

  <p>Even if every single one of them joined together and fought back, there still wouldn't be any point. But how could Reinhard ever feel at ease if he didn't figure it out.</p>

  <p>Since having activated the Calamity Sword, he was doomed to his death.</p>

  <p>That said, he still had hopes that Yan and Luo Zheng could escape the disaster and obtain the skeleton's inheritance.</p>

  <p>"She..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stuttered as he hesitated for a moment, unsure of how exactly to answer his question.</p>

  <p>The long-haired woman bit her lips and stared at Luo Zheng with her demonic red eyes, a hint of expectation clearly visible on her face.</p>

  <p>Of course she hoped that Luo Zheng would admit that she was his mother!</p>

  <p>Wasn't it only normal for her to feel that way?</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's eyes met those of the long-haired woman, his heart skipped a beat and he immediately said, "She's my mother."</p>

  <p>As she heard him respond, the long-haired woman narrowed her eyes and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your...your mother?! What?!" Reinhard was stunned. He couldn't believe what he'd just heard.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan looked at each other in disbelief. They couldn't believe it either.</p>

  <p>It was really unimaginable. After all, the incarnations of fears here in the debate venue were all extremely horrible and had unique appearances.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng have met his mother here?</p>

  <p>No matter how coincidental it appeared, it was simply too outlandish for it actually be a coincidence.</p>

  <p>'No. Perhaps she's still a fiend capable of bewitching others. Maybe this woman is from the Soul Wilderness, and there are indeed a few powerful creatures who have such capacities!' Reinhard pondered silently.</p>

  <p>As he noticed the confusion and disbelief on Reinhard's face, Luo Zheng couldn't restrain himself from explaining further. "In fact, it shouldn't be hard to understand that my mother had also become my fear for a certain period. At that time though, I didn't know she is my mother."</p>

  <p>It was then that Reinhard and the other Sword Clan members realized what was going on. Despite understanding, they were at a loss on whether they should laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan was willing to sacrifice their disciple, Duke, who summoned a fiend to kill both Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on his belalf, was considered even stranger, as he had just called out his own mother.</p>

  <p>Deep inside himself, Reinhard sighed heavily. 'The members of the Luo Clan, aside from Yan of course, all seem to be a little weird, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see. That's good," Reinhard said flatly with a forced smile.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! You must be capable of obtaining the inheritance now."</p>

  <p>Although the Sword Clan disciples had completed their mission, their lives would soon come to an end.</p>

  <p>The blood lines on Reinhard's and other Sword Clan disciples' Calamity Swords became shorter and shorter, little by little. Now, only an approximate one fifth of the blood lines remained at the top of the sword tips.</p>

  <p>By the time the blood lines became completely extinct, their lives would be over. It was as simple as that.</p>

  <p>It was only inevitable that the other ten Sword Clan disciples also became depressed when they realized this.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, in order to fight to the death, they had recklessly used their Calamity Swords. The time to suffer now came.</p>

  <p>They had prepared themselves mentally for this event. However, life and death were two very different things, and neither were easy to face.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with you guys?"</p>

  <p>Looking at Reinhard's and the Sword Clan disciples' facial expressions, Luo Zheng was somewhat baffled. He indeed couldn't believe his own two eyes.</p>

  <p>In their hands, he stared blankly at the long swords. Then again, these eleven people from the Sword Clan had just demonstrated their powerful strength. It was so incredible, in fact, that they had actually caused damage to Edmond twice. Could it have something to do with the swords in their hands?</p>

  <p>As the long-haired woman saw what Luo Zheng was looking at, she smiled faintly. She immediately handed the sleeping Yan over to her son.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had his sister firmly in his grasp, the woman immediately walked toward Reinhard and grabbed the Calamity Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>She said indifferently, "Your swords are formed by tides of misfortune.</p>

  <p>Once the red lines dissipate, you'll face three crises and three calamities.</p>

  <p>However, the vast majority of people can't even survive through the first crisis. And if, by chance, you do survive the first crisis, then there will be a second, and a third. Followed still by three calamities. Let's face it.</p>

  <p>You'll surely die."</p>

  <p>"What? I don't understand!" Luo Zheng's eyes parted slightly. 'They sacrificed their lives to protect me and Yan?!' he wondered, in complete disbelief.</p>

  <p>With a bitter smile, Reinhard yanked his Calamity Sword back from the woman. "Before using the Calamity Swords, we were already well aware of the consequences. This is our fate. And I'm afraid that isn't anything we can change."</p>

  <p>The other Sword Clan disciples equally lowered their heads with grief etched on their faces.</p>

  <p>Once a Calamity Sword was used, redeeming it was completely impossible, even for a Holy Being. Its official use was acknowledged by the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>"I remember the Calamity Swords were created by a talent from your Sword Clan. They are actually Misfortune Swords that come from the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Although the three crises and three calamities are unshakable, they can still be shifted over to someone else," the long-haired woman stated.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean they can be shifted over to someone else?"</p>

  <p>Reinhard's heart was pounding fast and hard in his chest.</p>

  <p>Of course, he had no idea where Luo Zheng's mother had come from. What he did know though, was that someone like her probably held a few unbelievable abilities that even certain Holy Beings didn't possess.</p>

  <p>"Did you say they could be transferred?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying we still have the chance to live?"</p>

  <p>"This is impossible! Even Master Marsh would be unable to do that!"</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan disciples suddenly looked hopeful, and the group suddenly appeared more energetic.</p>

  <p>"Who will we transfer the three crises and three calamities to, though?"</p>

  <p>Solomon asked at once. He was already thinking ahead.</p>

  <p>As they heard him speak, everyone fell silent.</p>

  <p>Who in their right mind would be willing to sacrifice themselves to suffer the three crises and three calamities of others?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, turned on his heel and gazed at someone standing not too far off.</p>

  <p>The others also looked in the same direction.</p>

  <p>In the distance, they could see Duke, who didn't seem to have returned from his state of great shock.</p>

  <p>At the moment, he was in a daze. With his hair down, he didn't have the visual quality of a top-rank True God whatsoever.</p>

  <p>He stared blankly at the flesh and bones piled up on the ground with a face full of grief. It was almost as if Edmond was his masterpiece, and that someone had actually dared break it.</p>

  <p>"Duke!" someone called out excitedly.</p>

  <p>"We can transfer the three crises and three calamities to him!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Bring him here!" another agreed.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan disciples looked at Duke as if they had just seen their life-saver.</p>

  <p>Duke was indeed still stuck in a stupor. It took him a good moment before noticing the Sword Clan disciples rushing toward him. He was startled back to his senses, and his only desire was to run away as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>However, he was been hit by Edmond once earlier and had been seriously injured.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan disciples' Calamity Swords were still powerful enough to deal with him. Did Duke really think he'd get away now?</p>

  <p>It wasn't before long that the Sword Clan members tied Duke and carried him to the woman with long hair.</p>

  <p>Reinhard still felt a little worried. "Can the three crises and three calamities of every single one of us really be shifted over onto one person? One person alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they can. You'll individually have to stab the swords into his body.</p>

  <p>However, you'll have to do so without killing him," the long-haired woman replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan disciples looked at Duke with malicious eyes.</p>

  <p>"What...what do you want from me? What do you want to do to me?!"</p>

  <p>Duke shouted fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Our swordsmanship is excellent. We won't kill you. It'll only hurt a little!" Reinhard laughed.</p>
