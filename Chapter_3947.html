<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Within the blink of an eye, the golden fish swam across the Divine River with such finesse that they disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>But the blood from the bottom remained on the surface of the river for a fair amount of time.</p>

  <p>For the races on the shores, it seemed to be an experience they'd gotten used to over time. The creatures that had just crawled out of the water dived right back in without any visible reluctance.</p>

  <p>"Do they not fear the Golden Bites?" Luo Zheng asked with apparent confusion reflecting from his face as he looked at the creatures in the Divine River.</p>

  <p>The creatures residing in the Flaming Maple Forest were quite compelling, but the Golden Bites could easily tear them apart limb from limb. Their sheer brute strength was enough to send chills down their spines.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Golden Bites were out of sight, they crawled back into the Divine River. They were fearless.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! The Golden Bites won't come back. They eat anything, but they will only go all the way to the lower reaches from the upper reaches in flocks. After a flock of Golden Bites leave, the Divine River will become much safer," King Ieuan explained while maintaining a steady eye contact with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The creatures on the shores weren't the only ones whose existence was threatened by the Golden Bites. The fierce beasts in the Divine River too were powerless against them, and would end up getting devoured.</p>

  <p>Therefore, every time they passed through the Divine River, it would be free of the usual threats. Many creatures would take this opportunity to find some treasures in the Divine River.</p>

  <p>"Why don't we take this opportunity to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Ying?" Luo Zheng said with determination oozing from his tone.</p>

  <p>The reason why he came to the Flaming Maple Forest was to rescue Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying. Since the two of them were trapped in the Divine River, and it was safe to enter it at this time, it was a favorable situation for him.</p>

  <p>After scanning its surroundings by running its gaze all around, King Ieuan squeaked, "Don't be hasty. Let me go and check it out first."</p>

  <p>Upon saying that, it quietly walked up to the Divine River and dived into it.</p>

  <p>The speed at which it swam was insanely fast. It was hard to keep track of its movements. Within a flash, it reached the other end of the river. It was quickly out of sight after going down a distance along the other side.</p>

  <p>Stationed at the lower reaches of the Divine River were more than ten creatures to guard that place. They were given strict orders to arrest Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying on sight.</p>

  <p>At least, that was what the outsiders heard.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Jin Wu bore ill intentions against the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Their biggest priority was to annihilate both Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying and erase their existence from the world.</p>

  <p>Killing two Eternal Realm warriors on the Other Shore was far less arduous compared to doing it in the chaos.</p>

  <p>To follow through with their plans, the Xuanyuan requested the assistance of the Element Spirit Civilization. He had asked Mahoney to lure Ying to the Divine River to finish her off. However, it never occurred to them that Ying would escape from their clutches and head to the bottom of the Divine River.</p>

  <p>Although Ying and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had successfully foiled the attempt to assassinate them, they were unable to return to the Taiyi Heaven Palace because they were soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water. Even though they hadn't taken them down for good, the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer had achieved their purpose in keeping them away from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Taking advantage of the situation, the Jin Wu went ahead and launched a full-blown attack on the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Due to the surprise attack and their lowered defenses, the Taiyi Heaven Palace faced difficulty in defending themselves against the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Since they were caught off guard, there was no time for Li Shan mountain to act fast and reinforce them.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Luo Zheng appeared and released the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi to turn the situation in their favor.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Jin Wu experienced a massive setback, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying were no longer of any value.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization didn't even take Fuxi and the Snake Goddess seriously, let alone Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying, who were only at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>That was why only three people were tasked to guard the place, and the others were transferred to other places one after another.</p>

  <p>Then, after their battle raged on with Li Shan mountain, the Element Spirit Civilization decided to send more people to guard this place as an added precaution. However, this time, they had a switch of intentions. Instead of wanting to capture Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying, they were asked to wait for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Flaming Maple Forest was not the territory of the Element Spirit Civilization, so they could only send a limited number of spies there.</p>

  <p>Additionally, King Ieuan was always sharp on its toes. Its cautious nature kept Luo Zheng and his group hidden away, avoiding all sorts of unwanted attention. However, it all went down the drain soon after they passed through the open space of the forest.</p>

  <p>A hairy creature immediately rushed over to his friends to inform them of his latest discovery. "Some humans have arrived."</p>

  <p>The name of their leader was Norris. Visually, he was a towering figure with an incredible height of fifty feet. His skin was of a thick cyan color, and his appearance overall gave off the impression of a wild ancient beast with low intelligence yet infinite reserves of strength.</p>

  <p>"Humans? Are they the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer?" Norris furrowed his brows as he asked.</p>

  <p>Despite his daunting presence and overwhelming size, his tone reflected calmness with a touch of elegance.</p>

  <p>Norris was a tyrant in the Grand Pure Realm. After facing loss at the hands of the Eye Spirit, he had devoted his life to following his orders obediently.</p>

  <p>Using his authority over him, the Eye Spirit sent him here to capture Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Staying loyal to the Eye Spirit, Norris reassured the success of the task that was given to him. He was going to make sure Luo Zheng would not leave the Flaming Maple Forest alive.</p>

  <p>"I'm familiar with the auras of the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer," the reporter answered. "But the auras of those people are different from theirs. They're quite strange."</p>

  <p>As those words reached his ears, a gleam of light flashed through the pupils of Norris' eyes.</p>

  <p>Right now, there were very few humans at the Eternal Realm. Besides the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer, only those from the Li Shan mountain could be these humans.</p>

  <p>"It seems the prey has finally shown itself." Norris suddenly stood up and said to the creatures beside him, "You three continue to guard this place.</p>

  <p>The others follow me!"</p>

  <p>After assigning everyone their duties, he dashed towards the open space in the forest with about eight creatures following closely behind.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to them, a small black head appeared on the surface of the Divine River. It was King Ieuan. As soon as it arrived, it witnessed the entire scene and caught wind of their malicious intentions. Shocked by the sudden discovery, it dived into the river once again and swam its way back to the upper reaches.</p>

  <p>Previously, it swam downstream at an incredible pace to scope the area out for Luo Zheng. But now, as it swam upstream, its speed had decreased drastically.</p>

  <p>It was visibly slower than Norris and his men.</p>

  <p>However, the Divine River was in the shape of a funnel, and Norris and his men were far away in terms of distance.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Norris was swiftly closing the distance between himself and the open space in the forest, King Ieuan emerged from the river and shouted,</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Luo Zheng, quickly retreat from this place. They are coming!"</p>

  <p>When King Ieuan's warning reached their ears, all three of them displayed expression of depression.</p>

  <p>As they walked with quick steps and with their gazes fixated on the ground, three huge creatures suddenly appeared in front of them and blocked their path. They belonged to the Misty River race, and the leader was Larkin.</p>

  <p>As Larkin eyed them up with disgust, a malicious smirk appeared on his face. "I forgot something. The guy from the Element Spirit race has told me that I would be rewarded handsomely if I were to catch you."</p>

  <p>Most of the good things in the Three Purities Stage had fallen into the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization, and they always fulfilled every promise they made. Although the Misty River race and the Element Spirit Civilization didn't usually get along, they could still work together if it involved their mutual interest.</p>

  <p>"Retreat from the Other Shore! Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan shouted loudly again to remind them of the approaching calamity. However, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Luo Zheng remained rooted in their respective spots as they were forced into a dead end.</p>

  <p>The three didn't have any time to process their next move. In a moment of desperation, they chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune, and their bodies blurred as they withdrew from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Breaking Rune was also a kind of energy. When the Flaming Maple Forest felt this energy, it immediately reacted to it in response.</p>

  <p>Countless maple leaves flashed and flew over, but the three of them had disappeared on the Other Shore before the maple leaves could explode, so they remained unharmed.</p>

  <p>Seeing the prey escape from the Other Shore right under his nose, Larkin became furious. "Catch that damn mouse!"</p>

  <p>Even after the three escaped, Norris remained calm and showed no signs of frustration. He secretly made a gesture to the creatures under his command, and behind him, three of them jumped into the Divine River to capture King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>Norris calmly walked over to the place where Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi had disappeared. He wore a pensive expression on his face as he examined his surroundings.</p>

  <p>There was a way to forcefully drag the creatures on the Other Shore back to the Source World. In the past, Concubine Yan had planned to drag Feng Ge back, but she was unsuccessful in her attempt.</p>

  <p>Norris, on the other hand, had a way to forcefully drag the creatures from the chaos back to the Other Shore.</p>
