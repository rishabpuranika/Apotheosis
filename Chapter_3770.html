<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3770 Bone Island </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The white bone boat floated on the blue ocean.</p>

  <p>It was rowed manually by the bone slaves, so it did not move too fast.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng possessed the ability to fly and could do so across the ocean, or even help the bone slaves speed up if he wished.</p>

  <p>But the Primeval Lord of Heaven warned him not to break the rules of the Land of Bone Tribulation. They had entered the land in this way before. As per the advice he was given, Luo Zheng just watched on as the bone slaves paddled the boat forward slowly.</p>

  <p>Their intelligence was at the most basic level, and although they were able to communicate smoothly with Luo Zheng, they seemed to know very little. When he asked of theirs and the Land of Bone Tribulation's origin, all they offered was dull, stiff answers.</p>

  <p>After asking a few more questions, Luo Zheng gave up this pursuit with them.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash...</p>

  <p>The boat continued on slowly, bypassing bones jutting out of the sea one by one, before Luo Zheng finally caught sight of a white island.</p>

  <p>The island was made of thick bones piling up together and in the center was a huge skull, but Luo Zheng didn't know what creature it belonged to.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Land of Bone Tribulation?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," a bone slave nodded.</p>

  <p>As the boat slowly approached the shore, Luo Zheng leaped casually into the air and landed on the island.</p>

  <p>He stood firm when suddenly, a handful of sea water splashed at his head!</p>

  <p>Being on the Other Shore for so long, Luo Zheng was very alert to Soul Interdicting Water and the like. The thunder wings on his back exploded violently as his body turned away, barely avoiding the Soul Interdicting Water!</p>

  <p>He stabilized in midair and now saw clearly that there were more than a dozen creatures on both sides of the island!</p>

  <p>They were of many different shapes and sizes; some were tiny, some were as big and burly as giants. But it was obvious they were Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't it been a long time since anyone entered the Land of Bone Tribulation?" Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>He thought he was the only one here. Seeing so many Other Shore creatures appear all of a sudden was certainly unexpected.</p>

  <p>"Creatures in the chaos can't enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, but the Other Shore creatures can," the Primeval Lord of Heaven revealed to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As long as they were not stage rulers who were bound to a certain stage, the creatures of the Other Shore were also capable of becoming stronger, gaining the Holy Soul, receiving the training in the Land of Bone Tribulation and entering the Eternal Scroll Painting to get to Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>"It's that human brat!"</p>

  <p>"Human, don't you know the rules? Those from outside the Other Shore must be tainted with the Soul Interdicting Water before they can land!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a rule. We'll let you down after you bath in the Soul Interdicting Water!"</p>

  <p>The Land of Bone Tribulation was more difficult to pass through and would take more time than the Soul City.</p>

  <p>These Other Shore creatures had been here a long time and had become familiar with each other. Ganging up against outsiders was easy for them.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng was quite clearly an outsider.</p>

  <p>"Rules? Who made these rules?" Luo Zheng asked narrowing his eyes slightly.</p>

  <p>"No one made them, this has always been the way in the Land of Bone Tribulation," explained an Other Shore creature.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha," Luo Zheng laughed coldly. "No one in the chaos has been able to enter here after ancient times, and still, after so long, this rule has not been abolished? Or is it that you made it up just now?"</p>

  <p>The Soul Interdicting Water only had an effect on the creatures outside the Other Shore. This rule was clearly intended for the creatures in chaos. But it had been quite a long time since any of them stepped into this land.</p>

  <p>Why did the rule come back just as Luo Zheng had appeared? This must be the doing of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's question left the Other Shore creatures speechless.</p>

  <p>"The only reason why you sprayed the Soul Interdicting Water on me is to prevent me from escaping, am I right?" he asked, slowly descending as the Other Shore Power within the Civilization Artifact surged crazily in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power erupted and sent his body smashing down towards the island like a meteorite falling from the sky.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures had intended to surround Luo Zheng, but when they felt the speed at which he had fallen, they all wore stunned expressions and rushed backwards.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slammed into the island.</p>

  <p>Under the immense power, the entire island began shaking violently and spreading mini tsunamis out over the surrounding sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the ground in surprise. It too was made of bones, but they were tough far beyond his expectations. There wasn't even a hint of damage to them from his impact!</p>

  <p>He might not have shattered the bones, but instead shattered the confidence of the Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>It seemed it was as Luo Zheng had guessed; they had indeed received news that a creature from the chaos was on his way and if they captured him, their races would be rewarded handsomely.</p>

  <p>They had expected the creature from the chaos would be weak and an easy capture if they took advantage of the Soul Interdicting Water, as long as he was off guard. They certainly had not expected him to possess such incredible strength.</p>

  <p>They were stunned silent and lowered their heads like children being reprimanded by their parents.</p>

  <p>After all, they were not creatures from the chaos and could not leave the Other Shore. Surrendering was their best option when faced with a far stronger warrior.</p>

  <p>"Does anyone else want to sprinkle the Soul Interdicting Water on me?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked menacingly as he scanned the creatures around.</p>

  <p>No one answered. They just looked at Luo Zheng with reverence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked towards a burly creature. He had the head of a bull and a pair of sharp horns. He was from the Sturdy Bull race residing in Stage Twenty-seven. Seeing Luo Zheng heading straight for him, the Sturdy Bull quickly explained in a panic, "He told us the news. He came here and told us that if we attacked you, the Element Spirit race would reward us, which would benefit our race!"</p>

  <p>The Sturdy Bull pointed at a cat-like creature not far off.</p>

  <p>The cat-like creature took two steps back when he was pointed out. His eyes narrowed and gazed dangerously, ready to deal with Luo Zheng's attack at any moment.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng just glanced at him indifferently and said, "I came here to pass the Land of Bone Tribulation. As for the grudge between me and the Element Spirit race, you'd better stay out of it!"</p>

  <p>These Other Shore creatures were also outstanding warriors of their different races. They had thought Luo Zheng was a weak lamb they could bully, and naturally they wanted to rush forward to capture him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng displayed such great power that they decided it was better to not risk their lives!</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. I'm not a member of the Element Spirit race," the Sturdy Bull nodded.</p>

  <p>They immediately let out a sigh of relief and all the tension in the atmosphere relaxed when Luo Zheng showed restrained hostility.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked into the depths of the island and asked, "Has the Land of Bone Tribulation opened yet?"</p>

  <p>On the bone boat, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had told him the basics rules of the Land of Bone Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Like the Soul City, the Land of Bone Tribulation also opened for a period of time and then closed for another period of time. But the periods were much longer than that of the Soul City.</p>
