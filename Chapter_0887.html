</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze had been fixed on Maurice from start to finish. On the other hand, Maurice's gaze hadn't shifted away from Luo Luo Zheng either.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin absorbed the brown-colored blood quickly until it left no trace at all.</p>

  <p>If no one moved Bradley's body, then it would also be absorbed by the Tower of Sin within a day.</p>

  <p>It was this character of the Tower of Sin that enabled it to continuously operate. It never stopped absorbing external things to replenish its energy.</p>

  <p>This ability of the tower was very advantageous to the ogres before. They killed their opponents in the arena and absorbed their opponents' Lucky Light. Then their opponents' blood and bodies were absorbed by the Tower of Sin, therefore, refilling its energy. Moreover, the ogres were also using the Tower of Sin as a place to cultivate and improve themselves. That situation created the perfect co-existence between the two. It was perfect.</p>

  <p>It was in this same tower that the ogres had risen.</p>

  <p>However, things had changed dramatically. The power in the tower was now controlled by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Maurice understood how Luo Luo Zheng had the right to determine everyone's life and death inside that tower.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he also realized that they, the ogres, simply didn't have the qualifications to negotiate.</p>

  <p>"Do you accept my conditions now?" It was Luo Luo Zheng who broke the long silence.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Maurice's face. He had always thought that he was the master of the Tower of Sin. Even if Esther defeated him, he was the leader of the top ten top-level war lords of the ogres and was not afraid of the Demon Night at all.</p>

  <p>He felt that he managed his business in the Tower of Sin very well. Every time he returned to the two sacred places of the ogres, he would be rewarded with many things by the ogre warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>But then, facing Luo Luo Zheng suddenly made him feel powerless. It was as if all the strength in his body had been sucked out as he stood before the young level one war general.</p>

  <p>This was indeed too unreasonable. Luo Luo Zheng had only been in the Tower of Sin for a few months. More so, he had only climbed onto the tenth floor. Just what basis did he have?</p>

  <p>However, the young lad had the power of the Tower of Sin and it was that same power that wasn't allowing him to resist.</p>

  <p>Maurice knew the consequences that he would face if the ogres were to be expelled from the Tower of Sin. Regardless of how much the powerful warriors at Soul Sea Realm valued him, he would encounter the wrath of all the ogres once they were pushed out of the tower.</p>

  <p>It was very likely for him to become the sinner of the ages and be despised by the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>But what could he do? How could he resist?</p>

  <p>Maurice's strength might be slightly stronger than Bradley's, but the two of them were both top-level war lords. Maurice was number two while Bradley was number four among the 128 seat owners. The difference in their strength wasn't that great.</p>

  <p>They couldn't hold a candle to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Maurice could almost see himself being torn to pieces just like Bradley.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but I can't accept your conditions," Maurice, who had been silent for a while, finally said.</p>

  <p>"Then I will kill all of the ogres," Luo Luo Zheng calmly replied. His eyes might be as calm as still water and yet the devil inside him could be seen. Although his tone was flat, the killing intent that reflected in his eyes was terrifying.</p>

  <p>There was no question that the man would kill them all if they wouldn't listen.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was so arrogant!</p>

  <p>All the top-level war lords of the ogres might have different thoughts by that time. However, they were all certain of their deep fear of Luo Luo Zheng. They believed that Luo Luo Zheng could do what he said.</p>

  <p>Even the top-level war lords of the Demon Night sighed silently.</p>

  <p>They were disdainful of the human race too when Luo Luo Zheng was surrounded by numerous top-level war lords of the ogres on the tenth floor back then. The Demon Night would never have intervened in the matter if their queen hadn't appeared.</p>

  <p>This was because offending the ogres for the sake of the human race was something only fools would do.</p>

  <p>Now that they thought about it, they felt extremely fortunate. In other words, their queen had brought good luck to the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was never against the Demon Night after all.</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night would also feel threatened by Luo Luo Zheng if their queen didn't appear. The consequences would have been unimaginable if they had provoked Luo Luo Zheng. The Demon Night's fate wouldn't have been good either.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the four human seat owners were still in a daze.</p>

  <p>The humans in the Tower of Sin had endured for hundreds and thousands of years. Who would have thought that Luo Zheng's appearance would completely change the situation?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, a mere human like them, now had the power to determine the life and death of all creatures in the Tower of Sin. The human race should be proud!</p>

  <p>However, they didn't have any clue on how to lift their pride and their heads just yet. They were just too glad that Luo Luo Zheng was of the same race as they were, humans.</p>

  <p>"I would like you to understand that I am not just threatening you," said Luo Luo Zheng calmly. "I will kill all of you if you don't accept my conditions."</p>

  <p>Maurice laughed bitterly. "I know, but the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place still have enough power. If you drive us out of the tower, I think that the Purple Heart Sacred Place will be trampled to the ground by our sacred places. Either of our two sacred places can trample the Purple Heart Sacred Place to the ground effortlessly. Are you sure you still want to do that?"</p>

  <p>Those words from Maurice immediately made the four top-level war lords of the human race tensed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not originate from the sacred place and they had already concluded that he had never stepped into the sacred place before. Luo Luo Zheng would not have any sense of belonging to the sacred place. Even if the sacred place was trampled over by the ogres, he would not have any feelings for it.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng didn't care about the Purple Heart Sacred Place, Fabian, Jarrod, and the other humans did. This was the only inheritance for the human race on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Maurice said this with bitterness and Luo Luo Zheng knew he was threatening him with the destiny of the Purple Heart Sacred Place. If he drove all of the ogres out of the Tower of Sin, the ogres would trample the Purple Heart Sacred Place to the ground. Maurice didn't think Luo Luo Zheng was indifferent with that.</p>

  <p>Fabian wanted to dissuade Luo Luo Zheng, but the words were stuck in his throat.</p>

  <p>But neither he nor the other humans had the right to change Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Luo Zheng was human. The question was, was there any other relationship between Luo Luo Zheng and them other than belonging to the same race?</p>

  <p>What advantage had Luo Luo Zheng ever gotten from the Purple Heart Sacred Place?</p>

  <p>Nothing! On the contrary, it was Luo Luo Zheng who had shown grace to the human race.</p>

  <p>"No more nonsense!" Luo Luo Zheng curled his lips and raised a finger. "There's no need to think about it. I will give you a month's time. One month from now, if I find any ogre in the tower, I will kill him mercilessly."</p>

  <p>The expressions on Fabian's, Jarod's, and the other two seat owners' faces changed drastically.</p>

  <p>'The Purple Heart Sacred Place will be in danger, ' they thought in unison.</p>

  <p>The few human warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were not a match for the ogres. Either of the Dread Ogre Sacred Place and the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place would be more than enough to flatten the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>Fabian couldn't help but speak with a hint of pleading in his voice.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't even look at this top-level war lord. His gaze was cold as if he didn't care about the Purple Heart Sacred Place at all.</p>

  <p>"Don't you care about the existence of the Purple Heart Sacred Place?"</p>

  <p>Maurice's face completely darkened. He then added, "Do you even care about the life and death of humans like you?" This was the last card Maurice had in his hand. He didn't have anything else to threaten Luo Luo Zheng with.</p>

  <p>A faint smile cracked Luo Zheng's lips. "I believe you've already investigated me.</p>

  <p>Since I'm not from the Sea God Continent, what does the existence of the Purple Heart Sacred Place have to do with me? Besides..."</p>

  <p>"Besides what?" Maurice asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Flaming Ogre Sacred Place can make a move against the Purple Heart Sacred Place?" Luo Luo Zheng continued to ask with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Maurice's eyes flashed. He suddenly realized that he seemed to have forgotten something.</p>

  <p>That was when a red light flickered as Xun's figure appeared once again next to Luo Luo Zheng. The top-level war lords of the Demon Night immediately knelt on the ground upon seeing her.</p>

  <p>Even Esther knelt before Xun and said, "Greetings, my queen!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled at Xun and then told Maurice, "You've forgotten about the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent had fourteen great races. These races all had their sacred places.</p>

  <p>However, not all those sacred places were strong. For example, the humans' Purple Heart Sacred Place was considered a sixth-grade sacred place because of the existence of several warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. Two thousand years ago, the human race didn't even have their sacred place.</p>

  <p>There was only Purple Heart Sect.</p>

  <p>The humans' sacred place was considered the weakest among all the sacred places.</p>

  <p>However, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place were considered the peak of the sixth grade sacred places. Combining the two sacred places would enable the ogres to have a seventh grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, there was only one seventh grade sacred place on the Sea God Continent, which was the Heavenly Father Sacred Place. And the reason why the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place could be promoted to the seventh grade was because of Amber's existence.</p>

  <p>Amber had also promised that she would give her all to help Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
