<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The arrow landed in front of Zheng, not because the archer missed his target but because it was undoubtedly a warning.</p>

  <p>If Zheng and his people continued marching ahead, the next arrow would not be aimed at the ground but at him.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated, considering his options when a large black tree not far away flashed a green light. Then it rumbled, shook vigorously and pulled out its thick roots from the ground, starting trudging towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the others saw this freakish sight, they all panicked and hid behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, was pretty calm. It was not the first time that he had seen a walking tree. He had seen one on the Cloud Road before, though it wasn't this big.</p>

  <p>The big tree came lumbering towards Zheng, waved its thick branches, and said in a deep voice, "Human, leave this place. You cannot pass."</p>

  <p>It was a warning. Zheng would have to change his plans and his route.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered. If it were just him, he would have gone anywhere he wanted. But he was now leading hundreds of people, so he couldn't take a risk.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a muffled voice came from behind Zheng, "Kid, I think you'd better stay."</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around and saw hundreds of ogres standing before him.</p>

  <p>Most of these ogres had the strength similar to that of the ogre governor, but two ogres in particular were stronger. The one who had just spoken was one of them.</p>

  <p>Zheng regarded the two ogres, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Why do you want us to stay?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Either you stay here or you die," the ogre said in an arrogant voice. "You are just a level seven war fighter. You simply don't have the ability to fight!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was also very curious about the cultivation hierarchy of this continent, so he asked, "If I'm a level seven war fighter, what are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am not a war fighter. I am a level five war general," the ogre replied proudly.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" A faint smile appeared on Zheng's face. The forceful energy within his body suddenly erupted, and he sped off in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>This was the benefit of refining his body— being able to power up in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>He covered the distance of several hundred feet in a flash and arrived in front of the ogre, ready to crash into him.</p>

  <p>The ogre was a level five war general. He wasn't slow but the problem was that ogres had always relied on their brute forces. No human dared to go head to head with the ogres, because it would be like smashing an egg against a rock. In the ogre's eyes, Zheng was courting death.</p>

  <p>The ogre smiled wickedly when he saw the human charging towards him all alone. He loved to show off his strength, but no human had ever dared to compete with him so this amused him.</p>

  <p>"Since you want to die, I'll grant you your wish, ha-ha!" The ogre laughed.</p>

  <p>He didn't dodge. Instead, he dashed towards Zheng too.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as he neared the ogre, and the force of five hundred dragon scales suddenly erupted inside him. The forceful energy within his body was stimulated once again as the power in his entire body reached a terrifyingly high level.</p>

  <p>Adult ogres were usually ten feet tall; much taller than humans. Whether it was the body or the bones, they were all much stronger than humans.</p>

  <p>Therefore, most ogres focused on body refinement. Their bodies were their weapons.</p>

  <p>But this ogre didn't realize that Zheng's body wasn't weak at all.</p>

  <p>Instead it was a top-grade fairy weapon, which simply couldn't be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Zheng used all his strength when he collided with the ogre. The others were flabbergasted!</p>

  <p>There was a loud boom and the ogre turned into a bloody mist. His brown-colored blood exploded like fireworks. The armor, the ornaments and his sleeves were shattered, and the debris scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was now floating in the air, had a faint layer of purplish-black protective life vitality around his body. This layer of life vitality was actually being used to block the sputtering blood.</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable. An ogre war general was smashed into pieces by Zheng just like that.</p>

  <p>The other ogres stared blankly at Zheng. One of their leaders, a level five war general, had been blown to smithereens by this human.</p>

  <p>Why was that?</p>

  <p>Ogres were slow and stupid. They weren't known for their intellectual prowess and couldn't react in time.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood in the air, proudly looking down at the ogres. He asked coldly,</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? Do you still want me to stay?"</p>

  <p>The ogres were the only ones that were shocked by Zheng's powers. His group of people were pretty calm. These humans were not warriors, so they didn't have any concept of the various levels of cultivation. Whether Zheng killed an ordinary ogre, an ogre governor, or a level five ogre war general, it would have the same effect on these people.</p>

  <p>Zheng had become a God in their minds, and God was omnipotent.</p>

  <p>Twenty miles away, more than twenty humans were hiding in a dense forest. A bearded middle-aged man took a deep breath and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This kid... Are you sure he's human?" he asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Of course he's human. Are you blind?" another person said impatiently.</p>

  <p>Beside them, a silver-haired young man said, "He's indeed human, but his cultivation method is very different from ours. A level seven war fighter easily defeated a level five war general. What's more, his opponent was an ogre. Is he from the Purple Heart Sacred Place?"</p>

  <p>"No way! If the Purple Heart Sacred Place sent someone over, it would be impossible that we wouldn't know about it. This guy is so powerful. Would the Purple Heart Sacred Place let him wander around alone? Who would be responsible if he were to get killed? If we throw this man into the Tower of Sin, it will bring us unlimited benefits. He cannot die!" Someone else quickly analyzed the situation.</p>

  <p>"That's right. We must save him at all costs!" Azure light suddenly shone in the silver-haired man's eyes.</p>

  <p>The bearded middle-aged man laughed as he took out his scimitar and gently rubbed it on a tree beside him. "Now, let's look at the situation. I'm afraid that this group of ogres can't do anything! If he can get rid of these ogres and then turn around to come to us, this matter will be resolved."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there were three creatures leaning on the huge tree trunk about ten miles away from the moving ancient tree.</p>

  <p>If Zheng saw them, he would quickly realize that their characteristics were almost exactly the same as the sword spirit Lily's.</p>

  <p>Sharp ears, an almost perfect figure, long and slender legs— they were exactly like the members of the Demon Night, a race the God had painstakingly created.</p>

  <p>One of them was a female who was carrying a huge bow made of bone. She was nearly eight feet tall, but her bow was even longer than her. On her back was a huge quiver containing five arrows also made of bones.</p>

  <p>"That human is very unique," she said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"This entire situation has nothing to do with us. As long as he doesn't step into our territory, it'll be fine," replied another male member of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," the woman replied nodding her head. Then she turned and, with the grace of a leopard, jumped up on the tree. Her tall and light body allowed her to effortlessly climb up onto the treetops.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before the ogres came back to their senses and the gravity of the situation sank in.</p>

  <p>Their dazed expressions began to change and realization slowly struck them. Their faces were a mix of anger, sadness and shock, and, finally, utter humiliation. Yes, deep humiliation.</p>

  <p>The ogres were fierce and aggressive, and unafraid in the face of death.</p>

  <p>Dying on the battlefield was a great honor for them, but to be struck to death by a mere human? This was a disgrace! This was a huge embarrassment!</p>

  <p>How had Zheng managed to do it? They didn't waste time trying to figure it out because, at this moment, all they wanted to do was rip him to shreds!</p>

  <p>The remaining ogre war general and many ogre war fighters roared angrily and thundered towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Rip that human to pieces!"</p>

  <p>"I will skin him with a knife and eat his flesh!"</p>

  <p>"Pound him! Kill him! Twist his body into a pretzel! Bury him in the ground!"</p>

  <p>They roared and dashed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was calm. Killing humans might have some psychological effect on him, but killing these ogres? Not at all! Even though they possessed intelligence, killing them was no different than slaughtering chickens to him.</p>

  <p>"Let me carve the path to your death," said Zheng ruthlessly. After he had experienced many hardships, his heart had become cold and hard like a stone.</p>
