<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was unavoidable that Fabian and the others felt envious of Xun when Esther gave the Black Nether Beads to her. However, since Xun was the queen of Demon Night, their jealousy was pretty much displaced.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng put away the two Black Nether Beads in his space ring, Esther knelt down in front of Xun. "My queen, the Tide of Chaos in the Dark Nether Cave will make this place extremely dangerous. Please return to the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Esther had originally wanted to tell her queen that everything they would obtain in the Dark Nether Cave would be offered to her. But now, she restrained herself from doing so. Fabian would've no doubt already warned Luo Zheng about the Tide of Chaos and must've also tried to persuade him to return. The fact that Luo Zheng was still here made it obvious that both he and Xun insisted to stay.</p>

  <p>It was the second time someone had tried to persuade Xun to return to the Tower of Sin. Though it was for her own good, as well as for Zheng's good, Xun's face still darkened in displeasure from Esther's words.</p>

  <p>Xun knew that Luo Zheng was definitely not going to give up such a good chance to explore the Dark Nether Cave. Since he was the one who had made it possible for her to regain her throne, she felt immensely displeased upon hearing Esther's words that could effectively dampen the young man's enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I won't go back," Xun stated coldly.</p>

  <p>The queen's coldness made Esther's heart tremble. Knowing that her advice had been deemed useless, she immediately stood up. "Since that is the case, I humbly beg you to allow us to stay and explore the Dark Nether Cave with you."</p>

  <p>"That is a good suggestion!" Fabian exclaimed with great joy. Esther, after all, was the most powerful top-level war lord in the Tower of Sin. Back on the tenth floor, Esther's name had managed to climb all the way up to the fourth row on the Talent Tablet. Now, with the strength of a top-level war lord, she was probably not much weaker than any common war sage.</p>

  <p>Fabian would feel more assured if she joined their party.</p>

  <p>Several days ago, Zheng's decision to follow the human war lords into the Dark Nether Cave had worried Esther greatly. She had even gone as far as to invite Luo Zheng to follow the Demon Night instead. Xun was still a sword spirit who relied on Zheng's body to exist. If Luo Zheng died, so would Xun. In the end, everything was all for the Demon Night Queen.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, her offer was immediately turned down by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, with the threat of great danger looming overhead, Esther had chosen to stay by Xun's side to protect her.</p>

  <p>Both Esther and Fabian hurriedly took out their maps with the intent of choosing a relatively easy route to explore.</p>

  <p>Yolande stood idle on the side while the two put their heads together to strategize. Suddenly though, her relaxed pose stiffened as she quickly turned around and pointed her slender finger into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>Four people walked out from the forest and the one leading them wore an embarrassed smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Esther's expression turned cold. "Night Group?</p>

  <p>"Esther!" one of them greeted sheepishly. "How have you been?"</p>

  <p>The Night Group was a powerful group. Their Eternal Night Sacred Place ranked fifth in the entire Sea God Continent and was considered a backbone of the sixth-grade sacred places. However, they had always been a vassal force of the ogre group and did not really have a say in major decisions in the tower.</p>

  <p>While they were deemed a quiet and under-the-radar group, the removal of the ogres from the Tower of Sin greatly changed their dynamic. The race that they had always been attached to was suddenly driven out of the Tower of Sin which meant the safety net they had all thought would protect them was immediately removed. The result was a disastrous decline of their status in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The members of the Night Group were all born assassins. All of them were incredibly skilled in the art of deceit, concealment, and striking their opponents when they least expected it.</p>

  <p>The four top-level war lords of the Night Group were living testaments of their strength. They had all hidden themselves so well, and even Esther failed to notice them.</p>

  <p>Esther casually glanced at Yolande. The girl's sense of perception could be higher than Esther's yet she was only a tenth-level war general. She really was a mystery.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how good they were at hiding themselves, the Night Group was terrible when it came to face-to-face combat. "Shane Xue,"</p>

  <p>Esther glared as her body began to emit a colorful, mysterious ethereal light. "Are you here to try to kill Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Her stance told them she was ready to attack, and rightly so. The Night Group had always been the ogre race's ally and had been intentionally trained to assassinate those that caused trouble for the ogres in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Shane Xue was a seat owner and one of the strongest among the Night Group. Esther's intimidating pose had him hurriedly waving his hand in front of her, "No! No! You have mistaken me! It's actually the opposite," he quickly clarified. "The tide of chaos is ravaging the Dark Nether Cave. We actually wanted to join you."</p>

  <p>Esther sneered, "Do you even think you're qualified to go with us?"</p>

  <p>Her remark caused Shane Xue and his companions to go red in the face.</p>

  <p>The four of them were also top-level war lords, the same as Esther, so why would they be unqualified?</p>

  <p>However, Esther's reputation made them keep their mouths shut. Their strength lay in the shadows and not in direct confrontation.</p>

  <p>Fabian suddenly butted in, "I want to say something!" he said, raising his hand. "With the situation we're all currently in, I don't think it's a bad choice to cooperate."</p>

  <p>Fabian saw the advantage of allying with the Night Group. A race dedicated to honing themselves as assassins were no doubt good at hiding themselves from the many dangers that abounded in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>He didn't like them one bit, but there was no need to make things difficult for themselves. Besides, they currently had the upper hand and even if the Night Group tried anything against Luo Zheng, they would have Esther to deal with them. Fabian also had no doubt that Luo Zheng was more than capable of taking care of himself and could actually be on par with his own strength.</p>

  <p>There were only four top-level war lords in the Night Group and they were not much of a threat should they decide to betray them halfway.</p>

  <p>Shane Xue laughed, "Fabian is right! Although our Night Group isn't strong, we have our talents that could benefit you!'</p>

  <p>Esther visibly hesitated. She immediately weighed the pros and cons before coming up with a decision. In the end, Esther figured that she had absolute confidence in her own strength and keeping a few Night Group members as back-up wasn't too bad. She agreed to Fabian's proposal with a nod.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, a temporary team was formed. They all got together to discuss their next moves and were able to work out a new route. Not long after, they were able to set out to explore once again.</p>

  <p>At the same time, on the other side of the Tower of Sin, two burly figures hid in a secret passageway. Their size and build immediately identified them as the two top-level war lords of the ogre race: Malcom and Rehaan.</p>

  <p>Before the ogres withdrew from the Tower of Sin, Boyd and Rehaan had been ordered to lurk inside the secret passageway. However, due to Malcom's request, they replaced Boyd and let him take his place.</p>

  <p>The failure of killing Luo Zheng weighed heavily on Malcom's shoulders and made him feel extremely depressed. His troubles were so great that the frustration alone was enough to make his warrior spirit waver.</p>

  <p>However, the negative emotions actually worked to his advantage. His frustrations effectively increased his motivation and he had managed a breakthrough in such a short period of time!</p>

  <p>Malcom was now a first level war sage!</p>

  <p>Rehaan, on the other hand, was still a top-level war lord.</p>

  <p>Although most of the seat owners of the Tower of Sin suppressed their cultivation level, in truth, it wasn't easy for them to break through and become a war sage. Moreover, Malcolm had experienced a life and death crisis on his ascension!</p>

  <p>The secret passageway was large enough to fit a couple of humans or Demon Night members but it was too small for the ogres. Dealing with a life and death crisis in such a narrow space was extremely agonizing and Malcom almost didn't make it!</p>

  <p>However, in the end, he managed to push through! Rehaan hadn't broken through yet but Malcom's current strength would be enough for them to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Shane has sent news," Rehaan reported. "They've found Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Malcom nodded at this new information and said, "Okay." Previously, Malcom had ranked lower than Rehaan but his recent breakthrough had switched their positions.</p>

  <p>"I've been stuck in this place for months. Now, I can finally leave," Malcom said as he came out of the other side and went into the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Rehaan followed closely behind him. "I really wonder how Colin and Neil got through this," he said as he stretched out his body. "That place is suffocating!"</p>

  <p>Malcom grunted, "Let's go. The humans are able to play in the tower for a few months but it's time for us ogres to take everything back," he said, cracking his knuckles. "It's time to eliminate Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>As the controller of the Tower of Sin, Luo Zheng had no doubt become a star. The ogres couldn't really directly confront him. However, they couldn't just sit idly by. They had a plan.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng ventured outside the confines of the tower and into the Dark Nether Cave, they would now be able to stand a chance against him.</p>

  <p>Malcom's recent breakthrough was also a plus. So long as they killed Luo Zheng, the ogres would be able to return and take back their glory.</p>

  <p>When that happened, all the seats that were taken from them by the humans and the Demon Night shall be returned rightfully to them.</p>

  <p>No matter what, none of the other races could cultivate a war sage in the Tower of Sin, but the ogres could!</p>
