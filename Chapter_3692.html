<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soon after, Mahoney arrived above the Vast Sea Province and released a Minimum Space from her space ring.</p>

  <p>The Minimum Space was almost weightless and so small that to the eye and touch it was almost nothing. If an ordinary person were to touch it, it would pass straight through their bodies.</p>

  <p>Because of this, it was only through her space theurgies that Mahoney could move these Minimum Spaces.</p>

  <p>After she released one, it floated slowly in the air.</p>

  <p>With a gentle breeze, the Minimum Space, which was a million times smaller than dust, spiraled in the air and floated downwards.</p>

  <p>The sun shone in the Vast Sea Province, so it was definitely not as dark as the abyss.</p>

  <p>With the sunlight beaming, even if the Minimum Space emitted light, it was nowhere near as dazzling as the star and would be a little more inconspicuous.</p>

  <p>It continued floating down gently before making its way down to an island below.</p>

  <p>The Vast Sea Province was almost completely covered in water, with only a few large islands present on the surface.</p>

  <p>On the island below, there lived a small race called the Fox Fish race. Their race's power was ranked high in the Vast Sea Province. But even if they were ranked in the top ten in the Vast Sea Province, it was still a very small and insignificant race when compared to the super powers in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Any master from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race would be capable of destroying such a puny race.</p>

  <p>However, as the Vast Sea Province was relatively remote, and there was no unique production, it had always been peaceful.</p>

  <p>Except for the two great races fighting underwater from time to time, peace was maintained. Such a harmonious state was rarely seen in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Look over there. What's that?" a member of the Fox Fish race said as he had noticed the dot of light falling from the sky.</p>

  <p>Many of the Fox Fish race then looked up curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is there a star falling?"</p>

  <p>"It's daytime..."</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look!"</p>

  <p>They had no idea of the impending doom and still chased after the dot of light.</p>

  <p>One of them was faster than the rest.</p>

  <p>He had reached the consummation of True God Realm. He constantly flashed his figure and got below the light first.</p>

  <p>"What a small dot of light! But it's so bright that it can be seen dozens of miles away. What sort of treasure is this?" he exclaimed, reaching out to touch the light still gliding down.</p>

  <p>The moment he came into contact with this Minimum Space, it penetrated right through his hand and fell to the ground, going further down deep into the earth below his feet.</p>

  <p>"What the..."</p>

  <p>He was a little confused. Was that light actually real?</p>

  <p>Naturally, there was no way for him to understand how small the Minimum Space was. Compared with the Minimum Space, his body was like a rough sieve through which the space could just pass straight.</p>

  <p>As he pondered on the dot of light, he felt a heat rising from beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A cyan flame burst from the ground and soared into the sky.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Fox Fish race standing in the distance saw the soaring column of fire and their faces filled with horror. They all turned to run the other way, spurred on by their absolute terror.</p>

  <p>But the cyan flame was spreading too fast.</p>

  <p>Before they could turn, the cyan fire column had caught up to them, engulfing their bodies instantly.</p>

  <p>It was as Divine Farmer had said; the flame released from the Minimum Space was not very powerful and wouldn't cause any harm to the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm or warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>However, 99.9% of creatures in the Source World were unable to resist it.</p>

  <p>As the cyan flames continued to spread rapidly, the members of the Fox Fish race screamed, roared, and cried with despair as most of them were burnt to ashes in seconds.</p>

  <p>Everything, including the trees and buildings, was set on fire...</p>

  <p>The Fox Fish at the consummation of True God Realm laid an enchanted barrier against the flames rising from below, but it could only hold off the fire for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>He swiftly switched to trying to use the Grand Teleportation to avoid the cyan flames.</p>

  <p>But just as he had teleported to a position he thought was safe, the flames had already spread and enveloped him once again.</p>

  <p>He used the Grand Teleportation again, but was still caught by the fast spreading cyan flames...</p>

  <p>When he finally reached the sea surface, he found that the cyan flames seemed to have covered the entire Vast Sea Province!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>He leaped into the sea.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the sea water began to boil.</p>

  <p>But compared to the burning of the flames, he considered the water 'cool'.</p>

  <p>At the very least, he could endure the heat of the boiling much easier.</p>

  <p>He soon found, however, that even the bottom of the sea was not safe...</p>

  <p>The cyan flames had spread to fill the entire Vast Sea Province. Even the sea water began steaming intensely under the frenzied burning of the flames, and the sea level began falling at a visible rate.</p>

  <p>The large races at the bottom of the sea then fell into panic as well.</p>

  <p>They didn't know where the flames had come from, but at the rate the water steamed and evaporated, it wouldn't be long before the sea water completely disappeared, and their fate would be no different from that of the creatures on the island.</p>

  <p>What unfolded before their eyes was completely beyond their knowledge and expectations.</p>

  <p>They couldn't understand why someone would kill the others and destroy everything for no reason.</p>

  <p>As the flames continued to roll in the air, all the sea water in the Vast Sea Province was totally evaporated.</p>

  <p>Floating high above in midair, Mahoney looked down indifferently.</p>

  <p>Once the sea water had evaporated, the boundless salt was released. The salt and the black charcoal mixed together, forming an endless black salt land...</p>

  <p>Puff...</p>

  <p>The flames in the Minimum Space finally burnt out.</p>

  <p>The flaming Vast Sea Province finally regained some semblance of coolness.</p>

  <p>Only a minute number of creatures survived. Some of them were powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm who had special Other Shore Tokens, and two were powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, sitting at the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, these two supreme elders had been the strongest warriors of two races in the Vast Sea Province. They had fought for a resource for tens of thousands of years, and the two of them had always been at the forefront of the battle.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected that they could lose everything they possessed so quickly. The sea water had been evaporated and their clansmen burnt to a crisp. They were left with nothing.</p>

  <p>The two of them looked at each other speechlessly, with awe, horror and hopelessness in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Even though they were powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, they could do nothing about that fire except protect themselves.</p>

  <p>Tens of billions of creatures died in fear and anger right in front of them, as they watched.</p>

  <p>Negative emotions could be infectious.</p>

  <p>One person's negative emotions could be passed to a group, and that group could do the same to the world.</p>

  <p>The negative emotions of tens of billions of creatures were like an invisible hammer that slammed down and began to shake the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Even Mahoney seemed to be affected by it. She took a deep breath before darting off towards the province next to the Vast Sea Province.</p>
