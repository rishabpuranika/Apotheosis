<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected Luo Zheng to demonstrate such extraordinary strength during the test!</p>

  <p>Although the phantom warriors at the pinnacle of the nature level in the magic array only had the basic strength of this level and were not as powerful as the real ones, Mu Ning could only deal with 2 or 3 simultaneously. During the test, she remained undefeated. However, she could not kill them. But Luo Zheng performed better than her. Not only did he resist the opponents, but he also found opportunities to fight back!</p>

  <p>A red dot on the magic array plate disappeared in a few moments.</p>

  <p>Every red dot on the magic array plate represented a phantom warrior who had reached the peak of the nature level. The disappearance of one red dot meant that Luo Zheng had managed to kill that phantom.</p>

  <p>"He can fight back despite being attacked by ten men at the highest grade of the nature level. How does he manage to do that?" Mu Ning and the other masters were wondering whether Luo Zheng had managed to elude his enemies by running away with some kind of rare body movement and footwork.</p>

  <p>But the warriors being killed in the magic array indicated that Luo Zheng was not running away. On the contrary, he was fighting back.</p>

  <p>There was a huge gap between the inner and outer disciples at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>The outer disciples were reserved talents for the inner disciples, and only the ones that qualified could become inner disciples. Even at Drizzle Peak, which ranked last among the 33 Peaks at Cloud Sect, there was an inner disciple who had reached the pinnacle of the nature level.</p>

  <p>While in the peaks ranking at the forefront, such as the Skytop Peak, some inner disciples had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's performance proved that he was a top elite even though he was an outer disciple of Cloud Sect!</p>

  <p>An hour later, people outside the magic array noticed that the white fog had begun to disperse. Finally, they could see Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's over at last. He is a genius!"</p>

  <p>"I want to know how many points he got."</p>

  <p>Many outer disciples had been waiting for nearly two hours to see how many points Luo Zheng earned in the test. They hadn't thought that they would have to wait for such a long time.</p>

  <p>The master checked the magic array plate and shouted, "Luo Zheng Luo, 55, 000 points!"</p>

  <p>"Ooh ..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the score, the disciples erupted with excitement. Several heated discussions began.</p>

  <p>It was a staggering figure.</p>

  <p>Wurth's and Nory's eyes were wide with excitement. As Zheng's friends, they knew that he was strong. But neither of them had fought with Luo Zheng, and so they could not provide specific numbers to quantify his strength.</p>

  <p>But the score helped settle the matter.</p>

  <p>55, 000 points!</p>

  <p>The number was twenty times more than Wurth's.</p>

  <p>"Does this mean that Luo Zheng can beat twenty men of my strength simultaneously?" Wurth smiled and said.</p>

  <p>Nory laughed and answered, "Twenty men? Is that all? I'm sure he can handle more. Haha!"</p>

  <p>Obviously, a man's strength couldn't be measured by a specific number.</p>

  <p>Wurth couldn't win against Luo Zheng with his strength. If he decided to challenge Luo Zheng with support from others, he would need an army composed of soldiers of the same strength as him. A large number of people could drain Zheng's power enough to defeat him.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's score, Ben's heart sank. A reluctant smile replaced the hope he had felt. He knew he didn't have a chance anymore.</p>

  <p>He had been overconfident before Luo Zheng finished the test. He had thought that Luo Zheng was only at the second-grade of the nature level. Ben had rationalized that no matter how strong Luo Zheng was, there was a limit. Ben had been practicing martial arts since his childhood, and he was the best in his family. With the help of the top three family clans of his county, Ben had entered Cloud Sect at a young age. Then he became the inner disciple without much effort.</p>

  <p>Up until now, he had been the pride of his family.</p>

  <p>So Ben had decided that if Zheng's score exceeded his, he would challenge Luo Zheng. Although he was not quite sure of his victory over Luo Zheng, Ben still wanted to try. He wouldn't be willing to admit defeat if he didn't try once.</p>

  <p>But when he heard the master announce that thrilling score, Ben gave up his plans.</p>

  <p>55, 000 points!</p>

  <p>Yehudi Zuo, who ranked the first among the inner disciples, had scored a little more than 40, 000 points. Yehudi had reached the peak of the nature level, while Luo Zheng was only at the second-grade of the nature level. It was shocking that Luo Zheng was stronger than Yehudi!</p>

  <p>Considering Yehudi's strength, Ben had no courage to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng seemed to be stronger than Yehudi, Ben was sure that Luo Zheng would trounce him. With that thought, Ben decided not to humiliate himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng earned 55, 000 points when he was at the second-grade of the nature level. He ranked first among the inner disciples at Drizzle Peak as soon as he became an inner disciple.</p>

  <p>The news spread through Drizzle Peak like wildfire!</p>

  <p>There had always been a huge gap between the inner disciples and the outer disciples. Any inner disciple could beat an outer disciple and become the top one among them.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's progress was unparalleled! In less than a year of being a disciple at Cloud Sect, Luo Zheng had become an inner disciple at Drizzle Peak with such a remarkable achievement. This was a situation that had never happened since the founding of Cloud Sect. He had set a new record.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was about to be promoted to inner disciple, he was still an outer disciple. So now, he represented the glory of the outer disciples!</p>

  <p>Once he became an inner disciple, Luo Zheng would get more pills and money, and access to a few secret cultivation places that were reserved only for inner disciples. Although these secret cultivation places were not as good as the Lake of the Magical Fish and the Seven Star Sword Light Platform, disciples would not need to spend points when using these places. This made it an excellent alternative for inner disciples who came from ordinary families. Even some disciples from noble clans would choose to practice in these secret cultivation places, because not every gentry child could get the full support of their family.</p>

  <p>The inner disciples lived on the top of Drizzle Peak, which was also the highest point of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>So, after passing the test, Luo Zheng was assigned a new house. He packed his luggage, put it into his space ring, and moved into his new accommodation.</p>

  <p>As he climbed from the hillside to the top of the peak, he met many inner disciples dressed in black robes, all of whom cast curious glances at him.</p>

  <p>In general, compared with the newcomers, the inner disciples who had entered the Inner Door earlier had strong psychological advantages. They looked down at the newcomers— like an experienced person looking at a green hand.</p>

  <p>After all, the new inner disciples couldn't match them in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, was an exception!</p>
