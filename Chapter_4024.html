<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng was caught in the palm of the black giant, he tried to break free using his long spear.</p>

  <p>However, the strength of the black giant was astonishing. No matter how hard Zheng struggled, it didn't budge even an inch. It continued gripping Zheng's body, rendering him motionless.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The red light was activated again. This time, it was going to aim at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened as he saw the red light shining upon him. It instantly drowned and engulfed him before he could even react.</p>

  <p>"No! Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! It was too late!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng, don't die!"</p>

  <p>The red light that shot out from the black giant's palm was so deadly that it could instantly turn almost everything into dust.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others saw how the red light engulfed Zheng, they were all terrified.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng could be turned into dust with its power. Moreover, with the monstrous grip of the black giant, there was no way that he escaped.</p>

  <p>Even the three Eternal Realm Hunters fell silent as they saw the scene.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that they thought so highly of Zheng. He was the only reason why they got all the way here.</p>

  <p>That was why they didn't expect that he would end up dying in this miserable way.</p>

  <p>As they realized that even Zheng could fall this way, they thought that they might also meet their end pretty soon.</p>

  <p>The leader of the black-robed men stood there in a daze. He was obviously in a state of shock, but his thick robe prevented others from clearly seeing his expression.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the black giant slowly opened its palm.</p>

  <p>There, everyone saw the silver armor, the long spear, and some black ashes mixing with them.</p>

  <p>On the other Pure Sky Platform, Gianni sneered as he saw the scene. He then tilted his hand that was stretched out slightly.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the black giant that was under Gianni's control also tilted its right hand. Then, the armor, spear, and the clump of black ashes slid down from its palm and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Campbell clenched his fist and bit his lip. He struggled so hard to complete his awakening, but now he was again on the verge of being killed without finding anything about the truth from the past.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>The black giant started walking, and its eyes were once again filled with the deadly red lights. At the same time, Gianni spoke in Sanskrit, "As I said earlier, it would have been less troublesome for you if you just killed yourself. Now, it's too late for that. Since you wait for me to act, I won't let you die so easily. Well, I can't totally eliminate you, but I can change your will. That way, the possibility of your awakening will be reduced, and you shall live in pain for eternity!"</p>

  <p>Just when the black giant walked past the armor and the spear, the pile of ashes scattered on the ground began to move slowly.</p>

  <p>The scattered ashes seemed like thousands of ants that gathered bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Then, in no time, they formed into a small pyramid, which was about ten inches high.</p>

  <p>On the surface of the pyramid, bright red blood slowly gushed out.</p>

  <p>The blood emitted a strange and powerful aura. As the aura quickly spread, everyone's attention was attracted to it.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is that?" Campbell looked at the red blood on the pyramid of ashes behind the black giant. His eyes were filled with confusion as he tried to discern what it really was.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, the Eternal Realm Hunters, and the men in black robes all stared blankly at the blood that grew out from the ashes. It was slowly taking a form of a plant's root, extending upward little by little. As it gradually formed, it almost looked like a blood coral in the sea.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?"</p>

  <p>Gianni walked forward and stopped at the edge of the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>He also started staring at the transforming blood that caught everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>Then, he immediately felt a familiar aura coming from it.</p>

  <p>'The ancestry-level bloodline?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng entered the Three Purities Stage, he got a hold of the ancestry-level bloodline. It dwelled in his body and gave him powerful, and sometimes, odd abilities.</p>

  <p>Gianni was also familiar with the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, but he didn't know what ability this was.</p>

  <p>Why was there a tremendous amount of aura from it? Gianni thought all about it and became more confused.</p>

  <p>'What is this growing blood-red coral? Don't tell me? '</p>

  <p>Before Gianni could finish his thoughts, the blood-red coral sort of sped up its transformation.</p>

  <p>It continued to grow until finally forming a human-shaped coral.</p>

  <p>As the human-shaped coral stood on top of the pyramid of ashes, it suddenly started absorbing all of the ashes beneath it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the human-shaped coral also reached out and grabbed both the silver armor and the long spear on the ground. The armor quickly clung to the surface of its body and it held the long spear in its hand.</p>

  <p>Finally, the cubic stone wrapped with cracks returned to its hand, and the Light of Annihilation began to flow in its hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the armor and spear restored their silver luster.</p>

  <p>"What is this kind of monster?" Gianni couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>"He already turned into ashes, but he could still return to his original shape?"</p>

  <p>"Is this Zheng's ability?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was in a daze as if seeing a miracle unfolding in their eyes again.</p>

  <p>During the battle at the Pear Hill, everyone clearly witnessed the prowess of Zheng's ability. He could change into almost anything and suppress even the most powerful enemies.</p>

  <p>But even so, no one expected this time that he would just rise from the ashes as if nothing happened.</p>

  <p>They knew how powerful he was, but they still couldn't figure out how his ability worked.</p>

  <p>Everyone who was witnessing Zheng's surprising ability was even more shocked.</p>

  <p>That included Campbell, who was still filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Those who had been baptized by the ancestry-level bloodline were known to be very powerful.</p>

  <p>Even being turned into ashes wouldn't kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>Gianni was gazing at the scene through the black giant for a long time now, but he still didn't understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>He didn't know that the blood that transformed into the human-shaped coral was the ancestry-level bloodline itself.</p>

  <p>He grew pissed at the thought that Zheng completely withstood his strength and power.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you have experienced in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>Honestly, with such a unique ability, you're qualified to join the Ten Directions House. Unfortunately, you were not born at the right time!"</p>

  <p>Gianni lashed out as he slapped the ground with his hand.</p>

  <p>Then, the black giant did the same and slapped the human-shaped coral on the ground.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The deadly red light burst out from the black giant's palm and enveloped the human-shaped coral.</p>

  <p>In the distance, the Snake Goddess took a deep breath and focused her eyes at the palm of the giant without blinking.</p>

  <p>Then, the red light gradually dissipated. At the same time, the human-shaped coral also disappeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>Soon after, everyone noticed that red corals were flickering on the surface of the black giant's arm. It was like they formed several meridians extending from its wrist up to its shoulder.</p>

  <p>In addition to the red corals, there were also white bolts of lightning that flashed from time to time. It turned out that these were the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the red and white lights intertwined and spread along its entire arm. In just a flash, its humongous arm collapsed.</p>

  <p>Because Gianni was directly linked with the black giant, he instantly felt the pain in his right arm with the collapse of the giant's arm. "Aaargh! What did he do?!" He let out a painful scream as his face contorted.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the red and white lights continued their assault and drilled into the body of the black giant this time. Gianni quickly held his chest as he felt like there was a piping hot iron stirring up his internal organs.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>With the power of the red and white lights, the giant's body collapsed and disappeared too.</p>

  <p>Finally, they aimed and drilled into its head.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!"</p>

  <p>Gianni clearly saw what the lights were after this time. He screamed furiously as he started feeling a sharp and piercing sensation in his skull.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Gianni, he couldn't just undo his link with the black giant.</p>

  <p>It was purposely made in complexity, so it would take time to break it.</p>

  <p>With that, he had no choice but to endure the severe pain brought by the red and white lights.</p>
