<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1469 The Power Of Incense (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>There were many people who worshiped the great Buddha and other deities in all kinds of temples around the universe. The incense just kept on burning continuously, making lazy tendrils of fragrant smoke that wafted through the air.</p>

  <p>Belief was held only in the believers' eyes. When there were hundreds and thousands, or even millions of creatures who fell to their knees and burned incense in reverence, even a Buddha made from clay would become their god. Their belief made it so, and gave power to the inanimate.</p>

  <p>This was the power of incense, and it worked wonders. In the eyes of the martial artists of the Upper World, the power of incense was just like the power of Faith Energy!</p>

  <p>A single belief might be insignificant, but with tens of millions, hundreds of millions, even hundreds of trillions of beliefs converged together, the power would become staggering. It was similar to the way in which countless streams converged into a river, and countless rivers converged into a great river, and then numerous great rivers converged into an ocean, and countless oceans would eventually flow in one direction, and become the Pool of Faith of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The cultivation of the queens of the Demon Night wasn't even the strongest in the entire universe. The three queens were only equivalent to world lords, but with the Faith Energy absorbed by the countless statues of the queens, and with the Faith Energy gathered from the millions of subjects worshiping them, they had the ability to defeat the Supreme Lords! Belief was their power, perhaps even more so than mere cultivation.</p>

  <p>As the Faith Energy continued to gather around Xun's body, her Mu Ning also became increasingly powerful, and the blood-red light in her eyes developed a staggering intensity!</p>

  <p>"Now! Break!"</p>

  <p>From the depths of the abyss, a stream of thin, blood-red light suddenly shot out from the giant sphere formed by the countless ghosts!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>Following that came the second, the third, the fourth stream of light?</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, there were countless streams of light coming out from the sphere! The abyss had become a light-show with the constant streams of blood-red light shooting off into space.</p>

  <p>Following the wails of the thousands of ghosts, an incomparably magnificent red sun appeared in the abyss. The Faith Energy swept through all of the ghosts like it was crushing dry weeds. The ghosts were soon disintegrated by the blood-red light.</p>

  <p>Moments later, the red sun dissipated, and Luo Luo Zheng began to fall again with Xun by his side.</p>

  <p>Dense Faith Energy circulated and slowly congealed on her body, forming a blood-red suit of armor. The shoulder guards of the armor were covered with spikes that stuck out all the way down to her back.</p>

  <p>The lower the part of her back that they reached, the longer these spikes were. The longest spike was at least twenty to thirty feet long! These two rows of spikes formed two enormous 'wings' that occupied almost the entire space within the abyss, with Xun in the center of them.</p>

  <p>The giant spiked wings on the back of Xun's slender body caused a dramatic visual impact. The sight of her armored suit and the vicious spikes was quite breathtaking.</p>

  <p>At this moment, she had transformed into the deity whom millions of creatures worshiped. A supremely noble Mu Ning was being emitted from her body. Just a glance at her would make anybody feel awed. Even Luo Luo Zheng, who had extremely powerful willpower, was no exception! He could not keep his eyes off her as she descended like a phoenix, wreathed in red light.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy was actually this powerful! He was apparently shocked.</p>

  <p>As he looked at Xun by his side, a strong sense of the unfamiliar arose in Luo Zheng's heart. It was as if Xun had achieved a complete transformation at this moment?</p>

  <p>The truth was that this was indeed the case. After absorbing a certain amount of Faith Energy, Xun had obtained divinity. Although there was a great difference between her and a True God, the Mu Ning she exuded was almost the same quality as that of a True God!</p>

  <p>"Give me the spear and keep accelerating? I will help you pass through the rest of the journey as soon as possible. This will not last for long,"</p>

  <p>Xun said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Why can't it last?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Xun sneered and said, "That bitch, how could she let me keep extracting this energy from the Pool of Faith continuously?"</p>

  <p>That explanation cleared it up for Luo Luo Zheng. He took out the Cold Plum Blood Spear and handed it over to Xun?</p>

  <p>After Xun took the Cold Plum Blood Spear, she wielded it in a glittering arc and calmly said, "Turn around and get ready!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng understood what Xun wanted him to do. With a sudden twist of his body, he went upside down and his entire body curled up into a ball.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xun brandished her Cold Plum Blood Spear and ruthlessly hacked downwards at Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng's body suddenly straightened as both of his feet stepped on the spear and pushed forward with an extreme force that propelled him forward at an incredible speed!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh? "</p>

  <p>In this instant, with the momentum gained from the Cold Plum Blood Spear shooting down at him, Luo Zheng's speed was at its limit as he surged downwards?</p>

  <p>Many supreme worlds away from the Dark World, Yao had a faint smile fluttering on her face. Her ten-foot long dress trailed behind her on the pristine ground.</p>

  <p>Behind Yao came a finely-dressed man of the Demon Night. He had silver hair, a handsome appearance, and a lean and lanky body. The biggest difference between him and a human warrior was his long, pointed ears. By the standard of the aesthetics of the Demon Night race, whether or not one's ears were straight up was one of the most important beauty indicators?</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night were mostly women, and they were usually more talented than male warriors in the group. Thus, in the various supreme worlds where the Demon Night members existed, there were very few men who had achieved the cultivation level of a world lord. This man had a cultivation equivalent to that of a powerful world lord, and was thus considered even more accomplished and rare.</p>
