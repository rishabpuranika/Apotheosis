<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1209 The Secret Of Visualization </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>A warrior could turn his life vitality into something substantial by meditation and visualization.</p>

  <p>Take for example a saber: if a warrior wanted to turn his life vitality into a saber then he would have to spend a lot of time observing and contemplating the blade. The greater his concentration and the longer his visualization, the more powerful the life vitality saber would be.</p>

  <p>However, this kind of visualization was based on the life vitality. The more real the thing the warrior imagined, the more real the object transformed from the life vitality would be.</p>

  <p>Without any life vitality, a saber could never hope to take shape no matter how hard the warrior tried to visualize it.</p>

  <p>According to Brianna, if one hundred trillion creatures gathered together and visualized an object, then that object could be formed through sheer willpower alone. It was something beyond Zheng's imagination and comprehension.</p>

  <p>"You mean we can form a legendary weapon just by imagining it?</p>

  <p>Without the help of life vitality?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It's not strange," Brianna huffed. "Being the faith of the Genuine Dragon, the Ancestral Dragon can let the Genuine Dragon race become prosperous after being born in this world."</p>

  <p>"You can regard the Ancestral Dragon as your faith, but why did you let an Evil Dragon be born? Could it be that many members of the Genuine Dragon race have taken the Evil Dragon as their faith?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Brianna shook her head. "How would that be possible? Who would be silly enough to do that? All creatures in this world have both light and dark sides within them. The Evil Dragon represents the dark side of the Genuine Dragon race, similar to hell. It seems that you have no idea that the entire hell came about from the contemplation of all creatures of the universe."</p>

  <p>Her words shocked Luo Zheng even more.</p>

  <p>The Netherworld River, the gate of hell�</p>

  <p>He would never expect that the hell had been formed through nothing but meditation and imagination. It seemed that if one really tried hard to imagine an object, it would really appear and exist in the physical plane.</p>

  <p>Thoughts were powerful and people should probably be more careful with what they imagined in their minds. The universe truly had a lot of surprises in store.</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon roared in fiery rage as flames rose from its huge head.</p>

  <p>The strong man's attack was nothing to the beast but he still angered it.</p>

  <p>"It's going to spit dragon's breath! Hank, tie it up!" the man with the silver mask ordered.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>Green threads began to spiral and twine around the Evil Dragon, tying its mouth shut instantly. With the dragon's mouth shut, the strong man was able to get close and continue attacking the beast with the huge sickle in his hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up at the dragon. "It seems the Evil Dragon isn't that powerful. The seven Celestial Position members are only at the Spirit Supreme Realm but it doesn't seem to have the ability to resist them."</p>

  <p>"The Evil Dragon has to undergo seven transformations to reach the true extent of its power. It seems that it has only undergone three. If it can go through the fourth transformation, then it will become so powerful that none of the members of the Celestial position would be able to defeat it.</p>

  <p>This is for the best. They're actually helping you kill it. If they let the Evil Dragon be alive then it would definitely eat the great world and undergo the fifth transformation," Brianna replied.</p>

  <p>"Eat the great world?" Luo Zheng repeated. He hadn't had the time to explore the secret of the world's will despite being fused by it, but now that he had become the son of the plane, he wouldn't be able to stand by and just let some dragon eat the great world.</p>

  <p>"Don't concern yourself too much with the Evil Dragon. Now that they're busy dealing with it, you should take this as a chance for you to escape."</p>

  <p>And Brianna was right. Initially, the Celestial Position members had no intention to kill Luo Zheng or any of the other insignificant Soul Sea Realm warriors. They were as good as bait in their eyes but if they couldn't attract the Evil Dragon, then there was no need to bother.</p>

  <p>However, the Celestial Position members were called Zero-Homers.</p>

  <p>They even tried to stop the reincarnation. The divine kingdom warriors would most likely be killed after the Evil Dragon was dealt with.</p>

  <p>Escaping was the only choice for Luo Zheng at this point. As for Fiona, Callan, and the others of the divine kingdoms, he would have to find another way to rescue them.</p>

  <p>"These seven warriors are all at the Spirit Supreme Realm and I am currently controlling your physical body. How can I escape?" he asked, looking around hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"Except for Max, all of them are just at the early stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm. I know you can only use a bit of my strength but I can teach you an escape skill. You should gather and employ my life vitality later and leave as quickly as you can!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng figured that he didn't really have a choice but to learn this new skill and use it to run away. It seemed that it would give him a better chance of escaping than just merely making use of Brianna's life vitality.</p>

  <p>Brianna used her consciousness to pass a pithy formula to Luo Zheng. "This is a wind travelling skill. My life vitality is compatible with the wind travelling mind method but how much of it you can comprehend and master is all up to you!</p>

  <p>This wind travelling skill is called Cloud-chasing Skill! It is based on the legendary beast, the Cloud-chasing Lion which is second only to the Celestial Mouse in terms of speed. If you master at least thirty-percent of the skill, you'll be able to escape when they're not looking. Just remember the pithy formula� Dharmakaya of cloud, moving one thousand miles a day, searching at high speed, reaching the heavens and the netherworld..."</p>

  <p>The Cloud-chasing Lion?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a bit surprised when Brianna imparted the wind travelling skill to him.</p>

  <p>Back when he managed to obtain a section of the Cloud-chasing Lion's bone, he transplanted it to the Hundred Meetings Platform. After that, he gained the ability to move as fast as the Cloud-chasing Lion but since the bone was used for the body refining skill, it would only reveal itself when the forceful energy erupted.</p>

  <p>Forceful energy and life vitality were two different kinds of energy but their basic qualities were similar. Coupled with the fact that his current talent was extremely great, it wasn't difficult for Luo Zheng to comprehend the Cloud-chasing Lion's wind travelling skill.</p>

  <p>His soul quietly floated in Brianna's mind and gradually grasped the skill.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Brianna's soul stayed in the interior world, silently staring at Luo Zheng. She didn't expect him to master it in such a short time. The Cloud-chasing Skill was extremely difficult to grasp and he would still need to comprehend the Wind Law. However, since she knew her physical body was compatible with the skill, then maybe it would be enough for her to help him escape.</p>

  <p>""Bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon moved irritably, its battle with the seven Celestial Position members in full swing.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"How much of the skill have you mastered?" Brianna didn't think he'd grasp much of the skill in a mere five minutes. It would be enough if he could activate the Wind Law of her life vitality.</p>

  <p>"I think I've mastered it," Luo Zheng said, flashing her a bright smile. To some extent, this skill was tailor-made for him. He was sensitive to the Cloud-chasing Lion's talent and this skill was created based on the legendary beast. Brianna imparting the skill to him made him gain a new comprehension for it.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon let out a deafening roar as it broke free from Hank's grip, it's body rising out of the large hole and into the air.</p>

  <p>"Vincent! Grab it and drag it back here!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let it run away! Dorothea, release the confining power!"</p>

  <p>Brianna's eyes flashed at the scene. "Now! This is the best time to escape. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Brianna's interior world began to shake as an intangible power covered her physical body, expelling Dorothea's confining power.</p>

  <p>Once the confining power was dispelled, Luo Zheng immediately felt his soul connect to Brianna's physical body. He wasted no time mobilizing Brianna's life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Dorothea remarked, suddenly realizing that her confining power had been negated. Turning her attention away from the Evil Dragon, she saw Zheng's figure float like the wind and disappear with a flash.</p>
