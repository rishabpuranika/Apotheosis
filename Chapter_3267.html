  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, who was being carried by Luo Zheng, laughed. She knew that the Ear Mice were shrewd, but this was too shameless.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Ling Shuang suddenly said, "It's time for you to get off. It's indecent for you to lie on a man's back for so long."</p>

  <p>She was unable to contain her jealousy any longer.</p>

  <p>Offended by Ling Shuang's rebuke, Feng Ge glared at her before slowly asking,</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you? What does any of this have to do with you?"</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge couldn't see Ling Shuang's face, she didn't recognize her. She thought Ling Shuang was a disciple from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Few disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace dared to catch her attention.</p>

  <p>"You!" Ling Shuang raised her eyebrows as outrage coursed through her. She was about to call to Luo Zheng but stopped when she remembered that she couldn't reveal his identity. Instead, she held back and pinched Luo Zheng's arm. "Hey! Put her down!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't focusing on the two women as he didn't expect them to argue over such a trivial thing.</p>

  <p>He glanced at both women as he tried to figure out what was going on.</p>

  <p>Chaim chuckled before responding, "We're family. Princess Feng Ge, this is Ling Shuang. She helped us earlier."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you." Feng Ge was stunned.</p>

  <p>"So what?" Ling Shuang seemed as imposing as Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was unwilling to back down. She leaned her head against Luo Zheng's shoulder and deliberately said, "My soul force has been drained. As I have no strength left, I can't come down!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was taking soul pills the entire time that Luo Zheng carried her. Although she had lost a considerable amount of soul force, she had now replenished most of it.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang knew that Feng Ge would be dishonest about her soul force.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Ling Shuang said, "The Grand Sky Temple is going to open soon.</p>

  <p>Since you lack soul energy, you should leave the Other Shore and rest. You must take care of yourself. The temple is a very dangerous place."</p>

  <p>As soon as Ling Shuang finished speaking, Feng Ge jumped off Luo Zheng's back. She was so fast that everyone was astounded. Even from her Soul of Light, one could tell that she was flexible. She replied coldly, "Thank you for your concern. I can replenish my soul force."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she took out a few more soul pills and absorbed them into her Soul of Light. At the same time, her soul rapidly filled with energy.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, the Grand Sky Temple is a perilous place. As you are a princess, perhaps you'd better not enter it," Luo Zheng rationalized.</p>

  <p>Both Chaim and Feng Ge were not included in Luo Zheng's plan. However, the Grand Sky Temple would surely attract the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and the conflict caused by Feng Ge was something that Luo Zheng had not expected.</p>

  <p>"I can take care of myself. I'm not as fragile as someone," Feng Ge said sarcastically as she glared at Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang raised her eyebrows and readied herself for a scathing retort, but Luo Zheng reached out and pinched her arm. So, she bit her tongue. After all, she hadn't come to quarrel with Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had used the Soul Interdicting Water to seal the area in front of the Grand Sky Temple and imposed restrictions. The large races that had paid the soul pills lined up at the temple gate as they waited to enter.</p>

  <p>The arrogant and aggressive members of the Separate Abyss race fell silent as soon as Luo Zheng appeared.</p>

  <p>As most of them had come from Stage Eleven, they had witnessed Luo Zheng grow to over ten thousand feet tall. Since they were terrified of Luo Zheng's physical body, they didn't dare to provoke him.</p>

  <p>After the other races had completed their preparations, an Ear Mouse climbed the stairs in front of the Grand Sky Temple and stretched its thin claw, which was marked with long and thin lines.</p>

  <p>As it tapped the gate with its claw, the gate flashed with metal luster before it slowly opened.</p>

  <p>The other races appeared anxious. Everyone wanted to enter the temple first, but as the Ear Mice had imposed restrictions in this area, the members from the other races had to follow their orders.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can enter now," said the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>As soon as it finished speaking, the gigantic Souls of Light of the Separate Abyss race rushed into the temple.</p>

  <p>The other races also dashed forward, one after another.</p>

  <p>In stark contrast, the Ear Mice stood by patiently. They didn't seem to be in a hurry, even though they had opened the door.</p>

  <p>More than two thousand Souls of Light had gathered at the gate of the temple. In a flash, almost every Soul of Light had entered the temple.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go in?" Ling Shuang prompted Chaim.</p>

  <p>As she hated the princess, Ling Shuang couldn't wait for Chaim to escort Feng Ge inside.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang had been with Luo Zheng ever since she had entered the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Jealousy coursed through her at the thought of someone else vying for Luo Zheng's attention.</p>

  <p>However, Chaim, Feng Ge, and the other disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace thought that it was the best to follow Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng didn't move, they stayed put as well.</p>

  <p>"I have reached an agreement with the Ear Mice. I can only take Ling Shuang into the temple with me," Luo Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>Among all the creatures here, only Luo Zheng and Ling Shuang hadn't paid the soul pills.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge fixed her gaze on Luo Zheng. She was a straightforward woman. Since he did not intend to explore the temple with her, she decided to proceed alone.</p>

  <p>Chaim cupped his hands and bowed before Luo Zheng and Ling Shuang. Then, he said,</p>

  <p>"If that is the case, we will enter first. Thank you again for saving us!"</p>

  <p>"There's no need to be so formal about it," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>After the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace entered, Luo Zheng walked up the steps too.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Ear Mice surrounded him. One of them asked respectfully,</p>

  <p>"What's your name, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Just call me Tianxing," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice knew that Luo Zheng wouldn't give them his real name, so they didn't pressure him. One of them asked, "Since you came to the Other Shore with your corporeal body, you must have some extraordinary talents. I wonder if you can destroy the Grand Sky Temple."</p>

  <p>"You want me to destroy the Grand Sky Temple?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no trouble breaking the Sacred Mallow Temple on Stage One. The Bearing race's temple on Stage Four and the buildings on Stage Eleven were not a challenge either.</p>

  <p>However, he was unsure if he could destroy the Grand Sky Temple on Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to study the building. The temple glowed with a faint metallic luster as though it had been infused with a special metal during its construction.</p>

  <p>He walked to the door, pressed his hand against the wall, and slowly released his strength.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The wall was apparently more solid than Luo Zheng had expected. Even though he employed fifty percent of his strength, only a fingermark was left on the wall's surface.</p>

  <p>"As the wall is five feet thick, it will be difficult to destroy," Luo Zheng surmised.</p>

  <p>When the Ear Mice saw this, ecstasy appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable! You left a fingermark on the wall!" one Ear Mouse praised.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"The way to the Dark Region is blocked by a wall. It is not as solid as this one. Since you have such strength, you will be able to destroy it easily," the Ear Mouse explained.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Ear Mice were not in a hurry was that they knew that no Soul of Light could destroy that wall.</p>

  <p>They had completed their preparations before entering the Grand Sky Temple.</p>
