<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought admitting he had killed her son would make her furious.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, however, any resentment she did have seemed to disappear in the blink of an eye and she was calm again.</p>

  <p>The expression of the beautiful woman in red made Luo Zheng restless and uneasy.</p>

  <p>Something didn't feel right when he was captured by the old man in black.</p>

  <p>If the old man really wanted to kill him to avenge Marco's death, he could have done it on the Taiyi Mountain and Luo Zheng would not have been able to fight back. If there really were people secretly protecting Luo Zheng, even they would not have been able to get to him in time.</p>

  <p>But the old man had brought him here. The people of the Vastness Mountain had to be up to something.</p>

  <p>"Marco was my favorite son. You have to give me an explanation for his death," the woman said coolly.</p>

  <p>"An explanation?" Luo Zheng retorted, his eyebrows raised and his voice rife with derision. "He tried to kill me on several occasions. This time, at the Ripple Pavilion competition, he lured me into the arena and tried to kill me again.</p>

  <p>If he wasn't so weak, I'd be dead. And now you want an explanation? Are you kidding me?"</p>

  <p>"Even if what you say is true, it's not you who died, but my son," she replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>It sounded somewhat reasonable.</p>

  <p>Marco had lost his life, while Luo Zheng stood here safe and sound. Relatively.</p>

  <p>It seemed rational enough that his mother had him brought here, wanting an explanation.</p>

  <p>"Enough beating around the bush. What is that you want?" Luo Zheng asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>The woman stood up and strolled gracefully to Luo Zheng's side. Her gaze was so sharp that it seemed as if she could see through him. Finally, she revealed her true intention. "I heard that you stood out in the Seven Mountains Meeting and showed extraordinary strength. It seems that your victory had something to do with the Truth of Godly Way, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still and silent.</p>

  <p>"The runes that Athemar created are all made of the Imperial Sword Seals.</p>

  <p>Even if you are a genius capable of Instant Enlightenment, you should not have performed as you did. What did you rely on?" she asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng finally understood her purpose? she wanted the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>He sighed inwardly at her quick change in attitude.</p>

  <p>She didn't appear sad at all. It seemed that Marco's life or death didn't really mean anything to the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was right.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had many concubines and even more direct descendants. So did the leader of Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Phoenix Palace had even more disciples than the Flow Sword Sect. The ones in high regard were either those with incredible talent or those favored by Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Feng Ge was one of them.</p>

  <p>The Vastness Mountain was not much different. Gethin was born in the Xu Clan of the Clear Lake and had stayed in the Bloom Divine Province for almost as long as Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He had been the head of the Vastness Mountain for countless years and had tens of thousands of sons.</p>

  <p>His sons had more sons still and these were all his direct descendants.</p>

  <p>Marco was one of Gethin's favorite sons, but still not as important as Feng Ge was in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>"I relied on my strength," Luo Zheng replied seriously.</p>

  <p>The woman focused her gaze tightly on Luo Zheng, a faint flicker of disappointment in her eyes. "You're very strong. It really is quite impressive that you killed Lazlo, Drystan and Grayson on your own. However, Athemar's Imperial Sword Seal is very special. It's activated by the truth aura and has nothing to do with one's strength," she said, still smiling.</p>

  <p>She could not hide her motives anymore. "I heard that there is a subsequent chapter to the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, and it is the most important.</p>

  <p>But it has never been deciphered before. Now, it seems someone has indeed done it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged and looked at her dully. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>The woman stretched out her hand, and a piece of yellow paper appeared in it. On the paper were more than twenty words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng managed to catch a glance of the words, which happened to be the beginning of the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>He had already revealed one hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment. Athemar, Winchell, Goran and Master Hai would give the chapter to their disciples. It shouldn't be difficult for the Vastness Mountain to get their hands on it.</p>

  <p>It had in fact taken a great deal of effort for the Vastness Mountain to procure the twenty-odd words.</p>

  <p>Athemar, Winchell, Goran and Master Hai paid great attention to the Truth Enlightenment. Even though they had one hundred and fifty words in their hands, they didn't reveal all of them at once. For example, Winchell only gave the one hundred and fifty words to a few direct descendants of the Origin Mountain, while the elite disciples only had the twenty-odd words.</p>

  <p>And the Vastness Mountain got the twenty-odd words from some elite disciple.</p>

  <p>"These twenty-odd words are part of the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but they're not enough. According to our research, there should be at least a thousand or two thousand words in total. And you have them," the woman said as she walked behind Luo Zheng. "Hand over all of them and I will let you go. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>She wanted him to give her the complete Truth Enlightenment in exchange for her forgiveness. She must be out of her mind.</p>

  <p>The Truth Enlightenment was very important. It was after all part of the foundation of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. He would give it to the palace if the right opportunity presented itself. He had hoped to exchange the chapter for the support of the palace or maybe for the palace to support the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>But this was definitely not the right time.</p>

  <p>The woman wanted the complete Truth Enlightenment just because Luo Zheng had killed her son. That was not a deal worth taking.</p>

  <p>"It was me who deciphered the twenty-odd words."</p>

  <p>After much restraint, Luo Zheng finally admitted it. The eyes of everyone in the room lit up, revealing their judgment was well-placed.</p>

  <p>"But I've only deciphered a hundred and fifty words in total, and I've handed them to Master Athemar. If you want, I can write them down," Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>Since the one hundred and fifty words had already been released, sooner or later, they would be passed down like the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent to the entire Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples, and even to all the humans. He didn't mind writing them down again.</p>

  <p>"That's not enough," the woman said, staring intently at Luo Zheng with a devilish smile. "I want the complete version."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders, embarrassed. "That's not possible. I haven't deciphered the complete chapter myself. How can I give it to you?"</p>

  <p>The woman shook her head and said, "I don't believe you. There are only two ways for you to get out of this. Either you write down the complete version yourself, or..."</p>

  <p>She flicked a glance at the men in black robes.</p>

  <p>One of the men stepped out of the line. A shadow appeared above his head, green mist rose and a green arm faintly materialized from it.</p>

  <p>"It is an Other Shore Token from Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. It's called the Soul Searching Hand. He won't hurt your soul. However, he is able to shuffle through your memories, bit by bit, with the Soul Searching Hand," she said with a grimace.</p>

  <p>The Divine Dao such as the Great Dominance Technique had little effect on the powerful Other Shore Realm warriors. As long as Luo Zheng resisted, it would be difficult to search his soul.</p>

  <p>However, there were some Other Shore Tokens that were able to deal with warriors' souls, and one of them was the Soul Searching Hand.</p>

  <p>In the face of the green Soul Searching Hand, Luo Zheng's face darkened.</p>
