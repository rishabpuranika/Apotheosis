<br/><br/>

  

  <p>It did not take a long moment before Zheng had arrived at the sixth row, easily surpassing Dylon.</p>

  <p>Who knew which row Zheng would eventually manage to reach in the end?</p>

  <p>Among everyone at the Tower of Sin, this fact was undeniable; Dylon was the most talented disciple from the Purple Heart Sacred Place besides Olivia. Although it was clear as day that his talent was not as good as Olivia's, Dylon was already well aware of this notion and acquiesced to it.</p>

  <p>Ever since he was a young child, Dylon had always considered Olivia as the only other warrior who could match him when it came to strength.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Olivia had also been the woman in his heart for the longest time.</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, that bastard named Zheng appeared out of nowhere and stole everything Dylon once had and yanked the rug under his own feet. To his displeasure, it seemed as if Zheng was replacing him.</p>

  <p>In the Purple Heart Sacred Place, Olivia was regarded as nothing short of a noble and superior goddess. It was borderline ironic however, as much as she had kept herself aloof from Dylon, her behavior towards Zheng as well as every single thing he did was the exact opposite. The woman had been unwaveringly enthusiastic about his endeavors and exuded such patience with him that it made the whole thing laughable; how could she not see that the guy was extremely cocky? The fact that Zheng was given the attention that he had always wanted made extreme jealousy bubble up Dylon's chest.</p>

  <p>Therefore, every time Zheng's name came up one slot on the stone tablet, Dylon gritted his teeth in annoyance and barely suppressed trembling with frustration.</p>

  <p>The Space Law on the stone tablet had proved to be of great help to Zheng.</p>

  <p>According to what he just learned from it, the mastery of the first layer of the Space Law could enable the cultivator to travel through space, hence why it was termed as 'traveling'. After being able to comprehend the first layer of the Space Law, an individual could travel a short distance that made it possible for the cultivator to attack the enemy before he knew it and consequently take him by surprise.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the second layer of the Space Law was called 'tearing'. If one managed to completely comprehend the second layer, then that individual could easily be able to tear apart space itself. What happened was that the fractured space would form cracks--which could not only help in blocking all attacks, but it could also form a powerful space blade. The cultivator could use the space cracks as a form of weapon and shoot them out according to their will.</p>

  <p>It was obviously a good opportunity for Zheng to be able to comprehend the second layer of the Space Law, so he must seize the chance and throw himself into studying it right away. Determined to succeed, Zheng focused his undivided attention on comprehending the Space Law on the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, things started to go wrong in the middle of him trying his best to master the second layer of the Space Law. If he was given enough time, Zheng would be able to completely master it.</p>

  <p>However, after less than a quarter of an hour, he stared disbelievingly at the stone tablet which had begun to gradually vanish before his very eyes!</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" he muttered to himself, blinking his eyes in surprise at the disappearing tablet.</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng was left speechless and unable to put coherence to his thoughts. 'What's going on with this Talent Tablet?' he contemplated, truly bewildered by this sudden change when it completely faded away.</p>

  <p>The time given to Zheng was too short for him to do anything useful.</p>

  <p>Despairingly, he sighed at the reality that he had only comprehended about ten percent of the second layer of the Space Law!</p>

  <p>In a desperate moment of hesitation, Zheng thought that he would rather give up the test of the Talent Tablet in exchange for the chance to comprehend the second layer of the Space Law. Unfortunately, the Talent Tablet was already gone from the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"Is this the end of the test?"</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered to himself, scanning his eyes from side to side.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng's voice faded away, the dark space surrounding him began to morph itself and change its form once again. In the blink of an eye, beams that reflected brilliantly colorful lights started to shine from every direction.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Within the sudden commotion, a crack materialized in front of Zheng, which he immediately assumed was a space crack.</p>

  <p>The exact moment the space crack became visible, it instantaneously shot towards Zheng at the speed of lightning.</p>

  <p>With a jolt, he noticed that it was a sight that could definitely induce fear and anxiety due to its appearance akin to the mouth of a monster. Moreover, its movements seemed like it was trying to devour Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Zheng's figure suddenly flashed. Sighing in relief, he was lucky he had managed to avoid being consumed by the space crack--he had no desire whatsoever to know what would have happened to him if he did not evade in time.</p>

  <p>With his heart pounding in his chest, he asked himself, "Is this also a part of the test?"</p>

  <p>Doubt was visibly shown across Zheng's face. Biting his lower lip unconsciously, he came upon the realization that perhaps this was meant to test up to what extent he had comprehended the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng had assumed that the Talent Tablet contained some secret method that could directly assess a warrior's talent and then promptly produce the result after. At that moment, however, it seemed that Zheng's idea was just plain naïve. Ultimately, Zheng took note of the fact that talent originally referred to one's ability to comprehend something.</p>

  <p>It went without saying that the ability of comprehension varied from person to person. Adding to this, people had different preferences, as well as speed, when it came to learning the same thing.</p>

  <p>However that might be, what was marvelous about the Talent Tablet was its ability to automatically and consistently discover each person's strong point.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was dedicated in giving them something to comprehend according to their respective strong points. After a period of time, the Talent Tablet tested the effectiveness of their comprehension. Through this method, it could determine the rank of the examinee's talent without preamble.</p>

  <p>For example, if an individual was particularly good at Fire Law, the stone tablet he chose would most probably contain the Fire Law. Due to this, the specific test for the examinee would involve the constant attacks by all sorts of fire.</p>

  <p>"But, such test is still not accurate." Zheng hummed and pouted as he shook his head vehemently.</p>

  <p>Just now, Zheng had just employed the power of the first layer of the Space Law and traveled for a relatively short time to dodge the space crack that came at him just a moment ago. Despite that, Zheng was certain that it had nothing to do with his talent and he believed that his success was attributed to his real strength in cultivation.</p>

  <p>In spite of everything, Zheng had underestimated the power of the Talent Tablet!</p>

  <p>Not a long moment had passed before more space cracks began to appear from all directions Zheng could see. Abruptly positioning himself to get ready, he knew that when those space cracks fully emerged, he only had a split of a second to evade before they all came ferociously to crush him. In an instant, it was as if hundreds of monsters in the shape of a huge mouth were suddenly materializing in the darkness.</p>
