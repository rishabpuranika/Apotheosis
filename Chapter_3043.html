<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3043 Sword-reading Liquid </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Carlisle finally said, "It... It's the Sword-reading Liquid. We can use it to improve the compatibility degree in a short time."</p>

  <p>"It can improve the compatibility degree?" Zheng stared at Carlisle with eyes beaming with wonder. "Do you have any of it in your possession?"</p>

  <p>Carlisle was reluctant but he didn't dare to defy Zheng. He nodded to him, reached for a small jade bottle from his space ring and passed it over to him. "This is all I have."</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately pulled the cork from the bottle.</p>

  <p>A pure yet distinct aura of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent emanated from the jade bottle and flared up in the air.</p>

  <p>"Someone has infused the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent into the liquid,"</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered as he studied it carefully.</p>

  <p>Beldene noticed something and said, "This truth aura is quite similar to yours."</p>

  <p>Beldene had sensed it instantly since he and the other disciples had previously fought Zheng in the Truth Competition. The truth aura that resonated from Zheng's body was quite similar to that of the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, Zheng realized something as his eyes widened noticeably.</p>

  <p>If one had a low compatibility degree with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, they could still take advantage of others' truth auras.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Oneness Sky Palace turned a blind eye to this method.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible to make the Sword-reading Liquid by myself?" Zheng asked while tilting the jade bottle, and eyeing it up.</p>

  <p>Carlisle shook his head in response, "No. Those who can make the Sword-reading Liquid must have a perfect fit with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. They are all talents capable of Instant Enlightenment. An ordinary warrior can't make the Sword-reading Liquid. My clan bought it at a high price."</p>

  <p>"You mean, if I have a perfect fit with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, I can make the Sword-reading Liquid by myself?" Zheng continued to inquire more.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," Carlisle said shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult to obtain the Sword-reading Liquid. It was capable of improving the compatibility with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Naturally, it was expensive to buy. With such a high price, ordinary people were unable to afford it. Most people would only use it to pass the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>"How many divine crystals is this bottle of Sword-reading Liquid worth?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked while weighing the bottle in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand divine crystals, nothing more nothing less," replied Carlisle.</p>

  <p>The other disciples gasped in unison after hearing the massive amount.</p>

  <p>As two influential clans that laid the foundation stone for the Sword Light Palace, the Qiu Clan and the Yuebai Clan could not afford the expensive Sword-reading Liquid. It was too pricey even for them.</p>

  <p>The disciples desired to have the Sword-reading Liquid, but now they even gave up the thought of it after knowing the price. Their cultivation palaces would never spend twenty thousand divine crystals on them.</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred disciples. To supply each with a bottle of Sword-reading Liquid meant spending over two million divine crystals which were an unattainable figure.</p>

  <p>"I will be keeping this bottle of Sword-reading Liquid. Do you have any problem with that?" Zheng asked curtly.</p>

  <p>The corners of Carlisle's mouth twitched with hesitation. Although he was the young master of the Wang Clan, it made his heart sink to give the Sword-reading Liquid to Zheng for free.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't refuse Zheng. He remembered the way Zheng had killed Jagger. Moreover, the Oneness Sky Palace didn't bother to investigate his death. Carlisle himself had never passed the trial of the Sword Wall so he was of no significance to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," Carlisle answered as he bit his lip and clenched his fists.</p>

  <p>After handing the Sword-reading Liquid over to Zheng, Carlisle turned around and wanted to leave with his people.</p>

  <p>"Did I permit you to leave?" Zheng said, raising his eyebrow.</p>

  <p>Carlisle sighed as Zheng stopped him in his tracks. His troubles were not ceasing to end. He composed himself by thinking Zheng would soon die.</p>

  <p>Slowly he turned his head around to face Zheng. "What else can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Are all the Sword-reading Liquids here the same as yours?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>There were twenty to thirty thousand people at the foot of the Sword Wall hoping to pass. Most of them sent out a feeble truth aura. Zheng thought it was difficult for them to pass due to not being able to afford the pure Sword-reading Liquid. After all, ordinary people could not afford twenty thousand divine crystals for the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. The purity of the Sword-reading Liquid is different. Those diluted ones are not expensive," said Carlisle in an arrogant tone.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any diluted Sword-reading Liquid? Let me have a look," Zheng requested while reaching his hand out and signaling him to hand it over.</p>

  <p>Carlisle thought to himself, 'Does he plan on ordering me all the time?' He thought for a while, tightened his jaw and said, "Yes, I do. Will you let us go if I give it to you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," Zheng shrugged and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>Carlisle nodded and then winked at a man next to him. Instinctively the man handed him a small jade bottle. Carlisle passed it over to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the bottle and eyed it up. When he was convinced, he casually waved his hand to signal Carlisle to leave. Relieved from the burden, Carlisle hurriedly turned around and left with his men.</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled the cork and felt the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent emanating from the Sword-reading Liquid. "The truth aura in this bottle is significantly weaker," Zheng said as he felt it.</p>

  <p>Kenelm, Beldene and other disciples came up to surround him.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, we know we are not talented enough to pass the Sword Wall. The Sword-reading Liquid is too expensive. Don't waste it on us," Kenelm urged him.</p>

  <p>The disciples had already given up the wish of passing the Sword Wall to reach the Oneness Sky Palace. They were touched when they saw the efforts Zheng was putting in for them. He had already done enough for them.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had no intention of giving up.</p>

  <p>He smiled confidently to them and said, "Although I don't know the formula for the Sword-reading Liquid, I believe it is to absorb the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent using some kind of liquid. I don't have the liquid, but I do have this."</p>

  <p>At his words, he put his finger on the mouth of the jade bottle and tapped it lightly. An aura was formed in a spiral shape. It was his Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>The truth aura reacted to his command and circled his palm. Then it swiftly went inside the small jade bottle.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what the liquid was, but it had reacted to his truth aura and smoothly fused with it as the liquid inside began to rotate.</p>

  <p>"Close enough." Zheng felt the change in the bottle and smirked to himself.</p>

  <p>What made the Sword-reading Liquid expensive was the perfectly matched truth aura. The liquid itself held no such value. After the liquid was done, the maker had to fuse the truth auras of talents with the liquid.</p>

  <p>Such talents demanded high prices. Therefore, the Sword-reading Liquid sold high.</p>

  <p id="top_13">"Here you go," Zheng said as he tossed the jade bottle gently into Kenelm's hand. "It should be the same as Carlisle's."</p>

  <p>"It's the same as yours?" Kenelm said, looking baffled. He stammered, "But this is too much. I can't use it. Zheng, you'd better sell it. It's worth twenty thousand divine crystals!"</p>

  <p>With this bottle of Sword-reading Liquid, Kenelm was likely to pass the Sword Wall. But as Zheng said, it was worth twenty thousand divine crystals.</p>

  <p>He didn't feel right in using it for himself. It was too huge an amount for Kenelm to process. His hands trembled with the Sword-reading Liquid in his possession.</p>
