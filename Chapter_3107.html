<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3107 Blood Sun Crows </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even as he was preoccupied with killing the Sharp-winged Sun Crows, Maxim couldn't help but observe Zheng's movements.</p>

  <p>The longer he watched Zheng, the more astonished he became.</p>

  <p>Even though it looked like he was fighting casually, Zheng's attacks spared no target.</p>

  <p>Even more shocking was the fact that while Zheng was dealing with his own opponents, he managed to look after Rupert, Alfie and some others as well!</p>

  <p>If any of them missed a target and a Sun Crow managed to break through the defense line, Zheng would calmly strike it down before it was able to hurt anyone.</p>

  <p>To test his theory, Maxim intentionally let some Sun Crows break through.</p>

  <p>Just as the crows would make it past the defense line, in the blink of an eye, a sword radiance from Zheng's direction would instantly slash through them.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe this!' Maxim shook his head in awe.</p>

  <p>He felt a wave of shame come crashing down on him, as he never expected a man in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm would render him, an esteemed Oneness Guard, inferior. He knew that the others would laugh their heads off if they knew how he felt, but that didn't stop the inferiority complex from clawing at his heart.</p>

  <p>Despite of this, Maxim also had an overwhelming feeling of hope knowing Zheng was on their side.</p>

  <p>With Zheng, the others could focus on using their most powerful theurgies without having to worry about their own safety. Reassured of their safety, Maxim proceeded to concentrate on channeling his power to defeat the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>With this chemistry, the area they were guarding was practically invincible.</p>

  <p>However, the situation of the other areas wasn't as good.</p>

  <p>The casualties began to pile up as more and more Sharp-winged Sun Crows flocked towards the city. Although more Oneness Guards showed up to join the fight, the situation was not in the human race's favor.</p>

  <p>"Blood Sun Crows are coming!"</p>

  <p>"Retreat! Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Let Oneness Guards deal with them!"</p>

  <p>Thousands of scarlet-colored crows filled the skies.</p>

  <p>The Blood Sun Crows were covered with flame-like feathers which were stronger than iron. There was no way ordinary warriors would be able to deal a force such as this!</p>

  <p>As the Blood Sun Crows circled the sky preparing to attack, all the Oneness Guards mobilized. Now was the real battle between the two parties' elite warriors.</p>

  <p>Three strong Blood Sun Crows shot towards the Oneness Guards, their piercing screams filling the air.</p>

  <p>"Illusory Maple Leaves!"</p>

  <p>Rupert released his strongest move without hesitation when he saw the Blood Sun Crows approaching.</p>

  <p>In a flash, layers of sword radiances in the shape of maple leaves folded together to form a flaming sword. With Rupert's eyes narrowing determinedly, he urged the sword forward to meet one of the Blood Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>The Blood Sun Crow flapped its thick wings, blocking the incoming attack.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The Blood Sun Crow emerged from the smoke, unharmed.</p>

  <p>"What?" Rupert gasped, stunned at the result.</p>

  <p>While he was fully aware that the Blood Sun Crow was extraordinarily powerful, he didn't expect his strongest move would leave no effect on it.</p>

  <p>As he turned desperately to his teammates, he realized he wasn't the only one in trouble. Alfie and the others were caught in the same situation. Even with their coordinated attacks, they couldn't break the defense of the Blood Sun Crows. It was as though their solid wings were unbreakable!</p>

  <p id="top_17">As their expressions fell, the three Blood Sun Crows flapped their wings towards them.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Hundreds of red feathers shot towards them swiftly.</p>

  <p>The power contained in these flying feathers was no less than that of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, these feathers were not living creatures and couldn't change their directions freely as the Sharp-winged Sun Crows. Rupert and the other warriors could defend themselves from harm. However, that wouldn't be the case for ordinary blades.</p>

  <p>Even though Rupert, Alfie and the others were able to parry the feathers, their hands couldn't help but shake in fear.</p>

  <p>"Leave the Blood Sun Crows to me. You can deal with the other Sun Crows,"</p>

  <p>Maxim ordered. Crushing dozens of divine crystals, he let his Other Shore Token absorb their energy. Rupert glanced at him worriedly, as he noticed that Maxim's other Shore Token was already consumed. Nevertheless, he trusted Maxim, and retreated to fight the other Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Maxim charged towards one Blood Sun Crow, yelling at the top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>Maxim knew himself and his capabilities. He was confident he could deal with one Blood Sun Crow. Maybe two would be a challenge. However, he knew he wouldn't be able to handle three simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Every Oneness Guard knew to stand their ground. If death called, they would embrace it.</p>

  <p>Maxim was not alone; the other Oneness Guards might even have it worse, needing to deal with four or five at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Snowstorm Twining!"</p>

  <p>Maxim released violently cold intent to slow down the Blood Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>But the feathers on the wings of the Blood Sun Crows were like hundreds of iron swords, all aimed at Maxim.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Rounds of crimson feathers shot towards Maxim. As he dodged the blade-like feathers, he kept an eye out for an opportunity to strike back.</p>

  <p>Once it came, he seized the moment to draw his sword. He swung it with precision, and the Blood Sun Crows backed off momentarily as they gathered to attack collectively.</p>

  <p>Although he was no newbie to swordsmanship, he was no match for the three crows gathered before him.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As Maxim instinctively dodged the volley of feathers, he noticed one of the Blood Sun Crows suddenly darting upwards. It was about to engulf him with its wings completely!</p>

  <p>Facing this pair of blade-like wings, Maxim gritted his teeth as he made a split-second decision.</p>

  <p>Without dodging, he channeled all his power into his sword.</p>

  <p>"Even if I have to die here, I will kill one crow! Otherwise, it would be too shameful to live!" he cried as he rushed towards the crow.</p>

  <p>As Maxim charged towards his death, he suddenly felt a strange force surge from behind him. This force did not come from the Other Shore Power, but from the power of Godly Way. He was not familiar with such a power.</p>

  <p>This strange feeling lingered in his heart. Suddenly, a dazzling white light exploded above his head, temporarily blinding him. The energy released by it left him dazed and confused.</p>

  <p>'Who did it?</p>

  <p>One of my colleagues?</p>

  <p>A two-star Oneness Guard or a three-star one?' Maxim thought to himself.</p>

  <p>When his vision and wits returned and the light faded, he realized that the Blood Sun Crow he was about to strike was headless, blood messily spurting out of its neck. The crow that once seemed so menacing now lay lifeless on the ground.</p>

  <p>Frightened, the other two Blood Sun Crows nervously flapped their wings backwards. Even nonhuman creatures such as them could feel fear.</p>

  <p>When Maxim whipped his head around to see who saved him, he was stunned. "What? It's you again..."</p>

  <p>This marked the second time Zheng had saved his life in such a short amount of time. Maxim wanted to thank him, yet was too embarrassed. He was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>Having narrowly escaped death again, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry, or both. Briefly, he reflected on how he had ordered Zheng to leave that time he visited the Grand River Fortress to pick up his followers. If Zheng had obeyed him back then, Maxim would have been dead by now.</p>

  <p>"You were willing to die with that animal? Tsk, tsk," Zheng taunted playfully with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>As he walked towards Maxim, layers upon layers of Ways-blending Energy flashed on the surface of the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Rupert, Alfie, and the others who witnessed Zheng's strike just now all dropped their jaws, flabbergasted at what just happened.</p>
