  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whether or not the Heart of Accomplice was unique, its ability was undeniably terrifying.</p>

  <p>The three Hearts of Accomplice could take the place of any three peerless masters.</p>

  <p>It could be a remarkable killing weapon for any super force.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng, Ling Shuang, and the Ear Mice could feel the excitement bubbling up within.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice, in particular, were more excited wondering how many Hearts of Accomplice Luo Zheng would give them. A single one or all the three? Was there any way to fight for more?</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng took another step forward, moving closer to the hearts, an enormous face suddenly appeared atop the wide passageway.</p>

  <p>It was a hideous face? something like a piece of a dirty rag. Two dark holes served as its eyes.</p>

  <p>"Aha!"</p>

  <p>The ugly face whimpered as the blood vessels? what were formerly attached to the ceiling of the passageway? rolled up and down like spiraling vines, forming exactly eight bloody vortexes.</p>

  <p>Well aware of how dangerous the nineteenth passageway was, Ling Shuang and the Ear Mice knew to be more vigilant once they sensed any foreign movement within the vicinity.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the bloody whirlpools, they all backed away while Luo Zheng stood unmoving, staring at them.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Eight enormous bloody hands reached out from the spinning whirlpools, moving towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng felt the onset of a crisis as he sensed the bloody hands' aura.</p>

  <p>While his body was undoubtedly strong on the Other Shore, he knew that he was by no means invincible.</p>

  <p>A warrior's physical body couldn't simply enter the Other Shore since the banning of the Ancient God Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>Where had the Wild Gods all gone? Those who had entered the Other Shore with their physical bodies?</p>

  <p>A Wild God had limitless longevity.</p>

  <p>At the time, there were as many Wild Gods as there were True Gods now, spreading across the entire Source World. But now, not a single Wild God could be found. Neither on the Other Shore nor in the Source World had anyone even seen a glimpse of a Wild God. It was indeed unreasonable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reckoned that some methods existed on the Other Shore that could suppress the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>In a flash, a bloody hand shot at Luo Zheng right before he managed to raise his hands and block the attack.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>In spite of his defense, the bloody hand still landed a blow on Luo Zheng's body, sending him flying across the passageway and onto a wall.</p>

  <p>"As I suspected..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he leaned against the wall, taking a second to recover.</p>

  <p>The bloody hand's power must have reached up to at least 300 Jun, going way beyond Luo Zheng's expectation.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing..."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice's eyes were wide in surprise as they saw how Luo Zheng was thrown onto the wall. To them, Luo Zheng was someone undefeatable. But seeing how he failed to resist the bloody hand, the Ear Mice thought that perhaps no one in the entire Source World could defeat it.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng...' Ling Shuang was lost in thought at the sight. It was the first time she had ever seen Luo Zheng suffer such a loss with his physical body.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha?"</p>

  <p>The faces in all sizes on the walls began making horrible sounds, indistinguishable from crying or laughing.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," Luo Zheng said as he pushed himself off from the wall and walked toward his attacker.</p>

  <p>While normal warriors on the Other Shore couldn't have hoped to still be breathing after being attacked by 300 Jun of force, it only made Luo Zheng's blood surge.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that he couldn't use the Shade Stone, or he could've easily taken 600 Jun of force? 300 would have been nothing.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice found themselves releasing a breath of relief at Luo Zheng's response. If they had been attacked like that, their Souls of Light would have been destroyed instantly? the gap between a physical body and a Soul of Light was far too wide.</p>

  <p>"Waaah?"</p>

  <p>The great face above the passageway saw Luo Zheng approaching once again and howled in warning.</p>

  <p>What else could it possibly do to frighten away the warrior?</p>

  <p>After taking a few more steps, Luo Zheng kicked off, his body rushing towards one of the bloody hands like a shot arrow.</p>

  <p>Woosh!</p>

  <p>That bloody hand was about Luo Zheng's size. As he rushed up, it flipped to land another attack.</p>

  <p>"Strength God Totem!"</p>

  <p>Back when he was in the Heart Flow Sect, the Strength God Totem carried by Luo Zheng's inner world held such an explosive power that in a flash, all things in the room were immediately turned to dust by it.</p>

  <p>Someone as strong as Luo Zheng didn't need to consume too much strength when dealing with a Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>But when dealing with the Abyss Spirit knights, he had had to activate the Other Shore Token's power.</p>

  <p>The bloody hands before him were not to be trifled with? Luo Zheng had no intention of underestimating them.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Unable to use the Shade Stone, Luo Zheng didn't dare release the entirety of the Strength God Totem's power. It had already given out 500 Jun of force now.</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore, such a great force was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Sensing the high pressure from the great power, the Ear Mice had no choice but to retreat? their Souls of Light were already feeling uncomfortable under the pressure and tension.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>When the bloody hand collided with Luo Zheng's physical body, a mass of blood plasma burst.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just caused a great hole in the center of the hand.</p>

  <p>"Waah -"</p>

  <p>It wailed in pain.</p>

  <p>After being struck down, it began trembling as the face on the passageway cried out harshly. The other seven bloody hands then came at Luo Zheng from different directions in retaliation.</p>

  <p>"That's what you get!"</p>

  <p>Having the upper hand, Luo Zheng could feel the corners of his mouth turn up in amusement.</p>

  <p>Since no one in the temple could leave the Other Shore, Luo Zheng was well-prepared before even entering the area. He had already filled many divine crystals into his Other Shore Tokens before even stepping inside.</p>

  <p>So now, the Strength God Totem's power was abundant enough? Luo Zheng had no hesitation when drawing out the Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>He was going rapidly back and forth now, dodging every bloody hand and striking a great force from his every body part. His elbows and fists struck right through the bloody hands, breaking their wrists with every hit.</p>

  <p>The face atop the passage couldn't stop shrieking in pain.</p>

  <p>"Ahahah..."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Luo Zheng had broken the eight bloody hands.</p>

  <p>Six of them were drawn into the blood vortexes, while two had been cut off cleanly, wriggling on the ground like a lizard's tail. Gradually, they lost all vitality.</p>

  <p>"Done!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng called in triumph as he turned back to Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice then came out of hiding, squeaking as they flittered to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Take back the two bloody hands too!" one of the Ear Mice said as it pulled out its space ring.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Luo Zheng called out suddenly, "I cut those hands, so I will take them."</p>

  <p>When the Ear Mice had collected those broken bones earlier, neither Luo Zheng nor Ling Shuang felt the need to say anything about it. The two weren't there to collect bones, after all. They cared nothing about the soul pills or divine crystals that the Ear Mice were crazy about.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng decided to turn a blind eye to the bones the Ear Mice had picked up, the two bloody hands were both rare and precious? Luo Zheng couldn't simply hand them over.</p>
