<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"They're just as stupid as other ordinary beasts..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's hand shot out and grabbed at a Silver Moon Wolf's head.</p>

  <p>The Silver Moon Wolf's reaction, however, was extremely quick, and with a haphazard roll, it managed to evade Zheng's attack. As soon as it righted itself, it roared and clawed at Zheng's face. It had discovered that Zheng's body was indestructible, so it shifted his attention to Zheng's face instead. The other three Silver Moon Wolves bit Luo Zheng, intent on drawing him away.</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>A trace of surprise appeared on Zheng's face before he let out a sinister laugh.</p>

  <p>The power of the nine stars gushed out crazily, and with a slight twist of his body, a wave of power formed into a vortex that revolved wildly around him. A cracking sound was heard as the four Silver Moon Wolves got caught in the vortex.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, the heads, fur, and bones of the Silver Moon Wolves were cut to pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood at the center of the remains and calmly waved his hand. A faint light flashed from his space ring and absorbed the fragments of the Silver Moon Wolves.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Karl had also been blown into bits by the Angel of Death from the sorcerer race, but was resurrected by Supreme Lord Lester. Luo Zheng assumed that while Nathan had been devoured by the Silver Moon Wolves, the beasts did not have time to absorb his flesh fragments.</p>

  <p>If the Celestial Position members could separate Nathan's fragments from those of the Silver Moon Wolves, then they'd have a chance to revive him.</p>

  <p>And while it didn't seem very much, this was the only thing Luo Zheng could do. Whether or not Nathan could be saved depended on his own luck.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng slowly descended onto a protruding rock, his gaze landed on the Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>When he was dealing with the Silver Moon Wolves, he had also been on guard for a sneak attack by Maha. However, Maha didn't show up at all causing Luo Zheng to be even more vigilant.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Iron Moon City, a magnificent palace stood. It had been originally the city lord's mansion, but when Maha came to the Sunflower Water World and killed the city lord, the mansion became Maha's palace.</p>

  <p>Inside the mansion, steam rose from a boiling pool of brown water and filled the air with a strong herbal fragrance. The water's temperature, above boiling point, was enough to melt any ordinary being in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, the two naked figures that were currently immersed in the pool were unbothered by it.</p>

  <p>Maha leaned his back on the edge of the pool as he stared absently at the ceiling. Lost in his thoughts, he barely noticed Connie rest her head on the crook of his neck.</p>

  <p>Neither of them used any protective life vitality to resist the heat of the medicinal liquid. The scalding water was hot on their skin but was incredibly refreshing.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng seems to be a bit impatient," Maha said flatly.</p>

  <p>Connie scooped up some water in her cupped hand and gently poured it on Maha's chest. "Don't be careless," she said softly. "He's strong, much stronger than Nathan!"</p>

  <p>Connie had been defeated by both Luo Zheng and Nathan. But while the two men had overpowered her, they gave off completely different vibes.</p>

  <p>She was able to exchange blows with Nathan and she knew instantly that the man was not invincible. If she had gone all out on him, she would have surely beat him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, gave her a completely different feeling. She almost had no strength to fight him back, and had Luo Zheng been serious during their fight, she had no doubt the man could've killed her with a single strike. The pressure she felt then was so much stronger than when she had faced the Supreme Lords...</p>

  <p>Maha caressed Connie's face, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. "Are you worried I won't be his match?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not looking down on you..." Connie hurriedly explained. Maha was a conceited person and she didn't want to say anything that would displease him.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Maha's smile melted of his face and said something uncharacteristic. "I'm not confident about winning the battle with Luo Zheng," he confessed. "I fear he might be the strongest opponent that I'll ever face in my life."</p>

  <p>Under certain conditions, Maha was able to kill a Supreme Lord. And according to what he just said, he believed Luo Zheng was just as powerful as one.</p>

  <p>Connie was stunned. She never thought that Maha, who had always been overconfident, would actually give Luo Zheng such an evaluation. She worried Luo Zheng would kill Maha, and she found herself greatly upset at the thought of losing her lover.</p>

  <p>"But I will definitely win," Maha assured her, his finger coming up to touch her nose.</p>

  <p>He then pulled himself out from the pool and nonchalantly walked to the other side of the room.</p>

  <p>Connie followed suit. With a flick of her wrist, a towel wrapped itself around her body and a robe hung itself on Maha's.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng stood outside the Iron Moon City, calmly surveying the surrounding area.</p>

  <p>The human martial artists, as well as the Sacred martial artists in the Iron Moon City, were also quietly waiting. As world lords, they had vast knowledge and experience. In a vision, they would see the entire universe in turmoil after the battle between Maha and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter the victor, the Sacred Supreme Lords hiding in the Sunflower Water World would all take action.</p>

  <p>"If Luo Zheng really succeeds in killing Maha, then the Sacred Supreme Lords would take revenge on him!"</p>

  <p>"We're fully prepared. If the Sacred Supreme Lords aren't afraid of death, then they can launch the attack!"</p>

  <p>"I am ready to lay down my life for the Evolutionary Universe!"</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the Evolutionary Universe understood the current situation and were more than willing to defend their home. After the invasion of this universe, none of the warriors from the human race and other races stayed silent. This was a matter of life and death, and concerned all living beings in the universe.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the city lord's mansion opened its gates and a lone figure walked out.</p>

  <p>Maha was fully dressed now. The smile that hung on his face moments ago was gone and was now replaced by a serene expression.</p>

  <p>When veteran warriors faced a battle of life and death, they all had this calm Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>From the palace garden, Connie's lips pursed unconsciously as she watched Maha walk away. "Maha hasn't been this serious in a long time."</p>

  <p>Although she had confidence in Maha's strength, there was an extreme feeling of worry that she just couldn't shake off.</p>

  <p>Because of Zheng's gruesome attack, the Sacred martial artists present kept quiet out of fear. They deduced that only Maha had the chance to defeat such a formidable talent like Luo Zheng. At this time, they looked forward to seeing Maha more than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Do your best, Maha! Kill that Godly Genius!"</p>

  <p>"Avenge us!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has a powerful ice flame in his hand. Be careful, Maha!"</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artists marched beside Maha as he walked along the road, giving him words of encouragement and caution.</p>

  <p>Maha nodded his head once in response before he took a step forward and instantly appeared at the top of the hill.</p>

  <p>He eyed Luo Zheng warily from his place. "This is the third time we've met."</p>

  <p>For the first time they met, there wasn't anything remarkable about Luo Zheng, and Maha was able to defeat the boy with just a finger. For the second time they met, Luo Zheng had improved greatly. Maha had wanted a Supreme Lord to kill him then, but by sheer dumb luck, Luo Zheng had managed to escape.</p>

  <p>Now that he had crossed paths with Luo Zheng for the third time, he couldn't help but notice the sense of danger growing in his heart. He tried to suppress the feeling as it only reminded him that this person had the strength to kill him.</p>

  <p>Maha also understood that he couldn't wait any longer. Luo Zheng had progressed quickly. Even when Maha went to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to cultivate before, he hadn't improved as much as Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>If he missed this opportunity to kill Luo Zheng now, he'd be facing an undefeatable monster in the future!</p>
