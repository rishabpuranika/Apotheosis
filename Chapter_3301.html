<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had been consuming the Other Shore Power all the way. At this point, his power was almost completely exhausted.</p>

  <p>Even in the last part of his journey, Zheng continuously exploited the Strength God Totem, as well as the Other Shore Power of the Eye of Will. After finally exhausting both, he began exploiting the power of his own physical body.</p>

  <p>In the end, he ended up exhausting his physical strength. His body was like an empty bottle when he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Before she was able to finish her words, Feng Ge was startled by Zheng's fall.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, what's wrong?" she asked, her anxiety rising.</p>

  <p>Rarely, perhaps even never, had Zheng seen himself in such a weak situation.</p>

  <p>While his strength was waning, his mind was still as sharp as always. "I'm fine?just exhausted."</p>

  <p>"Exhausted?" Feng Ge certainly wasn't expecting that. "How can this be?"</p>

  <p>In theory, after reaching the True God Realm, a warrior would never deplete their strength.</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore Power was used up, the Godly Ways' internal momentum could be used. Once this was used up, life vitality could take its place. But what happened once life vitality was used up as well? One's inner world would probably collapse.</p>

  <p>Zheng's situation was unique? after the Other Shore Power of both his Other Shore Tokens was exhausted, they were now absorbing Zheng's own energy.</p>

  <p>Two enormous whirlpools stood by the exit of his inner world, preventing Zheng from utilizing the internal momentum and power of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng found it difficult to even open his mouth? he gave up explaining things further to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The black monkeys that were hiding in the distance saw Zheng fall clearly with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>It was a dangerous area in the depths of the narrow ravine? even the black monkeys didn't dare to rush in mindlessly.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was right on the verge of it.</p>

  <p>Originally, the monkeys were already planning to give up. But now that Zheng was lying on the ground, barely able to move, they knew they had to take their chance.</p>

  <p>Only a few steps into the ravine, they could catch him? they just had to make sure not to wake up the big creature inside.</p>

  <p>"Crunch!"</p>

  <p>"Creak!"</p>

  <p>After a short discussion, three of the black monkeys tiptoed their way inside.</p>

  <p>Afraid of disturbing the creature staying deep in the ravine, they moved as stealthily as they could.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I'll be fine after resting for a bit." Zheng reassured her.</p>

  <p>The power of his Other Shore Tokens was restoring very slowly, but it wouldn't take long for his body to recover. Then he would have just enough strength to move and walk on his own.</p>

  <p>"I want to let you rest but I don't think the black monkeys will be nice enough to wait," Feng Ge said bitterly, glancing back at the three monkeys who weren't too far away.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned? he had no energy to check the situation himself. "Did they enter the ravine? Didn't you say they wouldn't dare step inside?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge shook her head bitterly. "We might not be deep enough inside.</p>

  <p>There are three of them walking to us."</p>

  <p>"We're in trouble," Zheng said with a bitter smile. He was at a loss for what to do.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyes flashed with golden light? a strong desire to survive grew within her heart.</p>

  <p>In all the time she'd been in the Dark Region, she had relied on Zheng for protection. Now, it was time to rely on herself.</p>

  <p>"Nope!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she grabbed Zheng's hand and let her soul energy burst before pulling him toward the narrow stream.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, Zheng's body would have been nothing to her.</p>

  <p>But on the Other Shore, it was quite heavy for her Soul of Light. She could only depend on her soul power to drag Zheng's body along.</p>

  <p>Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was dragged on the ground. From where he lay, he could see Feng Ge's movements.</p>

  <p>Though he couldn't see her expression, he could tell she was exerting a great amount of effort to keep on dragging him.</p>

  <p>"Just leave me here. You can go ahead on your own. The black monkeys wouldn't dare chase you inside," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" Gritting her teeth, she continued. "They didn't dare come in here because of the danger awaiting them deep in the ravine. If you were captured? I would die alone here."</p>

  <p>"But I can't protect you anymore," Zheng said helplessly.</p>

  <p>Without another word, Feng Ge kept dragging Zheng into the depths of the ravine.</p>

  <p>The three monkeys didn't expect her to go so far in. They were creeping into the ravine quietly and steadily, but at that pace, they wouldn't catch up to her.</p>

  <p>"Squeak?"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>After stopping for a moment of discussion, they were ready to risk everything.</p>

  <p>If they ran as fast as they could, they could catch up to Zheng in mere seconds.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the monkeys accelerated, reaching for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Their change in pace had Feng Ge rattled.</p>

  <p>She could barely resist the weaker human-monkey monsters with her Soul of Light, let alone these ten-foot-tall black monkeys.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Feng Ge felt no urge to escape. Her cold, hard eyes widened, and golden divine flames began emerging on the surface of her body, turning into golden whips that lashed at the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>This soul attack was considered quite a powerful means in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. Only the best of superpowers could withstand it.</p>

  <p>But in these black monkeys' eyes, such an attack was nothing? even if they were defenseless, Feng Ge couldn't hurt them at all.</p>

  <p>But right before her golden whips slashed them, they began screaming, as though the whips somehow scared them. Their faces grew full of fear before they turned back and ran away.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>She wasn't expecting them to run away so quickly. Did the divine flame of the Sun Crow race somehow repel them?</p>

  <p>But before she could figure it out, black, brown, and gray tentacles emerged from behind her, one after another. In an instant, there were hundreds of them, covering up almost the entire space in the ravine.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The creeping tentacles looked like running black water as they went around Feng Ge and rushed toward the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>While they were running at great speed, the tentacles were faster.</p>

  <p>"Cluck!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak..."</p>

  <p>"Quack..."</p>

  <p>Soon, they were entangled in the tentacles and dragged into the depths of the ravine, leaving behind only sharp roars that echoed in the space.</p>

  <p>When it went quiet, Feng Ge was still standing in her spot, petrified.</p>

  <p>The touch of the tentacles skimming over her soul surface made her Soul of Light tremble in fear. But why did they leave her and Zheng behind?</p>
