<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 598 The Unboxing Of Surprises (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the light on the stone carving became dimmer, she realized that Luo Zheng had comprehended the power of space reflected from the stone carving and was really contemplating the space laws.</p>

  <p>Like the cyan blue stone carving inside the Cloud Hall, the power of space contained in this type of stone carvings was not infinite. When the cyan blue stone carving was rich in the power of space, it would emit a faint light. But the light would become dimmer once the power was mediated by an elder. Upon its depletion, the power of space would be restored naturally by the stone carving. But only after the restoration could one really proceed with the mediation.</p>

  <p>This was just the reason why strict time limits were set upon contemplating on stone carving in the Cloud Hall. These time limits were respected by everyone who contemplated the stone carving.</p>

  <p>The same phenomenon was true for the defective gold carving. In the course of Zheng's mediation, the golden light over the stone carving was dispersing. This only meant that Luo Zheng had comprehended some of the space laws and the power of space had been constantly consumed.</p>

  <p>At first, Tia had intended to satirize Luo Zheng. But at that moment, Tia was only amazed by what Luo Zheng was doing. She had forgotten about satirizing Luo Zheng. Right now, she became more impressed by Zheng's talent. Deep in her mind, she was reevaluating the potential of this young guy.</p>

  <p>When she first met Luo Zheng, Tia merely perceived him as top talent from a grade two sect. Although he looked as though he only had relatively mediocre accomplishments in cultivation, he exhibited fairly great potential for future development.</p>

  <p>After all, everyone who was eligible to step onto the Death Road was among those with great potential. Among several people who had started their journey on the Death Road, Frank was the most outstanding. Apart from him, all others such as Tianming, Patrick, Lewis, and Lois could not be underrated either.</p>

  <p>But after Luo Zheng showed his Heavenly Ogre Fist and the perfect sword intent, Tia assessed that Luo Zheng could outperform Frank.</p>

  <p>All the power that Luo Zheng had was totally beyond Tia's imagination. Now that Luo Zheng could even comprehend the power of space, Tia believed that even the top disciples from the most powerful grade five sects would be no match for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In Tia's book, there were very few talented figures in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>And in the past years, no disciple there had been found to be especially gifted or outstanding. So, how could such an extraordinary person like Luo Zheng be suddenly cultivated in a grade two sect? This puzzled Tia a lot. In the assessment of Cloud Hall, the disciples in the Eastern Region lagged far behind those in the Central Region in terms of inheritance of cultivation methods and distribution of resources.</p>

  <p>It was like participating in a long-distance race where one had already failed at the starting point. The Eastern Region had nothing to brag about with other regions.</p>

  <p>"Now, I remember! The fiery dragon spirit wasn't killed by me! But why..." Tia's eyes widened as she realized that she had overlooked that.</p>

  <p>Earlier when she was fighting against the fiery dragon spirit, Tia mistakenly took some overpowering drug. As a result, she was not quite conscious and thus unable to resist attacks of the fiery dragon spirit. She didn't know what happened next after she lost her consciousness. When she came back to her senses, the fiery dragon spirit was already dead and only Luo Zheng was with her. Now that she remembered it wasn't her that killed the fiery dragon spirit, it was Luo Zheng after all.</p>

  <p>Over so many years, Tia had never been so intimate to any man. Luo Zheng was the only man that she had ever been physically attached to. She couldn't help but blush every time when she remembered her moments with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But she didn't want him to know, so she tried to forget those times.</p>

  <p>Hence, she unconsciously overlooked all about the death of that fiery dragon spirit.</p>

  <p>Remembering those times, Tia's face became red and she felt embarrassed to look into Zheng's eyes. She took a deep breath to regain control over her body.</p>

  <p>Tia still had a doubt about the death of the fiery dragon spirit. She thought that no matter how mighty Luo Zheng was, he couldn't have been able to confront and defeat the huge fiery dragon spirit with his current cultivation level. But now that the fiery dragon spirit was dead, was it really killed by Luo Zheng? How was that even possible?</p>

  <p>Tia knew that Luo Zheng wouldn't reveal the truth unless she asked him. But whatever it was, Tia was sure that there was still something she didn't know about Luo Zheng. This intrigued her so much that she wanted to get to know him better.</p>

  <p>'This young guy will surely enjoy great fame in the world in the future...'</p>

  <p>Tia mumbled to herself in a daze as she stared at Luo Zheng who was still seriously contemplating the golden stone carving.</p>

  <p>After quite a while, the light over the stone carving was getting dimmer until it finally completely vanished. It left Zheng's eyes stained with a tinge of the golden color. Apparently, he had substantially comprehended the space laws.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly turned his eyes away from the golden stone carving to Tia.</p>

  <p>He subtly smiled and spoke to Tia, "What did you say?"</p>

  <p>To sneer at Luo Zheng, Tia would have said, "You've figured out what it is again?" However, what Luo Zheng had just accomplished slapped Tia on the face. Tia could do nothing but snort coldly as a response to Zheng's question. By that moment, it had become useless and meaningless for her to further dispute over Zheng's strength. Without formally replying to Luo Zheng, she shifted her attention to another gold treasure box and opened it.</p>

  <p>When she opened the gold treasure box, she found an array pattern which was for protecting the grade six sect.</p>

  <p>It was useless for Luo Zheng but would be of great value for Tia. With this array pattern, the Cloud Hall would become more powerful in defending against its enemies. But it would be uneasy to deploy an array to protect the Cloud Hall. Tia showed it to Luo Zheng and told him what it was used for.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised no objection to Tia's possession of this array pattern.</p>

  <p>Although it was helpful for protecting a sect, it was of no value for him.</p>

  <p>By now, there was only the final unopened box, the black treasure box.</p>

  <p>With all the wonders they had seen so far, Tia's hand was still shaking.</p>

  <p>The gold treasure boxes proved to have far more valuable items than those of the first boxes they had opened. Now that they were moving onto their last box, a black treasure box, Tia's expectation became higher.</p>

  <p>What could be more valuable than those in the gold treasure boxes?</p>

  <p>Tia examined the box first. On the outside, this black treasure box looked a little weird. All other treasure boxes were either red, blue, white, or gold. Only this one was colored black.</p>

  <p>If there were some gears or magical spells inside the treasure box set by the emperor himself, both Tia and Luo Zheng would be in danger.</p>

  <p>But as Tia carefully pulled the lid of the black treasure box, they saw a swarthy oil lamp inside.</p>

  <p>Tia pulled it out and looked at it closely. It looked nothing special, but was like the small oil lamps used by ordinary families. Luo Zheng also looked at it closely while Tia was holding it. He was still baffled when he saw that Tia's eyes became wide in astonishment again.</p>

  <p>"This is the enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb!"</p>
