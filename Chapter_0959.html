<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Luo Zheng was only at the Virtual Tribulation Realm as of now, Master Xiao knew the relationship between him and Ning Yudie all too well.</p>

  <p>It was promising that Luo Zheng might eventually become the core leader of the Cloud Hall. Furthermore, Master Xiao wanted to have a chance to ask Luo Zheng for help in arranging a sect-protecting array. However, he encountered some dilemmas in doing so. First, it was difficult for him to turn to Luo Zheng for help. Second, he was not related to Luo Zheng in any way and he was also not his friend. Then again, it was fortunate that he was able to become acquaintances with him, and he therefore promised himself that he would be able to find a better opportunity to speak up next time.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a purplish black stream of light rapidly flew across the sky. Within the span of mere seconds, it had already traveled several miles.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng's moving speed was extremely fast, it would still take him a couple of days to arrive at the Cloudy City. In order to reach the Cloudy City as soon as possible, he then planned to redirect his route. At the present, he was now heading towards the Ethereal City as his first stop, the big city to the east of the Central Region, instead of the Cloudy City itself.</p>

  <p>In reality, the Cloudy City was built with the support of the Cloud Hall, while the Ethereal City relied on the sustenance of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. As for the headquarters of the World Commercial Alliance, it was located in the Oracle City. As a matter of fact, there was an even bigger sect behind every prosperous city.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there were transmission arrays set up in these large cities that were accessible. If Luo Zheng could use them to pass through the Ethereal City this time around, it would take him a significantly less time to get to the Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>After two days had passed by, Luo Zheng successfully arrived in the air above the ancient city.</p>

  <p>If the Oracle City was considered to be the most prosperous city in the entire Central Region just because of the World Commercial Alliance, then the Ethereal City would be regarded as the most ancient city in the Central Region. This was due to the fact that the Ethereal Spirit Sect had a much longer history than that of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng approached the Ethereal City and hovered above in the air, he could easily view the skyline of the city which was filled with magnificent ancient buildings. Furthermore, the buildings had some historical allusions to them. In fact, there were various ancient poems and phrases that mentioned their existence. All in all, it was undeniable that the Ethereal City was indeed a famous city in history.</p>

  <p>Advancing towards his destination, Luo Zheng sensed a no-fly ban in the area.</p>

  <p>It was said before that the restriction in the Ethereal City was set by Arnold, but it was destroyed afterwards. After that, the Ethereal Spirit Sect spent a huge amount of money in hiring numerous runic experts to set up the no-fly ban once more.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, he could choose to ignore this no-fly ban.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, after contemplating by himself for a while, he shrugged and decided not to cause any unnecessary trouble and promptly descended onto the main road. Without much preamble, he began to walk towards the territory of the Ethereal City.</p>

  <p>In the distance, several armored warriors could be seen standing at the entrance of the city. Those guards were also constantly observing the individuals who entered and exited the gate.</p>

  <p>Given the system of the ancient city, the ordinary mortals wandering about without even a shred of life vitality in their bodies could freely explore the premises. However, if they happened to be warriors, they would then be instantly stopped for questioning.</p>

  <p>The moment that Luo Zheng walked over with his head raised high, a hand signaled for him to stop as the armored warriors noticed his presence.</p>

  <p>Apparently, these armored warriors were mere nature creatures. With wary expressions visible across their faces, they gave Luo Zheng a careful once-over and realized that they could not figure out Zheng's cultivation level.</p>

  <p>As their postures wavered because they became confused, one of them politely addressed him, "Hey. There is a rule in the Ethereal City that we have to check on which sect or clan each warrior belongs to. Independent warriors are not allowed to enter the city." The young warrior hesitated before continuing, "May I ask which sect or clan you are from?"</p>

  <p>As of the moment, all of the large sects were trying their best to limit the living space of the independent warriors. Even the Ethereal City had prohibited the independent warriors from entering the city and made sure that they did not go too far. This was basing from the terrible experience that there were some places where the city members had a big conflict with the independent warriors and even killed hundreds of independent warriors.</p>

  <p>"That is to say that an independent warrior is not even allowed to enter the city, right?" Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow, slightly affronted by the news.</p>

  <p>He felt annoyed and was in disbelief by the reality he had to face. In this case, the independent warriors had no other choice then aside from joining those sects.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's how it is here," the armored warrior stated with a grin.</p>

  <p>Appraising him over once more, he then continued, "You also know the current situation in the Central Region, right? If you happen to be an independent warrior, I can help you find someone to invite you to join the Ethereal Spirit Sect. With your powerful strength, you can surely join it."</p>

  <p>Just then, the armored warrior observed that Luo Zheng briefly hesitated and seemed to ponder over something, so he immediately assumed that Luo Zheng was truly an independent warrior.</p>

  <p>With an immediate shake of his head, Luo Zheng faintly grinned before dissenting, "Thank you for your good intentions. However, I am a member of the Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>"The Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>The armored warrior's eyes flashed with unbridled surprise at what Luo Zheng had just uttered. "Can you prove that you are one of its members?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked down and lightly tapped the ring hanging on his chest, taking out a token from inside the ring and bringing it up for every one of them to see. The disciple card that Luo Zheng acquired after joining the Cloud Hall seemingly gleamed in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>Humming to himself, the armored warrior pretended to look over the token several times. Truthfully, he was not from the Cloud Hall, so how could he ever determine if the disciple card the young man had showed them was actually real or fake? However, even if he was putting on an act as he scratched his chin in fake contemplation, he still had to try his best to check it.</p>

  <p>In fact, there were several stubborn independent warriors who were unwilling to join a sect and continued to live on their own terms. Despite of this, these same individuals also had to enter these large cities to deal with their things. Because of this, they had no choice but to entrust others to make counterfeit copies of the disciple cards of those sects.</p>

  <p>After examining the token for a while, the armored warrior passed the disciple card back to Luo Zheng with an affirmative nod. As the group of armored warriors made way for Luo Zheng to pass through, Luo Zheng nodded as well before finally entering the Ethereal City.</p>

  <p>In this ancient city, the streets that adorned the town, as well as their assorted delicacies, were all distinctive. Upon feasting his eyes on the unique structures and famous treats, Luo Zheng did not rush to the transmission array. Instead, he strode towards the famous Moon Pavilion in the Ethereal City as he planned to rest for a short while before continuing with his journey.</p>
