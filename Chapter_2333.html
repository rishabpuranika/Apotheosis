<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2333 Dangerous Situation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everything seemed to move in a blur as the Abyss Demon suddenly seized the mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>As soon as the True God came to his senses, he struggled frantically in an attempt to escape the Abyss Demon's clutches.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon however, was like a giant snake that had coiled around its prey. No matter how hard the mid-rank True God struggled, he couldn't get rid of its grip. There was nothing he could do except watch as the Abyss Demon raised the flame sword and stabbed it into his chest.</p>

  <p>"Whap..."</p>

  <p>The flaming sword pierced the mid-rank True God's chest. Blood spurted out from his gaping wound before the blazing flames vaporized it. Soon enough, the fire had completely engulfed the mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhhh!"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon raised its flame sword while the mid-rank True God's body still writhed in the middle of it, his shrill cries filling the humid air.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, his screams stopped and the mid-rank True God's body turned into ashes and drifted away in the wind.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>The ground shook as the Abyss Demon waved its sword.</p>

  <p>Thick smoke billowed in the air as the rising flames rose higher and higher.</p>

  <p>The scorching flames released terribly hot heat waves, which swept over the other True Gods.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Abyss Demon's body glowed with a golden light and it rushed towards the True Gods at an extremely fast speed!</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>"What's going on? It's so fast!"</p>

  <p>Not only was the Abyss Demon immensely fast, it had a very strong defensive power and incredible strength. An ordinary True God could never stand a chance against it. Perhaps, only the consummate True Gods could fight it.</p>

  <p>The golden light around the Abyss Demon shone brighter, and then it broke free from all its restraints. It was finally able to move even faster, and all the True Gods scrambled to dodge in panic.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng's body kept on sliding backward. He gently waved his hands. Then the Grant Sun Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword shuttled back and forth as they tried to hit the Abyss Demon.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud, metallic clang when the two invisible swords collided against the Abyss Demon's hard body. Both swords however, disintegrated.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon didn't care about Zheng at all. It chased after the True Gods at an extremely fast speed and slashed at them with its flame sword!</p>

  <p>Three low-rank True Gods failed to dodge the Abyss Demon's attack, and they ended up being cut in half.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Luckily, it did not necessarily mean that they would die.</p>

  <p>However, the bad thing was that the flame of the great sword came from the Abyss Demon Region, and those who made contact with it even in the slightest bit would be burnt to a crisp. True enough, the faces of the three low-rank True Gods melted away like candle wax as they died, along with their harrowing screams.</p>

  <p>Everyone was truly frustrated at their current situation, but no one else fought the Abyss Demon back except Zheng. Not even Soren and the other top-rank True Gods were confident enough to fight. In any case, they would die if the Abyss Demon did hit them.</p>

  <p>"Waah! Waah..."</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng heard multiple roars from behind him.</p>

  <p>He turned around and saw that another Abyss Demon was covered with a layer of golden light, and then it brandished the huge flame sword in its hand and started to chase the True Gods.</p>

  <p>The other three teams had previously used the same method to fight the Abyss Demons but in the last moments of the fights, each of the Abyss Demons' bodies glowed with a golden light, which made them more powerful!</p>

  <p>"These Abyss Demons will have that ability during the worst times!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed. He raised his head and looked at Soren, who was in a state of panic. "It seems that Soren also doesn't know anything about this. And since the Time Sea Forbidden Land has gotten more difficult, I bet these Abyss Demons are no ordinary ones either…" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Woo, woo, woo..."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Ah..."</p>

  <p>Just as he was trying to strategize a plan, he heard the screams of young girls from the other side.</p>

  <p>He looked around and saw that Aleyna and Nelly failed to dodge and the Abyss Demon had caught them!</p>

  <p>"This is bad!"</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't care less about the Abyss Demon in front of him anymore, and instead dashed towards Aleyna's direction.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon tightly gripped Aleyna's and Nelly's slender waists with its huge hand, their bodies pressed together. It used its other hand to wave its huge flame sword, and it looked like it was going to cut their heads!</p>

  <p>"Aleyna!" Liusu screamed.</p>

  <p>The flame spear that she held moved and sent out a ray of flame spear radiance, which continuously attacked the Abyss Demon's body. The spear radiance was so sharp that it pierced the golden light that enveloped the Abyss Demon's body. The light then repeatedly reflected off its skin and bore small holes.</p>

  <p>Yet, the injury was nothing to the Abyss Demon, and there was nothing they could do to stop it.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Kelsey and Pascal were deeply worried as well.</p>

  <p>"Aleyna!" they both shouted.</p>

  <p>At that point, Pascal leapt into the air and unleashed an extremely powerful force as he ran towards the Abyss Demon.</p>

  <p>Another top-rank True God from the Mu Clan brought out a large saber and proceeded to hack at the Abyss Demon in an attempt to save Nelly.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, their attacks were only like an itchy scratch that didn't do substantial damage to the Abyss Demon.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they were interrupted by someone else's presence.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!" Zheng roared as he launched himself at the Abyss Demon.</p>

  <p>Pascal, Liusu, and the others were slightly stunned but wasted no time and gave way to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nelly and Aleyna squirmed helplessly in the Abyss Demon's hand. It wasn't long before their fear was replaced with slight hope when they saw someone rush towards them at a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the other True Gods had already escaped somewhere.</p>

  <p>They turned around once more, but they only looked at the others with pity. It was bad that those two women were about to die today, but they were secretly glad that they managed to run away fast and dodge the Abyss Demon's attacks.</p>

  <p>"Four Swords!" Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>He ran towards the Abyss Demon while he extracted the strength contained in the Nine Divine Stars in his inner world like mad, which caused the Nine Divine Stars to spin at a high speed. Then, the light they emitted dimmed for a while as well.</p>

  <p>Back in the Arena of Legends, he never used all of his strength to fight the low-rank True Gods, no matter how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>He only extracted only about 30% of his strength to maintain the constant movement of the four swords.</p>

  <p>Now, however, was not the time to hesitate. He quickly pulled out all of his strength source.</p>

  <p>Finally, the four invisible swords showed their true, hideous and dreadful aura in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>"Four swords in one!"</p>

  <p>The four swords were now scattered in different places after Zheng had summoned them. Then with a single thought in his mind, the four swords spun like crazy and fused together into one invisible gigantic sword.</p>

  <p>The gigantic sword was almost the same size as the Abyss Demon's huge flame sword.</p>

  <p>Of course, the sword contained all of Zheng's strength source.</p>

  <p>His strength source had come from Holy Jay, and it was equal to one third of a Holy Being's strength.</p>

  <p>Back when Zheng trained constantly, the nine stars also gradually grew and expanded. Thus, they could contain more amounts of strength source.</p>

  <p>Despite that, however, he did not have the confidence to kill the Abyss Demon.</p>

  <p>If even a top-rank True God couldn't kill it after they'd gone all out, it was impossible for Zheng to kill it with just one sword strike.</p>

  <p>Then again, his goal was to save Aleyna, and not to kill the Abyss Demon.</p>

  <p>"There are cracks on its arm!"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon had been under siege by a group of True Gods for a long time, and the surface of its body was covered in bumps and cracks.</p>

  <p>Zheng carefully observed the Abyss Demon's left arm and found that a large fissure had already appeared at the upper end of it.</p>

  <p>"I should hit its arm!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng had no time to think too much. He controlled the giant sword to attack the crack on its left arm.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Nelly only felt a tremendous force sweeping past their heads.</p>

  <p>It was a horrible force that could terrify people. It seemed as if they would be smashed to pieces if they touched it!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The area was filled with a loud ringing sound when Zheng hit the crack.</p>

  <p>A loud thud followed after the Abyss Demon's left arm, which was as huge as a tree trunk, broke and fell off.</p>

  <p>The two girls fell down when the Abyss Demon's left arm got amputated.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Abyss Demon waved the flame sword with its right hand and slashed towards Aleyna and Nelly. The scorching hot flame sword brushed past them from above their heads, but it managed to burn their hair.</p>
