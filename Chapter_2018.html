<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Murphy's anger only lasted a moment. As a Holy Being who was at the top of the hierarchy among all living beings, he didn't need to be concerned with such an insignificant fellow. So he changed the topic and sneered, "Mike, it's too early to talk about the divine land. Your Evolutionary Universe will perish soon!"</p>

  <p>At the moment, the Evolutionary Universe wasn't looking very optimistic.</p>

  <p>Even if there was no Demon Night, the Sacred race still held the upper hand. This was what Mike and Luo Zheng needed to face right now.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to worry about that. If my Evolutionary Universe were to be destroyed, it would be because of fate!" Mike replied drily.</p>

  <p>"Very good. I hope that you can endure it and live long enough till the day I see your son in the divine land!"</p>

  <p>The energy fluctuations of the transparent giant were becoming weaker by the minute. His voice conveyed by the wind was also becoming stranger and more distorted. The giant formed from Murphy's energy soul gradually dissipated into the world.</p>

  <p>The moment the energy soul disappeared, the Soul-sealing Needle also made a quiet exit from the depths of Ying's soul.</p>

  <p>At this, Yao's legs went soft like noodles, and she collapsed to the ground. Using the Soul-sealing Needle to ask Murphy's energy soul to descend was Yao's last, desperate move. It was originally only used during the final battle between the Demon Night and the humans. But Yao had summoned it in advance to preserve her life and kill Xun.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, the moment Murphy appeared on the scene, another Holy Being also appeared, and he turned out to be Zheng's father.</p>

  <p>Yao could tell at first glance that Luo Zheng was extraordinary, but she had never thought that he was actually a direct descendant of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>All she could do was accept this defeat and as she did so, her vigor drained from her face. Her previously bright eyes were now dim and dull.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched the energy wave dissipate. He suddenly remembered that Mike was still behind him. Shocked and afraid that Mike would disappear too, he turned around and called, "Father!"</p>

  <p>Mike's silhouette did not disappear, but he did not respond either.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was nervous as he asked, "Father, are you still here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Son, I'm here," Mike replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>As a youth, Luo Zheng had never been sensible. He thought that his father had died in the past few years, but he had accumulated too many doubts in his heart.</p>

  <p>Although he had more or less understood a few things, he still had questions.</p>

  <p>Mike's energy soul started to shrink with the violent energy fluctuations.</p>

  <p>The outline of the shadow became more and more solid. When it became the size of Zheng's figure, Luo Zheng could make out Mike's appearance from the silhouette.</p>

  <p>He almost cried out loud when he saw his father's heroic appearance.</p>

  <p>Now that he had experienced the trials and tribulations of life and death, Luo Zheng had a state of mind that had become firm as steel. He knew that all negative emotions were useless and had completely abandoned these emotions in order to become stronger.</p>

  <p>Yet, standing in front of his father, he couldn't help but feel that he was still that frail child.</p>

  <p>Mike looked guilty as he saw the expression on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The energy soul that he had kept in the universe could give Luo Zheng more guidance. But be it in the divine land or in the universe, one had to rely on themselves to reach a higher level of martial arts if they wanted to go further or even surpass Mike.</p>

  <p>So he had no choice but to create the illusion of death, creating one crisis after another to trap Luo Zheng within. He watched Luo Zheng struggle with all his might, like an injured beast, licking his wounds time and time again as he became stronger.</p>

  <p>He was happy that Luo Zheng had not disappointed him and had even performed better than he had expected. He also knew that doing so was too cruel to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Come with me." Mike turned around and waved his hand. An illusory gate appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>The door looked like the entrance to a heavenly palace, but it also looked like a mirage, slowly floating before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mike was the first to step into the gate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng jumped up from the ground and looked back at Xun. "Wait for me," he said, his lips barely moving.</p>

  <p>Saying thus, he went through the gate.</p>

  <p>Once the father and son disappeared through the door, it closed and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Xun's gaze fell on Yao's body, and she laughed coldly. "Looks like we have to settle the score again!"</p>

  <p>Yao had her Soul-sealing Needle broken in order to have Murphy descend. And when Murphy's energy soul had disappeared, Ying's Soul-sealing Needle had also disappeared. At the moment, both Ying and Yao only had the strength of an ordinary grand world lord. It was up to Xun now.</p>

  <p>What was more, there was an Ancestral Dragon in the Rosy Cloud World.</p>

  <p>Xun did not let Yao live because of the irreconcilable conflict between them. She knew that if she spared Yao's life, Yao would become a great danger to her in the future, which was why she decided to kill her.</p>

  <p>Xun did not make things difficult for Ying.</p>

  <p>After all, the rebellion that Ying had led was because of the Soul-sealing Needle. She wasn't malicious by nature. And Xun had relied on Ying's spirit embryo in her Pool of Faith at the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the Saint Lords of the seven sacred places of the Rosy Cloud World, and the members of the Board of Elders of the Demon Night were all gathered in front of the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>The Inauguration Altar that symbolized the supreme power of the Demon Night, was now in ruins, with the three Pools of Faith buried deep within them. Only after the people of the Demon Night race had dug them out did they see the light of day again.</p>

  <p>Two of the Pools of Faith were already empty. Only the pool belonging to Xun had red water in it.</p>

  <p>The water in the Pool of Faith had to be accumulated over many years.</p>

  <p>The elders understood that now that only one queen remained in the Demon Night, it was likely that the time of the three queens' reign over the Demon Night would never reappear.</p>

  <p>Because of Yao, the Demon Night had been exhausted from the upper echelons all the way to the bottom. But with Xun's return, the situation was finally under control.</p>

  <p>There were two Supreme Lords in the Demon Night who had accompanied Yao and Ying to battle. They had chosen to leave because of the queen's decree that Leroy had issued on Xun's behalf. And under Xun's summons, they had quickly returned to Rosy Cloud World.</p>

  <p>Thus, via her statue, Xun issued another queen's decree ordering all of the clansmen to band together.</p>

  <p>She knew that the Demon Night was an alien race that Murphy had created. However, Mike had appeared and hadn't pursued the issue of the Demon Night's origins. After all, with the disappearance of the Soul-sealing Needle, the Demon Night would not be able to rebel.</p>

  <p>Mike must have realized this, and as a result, recognized the position of the Demon Night in the universe. Since they were part of the Evolutionary Universe, they would naturally attack the Sacred race when necessary.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stepped through the door, he saw a golden scroll spread out on the ground, extending far into the distance and forming a path of golden light.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?" Luo Zheng glanced around.</p>

  <p>"This is the path of heavens," replied Mike. His faint shadow continued to move forward.</p>

  <p>'Path of heavens?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought, his eyes lighting up. He hurried to follow Mike.</p>

  <p>When he was young, he had followed his father like this. But at the time, he had been too small and hadn't been able to keep up with Mike's footsteps. Luo Zheng had stumbled and run, occasionally complaining in a low voice that Mike was walking too fast. But his father had never stopped to wait for him.</p>

  <p>He still remembered it clearly. Now that he was the same size as his father, he had a better understanding. In fact, ever since he had been a child, his father had already had some expectations for him. He, on the other hand, had never understood his father's strict character. Only now did he understand Mike's painstaking efforts.</p>

  <p>"Those are the rules that I have comprehended in my entire life," Mike said calmly.</p>

  <p>Looking at where Mike was pointing, Luo Zheng saw two screens on both sides of the path of heavens. Countless gold lights were circulating unceasingly on the screens. These lights had completely different shapes, and the Mu Ning they emitted was also completely different. 'These are the supreme rules my father has mastered?'</p>

  <p>"In the Evolutionary Universe, you all call it Heavenly Destiny," Mike added.</p>
