<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 174 Battle In The Sky Forest (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>But this time, the situation was different. They had come across a few demon generals and faced substantial loss. They were uncertain about the fate of the disciples from Blackrock Peak. Even though they knew that the likelihood of the disciples from Blackrock Peak surviving the counter was slim, none of the disciples from Lady Peak and Drizzle Peak were willing to believe it. Under such circumstances, they needed to cooperate.</p>

  <p>The circumstances did not improve after the disciples of Drizzle Peak and Lady Peak joined the battle, as these disciples were not involved in the fights with the demon generals.</p>

  <p>Since demon generals were exceptionally strong, a disciple's chances of winning rested on his concentration. An accidental interruption might break the current balance between Lenard and his opponent, the three disciples and their opponent. In such a case, the generals would be able to kill the disciples easily.</p>

  <p>With such concerns in mind, the disciples decided to help in the battle against the demon soldiers. Only one disciple rushed toward the demon general. That was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His target was the demon general who was pinned down by the three disciples of Skytop Peak. As per his estimate, these three disciples were the inner disciples at the fourth-grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>From what he could see, their strategy had been to form a triangular barrier and build an exceptionally effective offensive. Within this barrier, through their close cooperation, they were able to fend off the demon general's attacks. Judging from their current actions and movements, these disciples seemed to be under the same mentor.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful the demon general's attack, the three could find an appropriate angle to ward off its blows.</p>

  <p>In theory, if the three could cooperate closely together, they could be three times stronger than if they worked separately. And with such power, they could match the demon general's strength.</p>

  <p>However, there was a shortcoming in this strategy.</p>

  <p>Because the barrier required close cooperation, each of the three disciples had to be precise in their timing, control, and angle calculations. If any of the three made a little mistake, such as taking a wrong step, the barrier would have a leak. Once the demon general caught this leak and seized the opportunity to kill one of them, the balance would be broken, and the lives of the other two disciples would be at risk.</p>

  <p>After frequent and tense changes of positions and gestures, a loophole finally appeared.</p>

  <p>One of the disciples was very nervous under the pressure of the demon general, and so he took a wrong step and went too far away from the other two. By the time he realized his mistake and tried to move back, it was too late.</p>

  <p>The demon general had been frustrated by the three's barrier and soon seized this opportunity. With a roar, the demon general stretched its tawny palm and grabbed the inner disciple who moved a little far away.</p>

  <p>The disciple had known that there was something wrong with the barrier as it did not work any longer. When he saw the approaching sharp claws of the demon general, his face turned pale. He closed his eyes in despair.</p>

  <p>In his mind, there was no escaping certain death.</p>

  <p>Similar to his assumption, the bystanders felt their heart sink when they noticed that the balance of the three would be broken. Although they were struggling to fight against the demon soldiers, most disciples still paid their attention on the fight with the demon generals. They understood that the two demon generals were the key to the battle. Now, seeing that the demon general had infiltrated the triangular barrier of the three disciples, they felt nervous and worried.</p>

  <p>Once the demon general killed the three disciples, Lenard would be besieged by two demon generals. Even though Lenard was strong, there was a slim chance that he would be able to fend off the attacks of two demon generals. And if Lenard died as well, it would not be long before the two demon generals turned to the rest of the disciples..... Then, they would all die.</p>

  <p>Most disciples had thought of this scenario and were now considering alternatives. Some disciples contemplated escaping at this critical moment. Their logic was that even if one disciple survived, it would be better than all being killed by the demons.</p>

  <p>But just at that moment, a figure rushed toward the demon general.</p>

  <p>The man moved closer to the demon without any indication of slowing down. He kept running to the demon general at full speed! Most disciples recognized this man to be Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Normally, a human's body was soft, as it was mainly made of flesh and blood while a demon's body was as hard as steel.</p>

  <p>If a human used his body to collide with a demon, the result would be like an egg hitting a stone. What was he thinking? Did he want to risk certain death?</p>

  <p>Most disciples couldn't fathom why Luo Zheng would charge at a demon general.</p>

  <p>Only disciples such as Cleve and Henry from Drizzle Peak understood why Luo Zheng was sprinting toward the demon general. His body was abnormally hard.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Nina! Look at Luo Zheng! Does he want to die?" One of the female disciples from Lady Peak shouted in surprise.</p>

  <p>Nina had been watching Luo Zheng. Seeing his desperate run toward the demon general, she felt confused as to his intentions. She did not believe that Luo Zheng, who was a half-step into the nature level, could kill a demon general. But at this moment, Luo Zheng dared to sprint toward a demon general.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but be in awe of his courage!</p>

  <p>This young man was very promising. She hoped that he would survive.</p>

  <p>As Nina prayed for Zheng's well-being, the demon general, who had been focusing all his attention on the three disciples, turned in Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>A mocking expression grew on his face when he realized what was about to happen.</p>

  <p>The human heading his way was not even a nature creature! How could this human boy think he could charge at him like this? Did he want to die?</p>

  <p>At this moment, the demon general and the disciples all thought that Luo Zheng was looking for death.</p>

  <p>But when Zheng's small body finally hit the huge and hard body of the demon general, the unexpected result astonished everyone.</p>

  <p>"Bump!"</p>

  <p>A dull sound followed the collision.</p>

  <p>The demon general, who was as tall as three mature humans, flew back with the force of the impact. His body crashed through dozens of spruce trees before stopping.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng seemed unhurt. He stood up and patted the dust from his body as if nothing had happened...</p>
