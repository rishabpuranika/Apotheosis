<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2902 A Fierce Battle Before The Gate </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Holy Jay stood at the mountain peak, his eyes shifting as he looked around the vast expanse surrounding him.</p>

  <p>He could see every single detail. Even a tiny change taking place a thousand miles away didn't escape his attention.</p>

  <p>The silver light on the surface of the Mountain of Holy Beings intensified.</p>

  <p>It looked like silver being melted and poured on it from above.</p>

  <p>And then, from deep within the mountain, came the sure effects of vibrations taking hold.</p>

  <p>A huge gate, about a thousand feet tall, appeared at the foot of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the gate sent the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods into an excited tizzy.</p>

  <p>"The gate is open!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! I'd better be the first to enter!"</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>The moment people began scrambling towards the gate, a flame suddenly appeared before it.</p>

  <p>The flame bloomed and turned into a fiery snake a thousand feet high, floating in front of the gate.</p>

  <p>A Demi-holy Being rushed to the front, determined to get to the top this time. Since the fire snake had not yet filled the entire gate, he activated the Grand Teleportation and tried to rush in.</p>

  <p>But he was too late. He had barely reached the gate when the fire snake managed to block every last corner, showering him with its fire.</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Being didn't have the chance to struggle or scream before he was burned to ashes and scattered in the wind.</p>

  <p>"What kind of fire is this?"</p>

  <p>"Why did it stop us from entering the Mountain of Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>

  <p>The power contained in the fire was far beyond their imagination. Even Clark, who was the most proficient person of the Elementary Fire Godly Way, was unable to deal with the fire.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic. We'll let you in when the time is right. But don't you dare try and break through the gate. If you do, you will end up just like him. Don't blame me for not warning you,"</p>

  <p>Hamish sneered, standing before the door.</p>

  <p>All the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods floated in the air in a daze, at a loss what to do.</p>

  <p>"He is the Other Shore Realm warrior that stands behind the Han Clan," an insider whispered.</p>

  <p>"A master like him is much stronger than a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why he is blocking the gate. Is he going to stop us from becoming Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>Depression had caught hold of everyone, but they didn't dare say anything after learning of this person's cultivation base. They could only obey him and refrain from doing anything.</p>

  <p>A thousand miles away, Holy Jay frowned as he saw this.</p>

  <p>Even though they had predicted that enemies would stop Zheng from entering the gate, it was indeed troublesome that a Yellow Emperor Guard was standing firmly at the entrance of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a sudden ripple of movements appeared at the northern end of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>A loud noise like a bang sounded as the surface of the sea beside the north shore descended, as if a gigantic beast had opened its mouth to swallow the sea water.</p>

  <p>When the sea level had reached a certain level, it stopped and began to rise rapidly again.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The colorful sea water poured out of the Time Sea, turning into a tsunami that was a hundred thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods were not ignorant, but they were still stunned at what they saw.</p>

  <p>Only Holy Beings could deal with the sea water of the Time Sea. Even if a Demi-holy Being were to as much as touch it, they would die in an instant.</p>

  <p>"What is behind the tsunami?"</p>

  <p>"It is the Emperor Resentment! The monster in the Time Sea— the Emperor Resentment!"</p>

  <p>"Run! Our bodies will be torn to shreds if the water of the Time Sea touches us!"</p>

  <p>These people were even more depressed.</p>

  <p>The few months of wait had everyone itching to rush into the Mountain of Holy Beings. But now, a strong man at the Other Shore Realm was blocking their way. And then this huge tsunami was emerging from the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>What was happening!?</p>

  <p>But since the tsunami was no more than a hundred thousand feet high, they had the chance to escape since they could easily move higher than that using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Everyone moved away from the approaching tsunami using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Hamish stood before the huge gate, his expression unchanging as he watched the tsunami coming towards him.</p>

  <p>The water of the Time Sea couldn't tear a Holy Being apart, let alone him.</p>

  <p>Hamish was surprised to see a man standing on the Emperor Resentment, who was an Other Shore Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect a member of the Nine Li race to have been hiding in Time Sea! Zavier, it's time for you to fight!" Hamish was a bit surprised.</p>

  <p>He had barely finished talking when the sea water of the Time Sea submerged him, along with a small part of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>But the water couldn't tear Hamish apart, nor could it affect the silver light on the mountain's surface.</p>

  <p>Space fluctuated as Zavier's brazen laughter reverberated through it. "I wonder who the nameless Nine Li rat is! Fight me!"</p>

  <p>Saying thus, Zavier turned into an arrow and shot towards the Emperor Resentment.</p>

  <p>"Wooo!"</p>

  <p>The Emperor Resentment let out a low growl. It lifted its tentacles and tried to grab Zavier.</p>

  <p>Leif stood on the Emperor Resentment's head, a bronze dagger-axe in his hand. He had been in hiding for so many years that Lorena's call had filled him with daring. He had no intention of returning alive.</p>

  <p>Zavier was incredibly fast. Although the Emperor Resentment's tentacles were flexible, they couldn't wrap themselves around him.</p>

  <p>He was standing before Leif in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The bronze dagger-axe in Leif's hand began to boil.</p>

  <p>He had been hiding in seclusion in the Time Sea for so many years that his strength had grown immensely during this time.</p>

  <p>He made good use of this strength as he headed for Zavier, brandishing the bronze dagger-axe.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Resentment, on the other hand, tried its best to attack Hamish and drive him away from the gate.</p>

  <p>Although Hamish was the weakest of the Yellow Emperor Guards, his strength could not be ignored.</p>

  <p>"You fucking beast! You are courting death!"</p>

  <p>With a push of Hamish's hands, circles of blazing fire rings spread out around him.</p>

  <p>Sizz...</p>

  <p>The Emperor Resentment's skin was rough and thick, but the fire rings managed to scorch its tentacles.</p>

  <p>"Woo... Woo..."</p>

  <p>The Emperor Resentment let out a groan of pain and opened its big mouth, revealing its sharp teeth.</p>

  <p>The beast roared and shot a thick, large poisonous blood arrow from its mouth towards Hamish. The arrow covered the entire gate, and if Hamish wanted to avoid it, he would have to leave his post at the gate.</p>

  <p>Hamish, however, didn't budge. The poison blood arrow was only ten feet away when Salim's figure appeared beside him. "Defense!" Salim said.</p>

  <p>An oval-shaped ball of light shrouded Hamish and Salim. This was the theurgy that came from the Truth of Holy Words, which Salim was proficient in.</p>

  <p>The light ball easily blocked the poison blood arrow.</p>

  <p>A thousand miles away, the tsunami caused by the Emperor Resentment had destroyed many villages along the way, including a small divine city.</p>

  <p>Except for a few top-rank True Gods, the others were all torn to pieces, falling into the cracks of time.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay and Estelle floated in the air. He looked very worried.</p>

  <p>Hamish was guarding the gate at all times, making it difficult for Holy Jay to find a way to send Zheng in.</p>
