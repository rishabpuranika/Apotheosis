<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the three men entered the hall, the man on left chuckled as he said,</p>

  <p>"These women are warriors that have just ascended to our Pure Jade Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>"The female warriors at the Soul Sea Realm from the Lower World are all beauties, aren't they?" the man on the right remarked with a smirk.</p>

  <p>The most handsome one stood in the middle, attracting every woman's gaze the moment he stepped into the hall. "Those that can ascend to the Upper World must be the most talented warriors in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>From a young age, they've used pills to change their facial features and body shape, perpetuating their youth. That's why they're all beauties," he explained plainly.</p>

  <p>Having waited there for quite a while, the women at the Soul Sea Realm found themselves eager to approach the three men that just arrived and ask about their status.</p>

  <p>The lady in the lead asked, "Sirs, I wonder what the Pure Jade Sacred Place intends to do by putting us all in here?"</p>

  <p>One of the men chuckled and said, "Don't worry. We have no ill intentions. It's just that it's rather difficult for women to ascend to the Upper World, so we decide to save you the trouble of mining."</p>

  <p>Although all the warriors from the Lower World in the hall were women, they had all gone through so much before ascending to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they weren't impressed by the man's words.</p>

  <p>In truth, they all knew that he was making it sound much simpler than it was actually going to be.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, why do we need to be locked in here? Why not just let us go?" another woman asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Standing in the corner was Yudie, who furrowed her brows when she heard the woman's question. If they were freed, she'd be able to go and find Zheng. But with the way things were looking, it seemed the men weren't just going to let them go too easily.</p>

  <p>As expected, the man only laughed. "The Pure Jade Sacred Place is the greatest power of the Three Purities World. Since you've ascended here, could it be that you all want to give up the rare opportunity to join our sacred place?"</p>

  <p>Worry filled the hearts of the women in the hall.</p>

  <p>Because they knew they were no match for the three men, they could only wait and see what they were really after.</p>

  <p>"Master Hai of our Pure Jade Sacred Place is almost a world lord. He wants to take in some disciples. You are all fortunate enough to be chosen for the status. Follow me. It's worth noting, however, that Master Hai has his own standards. Not just anyone can become his disciple.</p>

  <p>Good luck, girls."</p>

  <p>"Master Hai's disciples?"</p>

  <p>"I've had no master since I started cultivating. No matter what cultivation level Master Hai is at, I refuse to be his disciple."</p>

  <p>"I knew being brought here was bad news. There are so many women at the Soul Sea Realm in the Upper World. Why must Master Hai take us as his disciples?"</p>

  <p>These women were all clever enough to understand what was going on— it was rather upsetting.</p>

  <p>But why would the three men at the Spirit Supreme Realm bother listening to what they had to say?</p>

  <p>At his command, a squadron of soldiers rushed in from outside the hall.</p>

  <p>They pulled out several gray bracelets and forced them on the women's wrists— they were Life Vitality Sealing Bracelets.</p>

  <p>Those who wore such bracelets were rendered unable to use their life vitality.</p>

  <p>While some of the women were keen on resisting, they knew that they couldn't possibly take on the three warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm and the soldiers at the Soul Sea Realm. The women were only at the early stage of Soul Sea Realm, after all.</p>

  <p>Yudie didn't bother resisting, but she gave the ring on her finger a few strokes— she had given her own space ring to Zheng and later had a weapon refiner at the Cloud Hall to forge her another one.</p>

  <p>In her heart, she silently prayed for Zheng's protection.</p>

  <p>But because he was still stuck in the Illusion Battlefield, he had no clue that Yudie had already ascended.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng, Aurora, Amber, and the rest were still climbing up the Sacred Ailanthus.</p>

  <p>The tree had a total of thirteen branches, each branch home to some kind of strange bug.</p>

  <p>On the eighth branch, Explosive Ferocious Ants lay.</p>

  <p>On the ninth branch, there were Human-faced Cicadas— the faces were so lifelike, and the fact that they could actually speak like humans made them all the more terrifying.</p>

  <p>Then, on the tenth branch, Poison Ice Toads.</p>

  <p>On the eleventh, Vigorous Elephant-nose Bugs.</p>

  <p>Amber, Aurora, and the other Demon Night warriors had made quite the record passing the twelfth branch.</p>

  <p>But every time they made it to the twelfth branch, many of them got killed.</p>

  <p>This time, with Zheng's help, not only did they speed up dramatically, but also not a single warrior died.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng became a mighty warrior in the eyes of this group of Demon Night warriors.</p>

  <p>The Poison Ice Toads were highly toxic creatures— none of the warriors had ever seen such creatures in the outside world.</p>

  <p>Even if it was Amber or Aurora who was bitten by them, they would still fall victim to the venom.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had charged straight through these creatures like they were nothing— he didn't show even a hint of reaction to the danger.</p>

  <p>The Vigorous Elephant-nose Bugs had a strength that shouldn't have been ignored— it was far beyond what an ordinary warrior could handle.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's brute force was a level higher, able to suppress the bugs easily.</p>

  <p>After a moment, they finally stood atop the twelfth branch of the Sacred Ailanthus.</p>

  <p>At the end of the branch were forty round red fruits.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me that these fruits are full of Illusion Points?" A strange expression appeared on Zheng's face as he examined the cluster of fruits.</p>

  <p>With a nod, Aurora said, "Each one contains 100, 000 Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>"So many!"</p>

  <p>The news was shocking to even Zheng.</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole thing, he believed that it was a shortcut to plunder someone else's Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Most of the participants in the Illusion Battlefield also thought the same way, so the battles were mostly concentrated around the cities.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, the arrangements of the Illusion Battlefield were far richer than he initially imagined.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder Aurora and Amber had to keep re-entering the Deadwood Gate.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's strength, he could easily climb up the Sacred Ailanthus all by himself. If he could obtain those fruits by himself, he could probably gather four million Illusion Points in one trip. According to Aurora, the Deadwood Gate had opened up three times. If he entered it all by himself three times, wouldn't that have made twelve million Illusion Points?</p>

  <p>It was no wonder he could only rank a bit below the 10, 000th place of the Illusion Battlefield after killing Lucille and having accumulated almost five million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>"Everyone here can get one of these fruits." When Aurora walked over, she picked out one, signaling that it was time to sit more comfortably.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Demon Night warriors lit up. A single fruit meant 100, 000 Illusion Points, after all.</p>

  <p>Since the other warriors were following behind Zheng, they didn't really have to deal with the bugs themselves. The fact they could gain 100, 000 Illusion Points was already more than enough.</p>

  <p>"As for the rest of the Illusion Points, 30% for me and 70% for you.</p>

  <p>What do you think, Zheng?" With a smile, Aurora fixed her blue eyes on him.</p>

  <p>"Sure," Zheng nodded. "What about Amber? Why doesn't she need it?"</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking, Amber shook her head, "I don't need it."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Zheng prodded.</p>

  <p>In place of Amber, Aurora went ahead and answered the question. "If Amber accumulates a certain amount of Illusion Points, she'll definitely make it to the front. With so many Demon Night warriors keeping an eye on the list, she'll definitely be noticed by the others. The current Amber doesn't need to be noticed— it's better for her to blend in and be forgotten."</p>

  <p>Amber's body was still in the Demon Night prison, after all, and the top five million warriors in the entire Illusion Battlefield would attract unnecessary attention. With her strength, it wouldn't be difficult for her to enter the top five million.</p>

  <p>If Yao noticed this by chance, Amber would face even more severe consequences.</p>

  <p>Although it wasn't a probable outcome, it wasn't worth the risk.</p>

  <p>Looking deeply into Amber's eyes, Zheng nodded. "I got it."</p>

  <p>Then, he took the fruits from Aurora and crushed them one by one.</p>

  <p>Every time he crushed a fruit, the Illusion Points burst out of it before rapidly fleeing into his body.</p>

  <p>After crushing 21 fruits, Zheng obtained 2, 100, 000 Illusion Points— such a number was beyond anyone's expectation. It was only a little less than the points he gained from killing Lucille.</p>

  <p>But when he checked his ranking, it turned out that he barely moved.</p>

  <p>In this supreme world, his ranking had already moved up to the 267th.</p>

  <p>But in the entire Illusion Battlefield, his ranking didn't only fail to improve, but also dropped to the 15, 000th. This meant that the warriors ahead of him were plundering Illusion Points much faster than him.</p>
