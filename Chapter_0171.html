<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 171 The Demon-revealing Needle (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With the help of the light from the bonfire, Zheng was able to study his surroundings. He saw about ten female disciples standing on a wide branch of a spruce tree.</p>

  <p>The female disciple in the front gripped a long sword horizontally and looked nervous. She shouted at Zheng, "Don't move forward. Which peak are you from?"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his head and answered, "We are disciples from Drizzle Peak!"</p>

  <p>Of the thirty-three peaks at Cloud Sect, only Lady Peak housed female disciples. Since only female disciples were standing on the branch, it could be assumed that they were from Lady Peak.</p>

  <p>After Yan came to Lady Peak, the strength of the entire peak was enhanced. Although Yan was imprisoned now, the peak retained its average strength.</p>

  <p>It was undoubtedly more powerful than Drizzle Peak, which was ranked at the bottom.</p>

  <p>Since Lady Peak was the only peak among the thirty-three peaks at Cloud Sect to accommodate female refiners, it was the most popular peak among the male disciples. It was also the best place for male disciples to find companions.</p>

  <p>The female disciple standing on the tree was named Nina. She was from the Zhu Clan, which was famous for their powerful weapon needles.</p>

  <p>Given her strength and cultivation level, she was an inner disciple at Lady Peak. Her strength and rank ensured that she was selected to lead her group during this trial to chop the demon.</p>

  <p>"The Drizzle Peak? Stand there!" Nina Zhu warned again. Then she aimed a small jade box at Zheng and the others from Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Although Nina Zhu was surprised that the Pear Needle Rainstorm was not effective on Zheng, as the descendant of the Zhu Clan, she had more powerful weapons at her disposal. Thus she felt secure that she could confront him.</p>

  <p>For example, the small jade box in her hand was named Shock Dragon.</p>

  <p>It looked ordinary, but Nina knew that if the Shock Dragon were released, its power would be equivalent to a full blow from an overmatch at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Zheng felt the power hidden in the small jade box, which was why he was obedient.</p>

  <p>Then Nina passed the jade box to another female disciple from Lady Peak before jumping down from the tall tree.</p>

  <p>When she jumped from the branch, her black hair scattered. Fortunately, she had a soft, lissome figure. She landed agilely on the ground of the forest. Nina then ran her fingers through her hair as she cautiously approached Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once she got close, Zheng could see her appearance clearly. She had fair skin, bright eyes and white teeth. She was short and slender but well-rounded. Under the light of the bonfire, she looked indistinct.</p>

  <p>"Don't move!" Nina lifted her beautiful brows and warned, "My sister disciple is more timorous than me. If you move even a little bit, you'll frighten her and then she will release the Shock Dragon. Then, all of you will die!"</p>

  <p>All disciples from Drizzle Peak heard the words 'Shock Dragon', and the expression changed on the faces. They had been at Cloud Sect longer than Zheng, and hence, they were more familiar with the top seven noble clans. So, they had naturally heard of weapons such as the Shock Dragon. It was known that the Shock Dragon could kill all nature creatures in one second. There was no chance of survival even for creatures at grade 9 or 10 of the nature level once hit by the Shock Dragon.</p>

  <p>"Since you carry the Shock Dragon, you must be from Zhu Clan, right?"</p>

  <p>Cleve asked.</p>

  <p>Nina's expression hardened when she heard Cleve's question. "Nobody told you to speak. Don't say anything!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Nina's expression, Zheng laughed in a low voice. Nina's expression hardened some more. With a cold tone, she said, "I didn't tell you to laugh. You can't laugh, either!"</p>

  <p>So Zheng hurried to restrain his laughter. He stared at Nina with an innocent expression.</p>

  <p>Zheng's comical expression released the tension. As Nina laughed out, she waved her beautiful hand. Suddenly, a jade needle appeared between her fingers.</p>

  <p>She grasped the jade needle tightly and waved it in front of Zheng. Then she carefully checked the needle's color. Afterward, she walked to Cleve and repeated the action. She waved the jade needle in front of each of the eight disciples from Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>At last, Nina sighed with relief and looked relaxed. She announced, "All right. Now I am sure there is no demon soldier mixed with you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was curious and asked, "You can check that with your jade needle?"</p>

  <p>Nina smiled, "This is the Demon-revealing Needle of the Zhu Clan. It is sensitive to evil spirit. As you know, a demon can eat a person and then disguise himself to look like that person. Despite a demon's ability to camouflage himself as his victim, he will spread a little evil spirit. When this Demon-revealing Needle touches an evil spirit, it will change from green to red."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. As expected, each of the seven noble clans had a unique strength. Zhu Clan was an expert in hidden weapons and all kinds of techniques to make such neat stuff.</p>

  <p>"Sisters, you can come down. There is no demon among them," Nina turned to her group and announced.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the female disciples from Lady Peak hidden on the tree jumped down and settled around the bonfire.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, the disciples from Drizzle Peak also sat on the ground around the bonfire. Zheng asked, "You are so cautious. Have you also been attacked by demons before?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng asked this question, the expression on all female disciples of Lady Peak saddened. Seeing this, Zheng felt as though no words were needed to answer his question.</p>

  <p>Nina nodded with tears in her eyes, "We thought it was not dangerous to take the trial to chop the demons this year as some senior brother disciples had vowed to protect us. Who would know that..."</p>
