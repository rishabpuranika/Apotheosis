<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had the physique and soul of a powerful warrior but his theurgy was still limited to the Divine Dao of the chaos.</p>

  <p>He had never mastered the power of the main world and the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>He had no idea what kind of theurgy the Heavenly Ring Staff possessed.</p>

  <p>He was shocked to see everyone around him get knocked to the floor by the strong force it was emanating.</p>

  <p>"Stop! Let the members of the Elemental race go!" Geoffrey sputtered.</p>

  <p>At this, the Heavenly Ring Staff trembled slightly. The members of the Elemental race who had been brought to the floor felt the pressure ease off them. They quickly scrambled to get back up.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were back on their feet, they swarmed around Geoffrey and Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>They knelt in front of them and bowed again and again in reverence.</p>

  <p>They considered Elder Xue as a sage and a god to be venerated. It was a kind of blasphemy for the golden-haired Cold Apes to have held him hostage! But Geoffrey defeated those heretics, so he must be a stronger sage and a more powerful god than Elder Xue himself!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey shifted uncomfortably watching the people kowtow to him.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, please tell them not to bow and scrape like that. It makes me feel so bad."</p>

  <p>Elder Xue smiled helplessly. "I can't. The Elemental race is still a primitive race. Faith is quite important to them. I can help them keep the faith, but snapping them out of it is another matter entirely."</p>

  <p>Elder Xue then turned and said something to the Elemental race. As one, they got up and began charging at the outsiders.</p>

  <p>The members of the Elemental race showed no mercy to those who had attacked Elder Xue. They slaughtered them all. The area was left awash in blood.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, in an exquisite wooden hall, Geoffrey began to discuss returning back home with Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey actually knew the way back, but he had come here to send the little monster home and try to bring Elder Xue back.</p>

  <p>However, Elder Xue only shook his head at his proposition. "I'm afraid that's not possible."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Geoffrey asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue looked surprised. "Don't you know? After the catastrophe with the Four Spirits Sect, no one from the main world could return. If they do, they will die."</p>

  <p>This was also the case in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>In the decisive battle between the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race, some members had managed to escape. It was unknown whether they were still alive, but rules had been imposed then that they would never be able to return.</p>

  <p>That was why when Kincaid in the chaos heard that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had seen Elder Xue, he had correctly estimated that Elder Xue was still living in the Deep Space. He couldn't have broken the restriction. It would have been impossible for him to cross the main world and then go straight to the chaos.</p>

  <p>"So I'm really going back alone?" a disappointed Geoffrey said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The top priority is to bring back the Heavenly Ring Staff. The sooner, the better," Elder Xue said firmly.</p>

  <p>"But those races in the Deep Space will definitely seek revenge on you.</p>

  <p>You might be in danger, Elder Xue," Geoffrey pleaded.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue smiled. "You have the Heavenly Ring Staff. It's strong enough to control the life and death of all the inhabitants in the Deep Space. They couldn't take revenge on me if they try."</p>

  <p>He knew Elder Xue was probably right, but Geoffrey still couldn't help but feel uneasy. He turned to speak to the Heavenly Ring Staff, "I need some guards to protect him."</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff extracted Geoffrey's power again.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The ground trembled and splintered. Over a thousand human-shaped statues crawled out.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey nodded in approval at these guards created by the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>Witnessing what looked like a miracle to them, the members of the Elemental race began to fall all over themselves to praise Geoffrey again.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Geoffrey had to bid goodbye and start his journey back.</p>

  <p>He left the broken ground and returned to the Sky Wheel City. From the center of the city, he went northward to the most remote point. He passed the passageway and made his way back to the secret circular room he had come from before.</p>

  <p>He activated the transmission array here. The beams of light started shooting into his body, engulfing him bit by bit from head to foot.</p>

  <p>His body began to disappear in parts until it completely vanished from the spot.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, Geoffrey found himself in the diamond-shaped array above the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>He gathered his bearings momentarily, looked around, and then jumped down.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It had taken Geoffrey several months to climb up the pillar, but now that he could fly with the help of the Heavenly Ring Staff, his descent was much quicker.</p>

  <p>He had left Ziya at the foot of the pillar, so he went to meet him first.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey was a hundred feet high above the ground, he turned and flew toward the nearest secondary world.</p>

  <p>At that moment in the secondary world, Ziya was hard at work piecing together a statue.</p>

  <p>It had been such a long time since Geoffrey had left, and he had yet to hear from him. He couldn't help but fear he had met a terrible fate.</p>

  <p>But Ziya never gave up easily.</p>

  <p>He had once been exiled into the Deleting Space, but even then, he had remained steadfast. In the end, he had not only successfully controlled the Deleting Space, but had also drilled a hole right through the chaos.</p>

  <p>He refused to leave the secondary world without Geoffrey. After all, without him, he wouldn't have even been able to climb up the pillar, let alone go back to the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>He focused his attention on the statue he was working on. The statue made by the Four Spirits Sect could freely walk around the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He thought if he could control it, perhaps he could leave bit by bit.</p>

  <p>However, he soon found that the way the Four Spirits Sect created the statue was quite complex. It took Ziya a long time to repair even a small broken part of it. It occurred to him it would probably take him dozens of years to finish repairing it.</p>

  <p>But if he had been able to survive many chaotic eras in the Deleting Space, a few decades here were nothing.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sound broke into Ziya's reveries.</p>

  <p>He snapped his head up and saw a figure flying in. It was Geoffrey carrying a wooden staff!</p>

  <p>Ziya let out a series of expletives and burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>He had lived for over a thousand chaotic eras, but he was still as exuberant as before.</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting," Geoffrey greeted with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What took you so long? I was beginning to think you had died! Were you able to reach the top of the pillar?" Ziya asked.</p>

  <p>He had been isolated here for some time and so knew nothing about what happened in the chaos.</p>

  <p>"I did, but..." Geoffrey began.</p>

  <p>"Did you find anything there?" Ziya pressed on eagerly. He knew how valuable the Other Shore Tokens at the top of the pillar were.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have, but..." Geoffrey said slowly.</p>

  <p>"But what?" Ziya asked.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey let out a deep breath. "It's not what you might expect. A lot of things have happened."</p>
