  <p>
</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow had been defeated by a world lord twice now? this was something that had never happened before ever since ancient times!</p>

  <p>It was understandable when he was defeated the first time as he didn't have an idea of Luo Zheng's strength at all. After all, there were always some world lords in the universes that possessed abilities that even a Supreme Lord couldn't match. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng was a Godly Genius and that was a big deal.</p>

  <p>The second time he got defeated was because Supreme Lord Shadow had underestimated Luo Zheng's strength again.</p>

  <p>Even though he had made the wrong judgment twice, Supreme Lord Shadow couldn't forgive himself. Now that he faced Luo Luo Zheng, he viewed him as an opponent of the same level as himself?</p>

  <p>Right after Supreme Lord Shadow finished his evaluation, Luo Luo Zheng had suddenly disappeared to his surprise!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Soon after, he heard a whistling sound. Luo Luo Zheng had actually used Grand Teleportation and appeared above him. Using the Great Weighty Sword in his hand he began slaying!</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike! Wind Kill!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been preparing for this attack for a long time.</p>

  <p>This Supreme Lord Shadow was an established Supreme Lord within the Demon Night. After being unsuccessful twice in a row, he had to do something in order to save some face.</p>

  <p>It was indeed an honor for a normal world lord to get such a comment, but Luo Luo Zheng had no interest in hearing it.</p>

  <p>On the eastern side of the Evolutionary Universe, the Godly Genius Maha had made his move within the Sunflower Water World. The Supreme Lords from both the Sacred race and human race had already begun their arrangements. A decisive battle could erupt at any time, and Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't stay here for too long!</p>

  <p>He only wanted results; he wasn't interested in getting anyone's appreciation or praise.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when he attacked suddenly, he used the most effective method!</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng's cultivation had reached a whole new level. Combined with the burst of chaotic energy, the Gods-intimidating Strike released a power that was at a whole new level!</p>

  <p>A sword shadow spread out. It was like wind blades that contained the tenth layer of Wind Law were crushing down from all directions. These beams of sword radiance cut through the air, blocking all paths of Supreme Lord Shadow to retreat!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't have timed the attack any better!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord Shadow was stunned!</p>

  <p>In a battle of this level, success or failure was usually decided in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow was extremely quick to react and he was adept at escaping.</p>

  <p>Faced with Luo Zheng's powerful sword attack, he abruptly lowered his body and transformed into two black shadows. The two black shadows instantly multiplied into four, and then into eight, sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four?</p>

  <p>Puff puff puff ?</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's strike had destroyed some of the shadows, the number of the shadows below was increasing at a terrifying speed!</p>

  <p>A thousand black shadows?</p>

  <p>Two thousand black shadows?</p>

  <p>Four thousand black shadows?</p>

  <p>Every time these black shadows multiplied, their numbers would double?</p>

  <p>Ten thousand?</p>

  <p>Twenty thousand?</p>

  <p>Forty Thousand?.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the area around the Inauguration Altar was surrounded by countless black shadows, all of them created by Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>Leroy and Supreme Lord Korbin, who were fighting high up in the sky at that moment, paused as they were intrigued by Luo Luo Zheng. Supreme Lord Korbin noted with interest. "That kid is not bad! He actually forced Supreme Lord Shadow to reveal his trump card!"</p>

  <p>In Supreme Lord Korbin's view, even if Supreme Lord Shadow was unlucky and got defeated by Luo Luo Zheng twice, he shouldn't have taken it too seriously...</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, Luo Luo Zheng had dealt a huge blow to Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>When he saw the army of black shadows, Luo Zheng's expression darkened. His sword attack had failed to end the battle. Instead, it had provoked a powerful counterattack from Supreme Lord Shadow. He could only choose to avoid the attack temporarily.</p>

  <p>A bright light flashed under Luo Zheng's feet, and just as he was about to use the Grand Teleportation to make his escape, all the hands of the black shadows suddenly moved. Their left arms held their right hands, while their right hands pointed towards the sky!</p>

  <p>These black shadows were Supreme Lord Shadow's clones. Their movements were synchronized, as if they were practicing martial arts!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly a black circle appeared under Luo Zheng's feet, and before he could teleport, it bound him tightly to the spot.</p>

  <p>"Damn..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat. The power in his feet erupted. He was about to break free from the black circle.</p>

  <p>When he let the power loose, no Supreme Lord would be able to contend against him. It was true that in the battle between Supreme Lords, or powerful masters at higher levels, strength could work wonders. But in many cases, it might not have any effect.</p>

  <p>The many methods employed in this sort of a high-stakes war usually involved the Law of Causality so it was impossible to win it just by relying on pure strength!</p>

  <p>The black circle looked like a thin film and was only two fingers wide, but it was extremely flexible as it bound Luo Luo Zheng. The strength that Luo Luo Zheng had released was enough to topple mountains and overturn the seas, but at this moment, he was unable to break free from the wretched black circle!</p>

  <p>"Shadows Kill!"</p>

  <p>With this command, the hands of the countless black shadows turned and connected with each other like an enormous black cloud which covered the sky and blocked out the sun!</p>

  <p>The world in front of Luo Zheng's eyes immediately turned dark.</p>

  <p>He was completely enveloped by the darkness, and not a trace of light could be seen. He couldn't even see his own hand in front of his face!</p>

  <p>The black shadows raced menacingly towards Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was able to tell the direction and distance of the black shadows through the will of the worlds, but he was unable to break free from the black circle beneath his feet!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The first black shadow charged towards Luo Luo Zheng, and then a sharp sound was heard!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could feel something ice-cold on his skin. Obviously, a sharp weapon had slashed him!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Soon after, there was a wave of sounds and sensations produced by the sharp weapons.</p>

  <p>The cultivation method practiced by Supreme Lord Shadow was unique.</p>

  <p>This Shadows Kill had equipped the shadows with his most powerful killing technique, and at the same time, he had locked Luo Luo Zheng by taking advantage of the Law of Causality of his Heavenly Destiny, making it impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to break free purely by relying on strength. Luo Luo Zheng was like a sitting duck, so Supreme Lord Shadow had enough time to shatter Luo Luo Zheng into pieces with ease!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The awful cutting sounds went on for several minutes.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, over a hundred thousand black shadows had attacked Luo Luo Zheng, which meant that he had been slashed over a hundred thousand times!</p>

  <p>Each time a black shadow finished its attack, it had completed its mission and so it vanished into the air?</p>

  <p>The black cloud, which had wiped out the sunlight and devoured the sky, became smaller and smaller as the black shadows faded away...</p>

  <p>When all the black shadows had dissipated, Luo Zheng's figure slowly appeared?</p>

  <p>Leroy looked pale while Supreme Lord Korbin and Supreme Lord Shadow, who was hidden in a black shadow, were extremely excited. To kill such an important Godly Genius with their own hands was such a thrill for them. Some Supreme Lords had very long lifespans, so it was hard to find anything to excite them.</p>

  <p>But when they saw Luo Zheng's condition clearly, the expressions of the three Supreme Lords changed once again!</p>

  <p>Leroy's wrinkled face revealed a smile once more. As for Supreme Lord Korbin and Supreme Lord Shadow, they were both shocked! Each time they thought they were coming close to a victory, they were proved wrong!</p>

  <p>"How, how is this possible?" one of them stuttered in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The one hundred thousand black shadows had already dissipated, leaving behind only a hazy black shadow. It began to slowly transform into the true form of Supreme Lord Shadow. He stood one hundred feet away from Luo Luo Zheng, gaping at him. The shock was painted all over his face.</p>

  <p>This kid was still alive!</p>

  <p>He never expected him to be able to survive his deadly Shadows Kill.</p>

  <p>"You, you're not hurt?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow's mind had become fuddled now. He found it hard to believe the phenomenon in front of him. Luo Luo Zheng was completely unharmed from head to toe. He couldn't see any wounds on Luo Zheng's body?</p>

  <p>The smile on Leroy's face grew wider. Even his shoulders began to shake as he chortled. "Hahahaha! This brat is a monster! He really is a monster!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy was naturally happy to see that Luo Luo Zheng was safe and sound, but Supreme Lord Korbin and Supreme Lord Shadow were feeling rather helpless.</p>

  <p>Humans had a natural fear towards things that were beyond common sense, and even the Supreme Lords were no exception. Indeed, the Shadows Kill was not the strongest among all the methods utilized by Supreme Lords. After all, the power of these one hundred thousand black shadows could not concentrate only on one point.</p>

  <p>Even if a Supreme Lord were to take it forcefully, they would likely to be on the point of dying. It was truly illogical for Luo Luo Zheng to not only be able to survive this attack but also do it without suffering any injuries!</p>

  <p>Even Supreme Lord Shadow wanted to retreat at this point!</p>

  <p>However, he was still unwilling to accept defeat. If he lost to a kid like Luo Luo Zheng, this would probably become an inner demon, which he would never be able to get rid of for the rest of his life. He would not accept this failure.</p>

  <p>Keeping this in mind, he gritted his teeth and went all out! Folding his hands together, he spat out a mouthful of blood essence. As the ball of blood essence danced on his hands, it condensed into a thumb-sized sword of blood essence.</p>
