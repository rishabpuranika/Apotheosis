<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back in the Phoenix Palace when Zheng fought Chance who was at the Chaotic Source Realm, Zheng had only used these sculptures to defeat him.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, these sculptures could also defeat the Evil God if they grew to become extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>But most people who were present didn't know about this. They were puzzled.</p>

  <p>With one gentle stroke of Zheng's hand over the Regal Jade chessboard, the second Regal Jade sculpture also descended, followed by the third, the fourth, and the fifth.</p>

  <p>The force of every Regal Jade sculpture had increased by a hundred or so divine megatons compared to the previous one, its size and toughness also multiplying astronomically.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Zheng had more than a dozen Regal Jade sculptures around him.</p>

  <p>The increase in the power of the Regal Jade sculptures followed a regular pattern. The fourteenth jade statue already had a force of a thousand divine megatons, which was equivalent to the strength of the weakest Chaotic Source Realm warriors. But this statue wouldn't suffice to fight against a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, and it was even no match for warriors like Dorothy or Elvinia.</p>

  <p>The whirlpool in the sky finally disappeared only after Zheng had summoned twenty Regal Jade sculptures.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's body was pitch black from head to toe, as if made of black steel.</p>

  <p>His body emanated a strong aura, and his height had more than doubled. A row of black spikes extended from his shoulders, like the fangs of a monster.</p>

  <p>"This is the first time I've used the Inheritance of World. You should feel honored," the Evil God said as he looked down at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What is the Inheritance of World?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. All I know is that the Other Shore Tokens that can summon a world to descend are all terrifying!"</p>

  <p>"With the Evil God's current strength, he could kill many powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm in an instant."</p>

  <p>Many warriors from various races gulped in terror as they watched the Evil God transform.</p>

  <p>They had had great hope of reaching the Chaotic Source Realm. But the Evil God had enough strength to defeat all the Chaotic Source Realm warriors at once. They had never felt so discouraged.</p>

  <p>Zheng held up the Regal Jade chessboard in one hand, his other hand hovering over the chess pieces.</p>

  <p>He gave a gentle push and all the Regal Jade sculptures came to life.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, they made for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The twenty Regal Jade sculptures pounced on the Evil God in unison.</p>

  <p>The Evil God sneered disdainfully at the Regal Jade sculptures. He walked through the air, reaching out a hand and gently touched the sculptures that came at him.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>At the contact, the Regal Jade sculptures shattered into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>The emerald green fragments fell to the ground like rain.</p>

  <p>"Disappointing! They are too weak," the Evil God muttered, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>He continued to make his way through the air. It was as if he was walking down an invisible staircase.</p>

  <p>He was in no hurry and was actually enjoying the moment.</p>

  <p>He could feel the fear, panic, and unease of the people below.</p>

  <p>He wasn't strong enough now, but sooner or later, he would push all creatures in the chaos into a sense of unease.</p>

  <p>They would then have no choice but to kneel down before him and surrender to him.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained stoic. He once again placed his hand on the chess pieces and pushed gently at them. A second batch of Regal Jade sculptures rushed towards the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The second batch had ten Regal Jade sculptures.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had fought Chance, it had taken Zheng eighteen Regal Jade sculptures to defeat him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The second batch of Regal Jade sculptures were already over ten feet tall, their bodies extremely strong. Even Chance, who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm, had been unable to destroy them.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked on, his face a mask of calm, as he faced the second batch of Regal Jade sculptures.</p>

  <p>He leapt into the air and began to circle around the sculptures, causing them to shatter as well. No one had seen how he had done it.</p>

  <p>"Too weak, too weak!" the Evil God said impatiently. He then landed on the invisible staircase and strolled towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face hardened.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God had used the Inheritance of World, he became extremely powerful, as if he had achieved a complete transformation.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained calm and placed his fingers on the Regal Jade chessboard again. The third batch of sculptures came to life and charged at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>This batch of sculptures each had a force ranging from two to three thousand divine megatons, surpassing that of many warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm. The strength of these bodies was not as strong as that of the warriors who had merged with Chaotic Source Spirits, but one couldn't call them weak.</p>

  <p>The third batch of Regal Jade sculptures were still vulnerable before the Evil God. They had barely reached the Evil God before he crushed them like dry weeds.</p>

  <p>As they witnessed this, the warriors from the various races below trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>The descending type of Other Shore Tokens, which had a force of thousands of divine megatons, couldn't withstand even a single blow from this guy!</p>

  <p>Even though these members from various races were outstanding warriors of their races, it was not easy for them to deal with any of the Regal Jade sculptures. These sculptures didn't have any special ability, but the toughness of their bodies alone was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>"Zheng..."</p>

  <p>The worry on Yan's face intensified.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression became grimmer by the minute. But he kept stroking the chessboard and sent out the fourth batch of Regal Jade sculptures.</p>

  <p>He knew that these sculptures probably couldn't defeat the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The chessboard could only hold eighty-one pieces. If each sculpture held another one hundred divine megatons of force than the previous one, the strongest sculpture would have a force of eight thousand and one hundred divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Such power was already terrifying. It would probably be difficult for a number of powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm to reach this level.</p>

  <p>But in a battle of this level, relying on pure strength wouldn't work.</p>

  <p>Zheng naturally had his own plans. At the very least, he could use the Regal Jade chessboard to test part of the Evil God's strength, and could even predict the limits of his power.</p>

  <p>The only concern was that using this way cost too many divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Summoning all these Regal Jade sculptures would cost an astronomical number of the divine crystals.</p>

  <p>The Evil God could see Zheng's intentions, but he didn't care. Instead, he just satisfied him and showed him what he could do.</p>

  <p>He wanted Zheng to understand that no matter how much he struggled, it was all pointless. He was destined to be absorbed by the Evil God and integrated with him. The Evil God meant to destroy Zheng's confidence first.</p>

  <p>The Evil God once again destroyed the Regal Jade sculptures that Zheng had sent at him.</p>

  <p>But this time, it took the Evil God considerable effort to do it. He had to punch every sculpture to smash them into pieces. He sneered maliciously at Zheng as he said, "It's impressive but still not enough to hurt me!"</p>

  <p>Then came the fifth batch...</p>

  <p>The sixth batch...</p>

  <p>Each time, the sculptures came with increased strength. It would become more and more difficult for the Evil God to deal with them.</p>

  <p>When the seventh batch of sculptures came to attack him, the Evil God began to take caution.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>This time, the Evil God was unable to break the sculpture with his punch.</p>

  <p>Not even a crack appeared on its surface.</p>

  <p>"These sculptures could be my worthy opponents, if only in terms of force.</p>

  <p>But unfortunately..."</p>

  <p>He suddenly stretched out his hands, black bone blades extending from his arms. In a flash of movement, he rushed towards the first sculpture. Nobody knew what the bone blades were made of, but they cut through the tough Regal Jade sculpture as if cutting through a piece of tender flesh.</p>
