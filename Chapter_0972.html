<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shot up into the sky and smashed the beams. As soon as the beams broke, the house began to collapse and everything in the courtyard fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! My...my courtyard!" Mu Ning was on the verge of tears.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed inwardly. This young lady didn't seem to understand the situation she was in, but he didn't have the time or the patience to sit down with her and analyze the situation and the danger she was facing. If this matter wasn't related to Yan, he wouldn't even care about this stupid girl.</p>

  <p>Carrying Mu Ning, Luo Luo Zheng madly rushed in the direction of the transmission array. Although Ethereal City was enormous, with his current flying speed, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't take long to reach his destination.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, a strong Mu Ning descended from the sky. Luo Zheng's face fell when he sensed this Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Eddie is coming!" His eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Eddie, Mu Ning turned pale. Just a moment ago, she hadn't even been close to figuring out what was going on, but now, she knew. She'd never expected that the things the elders of the Xi Family had been worrying about would actually happen.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo!" Eddie roared at Luo Luo Zheng from above. "You're fast. But if you hadn't come here, you might have lived a little longer. Now you're courting death! I'm going to kill you today!"</p>

  <p>Eddie had once been greatly frustrated by Luo Luo Zheng, but he hadn't been able to do anything about it, because Luo Luo Zheng had been hiding in the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>However, things had changed now. There was no sect-protecting array to keep Luo Luo Zheng safe anymore.</p>

  <p>Eddie knew how good Luo Zheng's luck was. But if he didn't personally kill Luo Luo Zheng, he would never be able to live in peace.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in just two years, Luo Luo Zheng had been able to step into the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Although he was only at the primary level, his progress shocked and frightened Eddie. In another three to five years, Luo Luo Zheng would be able to break through to the Soul Sea Realm. When that time came, there was no way Eddie would be able to defeat Luo Luo Zheng. In fact, Luo Luo Zheng would be able to snap him into two as easily as snapping a twig.</p>

  <p>Eddie's grand plan was to found his divine kingdom, so he couldn't allow such a huge threat to live in this world.</p>

  <p>He had to kill Luo Luo Zheng today no matter what. For that reason, he had even temporarily stopped attacking the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Anyone could see how determined Eddie was.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng refused to listen to Eddie's nonsense. He quickly rushed toward the Sky Worm River in Ethereal City with Mu Ning, while Eddie chased closely behind him. The distance between the two of them was only a few miles.</p>

  <p>"I hope I can make it in time." Luo Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>He was dragging Mu Ning behind him. Mu Ning could only hear the sound of the wind blowing past her ears. Her mind was in a state of chaos. When Luo Luo Zheng arrived at the Sky Worm River, his heart sank. He could see two streams of black smoke coming from a distance.</p>

  <p>Even though he couldn't see the transmission arrays, he could already guess what had happened. As he flew over the two transmission arrays, he lowered his head slightly and saw that they had been charred to ashes.</p>

  <p>He didn't slow down but continued to fly ahead.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to escape through the transmission array? No way!" In order to hinder the reinforcements of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance, cutting off the two transmission arrays was the most important part of this attack on the Ethereal Spirit Sect. But Eddie hadn't expected that Luo Luo Zheng would be trapped.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Luo Zheng had nowhere to go now, Eddie didn't rush toward him. He was enjoying the process of chasing Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Luo Zheng could solve the current situation. Eddie believed that even though Luo Luo Zheng was extremely lucky, no one but Xander could save him now. However, given the current situation, Eddie was also sure that Xander, the head of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, wouldn't dare to leave his sect.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that as well.</p>

  <p>He was confident that with his current strength and cultivation level, he'd be able to escape if he unleashed his forceful energy. Unfortunately, he was carrying a burden with him that he couldn't leave behind.</p>

  <p>His face darkening, he suddenly pulled Mu Ning close.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!" Mu Ning screeched as Luo Luo Zheng pulled her into his arms.</p>

  <p>Being pressed against Luo Zheng's body, Mu Ning could feel his heartbeat.</p>

  <p>Despite the dangerous situation they were in now, Mu Ning blushed.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" she asked angrily.</p>

  <p>Ignoring her words, Luo Luo Zheng grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up onto his shoulder. The forceful energy in his body instantly erupted and mixed with the Cloud-chasing Lion's innate talent, doubling his speed.</p>

  <p>So far, Eddie had been leisurely following Luo Luo Zheng. Although Luo Luo Zheng was fast, his speed was nothing to Eddie. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng was dragging a burden behind him.</p>

  <p>So when Luo Luo Zheng suddenly turned into a thin line and explosively shot forward, it came as a shock to Eddie. Luo Zheng's speed had increased by several times.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" Realizing that he had once again underestimated Luo Luo Zheng, Eddie cursed. The forceful energy within his body started to speed up as well.</p>

  <p>But it was almost impossible for Eddie to catch up with Luo Luo Zheng now. Luo Zheng's speed was truly incomparable. Luckily, the eruption of forceful energy could only last for a very short time. It wouldn't be able to last as long as life vitality, so Luo Luo Zheng could only sprint for a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was using the eruption of his forceful energy to increase the distance between him and Eddie, the situation was still not optimistic. Eddie was still close on his tail. And the Central Region was vast; there was still a long way to go to Oracle City or the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng's forceful energy was exhausted, Eddie would catch up with him in no time.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, who was lying on Luo Zheng's shoulder, couldn't hear anything except the strong wind. Luo Zheng's speed was too fast. They had left Ethereal City in an instant.</p>

  <p>Ever since she was young, she had never left Ethereal City or ventured out on a tour. She'd never thought that the first time she stepped foot out of Ethereal City would be in such a situation.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's first wave of forceful energy depleted and Eddie's flying speed gradually increased, the distance between them grew shorter.</p>

  <p>"Eddie is right behind us," Mu Ning said nervously.</p>

  <p>"Shut up. I don't need you to remind me." Luo Luo Zheng knew that Eddie was quickly approaching. But since he was flying with just his life vitality, he wasn't as fast as Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you'd better surrender. You won't be able to escape today. Don't waste your time," Eddie said coldly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression didn't change at all. Imbuing his voice with life vitality, he replied, "Since I'll die no matter what, I have to try to find a way out.</p>

  <p>You're a sect master, so stop with the nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a sect master. I am the lord of the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom." The outside world had assumed that the Heavenly Evil Sect was a sect force, but no one dared to speak of the Heavenly Evil Sect in front of Eddie. Generally, they would call it the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Hmph! How shameless you are to claim to be the lord of the divine kingdom!" Luo Luo Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>"You're already a dead man, but you're still trying to get on my nerves!</p>

  <p>I'll make sure you die a miserable death then!" Eddie suddenly increased his speed. The fist radiance in his hand started to flicker, and a powerful Mu Ning began brewing inside his body. The moment he found an opening, he would make his move.</p>

  <p>Feeling Eddie's power, Mu Ning turned pale. Her face was filled with grief. She was afraid that she would really die on Luo Zheng's shoulder today.</p>

  <p>However, she hadn't expected that red dots of light would suddenly shoot out from Luo Zheng's body. It was none other than Luo Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Once Xun took on her complete form, she stood close to Mu Ning and, with a mocking expression on her face, gave Mu Ning a smirk.</p>

  <p>After that, she took the middle-grade sacred spear from Luo Zheng's hand and charged at Eddie.</p>

  <p>'She must be Luo Zheng's transformed sword spirit, ' Mu Ning thought to herself. She had heard that Luo Luo Zheng had a very special sword spirit, but why did his sword spirit have expressions? And why had she looked like she was laughing at her?</p>

  <p>Maybe it was just an illusion. Mu Ning began to wonder whether her eyes were playing tricks on her.</p>
