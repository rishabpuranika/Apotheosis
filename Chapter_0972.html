  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng shot up into the sky and smashed the beams. As soon as the beams broke, the house began to collapse and everything in the courtyard fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! My...my courtyard!" Margaret was on the verge of tears.</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed inwardly. This young lady didn't seem to understand the situation she was in, but he didn't have the time or the patience to sit down with her and analyze the situation and the danger she was facing. If this matter wasn't related to Yan, he wouldn't even care about this stupid girl.</p>

  <p>Carrying Margaret, Zheng madly rushed in the direction of the transmission array. Although Ethereal City was enormous, with his current flying speed, Zheng wouldn't take long to reach his destination.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, a strong aura descended from the sky. Zheng's face fell when he sensed this aura.</p>

  <p>"Eddie is coming!" His eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Eddie, Margaret turned pale. Just a moment ago, she hadn't even been close to figuring out what was going on, but now, she knew. She'd never expected that the things the elders of the Xi Family had been worrying about would actually happen.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo!" Eddie roared at Zheng from above. "You're fast. But if you hadn't come here, you might have lived a little longer. Now you're courting death! I'm going to kill you today!"</p>

  <p>Eddie had once been greatly frustrated by Zheng, but he hadn't been able to do anything about it, because Zheng had been hiding in the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>However, things had changed now. There was no sect-protecting array to keep Zheng safe anymore.</p>

  <p>Eddie knew how good Zheng's luck was. But if he didn't personally kill Zheng, he would never be able to live in peace.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in just two years, Zheng had been able to step into the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Although he was only at the primary level, his progress shocked and frightened Eddie. In another three to five years, Zheng would be able to break through to the Soul Sea Realm. When that time came, there was no way Eddie would be able to defeat Zheng. In fact, Zheng would be able to snap him into two as easily as snapping a twig.</p>

  <p>Eddie's grand plan was to found his divine kingdom, so he couldn't allow such a huge threat to live in this world.</p>

  <p>He had to kill Zheng today no matter what. For that reason, he had even temporarily stopped attacking the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Anyone could see how determined Eddie was.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng refused to listen to Eddie's nonsense. He quickly rushed toward the Sky Worm River in Ethereal City with Margaret, while Eddie chased closely behind him. The distance between the two of them was only a few miles.</p>

  <p>"I hope I can make it in time." Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>He was dragging Margaret behind him. Margaret could only hear the sound of the wind blowing past her ears. Her mind was in a state of chaos. When Zheng arrived at the Sky Worm River, his heart sank. He could see two streams of black smoke coming from a distance.</p>

  <p>Even though he couldn't see the transmission arrays, he could already guess what had happened. As he flew over the two transmission arrays, he lowered his head slightly and saw that they had been charred to ashes.</p>

  <p>He didn't slow down but continued to fly ahead.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to escape through the transmission array? No way!" In order to hinder the reinforcements of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance, cutting off the two transmission arrays was the most important part of this attack on the Ethereal Spirit Sect. But Eddie hadn't expected that Zheng would be trapped.</p>

  <p>But since Zheng had nowhere to go now, Eddie didn't rush toward him. He was enjoying the process of chasing Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was no way Zheng could solve the current situation. Eddie believed that even though Zheng was extremely lucky, no one but Xander could save him now. However, given the current situation, Eddie was also sure that Xander, the head of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, wouldn't dare to leave his sect.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that as well.</p>

  <p>He was confident that with his current strength and cultivation level, he'd be able to escape if he unleashed his forceful energy. Unfortunately, he was carrying a burden with him that he couldn't leave behind.</p>

  <p>His face darkening, he suddenly pulled Margaret close.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!" Margaret screeched as Zheng pulled her into his arms.</p>

  <p>Being pressed against Zheng's body, Margaret could feel his heartbeat.</p>

  <p>Despite the dangerous situation they were in now, Margaret blushed.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" she asked angrily.</p>

  <p>Ignoring her words, Zheng grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up onto his shoulder. The forceful energy in his body instantly erupted and mixed with the Cloud-chasing Lion's innate talent, doubling his speed.</p>

  <p>So far, Eddie had been leisurely following Zheng. Although Zheng was fast, his speed was nothing to Eddie. Moreover, Zheng was dragging a burden behind him.</p>

  <p>So when Zheng suddenly turned into a thin line and explosively shot forward, it came as a shock to Eddie. Zheng's speed had increased by several times.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" Realizing that he had once again underestimated Zheng, Eddie cursed. The forceful energy within his body started to speed up as well.</p>

  <p>But it was almost impossible for Eddie to catch up with Zheng now. Zheng's speed was truly incomparable. Luckily, the eruption of forceful energy could only last for a very short time. It wouldn't be able to last as long as life vitality, so Zheng could only sprint for a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was using the eruption of his forceful energy to increase the distance between him and Eddie, the situation was still not optimistic. Eddie was still close on his tail. And the Central Region was vast; there was still a long way to go to Oracle City or the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng's forceful energy was exhausted, Eddie would catch up with him in no time.</p>

  <p>Margaret, who was lying on Zheng's shoulder, couldn't hear anything except the strong wind. Zheng's speed was too fast. They had left Ethereal City in an instant.</p>

  <p>Ever since she was young, she had never left Ethereal City or ventured out on a tour. She'd never thought that the first time she stepped foot out of Ethereal City would be in such a situation.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's first wave of forceful energy depleted and Eddie's flying speed gradually increased, the distance between them grew shorter.</p>

  <p>"Eddie is right behind us," Margaret said nervously.</p>

  <p>"Shut up. I don't need you to remind me." Zheng knew that Eddie was quickly approaching. But since he was flying with just his life vitality, he wasn't as fast as Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you'd better surrender. You won't be able to escape today. Don't waste your time," Eddie said coldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression didn't change at all. Imbuing his voice with life vitality, he replied, "Since I'll die no matter what, I have to try to find a way out.</p>

  <p>You're a sect master, so stop with the nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a sect master. I am the lord of the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom." The outside world had assumed that the Heavenly Evil Sect was a sect force, but no one dared to speak of the Heavenly Evil Sect in front of Eddie. Generally, they would call it the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Hmph! How shameless you are to claim to be the lord of the divine kingdom!" Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>"You're already a dead man, but you're still trying to get on my nerves!</p>

  <p>I'll make sure you die a miserable death then!" Eddie suddenly increased his speed. The fist radiance in his hand started to flicker, and a powerful aura began brewing inside his body. The moment he found an opening, he would make his move.</p>

  <p>Feeling Eddie's power, Margaret turned pale. Her face was filled with grief. She was afraid that she would really die on Zheng's shoulder today.</p>

  <p>However, she hadn't expected that red dots of light would suddenly shoot out from Zheng's body. It was none other than Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Once Xun took on her complete form, she stood close to Margaret and, with a mocking expression on her face, gave Margaret a smirk.</p>

  <p>After that, she took the middle-grade sacred spear from Zheng's hand and charged at Eddie.</p>

  <p>'She must be Zheng's transformed sword spirit, ' Margaret thought to herself. She had heard that Zheng had a very special sword spirit, but why did his sword spirit have expressions? And why had she looked like she was laughing at her?</p>

  <p>Maybe it was just an illusion. Margaret began to wonder whether her eyes were playing tricks on her.</p>
