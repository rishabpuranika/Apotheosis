  <p>
</p>

  <p>Such a kind of odd thing was happening across the Source World.</p>

  <p>Severed body parts lay scattered across the devastated area of the Bloom Divine Province. Some citizens were lucky enough to survive with limbs still attached, but they were broken, all the same.</p>

  <p>Those who had lost limbs, however, didn't feel any pain. In fact, they found they could still control their severed body parts just like the hyena could.</p>

  <p>An old man's body had been halved from the waist, but he could still feel his legs. When he controlled his legs to walk, he could see the severed limbs moving in the distance.</p>

  <p>Cries of horror and confusion began to break out. "We must have been cursed!"</p>

  <p>"How can we still be alive?"</p>

  <p>The remaining creatures in the Source World wailed, aghast at their condition.</p>

  <p>Whereas before, they could look to the Other Shore for the answers to some mysteries, this was completely unprecedented.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the province where the Evil God was located had also been decimated by the needle, the black hall reduced to rubble.</p>

  <p>When the huge needle fell down from above the Source World, its gargantuan size flattened the province evenly.</p>

  <p>Most of the Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors in the black hall survived, however. They began to scramble out of the ruins.</p>

  <p>Only one Holy Soul Realm warrior was killed and three were injured.</p>

  <p>"The Source World has been destroyed, but we are still alive. Is it finally over?" a Holy Soul Realm warrior asked.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warrior next to him scoffed. "Dream on. In the past, at the end of a chaotic era, it wasn't the needle that killed people. The needle only broke the Source World. Now, we're actually in the chaos and no longer under any protection of the Source World. When that last thunder rolls again, we're doomed."</p>

  <p>An air of gloom descended over them. He was correct. The Source World had been destroyed and could no longer protect them.</p>

  <p>Just then, a Holy Soul Realm warrior not far away began sputtering loudly, "Look! What a strange phenomenon!"</p>

  <p>He was one of the three injured Holy Soul Realm warriors. One of his arms had been severed and lay hundreds of feet away from him.</p>

  <p>"What phenomenon?" an Eternal Realm warrior asked.</p>

  <p>The injured Holy Soul Realm warrior pointed at his arm in the distance.</p>

  <p>"My arm is still connected to me."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"It's true! Take a closer look if you don't believe me!" The injured Holy Soul Realm warrior concentrated on moving the severed arm. The severed arm indeed began to flex its fingers.</p>

  <p>However, the arm was a long way away from the warrior's body.</p>

  <p>"What a basic trick. How can you goof around at a time like this?" the Eternal Realm warrior said, exasperated.</p>

  <p>With their cultivation base and strength, it was too easy for them to make objects move with their mind.</p>

  <p>The injured Holy Soul Realm warrior remained adamant. "I'm not playing around! I'm telling the truth! I don't feel the injury at all. It's like that arm is still attached to me!"</p>

  <p>The warrior struggled to explain his condition.</p>

  <p>Just then, another Eternal Realm warrior piped up, "Actually, I've also been sensing something anomalous..."</p>

  <p>"Anomalous? How so?"</p>

  <p>"If you release your spiritual sense, you will know that. The entire landscape appears to be destroyed, but my spiritual sense shows me otherwise. It's like this is all an illusion," the Eternal Realm warrior said.</p>

  <p>The other Eternal Realm warriors and the Holy Soul Realm warriors hurriedly tapped into their spiritual senses then.</p>

  <p>A sense of unease came over them as they saw the anomaly for themselves.</p>

  <p>Some of the Eternal Realm warriors used the Grand Teleportation technique to get around the broken landscape to confirm what they were seeing.</p>

  <p>Rocks, mountains, and trees all seemed crushed to the naked eye and touch, but they remained fully intact under the lens of the spiritual senses.</p>

  <p>The dissonance was disorienting.</p>

  <p>High up in the sky, Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven hovered side by side, observing matters.</p>

  <p>The two of them had keen senses and had already detected the abnormality in the Source World much earlier.</p>

  <p>"Everything in this world appears destroyed, but everything is actually intact. There must be some force behind this. What do you think, Master Duran?" The Grandmaster of Heaven himself was stumped.</p>

  <p>"It must be related to the Evil God somehow. He would probably know," said Duran.</p>

  <p>"He disappeared without a trace the instant the needle descended. Even his avatars are gone. I don't know what he's planning," the Grandmaster of Heaven grumbled. He was really hoping the Evil God didn't escape.</p>

  <p>He knew that everyone, including the Evil God, couldn't escape after the Source World was destroyed.</p>

  <p>"I'm figuring out how to restore the Source World."</p>

  <p>The voice of the Evil God suddenly rang out around them.</p>

  <p>Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven watched as the real Evil God slowly materialized in the distance.</p>

  <p>"That would be impossible," the Grandmaster of Heaven scoffed, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"The Source World has already fallen. You would have lost the power of the primitive land along with it," reminded Duran.</p>

  <p>The Source World, the Burial Land, and Zheng's primitive land all got a portion of separate space from the chaos. When one collapsed, the invisible boundaries would disappear, and the space would merge with the chaos.</p>

  <p>Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven, of course, assumed the Evil God was no longer the controller of the Source World because the Source World no longer existed.</p>

  <p>The corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up. "That's where you're wrong."</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>Blue light beams flickered behind him. The Evil God's avatars appeared one after another until tens of thousands of them hovered in the air.</p>

  <p>"What?" The Grandmaster of Heaven could only gawk in shock.</p>

  <p>"You haven't lost the power of the Source World!" Duran exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Because the Source World hasn't collapsed," the real Evil God said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"How could you say that?" The Grandmaster of Heaven pointed at the horizon, where a huge crack merged desolately with the chaos.</p>

  <p>"It is not what it seems," the Evil God said dismissively. "Watch."</p>

  <p>The Evil God stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his wrist, pieces of the broken landscape began to move.</p>

  <p>Pebbles gathered together until they reformed into boulders. Trees, mountains, rivers all returned smoothly to their original state.</p>

  <p>Everything within a hundred miles were restored to their previous condition. The ruins had all disappeared. It was as if the needle had missed the area.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven could hardly believe it. "How did you do that? That's astounding!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I activated the Restriction Field as the needle shot towards the Source World. It can resist any hit, protecting everything therein," the Evil God replied.</p>

  <p>"That's amazing!" Duran exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Doing so, I discovered something new about the Restriction Field," the Evil God went on, motioning to the distance. "After being hit by the needle, many fragments of the Source World erupted into the chaos.</p>

  <p>Those materials are still within the Restriction Field."</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"It means that the further those fragments go, the bigger the Source World would be," the Evil God replied.</p>
