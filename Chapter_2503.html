<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chose to continue exploring the palace after jumping out of these rings.</p>

  <p>Behind the main hall was another hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pushed open the door and stepped inside, his expression shifting.</p>

  <p>This hall was hundreds of times wider than the main hall with seven rings. It looked like it was anywhere between 30, 000 and 40, 000 feet high.</p>

  <p>It was so huge that it could fit an ordinary-sized mountain within it!</p>

  <p>In the middle of the hall stood a huge statue.</p>

  <p>"Three heads and six arms?"</p>

  <p>This three-headed statue almost reached the roof of the hall.</p>

  <p>The three heads all had the same face, but with varied expressions. The one in the middle was angry, the one on the left was happy, and the one on the right was sad.</p>

  <p>All six arms held different weapons: a machete, a sword, an axe, a dagger, a hammer, and a crossbow.</p>

  <p>"This is the Soaring Snake Sword!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened at the realization.</p>

  <p>The sword that the statue was holding was exactly the same as the one Tianming had used in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"This must be Chiyou's statue!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng understood now.</p>

  <p>The figure of the man Luo Zheng had seen in the Divine Time Temple was that of Chiyou when he had created the divine land. He didn't have three heads or six arms.</p>

  <p>This statue before him was perhaps another of Chiyou's incarnations.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up at the statue for a while.</p>

  <p>If what his mother had said was true, he was Chiyou's grandson.</p>

  <p>A mighty warrior as Chiyou who had created the divine land had actually had to help his people escape! Just how powerful did his enemy have to be?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>He could hardly imagine such a confrontation.</p>

  <p>It was also beyond Luo Zheng's imagination that the beast bones at the bottom of the chaos really existed outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>After observing the statue for a while, Luo Zheng looked at the wall at the back of the hall.</p>

  <p>The wall was about 40, 000 feet high and had words of a huge size inscribed on it.</p>

  <p>"These words could only have been left by Chiyou," Luo Zheng concluded and then began to read the words on the wall.</p>

  <p>His mother had told him that Chiyou himself didn't use Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The words engraved here on the wall were ordinary ones.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could feel the injustice and humiliation Chiyou had felt radiating off the scribbles.</p>

  <p>"I'm Chiyou, the leader of the Nine Li people, and a good enough warrior. But I've just suffered a big defeat. I was not willing to take my defeat lying down, so I made a ship to help tens of millions of my people leave. I hope they survive! And I hope the Chaos Ancient God helps the Nine Li people!"</p>

  <p>The words left on the wall only endorsed what Luo Zheng's mother had said.</p>

  <p>Chiyou had built the divine land as a retreat for the Nine Li people.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, not long after, the Nine Li people had been killed by the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>How many Nine Li people still survived in the divine land, except himself, his mother, and Harper? How many Nine Li Guards were left?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wondered and sighed.</p>

  <p>He swept around the hall one more time and when he didn't find anything that was special, he decided to leave.</p>

  <p>Three days later, at dusk.</p>

  <p>When the sun reached the top of the Sunrest Tree again, a figure holding an umbrella flew out of the rolling sea of fire on a flying sword.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In the sky, Luo Zheng stepped on his flying sword and fell rapidly.</p>

  <p>When he got out of the area that the Sun Essence Flames had covered, he took off the Sun-resisting Umbrella and put it away.</p>

  <p>He fell for six hours before the Sunrest Tree finally appeared before him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned the flying sword under his feet slightly into a different direction and began to speed away.</p>

  <p>The divine land was simply too vast. Despite the fact that Luo Zheng continued to fly with the help of the flying sword, it took him several hours before he finally arrived over the Heavenly Sword Divine City. It was five o'clock in the morning when he laid eyes on the city.</p>

  <p>He had barely reached the city when several guards of the Sword Clan rushed over to him.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Why are you breaking into the Heavenly Sword Divine City?" one of the guards shouted.</p>

  <p>Flying was forbidden in the Heavenly Sword Divine City, as it was in a vast majority of the divine cities. Luo Zheng was so eager to enter the city that he had forgotten about this.</p>

  <p>The guards didn't know who Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was about to explain himself when Marsh materialized beside him.</p>

  <p>"Master Marsh!"</p>

  <p>"Master Marsh!"</p>

  <p>Although the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan often stayed in the Heavenly Sword Divine City to guard the city, ordinary True Gods rarely had the chance to see them. That was why the guards were being so respectful towards Marsh.</p>

  <p>"Don't be rude to an honored guest of the Sword Clan," Marsh said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>The guards bowed to him and retreated.</p>

  <p>Marsh turned to Luo Zheng with a smile. "We've been waiting for you," he said.</p>

  <p>He then led Luo Zheng into the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Harold, Yan, and Gibson had gathered to welcome Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, how are you?"</p>

  <p>The only thing that Yan cared about was her brother and whether he had emerged unscathed or not.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. The Sun-resisting Umbrella protected me enough that the Sun Essence Flames didn't hurt me one bit," Luo Zheng said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Yan heaved a sigh of relief and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what is the situation now? Why did the divine land quake so terribly?" asked Harold, concerned.</p>

  <p>"I succeeded in the beginning." Luo Zheng frowned. "It was pretty easy to control the movements of the divine land in that hall."</p>

  <p>"And now?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>"A band of red light appeared at the bottom of the chaos, circling the divine land. I manipulated the divine land, trying to get rid of the band, but in the end, I could not. The divine land has stopped falling now but I just can't seem to get rid of the light band," Luo Zheng repeated what he had seen.</p>

  <p>"You mean, the band of red light has bound the divine land?"</p>

  <p>Harold asked, his eyebrows disappearing into his hairline.</p>

  <p>Marsh and Gibson looked at each other, astonished.</p>

  <p>As Holy Beings, they were well aware of the massive size of the divine land. Even the universes they had built were as tiny as ants on the surface of the divine land.</p>

  <p>What kind of light band was strong enough to bind the entire divine land together?</p>

  <p>How long was the band? What kind of powerful force could stop the divine land from falling?</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>"Yes, absolutely. I had observed it for a long time. The band came from below the divine land, the bottom of the chaos," Luo Zheng said with certainty.</p>

  <p>Harold's mouth dropped open in shock.</p>

  <p>It was quite a sight to watch Harold drop out of his calm demeanor and look so shocked.</p>

  <p>"Harold, do you have any idea about what's going on?" Marsh asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Harold was silent for a while before he decided to speak. "My master told me many years ago that the legendary Source World isn't the only place where extraordinary creatures live. There are a large number of creatures at the bottom of the chaos that are despised by the Chaos Ancient God. They are known as the Out-of-Land Fiends in the Source World."</p>
