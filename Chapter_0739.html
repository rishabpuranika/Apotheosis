<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Any treasures that could strengthen the power of the soul were extremely rare, so they were invaluable.</p>

  <p>The Soul-nurturing Jade could only be considered as a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>However, there were numerous fairy weapons in the Central Region, but only a few could strengthen a soul's power.</p>

  <p>Even in the World Commercial Alliance, this Soul-nurturing Jade was considered as a valuable item.</p>

  <p>When Nate heard that Dillon was going to give Luo Zheng the Soul-nurturing Jade, he felt that Dillon's decision was a bit unfair. However, he didn't dare to say anything. Whatever he would say would only invite insult to himself.</p>

  <p>In comparison to Luo Zheng, the runic experts were useless men, good for nothing.</p>

  <p>The truth was that they were not amateurs. After all, their rune techniques represented the highest level in the Central Region. In particular, Nate was the only one who was able to draw a five-star rune. If he served for any sect, he would be highly valued by that sect, and he would be treated as if he were their top treasure.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was outstanding, they paled in comparison with Luo Zheng. They were not in the same league.</p>

  <p>Dillon's offer of the Soul-nurturing Jade was a nice gesture with which to befriend Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance had made a move really fast. The three leaders had recognized Zheng's value the moment Michael passed Zheng's first rune work to the headquarters of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>But they didn't expect that the situation would change so quickly. Back then, Luo Zheng appeared from the Dragon Soar Arena. To settle things, Dillon offended Luo Zheng by questioning him about the secret of the Dragon Soar Arena. And soon after, he met Luo Zheng during the Martial Arts Contest.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance was, of course, not afraid of Luo Zheng. But they valued great talents and would spare no efforts to attract them. That was why the World Commercial Alliance had developed and thrived to what it was today.</p>

  <p>The Soul-nurturing Jade was offered to Luo Zheng as compensation. It wasn't too late for Dillon to make amends.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng politely accepted it. He knew the value of the Soul-nurturing Jade.</p>

  <p>Though this Soul-nurturing Jade would be of little use to Luo Zheng since his soul had entered the Fighting Soul Realm, he could gift it to someone else or sell it and make a fortune.</p>

  <p>After accepting the Soul-nurturing Jade, Luo Zheng turned to the stewards and said, "I've just finished drawing these runes, but I'm not sure if they will work properly."</p>

  <p>The stewards of the World Commercial Alliance put the last three stones that carried the four-star runes Luo Zheng had drawn into place. After that, Xiao took out an array plate and prepared to test the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Nate and the others viciously hoped that the runes wouldn't work and that the enchanted barrier wouldn't perform its function.</p>

  <p>However, what happened next disappointed them. As soon as Xiao activated the array plate in his hand, it began to spin. An enchanted barrier spread out from the edge of the arena and quickly gathered toward the top, forming a complete luminous curtain that encased the arena.</p>

  <p>The first luminous curtain appeared, followed by the second, the third, the fourth…</p>

  <p>There were six luminous curtains in total. They were closely connected and glowed softly.</p>

  <p>The lights emitted from the six luminous curtains were more solid and stable than the previous enchanted barriers! This was the effect of the Perfect Brushwork! Luo Zheng used his Perfect Brushwork to activate the properties and energy of the materials to their greatest extent. As a result, the power of these enchanted barriers was stronger and was more resistant to heavy blows.</p>

  <p>"Very good! It seems that everything works fine now!" Dillon was very satisfied with the enchanted barriers. "Mr. Luo, here are the fifty thousand supreme life vitality crystals we promised as your reward!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Dillon finished speaking, a steward brought a plate. On it was a token made of purple crystal. "You can use it to withdraw fifty thousand supreme life vitality crystals at any World Commercial Alliance bank," he said to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and put the purple crystal token into his space ring.</p>

  <p>"It's finally fixed! The battle can begin again! Where's the banker? Hurry up! Announce the odds so we can take the bet!"</p>

  <p>"How much did Luo Zheng earn by repairing the runes?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you hear? Fifty thousand supreme crystals, more than what I earned in the past two years while at a third-grade sect."</p>

  <p>"This is crazy! That kid is rich. Let's rob him!"</p>

  <p>"Haha! First of all, you are definitely not his match. And second, the sect you belong to wouldn't be a match for Cloud Hall. You want to rob him?</p>

  <p>You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>After almost two hours of waiting patiently, the crowd of warriors began buzzing again.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng returned to the high platform where the people of Cloud Hall were seated, Xiao nodded in satisfaction and began drawing lots.</p>

  <p>The competition of the Martial Arts Contest had begun again.</p>

  <p>The situation in the arena hadn't changed, however. The warriors from various sects still had the upper hand. When warriors from sects encountered independent warriors in a battle, the warriors from sects were always victorious.</p>

  <p>However, a dark horse appeared among the independent warriors. He was Owen from the Woollen Grassland.</p>

  <p>Even though he was only at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, Owen had defeated two sect warriors in a row with this scimitar!</p>

  <p>His performance surprised all and stirred the crowd.</p>

  <p>After all, most warriors in the grandstand were independent warriors or warriors from third-grade sects. They were not eligible to join large sects, but they always had the mentality that independent warriors were not inferior to sect warriors.</p>

  <p>Owen's performance boosted their confidence. Moreover, Owen was only at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, and it was an amazing feat for him to defeat Internal Elixir Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>There were ten matches in the Lucky Draw box. Owen's name-tag appeared for three battles. Surprisingly, Owen won all three matches, which made the whole competition reach its climax. In an instant, the atmosphere of the entire arena became heated. The banker also repeatedly increased the odds for Owen's battles.</p>

  <p>After Owen finished his third battle, he began to draw his card. In the first two rounds, he got exemption cards. However, in the last, he drew a challenge card.</p>

  <p>After Owen obtained the challenge card, he began to circle the arena to pick his opponent.</p>

  <p>"He got a challenge card. Whom does he want to challenge?"</p>

  <p>"Will he challenge Brent of the Ethereal Spirit Sect? I heard that Brent is the only one who has divine-level talent in the whole of Ethereal Spirit Sect. They are both at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. So it's highly possible that Owen will choose Brent."</p>

  <p>"Is it? I think he will most likely challenge Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Owen's eyes quickly swept past the side platform where independent warriors were seated. Then his eyes ran down the high platform, and finally, they rested on Luo Zheng. Their eyes met for a moment.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flickered, 'Does he want to pick me?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Owen smiled faintly and shifted his gaze away from Luo Zheng. His eyes swept past the people from the Ethereal Spirit Sect and fixed on the high platform where the Evil East Lord sat. He stared at a woman in that area.</p>

  <p>Behind Eddie stood two women, and one of them was Zheng's sister, Yan, whose six senses were sealed. Beside Yan stood another woman, whose six senses were sealed as well. When his eyes fell on the latter, Owen looked grieved, and he tightened his grip on the scimitar.</p>

  <p>But soon, the sadness in his eyes disappeared. Instead, he looked more determined. He raised his voice and shouted, "I will challenge the independent warrior, Marilyn Si!"</p>

  <p>"What?!" Zheng's eyes flashed. At the same time, he looked at the area where Eddie was seated, his mind a mess. 'Why did Owen pick Marilyn?'</p>

  <p>Owen had participated in the pre-qualifying match on the same day as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On that day, Luo Zheng had used the twelve-level pagoda to extort him ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>But Owen, who came from the Woollen Grassland seemed to be quite wealthy, as he gave a lot of supreme life vitality crystals to Luo Zheng without batting an eye.</p>

  <p>Owen's cultivation base was at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. He was able to challenge an Internal Elixir Realm warrior; thus, his real strength was something to be reckoned with. Regardless, Luo Zheng didn't expect that Owen would challenge Marilyn.</p>

  <p>"Could it be that he has the same goal as me?" Zheng's heart suddenly beat faster. Luo Zheng looked in the direction where Yan stood. Beside Yan stood another woman. Luo Zheng had noticed her earlier before. She was the third person who had the Purple Power Body. If it hadn't been for her, Luo Zheng wouldn't have faced such a grim situation. Of course, Luo Zheng wouldn't blame it on her.</p>

  <p>Did Owen come here for her? It was highly possible!</p>

  <p>What was her relationship with Owen? It didn't matter anymore.</p>

  <p>"It's getting tricky!" Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>Marilyn was his target. She must die by his hands. Before he achieved his goal, Luo Zheng did not want any mishaps to happen. If Owen killed her in battle, it would be the best result for Luo Zheng. But if he failed to kill Marilyn, then Marilyn would be alerted. This was not what Luo Zheng would expect to see.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng couldn't stop him. Perhaps, at this moment, Owen had the same thoughts as he did.</p>

  <p>"Challenge me? Hahahaha..." Marilyn walked gracefully forward and said with a charming smile, "You want to kill me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Owen's and Zheng's hearts suddenly tightened. They turned red in the face.</p>
