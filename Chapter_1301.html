<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1301 The Supreme World Channel </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Before entering the transmission array, Luo Zheng had noticed that the divine textures on it were unique.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, transmission arrays were constructed by runes and driven by life vitality crystals. The principle was usually quite simple.</p>

  <p>The runes were used to make a transmission channel that was connected to the array in another place. The transmission channel could shorten the distance between the two places. For the warriors who previously spent several days flying to Cloudy City from Oracle City, it only took them less than five minutes to get to the destination through the transmission channel.</p>

  <p>However, the structure of this transmission array was completely different. Although the divine textures were unfamiliar to Luo Zheng, he could roughly guess at how they were put to use.</p>

  <p>Not only did the transmission array expand outward and form a transmission channel, it seemed to connect to something else. As for what it was, Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>As the armored warrior activated the transmission array, the warriors who had ascended to the Upper World formed a queue. With a flash of white light, they entered the flying passageway.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng first entered the flying passageway, nothing seemed abnormal about it. It looked almost the same as the one in the Lower World. The entire channel was azure in color.</p>

  <p>Not long after, they passed through the azure transmission channel.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a large transmission channel appeared before them.</p>

  <p>"The transmission channel is so stable!" Luo Zheng said as his eyes landed on it.</p>

  <p>This giant transmission channel was purple in color. Normally, a channel would only be thirty to forty feet wide, but this particular one was over one thousand feet broad.</p>

  <p>What surprised Luo Zheng most was that the channel was much more stable than an ordinary one. The surrounding space seemed to be frozen, so it might not be easy for anyone to break through it...</p>

  <p>However, just as they entered, they saw two warriors fly over from the other side of the transmission channel.</p>

  <p>They looked down at the warriors from the Lower World. One of them chuckled. "We won't be able to accept all of them at the same time. It seems there are more than a thousand warriors here who have entered the Upper World."</p>

  <p>The armored warrior who was escorting Luo Zheng frowned. "They are all useless. The test is about to begin, and can our Spiritual Force Sacred Place count on these filthy warriors from the Lower World to pass?" He took out over a thousand supreme life vitality crystals from his space ring. "This time it's quite a number of them who have to use this transmission channel. Can you give me a discount?"</p>

  <p>The man counted the life vitality crystals and smiled faintly. He picked hundreds of life vitality crystals and handed them back to the armored warrior. "Don't talk to me about a discount. After all, it's the Spiritual Force Sacred Place that pays the money..."</p>

  <p>The armored warrior distributed the returned life vitality crystals among his colleagues, handing them each a few pieces. Clearly, the life vitality crystals were now their own.</p>

  <p>After this was done, the armored warrior spoke to the other warriors.</p>

  <p>"All right everyone, follow me. Let's continue moving forward!"</p>

  <p>Although many warriors from the Lower World were dissatisfied with the armored warrior's words, they didn't act rashly. They followed the armored warriors and continued advancing along the transmission channel.</p>

  <p>"Where did the light purple transmission channel come from? Why do we need to pay a fee to pass through it?" Luo Zheng asked the cyan dragon since he naturally did not want to inquire the armored warriors about this.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon smiled. "This sort of large-scale transmission channel is the supreme world channel. Only the world lords or those at higher positions can create it."</p>

  <p>"The supreme world channel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a supreme world is too vast. In the Central Region, a small transmission channel can be built for a length of just over a hundred thousand miles. If it's too long, it would be difficult to stabilize," the cyan dragon informed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding. He thought of the super transmission array built by Immoral Mist. It connected the Central Region to the Sea God Continent, but since the distance was too much, the transmission channel was extremely unstable. While traveling to the Sea God Continent from the Central Region, he had encountered an intense space windstorm and almost died at that time. Even after returning from the continent, he still suffered heavy injuries even though his cultivation base had steadily increased.</p>

  <p>The size and depth of a supreme world were far beyond the imaginations of the warriors of the Lower World. If a Soul Sea Realm warrior wanted to cross a supreme world, it would take him hundreds of years to do so, not just one or two.</p>

  <p>However, there were countless capable warriors in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Almost every supreme world had a supreme world channel to connect to other supreme worlds. Some channels were quite long.</p>

  <p>It took a great deal of effort and time to construct these transmission channels, so maintaining them was naturally not an easy task either. The warriors had to pay a toll fee when passing through these channels. It cost each warrior one supreme life vitality crystal right now. Their journey was short as they only needed to travel two to three million miles along the transmission channel. If they had to cross the entire supreme world, the toll tax might reach over ten thousand supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>As for the cost of crossing more than one supreme world, it might surpass one million supreme life vitality crystals...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was very rich. Once he had dug up minerals in the four divine kingdoms, he exchanged them for a great number of supreme life vitality crystals. But now, it was shocking to him that for all his wealth, he could not even travel across the supreme world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed and followed the others as they flew through the enormous transmission channel.</p>

  <p>One hour later, the armored warrior in the lead stopped and entered a side passageway. They reached the normal transmission channel and very quickly left it altogether. A dark and steep mountain appeared before them.</p>

  <p>"This is..." one of the warriors began as he stared at the black mountain.</p>

  <p>When an armored warrior heard this, he sneered. "This is the place where you all are to do forced labor. According to the rules of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, if you want to join us, you have to dig up one hundred life vitality jades!"</p>

  <p>"Life vitality jade?"</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>The armored warrior snickered. "I know that you do not know what a life vitality jade is, but the mountain in front of you is a vein of the life vitality crystal. There are life vitality crystals of all levels, including low-grade, top-grade, and even supreme ones. Of course, there are also life vitality jades, but if you cannot dig out the jades then you can exchange ten thousand supreme life vitality crystals for a life vitality jade. Your task would be complete if you dig up a million supreme life vitality crystals."</p>

  <p>The warriors now understood what they were being asked to do.</p>

  <p>The best life vitality crystals in the Lower World were at the supreme grade. They never thought that there would be a purer life vitality crystal in the Upper World� the life vitality jade.</p>

  <p>The warriors were expected to dig out one million supreme life vitality crystals. They began murmuring among themselves. It was shocking!</p>

  <p>Wasn't that too big a number?</p>

  <p>The warriors who had ascended to the Upper World were undoubtedly at the top in the Lower World and wealthy enough. Before flying over to the Upper World, they had not taken many life vitality crystals with them. Some of them might have about ten thousand supreme life vitality crystals in their possession, and some just over a hundred...</p>

  <p>One million supreme life vitality crystals was a substantial fortune in the eyes of any Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms could be considered relatively wealthy. But, there were less than two hundred thousand supreme life vitality crystals stored in their national treasuries. It was unprecedented that they were required to offer up one million supreme life vitality crystals if they wanted to join the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"One million life vitality crystals!"</p>

  <p>"How long would it take for us to dig up so many crystals?"</p>

  <p>"We would have to spend several hundred years here..."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to join your Spiritual Force Sacred Place!" a warrior spit out in annoyance. "I just want to be an independent warrior!"</p>

  <p>The armored warrior chuckled. "You want to become an independent warrior? Well, then you have to provide two hundred life vitality jades!"</p>

  <p>Two hundred life vitality jades... That equaled two million supreme life vitality crystals!</p>

  <p>"That's absurd! Why?" the warrior shouted in anger.</p>

  <p>The armored warrior was still smiling. "You flew into our Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Now you have to obey us."</p>

  <p>His tone was condescending and familiar. The Soul Sea Realm warriors immediately grew silent. They had cultivated in the Lower World for a long time before they reached the Soul Sea Realm. How could they not understand what was going on here?</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances, it was useless for them to ask why, for the answer was already obvious. They were only Soul Sea Realm warriors and would be unable to revolt against a large sacred place of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Seeing the dejected warriors, the armored warrior took some pity on them. "Be mentally prepared and get to work. The Spiritual Force Sacred Place is quite lenient. Some other sacred places are even harsher!"</p>
