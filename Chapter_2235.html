<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although this group of people made quite a havoc in the Han Clan's territory, they were also well aware of what was more important.</p>

  <p>It was nothing more than a basic prank. At first, when Keenan had started picking on Aleyna and Kelsey, he didn't have any intentions of hurting anyone.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng stepped in, though, things became a little more subtle.</p>

  <p>Although the Liu Clan's Floating Island didn't rank high, it was still one of the richest and most powerful clans. It was a great shame that Keenan had been fooled by a proving godly warrior using different Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>If they were outside of the Time Sea, this might not have been a problem, as there was such a long distance between the wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>But right now, these huge Floating Islands were close to each other. No matter what happened, the news would spread in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew everyone around here. Keenan was too pissed to swallow his fury.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he felt very serious.</p>

  <p>From the top of the silver flute, a bright silver light suddenly burst out.</p>

  <p>Numerous mysterious thin rays spread out from it.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Luo Luo Zheng felt there was something familiar about the burst of light: Chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing the burst of chaotic energy, everyone present began to show signs of fear. The top-rank True Gods in the hall were no exception.</p>

  <p>Anyone below a Holy Being's status was completely unable to resist the chaotic energy's erosion. Neither a consummate True God nor a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly. Seeing as the flute could emit such chaotic energy, it was logical to deduce that it was a supreme chaotic weapon. And upon noticing the nervous warriors in continuous retreat, Luo Luo Zheng knew that Keenan's next move was bound to be extremely fierce.</p>

  <p>'I sense trouble, ' he thought solemnly to himself.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Luo Zheng's dull eyes suddenly lit up. This time, not only did he refuse to retreat, but he rushed toward Keenan with speed and might.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy could be seen pouring out from the silver flute and it was slowly circling around, preparing a killing tactic. How could an ordinary person even dare to approach such danger? Even just a tiny amount of chaotic energy could, and would, be a problem.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, didn't have to deal with this psychological burden.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy's poison wasn't harmful to Luo Luo Zheng in any way. In order to avoid making himself too ostentatious, Luo Luo Zheng gently twisted his body and found a gap to dodge through.</p>

  <p>"Is that guy going to stop Keenan?!" someone shouted in surprise.</p>

  <p>"He is much too bold. Encountering chaotic energy is far from being pleasant..."</p>

  <p>"Does he really think that he could be a match to Keenan?" someone else retorted.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had just fooled Keenan with several Divine Dao, no one imagined that he'd be stronger than a True God. Even among the low-rank True Gods, Keenan was one of the strongest. In other words, to everyone watching, Luo Zheng's charge forward was nothing more than asking for his death.</p>

  <p>As Keenan watched Luo Luo Zheng take the initiative to come at him, he felt absolutely overjoyed.</p>

  <p>He only used the Holy Zakaria Flute at moments of crisis. The flute was one of the two supreme chaotic weapons of the Liu Clan. His father had given it to him and forbade him to take it out of Time Sea. Every time he went to a forbidden land, he was obliged to give the Holy Zakaria Flute to his father before his departure.</p>

  <p>If the power of the Holy Zakaria Flute were to break out completely, the hall would probably be destroyed. Even more problems would arise if the chaos became a disturbance to the Han Clan elders. If such were the case, Keenan would be punished severely.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng charged toward him powerfully, a fierce light flashed in Keenan's eyes. He reached out his hand and gently pinched the Holy Zakaria Flute.</p>

  <p>A whistling sound split through the air immediately, and the chaotic energy was slowly absorbed back.</p>

  <p>Keenan gently waved his hands together at the same time, and the momentum within his body rushed toward his Godly Tile. Since Luo Luo Zheng had dared fool him, he would let him know what a miserable price he would have to pay.</p>

  <p>Even though Keenan had used his momentum, he still hadn't applied his Godly Way. He wasn't out of tactics, yet.</p>

  <p>Using momentum went hand in hand with using Faith Energy. That said though, the Godly Tile could help the Faith Energy play its role to an extreme!</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about it. Keenan was going to tear Luo Luo Zheng to shreds in the most obvious and grotesque way possible!</p>

  <p>The very second Luo Luo Zheng was standing before him, Keenan's body exuded momentum and every inch of his muscular body surged and pulsed. His arms were raised in the air, as if they contained endless power. This strength came partly from his corporeal body, but most of it was formed by his momentum.</p>

  <p>As his arms clashed together, his hands transformed into two giant tiger claws and he fiercely grabbed at Luo Luo Zheng. He was as fast as lightning and grabbing onto Luo Zheng's arms was no problem at all.</p>

  <p>"Boy, don't be a hero if you don't have the strength!" Keenan spat coldly, staring at Luo Luo Zheng who was now only inches away from his face. Although Keenan knew he was younger than Luo Luo Zheng, he was sure that he had a higher cultivation base than him, and therefore, he treated Luo Luo Zheng like a junior warrior. "You don't get the chance to regret your actions, though. My warning has come too late. Alas..."</p>

  <p>With a gentle sigh, his only remaining desire was to tear Luo Luo Zheng apart.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing..." Kelsey murmured, completely startled. She tried to stop Keenan, but it was too late.</p>

  <p>Liusu's heart began beating faster and faster.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, she had originally planned to let Aleyna compete with Tianxing to find out his identity. After watching Luo Luo Zheng display all sorts of Divine Dao first hand, she had begun to doubt her own intuition.</p>

  <p>It was in that split second that the premonition in Liusu's heart became extremely strong and sensitive. She couldn't ignore it any longer.</p>

  <p>Her judgments were based on a certain logic. This Tianxing guy was definitely not a mediocre warrior, considering his capacity of mastering six or even seven kinds of Divine Dao at the same time.</p>

  <p>Such a smart individual just couldn't be stupid enough to rush towards Keenan unprepared. He must have the needed confidence and skill!</p>

  <p>In this respect, he was very much like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had seen Luo Zheng's horrifying strength in the past. Luo Luo Zheng had obtained plenty from exploring the Collapsing Mountain race that year.</p>

  <p>In only a few more moments, she would know whether this Tianxing guy was truly Luo Luo Zheng or not.</p>

  <p>The other warriors from the wealthy clans were all calm now. Only a few of the Han Clan members were considered untouchable. As for everyone else, if someone was killed, the family could choose whether or not to scold the killer. Moreover, word of the deceased wouldn't even be spread throughout the clan.</p>

  <p>Beneath everyone's longing gaze, Luo Luo Zheng surprisingly displayed a relaxed expression. He smiled at Keenan and said, "You calling me boy? You know you have no right to call me that..." After saying such words, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly began wriggling his body on the spot.</p>

  <p>As he squirmed ceaselessly on spot, Luo Luo Zheng activated the nine stars and motivated an enormous force.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's movement wasn't extremely fast, but because of the power infusion, it was too heavy for Keenan to react. When he clenched Luo Zheng's arm, he felt a huge force escape it, which was much greater than that of anyone he had ever fought in his life before!</p>

  <p>With the strength Luo Luo Zheng was exuding from his arms, Keenan was soon tossed into the air toward the hall's ceiling by force.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A milky white glaze lamp was hanging from the hall's ceiling. Keenan smashed directly into the lamp, and it immediately shattered, falling to the ground in hundreds of sharp little pieces. Keenan, too, smashed violently down to the ground.</p>

  <p>Before his body was even completely splayed out on the floor, Luo Luo Zheng kicked him hard in the ribs.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng figured that since he had already offended this Keenan guy by defending Aleyna and Kelsey, he decided to teach him a good lesson.</p>

  <p>And what was more, Keenan had even tried to kill him!</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the fact that he had a couple scruples concerning the wealthy clan standing behind Keenan, he would have sliced him in half with his Great Weighty Sword!</p>

  <p>With a roar, Keenan's body looked like a folded, half empty sack of flour.</p>

  <p>He went crashing into a wall on the other side of the hall, and his body sprawled helplessly out on the ground.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the hall was now staring at Luo Luo Zheng intensely. Previously, they hadn't cared about Luo Zheng's background or name. Now though, something had changed. Their hearts and minds were full of questions. When had this guy shown up exactly? And why had they never heard of him before?</p>
