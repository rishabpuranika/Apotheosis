<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every woman in the Purple Soul Hall was considered the pride of their clan, having entered the center of the divine land and become a disciple of a powerful clan on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Once expelled from the Floating Island, they could only expect to face an unimaginable nightmare.</p>

  <p>What these women hadn't expected though, was that the day before yesterday, news had been received that the princess of the Han Clan, Liusu, had defeated the anonymous man. This man had taken part in many battles against opponents of a higher level and lost to Liusu.</p>

  <p>The princess had earned nearly two million points!</p>

  <p>In other words, that was the equivalent to the Han Clan suddenly having one more consummate True God, out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>It was this news that pulled the Purple Soul Hall disciples out from the abyss of desperation.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who the anonymous man was? A proving godly warrior who could accumulate several million points... How unbelievable! It almost killed me just to accumulate two hundred points," a woman sighed.</p>

  <p>"Ha-Ha! What's important here is that the anonymous man was defeated by the princess, and he lost most of his points to her - points that he had earned through his hard work. I believe that the anonymous man must be very sad!" said another woman, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Think about it, all of you! Why exactly was this anonymous man defeated by the princess? It has been said that this anonymous man is from our Han Clan. He was surely defeated by the princess on purpose!"</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that's true?" someone questioned.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it. The princess' strength is extraordinary. She was originally ranked third among the low-rank True Gods. I think it's normal for this anonymous man to be defeated by her!"</p>

  <p>As they listened, many women widened their eyes in surprise.</p>

  <p>The information that the True Gods and the proving godly warriors at the bottom of the clans could get was rather limited. Now, although the powerful clans were all sure that the anonymous man came from the Han Clan, or more precisely, from the Purple Soul Hall, most of the women in the Purple Soul Hall still weren't aware of the latter.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat on the edge of the viewing deck and stared out at the boundless Time Sea. As he listened to the various discussions and speculations that rose to his ears, a faint smile spread on his lips. At least, he had helped Joy in keeping the Purple Soul Hall, and he had also become a True God in a rather smooth manner.</p>

  <p>Ever since condensing his Godly Tile, he felt that the Faith Energy within his body was becoming stronger and stronger, but he never had the chance to test its strength. Furthermore, he didn't dare enter the Arena of Legends again, especially not at such a sensitive time.</p>

  <p>Joy had secretly told him not to act rashly during this period. After the rankings were decided, the Dongfang Clan was very likely to come to the Han Clan in order to take Zheng away at any moment, and when that occurred, she too, would be placed under a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>'I wonder how Liusu is doing these days.' Thinking about how Liusu had looked that day, Zheng felt as though a needle had pierced directly into the softest spot of his heart. Seconds later though, a cold glint flashed across his eyes. 'Forget it. All these distracting thoughts should go away once I enter the Everest Spirit Mountain...' he told himself.</p>

  <p>Once the Floating Islands' rankings were decided, the forbidden areas were bound to be opened. As long as he entered the Everest Spirit Mountain, everything would be over, and the pressure from the Dongfang Clan would naturally disappear. Who cared if they ultimately discovered his true identity?</p>

  <p>Despite having these thoughts, Zheng still felt somewhat uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Tianxing, you've only been here for a few months and yet you've already proven the Godly Way! You're improving incredibly fast! I'm impressed!" a pretty woman suddenly said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's admission to the Purple Soul Hall as a man was quite eye-catching and attention grabbing. More so, he broke through to become a True God not long after his admission here, which naturally drew even more interest from certain women.</p>

  <p>"I have been staying at the proving godly warrior level for thousands of years now. It was only after I came to the Floating Island that I understood the subtleties of the Purple Soul Hall and overcame the bottleneck, which helped me in becoming a True God," Zheng said with a faint, shy smile.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that explains it! You're lucky. Over thirty years have passed since I came to the Purple Soul Hall, but I haven't made any progress," the woman said, shaking her head in despair.</p>

  <p>"There will always be other opportunities. When it comes to cultivating a Godly Way, it's usually the smallest opportunities that make the biggest difference. Trust me, I'm speaking from experience," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, you're right." The woman nodded and suddenly pointed down.</p>

  <p>"Look," she said. "The Floating Islands are moving. The ranking process has begun..."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a dull roar, Zheng saw the two Floating Islands - one of the Xie Clan and the other of the Liu Clan, which were at the bottom, began to rise slowly. Simultaneously, the Floating Island of the Luo Clan began to descend slowly. So much so, in fact, that it was about to fall into the Time Sea!</p>

  <p>"What happened? "Harold has defeated Rachelle in the open battle and won many points for the Luo Clan, hasn't he? Why is the Floating Island of Luo Clan falling now? How is this possible?" Zheng asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were filled with anxiety and confusion. As the Luo Clan's Floating Island continued falling, his heart couldn't help but sink along with it.</p>
