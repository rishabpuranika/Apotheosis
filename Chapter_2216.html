  <p>The clouds around the Floating Island of the Han Clan were unmoving and unnaturally quiet. It brought about a mysterious atmosphere, almost too calm to enjoy.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Luo Zheng was on the disk and gracefully rose up into the sky.</p>

  <p>As he stood there, he looked down at the Time Sea. From up there, the Floating Islands below resembled a pearl necklace floating majestically above the ocean.</p>

  <p>He even caught sight of the center of the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, he could not seem to figure out where the Hall of Holy Beings was because of the thick clouds that surrounded him. For all he knew, formidable power could have been contained in those clouds, but it was too difficult to see through them.</p>

  <p>As he kept on moving and searching around, the disk he was on finally approached the giant Floating Island of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Once it landed, Mae jumped off first in pure excitement. Luo Luo Zheng followed suit and leaped off. As soon as they were off the disk, it hovered into the air and automatically flew back to its dock at the bottom.</p>

  <p>Mae continued to lead Luo Luo Zheng forward. "You can enter the Floating Island because you have a Purple Power Body," she explained. "But I'll take you to the Purple Soul Hall first."</p>

  <p>The Floating Island of the Han Clan was divided into two separate parts.</p>

  <p>The members of the Han Clan took up most of the area, while one-sixth of the entire island belonged to Joy. Joy, the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan, built the Purple Soul Hall on the island, so it did not have any connection or relation to the Han Clan at all. It was solely Joy's place, and she was the master.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng was not yet part of the Han Clan, Joy freely invited him to the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>"I do not seem to have a Purple Power Body..." Luo Luo Zheng said with concern in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Mae responded, "I know, but as far as I'm concerned, you can cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao. You probably have the Purple Power Body already."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what to respond. He was not planning on explaining the matter of the Infinity Ruler, because that would be an easy giveaway. If she thought that he had the Purple Power Body, then he decided it would be best to just let her believe so.</p>

  <p>All along, Luo Luo Zheng thought they were going to the city. However, Mae made a detour and didn't bring him there at all.</p>

  <p>Not long after, they finally reached their destination? the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>The Purple Soul Hall was a very large, glorious, and luxurious place.</p>

  <p>There were beams of purple light slowly flowing in random patterns with unique energies and auras. Luo Luo Zheng even suspected that the entire palace was formed through the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique.</p>

  <p>"Mae, you're back?"</p>

  <p>As soon as they reached the gate, a woman dressed in blue walked up to them in a hurried pace.</p>

  <p>She had the cultivation base of a low-rank True God, yet did not seem so intrigued to meet Mae, a top-rank True God. She just greeted to her casually, as if they were longtime friends. At the same time, she glanced at Luo Luo Zheng who was behind Mae, and a mix of shock and happiness plastered across her face. "Everyone, come here and have a look!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Mae has found another junior for us! He is a young man!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what the woman in blue said, about ten women immediately rushed out from random areas and made their way towards them. Some of them were proving godly warriors and others, low-rank True Gods. They all had distinct yet attractive appearances, and seeing that all of them were women, they also probably didn't see men so often.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this was why they rushed to see Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing their reactions, Mae rolled her eyes, saying, "My master isn't strict enough with them, so they always behave like this. You'll get used to it..."</p>

  <p>Although many warriors in the divine land possessed the Purple Power Body to cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao, they were merely a small part of the many divine citizens. Still, it was a coincidence that they were able to gather in the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>Here, Joy and the others didn't have any sense of superiority or inferiority. Therefore, in the Purple Soul Hall, the disciples saw one another as peers, with Joy as the all-knowing master. The atmosphere was always respectful and pleasant, and everyone got along with whoever was there.</p>

  <p>Notably, there were very few male disciples residing in the Purple Soul Hall, so every male disciple caused a ruckus among the females.</p>

  <p>Soon, a dozen pretty women surrounded Luo Luo Zheng, and some even pointed at him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Is he from a poor family? He wears a simple long robe. Does he always dress so... simply?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, I don't feel the Mu Ning of the Purple Power Body coming from him.</p>

  <p>Can he even manage to cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"Who cares! He is very handsome.</p>

  <p>Is he really the person recommended by the Heavenly Han House?"</p>

  <p>Hearing all these murmurs, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but break a sweat. A few drops trickled from his forehead down to his neck as he realized he had never been put in this situation before. Should he have been here in the first place?</p>

  <p>"Everyone, our junior fellow disciple has just arrived. He must be tired because of the long journey, so I must arrange a place for him to rest now. Don't make any noise." Mae already knew this was going to happen, and she also knew that there was no way to get out of it.</p>

  <p>There were two kinds of disciples in the Purple Soul Hall. The first type were the ones taught by Joy personally, while the second type were the ordinary disciples. Mae was one of the disciples who Joy handpicked, but she didn't dare to berate other female disciples. If she did that, she knew they would throw a fit. If the master knew such things, she would not scold those disciples who disobeyed the rules but instead, would rebuke Mae. As a result, there were no rules in the Purple Soul Hall. All of them treated each other as blood sisters.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't really think I'm your junior fellow disciple," Luo Luo Zheng said to Mae.</p>

  <p>Mae let out a disheartened smile. "Even though you are not accepted as a disciple, we will take you as our junior fellow disciple.</p>

  <p>Male disciples in our Purple Soul Hall are very popular, and very rare."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained speechless once again. Everything was normal on the way to the Purple Soul Hall, but things changed so drastically just because of these women.</p>

  <p>"Hi! Nice to meet you, my dear junior!"</p>

  <p>"Your physical age seems less than a hundred years old. Is that right?</p>

  <p>You are so young..."</p>

  <p>"Mae, let me be the one to arrange his living space. I can also tell him about the rules of the Purple Soul Hall!"</p>

  <p>With the enthusiastic help from the giddy female disciples, Luo Luo Zheng was able to settle down quite smoothly.</p>

  <p>The Purple Soul Hall occupied one-sixth of the area of the Floating Island, while the number of the female disciples who had the Purple Power Body was only one tenth of that of the Han Clan's disciples. That made the Purple Soul Hall quite large in comparison to the rest of the places, so Luo Luo Zheng got his own place just for him.</p>

  <p>The fact that Joy owned this entire place showed that she was quite influential. If the land on the Floating Island could be sold, the Floating Islands would probably be the most expensive place in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even the disciples from the Han Clan were only given small living places if they did not have the special identity and high status. Ordinary outer disciples who entered the Floating Island resided in a common room, and the True Gods were no exception to this.</p>

  <p>But Joy, however, was very nice to those who followed her and gave them the best benefits as the master. She was the one to personally ask the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan to give her such a large chunk of land.</p>

  <p>But because there were only a few of them, the place was more than enough for all of them to thrive individually and together. Luo Luo Zheng was allocated to a small palace as soon as he came in, and this made the other members envious of him. However, they knew that they didn't have the Purple Power Body, so they couldn't enter the Purple Soul Hall under any circumstances anyway.</p>

  <p>At night, the thick fog still hovered over the Floating Island, but it lightened a little bit compared to earlier in the day.</p>

  <p>With the dim moonlight, Luo Luo Zheng could tell the giant islands above him, looking like giant meteors in the sky. They were the Floating Islands of other several great clans.</p>

  <p>"The Luo Clan has its own Floating Island. As a Holy Being, my master must have one island too. Why didn't I see his island on the way?" Luo Luo Zheng asked Master Evil.</p>

  <p>Although this was the first time Master Evil had ever entered the Floating Island, he was possibly already knowledgeable about these things because he had lived in the divine land for a long time.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Holy Gu Bei is very formidable, even though his clan is not regarded as very powerful. Although he has only accepted two disciples, they prove to be top warriors with extraordinary strengths. With these two remarkable disciples alone, the Floating Island of the Gu Clan always managed to be ranked as one of the top five islands. That was the situation before I was taken away by Gu Bei. I have no clue of what is its ranking now. But, I know that it must be above the Han Clan's island,"</p>

  <p>Master Evil explained. He didn't know much, but this was already common knowledge.</p>

  <p>"So this means that the Gu Clan's Floating Island is located at a higher place..." Luo Luo Zheng responded as he absorbed everything Master Evil said.</p>

  <p>When he heard Master Evil mention the two disciples of his master, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly recalled the time he met Gus along his journey on the True Path. At that time, Gus had given Luo Luo Zheng some advice and recommended the Eight Smoky Melodies, Thunderbolt Annihilation and Enemy Repelling Arts for Luo Luo Zheng to cultivate.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the actual names of my master's two disciples," Luo Luo Zheng uttered.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Master Evil let out a soft chuckle. "As the junior fellow disciple of Augustus Yu and Hallet Jing, you don't even know their names? You truly are quite a joke, Luo Luo Zheng."</p>
