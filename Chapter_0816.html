<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's body had come to the limits. He distanced himself from the three ogre war lords and stared at them vigilantly.</p>

  <p>But the thing that made Zheng curious was that when the three war lords saw the scene before them, their expressions changed.</p>

  <p>"Why is it here?" one of the war lords shouted.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be trouble," another war lord said as he stared at Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>The three strong war lords glared fiercely at Zheng, but none of them charged at him.</p>

  <p id="top_7">Zheng's body tensed. He had been ready to fight to the death at any moment, but now he was filled with doubt. Why weren't the ogres attacking?</p>

  <p>The incandescent light in the transmission array suddenly came back on.</p>

  <p>Phoebe, the girl from the Demon Night walked out of the transmission array. Her intelligent eyes swept across the scene around her, and with graceful steps, she walked past the three war lords towards Zheng, completely ignoring them.</p>

  <p>Zheng's confusion increased as he saw this scene.</p>

  <p>The girl was only a war general, yet she was indifferently confident in front of war lords.</p>

  <p>The girl strolled leisurely towards Zheng, looking at his perplexed eyes with a smile. "You're wondering why they aren't making a move. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Phoebe extended a hand, splaying her fingers and gestured. "This is the center of the Sea God Continent, the land where all beings are cursed.</p>

  <p>Those who attack here will be cursed to death. So…" The girl turned around and stared at the three war lords with a smile. "That's why they don't dare to make a move!"</p>

  <p>"Cursed Land?" Zheng's eyebrows went up.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Phoebe laughed. "No one can make a move in the Cursed Land. Furthermore, if a warrior above a war lord steps into the Cursed Land, he will also be killed by the curse."</p>

  <p>"A warrior above a war lord?" Zheng asked, his breath catching.</p>

  <p>A war lord was as strong as a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and a warrior above a war lord was as powerful as someone at the Life and Death Realm. Even a Life and Death Realm warrior could be killed by a curse. The Cursed Land was much more terrifying than what Zheng had imagined.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," Phoebe said, nodding. "The transmission array is actually a trap to trick war sages into entering the Cursed Land and then use the power of the Cursed Land to kill them. But it's a pity that these three are only war lords.</p>

  <p>Or they would have already been killed by the curse."</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>The chaotic continent, or the Sea God Continent she spoke of, was odd.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't from the Sea God Continent, so he didn't know the history behind it.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Cursed Land was set up in the Sea God Continent, countless transmission arrays had been constructed in various places by various races.</p>

  <p>They had even left special marks on the arrays in order to trap war sages.</p>

  <p>In the earliest days, many war sages were unintentionally sent to the Cursed Land and killed.</p>

  <p>Later on, the war sages of the Sea God Continent had an unwritten rule: never enter any transmission array. If one entered a wrong transmission array, he would definitely be killed, and that would be too unfair.</p>

  <p>The three ogres were just war lords. If they had been war sages, they would never have dared to follow Zheng into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>Zheng had earlier felt strange that the transmission arrays appeared out of nowhere in the wilderness. It wasn't until he listened to Phoebe's explanation that he understood that these transmission arrays were used to trap and kill war sages.</p>

  <p>"You are lucky this time, you brat! Don't think for one second that you will be safe on this Cursed Land. I'm sure that if you dare go to the Tower of Sin, you will die miserably!" an ogre war lord sneered.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," another war lord said through gnashed teeth, looking coldly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The three war lords then returned to the transmission array. After they put down some life vitality crystals, they slowly disappeared in a flash of white light.</p>

  <p>"Tower of Sin," Zheng repeated, as if in a daze.</p>

  <p>The purpose of Zheng's trip to the Sea God Continent was the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the tower was located in the Cursed Land?</p>

  <p>Phoebe smiled slightly. "What? So you know about the Tower of Sin?"</p>

  <p>Phoebe was curious about Zheng's identity. He seemed to know nothing, not even the rules of the Cursed Land. But it looked like he knew about the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"Right. Where is the tower?" Zheng asked, growing serious.</p>

  <p>"I can take you there. But first, you have to tell me about your sword spirit,"</p>

  <p>Phoebe answered.</p>

  <p>As Zheng had expected, the people of the Demon Night had paid attention to him only because of his sword spirit, Lily. It seemed that his guess was right.</p>

  <p>"You mean her?" Zheng smiled, and a red light flashed as his sword spirit, Lily appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>To his utter surprise, just as he summoned Lily, Phoebe knelt down on one knee and softly said, "Greetings, my Queen."</p>

  <p>"Queen?" Zheng repeated, dumbfounded at Phoebe's words.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is a queen of the Demon Night. Why does your sword spirit look exactly like my queen?" Phoebe asked.</p>

  <p>How could he explain?</p>

  <p>Zheng had obtained Lily at the Killing Sword Mountain. He himself was unable to explain why Lily would turn into a member of the Demon Night after absorbing a certain amount of sword spirits. It was so weird that even the cyan dragon couldn't explain it.</p>

  <p>It was even stranger now. Phoebe was telling him that his sword spirit was a queen of the Demon Night!</p>

  <p>"I don't know how to explain to you why my sword spirit transforms into this figure," Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Phoebe's face was filled with doubt.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was an extremely powerful race in the Upper World. On the Sea God Continent, there was also a sacred place, which was one considered most sacred among the major races in the continent. Phoebe had seen the statues of queens in this sacred place.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night had three statues in the Upper World and many other worlds.</p>

  <p>The three statues corresponded to the three queens of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The first statue was called the Queen of Eternal Night.</p>

  <p>The second statue was called the Queen of Demons.</p>

  <p>And the third statue was called the Queen of Killings. Zheng's sword spirit looked exactly like the Queen of Killings.</p>

  <p>In fact, even greater doubts had troubled the Demon Night, because among the three statues that had originally shone with holy light, the statue of the Queen of Killings had already lost its luster.</p>

  <p>That was why Phoebe had felt so strange when she saw Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng seemed not to know anything, Phoebe had to give up for the time being. She had to wait until Elder Mei arrived before she could solve this problem.</p>

  <p>"Alright, I've answered your question. Now, you have to tell me about the Tower of Sin," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Phoebe nodded, but she did not immediately answer his question. Instead, she smiled and asked, "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"My name is  Zheng Luo. What about you?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Phoebe," she answered. She turned around, extended a slender finger pointing in a direction, and said, "The Tower of Sin is right in front of us.</p>

  <p>Let's talk as we walk."</p>

  <p>On their way, as Phoebe explained everything, Zheng began to have a rough understanding of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin had appeared along with the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>The enormous Tower of Sin was located right in the middle of the Cursed Land. There were thirteen great races and more than thirty small races throughout the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Humans belonged to one of the thirteen great races. They had established their own sacred place, the Purple Heart Sacred Place, at the northern end of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>But of the sacred places built by the thirteen great races, the Purple Heart Sacred Place was almost ranked the last.</p>

  <p>Zheng had heard from the ogre war lords that the humans of the Sea God Continent seemed very weak. And now, as he heard what Phoebe said, they were indeed much weaker than Zheng had imagined.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, the Eastern Region, and the four divine kingdoms, humans were absolute powerhouses. Other races could hardly survive. Yet, they were not the masters of this continent, and this quite surprised Zheng.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before he discovered why.</p>

  <p>It was because the strongest warriors of the Sea God Continent were all from the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>There were cultivation resources in the Tower of Sin that exceeded Zheng's imagination. They had become must-haves for every race. So the most important thing for every race was to send their people into the Tower of Sin, where they could cultivate and fight for the resources. But war sages were unable to enter the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"You'll know more after you enter the Tower of Sin," Phoebe said, watching him with a slight smile on her face. Her goal was to follow Zheng until Elder Mei arrived. What she had just said wasn't a secret, so she didn't hesitate to tell him that.</p>

  <p>They couldn't fly, so they merely walked on the ground. But as warriors, they could still be extremely fast even if they just ran on the ground. After a few hours of running, Zheng finally saw a huge tower looming up ahead of them.</p>

  <p>"That's the Tower of Sin," Phoebe said, pointing to a large structure that was now not far away from them.</p>

  <p>Zheng found that the Tower of Sin was actually inverted.</p>
