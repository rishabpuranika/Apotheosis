<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"He's certain of himself... You're absolutely right!" Fuxi nodded. "He wasn't afraid that we would know about his deeds and be alert given his arrogant character."</p>

  <p>The very first time Fuxi laid eyes on the Evil God, he already hated the guy.</p>

  <p>It was at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World where they first met and Fuxi wanted so much to kill him but couldn't due to the overall situation.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded with a smile. "That's right. This is not something he needs to think about."</p>

  <p>"How should we counterattack?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi had a worried look on his face.</p>

  <p>It was not easy for him to return from the Other Shore and he did not want to hide in the Pear Hill all his life.</p>

  <p>A few days ago, Eastern Emperor Taiyi gathered Pearce, Auden and a few other important officials to discuss the Oneness Sky Palace's reconstruction.</p>

  <p>The disciples were able to return to the Bloom Divine Province with Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin's leadership.</p>

  <p>He was extremely happy to have heard the news about Yellow Thearch's and Divine Farmer's death and he felt it even more reasonable for them to return to the Bloom Divine Province now that there was no more threat of powerful enemies.</p>

  <p>However, he soon found out that it wasn't good news at all. There was a huge crisis behind it all!</p>

  <p>"How do we counterattack?"</p>

  <p>"This guy's ability is really too strange and remarkable."</p>

  <p>"He seems to be able to possess other people's bodies at will."</p>

  <p>Everyone saw via the Memory-recording Crystal just how the people of Moon Shield City suddenly turned into the Evil God with no warning at all whatsoever.</p>

  <p>If the Evil God entered the Pear Hill and took over the bodies of all Eternal Realm warriors, then the possibility of a counterattack would be null.</p>

  <p>"There must be some restrictions to his power," Judson muttered lazily. "If he can possess other people's bodies at will, then he could've turned Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer into him, but why didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"You're right." The Snake Goddess nodded. "Master Gerald, have you ever heard of such a method?"</p>

  <p>Gerald was lost in thought after watching the Memory-recording Crystal.</p>

  <p>He was more shocked than anyone else after having observed the Evil God's methods.</p>

  <p>A green light soon flashed in Gerald's eyes. "Life controlling."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a burst of power spread out from his body.</p>

  <p>Several peacocks with blue tail feathers walked arrogantly under the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>However, when Gerald released his power of truth, one of the peacocks trembled and its eyes turned dark green. The next moment, it jumped up and stood in the center of the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>Once it landed, it suddenly morphed into a burly, human man.</p>

  <p>The aura he emitted was by no means small and he was as powerful as a Holy Soul Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Gerald said, "I can do this. I can directly control creatures and infuse my own strength into them. For those at the Holy Soul Realm, I can control forty to fifty at most...</p>

  <p>The Evil God can control over ten thousand people with cultivation and strength no different from his own. That's not something within my range of expertise.</p>

  <p>If I'm not mistaken, he is able to do that by using the power of the Source World. Although it's not as pure as the power of truth, it is terrifyingly strong and he can use it at will.</p>

  <p>Due to these circumstances, I have a suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>"We leave the Source World," Gerald replied.</p>

  <p>Since the Evil God now controlled the Source World, it was obviously not a wise choice to attack him in his domain.</p>

  <p>"Leave?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that we have to escape from the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Is it appropriate?"</p>

  <p>His suggestion greatly shocked everyone.</p>

  <p>There was no way the Snake Goddess was willing to leave the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin shared her thoughts and were also unwilling to give up the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan shared the same sentiments. The Ear Mice were the original inhabitants of the Source World. If they left, they would lose everything.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng and Fuxi were very taken with this suggestion.</p>

  <p>Fuxi did not like staying in the Pear Hill and preferred to travel the world.</p>

  <p>Zheng, meanwhile, was not a native of the Source World. If he left, he could return to the divine land. "If we can't think of a way to counterattack, we can choose to temporarily avoid the danger."</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess shook her head. "The Pear Hill is the foundation of our race. We can't give it up so easily."</p>

  <p>Gerald nodded in understanding. "Of course. I understand you're not willing to leave but..."</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to finish his words, his expression suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>The previously green eyes of the man who was transformed from the peacock soon turned into two, black flowers that emanated a strong, evil aura.</p>

  <p>Someone was trying to control him!</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" Gerald shouted.</p>

  <p>His anger effectively drove the unknown invader as a ray of dark green light filled the man's eyes again and expelled the darkness.</p>

  <p>However, traces of black light remained within the edges of his pupils that continued to replace Gerald's dark green light.</p>

  <p>It was a battle of control and Gerald was not backing down.</p>

  <p>A strong amount of life energy gushed out of his body and onto the man.</p>

  <p>The green soon won over the dark and tiny vines grew out from his eyes.</p>

  <p>Two forces currently fought within the man's mind.</p>

  <p>It was the kind of power that could be considered the strongest in the chaos. The man was only a temporary form for the peacock, so how could his physical body withstand such opposing forces?</p>

  <p>It was understandable for the man to scream in pain.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>As he screamed, his body swelled up.</p>

  <p>With the sudden turn of events, Kendrick quickly pointed his finger and summoned hexagonal enchanted barriers to surround the burly man.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound as the man's body exploded and turned into a mist of blood that splattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Kendrick's enchanted barriers, nobody got splashed by the man's blood.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At this time, a strong gust of wind began to blow from the top of the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>Thousands of dust grains gathered from the force generated by the wind and soon formed a man in the air. This man had the same appearance and build as the Evil God's.</p>

  <p>"No wonder you're the Chaos Ancient God in charge of life truth. You can actually take the control away from me," the Evil God said to Gerald.</p>

  <p>A pair of compound eyes on Gerald's head glared coldly at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"You are nothing without the Source World's power."</p>

  <p>It was true. Without the Source World's power, the Evil God was just a Holy Soul Realm warrior who did not have much to offer at all.</p>

  <p>"Without the life truth, you're even worse than a good-for-nothing!</p>

  <p>Hahaha..." The Evil God, instead of getting mad, laughed.</p>

  <p>Gerald hadn't been at a disadvantage when he fought the Evil God for the man transformed from the peacock earlier.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Evil God failed several times in trying to gain the upper hand.</p>

  <p>So in a fit of rage, he decided to make the man explode.</p>

  <p>He was millions of miles away, but had he been in the same vicinity, then Gerald would not have won the fight.</p>

  <p>After laughing, the Evil God turned to Zheng. "You've let me down even more," he said in a mocking tone. "You planned to run away before seeing me. I didn't think you'd be such a coward."</p>
