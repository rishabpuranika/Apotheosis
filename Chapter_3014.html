<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3014 The Imperial Sword Seal </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Athemar smiled faintly. "This is my Other Shore Token, the Enlightenment Sword. Of course, what you see is but a projection onto the Lofty Sword."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token was very important to any warrior at the Other Shore Realm. Athemar wouldn't place his prized token in the Seven-Star Province.</p>

  <p>However, using a special method, one could project their Other Shore Token onto a treasure.</p>

  <p>This was most evident in the use of an Other Shore Token's projection to allow the Trumpet Flying Ship to travel through the void.</p>

  <p>In this case, the Lofty Sword was a treasure that Athemar created with his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Zheng gazed at the light golden ancient sword in confusion. No matter how powerful the projection of the Other Shore Token was, he couldn't own it.</p>

  <p>Before reaching the Other Shore Realm, his inner world could not take in any Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"The Enlightenment Sword is a great treasure on the Other Shore. It doesn't have outstanding power, but it can give you an Imperial Sword Seal,"</p>

  <p>Athemar said confidently.</p>

  <p>"Imperial Sword Seal? What's that?" Zheng asked, squinting.</p>

  <p>"You'll know it soon. The Enlightenment Sword is the only one of its kind,"</p>

  <p>Athemar answered with an arrogant air about him.</p>

  <p>Floating in space, the Enlightenment Sword began to rotate slowly. After a few circles, its blade was aimed directly at Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I have to move." No. 9527 sighed resignedly, as it shuffled a bit to dodge the blade.</p>

  <p>Then Zheng felt a stabbing pain in his chest. The diamond-shaped sclerite on his chest moved quickly.</p>

  <p>The sclerite was sharp. When it moved, it sliced through Zheng's muscles.</p>

  <p>Such an injury was nothing to him, as he would recover soon after, but that didn't mean he didn't feel the pain it inflicted.</p>

  <p>Just as No. 9527 moved away, the ancient sword shot towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>It moved so fast that Zheng barely had the time to react.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the sword stabbed Zheng's chest, going clean through him.</p>

  <p>However, as the sword was but an illusion, it didn't leave any physical wounds on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had moved away in time, or it'd be troublesome if Athemar discovered its existence.</p>

  <p>"Check your chest," Athemar instructed.</p>

  <p>Zheng unbuttoned his jacket and saw a faint sword freshly imprinted on his chest.</p>

  <p>"This is the Imperial Sword Seal, an innate theurgy of the Enlightenment Sword. Many others have begged me to give them the Imperial Sword Seal, but I refused. It's my generous gift to you," Athemar said, grinning proudly.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. He knew Athemar was strong, but he was way too conceited.</p>

  <p>"But you haven't explained the function of the Imperial Sword Seal yet,"</p>

  <p>Zheng reminded.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any top-grade sword?" Athemar asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>It was absolutely impossible for him to take out the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, he flicked his hand. A long sword that emanated a cyan light materialized before him. It was the sword that the Sword Light Palace gave him.</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me? That's just scrap metal!" Athemar cried exasperatedly.</p>

  <p>"This is the sword given by the Sword Light Palace," Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>"Well then. I'll teach you how to use the Imperial Sword Seal, and then you can apply it to the sword," Athemar said with a reluctant smile.</p>

  <p>He began to chant a spell.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Sword Seal might have had some mystery about it, but the spell to activate it was actually quite simple. Zheng picked it up easily and mastered it within seconds.</p>

  <p>As he recited the spell from heart, he suddenly felt his blood surging throughout his body. The aura of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent gathered in his chest immediately. A burning sensation raged in his chest, and a golden light shot out from the Imperial Sword Seal imprinted on his chest.</p>

  <p>Once the light landed on the cyan sword, it transformed dramatically.</p>

  <p>As he held the handle of the sword, Zheng could feel the power surging within the sword. The force was so strong that it could split the heaven from earth.</p>

  <p>"This power..." Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly.</p>

  <p>"You can release it," Athemar reminded. "Don't worry. You can't damage the inner walls of the Lofty Sword."</p>

  <p>Zheng was actually planning to do that. Hearing Athemar's encouragement, he no longer had any scruples. Immediately, he brandished the sword and slashed forward.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Golden threads of light burst forth. They moved in an almost random way, but each strand was incredibly sharp.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The threads cut the inner walls of the Lofty Sword, leaving crevices on the surface.</p>

  <p>However, there was no need to worry, as the Lofty Sword could repair itself. The crevices soon were sealed.</p>

  <p>"It's not bad," Zheng said with a faint smile, as though he couldn't hide the disappointment in his heart. While the threads were sharp, he could tell they were weaker than his Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Athemar could tell that Zheng was upset. He snorted. "Not bad? It is a waste for you to use the Imperial Sword Seal on this piece of scrap metal. In the future, you will know its true power!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat. "Are you saying that the Imperial Sword Seal isn't activated by my Truth of Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>He had just felt that the Imperial Sword Seal had absorbed his Truth of Godly Way, so he thought it was a truth theurgy. Moreover, it was not as powerful as his Ways-blending Energy, so he had been quite disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Of course not! It's related to the grade of the sword you use," said Athemar, as though the fact was so obvious.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart beat wildly at this.</p>

  <p>The magic weapons in the Source World were graded in a different way.</p>

  <p>The cyan sword, as the standard sword of the Sword Light Palace, was considered ordinary. It was inferior to some of the swords Zheng had brought with him from the divine land, among which were some top-grade magic weapons that were given to him by the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>More importantly, he had the Soaring Snake Sword! Zheng's excitement grew as he explored this thought.</p>

  <p>If the cyan sword, which was deemed "scrap metal" by Athemar, could bring out such power, how much more power could the Soaring Snake Sword release?</p>

  <p>Noticing Zheng's strange expression, Athemar chuckled. "You have some amazing treasures with you, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression fell as he struggled to conjure some excuse.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," Athemar continued, as though reading Zheng's thoughts. "I won't grab a junior's treasures."</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't know that Zheng had Chiyou's sword. If he knew that, perhaps he would have changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have the Imperial Sword Seal, you can leave. Stay at the Sword Light Palace. I will send someone to Seven-Star Province." As he spoke, a circular arch materialized before them again.</p>

  <p>Zheng bowed respectfully and then headed into the arch.</p>
