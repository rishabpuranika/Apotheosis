  <p>
</p>

  <p>"All the three thousand great ways could help you condense Godly Tiles.</p>

  <p>In the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, there aren't rules of heavens that have been established. Therefore, it's hard for you to become a True God. With your power though, it is much easier for you to condense a Godly Tile, in comparison to the others..."</p>

  <p>The strength of Chapman, Kaydan and the other elites of their races far exceeded that of a world lord and resembled much more that of a Supreme Lord. However, their power was still at world lord level, because they didn't carry the Heavenly Destiny and didn't condense a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>That said though, they were world lords who could still exert their power to the extreme.</p>

  <p>They were more powerful than top-level world lords and could even compete with the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>If they cultivated the Godly Way which was suitable for them, breaking through would be completed with ease.</p>

  <p>"Each individual only has a single chance. Thus, success depends on one's own comprehension ability," Holy Jay explained faintly.</p>

  <p>Natives from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land stared at Holy Jay, their eyes sparkling, as if they were afraid to miss or misunderstand any detailed or critical information. This might be their one and only chance.</p>

  <p>"The Collapsing Mountain race's focused on practicing physical strength.</p>

  <p>The amount of warriors in the divine land who concentrate on cultivating Might Godly Way is actually quite small. But we shall never underestimate the True Gods who practice Might Godly Way. If their mastery of power is great, they can break absolutely anything with a single fist."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay took a sudden step forward. The invisible force surged out from beneath his feet!</p>

  <p>His body contour wasn't as big as that of the Collapsing Mountain race, but everyone knew that body size wasn't the standard of measuring a person's power.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, and in the eyes of all the witnesses, Holy Jay had become the embodiment of power, and he could crush anything!</p>

  <p>In fact, he didn't even exert all of his power: probably less than ten percent of Chapman's strength. However, no one could deny that the destruction caused was hundreds of times more than what Chapman could ever manage.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay slowly walked toward Chapman, as the invisible power hovered beside him before turning into a teeny-weeny crystal.</p>

  <p>The colored crystal looked very much like strength source.</p>

  <p>"Lo-Lord... This is just strength source." Chapman had no idea how to address Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay's face revealed a cold smile. "The Might Godly Way is the most arbitrary one. You never formed Path Platforms nor condensed nine stars, but you absorbed quite a lot of my strength source. Thus, you are able to directly practice the Might Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>Upon finishing his speech, he pointed his finger at the tiny crystal of strength source which began to glow brilliantly. Holy Jay then poured this strength source into the brains of all members of the Collapsing Mountain race present.</p>

  <p>In each of their minds, a colorful strength mansion suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>The majority of body refiners in the divine land mainly cultivated the Might Godly Way, forged Eight Path Platforms and constructed Nine Divine Stars. But it didn't mean body refiners were obliged to follow this journey. The way imparted by Holy Jay was to forge the strength mansion. If it coordinated with the strength source of the Collapsing Mountain race, then one would have a rather strong opportunity at becoming a True God.</p>

  <p>The whole of Collapsing Mountain race knelt down to express their appreciation, a pious look combined on all their faces.</p>

  <p>Kaydan and Tilton just stared at Holy Jay in pure awe.</p>

  <p>When it came to Harmony race, they were usually quite good at keeping an indifferent tone and attitude. Yet when something so good happened to them, even they couldn't keep to their indifference.</p>

  <p>This time, Holy Jay had really acted upon greatness. He gave everyone direction.</p>

  <p>Other universes were capped by heavens, but The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was an open world.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe's shackle was the Mahayana Lotus Flower and Hinayana Lotus Flower. No one but those who opened the Mahayana Lotus Flower was qualified to comprehend Godly Way and become a Godly Genius. In a certain way, to a warrior, this was a kind of ball and chain.</p>

  <p>Originally, Luo Zheng hadn't opened the Mahayana Lotus Flower fully, so he couldn't break the rein of heavens. Naturally, he couldn't become a true Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>But the natives in Divine Refinement Forbidden Land weren't bound by heavens, therefore they were all considered Godly Geniuses and thus qualified for cultivating Godly Way. On the other hand though, they didn't have the ability to comprehend Godly Way without such a shackle.</p>

  <p>With the instructions given by Holy Jay, it was possible that they could get a glimpse of the Godly Way theurgy. And judging from this point of view, the shackle in heavens was also a stimulating factor for any warrior. Once one broke the rein of heavens, it became natural for them to comprehend Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Every single native in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was grateful for the master's gift.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my lord. If we turn into True Gods, we will give our all for you until our hearts cease to beat!" Kaydan said gratefully.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay remained unruffled. Every stone and every existence was created by him in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Their appreciation wasn't of much importance to him. "I did this for the young man beside you. He will go to your sacred places and cultivate there. If you want to express your gratitude, thank him."</p>

  <p>At his words, Chapman, Kaydan and Tilton were suddenly filled with deep esteem.</p>

  <p>Chapman announced loudly, "Collapsing Mountain race is open to you as of right now!"</p>

  <p>"Sir, you focus on life vitality cultivation. Skyland race is definitely your best choice. As the head of Skyland race, I also welcome you to come at any time..."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Their words came directly from their hearts, without the slightest trace of pretension.</p>

  <p>Tianming just nodded slightly, pensively. He knew he should lay a solid foundation and would cultivate himself step by step. Until now, he hadn't yet completely understood the laws in Wind Exterminating Valley.</p>

  <p>Skyland race was his next step.</p>

  <p>The warriors from these three races were satisfied with what they had obtained today. In fact, what they gained this time was far beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>"You are free to leave now," Holy Jay ordered them.</p>

  <p>Without a second of hesitation, Chapman, Kaydan and the others left immediately, their clansmen following close behind. Only the warriors from the universes and those of the divine land stayed put.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had sealed their six senses. They couldn't move at all, and thus just stood there motionlessly.</p>

  <p>"What about these guys?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>"Leave them alone," Holy Jay said indifferently, looking out at the warriors from divine land. That was when he turned around and headed toward the cave, hands clasped behind his back.</p>

  <p>Behind the door was a completely void world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had gotten separated from the Divine Flame Cauldron.</p>

  <p>The nine Genuine Dragons' spirits were hovering around the Divine Flame Cauldron. Luo Zheng appeared to be unconscious, as if he had fallen into a coma. His hands were hanging lifelessly by his sides. He floated within the void space and kept completely motionless.</p>

  <p>Black tempestuous flames were rising within the giant Divine Flame Cauldron, so fierce it appeared as though they would devour everything.</p>

  <p>Even Holy Drew couldn't expose his flesh body in black fire like this. A yellow ray was protecting him.</p>

  <p>"The nine Genuine Dragons' spirits... All of you are Mike's contractual beasts," Holy Drew said faintly, watching the nine Genuine Dragons' spirits. "Mike is known as the Holy Emperor of beasts in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Among the Holy Beings, he has the most contractual beasts. The Genuine Dragons are predominant among them and there are forty-nine Genuine Dragons in total. Do you want to restore your own body or devote your spirit to Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Mike loved feeding contractual beasts, especially dragons. Genuine Dragon World was constructed at one side of Evolutionary Universe while he was creating the whole place. This Genuine Dragon World was Mike's beast farm.</p>

  <p>In Holy Drew's opinion, the spirits of nine Genuine Dragons were good refinement materials for Luo Zheng. He knew that overall, it would be great help for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"We... Object," Five-clawed Golden Dragon uttered.</p>

  <p>The dragon's remarks attracted Holy Drew's curiosity. "Mike is your master. Why wouldn't you want to devote your spirits to his son?"</p>

  <p>"Something happened in Genuine Dragon World. They got our clansmen to abandon us. It's just not the right time for us to devote our spirits..."</p>

  <p>Five-clawed Golden Dragon replied.</p>

  <p>To divide the universe constructed by a Holy Being wasn't easy work.</p>

  <p>When the universe itself sensed crisis, it would devise to counterattack.</p>

  <p>Even if the Sacred race gained advantages in everything, breaking through to Evolutionary Universe wasn't that easy, because the Evolutionary Universe had its own consciousness and would establish an adverse environment.</p>

  <p>It was like when a troop invaded a country, everything, including the land, trees, grass and rivers, would fight back in silence.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had conspired for a long time and was well prepared for this invasion.</p>

  <p>Besides the ancient sorcerer race, the Demon Night and the ogre race were also acting suspiciously. Therefore, the Celestial Position didn't trust these two races. Genuine Dragon World had taken movement earlier. They had incited forty Genuine Dragons to rebel, while other nine Genuine Dragons had lost their own fleshly bodies.</p>

  <p>These nine Genuine Dragons were willing to help Luo Zheng, but they still had to avenge themselves in the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>Prior to such, it was only natural that they didn't want to sacrifice themselves.</p>
