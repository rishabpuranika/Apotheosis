<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The soul crystal was so precious, and one had to pay a huge price to get their hands on it.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't answer the question. Instead, he asked, "What kind of an opportunity are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>Konnor smiled as he said, "The Seven Mountains Meeting."</p>

  <p>"The Seven Mountains Meeting?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Konnor. "The Seven Mountains Meeting is held every three years. The elites of the seven mountains: the Oneness Mountain, Vastness Mountain, Bright Mountain, Azure Mountain, Ivory Mountain, Origin Mountain, and the Golden Mountain, will gather together in the event."</p>

  <p>After the Oneness Sky Palace had been established, there had been the famous "Seven Mountains Assembly" that had laid the foundation for the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>As the Oneness Sky Palace prospered, the elite disciples of the seven mountains began to imitate their predecessors and held a Seven Mountains Meeting. The meeting was originally meant for the most outstanding talents of the Oneness Sky Palace to gather together and communicate with each other.</p>

  <p>But as time passed, the content of the meetings became more diversified.</p>

  <p>The Seven Mountains Meeting later became an occasion for the outstanding talents to compete with each other.</p>

  <p>It was slowly but steadily garnering more and more attention from the leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace, who began to fully support the event every time it was held. The rewards were substantial.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace also took the Seven Mountains Meeting as an opportunity to distribute resources since a competition of this level could motivate the elites of each mountain.</p>

  <p>'They said so much just to persuade me to take part in the competition?' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>"You have already reached the eighth or ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm and are stronger than me. I'm afraid I won't be able to help if I participate in the Seven Mountains Meeting," Zheng said. He was sure that speaking his mind would be for the best.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have a low opinion of himself, but there were indeed some powerful warriors among these elites.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, listen to me. You don't know that event. The Seven Mountains Meeting is not a competition that's based merely on physical strength. It's a carefully designed game. If one wants to win, what's most important is one's mastery of the Truth of Godly Way," Konnor said.</p>

  <p>"The mastery of the Truth of Godly Way?" Zheng said, his eyebrows rising.</p>

  <p>Konnor nodded. "You are a talent who is capable of Instant Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>If you take part in the Seven Mountains Meeting, you will have an advantage. And then we will all gain some benefit from your success as well."</p>

  <p>"But if that's the case, isn't Milo more suitable to take part in the competition?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>If he were being honest, Zheng wasn't very interested in the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>"Milo?" A wry smile momentarily flashed across Konnor's face. "He attended it once before, but he chose to cultivate in seclusion and wander on the Other Shore recently. He might have felt threatened by you."</p>

  <p>Before Zheng had arrived in the Flow Sword Sect, Milo had proclaimed himself to be the top warrior in the sect. Even though his cultivation level was far inferior to that of others, no one had doubted his position.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's performance in the Flow Tower had proved his strength.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Milo had had a conflict with Zheng and he probably really felt the pressure to improve himself.</p>

  <p>The elite disciples were anxious to see Zheng looking disinterested. Mekhi hurriedly said, "There will be lots of rewards in the Seven Mountains Meeting. If you join and we win the competition, each of us will get one finger-size chunk of soul crystal. We can give half our share to you, which you can use to increase the power of your Soul of Light by a large extent."</p>

  <p>"We can also win an Other Shore Treasure!" Konnor added.</p>

  <p>Despite the arguments they were making, Zheng still looked unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"And it is said that Master Goran will take out a premium Other Shore Treasure personally as a reward for the champion this year! It's the Shade Phoenix Sword, a sword made by the Su Clan. It is said to have been cast with a Shade Stone excavated from the Bloom Divine Province."</p>

  <p>Zheng was trying to find a way to refuse their invitation but his eyes lit up at the mention of the premium Other Shore Treasure being cast with the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone!</p>

  <p>The Strength God Totem that Zheng had obtained could unleash an Other Shore Power of 1200 divine megatons. But he couldn't unleash the full power using his physical body.</p>

  <p>He had previously been troubled because he didn't know how to find more Shade Stones to strengthen himself.</p>

  <p>But he also hadn't expected to find a way. Now, of all times!</p>

  <p>Since the Shade Phoenix Sword was refined by the Shade Stone, he should be able to transform it into Shade Stone liquid.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't do that, but the Su Clan could.</p>

  <p>At the sudden change in Zheng's expression, Konnor and others brightened.</p>

  <p>"It looks like you are interested in the Shade Phoenix Sword."</p>

  <p>But they didn't know that Zheng actually wanted to smelt the premium Other Shore Treasure.</p>

  <p>Zheng deflected the unasked question and said, "I wonder when the Seven Mountains Meeting will begin."</p>

  <p>"Five days from now," said Konnor.</p>

  <p>"I will go with you then," Zheng said, folding his hands towards them in respect.</p>

  <p>The elite disciples were overjoyed at Zheng's acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"The probability of our Flow Sword Sect winning the competition will increase greatly if you join us!"</p>

  <p>"But we still need to be prepared, because we are not the only force that has a warrior who is capable of Instant Enlightenment."</p>

  <p>"We'd be sure to win if Milo and Zheng both participated. But unfortunately..."</p>

  <p>They had originally wanted to persuade Milo to join them, but Milo had chosen to cultivate in seclusion and did not show up. Konnor had even gone to the Other Shore for this. But all his efforts had been in vain.</p>

  <p>When Zheng went back to his own house, he found that Trish had repaired the crack on the second floor.</p>

  <p>As he sat in his room, Zheng contemplated the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>'The Seven Mountains Meeting... is a carefully designed game?</p>

  <p>And this game has something to do with the Truth of Godly Way?</p>

  <p>They wanted me to join because I could comprehend the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent with Instant Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>I'm determined to get the Shade Phoenix Sword!'</p>

  <p>But the Oneness Sky Palace was not a place that the small Sword Light Palace could compare to.</p>

  <p>A powerful warrior like Milo existed in a sect like the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Zheng was afraid that the other mountains had warriors who were superior to Milo.</p>

  <p>At this thought, Zheng waved his hands and condensed a layer of enchanted barrier. He then opened his palms and a piece of paper spread out before him.</p>

  <p>On the paper was the content that had been deciphered from the Sanskrit words on the yellow paper.</p>

  <p>He hadn't studied it after Geoffrey had deciphered the two Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, he had been focused on practicing Flow Strike, and on the other hand, the content was too difficult to comprehend.</p>

  <p>Zheng must be prepared, since he was determined to get the Shade Phoenix Sword.</p>

  <p>His gaze was focused on the paper before he started to recite according to the rule he found within the paper's content.</p>

  <p>Similar to what Geoffrey had encountered when he had recited the words, Zheng felt a beam of sharp sword radiance forming in his mind when he began to recite. The sword radiance surged up and rushed to penetrate his soul and skull.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's Soul of Light was many times stronger than Geoffrey's.</p>

  <p>He managed to suppress the sharp sword radiance in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Did this sword radiance appear because of the thought in my mind?"</p>

  <p>When he studied the content that had been deciphered from the Sanskrit words, Zheng suddenly found that it was similar to the Heart Slaughtering Strike that was recorded in the Flow Swordsmanship.</p>
