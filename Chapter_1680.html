  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1680 The Fate Of The Eleven (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just by looking at these eleven warriors, the Thoughtless Minds had proven to the entire universe that they were the force with the greatest potentials.</p>

  <p>Amongst the eleven warriors were Lawson, Nathan, Lucille, and Tianming.</p>

  <p>The first three were direct descendants of the big clans of the Thoughtless Minds. Tianming, on the other hand, had ascended to the region of the Thoughtless Minds, thus making him a legitimate member of the said force.</p>

  <p>In other words, the Thoughtless Minds had obtained four seats out of the eleven, outnumbering the other forces.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night, the ogres, and the Blessed Buddha Land each had obtained the only seat in the top eleven.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Humanity Alliance had almost failed to make it to this round.</p>

  <p>The only Godly Genius from the Humanity Alliance who had made it into the top 300 was easily defeated by Lawson from the Thoughtless Minds. Therefore, he was eliminated and didn't make it to the top eleven.</p>

  <p>The Humanity Alliance was nearly off this game!</p>

  <p>Luckily, there was Zheng. Before the Illusion Battlefield had begun, Zheng had ascended to one sacred place of the Humanity Alliance. Thus, he was considered a legitimate member of the alliance. He was now the last hope of the Humanity Alliance in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Right now, the situation on the board had become quite complicated.</p>

  <p>The tables had turned— the long line of white stones was cut off, giving the black stones the greatest advantage. Now, the black stones had successfully separated the territories the white stones had occupied.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords had hearts in their mouths with the sudden turn of events. They were like cats on hot bricks.</p>

  <p>This game of Go symbolized the evolution of this grand era— the past, present, and future. In the beginning, the white stones' triumphs demonstrated the early years of this grand era up to the prosperity of the human race. This was the past.</p>

  <p>Then, the disruption of the long line of white stones represented the fierce clash between the different forces. This was the present.</p>

  <p>Now, the unexpected takeover of the black stones implied the turbulent future.</p>

  <p>The white stones represented the stability of this grand era. So, the disruption of the white stones could be a prophecy of a massive crisis that was bound to happen in the future.</p>

  <p>And judging by the current situation on the board, the Supreme Lords predicted that most of the races, including the greatest ones, would perish because of the crisis.</p>

  <p>If the prophecy would happen, the universe could lose trillions of its population in an instant.</p>

  <p>That could be the most disheartening situation to think about.</p>

  <p>But since the game on the Heaven Earth Board was still on going, the situation could either still improve or worsen. If the white stones would get wiped out, it was very likely that all lives in the entire universe would perish, and this grand era would meet its end.</p>

  <p>It was indeed that the fate of the universe, no matter how hard it was to comprehend, was already decided by the heavens.</p>

  <p id="top_12">Even the Supreme Lords felt powerless to change the seemingly inevitable chaotic future.</p>

  <p>But if they couldn't do it, they rested their hopes in the protagonists in the world of chaos. They were told to be the strongest in the entire universe and the only people who could have the ability to change the fate of this grand era.</p>

  <p>But this theory was only of the ordinary Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of different ranks had different opinions and theories about everything.</p>

  <p>Unlike the ordinary Supreme Lords, the top-rank Supreme Lords had different views about the fate of the entire universe.</p>

  <p>The head of the Celestial Position race and Supreme Lord of Original Sin were some of these top-rank Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Even though they weren't born in times of chaos, people could not argue with their profound thoughts and insights on more complicated matters.</p>

  <p>These people were the few of the unrivaled geniuses in the entire universe in this grand era.</p>

  <p>Now, all creatures had always wondered about two things: Was it impossible to change their destinies designed by the heavens?</p>

  <p>Could there be a way for the Supreme Lords to break their Heavenly Destinies and become a True God?</p>

  <p>The entire universe strongly believed that the rules of the heavens were carved in stone. However, for the top-rank Supreme Lords, they were convinced that rules were bound to be broken. If one had a strong understanding of a certain rule, then he would surely know a way to go around it. But to interpret the rules designed by the heavens, they must first uncover the secrets of how the world began.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the eleven warriors on the Heaven Earth Board were quietly waiting for the huge hand to appear in the sky and make the next moves.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for the hand to appear through the thick layer of clouds. The warriors kept their eyes locked on the hand as it slowly reached for a black stone. Everything and everyone went completely silent, even those watching from outside the Illusion Battlefield. The warriors were holding their breaths as they waited for the hand to choose one of them... and it was Margaret!</p>

  <p>Snap!</p>

  <p>The stone that Margaret was on was then placed on the board.</p>

  <p>At this point, the game had reached its most crucial part where every move mattered. One wrong move and it would be game over!</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, Margaret's stone was placed at a corner that didn't make sense to the territories of both sides.</p>

  <p>Everyone was left stunned by the last move.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't understand why the hand made a meaningless move with the black stone.</p>

  <p>Margaret herself was dumbfounded by the move. She was a Go master herself; thus, she immediately recognized that the move was inappropriate.</p>

  <p>The hand then made its move in the white stones.</p>

  <p>And this time, it was Nathan from the Thoughtless Minds!</p>

  <p>Anyone would normally feel unlucky and upset if they were to face Nathan in a battle.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, they considered Margaret as lucky.</p>

  <p>This was because they noticed that the white stone was also placed at a rather strange spot.</p>

  <p>The spots they were placed in were not strategic. And since no stone was pulled out from the game with these two moves, neither Margaret nor Nathan would be eliminated. They could choose not to fight, and admit defeat directly.</p>
