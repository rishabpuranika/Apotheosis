<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The competition in the Illusion Battlefield was quite intense.</p>

  <p>Since there were many main cities in the Illusion Battlefield and the majority of the martial artists could only move in a certain area, it was impossible for them to pass through many main cities in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the vast majority of warriors attacked and killed others to get Illusion Points around a main city.</p>

  <p>Of course, everyone had different ways to get Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Lucille, for example, took control of a main city and collected Illusion Points like she was collecting tax. All the warriors in the city had to pay "taxes" and no one could escape.</p>

  <p>Of course, if she had collected Illusion Points merely by taking up a city, it would have been impossible for her to reach such a high ranking.</p>

  <p>However, Lucille practiced One Soul in Two Bodies. Her duplicate form, Lucy, was wandering around in another supreme world to gather Illusion Points there.</p>

  <p>The number of Illusion Points Lucy obtained was also recorded under Lucille's name.</p>

  <p>This was the main reason why Lucille had been able to take the lead and be ranked seventh in the pyramid. It was such a great feat that the entire Ji Clan felt proud of her.</p>

  <p>After all, in the Thoughtless Minds, only two people had managed to fight their way into the top ten. One was Nathan, who had been ranked first before, while the other was Lucille. After Nathan's ranking had dropped for no reason, Lucille was the only martial artist from the Thoughtless Minds who had entered the top ten.</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan's patriarch was also quite happy when he saw this. He repeatedly exclaimed that the Ji Clan finally had a worthy successor.</p>

  <p>However, at this very moment, Lucille's ranking rapidly dropped! It dropped all the way from the 7th to 700th!</p>

  <p>The master of the Ji Clan stared fixedly at the names on the pyramid with a grim expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"Someone has killed Lucille once!" the master of the Ji Clan said coldly.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, people outside the Illusion Battlefield were not able to observe what was happening inside. All they could do was to wonder who had the strength to kill the ace talent of the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, the person that has defeated Lucille wouldn't be a nobody. I wonder what gave the person the courage to provoke my niece!" one of the elders of the Ji Clan said with a stern voice. Big clans were usually domineering. In the Ji Clan, Lucille was the apple of everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>How could they tolerate someone attacking her and killing her?</p>

  <p>"As I said before, we should have let Lucille merge with Lucy. One Soul in Two Bodies would greatly reduce her strength. Why take the trouble of using such a method!?" another elder said angrily.</p>

  <p>Being a duplicate of Lucille, Lucy had extraordinary power as well. The key point was that only when the two fused together could Lucille unleash her full power.</p>

  <p>Before the Illusion Battlefield opened, there had been a dispute among the Ji Clan about whether or not the two should fuse with each other.</p>

  <p>There were advantages of them merging. With Lucille in her complete form, there were very few opponents in the Illusion Battlefield who would be able to fight against her. She even had the ability to fight against Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But if Lucile entered the Illusion Battlefield with two separate forms, the speed at which she could earn Illusion Points would double. The only drawback was that the strength of each of her forms would be half of that of her complete form.</p>

  <p>In the end, the one who had made the decision was Lucille herself.</p>

  <p>In truth, entering the Illusion Battlefield with a duplicate was a big advantage for her.</p>

  <p>For instance, this time, when Lucille was killed by Zheng, if she was like any other ordinary warrior, she would have lost half of her Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>But now, Lucille had only lost half of the Illusion Points of her main body. Her duplicate body, Lucy, hadn't lost anything. So in total, she had only lost a quarter of her Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>If Lucille was killed once when she was in her complete form, her ranking would not just fall to the 700th, it would fall directly below the 2000th!</p>

  <p>However, how many people could kill Lucille when she was in her complete form?</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield had 50 supreme worlds, and the number of warriors that might be able to defeat Lucille was only a dozen.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these warriors might not be in the same supreme world as Lucille, which meant that the chances of her being killed were very small.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there was no definite answer to which way was better. Both had their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

  <p>Now, the elders of the Ji Clan started to argue again about this.</p>

  <p>"All right...''</p>

  <p>The patriarch of the Ji Clan, who was sitting at the highest point, waved his hand.</p>

  <p>When his voice rang out, the entire Ji Clan became extremely quiet.</p>

  <p>Even the master of the clan and the other elders sat up straight.</p>

  <p>"Lucille is doing great. Besides, being killed once doesn't matter much. I believe she will rise in her ranking once again," said the patriarch indifferently.</p>

  <p>"The patriarch is right, we should have some confidence in Lucille. And maybe she wasn't even killed. Logically speaking, there should be some treasure troves in the Illusion Battlefield. She might have encountered some unavoidable danger there. Anyway, warriors that die in the Illusion Battlefield can be revived, so Lucille still has a lot of chances to rise in her ranking," the master of the Ji Clan said calmly.</p>

  <p>Quite a number of the people present nodded their heads upon hearing this.</p>

  <p>The rankings in the early stages of the competition didn't mean anything.</p>

  <p>The name of Nathan, who had been leading the way, had already disappeared from the pyramid without a trace. Now that he was quickly catching up, everyone had to be patient with Lucille.</p>

  <p>In another corner of the Illusion Battlefield, a female warrior with a saber in her hand was standing at the top of the city wall with her head tilted.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this warrior was exactly the same as Lucille's.</p>

  <p>However, their auras were completely different.</p>

  <p>There were always white snowflakes floating around Lucille. This woman had snowflakes around her, too. However, these snowflakes were black in color.</p>

  <p>Although she and Lucille were two bodies of a soul, Lucy had her own mind and thoughts. Even her personality was completely different from Lucille's.</p>

  <p>The martial artists of this main city… had almost escaped…</p>

  <p>After the opening of the Illusion Battlefield, Lucy had relied on a single saber to mercilessly slaughter the martial artists of this main city.</p>

  <p>She did not care about how many Illusion Points her opponents possessed or how many benefits she would reap. Every time she saw warriors outside the city, she sent them back to the main city with her single saber!</p>

  <p>After a period of time, many martial artists gathered in the main city, no longer daring to come out.</p>

  <p>But staying in the city all the time wasn't a solution. After some discussion, they decided to escape at the same time.</p>

  <p>Lucy was indeed extremely powerful, but it was impossible for her to capture all of the martial artists in one go. They just flocked out and tried their best to escape with the idea that eventually, some of them would succeed.</p>

  <p>As they ran, Lucy killed a large number of them. However, most of them managed to escape the city. So overall, the Illusion Points she accumulated were not as many as Lucille's.</p>

  <p>But Lucy didn't care.</p>

  <p>Even though they were two bodies of one soul, there was a primary body and a secondary body. Lucille was the primary. As the secondary, Lucy only needed to kill to her heart's content and didn't need to worry about other matters.</p>

  <p>Right now, most of the main city's martial artists had fled or scattered away. The remaining martial artists were the ones who couldn't escape, and their Illusion Points had already been drained by Lucy. Therefore, she was planning to go to another main city.</p>

  <p>When the martial artists in the main city saw Lucy preparing to leave, they were secretly relieved. The sooner this plague left, the better!</p>

  <p>But just before she left, Lucy discovered that her ranking had started to drop drastically.</p>

  <p>"Who... Who killed me?"</p>

  <p>Lucy closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>She could connect to Lucille through telepathic communication. After a moment, Lucy had the answer to her question.</p>

  <p>'A warrior called Tianxing Luo…</p>

  <p>If I want to find this guy, I'll probably have to cross supreme worlds. I'm currently unable to do it.</p>

  <p>However, with the strength this guy possesses, I'll eventually encounter him.'</p>

  <p>As she thought of this, her blurry eyes lit up with a clear ray of light.</p>

  <p>In another main city, a human figure slowly emerged from a green ball of light.</p>

  <p>It was Lucille, who had been killed by Zheng. She was reviving very quickly.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the ball of light broke into pieces and Lucille appeared from within. She looked in the direction of the main city's exit with a depressed look in her clear eyes.</p>

  <p>"Young master!"</p>

  <p>"Young master!"</p>

  <p>Norton and Ethan had been waiting for a long time beside the green sphere of light.</p>

  <p>Back when Norton was defeated by Zheng, he had initially been unwilling to accept it. But now, after seeing that even Lucille had been defeated by that guy, he realized that there was a huge gap between him and Zheng in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>Lucille gave a slight nod before walking toward the city gate.</p>

  <p>On top of the city wall, all the martial artists looked at Zheng with awe in their eyes.</p>

  <p>This kid had really done it. He had killed Lucile, the ace talent of the Ji Clan!</p>

  <p>In the eyes of these Soul Sea Realm warriors who had resigned to their fate, it was simply incomprehensible to them that a Soul Sea Realm warrior could kill Lucille.</p>

  <p>After all, Lucille was an undefeatable legend. No one in the main city could become her match, let alone kill her.</p>

  <p>And yet, Zheng had done it.</p>
