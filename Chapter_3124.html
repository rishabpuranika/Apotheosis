<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3124 Return To The Dragon City </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The setting sun shone on the Grand River Fortress.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Taiyi Guards were surprised as they watched Qiu Yinhe bring Luo Zheng back.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe seldom went to the Grand River Fortress, but he had placed the Lofty Swords in the fortress, one by one.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe planned to take Luo Zheng straight back to the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng insisted on waiting here for Gant.</p>

  <p>Gant managed to escape from Phoenix, and as long as he was careful on his way back, there should be no big problem.</p>

  <p>When they were under attack in the Blue Cloud City, the Grand River Fortress had immediately sent reinforcements to help them.</p>

  <p>But the Jin Wu had blocked the first group of reinforcements. They had then sent in the second group.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards who had fought the Jin Wu out on the plain held on long enough and finally got help from the second group of reinforcements. But a majority of them were dead or wounded.</p>

  <p>Sebert had died, and Satchel had gotten seriously injured while fighting with another demon woman of the Divine Lair. But he succeeded in killing her.</p>

  <p>When the second group of reinforcements and the rest of the Taiyi Guards were on the way back, they met Gant, who was carrying Eira on his back.</p>

  <p>So Gant followed the reinforcements back to the Grand River Fortress.</p>

  <p>For the past two days, Gant was worrying himself sick over Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In order to declare his loyalty to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Gant's father, Cailen, led the elders of the Su Clan to place their Rebirth Lands in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Most pill refiners and weapon refiners who relied on super forces would do that.</p>

  <p>This way, they could be revived even if they died.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng hadn't joined the Taiyi Guards, and he didn't have a Rebirth Land. How could he survive an attack from Phoenix?</p>

  <p>Gant was depressed as they made their way to the Grand River Fortress.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that he would see Luo Zheng the moment he returned to the fortress.</p>

  <p>Gant's eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master! How did you survive?" Gant asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Did you want me to die?" Luo Zheng asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>Gant shook his head vigorously as he said, "Of course not! I don't want you to die! Obviously not!"</p>

  <p>"Gant, is this the Flag Master you mentioned?" Eira's weak voice sounded from behind Gant.</p>

  <p>Gant had run away, carrying Eira on his back, and she had woken soon after.</p>

  <p>She was shocked when she saw Gant. It was hard for her to imagine that Gant would leave the Dragon City to help her. It was difficult for a warrior who had just reached the Other Shore Realm to do something like this.</p>

  <p>Gant told Eira everything that had happened in the Blue Cloud City after she had fainted. Only then did she realize how dangerous the situation was and that she was fortunate to have survived, even in the worst of it all.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Gant kept talking about Luo Zheng, piquing Eira's interest and curiosity about this Flag Master.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is my Flag Master!"</p>

  <p>Gant said, excited. He then went on to unabashedly praise Luo Zheng, causing Luo Zheng to blush at his remarks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng interrupted him, but when Gant stopped talking about it, he brought up another one. He still wanted to know how Luo Zheng had escaped.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng would not reveal anything about the Latent Theurgies. Now that Gant had arrived at the Grand River Fortress, it was time for them to go back.</p>

  <p>He then found Qiu Yinhe in the fortress and explained to Gant, "It was Master Qiu Yinhe who saved my life. I would not be standing here today if it weren't for him."</p>

  <p>"Master Qiu Yinhe."</p>

  <p>Gant didn't have a high cultivation base, but he was highly knowledgeable.</p>

  <p>He knew that Qiu Yinhe was a Taiyi Governor.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe treated Luo Zheng in a friendly way, but remained indifferent to others.</p>

  <p>The five-star Taiyi Guards in the fortress respected him, but Qiu Yinhe always ignored them.</p>

  <p>"Now that the person you were waiting for has arrived, I will send you back," said Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," Luo Zheng said, folding his hands in respect.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe then escorted Luo Zheng, Gant, and Eira back to the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Once they returned, Gant bid goodbye to Luo Zheng and left, since he had to see Eira home.</p>

  <p>Before he left, he asked Luo Zheng for the Snow Sword. Since this sword was made by the Su Clan, he wanted to take this opportunity to repair it for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe handed a golden Sword Card to Luo Zheng. "I know you have a lot of things to deal with inside the Dragon City. They are just minor issues. You don't belong to the Dragon City. Please go to the Taiyi Mountain and look for me as soon as possible. I want to impart you something."</p>

  <p>After saying these words, Qiu Yinhe disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Dragon City hadn't changed much during the time that Luo Zheng was out.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Mountain Viewing Province where battles took place all the time, the Dragon City was much quieter and more peaceful.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found Beldene and was surprised to find that his subordinates had increased in number. There were almost two thousand members now!</p>

  <p>The cultivation bases of the disciples from the Sword Light Palace had also increased steadily.</p>

  <p>They were happy at Luo Zheng's return. Faegan spoke, "Flag Master, you have accumulated merit points and we have enough members now. I think you are qualified to be promoted to the Alliance Chief."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was touched at the love, admiration, and happiness radiating from their faces.</p>

  <p>These disciples had stayed with him through thick and thin. But he knew that he might have to leave the Dragon City soon. He wasn't prepared to be parted with them so soon!</p>

  <p>But even if he went to the Taiyi Mountain, Luo Zheng would treat these disciples well.</p>

  <p>Milo could make the Sword-reading Liquid to sell at the foot of the mountain, and so could Luo Zheng. The profit alone could guarantee the cultivation resources of the disciples.</p>

  <p>Beldene filled Luo Zheng in about the monthly revenue and expenditure of the past days. He was a responsible man and recorded the accounts clearly.</p>

  <p>It was the high season of recruitment in the Dragon City. The demand for Sword-reading Liquid was huge, and the income, abundant. More than 90% of the Sword-reading Liquid had been sold.</p>

  <p>The remaining bottles of Sword-reading Liquid had been kept until now because Beldene hadn't wanted to sell them before. And right now, the current price of the Sword-reading Liquid could shoot up to 30, 000 divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng carried a lot of divine crystals with him and thought of the Truth Library.</p>

  <p>He had always been interested in the manual of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but it was expensive; it cost about ten million divine crystals. The price was too high for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had a stable income selling the Sword-reading Liquid, he could easily afford ten million divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, upon entering Dragon City, went straight to the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe hadn't been interested in the Shade Stone. Luo Zheng was forced to think about it because it had been sucked into his physical body. However, he quelled his curiosity since it was inconvenient to check on it on the way.</p>

  <p>In the practicing room of the Sword Tower, Luo Zheng took off his clothes and released his spiritual sense to inspect the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone turned into a small black dot on his back. It began to spread and in only a few days, had covered half of his back.</p>
