<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A shadow figure was dashing wildly through the Sky Forest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had raised his speed to maximum.</p>

  <p>He concentrated the power of dragon scales into his legs and started to run like crazy.</p>

  <p>With the immense power in feet, Luo Zheng tramped the soft soil into pieces and left a big hole like it was bombed. He ran so fast that his feet seemed like they were not touching the ground and made a whooshing sound as he dashed through the forest.</p>

  <p>At his speed, he would sometimes bump into trees or break branches along the way.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng could not stop at any moment because even with that speed, he still couldn't catch up with the demon general. He could go faster, but then the demon general would just double his speed, leaving Luo Zheng with a greater distance to catch up for.</p>

  <p>At first, when he started chasing the demon general and Nina, he could still see them at a distance.</p>

  <p>But now, he could only see the figure of the demon general.</p>

  <p>Both human and the demon general were running at a high speed.</p>

  <p>If they ran at a normal speed, Luo Zheng and the demon general could keep running for one to two months. It was evident that the warrior and the demon general had surpassed the limit of life.</p>

  <p>But they were not just playing around, instead, they were going at a high speed that no normal person could do.</p>

  <p>And after running for an hour or two, the demon general gradually slowed down.</p>

  <p>Even the demon general who was known for his endurance and toughness couldn't keep up with that speed without resting in between.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng's physical state was better than that of the demon general.</p>

  <p>His strength was extracted from the scales of the cyan dragon embedded in his mind. Every time Zheng's physical strength was used up, the dragon scales would light up and regenerate his strength to full capacity.</p>

  <p>But the green light would eventually dim once the dragon scale power was already used up.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the power of the dragon scale had its limits and it would eventually dry out if used too much.</p>

  <p>'The demon general is slowing down. I think he won't last that long, ' Luo Zheng said to himself. But he didn't falter from running but instead kept his speed so he could catch up to the demon general and save Nina.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the demon general also felt helpless and got anxious with the human catching up to him.</p>

  <p>The demons naturally had greater body strength and endurance than humans.</p>

  <p>Thus, the demon general underestimated the human chasing him and thought that he couldn't possibly outrun him.</p>

  <p>At the start of their rat chase, the human was running a little slow and the demon general almost lost him. But suddenly, the human caught up to him and he was running at a crazy speed. It was as if the human had unlocked some sort of art to muster that kind of speed.</p>

  <p>The demon general wasn't at all surprised. This human bloke already killed a fellow demon general which no normal human could've ever done. There was more to this human bloke than meet the eye and he could still have some hidden strength in his body.</p>

  <p>But everything had its limits. This bloke was only half-step into the nature level so there was no way he could catch up to him even if he slowed down.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a demon general and a half-step into nature level human could not possibly keep up with him.</p>

  <p>The human didn't even have a life vitality, only life energy from his body. And from the demon general's experience, someone like this could be killed without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>Despite all the demon general's rational thinking, it still didn't make sense to him.</p>

  <p>He wanted to stop and put an end to the human bloke's life.</p>

  <p>But the thought that the same human killed another demon general made him think twice.</p>

  <p>The demon general needed help to defeat this human. So, on his way trying to lose Luo Zheng from his trail, the demon general sent out a signal to the other demon generals through his evil spirit. If reinforcement came, it would be easy for them to kill the human bloke.</p>

  <p>Slowing down a little, the demon general regained some strength and continued running.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that the demon general was a more dangerous foe than the one he had just killed. But despite the threat, he had to save Nina no matter the cost.</p>

  <p>As he got closer to the demon general, Luo Zheng moved his fingers and the broken flying knife fell on his hand.</p>

  <p>He shot the broken flying knife at the demon general.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Combining Zheng's speed and the force of his shot, the broken flying knife cut through the air and made a massive zing.</p>

  <p>When the demon general heard the unfamiliar sound, he looked back to see what it was. The broken flying blade was approaching him at a speed of light. The demon general sneered and shook his shoulders. A bone spike appeared on his shoulder and shot back at the broken flying blade.</p>

  <p>The demon general could use the bone spike to change the course of the broken flying blade by attacking it on its side.</p>

  <p>But not knowing the power of the broken flying blade, the demon general planned to stop it head-on with his bone spike.</p>

  <p>When the bone spike clashed with the broken flying blade, something inconceivable happened.</p>

  <p>The bone spike was cut into halves. Its hardness and strength that was almost equal to a spiritual weapon had no match with the force of the broken flying blade.</p>

  <p>The impact didn't slow down nor stop the blade and it continued to fly towards the demon general. It was fast approaching, and there was no time to summon another bone spike.</p>

  <p>The demon general abruptly ducked and rolled to the ground to avoid the broken flying blade.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng caught up behind the demon general. He jumped and clapped his hands and purple demonic life energy started to accumulate. He then slammed the demon general with all his might.</p>

  <p>The demon general found himself in a difficult situation.</p>

  <p>Anticipating Zheng's attack, the demon general didn't dare to fight back face-to-face. Instead, he rolled on the ground to avoid Zheng's wrath. He picked up the unconscious Nina from the ground and commenced running.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hit the soil instead of the demon general's face.</p>

  <p>It created a big and deep crater on the ground.</p>

  <p>The power of the Heavenly Ogre Fist overwhelmed Luo Zheng, but there was no time to be astonished.</p>

  <p>He pulled out his fist from the ground and touched the iron ring with his thumb. Suddenly, the broken flying blade flew back to his hand. Once he had secured the blade, he ran after the demon general again.</p>

  <p>Learning Zheng's ability, the demon general was on heightened alert.</p>

  <p>Now, every time Luo Zheng shot the broken flying knife to him, he would direct his bone spikes to hit the spruces on both sides. Each spruce was as wide as a person and it could change the direction of the blade once it crashed it.</p>

  <p>So Luo Zheng tried to shoot the broken flying blade several times at different directions but made no good result.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng and the demon general were back to their run and chase.</p>

  <p>But it didn't last long.</p>

  <p>The demon general finally stopped running and turned to Luo Zheng. He stared at him with his weird eyes and a harsh voice came out of his mouth,</p>

  <p>"Human, are you having fun chasing me?"</p>

  <p>"Hoop..."</p>

  <p>The broken flying blade spun and cut off the two spruce trunks before finally returning to Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng caught the flying blade and said coldly, "Put her down and I will let you go."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's not going to happen. This woman's machine is interesting, and I must take her away," The demon general proudly replied.</p>

  <p>"Then, I can't let you go." Luo Zheng pointed the broke flying blade to the demon general and lowered it down. Like a cheetah, Luo Zheng lunged forward to the prey with all his saved up strength.</p>

  <p>The demon general laughed hysterically, "Really? We don't know for sure who will come out of here alive."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng sensed something strange around him. Evil spirits appeared at the same time.</p>

  <p>Three demon generals?</p>

  <p>No! Five!</p>

  <p>There were now six demon generals with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face turned serious. It was not a joke to face six demon generals on his own.</p>

  <p>With his current state, Luo Zheng could take on one demon general by himself.</p>

  <p>Two demon generals would still be manageable for him.</p>

  <p>But beyond three demon generals, Zheng's chance of survival would be greater if he would just run for his life.</p>

  <p>But with six demon generals, there was no time to run.</p>

  <p>"Gee!" The demon general who took Nina let out a strange laugh. But despite the distorted look, Luo Zheng could still see that he was satisfied with the turn of events.</p>

  <p>"Gee..."</p>

  <p>The demon generals laughed all together.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was surrounded by the demon generals.</p>

  <p>He had experienced many life and death situations before.</p>

  <p>Under such a predicament, Luo Zheng knew that it was best to stay calm so he could think rationally.</p>

  <p>He needed to save Nina even if it meant risking his life.</p>

  <p>Even if he died, there would be no regrets.</p>

  <p>"Poof."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng threw the broken flying blade to the ground and with great force, it went deep into the soil. He looked at the demon general in front of him and smiled slyly.</p>

  <p>Seeing the expression on Zheng's face, the demon general looked confused.</p>

  <p>He thought that the human bloke went crazy. How could the human still smile under the situation? He intentionally threw his only weapon into the ground. What was that kid planning?</p>

  <p>"Gee, play whatever trick you want. But you will never escape your destiny. Your flesh is fresh and delicious," That demon said and licked his upper lip like a maniac. Then the demon general raised his arms and waved. The demon generals surrounded Luo Zheng, ready to attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't listen to any of the demon general's crap. He knew they weren't human, and it was meaningless to communicate with them.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands horizontally and his body started to rotate.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng rotated, the broke flying blade was buried deeper to the ground and rotated continuously.</p>
