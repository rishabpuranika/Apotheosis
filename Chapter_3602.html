<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In reality, the white mist was only a huge illusion.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng began to long for the Eye of Will. After all, even if the Eye of Will's power wasn't that strong, the theurgy it had was very useful.</p>

  <p>The Authentic Visual World could help him see through almost all illusions, but unfortunately it was burnt when Zheng had fought the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The second he stopped moving, the white mist behind him surged forward.</p>

  <p>The white mist swirled until it formed the shape of a human being. The human-like mist held a large saber in one hand, and hacked towards Zheng's head!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>The white mist had appeared so suddenly that when Zheng realized what happened, the saber was already way too close to him.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, he subconsciously reached out his hand to protect himself.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The saber's power formed from the white mist was quite sharp. He felt the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body shake violently when it struck his arm, and the impact had caused half of his Chaotic Source Spirits to be consumed!</p>

  <p>"So powerful!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>In turn, he flew backwards with his arms around Feng Ge and kicked the human-shaped mist.</p>

  <p>He thought that since the human-shaped mist could execute such a strong saber strike, it must be extraordinarily powerful. He didn't expect that his light kick would cause the human-shaped mist to disperse.</p>

  <p>'This is bad!' he thought.</p>

  <p>His thunder wings flapped once more, and then he flew half a foot upward.</p>

  <p>The human-shaped mist attacked from the other side this time. Luckily, Zheng was quick to react, managing to dodge. If the saber hit him again, the Chaotic Source Spirits would most likely get exhausted once more.</p>

  <p>When he avoided the second strike, Feng Ge also seized the opportunity and quickly grabbed the human-shaped white mist.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the human-shaped white mist was destroyed.</p>

  <p>The moment the human-shaped mist dissipated, Feng Ge immediately yelled,</p>

  <p>"Zheng, up there!"</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had no time to analyze the situation, he just blindly grabbed above him and crushed the mist once again. But just as the mist dispersed, it escaped from behind!</p>

  <p>"Clatter, clatter, clatter..."</p>

  <p>The human-shaped white mist with the saber repeatedly appeared and disappeared, but Zheng and Feng Ge didn't stop at all even though they could not communicate.</p>

  <p>About five minutes later, the white mist finally disappeared.</p>

  <p>Both of them gasped for breath. They had consumed a lot of their physical strengths in their last fight.</p>

  <p>"Completely defeated?" Feng Ge asked. "I'm not sure," Zheng said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, another three human-shaped mists appeared around them.</p>

  <p>Each of them had a different weapon— one had a sword, the other held an axe, and the last one wielded a spear.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing them, Feng Ge couldn't help but panic on the inside.</p>

  <p>One human-shaped mist had already made Zheng exhausted. Now, three of them would surely cause him great trouble!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng's eyes slightly narrowed into slits as he gently held Feng Ge up. In only a few seconds, his body changed and quickly grew two more heads and four more arms!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The three human-shaped white mists finally pounced towards him. It was true that they were strong and fierce, but their bodies were immediately destroyed the moment he touched them.</p>

  <p>Once he had understood their situation, he ignored their weapons and wrecked their bodies before they attacked him!</p>

  <p>His three heads could see and hear attacks from any direction. To be honest, he had an easier time dealing with the three human-shaped mists now compared to the single human-shaped mist earlier.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, the three human-shaped white mists disappeared again.</p>

  <p>But before he could sigh in relief, another nine human-shaped mists appeared!</p>

  <p>Just like before, all of them held different weapons, such as saber, spear, sword, halberd, axe, and so on.</p>

  <p>After he had observed all the weapons in their hands, he thought for a while first.</p>

  <p>He thought of the illusion that the Snake Goddess had shown him.</p>

  <p>His grandfather, also a member of the human race, was known as the Lord of Weapons, and created the Nine Li race. Therefore, the weapons the human-shaped mists wielded should have also come from the memories of the 77th civilization, which was the human race.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the temple nearby was indeed related to the human race!</p>

  <p>When the nine human-shaped mists appeared, Zheng felt the pressure on him increase suddenly.</p>

  <p>As for Feng Ge, she couldn't help much in fighting the fast and dense attacks.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>An axe was swung out from one side and hit Zheng's arm!</p>

  <p>In return, the Chaotic Source Spirits surged forth, while the Truth of Godly Way quickly began to repair them.</p>

  <p>When the Chaotic Source Spirits had just recovered up to eighty percent, a sharp arrow formed from the white mist flew towards him. The Chaotic Source Spirits took the blow once again, and now only thirty percent of their strength was left.</p>

  <p>Before the Truth of Godly Way could repair them, another large hammer came down at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>When the hammer crashed down, his Chaotic Source Spirits were finally worn out. He had only sensed a white light flash at him, which felt like five bolts of lightning had struck him!</p>

  <p>Even so, he gritted his teeth and avoided the attack of the other human-shaped mists. However, his body trembled and he felt a little weak!</p>

  <p>"Zheng, let go of me!"</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge watched Zheng fight, she decided that she wanted to break free from his grip.</p>

  <p>Yet, she couldn't fly. Not only was she useless, but she was also a hindrance to Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng clearly knew that if he let go of her and let her fight the white mists alone, she would probably die. How could he listen to her request?</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>He flew and left the area, but several human-shaped white mists followed closely like ghosts. Their attacks were unstoppable!</p>

  <p>In that case, he could no longer dodge.</p>

  <p>Just as the weapons were about to hit him, a red fist mark appeared on the body of each human-shaped white mist.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop..."</p>

  <p>The fist marks exploded, and then the human-shaped white mists that surrounded him simultaneously dissipated.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to completely kill these human-shaped white mists.</p>

  <p>The first time Zheng had dealt with one, he had repeatedly killed it for about five minutes before it disappeared forever.</p>

  <p>After a while, the white mists that had dispersed reappeared in a second and charged towards him.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop..."</p>

  <p>Another nine red fist marks popped up on the chests of the human-shaped mists, and then they were crushed again.</p>

  <p>The human-shaped white mists ceaselessly reappeared, and the red fist marks destroyed them over and over again...</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge looked around in surprise. Of course, they wanted to know who helped them.</p>

  <p>However, the white mist was too thick to dissolve. Even if the helper was very close, they still couldn't see them!</p>

  <p>After each of the nine human-shaped white mists was killed a dozen times, they were finally gone for good.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Zheng and Feng Ge didn't feel relieved. After all, both of them saw a red light in the white mist, which became brighter and brighter.</p>

  <p>Finally, it emerged out of the white mist and appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>It turned out, that it was one of the two Nihility Spirits of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>"How dare you enter this dangerous place if you can't defeat the fog spirits?</p>

  <p>You two are quite bold..." soft female voice came from the red ball.</p>

  <p>Zheng simply frowned and did not refute, as what the Nihility Spirit said was reasonable.</p>

  <p>Relying on his powerful physical body and the methods of the purified being, he thought that he could act recklessly in the Dark Region. He explored such a dangerous place without any knowledge. Overall, he was indeed a bit rash.</p>

  <p>But, why did the Nihility Spirit save him?</p>
