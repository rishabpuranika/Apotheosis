<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Disbelief was written all over the faces of the warriors in the audience and the disciples of the fourth-grade sects on the elevated platforms.</p>

  <p>'A disciple of Cloud Hall? He reached the Martial Arts Contest through pre-qualifying match? But he's only at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm! What kind of ruckus is this?' they thought.</p>

  <p>"He's at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm. He will be killed the instant he walks on stage," said one of Bloodwood Cliff's disciples, who was at the Internal Elixir Realm. He stroked his nose and added, "It's a pity that I'm not his opponent. Otherwise, I would win this battle effortlessly!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, this guy at the Illuminating Soul Realm probably won't last one round on stage," another Bloodwood Cliff's disciple said with a regretful expression.</p>

  <p>Six disciples of Ethereal Spirit Sect, who were at the Internal Elixir Realm, sat cross-legged on the sect's elevated platform.</p>

  <p>Ethereal Spirit Sect had always been strict about its rules and regulations.</p>

  <p>Even though they were watching the battle, the disciples sat straight with solemn faces.</p>

  <p>Among these six people, the youngest one was only 15 years old, and there was a trace of a childish look on his face. Among the warriors participating in the Martial Arts Contest, he might not have the lowest cultivation level, but he was undoubtedly the youngest.</p>

  <p>He blinked and asked one of his companions, "Philip, didn't you say that I had the lowest cultivation level among all the participants? That fellow's cultivation level is lower than mine!"</p>

  <p>The man he was talking to was Philip, the eldest disciple of Ethereal Spirit Sect. He stared at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "A warrior at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm...This is strange. But Brent, you have to remember not to underestimate your opponent just because his cultivation level is lower than yours. Although you are at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, no one would dare to think low of you."</p>

  <p>"I got it," Brent nodded. "But I don't think he is as strong as me! He wouldn't be able to defeat me when I was at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm two months ago."</p>

  <p>Brent stared at Luo Luo Zheng with a confident expression.</p>

  <p>If the others were to hear his words, they would be shocked. Brent had progressed from the fourth grade to the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm in two months! His talent was incomparable.</p>

  <p>Philip smiled and shook his head. He didn't understand why Brent would take Luo Luo Zheng, a nobody, so seriously.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, geniuses were usually divided into four ranks? human-level talent, earth-level talent, heaven-level talent, and saint-level talent.</p>

  <p>The elite disciples of a fourth-grade sect were usually human-level talents or earth-level talents.</p>

  <p>If one was evaluated as a heaven-level talent, then it would be enough for any sect to train him wholeheartedly. This was because a heaven-level talent could very well become the core of the sect in the future.</p>

  <p>As for a saint-level talent, as long as he didn't die, becoming an elder of a great sect was a sure thing. If he worked even harder, he might also become the head of the sect.</p>

  <p>But Brent's talent was even greater, as it surpassed the saint level. In the history of the Central Region, there had never been a warrior with such talent. He could be considered a divine-level talent!</p>

  <p>Even Philip, a saint-level talent, who was at the middle grade of the Internal Elixir Realm, didn't have the confidence to defeat Brent, who was at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Even the head of Ethereal Spirit Sect was certain that as long as Brent didn't die, he would become an emperor in the future.</p>

  <p>In their realm, an emperor did not refer to the emperor of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>Instead, it meant that he would have the strength to build a sacred place or a divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>"If you like, you can try battling him after you get a challenge card," Philip said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Brent sighed, "Alas. Let's see if he survives this round."</p>

  <p>In the Martial Arts Contest, the winners of every battle were allowed to have a prize draw in which they would receive either an exemption card or a challenge card.</p>

  <p>If a warrior had an exemption card, he could avoid a battle. If a warrior had a challenge card, he could challenge any opponent.</p>

  <p>However, by the time Brent's turn arrived, many battles would have already taken place. In Brent's opinion, with Luo Zheng's cultivation level, he would probably be dead or seriously injured by then.</p>

  <p>The five disciples of Cloud Hall were even more baffled.</p>

  <p>This time, the five disciples sent by Cloud Hall were naturally the elites of the sect. Blake Zong and Benson Xuanyuan were the strongest among the five.</p>

  <p>When they heard Luo Luo Zheng being introduced to the audience, they turned to look at Ning Yudie. However, Yudie's face was covered by a layer of iced frog, and no one could tell what was on her mind.</p>

  <p>Since they didn't get an explanation from Ning Yudie, they could only discuss it among themselves.</p>

  <p>"This is strange. Why would a disciple of Cloud Hall appear among the independent warriors? Who is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo?" Blake said in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Sitting on the edge of the elevated platform, Benson smiled and said casually, "Blake, you have been out training for the past half year. I guess you have not heard the story of an arrogant disciple from Cloud Hall. When he was still a nature creature, he had challenged all the disciples in the Elite House on his own."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Could such a thing really have happened?" Blake's expression reflected the bewilderment that he felt.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was only at the nature level when he fought continuously against the disciples of Elite House. After half a year, he stepped into the Illuminating Soul Realm. I wonder if his true combat strength has increased along with his cultivation level," Benson said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Blake studied Luo Luo Zheng with a complex expression. "I hope so. He's still a disciple of Cloud Hall. If he was to be defeated on stage and even seriously injured, it would bring shame to Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>Everyone watched carefully when Luo Luo Zheng stepped onto the stage.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Dragon Soar Arena, killing Marilyn was Luo Zheng's first goal.</p>

  <p>Marilyn was at the middle grade of the Internal Elixir Realm. If Luo Luo Zheng wanted to kill her, he would have to catch her off guard. Therefore, he had to conceal his true strength first.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng stood on the stage, Alex, an independent warrior, also came onto the stage.</p>

  <p>A heated discussion was triggered among the warriors when Luo Luo Zheng arrived.</p>

  <p>After all, with his cultivation level, it would have been extremely hard for Luo Luo Zheng to qualify for the Martial Arts Contest.</p>

  <p>However, when Alex walked onto the stage, many warriors in the audience suddenly became excited.</p>

  <p>The reason was simple. Although all the warriors in the Central Region wanted to come to Oracle City to watch the Martial Arts Contest, at least half of the warriors in the audience were from Oracle City.</p>

  <p>And Alex was a member of the Gongsun Clan, one of the three major clans in Oracle City. He was a local warrior from Oracle City. Thus, the local people would support him.</p>

  <p>"Alex is so lucky to battle with a guy at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm."</p>

  <p>"Alex is a lucky dog! I am confident that he will be able to enter the top ten of the Martial Arts Contest and receive a great reward from the World Commercial Alliance!"</p>

  <p>"The Gongsun Clan nurtured Alex with all of their resources. He is a heaven-level talent. If he were a disciple of some fourth-grade sect, he would be surely considered a core disciple. He is not inferior to those warriors from the large sects on the elevated platforms!"</p>

  <p>"Kill that guy at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Don't be afraid of Cloud Hall. I want to see blood!"</p>

  <p>Amid this intense discussion, the corners of Alex's mouth curved up slightly. This was the advantage of being a native warrior. The vast majority of warriors in the audience were on his side. This would put his opponent under a formidable amount of pressure.</p>

  <p>However, in this battle, Alex did not need to give his opponent this pressure because his opponent was truly too weak.</p>

  <p>Alex removed two swords from his space ring. One was green, and the other was gold. They were both middle-grade fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows rose slightly when he saw the swords. "Twin-sword school?"</p>

  <p>Among swordsmen, there were very few who used twin swords. Up until now, Luo Luo Zheng had only seen Lenard from Skytop Peak use twin swords.</p>

  <p>The advantage of using twin swords was undeniable. Each of the warrior's hands would be armed with a sword. When paired with the swordsmanship of twin swords, he would unleash a greater power. After all, the swordsmanship cultivation pursued extreme sword intent. Using twin swords to cultivate one's sword intent would be many times as hard as using a single sword. This was also the reason why most swordsmen would give up on using twin swords.</p>

  <p>"Really? You know about twin-sword school?" Alex smiled blandly, and swung the twin swords in his hands, releasing a torrent of golden sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Hearing Alex's words, Luo Luo Zheng returned the bland smile. He had never minded others looking down on him because such people would eventually pay with their lives.</p>

  <p>"Even though your cultivation level is very low, don't expect me to show mercy. And don't think that I would underestimate my opponent," Alex said, pointing both swords at Luo Luo Zheng. "As the saying goes, 'even when facing a rabbit, a lion will also use all its strength.' Since you are on stage, I believe you are mentally prepared to die."</p>
