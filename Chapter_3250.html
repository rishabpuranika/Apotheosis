  <p>
</p>

  <p>In ancient times, the warriors of the Source World mainly cultivated the Wild God system, and they used the Ancient God Cultivation Method to enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>At that time, it was much easier to travel on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>A Wild God could become tens of thousands of feet tall. As the corporeal body was far stronger than the soul, warriors of the Source World were immensely powerful when they entered the Other Shore with their real bodies. At that time, the creatures on the Other Shore, who were at a significant disadvantage, were easily slaughtered by the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>A race like them could only hide in a corner of the Ancestral Glory Stage.</p>

  <p>Every time the Wild Gods plundered the Other Shore, it was disastrous for the whole Abyss Spirit race.</p>

  <p>At one point, the Wild Gods had almost annihilated the Abyss Spirit race!</p>

  <p>Everything happened at that time was like a nightmare. This was indeed a dark period for the Abyss Spirit race.</p>

  <p>After the decline of the cultivation method of the Wild Gods and changes in the truth rules, the creatures on the Other Shore earned a gradual respite.</p>

  <p>This reprieve allowed struggling races, like the Abyss Spirit race, to pull through. Eventually, these creatures turned the tables and took the lead.</p>

  <p>Those who entered the Other Shore later were weak Souls of Light. Without their corporeal bodies, how could they possibly be a match for the creatures on the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>As a result, the races on the Other Shore took furious revenge for what they had endured!</p>

  <p>At that time, stages above Stage Four were death land for the powerful warriors of the Other Shore Realm. They were extremely dangerous places, and any Other Shore Realm warrior that entered would die because none could resist the attack of the races on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why most races had built their temples on Stage Four. Although there were also Other Shore creatures that lived on Stage One to Stage Four, they hadn't formed any groups, and they wouldn't target the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Over time, the hatred the Other Shore creatures harbored for the Source World warriors gradually subsided. No one knew why.</p>

  <p>From the middle ages until now, the Other Shore creatures and the Souls of Light had managed to co-exist peacefully. Some of the large races even chose to form alliances with the races on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Spirit race and the Separate Abyss race, for example, were connected by blood, and thus, naturally associated.</p>

  <p>After the few Separate Abyss members, who had extorted soul pills from warriors passing through Stage Eleven, fled, the matter was reported to the senior leaders of their race. These senior leaders quickly communicated with the Abyss Spirit race, who then sent Abyss Spirit knights to confront Zheng before he could destroy the temple of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>These Abyss Spirit knights were almost invincible. Although their cultivation was not extraordinary, the Souls of Light in the Lust World could not resist them at all. Unfortunately for these Abyss Spirit knights, they had no idea that they were about to deal with a corporeal body!</p>

  <p>Naturally, what they saw before their eyes alarmed them. The fear hidden deep within their hearts erupted and coursed through them like an unstoppable force.</p>

  <p>Those who had survived the dark ages would never want that history to repeat itself.</p>

  <p>And people who had heard about the dark times would always be seized by terror whenever they thought about it.</p>

  <p>If warriors could enter the Other Shore with their corporeal bodies again, it would undoubtedly mean the return of the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Wild God?"</p>

  <p>A playful smile appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>In the entire chaos, perhaps only those living at the bottom of the chaos cultivated the Wild God system. However, none of them could use the Ancient God Cultivation Method to enter the Other Shore. Zheng had not tried to activate his Wild Body after he arrived on the Other Shore. He said to the Abyss Spirit knights, "Is this the Wild God you were discussing?"</p>

  <p>Then, his body began to grow.</p>

  <p>In a flash, his body reached over ten thousand feet in height.</p>

  <p>Even the Abyss Spirit knights who were sitting on the back of the eagles needed to look up at him.</p>

  <p>They paled and the flying eagles became restless at the sight of Zheng's enlarged body.</p>

  <p>"He really cultivates the Wild God system!"</p>

  <p>"I heard about the Wild Gods from my grandfather, but I didn't expect him to grow to such a massive size!"</p>

  <p>"He is probably over ten thousand tall, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Spirit knights present stared at Zheng with their mouths wide open.</p>

  <p>Even the large number of Souls of Light from the Separate Abyss race, who were in the city, gaped at Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the Abyss Spirit knights arrived, it boosted the morale of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the Separate Abyss race in the city had often heard about the powerful strength of the Abyss Spirit knights, but none had ever seen it. Over the years, no one had dared to make trouble on Stage Eleven.</p>

  <p>Even if someone caused trouble, it was not serious enough to alert the Abyss Spirit knights!</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that such a powerful team of Abyss Spirit knights would be so weak in front of Zheng?</p>

  <p>They were all depressed, shocked, and confused when they saw Zheng's body expand to such a degree in the blink of an eye. The Souls of Light exuded an aura of fear, and the more cowardly ones retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But most of them were reluctant to leave.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear! Did fate send him to wipe out our Separate Abyss race?"</p>

  <p>"We, the Separate Abyss race, have occupied Stage Eleven for many years.</p>

  <p>Is this the end of our happy days?"</p>

  <p>"It seems that... our temple might be destroyed today."</p>

  <p>In the corner of this large city, the Soul of Light of the Separate Abyss race, who had blackmailed Zheng, trembled when he saw Zheng's colossal body. It was only now that he understood where Zheng's confidence came from, and he was regretful for what he had done before.</p>

  <p>"One hundred million soul pills is not an exorbitant amount to pay to make him leave."</p>

  <p>"One hundred million soul pills!"</p>

  <p>"Give them to him!" the Soul of Light muttered as he rushed into the temple. He was so terrorized by fear that he was already out of his mind.</p>

  <p>On the square outside the city, many non-human creatures also saw the giant figure rising on the horizon. Zheng's body was so enormous that it would be difficult for them not to notice him.</p>

  <p>"That is a human?"</p>

  <p>"He seems familiar. Could it be the man who was here just now?"</p>

  <p>"How did this person become so huge?"</p>

  <p>Although these non-human creatures knew that Zheng wanted to make trouble for the Separate Abyss race, they never expected that he would use such an incredible way...</p>

  <p>Currently, the temple only reached Zheng's calf. It seemed as though he could trample an entire temple just by lifting his leg. While the thought terrified everyone, only Zheng knew that he wasn't capable of such damage.</p>

  <p>Although he had absorbed a large number of wild bones, the limit his body could grow into was far more than ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>However, the Wild God Power was incomparable to the Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>After all, the Wild Gods corresponded to True Gods, and when Zheng was just a consummate True God, the force he could unleash with his full strength was only one divine megaton.</p>

  <p>As the ancient Wild Gods, who had used the Ancient God Cultivation Method to enter the Other Shore, cultivated Truth of Powerful Holy Body, they were able to merge with Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was special as he hadn't cultivated the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. And so, he didn't know whether his body could merge with Other Shore Tokens, or if it could, how he should go about it.</p>

  <p>Just then, three more eagles flew toward Zheng from outside the city.</p>

  <p>Three elders of the Abyss Spirit race were on the backs of these flying eagles. They had lived for a very long time, as evident from their shrunken sizes. They were pygmies when compared with the Abyss Spirit knights.</p>

  <p>The three old men hovered in front of Zheng. The white-haired old man at the helm asked, "Human boy, why do you destroy our city and temple for no reason?"</p>

  <p>Zheng sneered, "Ask the Separate Abyss race. They forced a human to pay one million soul pills to pass Stage Eleven. How could you say that I have no reason?"</p>
