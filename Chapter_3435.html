<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng sat on the metal plate, feeling uncharacteristically helpless. He tried to keep a poker face but he knew his expression showed his anxiety.</p>

  <p>The little monster in his hand was now making strange wheezing sounds, almost like laughter. To Zheng, it was as though the monster was laughing at him for falling into their trap.</p>

  <p>It turned out that this metal plate had originally been a cage.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the debris that could be used to block the blue light.</p>

  <p>But no matter who was attacked by these little monsters, they would try to find an object to use as a shield.</p>

  <p>Those little monsters had released a blue light which struck the metal plate, reminding Zheng that it could deflect the blue light.</p>

  <p>So he jumped to the metal plate, and found himself locked in a cage.</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out a finger and tapped lightly on the metal plate. That small tap released eight hundred divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>A deep sound burst out, like the striking of an enormous gong.</p>

  <p>The metal plate remained motionless. It had not even been dented.</p>

  <p>Zheng realized that the metal plate was more solid than he had imagined. It would be impossible for him to break it.</p>

  <p>His eyes darted around him, searching for a way out. Then his gaze landed on the blue lights around the metal plate.</p>

  <p>He took out a khaki shield from his space ring. Someone from an alien race had accidentally dropped the shield in the Chaotic Source World, and Zheng had grabbed it up. It was a valuable treasure. Taking a firm grip on the shield, he brushed it lightly against the fences of blue lights.</p>

  <p>To his disappointment, instead of deflecting the blue lights, the edge of the shield was cleanly sliced off.</p>

  <p>Zheng was confident in his own toughness, but he didn't dare try to breach the blue light barrier with his own body. He had a feeling he wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p>

  <p>"Maybe spatial transference..." he murmured to himself, thinking rapidly.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and focused, trying to launch the Grand Teleportation technique so he could leave the metal plate.</p>

  <p>However, he failed to construct a space channel through which he could travel. His Space Law didn't work here.</p>

  <p>Spatial transference was prohibited in the Chaotic Source World. The space had been confined by some mighty warriors, leading to ordinary space channel unable to break through the space imprisonment.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that there was no Space Law in this place. It was impossible for him to carry out spatial transference.</p>

  <p>Zheng racked his brain, but he couldn't think of anything else he could try.</p>

  <p>Having exhausted all his options, he sighed and sat quietly on the metal plate, waiting to see what would happen next.</p>

  <p>The little monster in his grip was still making that strange laughing sound.</p>

  <p>Zheng scowled and raised his arm, as though to throw it towards the blue light fences.</p>

  <p>The little monster seemed to understand what he was planning, and it gave a frightened squeak.</p>

  <p>Zheng paused. So the little monsters were also afraid of the blue lights? The light was released from their own eyes, yet they feared it.</p>

  <p>The little monster struggled and twisted madly in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Zheng hadn't really planned on killing his only companion inside this trap. He just wanted to frighten it. He lowered his hand back to his side, and the little monster stopped struggling. He released his grip and the little monster lay down next to Zheng. It had finally stopped laughing.</p>

  <p>'Since these little monsters were able to set this trap, they must be an intelligent race. The key is to find a way to communicate with them. Let's see what they want from me..."</p>

  <p>While Zheng was pondering his predicament, the little monsters— who had been running and jumping around on the surrounding debris— began gathering under the metal plate.</p>

  <p>They pressed against the metal plate, lifting Zheng from the debris. To Zheng's surprise, these little monsters lifted him slowly but steadily upwards.</p>

  <p>They moved upward for about five minutes, passing through thick clusters of debris. Zheng didn't move, fearful of sliding off the plate and into the blue lights. After they made a turn, the sight before Zheng surprised him.</p>

  <p>As they moved forward, the debris thinned and then disappeared completely. Ahead of him lay a vast city of ruins.</p>

  <p>The sprawling city was an eyesore. Arrays of dilapidated houses lined the haphazard streets, and everything seemed to be made of different materials and colors. Even the sizes of the structures varied greatly. A lot of the buildings seemed to be on the verge of falling apart altogether.</p>

  <p>Hordes of little monsters seemed to be tucked into every nook and cranny of the strange city. From the roofs, windows, and undersides of every structure, little monsters poked out their heads and stared at the arriving alien prisoner.</p>

  <p>As soon as they reached the center of the city of ruins, the little monsters laid down the metal plate carrying Zheng. They started to leave.</p>

  <p>The little monster who was locked with Zheng in the cage screamed, as if calling its companions back. They ignored it. They obviously had no intention of letting it out of the cage.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood and looked around him, taking in the unusual sights of this strange new world.</p>

  <p>This space was deleted from the chaos. It was not erased during the process.</p>

  <p>Just like Zheng, it would probably feel lonely after being expelled here.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's inner world, there were still living creatures, including the human race and a variety of other kinds of creatures. He had the ability to pull out these creatures to accompany him in the real world. He could even grow them into a city or a country.</p>

  <p>He realized that his relationship with the creatures in his inner world was probably like the relationship of this space to these little monsters. He wondered what they planned to do with him.</p>

  <p>As Zheng sat in his cage, several little monsters cautiously came up to him, studying him with intense interest. Their large eyes were alight with curiosity and wonder, as though they were looking at a great and mysterious treasure.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, lost in his own thoughts, Zheng wasn't even aware that he was being observed. Eventually, however, he began to notice the fixed stares of the little monsters around him, and he felt uneasy.</p>

  <p>"What do they mean by staring at me like that, No. 9527?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was also quietly observing the strange world. It knew that there were some special spaces outside the chaos. For example, the Other Shore was a special space at the top of the chaos. After being destroyed, the past civilizations would enter the Other Shore, which was the last place to protect them, and to hide their secrets.</p>

  <p>What about this space?</p>

  <p>This space was a huge trash bin. Apparently, there were some special cases which drove the Chaos Ancient God who controlled the space to just delete them. These cases were thrown into the trash bin, which was where Zheng had now ended up.</p>

  <p>No. 9527's master was not that Chaos Ancient God, so it was unfamiliar with this world. But it was as curious about the little monsters as they were about Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they want to eat you," No. 9527 joked.</p>

  <p>Zheng scowled, "In case you haven't noticed, I have no escape plan. That's not funny at all."</p>

  <p>He was worried because in fact, No. 9527's "joke" was an actual possibility.</p>

  <p>He remembered that the little monster he first found in the cave had been looking for the bodies of small animals. It seemed fair to assume that the little monsters lived by eating meat.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 sensed his anxiety and turned serious. "Look at their expressions.</p>

  <p>You're very important to them. It's not likely that they'll just slaughter and eat you, but they definitely have plans for you."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded absently, narrowing his eyes at the little monsters.</p>

  <p>He was just a human that had been deleted from the Source World. What possible value could he have for these little monsters that grew up in this abandoned space?</p>

  <p>Zheng wondered what had happened after he was removed. He suspected he was the first person ever to be removed by deletion.</p>

  <p>He was tense and imprisoned, anticipating the different things that the little monsters could do to him. But for hours, nothing happened. Half a day passed in this manner. Then, all of a sudden, Zheng was alerted to a commotion in the distance. The door to one of the city's bigger structures was opening, and dozens of little monsters crawled out.</p>

  <p>These little monsters were actually not as little as the ones that had brought him to this city. The one in the center of the group wore a large and exquisite golden ring. It had an air of authority. It seemed to be the most powerful of the little monsters.</p>

  <p>The little monsters approached Zheng's cage.</p>

  <p>In a moment, they had leaped forward and surrounded Zheng entirely, staring at him. He stared back.</p>

  <p>They began leaping up and down, especially the little monster with a golden ring. It looked at Zheng intensely, but spoke in a gentle voice, as though it was trying not to make him frightened.</p>

  <p>Zheng paid close attention to every sound and gesture, but it was useless. He couldn't make out even a single word of what any of the little monsters were saying. He was unable to communicate with them at all.</p>
