  <p>
</p>

  <p>To the Evil God, anyone who was against him must be eliminated.</p>

  <p>Even those who didn't provoke him would end up dead. Those who dared take the initiative to provoke him would face even worse.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had been looking for a way to kill the heads after they invaded his territory.</p>

  <p>Why would he care what they hated the most?</p>

  <p>But he changed his mind now.</p>

  <p>The Source World was too large. Even if the Evil God had tens of thousands of avatars, he still couldn't guard every corner.</p>

  <p>If he could use some method to force them to gather in one place, he could then easily kill them.</p>

  <p>Edna saw the sparkle in the Evil God's eyes, but didn't know what was on his mind. She stuttered, "I...I don't know what they hate."</p>

  <p>"But they will know," the Evil God said confidently.</p>

  <p>An idea was forming in the Evil God's mind.</p>

  <p>And then, a consciousness appeared in the minds of the ten thousand Evil Gods in the huge black square. The order given to them by their master was always top priority to them.</p>

  <p>"The master orders us to find the weakness of these heads?"</p>

  <p>"What do they hate?"</p>

  <p>"We have to test them one by one. We will find it out!"</p>

  <p>"These heads are stupid, and their behavior pattern is simple. We can start from their mode of behavior!"</p>

  <p>These avatars of the Evil God were as smart as their master. The Evil God had only to give them a hint and they would begin to brainstorm and make plans.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of avatars were now in a heated discussion, the huge square suddenly becoming noisy. It had now become difficult to hear anything.</p>

  <p>"It's so noisy! Stop it, you idiots!" an avatar cursed angrily.</p>

  <p>The other avatars quickly closed their mouths and began to communicate with each other through their spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>The tens of thousands of avatars thought differently, but they were very efficient and quickly came up with several plans.</p>

  <p>These plans were voted on and they finally decided on one that seemed to be the best. They would split up to test the characteristics of the heads.</p>

  <p>The avatars had originally been searching for the heads in the Source World in order to kill them, but they now quickly changed their strategy.</p>

  <p>Since the Heavenly Martial Province was the weakest, it had attracted the most heads.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had killed for several rounds here, but before long, this place would once again be filled with heads. The heads here were the most suitable for them to carry out the test. dozens of avatars found some hosts in the Heavenly Martial Province and possessed them in unison. They captured dozens of heads that had expanded to several times their original size in the shortest time and began the test.</p>

  <p>"The first test, flame token!"</p>

  <p>Blazing flames swept out and enveloped a head.</p>

  <p>The flames burned the head till it turned black.</p>

  <p>But the head still had its mouth open wide, trying to devour everything in front of it. It even swallowed a portion of the flames.</p>

  <p>"Stronger flames!"</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>When another avatar released more powerful flames, the head couldn't bear it anymore, and cracks appeared on its surface. Before long, it exploded into pieces, the force emanating from the center and rippling towards the edges.</p>

  <p>Their goal was not to kill the heads, which meant that the first test had failed.</p>

  <p>"The second test, use the ice wall to trap the head!"</p>

  <p>"The third test, use lightning to bind it."</p>

  <p>"The fourth test, use the force of fear."</p>

  <p>"The fifth test, possess its consciousness."</p>

  <p>In less than two hours, the avatars had tested dozens of theurgies.</p>

  <p>The heads had no soul, so they couldn't be controlled by the soul-related theurgies.</p>

  <p>The other theurgies would cause them no fear. The heads would be killed once the power of the theurgies increased.</p>

  <p>"The fifty-sixth test, surround the head with space walls!"</p>

  <p>A complete cubic space trapped within itself a head that had expanded to ten times its original size. The head screamed as it crashed into the space wall, with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>"The fifty-sixth test failed. Remove the space walls and prepare for the next test," an avatar announced.</p>

  <p>"Wait," another avatar said. "Don't remove the space walls."</p>

  <p>"Don't waste time," the first avatar said, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Look, the head didn't bite into the space wall. It looks like it can't see the wall!" the second avatar said.</p>

  <p>At this, the other avatars turned their gazes to the head and did indeed find something strange.</p>

  <p>"Remove the other five space walls," the Evil God ordered.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!"</p>

  <p>Once the other space walls were removed, the head still didn't react and continued to strike the space wall before it.</p>

  <p>"The head can't sense the power of space!" As the avatar spoke, he wrapped his body with the power of space, and then flew towards the head.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>The huge head hit the avatar over and over again, which was tiny compared to the head's size, but it looked like it never intended to open its mouth and swallow the tiny thing that was in its way!</p>

  <p>"We've found a way," the avatar said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Before long, an avatar flew into the hall from the square.</p>

  <p>"Master, I think I have found a way to deal with them," the avatar said.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes flashed with surprise. "So soon?"</p>

  <p>It had only been a few hours since Edna had reminded him, and they had already found a way to restrain the heads. The Evil God was naturally surprised.</p>

  <p>"The perception of the heads is very poor. They can't perceive space. As long as we hide behind the space walls, they won't be able to sense their targets," the avatar said.</p>

  <p>"Space?" The Evil God thought for a while before saying, "But it's still quite difficult to construct a huge space wall that can completely wrap around the Source World."</p>

  <p>"There's no need for the space wall," the avatar said. "You can stretch the space wall into a net, and the heads won't notice it. I've already tested it."</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on the Evil God's face. "Brilliant! Very good!"</p>

  <p>The avatar also smiled. "I need a reward."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" the Evil God said, his eyes stunned but wary.</p>

  <p>The avatar pointed at Edna, who was standing beside the Evil God, and said, "She is your woman, and also mine."</p>

  <p>Edna hadn't expected the avatar to make such a request and didn't know what to do.</p>

  <p>What was more, she couldn't tell who the real Evil God was and who the avatar was. Sometimes, she even suspected that the real Evil God had died a long time ago.</p>

  <p>"Okay," the Evil God said, nodding. "Come here!"</p>

  <p>The avatar walked over to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>But the moment he got close to the Evil God, the Evil God stretched out a hand and gently tapped at his forehead. The avatar's face began to change, and he turned into a black skinned creature.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The creature had gained his own consciousness, but before he could realize what was happening to him, the Evil God cut his neck off his body.</p>

  <p>Black blood splashed all over the ground.</p>

  <p>"Darling, why did you kill him?" asked Edna.</p>

  <p>"He has gained his own consciousness. If his consciousness grows stronger, he would definitely betray me," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the avatars of the Evil God were completely in sync with their master, and they executed their master's orders without any questions.</p>

  <p>But if they were separated from their master for a long time or had any kind of special experience, their consciousness would begin to deviate.</p>

  <p>If this were to happen, the Evil God would kill them without mercy.</p>

  <p>The person who knew one the best was always themselves, and they would never be loyal to anyone else. Once these avatars gained an independent consciousness, they would even betray themselves.</p>
