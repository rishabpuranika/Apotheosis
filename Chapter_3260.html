<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3260 All Sorts Of Races </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While the ultimate goal of the Ear Mouse race wasn't to earn money, they couldn't pass this opportunity to earn a large sum of soul pills.</p>

  <p>They were well aware of how the elite disciples from all races were eager to explore the three huts in the Dark Region. Truly, it was quite a big price to pay, but all the creatures present had no choice.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was just too elusive. Not knowing when the temple would open again, they were willing to pay a hefty sum just to enter the gate.</p>

  <p>"The Ear Mice are too greedy!" complained a member of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse remained calm. "I'm afraid out of everyone here, you are in the worst position to call us greedy."</p>

  <p>The complainant was taken aback. But it was true; the past years, the Separate Abyss race had controlled Stage Eleven. Whoever wanted to reach Stage Twelve needed to pay a large sum of soul pills to the Separate Abyss race. No one knew how many soul pills they had accumulated all these years. This was practically robbery!</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse just shrugged. It knew its race was just conducting business.</p>

  <p>"Before opening the gate, we'll set a restraining force in front of the Grand Sky Temple. Everyone can use soul pills to exchange for a soul mark.</p>

  <p>Those with soul marks can go through the restraining force," the Ear Mouse announced.</p>

  <p>Although the Souls of Light were extremely dissatisfied, they knew they had no other choice.</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race all seethed with rage. Ultimately, however, they ended up paying their entry in soul pills and each obtained a soul mark.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Souls of Light who could afford it also paid the price and received their soul marks.</p>

  <p>Those who couldn't afford it all looked gloomy. They had only brought 200, 000 to 300, 000 soul pills, which would've been more than enough according to the normal market price. They didn't expect the Ear Mouse race would skyrocket its price.</p>

  <p>Others left the Other Shore to ask for help from the members of their race.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to enter the Grand Sky Temple was just too great, they couldn't bear to let it pass.</p>

  <p>At a corner of the gathered souls stood six Souls of Light from the human race.</p>

  <p>The girl at the leftmost was the most petite. Judging from her silhouette, she was obviously a young lady.</p>

  <p>"Brother, we may not be able to get in the temple," the human girl said in disappointment.</p>

  <p>"A million soul pills per Soul of Light?! We would have to pay six million!</p>

  <p>These damned mice!" the tallest of the six said through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"We must think of a way to raise some soul pills!" another man suggested optimistically.</p>

  <p>"How in the world will we raise enough soul pills?" the young girl pouted.</p>

  <p>"I still owe someone 200, 000 soul pills."</p>

  <p>She was the same girl who had been detained by the Separate Abyss race in Stage Eleven.</p>

  <p>Even though Dorothy had been quite generous and told her that she didn't need to pay her back, the young girl still felt indebted to her.</p>

  <p>Another person mocked her, "You owe someone 200, 000 soul pills by passing through Stage Eleven? Well done!"</p>

  <p>The human girl frowned. She was obviously displeased. "What choice did I have in that situation?"</p>

  <p>"Enough! Quit arguing." The tallest of the six put a stop to their meaningless quarrel. "I'm going to raise enough soul pills for all of us. You stay here and wait. Although our Nine Li race was destroyed, I don't believe that will stop us from raising six million soul pills."</p>

  <p>Obviously, this man was the leader among the six. As soon as he spoke, the others fell silent. He could tell, however, that his speech didn't boost his peers' morale.</p>

  <p>Of course, raising six million soul pills would be no easy task. While their race had once been one of the four major human forces, now they were quite desolate.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, by the gate of the Grand Sky Temple, a line of Souls of Light had formed. Each paid their entry fee and obtained their soul mark.</p>

  <p>A few hours passed. By this time, even more races had gathered around the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>Nine Souls of Light trudged straight to the gate.</p>

  <p>From the torso upwards, they were human, but their lower bodies terminated in snake tails.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Goddess race!"</p>

  <p>"Damn, the Snake Goddess race is here as well."</p>

  <p>While they were normal humans in the Source World, on the Other Shore, their Souls of Light were half human, half snake. This made it easy for them to be distinguished among the other Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race was an esteemed super force in the Source World.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Other Shore was prosperous thanks to that race.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess race had always been known to be peaceful and non-aggressive. They were seldom in conflict with other races.</p>

  <p>After learning the price of the entrance fee, they nonchalantly paid the soul pills, each earning their soul mark. Then, they retreated to the side of the gate.</p>

  <p>The super powers were making their way here, one after another. Another powerful race made their way to the front.</p>

  <p>"The Bearing race?"</p>

  <p>"Wow, there are quite a few members from the Bearing race."</p>

  <p>"They'll need to take out tens of millions of soul pills. Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>More than twenty people from the Bearing race showed up, causing a stir among the other creatures.</p>

  <p>Technically, all the races would compete against each other in the Grand Sky Temple. With so many members of the Bearing race present, they obviously had an advantage over the other races.</p>

  <p>Many more races arrived. At this point, another group of eight reached the gate.</p>

  <p>"They are from the Oneness Sky Palace!"</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace doesn't seem to have much confidence. They only sent eight people."</p>

  <p>"Now that the Oneness Sky Palace is being bullied by the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race, it must be difficult for them to compete."</p>

  <p>Among the eight figures, their leader overheard the whispers amongst the other creatures.</p>

  <p>Her expression darkened. In an indifferent tone, she said loudly, "The Oneness Sky Palace is being bullied by the Bearing race? Not long ago, a certain race's temple was destroyed. I wonder which race that was."</p>

  <p>The news that Zheng had completely demolished the Bearing race's temple wasn't that widespread, since the Bearing race went through great lengths to keep it hush. However, this didn't stop the members of the Bearing race from frowning at her words.</p>

  <p>The other races just shrugged, puzzled. After all, they didn't really understand what had really happened.</p>

  <p>"Humph! If it weren't for the help of that mysterious man, all of your elite disciples would've died!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. You are just a group of nobodies.</p>

  <p>We will destroy you one day!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race began to taunt in defense.</p>

  <p>The woman from the Oneness Sky Palace fumed. She wasn't good at retorting, so she just threatened, "Humph! Do you want to die?"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As she channeled her soul force, golden patterns began to appear around her Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"The divine flames of the Sun Crow race?"</p>

  <p>"How could this Oneness Sky Palace member use the divine flames of the Sun Crow race?"</p>

  <p>"Weird. Are these people from the Oneness Sky Palace or not?"</p>

  <p>From a distance, members of the Sun Crow race flapped their wings in confusion, discussing amongst themselves in low voices at the sight of the golden flames.</p>

  <p>"It is her!"</p>

  <p>"It is said that only two people in the Oneness Sky Palace have the blood of the Sun Crow race."</p>

  <p>"The mother couldn't possibly be in the Lust World, so this must be the daughter."</p>

  <p>The conflict between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace had been going on for quite some time now. They were quickly able to perceive that the woman wielding their divine flames was Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, there were various bloodline theurgies. Some of them could be used on the Other Shore, and the divine flame of the Sun Crow race was one of them. Although using the divine flames by one's Soul of Light on the Other Shore was different from using it in the Source World and its power could be diminished, it was also an extremely powerful bloodline theurgy.</p>

  <p>But the Oneness Sky Palace was still outnumbered, eight to twenty. So the Bearing race just threw their heads back and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Hey, little girl, do you really want to fight all of us?"</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace disciples truly are so stupid. How dare you be so arrogant!"</p>

  <p>"You must be courting death, young lady!"</p>

  <p>The people from the Bearing race sneered at Feng Ge and her companions.</p>

  <p>Other races had gathered around the commotion. The Sun Crow race, as well as the Divine Farmer race, all thought Feng Ge was simply bluffing.</p>

  <p>Little did they know, she never bluffed.</p>
