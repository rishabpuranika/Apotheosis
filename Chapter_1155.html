  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fiona was in close proximity to Luo Zheng and kept on releasing the Purification Fire, slowly pushing the flame into his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could see the seriousness etched on her face.</p>

  <p>He didn't have any desire towards her while his thoughts were being purified by the Purification Fire. His mind had entered a very strange state, in which he was able to appreciate the princess of the Wind Divine Kingdom with an extremely pure mind.</p>

  <p>Fiona's skin was white as snow, her eyes pitch black and deep. Her eyelashes were constantly trembling, and her hair that was appropriately draped over her shoulders was like a beautiful piece of art.</p>

  <p>But as she became aware of Zheng's intense gaze upon her, Fiona suddenly felt shy. Her fair cheeks blushed crimson and her fingers trembled. The Purification Fire in her hand pulsed continuously as if it was beating at the same rate as her heart.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, her Purification Fire wouldn't hurt anyone, and it wouldn't burn Luo Zheng even when it randomly jumped about.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had smelted the weapons and absorbed a considerable amount of the heavenly essence, the curse power within the weapons had also been absorbed by him. And the amount of this curse power that gathered within him was quite large.</p>

  <p>Although the purification ability of her Purification Fire was extraordinary, it still required extreme control over the Fire Law on her part. Even if she had comprehended the third layer of the Fire Law, she could only turn her life vitality into the Purification Fire that was only as thick as a thumb. And it would still take a lot of time to cleanse all the curse power within Zheng's body with her Purification Fire.</p>

  <p>But the curse power that Luo Zheng had absorbed did begin to dissipate under the effect of the Purification Fire. An hour or so later, fine beads of sweat began to form on Fiona's forehead while the curse power emanating from Zheng's body became weaker and weaker.</p>

  <p>"Ah-ha! It's done!" Fiona let out a long breath as her face split into a wide, comfortable grin.</p>

  <p>Even after Fiona had extinguished the Purification Fire, Zheng's gaze remained fixed on her. He had entered a truly wondrous state of mind during this hour.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's opinion, there were many other uses of Fiona's Purification Fire in addition to expelling the curse power. For example, if a warrior could not calm down while cultivating, it would often result in a lot of distracting thoughts. Her Purification Fire, however, could remove all these distracting thoughts.</p>

  <p>And when Luo Zheng had been staring at Fiona for an hour without any distracting thoughts, her face had been deeply imprinted in his mind.</p>

  <p>Following this, a very strange feeling overcame Zheng's mind, not because he had a thing for Fiona, but because of a special kinship he felt for his savior.</p>

  <p>There was no way for Fiona to know what Luo Zheng was thinking when she realized he was still staring at her in a daze. She looked at him strangely before saying, "You still haven't told me how you managed to get the curse power into your body!"</p>

  <p>"Uh..." Luo Zheng couldn't just tell her the truth. He thought for a moment before saying, "Just look at it like me eating those weapons."</p>

  <p>Fiona's face filled with disbelief. But she was programmed in such a way that she didn't press on. She had never been overbearing towards anyone and she naturally wouldn't force Luo Zheng to tell her something that he wasn't willing to speak of.</p>

  <p>However, even if the warriors were to take these cursed weapons with them, the curse power wouldn't attack them immediately. It would be a while before the curse power would take effect and corrode their bodies.</p>

  <p>And even if Luo Zheng had really swallowed the weapons, it would have been impossible for him to absorb the curse power into his body in such a short period of time. Fiona's gaze swept the area. The bronze chests in front of her were already empty. There wasn't a single weapon in them, so what exactly was going on?</p>

  <p>'Why is Tianxing acting so strange?' she thought.</p>

  <p>She had been quietly observing Luo Zheng from the start. But ever since she had entered the Feather Holy Sea, instead of having a greater understanding of Luo Zheng, she found that he became more mysterious, as if he had countless secrets.</p>

  <p>But digging out a person's secrets was an interesting exercise. To Fiona, exploring the Feather Holy Sea was like taking a tour, and digging out Zheng's secrets was like a little game.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had already swallowed so much heavenly essence, he could not wait any longer and wanted to drain out all the energy within his body. So he and Fiona left the armory and returned to the pyramid together.</p>

  <p>By this time, most of the warriors who had gone to scavenge through the garbage had already returned from the armory. Because the danger of the mineral-devouring bugs had been eliminated, many divine-level talents had also entered the mining tree.</p>

  <p>This meant that the warriors trading in front of the pyramid were once again active.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng had returned, Camilla hastily waved at him. Her face was full of joy as she said, "Tianxing, come here! I've collected 36 more life stones!"</p>

  <p>The divine-level talents had managed to figure out Camilla's state of mind. This year, Luo Zheng and Camilla had been the ones to get all of the life stones. And now, the life stones had become a rarity, even rarer than other rare ores.</p>

  <p>The reason was simple. Mining other rare ores might not be useful; one might not even need them at all, only using them in exchange for something else. But mining the life stones would allow them to directly exchange them for the ores they needed from Camilla.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the number of life stones that had appeared was becoming smaller and smaller and the price that Camilla offered was getting higher and higher. The price that she had offered had already far exceeded the original value of the life stones.</p>

  <p>Of course, Camilla was clear about what was going on in Zheng's mind. He wanted as many life stones as possible no matter how high the cost. And no matter what, as long as the others used the life stones as an exchange, she would do her best to satisfy their requests.</p>

  <p>Even though Camilla was unwilling to suffer any losses, she would do this to help Luo Zheng exchange the life stones.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, a smile on his face. Although his goal had changed, he could still use the life stones.</p>

  <p>Even though he had smelted those cursed weapons, absorbed a lot of heavenly essence, and ignited more than ten thousand dragon scales, Luo Zheng was still not confident that he could break the golden leaf and take out the Black Star.</p>

  <p>So that meant that the life stones were still Zheng's choice. At worst, he could just take all the life stones that were produced this year and make a comeback next year.</p>

  <p>Callan also appeared outside the pyramid. He ran towards Fiona and shouted excitedly, "Fiona! Fiona! Look at this ore!"</p>

  <p>A bright red stone sat in Callan's hand. Its surface looked strange, with lines on it that looked like many clouds of fire. Whatever it was, it looked extremely beautiful.</p>

  <p>"What kind of stone is this?" Fiona blinked and stared curiously at it.</p>

  <p>The siblings of the Huo Clan didn't understand much about ores. Fiona's curiosity was piqued even further as she saw Callan's excitement.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also stared at the ore in bewilderment. He didn't see anything special about it other than its unique shape. The clouds of fire were distributed in such a regular pattern that they were most likely carved by hand.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng himself did not have the ability to identify ores, with his instincts and perception, he could probably distinguish between the good and the bad. And though some of the ores that he had given Camilla were normal ores, more than 70% of them were considered very rare.</p>

  <p>"This is the Black Heart Fire Stone! It is extremely useful for a warrior that cultivates the Fire Law. Fiona, this is for you!" Callan said with a wide smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression twisted even more. Camilla blinked several times before asking, "Black Heart Fire Stone? How come I've never heard of this type of ore before?"</p>

  <p>There were over a thousand types of ores in the mine and Camilla could recognize almost all of them. But she had never heard of the Black Heart Fire Stone.</p>

  <p>She gazed at the stone in Callan's hand. A whirl of thoughts went through her mind. 'Callan is a simple and honest person. It would be alright if he had dug up this stone by himself. But it would be a huge loss if he had obtained it from someone else. He might have been deceived by someone.'</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Camilla used her life vitality to explain her thoughts to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had had his suspicions and Camilla's analysis basically confirmed them. He asked, "Prince Callan, did you excavate this Black Heart Fire Stone yourself, or did you exchange it with someone else?"</p>
