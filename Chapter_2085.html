<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2085 Fighting Intent Penalty </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Xun appeared to be thinking of something. She knew Luo Zheng better than Supreme Lord of Oracle did, and she had also stayed in that fairy palace for a very long time.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng travelled to the Illusion Battlefield, Xun had often walked around the fairy palace, aimlessly and alone. The fairy palace still had many secrets that had yet to be revealed.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, from the palace, she could hear the barking of a dog.</p>

  <p>Although Xun had never seen Blackie before, the power contained in Blackie's roar had left a deep impression on her, who at the time, was still a soul body. Although she was fearless, when Blackie barked, the sound caused her to feel a lot of pressure, even if the distance between them was far too great.</p>

  <p>She guessed that Blayd must have come from the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Once Blayd had successfully destroyed the True God Souls one by one, he gradually slowed his speed and leisurely walked toward Marko.</p>

  <p>His long black hair draped messily over Blayd's shoulders, and his muscles were bulging, which made his body look as though it had been embedded with stones. His muscles even appeared to emit a faint glow, as if there was some kind of special power hidden within that was just waiting for the right moment to erupt.</p>

  <p>Once Marko, who was grabbing the Soul Searching Flag, noticed Blayd, his face finally revealed a hint of fear.</p>

  <p>He had already understood that the person before him didn't take him seriously at all and was even not afraid of his master.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Murphy was watching the ongoing battle in this universe, but he would never act rashly.</p>

  <p>Starting a war in the universe was not a small matter and definitely not something to be scoffed at. It required the Hall of Holy Beings' approval.</p>

  <p>Aside from Murphy in fact, many other Holy Beings were equally paying attention to the war. It was genuinely impossible for Murphy to openly violate the Hall of Holy Beings' rules by taking part in the war personally.</p>

  <p>In other words, under the attack of this random guy from the War God Hall, no one was permitted to help Marko resist.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods had peacefully lived for an extremely long period of time. According to the calendar in the Evolutionary Universe, their lifespan could reach tens of billions of years, or even hundreds of billions of years. In the divine land, there were even a few True Gods who had committed suicide because they had lived far too long a life and couldn't continue doing so anymore.</p>

  <p>Marko, on the other hand, was still an extremely young, remarkable True God. He still had an endless amount of longevity to enjoy. He could experience the endless cycle of reincarnation and enjoy the worship of billions of creatures...</p>

  <p>Until this very moment, he had never thought he could die in the Evolutionary Universe. He never imagined it would be possible.</p>

  <p>Right then, as he was out of the fear of death, Marko's only desire was to flee. There was only one place left to which he could escape, and that was the Murphy Universe. Although both universes were each fighting their own wars, and it wasn't safe even if he did escape back to the Murphy Universe, his master was still the ruler there and he was capable of setting up a strong enough barrier in the Murphy Universe in order to protect Marko's life.</p>

  <p>The moment this thought crossed his mind, his body began to flicker with a blazing white light, and he seemed to transform into a human silhouette before he started to disappear.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Blayd let out a grunt as the corner of his mouth curled up slightly. He suddenly raised an arm that was as heavy and weighted as a bucket of water, and threw a punch up toward the sky.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As a muffled sound echoed out, another space suddenly exploded and Marko's body staggered out from the void. Blood dripped from the corner of his mouth, and his eyes were brimming with resentment.</p>

  <p>Blayd's punch was exactly the same as the bite used by the Ancestral Dragon in order to thrust the Demon Night's Supreme Lord Korbin out of the space passageway. It had extreme power, to say the least.</p>

  <p>While the Ancestral Dragon relied on the space comprehension in order to stop Supreme Lord Korbin who employed the Grand Teleportation technique, Blayd used the shocking speed and precise perception to directly destroy Marko's use of the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Marko was a True God, and his Grand Teleportation technique was a hundred times more difficult than a Supreme Lord's.</p>

  <p>Upon catching Marko's gaze, Blayd revealed a mocking expression. "Use the most painful method..." he uttered. At the end of his sentence, all the muscles in his body doubled in size.</p>

  <p>The dim light shone even brighter from his arms, chest, and from even between his legs.</p>

  <p>"Those are the Eight Path Platforms..." Luo Zheng said faintly. When he saw the dim light, his eyes flashed. There was more than one way for body refining in the divine land, and making use of the Eight Path Platforms or the Night Divine Stars to refine the body was common. The method that Blayd used was similar to Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With yet another muffled sound, Blayd disappeared from where he was standing and instantly closed in on Marko.</p>

  <p>Marko became very clear on the idea that he was on the brink of death.</p>

  <p>After abandoning the Soul Searching Flag, he suddenly twisted his body in midair, trying his best to avoid Blayd's attack. "Pranav, Mateo! Come save me!" he shouted simultaneously.</p>

  <p>In this Evolutionary Universe, the only warriors who could truly help him now were Pranav and Mateo. Marko, on the other hand, had this lingering feeling that Pranav and Mateo might not be able to defeat Blayd.</p>

  <p>As he roared for help though, Blayd's large hand landed on Marko's neck, grabbing him and squeezing hard. Blayd was three times his usual size, and Marko looked like a skinny dwarf in comparison.</p>

  <p>"The War God Hall has a punishment, known as the Fighting Intent Penalty," Blayd said, as he stared at Marko.</p>

  <p>Marko had obviously heard of this punishment before. His pupils rapidly contracted as the fear on his face grew more obvious. "How dare you to treat me like this... I hope you know you'll regret it!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Before he could even finish speaking, an endless fighting intent surged from Blayd's body. Every True God had their own momentum, and the momentum of the members from the War God Hall was their fighting intent.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, streaks of fighting intent erupted from Blayd's body and pierced straight into Marko's mind, like hundreds of tiny, incredibly sharp knives.</p>

  <p>The redness on Marko's face immediately vanished, leaving nothing behind. He gritted his teeth as sweat began to pour from all pores on his body.</p>

  <p>Of course, the worst punishments were always aimed at the soul. Every time a streak of fighting intent drilled into Marko's mind, it broke apart his soul. When a True God's soul was directly attacked, it caused the most intense and true pain. In three seconds, Marko's soul had already been sliced by the sharp fighting intent thousands of times.</p>

  <p>This Fighting Intent Penalty's cutting method was extremely precise. In fact, it knew exactly how to keep its opponent suffering for as long as possible: by keeping the soul alive.</p>

  <p>A few seconds ago, Luo Zheng told Blayd to use the most painful method possible in order to end Marko's life. Blayd suddenly remembered the cruel method that had been used in the War God Hall...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Xun and Supreme Lord of Oracle were now looking straight at an extremely terrifying face.</p>

  <p>Marko's distorted face was filled with great pain. There was a burning desire in his eyes to die as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>This still remained punishment. Despite the fact that Marko looked like hell, there was no way Blayd would end his life that quickly.</p>

  <p>This painful process lasted for another full ninety seconds. After Marko had been cut for tens of thousands of times more, his pupils had expanded and reached their absolute limit. He slowly, but gradually died, as he trembled and shook like a leaf in the wind.</p>

  <p>Blayd casually tossed Marko's body aside with a snort and turned to look at Luo Zheng. "Are you satisfied now?" he asked flatly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only nodded his head. Although he believed that Blayd was more powerful than Marko, he didn't expect the entire process to have been so simple for Blayd. In the end, he had once again underestimated the group of people living in the dungeon.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure flashed, and he instantly moved to the Soul Searching Flag's side. Xun and Supreme Lord of Oracle were both still trapped in bands of light, motionlessly bound to the flag itself.</p>

  <p>At the moment, he grabbed the Soul Searching Flag and felt a powerful repulsive force coming at him. His head felt like it had been ripped open and the pain was unbearable.</p>

  <p>Although Xun couldn't move or speak, her face displayed pure worry. Her eyes looked lost.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Searching Flag is not an ordinary supreme primordial weapon.</p>

  <p>Although I destroyed seven True God Souls, there are still tens of thousands of souls trapped within." Blayd stepped forward and stretched out his hand in order to grab onto the Soul Searching Flag. With a sudden shake, the two light bands binding Xun and Supreme Lord of Oracle broke like chains, and the two women instantly regained their freedom.</p>

  <p>After completely getting rid of the light bands, Supreme Lord of Oracle lightly tapped her foot on the ground before cupping her hands and bowing towards Blayd. "Thank you for saving my life!" she praised.</p>

  <p>Blayd faintly smiled. "You'd be better off thanking him. I've only come on his orders. I had no intentions of helping you." There was no right or wrong in this universal war. Although he chose to help Luo Zheng, this didn't automatically mean that he chose to take a stand. Blayd had been imprisoned in the fairy palace by Bromley for a long time, and he didn't know what position the War God Hall had taken toward the two Holy Beings. In such a case, he was even less likely to position himself on one side or the other.</p>

  <p>When all was said and done, Blayd tossed the Soul Searching Flag to Luo Zheng. "This thing is also an extremely powerful treasure. I've already erased the imprint on it. It'll be of great use to you."</p>
