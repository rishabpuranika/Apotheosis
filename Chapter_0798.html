<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 798 Purple Star Grand Palace </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had first entered the fairy palace, he had found that everything in there was incomparably huge.</p>

  <p>The trees, the animals, the structures— everything in there was huge. Could it be that all immortals were giants?</p>

  <p>This was illogical.</p>

  <p>Humans were a huge race. Once their strength reached a certain point, they could pass through the void and enter the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Their bodies wouldn't change much even if they became immortals. Luo Zheng was still trying to solve this mystery.</p>

  <p>Waves of cold wind blew through the darkness as Luo Zheng cautiously approached the huge coffin. Dense, complex patterns were engraved on the coffin's outer surface.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to lift the lid of the coffin, but it did not budge, try as he might.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng circulated the power of dragon scales within his body. The forceful energy within him abruptly erupted, but the lid didn't move an inch.</p>

  <p>"Such a sturdy coffin!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, amazed.</p>

  <p>The explosion of his force could have overturned even a mountain, but it didn't affect the coffin in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no choice but to explore further.</p>

  <p>A gigantic natal chart appeared on the ground, with palm-sized words engraved on its surface. Zheng's eyes widened as he saw the golden engravings.</p>

  <p>"Six White, Seven Red, One White, this is..." Just as Luo Zheng recognized what it was, a weak voice sounded in the air.</p>

  <p>"This is the Purple Star Astrology. It can tell a person his fortune. Young man, since you've come here, go stand on it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng froze at the voice but quickly became wary. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Me? I am the owner of this tomb," the voice said. Luo Zheng heard a scratchy sound, like stone moving. He looked up to see a triangular stone board slowly moving away from the ceiling. A transparent crystal ball rolled out of the stone board and floated in the air.</p>

  <p>There was a black shadow in the crystal ball, like a human watching him.</p>

  <p>There were no eyeballs in his two eyes— only two empty, black eye sockets staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was nervous and bowed a little as he asked cautiously, "Are you Immortal Mist?"</p>

  <p>"You don't have to be so nervous. A dead man can't be counted as an immortal. Strictly speaking, I count as Immortal Mist's last words." The crystal ball floated silently for a while, and the voice then continued, "It took me a very long time and a great number of cultivation techniques to keep my remnant soul. If I had to wait another thousand years, the time sand would have been of no use.</p>

  <p>I mixed my remnant soul with the time sand so that I could have memories that lasted for thousands of years as I waited for a suitable person to appear.</p>

  <p>But after splitting my soul, I lost the right of reincarnation. Alas, this price!"</p>

  <p>Immortal Mist continued speaking indistinctly, but Luo Zheng was able to understand more than half of what was being said, and his wariness gradually faded.</p>

  <p>With such a weak remnant soul, it was impossible for Immortal Mist to take over Zheng's body and wipe out his soul. Not to mention that Zheng's soul had already reached the Fighting Soul Realm, and the two genuine dragons, the cyan and the red, were concealed deep within his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not know what the time sand was, but he did understand that in order to preserve his soul to this day, Immortal Mist had given up the right of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>People would normally have entered the path of reincarnation after their deaths.</p>

  <p>Giving up the right was equivalent to cutting off all avenues of retreat and permanently killing himself.</p>

  <p>Before immortals died, they had to experience the Five Aging Processes.</p>

  <p>They would die after, and there were no miraculous pills or medicines that could prolong their lives. Even their souls could not survive, and they had to enter the path of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>In order to leave behind a wisp of his residual soul to this day, Immortal Mist had paid a heavy price.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, but why are you doing this?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Waiting for someone," Immortal Mist said softly.</p>

  <p>"Waiting for whom?"</p>

  <p>"You…"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not surprised by this answer.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had already told him that his previous experience looked like a game. It was actually a Wheel of Fortune, and the goal was to pick out a powerful warrior who had the best luck.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the first one to pass the Wheel of Fortune, so it was obvious that he was the luckiest guy.</p>

  <p>"To be honest, your luck isn't that good," Immortal Mist said with a hint of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Not that good?" Luo Zheng said, confused. He felt otherwise, given that he had come this far.</p>

  <p>"You rolled the dice six times to get through the Wheel of Fortune that I had set up. According to my design, one has a one in three hundred chance to get a 'roll the dice again.' This means that out of 16.9 billion people, there is only one person who can do it. In other words, it's a one in 16.9 billion chance," Immortal Mist said plainly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rendered speechless by his words. According to what Immortal Mist was saying, he would have to invite 16.9 billion people, each of whom would give it a try. Among them, only one would be able to pass the Wheel of Fortune after rolling the dice six times like him.</p>

  <p>"However, I was looking for someone who could pass through the Wheel of Fortune in just one try," Immortal Mist continued.</p>

  <p>"Rolling the dice and continuously getting 'roll the dice again?' This probability..." Luo Zheng had nothing to say. This was probably not luck, right?</p>

  <p>This had to be a blessing of the heavens!</p>

  <p>"That's a one in 56 trillion chance," Immortal Mist said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's head was spinning at the large number. There were already tens of millions of people in Cloudy City. Oracle City and Magnolia City had a larger population than Cloudy City. But even if everyone in the entire Central Region was to roll the dice, it was still impossible for one person to meet Immortal Mist's requirements.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng roll his eyes, Immortal Mist smiled and said, "It's probably because my demands are too high."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," Luo Zheng agreed, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Stand there on the Purple Star Grand Palace. Let me gauge your luck,"</p>

  <p>Immortal Mist said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised a curious eyebrow as he asked the cyan dragon in his mind,</p>

  <p>"Does the human race have a way of calculating luck?"</p>

  <p>"Looks like it. I recommend that you do the same," the cyan dragon suggested.</p>

  <p>He had the same question in his heart.</p>

  <p>He had speculated that Luo Zheng had the fate to lead the world of chaos, but this was only his speculation. Neither the red dragon nor the cyan dragon knew how to estimate people's luck. Only their eldest brother knew the method.</p>

  <p>Since Immortal Mist could make calculations, the cyan dragon had naturally suggested it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and stepped onto the Purple Star Grand Palace. As he walked forward, he asked, "Cyan Dragon, even an immortal of the human race can calculate luck. You are a genuine dragon. Why can't you do that?"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was not clear on Immortal Mist's status in the Immortal World, he was certain of one thing— it was definitely incomparable to the cyan dragon's status in the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>There were only 49 genuine dragons in the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>But in the Upper World of the human race, immortals shouldn't be that rare.</p>

  <p>But the whole of the Upper World was still blurry and incomplete to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Until now, he had only been to the edge of the Genuine Dragon World, a small city that received warriors from the Lower World. And right now, Luo Zheng had too many unanswered questions in his mind.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon chuckled and said, "You underestimated the abilities of your human race. Among all the one hundred thousand great worlds, humans have occupied... Ha-ha! Let's talk about this later!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes. He then saw that the engravings of the palm-sized letters on the ground had begun to shine with a constantly circulating golden light. The light twisted into a fine line, and slithered back and forth.</p>

  <p>Some of the light rays hit Zheng's body, and then reflected onto a large character on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was in the middle of the light, didn't feel anything strange. The crystal ball floated before the Purple Star Grand Palace. The darkness inside the crystal ball rolled continuously as if it were calculating Zheng's luck.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the crystal ball suddenly trembled and fell heavily to the ground. A crack appeared on its surface, like a blooming flower.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked. He stared at the crystal ball and asked, concerned,</p>

  <p>"Immortal Mist, are you okay?"</p>

  <p>The black smoke in the crystal ball churned and finally took the faint form of a head. A weak yet surprised voice exclaimed, "You...you also have a token!"</p>
