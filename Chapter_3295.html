<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3295 A Strange Black-and-White Tree </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Blue Twin Stars floating in the darkness continued its descent. Then, the giant face of the ape appeared in the candlelight.</p>

  <p>Seeing the face of the ape up close, Elvinia felt a little scared. She took a few steps back and hid behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid." Zheng reassured her.</p>

  <p>The ape's face slowly came near Zheng. Afterwards, a huge gap appeared in it as it opened its mouth to speak. The voice that came out of it was a bit muffled.</p>

  <p>"Save... Him!"</p>

  <p>The words of the giant ape were quite unclear. It seemed like it wasn't used to speaking the language of humans. However, Zheng and Elvinia heard it clearly.</p>

  <p>"You want us to save him?" Zheng looked a bit hesitant.</p>

  <p>He only had limited treatment methods on the Other Shore. Furthermore, the three-eyed boy was from the Dark Region. Basically, his structure was very different from theirs.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh... Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>The giant ape covered the top of the hut with its enormous hands. It did a pressing-down motion meaning that it would crush the hut down. At the same time, its mouth opened and said, "If he dies, you'll die too!"</p>

  <p>If it did crush the hut with its hands, Elvinia and Zheng would absolutely die.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't have any chance to escape.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no other choice now but to save the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>"How will we be able to save him?" Elvinia asked in despair.</p>

  <p>Zheng carried plenty of soul pills, soul crystal, and even some special soul treasures inside his space ring. Unfortunately, these secret treasures could only save the Souls of Light, not the flesh body from the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Besides, his space ring wasn't with him.</p>

  <p>"I can give it a shot," Zheng replied but he wasn't entirely confident.</p>

  <p>Even though his body was unable to use Shade Stone on the Other Shore, it could still activate the cinnabar field. Thus, he might still be able to utilize the power of the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>The same thing could also be applied to the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that it sounded crazy to use a Godly Way to treat the creatures from the Dark Region, Zheng had run out of options.</p>

  <p>The huge ape did not seem smart but there was no doubt that it would do what it said. Simply put, if they managed to save the three-eyed boy's life, they would live. But if he died, they would die as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng squatted down, getting close to have a careful examination on the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>The boy's eyes were closed as he was lying motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out his hand and pressed his fingers against the boy's neck.</p>

  <p>As his skin came into contact with the boy's skin, he immediately felt a burning sensation.</p>

  <p>"Sizz..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's fingers were burned black. Meanwhile, the three-eyed boy's neck was also marked with black fingerprints.</p>

  <p>No matter what, the energy of the Dark Region would always melt that of the light.</p>

  <p>Zheng already predicted that kind of reaction.</p>

  <p>However, this was truly troublesome. It complicated things even more.</p>

  <p>The energy of the Life Godly Way would work completely against that of the Dark Region. There was only a faint possibility that they would be able to save him.</p>

  <p>At that point, the only thing Zheng could do was release the internal momentum from his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>A strong aura of life emanated from the Life Godly Way. This green aura swiftly curled into a wisp. As Zheng gently pointed at the three-eyed boy with his finger, it swept towards him.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>The green aura was able to heal the wounds of humans quickly and effectively.</p>

  <p>When it touched the body of three-eyed boy, however, it corroded his body instantaneously. It left black earthworm-like scars on his body.</p>

  <p>As he saw what happened, Zheng stopped at once.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? What happened?" Elvinia asked in a serious and worried tone.</p>

  <p>"He is from the Dark Region. All of our treatments are like fatal poison to him," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>The giant ape that hovered above the hut also saw what happened. Its huge eyes displayed a hint of sadness. It obviously had a deep relationship with the three-eyed boy. Now, it realized that there was a high chance the three-eyed boy would die. Naturally, this caused distress to it.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>A teardrop with the size of a huge wooden barrel fell from the giant ape's huge eye.</p>

  <p>This teardrop also belonged in the Dark Region. It quickly dissipated as it passed through the candlelight. Meanwhile, it continuously released energy.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this, Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he stood up and gestured at the giant ape. He asked loudly,</p>

  <p>"Why... are you not hurt even when you're in the candlelight?"</p>

  <p>Ordinary articles of the Dark Region would be immediately destroyed in the candlelight.</p>

  <p>However, the creatures of the Dark Region that Zheng had ever met were not quite scared of the candlelight. The truth behind this must be simple enough. Maybe it was just very easy to resist the candlelight in the Dark Region. Otherwise, the mere act of making candles would be courting death.</p>

  <p>"Hoo?" The giant ape looked confused.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment and then jumped up and pulled a long hair out of the giant ape's hairy hand. After that, he threw the hair into darkness and pulled it back from it. At the same time, he asked, "Why... are you not afraid of the light?"</p>

  <p>The giant ape stared back at Zheng and appeared in thought for a long time.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, it made a sound coming from its throat and showed an expression of understanding. The enormous face and pair of equally enormous hands hastily left the candlelight and dove into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Boom, Boom, Boom..." Its footsteps thundered loudly away from them.</p>

  <p>Watching the giant ape leave at such a brisk pace, Elvinia asked, "Do you think it really understood what you said?" She seemed concerned.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. Maybe..." Zheng answered. He was unsure of it either.</p>

  <p>Elvinia gazed at the three-eyed boy lying on the ground. And then she faced Zheng and said, "Let's run away now. In any case, that giant ape looks stupid.</p>

  <p>It won't be back in such a short time. Now that this boy has fainted, it is our chance to escape!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face displayed a hint of uncertainty as he gazed at the face of the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>It was true that now might be the best time to escape. In addition to that, he didn't have a deep relationship with the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was still difficult for Zheng not to save him. Moreover, he was already getting along with him for the past days.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the most crucial thing for Zheng right now was to determine how the creatures in the Dark Region were able to survive in the candlelight. He wondered whether it would be possible for him to come and go in the Dark Region whenever he wanted.</p>

  <p>After pondering for a while, Zheng told Elvinia, "The wooden bridge is very long. The giant ape might be returning already before we can pass through the bridge. We will still be caught by it."</p>

  <p>Elvinia searched Zheng's face and looked at him with a conflicted expression on her eyes.</p>

  <p>There were actually a lot of opportunities for escape they could have seized these past few months. But, Elvinia noticed that Zheng was reluctant to leave.</p>

  <p>In any event, Zheng could have escaped from the area of the hut as long as he lit candles. He could just run along the wooden bridge to leave here.</p>

  <p>She was aware of what Zheng was thinking. Despite that, she didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>For some unknown reason, she was not in a hurry to leave as well. Even if she was scared most of the time within the candlelight, she felt secured and calm somehow. She wasn't too anxious to run away.</p>

  <p>But it didn't matter if she wanted to leave now or not. The opportunity had already slipped through their fingers.</p>

  <p>Merely three minutes later, the giant ape had returned swiftly with its footsteps still causing the ground to tremble.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>Without warning, the giant ape inserted a large tree into the area shone by the candlelight.</p>

  <p>They estimated the height of the tree to be about ten feet. It had a normal shape but its colors were very peculiar.</p>

  <p>They noticed that the branches, leaves and fruits on the left side were jet black while those on the right side were snow-white. It was unbelievable that a tree produced leaves and fruits with two completely different colors.</p>

  <p>"Eat, not afraid of..." the ape said as it gestured towards the black fruit and touched it with its fingertip. "Light..."</p>
