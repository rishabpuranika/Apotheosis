<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2827 The Dark And Light Destruction Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>By now, Sword Chen had acquired almost all the power in the black water.</p>

  <p>It would be safe to assume that he was now the master of the black water, replacing the woman.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>His eyes were devoid of any emotions as he looked around, gently flipping his long sword. The internal momentum of Emotion Closing Divine Dao was mixed with a strong force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Sword Chen thrust out his sword horizontally as he shouted.</p>

  <p>As all of the force of primitive fear erupted, a ray of sword radiance spread out. With width stretching to tens of thousands of feet, it cut at the huge shadow at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Its brown sword radiance swept past the shadow's arms and body before it moved forward in the void.</p>

  <p>Feeling the power of the advancing sword radiance, all the Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods along the way were secretly frightened by this move.</p>

  <p>Was this a sword strike from a Demi-holy Being?</p>

  <p>For some reason, their experience during the trip to the Abyss Demon Region had greatly subverted their cognition about strength.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's sword had completely vanished the shadow now.</p>

  <p>Watching from afar, Nicholas couldn't hide his disappointment. He didn't pay much attention to this man all this while. Looking at him now, Nicholas remembered how he looked exactly like the dead bodies buried at the foot of the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>Why did this man suddenly appear out of nowhere? Why did it seem like he was able to fully borrow the woman's power?</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't change anything." Nicholas still regarded these people as insignificant as ants. After Sword Chen had employed all his strength to his strike, Nicholas was sure he could no longer resist.</p>

  <p>Stretching out his hand upward, Nicholas made another shadow appear to attack Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was now in the state of Emotion Closing. His face remained calm as he awaited the attack. Then, putting his sword horizontally, he started to launch the second strike.</p>

  <p>The woman watched with a displeased expression. She couldn't always rely on Sword Chen. Although the black water was filled with massive force of primitive fear, she knew that it would eventually be used up.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the woman heard a voice message. "Send me to Nicholas' side.</p>

  <p>I'll deal with him!"</p>

  <p>Turning her head, she found Luo Zheng from a distance, her eyes revealing a puzzled expression. She responded, "But he can see the future. Even if I send you there, he can discover you immediately. How can you deal with him?"</p>

  <p>"That may not be the case," Luo Zheng answered, a smile lingering in his lips.</p>

  <p>"Just do as I say."</p>

  <p>The woman was stunned upon hearing Luo Zheng's confident reply. However, she still followed his request, asking Samuel's clone to act immediately.</p>

  <p>After being slapped by the shadow, Samuel's clone had been badly injured.</p>

  <p>However, being a Holy Being, he could control the Spear of Supreme Harmony at will.</p>

  <p>As he pointed the Spear of Supreme Harmony at Luo Zheng, a space channel had covered Luo Zheng and sent him to Nicholas' side.</p>

  <p>With his full concentration, Luo Zheng had activated the jade seal in his hand.</p>

  <p>Driven by the jade seal, all the bugs started to move, erasing 9 seconds from the divine land.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nicholas had also noticed the movements made by Samuel's clone. As he saw that he raised his spear horizontally, a strange expression flashed in his eyes even before he got shocked.</p>

  <p>What happened? The future suddenly disappeared!</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had used the jade seal to erase the next few seconds, Nicholas went blind on what would happen.</p>

  <p>However, the space channel had already been created, so Luo Zheng managed to appear behind Nicholas unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Nicholas tried to respond quickly.</p>

  <p>Having seen Luo Zheng use the jade seal before, he knew what Luo Zheng had done the moment the future had gone blank.</p>

  <p>With the sound coming from behind him, Nicholas was prompted to turn around instinctively.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish!</p>

  <p>A line of red lotuses swept over his head.</p>

  <p>Nicholas fell. The red lotuses followed him and quickly grew around him.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he couldn't avoid them, Nicholas clenched his teeth and stretched out his hand. Soon, a cloth bag appeared. He opened it wide, spreading strong internal momentum and covering one end of the red lotuses.</p>

  <p>It was true that the red lotuses could transform all the energies, but they could do nothing to time. After he was able to cover all the red lotuses at the forefront, they were bound by time and couldn't continue to extend down.</p>

  <p>With the help of the bag, Nicholas managed to escape.</p>

  <p>However, the red lotuses continued to grow fast and intertwine. Even though Nicholas' cloth bag had blocked the first few vines, the others were still able to quickly extend down, trapping him into a bigger cage.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas originally thought that he was invincible, having employed the Dark Light World Transformation composed of three theurgies. The first one was called the Dark Light Shadow, which was powerful and extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The Dark Light Shadow would have allowed him to get rid of his opponents, but he hadn't expected the crisis to come. In anger, he gently opened his hands, making the huge Eight Diagrams disk above the void spin again.</p>

  <p>Each time he used one token of the Dark Light World Transformation, he would get double damage. Since the Dark Light Shadow was unable to stop Luo Zheng, Nicholas tried to use the second token.</p>

  <p>"Dark and Light Destruction Sword!"</p>

  <p>As the huge Eight Diagrams disk overhead slowly rotated, the aura that it emitted became weaker. Shortly after, a small Eight Diagrams disk appeared in Nicholas' hand.</p>

  <p>It was the aura of the big Eight Diagrams disk but now gathered in the small one.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>On the basis of the Eight Diagrams disk, a long black and white sword formed.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Lifting the black and white sword, Nicholas aimed it towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light Destruction Sword could stop the reincarnation of life and death, giving full play to the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos. Even if the red lotuses could light all the energies, Nicholas was confident that his sword could cut them off.</p>

  <p>Before Nicholas launched his attack, Luo Zheng's expression changed slightly.</p>

  <p>Being able to read Nicholas' memory, he saw that the red lotuses couldn't burn Nicholas' black and white sword. As Nicholas hacked his long sword down, he had cut off all the red lotuses, turning them into flames.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a few moments, what Luo Zheng saw really happened.</p>

  <p>Waving his long two-colored sword, Nicholas cut off all the red lotuses, and then rushed to directly attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Now, let's see how you block my strike!" Nicholas said coldly.</p>

  <p>He had paid a heavy price to get the sword. He was determined to get back at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light Destruction Sword could stop birth and death, destroying everything. No one, not even Luo Zheng, could resist his sword attack.</p>

  <p>Right after Nicholas' banter, a crisp sound echoed.</p>

  <p>Holding his long sword horizontally, Luo Zheng stood and blocked Nicholas' sword.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Dark and Light Destruction Sword was powerful enough to chop the red lotuses off, but it could not damage the Shadow Bearing Sword that Harper had given to Luo Zheng.</p>
