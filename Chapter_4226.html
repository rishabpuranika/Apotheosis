<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The purple energy balls were falling down slowly from above. It was as if a stage on the Other Shore was sluggishly crumbling after it collapsed.</p>

  <p>As the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw this, he quickly stretched out his hand and flicked two golden rings towards Fuxi and Gonggong. The rings that emitted golden lights darted and stopped above their heads.</p>

  <p>"You three, leave now while there's still time?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had a Descending Ring with her, so she could descend to the primitive land any time.</p>

  <p>"Then, what about you?" the Snake Goddess asked as she raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference whether I leave or not." the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a bitter smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He clearly knew that everything and everyone was going to be destroyed eventually. There was no point in prolonging the suffering and needless struggles.</p>

  <p>However, deep inside him, all of his frustrations were built up. He couldn't accept that everything was just going to end this way.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew how difficult it was for him to reach this certain step.</p>

  <p>However, he had failed in the last one, and now, he felt very much dead inside.</p>

  <p>Among them, Gonggong was the first one who activated the Descending Ring. After the ring emitted luminous lights, his body trembled, but his body still stayed right where he was.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? I can't leave?" Gonggong's voice trembled as he realized this. Among the human heroes, he had always been the most careful and cautious one. He was relatively afraid of death.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was kind of surprised when he saw what happened to Gonggong, so he also activated the Descending Ring given to him.</p>

  <p>However, just as what happened to Gonggong, he also failed to leave.</p>

  <p>Then, the Snake Goddess gave it a try, but the result was just the same.</p>

  <p>A bitter and helpless smile appeared on her face as she looked at Luo Zheng in the distance. "If we can't leave the Other Shore, then I'm afraid that it's also the same for Luo Zheng? "</p>

  <p>At the same moment, Luo Zheng was also quietly looking at the sky. His expression was as calm as ever.</p>

  <p>He had just tried to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune to leave the Jade Pure Realm, but it didn't have any effect. It was as if he had been showered with the Soul Interdicting Water, making it impossible to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Will the primitive land also collapse if I die?" Luo Zheng asked the ancestry-level bloodline with a hint of hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the ancestry-level bloodline replied briefly.</p>

  <p>Although the current primitive land was built with the aid of the ancestry-level bloodline, Luo Zheng was still its owner, making him indispensable to it.</p>

  <p>"What about you? What will happen to you after?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Me? I will have no choice but to leave the primitive land," the ancestry-level bloodline answered.</p>

  <p>"I see. Can you please take care of my family for me?" Luo Zheng asked with a slightly trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"Sure. I will."</p>

  <p>Actually, the result would still be the same whether the ancestry-level bloodline took care of them or not. Even Luo Zheng knew this.</p>

  <p>The downgrade had already begun. It meant that the entire chaos would soon be under the control of the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng remembered his loved ones? Dorothy, Yudie, Margaret, Xun...</p>

  <p>Their beautiful faces appeared in front of Luo Zheng as if he was hallucinating.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he suddenly felt a deep sense of regret.</p>

  <p>From the moment he knew them, his life turned out like a chess piece that was being constantly pushed, running around all the time. From the Eastern Region to the universe, from the divine land to the Source World, he was restlessly going here and there. He rarely paused and took the time to be with the most important people in his life.</p>

  <p>If he had only known that this would be the ending, he thought that he would have rather chosen to be a mere mortal and spend the rest of his life with them in peace.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter what mission he had to accomplish, nor would he care about the end of the chaos or the downgrade.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, he remembered Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>He and Ziya were still in the main world at this time.</p>

  <p>"If the humanoid creature completes the downgrade, what will happen to Luo Nian and Ziya who stay in the main world?" Luo Zheng asked out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>"They will also die," the ancestry-level bloodline answered with all honesty.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but fall silent upon hearing this.</p>

  <p>Right now, the purple energy balls that were falling were already getting closer and closer to them. Ten thousand feet, a thousand feet, five hundred feet?</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The altar in the distance was the first one to be eroded by the purple energy balls.</p>

  <p>Before Fuxi got erased by the purple energy balls, he waved at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess just knelt on the ground and closed her captivating eyes.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven just stood still as he awaited his impending doom.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Gonggong continued to struggle. He turned into a pool of water and flowed down from the altar, seeping into the ground.</p>

  <p>Several others were also unwilling to give up and desperately climbed down from the altar, trying to buy themselves a few more minutes or seconds to survive. At the same time, many people just stayed where they were and waited for what was going to happen.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The purple energy balls had finally reached the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven. They all quickly melted and disappeared without a trace within the energy balls.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the altar where they were standing also collapsed.</p>

  <p>The overbearing power of the energy balls eroded the altar layer by layer.</p>

  <p>At this point, these energy balls were only just about ten feet above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, a space fluctuation occurred directly behind him.</p>

  <p>With a surprised look on his face, he quickly turned and saw a door appeared.</p>

  <p>"This door?" Luo Zheng somehow regained his senses as his eyes widened.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The door suddenly sprang open.</p>

  <p>Then, a pair of huge fluffy hands stretched out from the door and hurriedly grabbed and pulled Luo Zheng in.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng was able to enter the door, it closed shut and disappeared in the space.</p>

  <p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye, but this still didn't go unnoticed in the eyes of the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature expressed a trace of confusion in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"He still had a backup plan for escape at this point?</p>

  <p>Well, it doesn't matter. No matter how much he struggles, he can only exist for a few more days."</p>

  <p>To be honest, the humanoid creature didn't actually care if Luo Zheng died right away or was still able to escape. In his mind, he clearly knew that no one would get away from the fate of fading away soon.</p>

  <p>From the very moment that he got total control of the heavy sword, the ending had been decided. There was no possibility of anyone overturning the situation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the door where Luo Zheng was pulled into, two rows of long-haired monsters could be seen standing on both sides of the passageway.</p>

  <p>All of them focused their gazes on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a hunch when he first saw the door, but he was a little unsure.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Where am I?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked with a straight face.</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing but silence, and no one answered him.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng heard that footsteps were coming from the end of the passageway.</p>

  <p>As the footsteps drew nearer and nearer, a figure slowly appeared from the darkness. It was Dorothy, whom he hadn't seen in a long while.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't very surprised upon seeing her face because he had an earlier suspicion when the door appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>But still, he couldn't hide the joy and excitement as he saw her with his eyes.</p>

  <p>Dorothy clenched her fists tightly to control her emotions. About half a minute passed before she was able to answer Luo Zheng's question. "These creatures are from the Bold Conjecture House of the Human Spirit Sect."</p>

  <p>"The Bold Conjecture House? I see?" Luo Zheng nodded, immediately understanding the meaning behind her words.</p>

  <p>He had heard of the name of this house so many times. It could be said that its members were the founders of the entire Human Spirit Sect, and were also known as the smartest group of people within the sect. Even Elder Xue, who helped him obtain the ancestry-level bloodline, came from the Bold Conjecture House.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng finished speaking, Dorothy wasn't able to hold her emotions anymore, and suddenly rushed and threw herself in Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry, I came in too late. We might have the chance to avoid all this," she said in a muffled voice as she cried on Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately understood when Dorothy said that she was late, but for a moment, he was a bit reluctant to realize what "chance" she was pertaining to. Then he smiled bitterly and said, "It's indeed a little late, but even if you came a bit earlier, I'm afraid that nothing would have changed."</p>

  <p>"Why? What do you mean?" Dorothy asked with a puzzled expression as she wiped her tears.</p>

  <p>"Because even if you were able to wake Kincaid up, he wouldn't be able to resist such an existence," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>"Master Kincaid is the strongest warrior in the Human Spirit Sect. If he woke up, you'll see that he would be much stronger than that guy!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. Master Kincaid is our last hope. We must find him at once!" several long-haired monsters retorted and were convinced that Kincaid was the answer to surpass this overwhelming crisis.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng just gently smiled and said, "Even if Master Kincaid used that sword, he might not be as powerful as me."</p>

  <p>"How can you even be sure about that?" one of the long-haired monsters reacted in a cynical tone.</p>

  <p>"How?" Luo Zheng thought for a moment and said, "Because Elder Xue helped me obtain the ancestry-level bloodline. I'm the only one who could unleash the power of that sword to the fullest."</p>

  <p>"W-what?!"</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>"You mean that you have the ancestry-level bloodline within your body?"</p>

  <p>The long-haired monsters were all stunned. That was the only time that they remembered Elder Xue. He left the Bold Conjecture House a long time ago before he headed for the Deep Space.</p>
