<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'It's the Shadow Creature!'</p>

  <p>Suddenly Luo Zheng's head throbbed.</p>

  <p>The black hook seemed to be made from the bones of some animal and it was incredibly fast. It charged straight at Luo Luo Zheng, trying to drag him into the space crack.</p>

  <p>But he was quick to react. Coincidentally, a gale swept over him. He immediately followed the gale and floated slightly in the air. His body suddenly drifted a couple of feet horizontally and dodged the hook just in time!</p>

  <p>The black hook missed its target and continued hovering in the air. Then it actually turned around and chased after Luo Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>"Cloud-chasing Skill!"</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng afford to stop?</p>

  <p>Even the seven Spirit Supreme Realm masters of the Celestial Position had fled for their lives in the face of the Shadow Creature. If he were to get dragged into this crack, he would be doomed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The storm contained a strong Wind Law. As he employed the Cloud-chasing Skill, the forceful energy within his body also erupted, giving Luo Luo Zheng an amazing boost. His speed reached its peak.</p>

  <p>However, the black hook too sped up as it chased him. It seemed determined not to give up until it caught Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Why can't I escape it?" Luo Zheng's perception told him that the black hook was moving faster and getting closer to him. His expression darkened.</p>

  <p>When the black hook was only a dozen feet away from him, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly turned around mid-flight, and the power within his body shot out crazily. If he could not escape it, he could at least try his best to get out. This was what was on his mind.</p>

  <p>However, there was a dramatic turn of events at this point. As Luo Luo Zheng was focusing on fleeing, the hook suddenly straightened up. Although the tip of the hook was still emitting rays of cold light, it paused and couldn't move from its spot at all?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes glistened as a smile appeared on his face. The hook wasn't long enough to reach him.</p>

  <p>This hook was released by the Shadow Creature from the back side of the world. The hook could leave the back of the world, but the Shadow Creature couldn't.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, the black hook retracted with a whoosh. It seemed as if the Shadow Creature had given up.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't dare to drop his guard. The Shadow Creatures seemed to be active on the back side of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. He was not sure what these creatures wanted to do with him, but it would definitely not be a wise decision to stay here. So he immediately sped away towards Central Region.</p>

  <p>Indeed, just as Luo Luo Zheng had guessed, space cracks appeared now and then and hooks emerged from them to chase after Luo Luo Zheng on the way back too.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng managed to escape in time when the space cracks appeared and the hooks stretched out. He had never been caught by any hook in his mad dash.</p>

  <p>This hot pursuit continued all the way to the edge of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, only then did the Shadow Creatures give up.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt strange that the Shadow Creatures suddenly gave up chasing him. Logically speaking, there was no limit to the range of movement of the Shadow Creatures. Even if they had reached the Central Region, they would still be able to hunt him down in the shadows, but why would they suddenly stop there?</p>

  <p>Of course, it was a good thing for Luo Luo Zheng. He heaved a sigh of relief. If those creatures continued to follow him, then even if Luo Luo Zheng entered the Cloud Hall, they would still be able to hunt him down in the shadows.</p>

  <p>Then never would there be days of peace for him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't figure out why these creatures suddenly stopped chasing him.</p>

  <p>Could it be? that there was something they were afraid of in the Central Region?</p>

  <p>This was impossible. Luo Luo Zheng immediately disregarded this idea. It was true that there were many dangerous areas in the Central Region, but once one reached the Life and Death Realm, one could enter and exit the land freely. For example, although the Dreamy Swampland was dangerous and mysterious for ordinary martial artists, it wasn't a scary place for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the way back to the Cloud Hall, Luo Luo Zheng maintained vigilant and various conjectures came to his mind. After some thought, Luo Luo Zheng came up with a reasonable conjecture. Probably in the back of the Central Region there existed some powerful being! The Shadow Creatures were extremely fearful of this powerful being, so they did not dare to invade the back of the Central Region!</p>

  <p>But what was on the back of the Central Region?</p>

  <p>Curiosity arose in his heart. With his current strength, he could forcibly tear open space and enter the back of the Central Region to figure out the mystery.</p>

  <p>However, after some thought, he gave up on the idea.</p>

  <p>No matter what was on the back side of the Central Region, it was not something he could afford to offend. At the very least, the powerful being had been in the Central Region for a long time, and it had never appeared in the history of the Central Region. So Luo Luo Zheng decided that he'd better not explore the back side of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that his luck was good, but if he sought death himself, he would die no matter how strong his luck was!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had returned to the Cloud Hall after obtaining the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. In addition to practicing the Primal Chaos Technique, he also needed to study the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. Its simplest and crudest use was to smash people.</p>

  <p>If he refined a common mountain and used it to attack people, a powerful Soul Sea Realm master would be able to smash it with one punch.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had a Magnetic Sacred Mountain and it was not so easily blocked. Of course, smashing people was just its simplest function. One could extract Magnetic Sacred Light from the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, which had the power of the five elements that had evolved over countless years in the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. It could be absorbed and used by the cultivator. The Myriad Manifestations of Nature stated that the Magnetic Sacred Light could suppress the power of all five elements in this world.</p>

  <p>After studying the Magnetic Sacred Mountain for two months, one early morning, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt a tremor in his soul.</p>

  <p>An extremely joyful feeling arose from the depths of his soul. It was the joy that came from the world's will!</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who was still in the midst of cultivating, had a strange expression on his face. He immediately closed his eyes, and raised his eyebrows, and remarked, "The flying passage has been repaired!"</p>

  <p>He didn't know who had repaired it. Perhaps it was the Celestial Position, or the human race. According to what the old man from the Celestial Position had explained, the Celestial Position had probably reached a truce with the human race. At the very least, Derek would not look for trouble with the Celestial Position. As for who was responsible or taking the Evil Dragon from the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect the flying passage to be repaired in such a short period of time?</p>

  <p>Other than Luo Luo Zheng who himself had felt great joy, all the creatures below the Soul Sea Realm were indifferent in the great world.</p>

  <p>Life and Death Realm masters weren't strong enough to make the great world repel them. They were unable to ascend, so they didn't care if the flying passage was repaired or not.</p>

  <p>Contrarily, for the mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, it was big news!</p>

  <p>The powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm in the four divine kingdoms immediately felt an invisible expulsion force being exerted on their bodies!</p>

  <p>It was trying to squeeze them out of their plane!</p>

  <p>The powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm were ecstatic. Even War Emperor York and War King Wind were thrilled.</p>

  <p>They had dreamed of the day they could ascend to the Upper World. The appearance of this mighty force was great news for them.</p>

  <p>Five minutes after the repelling force appeared, a bright silver light erupted from the Harlen Divine Kingdom and shot up towards the sky.</p>

  <p>"Damn! Who is this guy that is flying away? Why the hell he is in such a mad rush?" Turner cursed as he stood watching this scene from the palace of the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm in the four divine kingdoms had been waiting for this moment for countless years. No matter how anxious everyone was, they couldn't risk ascending recklessly!</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms had a good relationship with each other, and it was the strength of each divine kingdom that maintained the peace among them. If all the Soul Sea Realm masters in the Harlen Divine Kingdom ascended to the Upper World and only Turner was left, how could the divine kingdom continue its reign?</p>

  <p>It was a crisis situation, so Turner immediately summoned all the Soul Sea Realm masters in the Harlen Divine Kingdom to the palace.</p>

  <p>The problem was that all the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm wanted to ascend to the Upper World. They could have immediately ascended to the Upper World after entering the Soul Sea Realm, but the truth was that most of them had been stuck at the Soul Sea Realm for countless years with no scope of ascending. Now they were in a mad rush to ascend to the Upper World and nobody could stop them, not even Turner!</p>

  <p>'Everyone recognizes you as the ruler of the divine kingdom, and once I ascend to the Upper World, I might still regard you as my king for the sake of our old friendship. But if you think you can stop me from ascending to the Upper World, then you must be dreaming!' Most of the Soul Sea Realm masters in the Harlen Divine Kingdom had this same thought in their minds.</p>
