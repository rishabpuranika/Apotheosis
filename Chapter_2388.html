<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2388 Spar With Xun </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's expression spelled mischief.</p>

  <p>Looking at the kid made Zheng's heart sigh. Compared to Geoffrey's carefree life now, when Zheng was sixteen years old, the responsibilities he carried weighed so heavily on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>It was also the pressure put on by his father that made the burden so much as he moved on.</p>

  <p>Zheng assumed that Geoffrey was not an integral part in his father's plan, so Zheng hoped that he could grow up happily.</p>

  <p>"Um?" Joy's smile became wider. "What do you want? If I have what you want, I will give it to you."</p>

  <p>"I want a spear!" Geoffrey said excitedly.</p>

  <p>Zheng scrunched his nose..</p>

  <p>"A spear?"</p>

  <p>Yudie smiled lightly. "Geoffrey is really obsessed with practicing spear techniques. He often goes to the training tower to spar with Xun."</p>

  <p>"He can spar with Xun?" That was new.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng had never seen Geoffrey ever show any talent or inclination in martial arts. Even now, his cultivation had just reached the Internal Elixir Realm. There was still a long way to go before he could reach the Life and Death Realm and form his Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng didn't have much resources. He had to rely on himself for everything.</p>

  <p>However, Yudie and the rest of his family had already made preparations before they entered the fairy palace. These resources in the fairy palace were also at their disposal, so they didn't need to worry about it any longer Geoffrey's cultivation speed was rather slow.</p>

  <p>Yudie smiled at him again. "It's just a spar."</p>

  <p>"Even if it's only a spar, how could he spar with Xun?" Zheng asked, eyes trained at Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>While Xun's spear technique was not complicated, it was extremely terrifying. He found it hard to imagine how the two sparred with each other.</p>

  <p>"Dad, you're always underestimating me!" Geoffrey scowled and glared at Zheng. "If it isn't for the fact that Aunt Xun's spear is too good, I might have been able to win against her. I've even asked Livingston to make a few spears for me, but they are still not as good as the one Aunt Xun has!"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised an eyebrow. "Really?"</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear Xun wielded was the sacred object of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>No matter how excellent the spears refined by Livingston were, it would still be difficult for them to match Xun's Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey crossed his arms and huffed but said no more.</p>

  <p>Beside them, Joy cleared her throat. "I don't use weapons. I have some spears, but..."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she gently waved her hand, and seven spears appeared.</p>

  <p>With a flick of her wrist, purple mist curled around them and lifted the spears in the air.</p>

  <p>Demi-holy Beings were usually very rich and owned many treasures.</p>

  <p>The spears Joy had were all quality supreme primordial weapons, and even the aura coming off of their tips was very strong.</p>

  <p>Although Yudie, Imogen, Aura and Freya didn't use spears, all of them looked fervently at the floating weapons. The four of them hoped Geoffrey would choose a good spear.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that the weight of these spears is not what Geoffrey can handle," added Joy.</p>

  <p>Things in the divine land were about ten times heavier than things in the universes. Proving godly warriors in the divine land could barely use these spears, so it was doubtful that Geoffrey who was merely at the Internal Elixir Realm could.</p>

  <p>Then Joy waved her hand again and a crystal blue spear appeared in front of everyone. She nudged the spear lightly and it slowly flew towards Geoffrey. "This Space Spear weighs nothing at all so Geoffrey should be able to use it. However, because it doesn't weigh anything, you wouldn't feel anything when you hold it. It will take quite some time to get used to it!"</p>

  <p>Looking at the long spear slowly approaching him, Geoffrey grabbed it in his hand.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, the light long spear swung like a windmill, and as the tip of the spear moved, it almost tore the surrounding space apart.</p>

  <p>"Okay! Deal! Now you can have a look at my Truth of Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>With a smile, Geoffrey jogged out of the side hall with his spear.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to Aunt Xun's place." As Joy was going to check the Truth of Godly Way, all the other people left the side hall.</p>

  <p>"By the way, where would Geoffrey go to spar with Xun on spear art? Why haven't I seen her?" asked Zheng after a while. This time after Zheng returned, he felt strange that he hadn't seen Xun.</p>

  <p>"She's cultivating in the training tower," Yudie replied, glancing at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whether it was Aura, Yudie, or Xun, they all had their own temperament. All of them had been waiting for Zheng to return, and their relationship was harmonious.</p>

  <p>But some minor conflicts were still unavoidable. It was impossible for them to get along with each other like best friends all the time.</p>

  <p>However, Freya was an exception and had a very good relationship with Imogen, Yudie, and Aura.</p>

  <p>Even Geoffrey was closest to Freya.</p>

  <p>As for Xun, she was a low-key kind of woman in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>She spent most of her time in the training tower. Occasionally, she would come out to exchange a few words with others, only to ask whether Zheng had returned before returning to the training tower.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had always been very curious about Xun. By chance, he had barged into the training tower and saw Xun brandishing her spear like a cyan dragon surging out of the sea. Driven by curiosity, he developed a little interest in the weapon. As a result, although he had no interest in martial arts, he began to practice spears.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng opened the door of the training tower, a whistling sound met his ears.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Xun, I got a good spear today. It won't be damaged if I spar with you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng watched Geoffrey wave the Space Spear vigorously and run to the other side.</p>

  <p>Over there, a tall and slim figure waved the Saint Killing Spear and took a turn. In an instant, her spear had blocked Geoffrey's spear in the air.</p>

  <p>The two spears collided with each other several times as the two sparred, causing metallic sound that echoed on the first floor of the training tower.</p>

  <p>"How is Geoffrey's spear skill?"</p>

  <p>Yudie secretly grabbed Zheng's arm with her fair-skinned hand and laughed.</p>

  <p>"His understanding of spear intent is not bad." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Even as Xun significantly lowered her cultivation level when sparring with Geoffrey, and she could still suppress Geoffrey just by using martial skills, all of Geoffrey's moves were praiseworthy and far beyond Zheng's expectations.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>As the spears collided, Geoffrey felt very proud. "This spear won't be destroyed! Ha-ha! This spear should be more powerful than Aunt Xun's spear!"</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey was just a child, and his cultivation was nothing remarkable, Xun took everything she did seriously. As she focused on sparring with Geoffrey, she paid no attention to the door at all. "How could it be that Livingston's weapon refining skills have improved so fast?" she asked curiously. "This spear... was not refined by him, was it?"</p>

  <p>Livingston had made several spears for Geoffrey in the past but Geoffrey was unable to protect the spears with his life vitality. All of them broke shortly after Geoffrey used them against Xun.</p>

  <p>As Geoffrey casually thrust his spear into the air, it made a whistling noise as if the air was being pierced through!</p>

  <p>This was the divine land and even Xun couldn't have achieved this.</p>

  <p>However, Geoffrey did that easily. The spear in his hand was by no means an ordinary weapon. It was even much stronger than the Saint Killing Spear in Xun's hand.</p>

  <p>"No way can he make such a weapon," snorted Geoffrey.. "Master Joy gave it to me! Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Xun was taken aback. "Joy? Someone came to the fairy palace?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Geoffrey nodded. "My father brought her!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Xun looked towards the door subconsciously. She was not in the mood to spar with Geoffrey anymore.</p>

  <p>As if on cue, Xun caught sight of Zheng by the door.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Geoffrey had already hit out with his spear and it was too late for him to take it back.</p>

  <p>Xun pursed her lips. Without looking, she flipped her hand and grabbed the tip of the Space Spear. With a pull, the Space Spear flew away from Geoffrey's hand. It shot towards one side and nailed itself on the wall with a clang.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Xun, you're cheating..." Geoffrey's words fell on deaf ears as Xun charged at Zheng at full speed.</p>
