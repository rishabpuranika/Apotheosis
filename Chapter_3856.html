<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Land of Ancient Flesh was a whole large chunk of flesh located in the far south of the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>Though no one knew who explored the Land of Ancient Flesh first, it could be assumed that it was easy to break into the place in the beginning.</p>

  <p>However, after someone dug into the land once, no pure physical force could work on it anymore. Because of this, the very first mark on the ground could still be seen to this very day.</p>

  <p>After one used fire to melt the Land of Ancient Flesh, they found that it would only successfully melt off a small piece. Since then, the Land of Ancient Flesh grew immune to the fire, and no longer feared any flames.</p>

  <p>All of these failed attempts led to the conclusion that methods and attempts only worked once when used on the Land of Ancient Flesh.</p>

  <p>This large chunk of flesh seemed to have developed this rare evolutionary ability, which worked very well to its advantage.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Land of Ancient Flesh had endured so many attacks that it was basically unstoppable. The flesh feared nothing now.</p>

  <p>Many people had attempted to break it, including the Snake Goddess and Fuxi and others. However, they failed to cause even a dent in the Land of Ancient Flesh.</p>

  <p>Just now, the Snake Goddess used her shadow and corroded the body of the Black Ship's captain. The captain didn't dodge because he wanted to adapt to the energy beams from the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>After the captain experienced the power of the beams, the shadow of Snake Goddess became an ineffective attack to the black ships.</p>

  <p>It was in this moment that the Snake Goddess realized that this resistance possibly had something to do with the Land of Ancient Flesh.</p>

  <p>Because of the flesh's extraordinary characteristic, many people attempted to obtain the land to use its powers. However, it was due to this evolutionary characteristic alone that no one succeeded.</p>

  <p>In theory, the Land of Ancient Flesh could not be sliced, separated, much less be merged with anyone. If this was so, how did the captain of the Black Ship merge himself with such an incredible Other Shore Token?</p>

  <p>"You are quite smart to have understood it so quickly," the captain smirked,</p>

  <p>"Please do aboard the ship and stay there for a while."</p>

  <p>As soon as the captain finished speaking, the black ship closest in proximity to the Snake Goddess suddenly swooped down in her direction.</p>

  <p>Just then, Snake Goddess tapped her toes in the air and flew backward rapidly, her long dress flowing gracefully in the air along with her.</p>

  <p>Normally, the Snake Goddess's speed should have been enough for her to escape, but the black ship suddenly produced a space fluctuation. Within a second, the Snake Goddess noticed the light dimmed around her, and she was already within the black ship.</p>

  <p>It was a gloomy, quiet cabin and no matter how much the ship sped up, jolted or swayed, the people inside it were stable and unbothered.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>In an attempt to leave, the Snake Goddess tried to use the Grand Teleportation and exit.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the space channel appeared and opened up, it vanished just as quickly.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the captain of the Black Ship already had used the power of space to contain her earlier. Because the ship had evolved, the power of space was unusable inside it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Just then, the swords that hung on the wooden wall behind the Snake Goddess shook and vibrated. Suddenly, they shot up and pointed straight at her.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>It was as if a hidden person controlled the short swords and aimed towards the Snake Goddess. Though the swords were short, they had immense power within them.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's body dodged and avoided the short swords. However, the nearby mast against the wall spun three hundred and sixty degrees and fell towards her.</p>

  <p>Caught off guard, all the Snake Goddess could do was raise her arms to block it.</p>

  <p>With a loud bang, she was sent right into a wall. When her body collided with the wall, numerous spears hovered at the end of the passageway, ready to shoot her.</p>

  <p>It seemed that everything in the black ship was a part of the captain - and they were all more or less fatal.</p>

  <p>Initially, Mahoney stood by and watched the fight from a distance.</p>

  <p>However, when she saw that the Snake Goddess was devoured by the black ship, a feeling of apprehension slowly consumed her.</p>

  <p>She had originally discussed with the captain of the Black Ship that they were going to join forces to deal with the Snake Goddess. As of the moment, this didn't seem like the case.</p>

  <p>It suddenly occurred to her that she and the captain were on opposing sides.</p>

  <p>A strong sense of urgency rose within her, but just as she was about to use the Grand Teleportation, a black ship swooped down and engulfed her within a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Once the two warriors of the Eternal Realm were trapped, a third black ship descended towards Divine Farmer this time.</p>

  <p>Since Fuxi and Yellow Thearch were still at war against one another, the captain figured that if he trapped the Divine Farmer, he could easily take Zheng away.</p>

  <p>For the captain, his plan was fool proof. This was going to be too easy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Divine Farmer chased after the Invisible Ship with the Divine Farmer Ruler gripped in his hand.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Edith concentrated on controlling the Invisible Ship to dodge Divine Farmer, but to no avail. Anywhere she went, Divine Farmer appeared right after.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A few moments later, both the Invisible Ship and Divine Farmer appeared in the north corner of the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>Edith didn't have enough time to control the ship to dodge this time.</p>

  <p>"Ghoul Substitute!"</p>

  <p>Shera stretched out her arms and gripped hard, as if she held onto thin, invisible threads. All of a sudden, a huge monster that was made up of corpses hovered right above the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>The ghoul had cost Shera years to piece together, so it possessed extremely strong defensive power.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how powerful a ghoul was, it would never be able to resist a single blow from Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Just like that, the huge ghoul was sliced in half by the ruler, and it spewed green blood left and right.</p>

  <p>As Shera saw her ghoul get killed in one strike, her eyes filled up with sadness. However, this did not mean the efforts were useless. Because the ghoul blocked the ruler, it gave Edith the window to teleport away.</p>

  <p>"We can't go on like this. How about I go out and stop him? Edith, you must take everyone away," the brass man spoke out.</p>

  <p>The people of the Black Ship were not naturally a united group in normal times. After all, they had already been tainted as evil in the Source World, and each one of them had done repulsive things in the past.</p>

  <p>However, when it came to sacrifice and saving their members, they didn't hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>After they lived on the Black Ship for so long, they eventually became a part of it.</p>

  <p>"You can't stop him all by yourself," Shera snapped back.</p>

  <p>"No, but at least I can buy you some time." Just then, the surface of the brass man's body turned yellow and solid like an iron wall. Without asking for any help, he prepared to sacrifice himself.</p>

  <p>"Let's attack together. Let Edith take the red crystal to leave first," another creature spoke from not too far away. He was Vance, half human and half deer and a longtime member of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>"I agree." Shera nodded. "Even if we fight head on, we won't necessarily lose."</p>

  <p>If the members of the Black Ship teamed up, they would have enough strength to put up against a warrior at the Eternal Realm. After all, it was not long ago that the Black Ship trapped the Thunder Dimorphodon with only four of them.</p>

  <p>However, the strength of warriors at the Eternal Realm also varied in amount and energy. A warrior like Divine Farmer was obviously among the more powerful ones at the Eternal Realm. No one on the Black Ship was willing to face such a powerful existence unless it was an utmost necessity.</p>

  <p>Left with absolutely no choice, they decided to fight Divine Farmer head-on and as a team.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Invisible Ship moved through spatial transference again.</p>

  <p>As usual, Divine Farmer appeared behind it like a taunting shadow. Once he slashed down with the ruler, the brass man was already out of the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>A light emerged from the brass man's body, and just like that, the aura of an Other Shore Token surged out from him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a huge brass pillar appeared in his right hand as he charged towards the sky!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>With one attempt, the strike of Divine Farmer's ruler hit the brass pillar precisely. The brass pillar cracked right at the middle, and as if it was made out of soft mud, the crack trickled down all the way to the bottom of the pillar.</p>

  <p>The Combat Dragon Pillar, which was the brass man's prized weapon, was destroyed in an instant.</p>
