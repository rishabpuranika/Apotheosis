<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The little monsters' advancing speed had already reached an unimaginable level. They couldn't be seen with the naked eye.</p>

  <p>If the warriors didn't use their spiritual sense, locating the little monsters was completely impossible.</p>

  <p>Clark couldn't locate the monsters, nor could Murphy or any other Holy Being in fact, let alone the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>And nor could Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Nicholas had used other methods to perceive the little monsters' movements first, thus allowing him to catch one of them rather easily.</p>

  <p>How had Samuel managed to know their movements, though?</p>

  <p>Nicholas couldn't help but think this over, feeling surprised and confused at the same time.</p>

  <p>He knew that he didn't have the time to ponder over such a question right now. The little monsters were too difficult to deal with!</p>

  <p>"Aaaaargh!"</p>

  <p>One of the little monsters was struggling violently within the huge black palm created by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter how hard he fought back. Seeing as he had been captured by Nicholas, there was little chance of him escaping.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>In a split second, Nicholas had tightened his grip noticeably.</p>

  <p>Less than a moment later, the huge black palm reacted, erupting with a powerful force and grabbing the little monster even tighter.</p>

  <p>Beneath such indescribable force, the little monster's body was already distorted to an unrecognizable state.</p>

  <p>He continued howling like crazy and agitating himself from left to right.</p>

  <p>He didn't appear hurt in the least!</p>

  <p>"This creature's life energy is incredibly tenacious. What on earth are they, anyway?" exclaimed a Holy Being, unable to withhold his surprise.</p>

  <p>Nicholas shook his head and said, "I don't know, either. But I agree, they really are very special..."</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Let go of me right now, or you'll regret it!" The little monster suddenly threatened, screaming at the top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>As Nicholas heard the monster yell, he smiled faintly. "You can't even protect yourself properly. How will you ever make me regret anything?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking though, an odd sensation washed over him and he turned his head in the opposing direction.</p>

  <p>A second little monster was rushing over to him!</p>

  <p>This little monster was equally unimaginably rapid. Lightning speed. To make matters worse, he was carrying a ten feet long broadsword in his hand, which didn't match his two feet height whatsoever.</p>

  <p>When the others finally noticed the little monster, his broadsword was only inches away from Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Had it been anyone else, avoiding the weapon would have been impossible.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas looked like a prophet who had predicted everything in advance. He only gently lowered his head, and the broadsword flew narrowly above his skull, missing him by only a few inches.</p>

  <p>The little monster disappeared just as fast as he had come, leaving behind a gust of cold wind that chilled everyone to the bone.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas had successfully avoided this sudden attack, another little monster soon appeared at his side.</p>

  <p>This little monster had a large mouth, a gaping hole that was even larger than his own body. The second he came into view, he was already chomping at the huge black palm.</p>

  <p>The huge black palm created by Nicholas dissipated quickly. The little monster with the scary huge mouth quickly rescued the one that had been captured and once again disappeared from everyone's sight, leaving no trace behind.</p>

  <p>"We'll never capture them all because they move way too fast!"</p>

  <p>"We'd better leave the purple mist as soon as possible... Things are getting dangerous here."</p>

  <p>"If we stay, we're giving ourselves up at their mercy. That's just not something we can afford."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings, the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods were all on full alert. Their eyes were peeled and their senses keen.</p>

  <p>No matter how cautious they were, defending themselves from the speedy little monsters was an unbelievable challenge.</p>

  <p>If only they could use their spiritual sense in order to sense their enemies' positions and predict their movements in advance. At least then, they'd still have a fighting chance.</p>

  <p>This simply wasn't the case. No one, among everyone present, had the power to fight back except Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Nicholas kept his calm. He spoke loudly in order to encourage the others,</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please stay as close to me as you can. These little creatures might not be as powerful as you're all imagining."</p>

  <p>As the others listened to him speak, they reacted at once, moving quickly toward his back.</p>

  <p>Right now, they had no other choice but to rely on Nicholas's power. On their own, they were practically useless.</p>

  <p>Nicholas barely had the time to finish speaking!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A high-pitched roar rang out loudly in everyone's ears. At the same time, they felt a strong gust of wind nipping at their faces.</p>

  <p>As they squinted their eyes in an attempt to get a better look, they quickly noticed that one of the little monsters was standing just a few feet in front of them. In his hands, he grasped a human's head!</p>

  <p>"Oh! My dear brother!"</p>

  <p>Shocked, Jeremiah turned around on his heel, only to see that the Demi-holy Being of the Leng Clan had already become a headless corpse. The head in the little monster's hands was his.</p>

  <p>Fear and disbelief were written all over the dead man's face. How could this have happened?</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being, he hadn't yet demonstrated his true strength, but he had been killed unexpectedly. The sight was hard for Jeremiah, as well as for everyone else. How could they accept that he was dead?</p>

  <p>"Who said we aren't powerful? Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>The little monster grinned and then gently tossed his hands forward. The Demi-holy Being's head rolled out from his palms, teetering on his fingertips. The head was about to hit the ground.</p>

  <p>From that position, another little monster appeared and opened his large mouth, swallowing the Leng Clan's Demi-holy Being's head whole. He then patted his belly aggressively in front of them, letting out a series of strange chuckles.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! He-he!</p>

  <p>Delicious! What a treat!"</p>

  <p>Nobody had expected that a Demi-holy Being would die in such a cruel way, especially not now, at the hands of a tiny monster.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Jeremiah yelled.</p>

  <p>He couldn't stand it anymore.</p>

  <p>As he jumped upward suddenly, his hands suddenly clasped together, and a dazzling blue light bloomed from them.</p>

  <p>A brief moment later, a long spear with a chilling aura quietly appeared in his hands.</p>

  <p>Every one of these Holy Beings had the ability to destroy both the heaven and earth. In such a weird place, they simply couldn't release their spiritual sense, and thus, their movements were greatly restricted.</p>

  <p>Just as Jeremiah was about to unleash a full-blown attack regardless of the obvious dangers, a huge black palm suddenly appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>The black palm grabbed onto Jeremiah at once and pulled him down from the air. With a loud bang, he was smashed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the little monster carrying the broadsword flashed from where Jeremiah had been hovering seconds ago.</p>

  <p>Who had created the ominous black palm? Nicholas, of course!</p>

  <p>If he hadn't dragged Jeremiah back down to the ground, then he would've been killed as well.</p>

  <p>"Calm down!" warned Nicholas, in a loud voice, making sure he was heard.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah was too furious seeing his brother die before his own two eyes, but he had never thought that he'd nearly lose his own life because of it.</p>

  <p>"Speed is the most important thing for these little creatures. Once the purple mist dissipates, they won't be so scary and intimidating anymore," reminded Murphy.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah nodded and gently waved his hand in the air.</p>

  <p>A burst of chilling, cold wind spread around him, forming a milky white circle of light!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the circle of light was throbbing, pushing its way out from Jeremiah.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, everything within a thousand miles was frozen by the chilling power. It was overwhelmingly cold and icy.</p>

  <p>He'd also figured out their tactic. Since they were unable to capture the little monsters, they only needed to stay in their positions and defend themselves adequately.</p>

  <p>As soon as Jeremiah would use his icy enchanted barrier, the little monsters' speed would decrease greatly.</p>

  <p>Perhaps with the intention to provoke, the five little monsters hidden in the purple mist flew towards them at once, even after Jeremiah had frozen everything within a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>As they noticed what was happening, Nicholas's and Samuel's eyes lit up with caution.</p>

  <p>This time, Samuel seemed to remember something out of the blue. He cast an indifferent glance at Nicholas and chose not to attack instead.</p>

  <p>On his behalf, Nicholas quickly extended his hands and formed two huge black palms which slapped violently in all directions!</p>
