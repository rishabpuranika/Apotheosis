<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1544 The Falling Snow (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The golden hammer shadows in front of Luo Zheng belonged to a mysterious hammer technique with thousands of years of history behind it.</p>

  <p>As the moments passed by, more and more golden hammer shadows appeared out of nowhere, making it impossible for anyone to tell if they were real or fake. It was, without a doubt, not an easy feat to break them.</p>

  <p>Hopeless as it might seem, Luo Zheng had no intention of breaking through them. He was more inclined to employing the brute force to fight back.</p>

  <p>And that was the most efficient method rather than taking a sneaky way out.</p>

  <p>It was widely-known that Norton's strength was extraordinary. Everyone presumed that no warriors sharing the same level as him could match up to him just with brute force. Even for the city lord herself that Norton had served for years, she was certainly stronger than Norton, but her brute strength was not up to par with that of him. Therefore, to fight Norton in this way only meant giving in to a resounding defeat!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, would not be put at a disadvantage, since he had the power of dragon scales and the divine weapon body. Even a powerful warrior, who had a much higher cultivation level than him, would be in a vulnerable state, let alone those warriors who were also at the same level as him.</p>

  <p>These strapping attributes of Norton made Luo Zheng not to retreat a single step. Instead, he shifted towards Norton.</p>

  <p>"You have some nerve! I'll kill you in an instant!"</p>

  <p>Norton growled under his breath as he watched Luo Zheng rushing towards him instead of running away. Bracing himself, he then poured all his strength into his arms. Moments after, the Soul Sea in his body began to stir up monstrous waves as his immense power spread out, ready for a kill. He was like a god of strength, summoning all the golden hammer shadows to descend upon Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>In contrast, for a split second, Luo Zheng had also activated the power of up to ten thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>The supreme power within his body was like a chaotic tidal wave as it surged forth. Although the hammer shadows were like a myriad of blossoming flowers that dazzled his eyes, making it hard for him to figure out whether they were real or fake, Luo Zheng did not plan to resist the hammer blows. His main target was Norton.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Seemingly like in a fashion of throwing caution to the wind, Zheng's body movement suddenly gathered momentum as he formed a Barging Fist with one hand. It only looked like a random punch, but the power contained within it far exceeded anyone's imagination!</p>

  <p>From Norton's point of view, Luo Zheng was nothing but someone putting his life on the line in this kind of battle.</p>

  <p>Norton laughed heartily as his right hand made a grasping motion, making the golden hammer shadows that crowded the sky quickly reduced by half. He fully knew that Luo Zheng was extraordinary based on their previous encounter, where he hit him hard with his hammers. In his anticipation to block Zheng's attack, he positioned a large golden hammer on his chest. The Barging Fist that Luo Zheng swiftly set in motion looked starkly simple, but Norton was deathly afraid that he would play tricks on him. He didn't want to die together with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What if they both perished side by side? Then half of his and Zheng's Illusion Points would be left in this place. Chances were that they would be taken away by some other meddlesome warriors. And in the worst-case scenario, he would receive a terrible scolding from his young master!</p>

  <p>Norton might look reckless, but on the contrary, he was meticulous. He carefully withdrew one of the enormous golden hammers and transformed the other one immediately into an army of hammer shadows. Aiming them directly towards Luo Zheng, he entertained the notion that this hammer strike was going to smash Zheng's head into pieces!</p>

  <p>Anyone could say that Norton had made the most accurate judgment in a heartbeat.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how accurate and flawless his judgment was, it was still rendered useless under the suppression of Zheng's absolute strength!</p>

  <p>When Zheng's punch landed on Norton's defensive golden hammer, the latter immediately understood something.</p>

  <p>The force behind Zheng's punch was barely strong, and even Zheng's entire Mu Ning had been engulfed and concealed by Norton, but when his Barging Fist had come in contact with the golden hammer, Norton could only feel an overwhelming force emanating from it!</p>

  <p>And like a ripple-effect, the force of his fist hit the golden hammer, and the golden hammer subsequently hit Norton's chest.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A loud cracking sound soon reverberated!</p>

  <p>The circular golden hammer was punctured up in the middle by Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Zheng's Barging Fist did not stop there. It slid through the crack and hit Norton's chest.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng's fist was about to land on Norton's chest, another loud sound rang out!</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered when he heard this sound, but he secretly sighed in his heart, noting that Norton had a precious treasure to defend himself!</p>

  <p>A defensive treasure that could support the power of ten thousand dragon scales was at least a first-rank divine weapon. However, even if a precious treasure protected his chest, Norton would still be heavily injured, and that was inevitable. The precious treasure could only mitigate the injuries he would sustain. Unless it was a supreme divine weapon, it could not completely defend him against the attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was more worried about Norton possessing a golden pill. It was clear as day that all his previous undertakings would go down the drain if Norton happened to attempt to squish a golden pill and kill himself.</p>

  <p>Norton was thrown backward by the compelling brute force. He knew he was seriously injured as he could feel the immense pressure still lingering in his internal organs. It also shook his inner world, causing his Soul Sea to collapse!</p>

  <p>At this point, Norton wasn't thinking about protecting his own life, but he was in dire need of keeping his young master's Illusion Points!</p>
