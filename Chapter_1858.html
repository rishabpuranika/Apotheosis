<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1858 Wild King </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just as everyone had predicted, the members of the Collapsing Mountain race performed excellently this year.</p>

  <p>In the past, only one out of three people reached the level of "outstanding warrior". This year, aside from a handful of people, almost all of them were able to achieve the title.</p>

  <p>Some of them even reached the "mighty warrior" level.</p>

  <p>Also, there was one of them who had obtained the title of "super powerful warrior".</p>

  <p>Compared to the other Collapsing Mountain race members, this particular warrior was a lot taller and more muscular. The amount of strength source he had absorbed was far more than that of the average race members, which was why he was able to reach such title.</p>

  <p>When he punched the golden rock, it shook and slipped at a distance of five feet and three inches. This was impressive to most.</p>

  <p>Many years had passed since the last super powerful warrior appeared for the Collapsing Mountain race. When Chapman announced his title, all members immediately burst in applause and excitement.</p>

  <p>A warrior with his title was likely to become leader of the Collapsing Mountain race in the future. Although this test could be considered crude, it remained significant to every participating member.</p>

  <p>After all the Collapsing Mountain warriors completed their tests, it was time for the other races to begin.</p>

  <p>Chapman was unshaken. He always knew that the outsiders would outdo the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race always had a great advantage over strength. The members' bodies were far more superior to that of others.</p>

  <p>However, the body refining systems of non-Collapsing Mountain warriors were more advanced. Their bodies might not be as physically strong, but they had the ability to unlock their Path Platforms. Those who could unlock their Eight Path Platforms absorbed larger amounts of strength source.</p>

  <p>In the past, the amount of strength source was always limited. But because Collapsing Mountain race walked into that mountain before others, they garnered much more strength source than others.</p>

  <p>This year, the situation at Sacred Spring Mountain changed. The Collapsing Mountain warriors weren't the only ones who had obtained sufficient strength source. Warriors from the other races apparently harvested more than enough as well.</p>

  <p>Foreign warriors used their cultivation methods to take advantage of the same strength, making it easier for them to surpass Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>"Theodore!"</p>

  <p>Chapman called out the name of the first foreign warrior.</p>

  <p>Someone moved away from the crowd; it was a skinny old man. He was less than five feet tall, and resembled a dwarf as he stood in front of a group of Collapsing Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>Hunched over and stick thin, the old man slowly walked up to the rock and lightly nodded at Chapman.</p>

  <p>As he approached, he stretched out a bony hand, gently stroked the golden square rock and then tapped his thumb on it.</p>

  <p>It was as if what lay in front of him was not just a heavy rock, but an exquisite antique.</p>

  <p>"This precious thing— a Magic Golden Stone. How rare!" He smirked,</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it would cost a lot at the divine land. Sir, would you mind selling it to me?" Theodore teased.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap," Chapman responded. "Just finish your test and get the hell out of here!"</p>

  <p>Many precious rocks surrounded the Collapsing Mountain race. The giant silver rocks, for example, were known as Silver Astral Stones. This kind of stones could be considered a rare, precious item.</p>

  <p>In the past, after some warriors from the other races entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they made all the effort to steal the Silver Astral Stone from them. Although these rocks were extremely difficult to destroy, people used acid to dissolve the rocks and then carried them to the outside world. In these times, the Collapsing Mountain race suffered a great loss.</p>

  <p>These occurrences angered every Collapsing Mountain member. They killed thieves as a warning to the others, and warriors from other races condemned the actions as well. In the end, fewer and fewer people dared to covet the precious rocks.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Silver Astral Stones, the Collapsing Mountain race also had a small amount of Magic Golden Stones. The rock resting under Chapman's feet was the largest one of all.</p>

  <p>The Magic Golden Stone was much heavier than the Silver Astral Stone, so it was more rare, and even more precious.</p>

  <p>However, it was impossible for any ordinary warrior to take such a great treasure. Even top-quality space rings would be crushed at an attempt.</p>

  <p>Still, some warriors fantasized about buying it. Chapman refused quite a number of people, and everyone knew that he wouldn't agree with this old man, either.</p>

  <p>Theodore didn't mind Chapman's unfriendly tone at all. He only chuckled before taking a small step back.</p>

  <p>With a slight tremble of his body, his shirt turned to dust.</p>

  <p>A portion of his torso turned into a dark, blackish color. As the form intersected into a sleek figure, it formed a dragon-shaped pattern. This dragon had a strange shape; its body circled around the old man's back and spiraled up his chest, while the dragon head appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"Sinful Dragon Cultivation," Chapman raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>Although the Collapsing Mountain race never practiced foreign cultivation methods, it did not mean that they were completely ignorant.</p>

  <p>Liusu sat upright in her chair and noticed the little old man's cultivation method. She sneered and said, "I know where he is from."</p>

  <p>Kennan nodded in agreement. "I think you're right. He must be from that place. They've sent quite a few people down recently."</p>

  <p>"It's no use, though," Liusu said, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Kennan agreed and said, "As long as it's somewhere the Holy Emperor can see, it's doomed to destruction. This is useless as it is."</p>

  <p>After the dragon was completely formed, two red dots suddenly appeared on the old man's cheeks, right where the eyes of the dragon would be.</p>

  <p>In the same moment, an extremely ferocious aura burst out from the old man's body.</p>

  <p>Theodore used a knuckle of his hand to heavily strike at the golden rock in front of him.</p>

  <p>Everyone heard a snapping sound.</p>

  <p>It resembled a crisp sound of the old man's finger breaking.</p>

  <p>He made a motion, pushing the rock with just his knuckle.</p>

  <p>"This guy also had a good harvest at the Sacred Spring Mountain. He just formed the shape of a Sinful Dragon, check out that strength!" someone gasped.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet! It's said that people from that place are all unreasonable. It's better not to provoke them!" another said.</p>

  <p>"But can he really push the rock with only one finger?"</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was debating in whispers, a violent vibration came from the golden rock.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, it began to slide backwards continuously.</p>

  <p>Rumbling, it moved on the ground quickly but did not stop. It moved from three feet, to five, and kept on going.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With a loud bang, it stopped at the scale of eight feet and three inches.</p>

  <p>"A super powerful warrior!"</p>

  <p>"The first foreign warrior is a super powerful warrior!"</p>

  <p>"Why do so many foreign warriors possess insane strength?"</p>

  <p>The faces of the Collapsing Mountain warriors darkened; they weren't happy with what just happened.</p>

  <p>Every race would wish for their own warriors to be stronger than others.</p>

  <p>In fact, all the races in the six sacred places of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had been born with an instinctual resistance towards foreign warriors. They were displeased to see others taking advantage of the resources in their homeland.</p>

  <p>This was like a sect that gave away its most precious resources and inheritances to others after years of development.</p>

  <p>Such a thankless feat was no different from that of an idiot.</p>

  <p>However, this was the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. All of the rules here were set by the races' ancestors, and even Chapman didn't have the power to change them. He could only strive for the greatest advantages of his race.</p>

  <p>The old man stretched out his hand to rub his knuckle. With a proud expression on his face, he slightly nodded to the surrounding warriors and then stepped back into the crowd.</p>

  <p>Despite his resentment, Chapman still remained calm and composed on the surface.</p>

  <p>He announced the name of the next foreign warrior with the same cool, collected voice.</p>

  <p>One by one, the warriors from the other races completed their tests.</p>

  <p>Things were just as Chapman had expected. Warriors from other races displayed their strengths to the fullest potential— almost all exceeding the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Most of them could push the golden rock one foot away and obtained the title of "mighty warrior". Another few warriors pushed the rock over five feet away and obtained the title of "super powerful warrior".</p>

  <p>As it was known, the super powerful warrior was a very rare title. Even Chapman himself had only been a super powerful warrior in the past.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, this title wasn't too difficult to obtain among the foreign warriors. There were more than ten of them who were able to win the title, and one of them had even pushed the golden rock nine feet and three inches away.</p>

  <p>Another seven inches and that warrior would have obtained the title of a wild king!</p>

  <p>All warriors who were titled as a wild king enjoyed special privileges in the Collapsing Mountain race. The last person who had achieved this was Pascal, Liusu's elder brother.</p>
