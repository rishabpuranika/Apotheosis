<br/><br/>

  <p>At last, Luo Zheng had done everything he possibly could. But all that he could do now was to place his every hope in Kaydan.</p>

  <p>Zheng's most recent interception had caused the Formless Sky Pythons to sink into absolute chaos. Once the Formless Sky Pythons had been thrown into the mess, their only desire was to crawl out from beneath their fellow pythons. The harder they tried though, the greater the disarray became. A few of the Formless Sky Pythons' bodies were scattered across the ground, intertwined and entangled together.</p>

  <p>Despite the turmoil and disorder, many of the Formless Sky Pythons continued to charge out in an attempt to attack the warriors.</p>

  <p>Kaydan looked out across the black sphere and noticed that, thanks to his Heavenly Jade Seal, a green, luminous pattern had begun to spread throughout.</p>

  <p>As the green light continued to disperse itself and flow along the pattern, Kaydan suddenly announced, "It has been done!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors stared vigilantly at the Formless Sky Pythons. Upon noticing that Luo Zheng was lying on the ground, they instantly knew that their only choice was to risk their lives in the next coming round.</p>

  <p>And that was when Kaydan's voice rang out. The warriors were immersed and hearing it, they felt that it was the most beautiful heavenly music in the world!</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up and enter!"</p>

  <p>Warriors could be heard shouting at one another. Nearly all of them rushed hastily in hopes to be the first to reach and enter the black sphere.</p>

  <p>Under Kennan's careful protection, Han Liusu and the others carried Zheng's body and equally escaped into the black ball.</p>

  <p>At the same time as the warriors moved forward, the Formless Sky Pythons also decided to dash toward the black sphere. Luckily though, these pythons had no chance in entering for as soon as all the warriors had entered, the green pattern on the surface of the black ball instantly vanished, leaving no trace behind!</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Pythons weren't very intelligent. Instinctively, several of them began to launch their different attacks on the black sphere.</p>

  <p>Of course, it didn't matter how much the Formless Sky Pythons crashed into the sphere, or wrapped it up with their massive bodies in an attempt to crush it. The black ball did not budge an inch; it remained suspended mid-air, completely motionless. At its own speed and rhythm, the black sphere began to rotate on its own orbit, totally unaffected by the external force driven by the Formless Sky Pythons.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lay quietly on Liusu's back. He had lost all sense of perception of the outside world, including his sense of touch and sense of smell. Luo Zheng was quite uncomfortable, which was expected from this kind of full-body exhaustion. The key point of such an experience was that after the life vitality of a warrior who cultivated the life vitality had been exhausted, one could gradually recover his or her strength by using life vitality crystals. But to recover one's strength would take a period of time and a body refiner's thirst for strength was much greater than a warrior who cultivated the life vitality.</p>

  <p>Just at the right moment though, cyan dragon scales slowly lit up in the depths of Zheng's mind. It was the cyan dragon, quietly transmitting his strength to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a bold voice also sounded out, also in his mind. "Ha, ha, I forgot to remind you. Unless it's a life or death type of situation, body refiners should try their best not to squeeze out all of their strength!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng recognized this immediately as the red dragon's voice.</p>

  <p>And this was the truth. In fact, it was even considered a warrior's rule. In the face of all sorts of difficulties, there were still some occasions when life vitality and strength were insufficient. If one retained at least a small amount of strength, then this was doing the same as reserving an opportunity.</p>

  <p>But it was already too late. Zheng's desperate gamble had brought about serious consequences.</p>

  <p>Thankfully though, as the power of the dragon scales began to fill Luo Zheng, his body quickly began to regain a certain composure and the feeling of exhaustion gradually disappeared. This was an improvement, to say the least.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this didn't last long! As soon as all the energy had been channeled into Zheng's body, it was almost immediately sucked out of him by Eight Path Platforms! And soon after, Luo Zheng felt that the power contained within Eight Path Platforms had been sucked out by the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>Sensing this, Luo Zheng felt an overwhelming need to weep, but failed to shed a single tear.</p>

  <p>'Just how much power would be needed to fill the Nine Divine Stars?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng questioned himself solemnly.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon might have been silent now, but he continued to instill power into Zheng's body. Despite doing so though, the transmitted power felt more like a heavy stone sinking to the bottom of the ocean. It wasn't improving Zheng's situation whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Luo Zheng, his Nine Divine Stars were recovering at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>After all, these Nine Divine Stars existed within Zheng's chaotic sea. In addition to absorbing the energy from Zheng's Eight Path Platforms, they were also capable of continuously absorbing the surrounding chaotic energy. Naturally, they would replenish their own energy much faster than they would absorb Zheng's.</p>

  <p>On one side he had the power of dragon scales and on the other, Luo Zheng had a replenishment of chaotic energy. With these two sources of power, the Nine Divine Stars, which were originally extremely faint, began to emit a glowing rainbow colored light.</p>

  <p>It was then that the Nine Divine Stars stopped acting so crazily. They suddenly stopped absorbing the energy from Zheng's Eight Path Platforms, and the Eight Path Platforms stopped absorbing the energy from Zheng's fleshly body.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Luo Zheng began to take closer notice of the cyan dragon in his mind. The scales on his body were much dimmer than usual and without their shimmering light. In all honesty, they looked much like the ones that still needed to be lit up.</p>
