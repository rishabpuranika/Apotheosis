<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2958 Preparation Before Leaving </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The air in a palace on the Floating Island was permeated with the mellow smell of food.</p>

  <p>The True Gods didn't really need food to allay their hunger, but a variety of delicious food was always welcomed in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The food materials in the Floating Islands were sourced from many places in the divine land and were extremely rare. Ordinary disciples from the Floating Islands couldn't afford them, let alone the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you have made great progress in your cooking skills," Luo Zheng, who was seated at the table, complimented while tasting one of the dishes.</p>

  <p>The corners of Yan's mouth raised slightly, revealing a faint sense of pride, but she still said modestly, "You'd better thank Xi Youqin! It's her who has taught me how to cook these!"</p>

  <p>Yan had been separated from Luo Zheng at a young age. She just spent a little time with Mike and did not have a chance to see her mother before. Now that they were reunited, she naturally cherished these moments.</p>

  <p>She had started cooking recently and was loving it.</p>

  <p>Although there were many talented chefs in the Floating Island, Xi Youqin had personally taught Yan how to cook.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you are being modest. You are so talented. You know everything even without any guidance," said Mike.</p>

  <p>Yan sat on the other side of the large table, her chin resting in her hands.</p>

  <p>She looked at Lorena with a gleam in her intelligent eyes and said to her,</p>

  <p>"Mother, do you have something to say to me?"</p>

  <p>Lorena, who had been smiling the whole time, stiffened slightly when Yan suddenly asked her this question.</p>

  <p>"Mother, I know there is something on your mind," Yan said as she suddenly shot a cold glare at Luo Zheng. "And brother too, but he doesn't want to talk to me about it directly!"</p>

  <p>"It..." Luo Zheng looked embarrassed.</p>

  <p>It was true that he kept certain things from Yan. He didn't want his sister to be burdened with anything, but sometimes fate was out of one's control.</p>

  <p>"Let me guess." Yan blinked and asked, "The woman called Emily asked me if I would like to go to the Li Shan mountain while testing my blood. I don't know where that place is, but I'm sure it's not in the divine land. And perhaps you can't refuse her, am I right?"</p>

  <p>Yan had no idea of Chiyou's existence so she refused Emily's offer. That was the reason why she had come to this conclusion now.</p>

  <p>Looking at Mike's and Lorena's expressions, Yan lowered her head and spoke grimly, "If Father and Mother ask me to go to the Li Shan mountain, I won't refuse. It's just that I like to be here with you..."</p>

  <p>"It's not because of Emily! If it were only Emily who wanted you to go there, I would never agree to it, even if Father and Mother agreed," Luo Zheng said suddenly.</p>

  <p>A trace of suspicion flashed across Yan's eyes as she asked, "Then what is the real reason?"</p>

  <p>Lorena sighed and said, "It's because of your grandfather."</p>

  <p>"Grandfather? And who is my grandfather?" Yan asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>Lorena proceeded to tell her all about the origins of the Nine Li race and the Bear race, so that Yan could get an overview.</p>

  <p>After hearing out Lorena, Yan stared at Luo Zheng for a moment. "In other words, even if I don't go to the Li Shan mountain, you will still leave the divine land, right?" she asked glumly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Luo Zheng very much wanted to stay in the divine land. He would love to lead a happy life there in the company of Yudie and the rest.</p>

  <p>However, No. 9527 would never agree.</p>

  <p>Yan gently pursed her lips and finally nodded. "In that case, I promise to go to the Li Shan mountain..."</p>

  <p>All the experiences Yan had gone through had made her a mature woman.</p>

  <p>She was aware of the difficulties faced by her mother, so she wouldn't put her mother in a dilemma by being uncooperative.</p>

  <p>Even though she agreed to go, Lorena and Mike still felt depressed. Given a choice, they didn't want to force their daughter to leave them.</p>

  <p>Apart from convincing Yan to go, Luo Zheng had another problem on his hands.</p>

  <p>It might take him over a hundred years to get to the Source World, and he had no idea when he would be able to return.</p>

  <p>Yudie, Xi Youqin and the others had already become True Gods, and their lifespan was infinite, so they could wait for him for however long it took. In the past few years, he had been bustling about all the time and was able to spend very little time with them.</p>

  <p>So comforting them also posed a challenge for him.</p>

  <p>"I am not okay with you leaving, Luo Zheng! I'm not interested in the Source World at all. The divine land is so huge. There's no need for you to pay attention to a strange, remote place!" Xi Youqin was the first to stand up and object.</p>

  <p>Xun, Aura and the others were relatively calm, but they were also surprised at Luo Zheng's decision.</p>

  <p>The great trouble in the divine land had been taken care of in the end.</p>

  <p>However, now Luo Zheng intended to leave the divine land. This left them baffled.</p>

  <p>Yudie thought for a long time before speaking up suddenly, "If you really want to leave the divine land, you can take us with you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze froze as he asked, "You want to enter my inner world?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Yudie nodded eagerly. "Before we weren't strong enough, so we could only stay under the protection of the Immortal Mansion, but now all of us are True Gods so we can hide in your inner world."</p>

  <p>Yudie's proposal was feasible. Luo Zheng could create an entire continent for them and help them create a new environment. He could even replicate the entire Central Region!</p>

  <p>"But if I die, my inner world will also shatter. Then, how will you protect yourselves?" Luo Zheng asked with a look of concern.</p>

  <p>However, Yudie smiled tenderly. "If you die, I would not be willing to live any longer."</p>

  <p>Her answer touched Luo Zheng deeply.</p>

  <p>Even Xun, Aura, Nelly and the rest felt the same way.</p>

  <p>Liusu, who was sitting not far away, chuckled and said, "Besides, we want to see what the Source World is like!"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin and the others, who were born in the universe, had no interest in the Source World, but Nelly and Liusu had lived on the top of the divine land since birth. Their vision was much wider than the others. The Other Shore Realm was a source of mystery and awe for them. They had a great curiosity about the Source World.</p>

  <p>"But..." Luo Zheng still believed that the divine land was much safer for them. At least, ordinary Other Shore Realm warriors could not break through it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, as the divine land was at the edge of chaos, it was difficult to discover it.</p>

  <p>At this point, Xun stretched out her cold hand and covered Luo Zheng's forehead. She spoke casually, "There's no need to hesitate. This decision is not up to you; it is ours alone."</p>

  <p>"Okay!" Luo Zheng finally made the decision.</p>

  <p>Half a month later, he returned to the whirlpool and began collecting the divine crystals.</p>

  <p>According to Ramzi's estimation, after the speed of the divine land increased, the speed of the consumption of the divine crystals would be very slow.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't very clear about the value of these divine crystals, but they could be used in the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng only took away half of the divine crystals for any emergency, and left the Sun-resisting Umbrella to Mike.</p>

  <p>Even though Harper had died, the Reincarnation Soul Weapon could still locate his Memory Flame. If he could recover his cultivation base after he was revived, he would regain control of the direction of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>A month later, Timotheus, Emily and the others stood in front of the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>
