  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked to hear of such a method for cultivating an avatar.</p>

  <p>It was not fair to the avatar, who was not really the warrior, just a substitute.</p>

  <p>The avatar had its own consciousness and its own life.</p>

  <p>But it seemed that during those days, the powerful masters did not let too many worries or scruples get in the way of their activities.</p>

  <p>In some of the larger forces, the warriors whose strength ranked second to fifth, were all puppet avatars of their leaders.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, it was extremely rare to see creatures that cultivated the Inner-world Generating Avatar.</p>

  <p>On one hand, it was easy to get rid of the Rebirth Land. On the other hand, the level of strength pursued by the living beings in the Source World was getting higher and higher.</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore had first opened, creatures from the warriors' inner worlds would enter the Other Shore and fuse with the Other Shore Tokens in Stage Three or Stage Four. Then the creators would erase the memories of those creatures and transform them into their avatars.</p>

  <p>For warriors as strong as Athemar, they needed to let the creatures from their inner worlds enter Stage Twenty, or a higher stage.</p>

  <p>It took time to train an avatar. The longer the training, the greater the chance that the creatures would discover the truth of the Source World, and then they would try to get rid of the control of the Rebirth Land. No creature wanted to be an avatar.</p>

  <p>When a creature whose memories had been erased was transformed into an avatar, it lost its soul. It could no longer enter the Other Shore, and its cultivation base could not increase.</p>

  <p>Thus, while Athemar was easily able to cultivate a few avatars in the third or fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm, these avatars were too weak and useless for him.</p>

  <p>"Then..." Zheng said slowly, looking at the Evil God standing nearby.</p>

  <p>"He was created by you. If you have the chance, you can turn him into your avatar in the future," Athemar said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you must ensure you are stronger than him," Dorothy cautioned.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise, he will defeat you sooner or later. He might even be able to transform you into an avatar! It sounds impossible, but it is recorded that such a thing has happened before."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was too sinister. If there was a chance, Zheng must try his best to punish and control him.</p>

  <p>Inner-world Generating Avatar was indeed a good choice in this case.</p>

  <p>However, as Dorothy had warned, it was crucial to be at the proper level of strength. If Zheng tried to take on the Evil God without being strong enough, it was entirely possible that he would be the one to end up getting killed, or getting transformed into an avatar.</p>

  <p>As Zheng, Dorothy, and Athemar spoke, more and more ships flew down from the sky, landing beside the pillars.</p>

  <p>Many small races were arriving at the Icy Snow Province. Occasionally, one or two larger ships of the super forces would show up.</p>

  <p>Everyone present was calm and composed. Some of them sat cross-legged and closed their eyes to cultivate, while some of them entered the Other Shore to make deals and deal with things there.</p>

  <p>Each time the Chaotic Source World opened, a silence would settle over the noisy, busy Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>After all, the best Souls of Light from Stage Thirteen were gathered at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>A day passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng, standing with Feng Ge and the others, felt a faint vibration in the ground.</p>

  <p>The tremor also caught the attention of his companions.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Feng Ge, and the others looked instinctively to their right. The vibration was coming from the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>There were tens of thousands of people present, and every single one wore a look of eager anticipation. Everyone was praying that they would win the competition and become Chaotic Source Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The members of the large races were expectant and ready to get started, their eyes lit with fighting intent.</p>

  <p>The process of reaching the Chaotic Source Realm was by no means a simple matter of fusing with the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>It was a vicious battlefield. Members of various races faced off against each other, all prepared to do whatever took to claim victory. According to the rules set by the Pear Hill and the large races, there must be no retribution— no matter who killed a warrior in the Chaotic Source World, the warrior's race would not be allowed to punish the killer.</p>

  <p>As the vibration reverberated across the ground, the giant black egg began spinning slowly.</p>

  <p>However, upon closer observation, they saw that it was not really the egg itself that was spinning. Rather, it was the thick black smog inside the enchanted barrier that spun slowly.</p>

  <p>One by one, the runes lined in front of the gate of the Chaotic Source World began lighting up. The stone door in front of the participants gradually began to open.</p>

  <p>Two women stood beside the stone door. They were members of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>One of them shouted, "The Chaotic Source World has opened. The people from the Pear Hill will enter first!"</p>

  <p>Those who entered the Chaotic Source World first had a great advantage.</p>

  <p>They could lie in wait as the others arrived, and ambush them. Or they could quickly rush into the depths of the Chaotic Source World without worrying about encountering other warriors.</p>

  <p>Since the Pear Hill had contributed the Chaotic Source World, the members of the Pear Hill naturally had a privilege that no one from other races could obtain.</p>

  <p>Each time the Chaotic Source World opened, the members of Pear Hill were always the first to enter.</p>

  <p>Yan stood up. Her gaze fell on Zheng. She gestured towards him and slightly moved her lips, saying through her life vitality, "I'll be waiting for you inside."</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>He had no desire to be a burden on Yan. If she had a superior ability to protect herself, then he would much prefer that she go as deep into the Chaotic Source World as she could.</p>

  <p>"There's no need. You'd better absorb the Chaotic Source Spirit first," Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>Yan looked unhappy. She resolved not to listen to Zheng. She would wait for him once she was inside, regardless of what he said now.</p>

  <p>The members of the Pear Hill lined up and passed through the stone door one after another.</p>

  <p>As they passed, they pressed their tickets to the Chaotic Source World against the runes by the side of the stone door. They were allowed to enter only after the tickets were shattered.</p>

  <p>As soon as all the Pear Hill members had entered, a woman standing by the stone door stepped forward. She lifted a handful of petals to her lips and lightly blew, and the petals scattered outwards in all directions, like a colorful rain. They seemed to multiply as they drifted on the wind, until there were tens of thousands of petals.</p>

  <p>One of the petals floated directly towards Zheng. It came to a stop in front of him and hovered motionless in the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out and grasped the petal gently between two fingers. He looked closely at the petal and saw a number written on the delicate surface.</p>

  <p>"13, 352..." Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>"Mine says 7, 000," said Feng Ge, showing her petal to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I have 18, 060," said Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Zheng lightly placed the petal on his palm. "So this is the sequence in which we'll enter the Chaotic Source World? Is it always like this? Warriors enter in an entirely random order?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had assumed that the members of the same race could enter the Chaotic Source World together. As allies, they could watch out for each other and cooperate in order to get further. But this random sequence made that impossible now.</p>

  <p>"In the past, members of the same race were allowed to enter together, but they just ended up fighting in groups almost as soon as they entered the Chaotic Source World. So the rule was changed," Feng Ge explained.</p>

  <p>Many large races and super forces had long histories with each other, which often involved some degree of enmity and animosity. When groups of warriors entered the Chaotic Source World and began fighting each other, this caused enormous losses to many races. To minimize the needless deaths, the Pear Hill had decided that participants would enter the Chaotic Source World individually, and that the order of entrance would be determined randomly.</p>

  <p>Sally, Hutton, and the others held their own petals in their hands. They also looked surprised at this unexpected twist. This rule had only been in place for a few decades, and they had not yet heard of it.</p>

  <p>They had all been operating under the assumption that they would enter together, and they were at a loss at this development.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I will wait for you at the entrance," Zheng said to Sally with a smile.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Sally curled her lips at Zheng, shaking her head. She morosely showed him her petal. "You'll be waiting a long time. Look, I got number 39, 000!"</p>
