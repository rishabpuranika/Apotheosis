<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 827 The Heavenly Kill </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was very clear about his goal.</p>

  <p>His first purpose of coming to the Tower of Sin was to cultivate himself.</p>

  <p>His second objective was to obtain inheritance of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The ogre and the Demon Night were both top races of the Sea God Continent, while humans seemed to be incomparably weak here. As soon as Luo Luo Zheng arrived on the Sea God Continent, he had invited the enmity of the ogres. But he wasn't stupid to feud with the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had used the blade of his sword to hit Teresa on the butt, the force of the blow was still quite heavy. Teresa staggered and pounced forward, looking quite embarrassed.</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night were always elegant and proud. They would never allow themselves to be humiliated in front of everyone like this. The moment Teresa reached the ground, she pushed against it, nimble as a reptile, and turned over, wanting to fight back.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was fast.</p>

  <p>The sword had already reached Teresa's snow-white neck, the tip of the sword pulsing with energy. If Luo Luo Zheng were to raise his hand and move the sharp sacred weapon a bit, it could probably cut Teresa's head off.</p>

  <p>Teresa was angry and embarrassed, but she wasn't stupid. She had read the rules of the Tower of Sin countless times before she came here and understood them quite well.</p>

  <p>She was powerful, noble, and respected in the sacred place. No one would dare take her life there. But on the arena, no one could protect her, even if the Demon Night won many seats in the Tower of Sin. The rules were set by a lot of races, and it was impossible for anyone to change them just for a divine-level talent like her.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng managed to kill her, the Demon Night would avenge her. But they couldn't bring her back to life anyway.</p>

  <p>"Admit defeat and I won't kill you," Luo Luo Zheng said calmly. It wasn't that he didn't know how to show mercy to a woman. But right now, the slightest carelessness on his part could lead to his death. Still, he was kind enough to be willing to let her off.</p>

  <p>"I... I admit you've defeated me," Teresa said, grasping the situation despite her obvious resentment.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the Lucky Light of Teresa's token shot into Luo Zheng's token.</p>

  <p>The Lucky Light was a reward to the victor. And the amount of Lucky Light that the victor could get depended on the opponent's Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>Teresa was a war general of the Demon Night, one who was skillful in battle. The only people who had dared challenge her were war generals; some even those of a higher level. So the amount of Lucky Light that Luo Luo Zheng got from Teresa was ten times more than before.</p>

  <p>Thus it was good to have high cultivation bases. When Luo Luo Zheng had entered the first floor of the Tower of Sin, those who had dared challenge him were all war fighters who had small amounts of Lucky Light and only earned few points.</p>

  <p>Teresa glared viciously at Luo Luo Zheng and walked out of the arena.</p>

  <p>Phoebe heaved a sigh of relief. But what Luo Luo Zheng had done on the arena had surprised her a lot.</p>

  <p>Phoebe had seen Luo Luo Zheng escape in a flash before, from the three ogre war lords. It was still considered unimaginable for him to do that while he was still a war fighter. However, it was difficult for Phoebe to estimate Luo Zheng's actual strength, mostly because it was rather obvious that she didn't take Luo Luo Zheng to be an ordinary war fighter. But she had also not expected Luo Luo Zheng to be unbeatable to this extent.</p>

  <p>There was another wave of whispers in the auditorium.</p>

  <p>"No wonder Boris warned us not to be reckless and fight with him. This guy is a human war fighter, but he can even defeat a Demon Night war general!"</p>

  <p>"Is she just a Demon Night war general? That woman from the Demon Night is a divine-level talent from the Demon Night's sacred place. You can't treat her as a normal war general! But she has still been defeated by the human war fighter!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't human beings supposed to be more difficult to deal with only after they become unbeatable, war lords or war sages? Since when has their grand sacred place cultivated such a great genius?"</p>

  <p>"I think he said that he isn't from the grand sacred place."</p>

  <p>"If this guy keeps attacking and triumphing over others floor by floor in the Tower of Sin, I'm afraid that the human beings will win one more seat!"</p>

  <p>All sorts of discussions surrounded Luo Luo Zheng as the creatures of all races stared at him and whispered among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Is there anyone else who wants to challenge me?" Luo Luo Zheng asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>There was an eerie silence that nobody wanted to break.</p>

  <p>"Isn't Tito of the Orcs very famous on the second floor? Where's he? How is it that I don't see him?"</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me? Tito is just a tenth-level war fighter. Although he has successfully knocked down three war generals, he isn't a match even for Teresa, much less for this guy!"</p>

  <p>"No one dares go up into the arena if he knows his own limitations. Even though that guy is willing to let off the Demon Night, he might not spare the lives of other races!"</p>

  <p>Teresa had shown her powerful strength and instilled an awe and fear in everyone around her. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had defeated her, this kind of deterrence had actually been strengthened. Perhaps no other living being dared challenge Luo Luo Zheng at this moment, given that he had won against Teresa.</p>

  <p>Moreover, word of Luo Zheng's achievements on the first floor had reached the second floor, and absolutely no one dared battle him right now.</p>

  <p>If no one challenged Luo Luo Zheng, it meant that he didn't have to battle with anyone from now on and could get the default victory. He would be able to get free promotion if he didn't need to combat for three consecutive days.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was quite satisfied with this result.</p>

  <p>As for Teresa of the Demon Night, she was obviously not content with it at all.</p>

  <p>Teresa was angry and indignant as she walked out of the arena. The Demon Night war lord hastily followed her.</p>

  <p>Teresa had never encountered such a humiliating defeat before.</p>

  <p>She was the one of the best, even if she lived amidst numerous geniuses in the sacred place of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the opponent that she had lost to was not only a human, but a human war fighter. If her warrior spirit hadn't been strong enough, she would have suffered a devastating blow.</p>

  <p>"I... I must kill him!" Teresa yelled angrily.</p>

  <p>"This brat is outstandingly powerful. You can't match him at the moment," the Demon Night war lord said calmly.</p>

  <p>"I don't care! If I can't kill him in the normal way, I'll use the Heavenly Kill to deal with him!" Teresa said, cold determination in her voice.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night war lord was astonished at Teresa's words. He immediately rushed to pacify her. "Teresa, do not do such a silly thing. The Heavenly Kill is a very special and magical cultivation method. It is prohibited and must not be employed unless it is absolutely necessary. Have you forgotten our elders' advice?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely necessary? It is necessary right now, isn't it?" Teresa said stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to be in such a hurry. This guy has come to the Tower of Sin just to train. You will meet him sooner or later. You can challenge him when you become strong and powerful enough. It looks like there's a woman of the Demon Night who's by his side. I don't know which faction she belongs to, but I'll look for her and ask her about the situation first," the Demon Night war lord tried comforting her.</p>

  <p>"When I become strong enough?" Teresa was surprised, but after pondering over it for a short while, she looked even more depressed. "Won't that guy also become stronger and more powerful by then?"</p>

  <p>'He is just a war fighter now, but he was able to defeat me. If he becomes a war general, can I match up to him and beat him?' Teresa thought.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night war lord had also realized this, but that was the only way he could use to comfort her. But it looked like his advice was useless. In the end, the Demon Night war lord could only sigh. But luckily, Luo Luo Zheng did not seem to have any intention of killing Teresa.</p>

  <p>Teresa was just too arrogant. It was probably good for her to taste defeat during the battle in the Tower of Sin. This experience could be considered exercise for her warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>Since no one had challenged Luo Luo Zheng, he left the arena, and Phoebe followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>Just like Teresa, Luo Luo Zheng also wanted to get to the top floor of the Tower of Sin as soon as possible. He had no interest in fighting with those war fighters, but according to the rules of the Tower of Sin, he had no choice.</p>

  <p>This time, when Luo Luo Zheng arrived at the living quarters on the second floor, he saw quite a few women by the side.</p>

  <p>There were women of all races, including ogres, orcs, human beings and other races. There were even women from the Demon Night!</p>

  <p>These women were all dressed sexily, their curvaceous figures tempting the senses in the most primitive of ways.</p>

  <p>"These women..." Luo Luo Zheng looked at them, confused.</p>

  <p>"Prostitutes," Phoebe replied bluntly. "Warriors are stressed in the Tower of Sin, and all of them try to relieve the pressure by having fun with these prostitutes. From the first floor to the tenth floor, prostitutes are very common on each floor."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng curled his lips. In addition to those human and Demon Night prostitutes, there were even prostitutes from the orc and the ogre. Naturally, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't accept their ugly appearances.</p>

  <p>He couldn't bear to stay here any longer. Just as he was about to leave, a human woman walked out from the other side and blocked his path. She smiled up at him. "Hey! Someone wants to have a good talk with you."</p>

  <p>The woman was a perfect beauty. Luo Luo Zheng faintly smiled at her and asked, "How many life vitality crystals can you get for one night?"</p>

  <p>The woman became furious at Luo Zheng's words, her face showing the extent of her anger.</p>
