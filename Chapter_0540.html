<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 540 Envy (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>His words brought back the memories to all the other sect heads. They all burst into a fit of laughter because of Evan's funny story.</p>

  <p>In truth, Evan was a talented refiner. He would've entered the Cloud Hall if he hadn't fallen asleep on the Cloud Road. It was also highly possible for him to have outperformed all the other disciples in the contest.</p>

  <p>However, his careless nature prevented him from being the first place.</p>

  <p>Nobody expected for him to fall asleep along the way! They could still recall how enraged Kenneth was by Evan's doing. He looked so terrifying at that time that they all feared he would kill Evan as punishment.</p>

  <p>Would history repeat itself?</p>

  <p>"Don't worry Kenneth. You have brought your most excellent disciples, and they're all smart. Even your third most excellent disciple captured the essence of the consummate sword intent. This disciple might have found something and meditated for that reason. Do you agree, Kenneth?"</p>

  <p>Eddy said in a seemingly joking tone. He had somehow harbored a kind of animosity towards Tianming. It wasn't because he hated him, he just felt envious of Cloud Sect's good fortune. He really didn't expect that a disciple from Cloud Sect had understood the consummate sword intent.</p>

  <p>"What did you say, Eddy? Did you say that a Cloud Sect disciple has understood the consummate sword intent?" Fernandez turned towards Eddy and asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Master Fei. The disciple is just the third most excellent disciple in the Cloud Sect. I wonder how smart the first and the second most excellent disciples of the Cloud Sect are if the third best one is at such a high level?" Eddy said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Fernandez nodded his head, showing his interest. "That's interesting. The consummate sword intent is of great importance. Even the Cloud Hall would be extremely interested in the disciple who has understood it. I'm really surprised that the disciple is just ranked third in the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Kenneth, would the first and the second most excellent disciples defeat the one who has understood the consummate sword intent?" he continued.</p>

  <p>Those were the words Eddy wanted to hear from Fernandez. Since he and Kenneth were of equal status, Kenneth could ignore him and refuse to answer his questions. However, he couldn't do that to an elder from the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>A smile formed on Kenneth's face. "Master Fei, all disciples of the Cloud Sect have witnessed the All Peaks Competition. We have hundreds of thousands of disciples in the Cloud Sect and we treat them all equally.</p>

  <p>It's impossible to fabricate the competition results. Tianming is the disciple who has understood the consummate sword intent and is ranked at the third place in the competition. The disciple who is in the trance at the stone gate is Luo Zheng, the first among all excellent disciples of the Cloud Sect ranked according to the competition results," he responded politely.</p>

  <p>"He? The first among all excellent disciples of the Cloud Sect? But he is at the grade three of nature level!" Fernandez exclaimed dubiously. He found it hard to believe that a disciple who was just at the initial stage of refining could defeat Tianming, who had mastered the consummate sword intent.</p>

  <p>Fernandez's capabilities exceeded far beyond those of the sect heads of the Internal Elixir Realm in front of him. But even with his tremendous wisdom, he couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng had defeated Tianming.</p>

  <p>Kenneth felt uneasy of Fernandez's doubts. He just smiled and said in an honest tone,"The consummate sword intent is of course, powerful, but it is not invincible. Besides, Tianming is not the only person to grasp the essence of the consummate sword intent. Luo Zheng has understood it, too. In addition, Luo Zheng got a precious opportunity after he understood it. It was an opportunity that led to a more valuable secret place than the Sword Washing Pool!"</p>

  <p>Eddy suddenly coughed a few times because of Kenneth's words. As a cultivator in the Internal Elixir Realm, his ability to control his body under extreme conditions was beyond ordinary people's imagination.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't stop coughing and couldn't put his mind at ease. He was so shocked by what Kenneth had said that he lost control of himself.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone were surprised by Kenneth's words as well. They all looked confused, as if they couldn't figure out what Kenneth meant when he said "The consummate sword intent is of course, powerful, but it is not invincible." Eddy felt extremely proud when he had finally cultivated a disciple who mastered the successful sword intent. He had never thought that Kenneth had trained his disciples to use the consummate sword intent, not to mention he had successfully trained two of them!</p>

  <p>All the other sect heads also wore faces of shock or envy. Even Fernandez was suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is at the grade three of nature level. How could he be bestowed with such a great opportunity? According to the records of some ancient books, the Sword Washing Pool is a semi-holy site. Kenneth, you said the opportunity Luo Zheng acquired had brought him to a place much better than the semi-holy site. Did he visit a sword holy site?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Kenneth nodded,"Luo Zheng didn't tell me where he went, but I have sensed a substantial amount of malicious Mu Ning in him. So I guess he must have gone to the Killing Sword Mountain, one of the three sword holy sites."</p>

  <p>Fernandez's face finally changed after Kenneth's explanation. The holy sites were sacred places all refiners dreamed of going. They were categorized into more sacred and less sacred kinds. The Killing Sword Mountain was one of the most famous sword holy sites, and the best one among all the sacred places. Fernandez never expected that such a young man, who had just achieved the grade three of nature level, had gone to that famous holy mountain. Envy gradually surged within him.</p>
