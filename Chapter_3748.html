  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization performed more than half a minute of calculations, the Civilization Artifact released a green beam of light.</p>

  <p>The green light then formed a light curtain, which outlined the hideous monster in the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>The monster had no head, only two round eyeballs. Its eyes blinked twice, which made it look frightening.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a thought popped inside Luo Zheng's mind. "Why can these monsters maintain their forms in the Abstruse Energy World?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>He remembered that those monsters from the Abstruse Energy World he met before turned into tentacles after they entered the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p id="top_25">"It should be because of the extreme temperature. If the Cold Prisons were destroyed, then those light dots would return to their original forms," the green figure explained.</p>

  <p>"But why are they sealed off here?" Phoenix asked.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were filled with curiosity as she observed them. She had passed by this place several times, and she felt awkward when she thought about how the monsters stared at her every time she was around.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," the green figure said and shook its head. "The Cold Prisons already existed when we built the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization here, but at that time, there weren't so many of them," it mumbled.</p>

  <p>Back then, there were only over a hundred Cold Prisons surrounding the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. Now, there were potholes everywhere, and there were tens of thousands of Cold Prisons.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the Element Spirit Civilization captured and locked them here for study," said Li Bianxue, who stood beside them.</p>

  <p>"That's possible," Luo Zheng agreed and nodded.</p>

  <p>When the Calculation Civilization had managed to see the original appearance of the monsters, they also tried to communicate with them.</p>

  <p>If the monsters were intelligent beings, then the Calculation Civilization could obtain information about the Abstruse Energy World from them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they tried every way they could, but they had failed every time.</p>

  <p>In the end, they finally gave up.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also planned to communicate with them but did not bother anymore when he heard about the Calculation Civilization's failed attempts.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he unexpectedly gained a wonderful skill after he followed Phoenix's advice to pass through the upper ice field and activated the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>True enough, he could decipher all the Sanskrit words and see through the light dots of the Abstruse Energy World through the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. His new ability was immensely useful to him and the Primeval Lord of Heaven. Still, the most important thing was the Calculation Civilization's goal was to create a real Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>If Yan could control the complete Energy Shaft, then that would easily solve all their problems!</p>

  <p>After the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization operated for a while, it stopped and became quiet. The calculation had consumed a large amount of energy.</p>

  <p>"The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization has been here for so many years. With the way the Element Spirit Civilization does things, I'm afraid they will try their best to destroy it. Why did they just choose to seal it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"They tried, but failed," the green figure said with a hint of pride.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization was not omnipotent.</p>

  <p>For instance, the human race's Creation Myth Temple had stood on Stage Seventeen for so long, but the Element Spirit race couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng was done asking some other questions, he continued to move towards the other end of the upper ice field under the Divine Fire Shield.</p>

  <p>When he passed by the many large and small Cold Prisons, he also quietly observed them.</p>

  <p>Some of the Cold Prisons were quite spacious and had many light dots inside them. Luo Zheng stopped in his tracks and asked the green figure to help him decipher them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was now activated, so he could still rely on it no matter how far he was away from it or even if he was in the upper stages.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>His cinnabar field released two rays of green light which directly entered his pupils.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he finally saw that the light dots in the Cold Prison in front of him were already in their original appearance. It turned out that sealed inside the Cold Prison was a bull-shaped monster.</p>

  <p>Next, he proceeded to advance further and observed more kinds of creatures.</p>

  <p>Phoenix and Li Bianxue were curious and also wanted to see these creatures, so the green figure reflected the scene in their eyes. After they looked at a few strange monsters, however, they were no longer interested.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he felt a little disappointed as he observed them.</p>

  <p>He wanted to find some traces of civilization from the monsters of the Abstruse Energy World, but after he had examined them for so long, it seemed that all the creatures in the Cold Prisons were very primitive.</p>

  <p>The three of them saw a Cold Prison that was thirty miles wide on the ice field when they passed through a particular area.</p>

  <p>This huge Cold Prison stood in front of them and blocked their way. "This Cold Prison is so huge!" Li Bianxue exclaimed as she stared ahead.</p>

  <p>The biggest Cold Prison they saw before was only over a hundred feet wide, and they could easily go around it. This time, the one in front of them was thirty miles wide, and it would take a lot of effort to go around it.</p>

  <p>"That's strange. This Cold Prison only appeared recently. I've never seen such a big one two years ago," Phoenix commented.</p>

  <p>The last time she had passed through the ice field was two years ago, and she did not see this big Cold Prison at that time.</p>

  <p>"Let's see what's in this huge Cold Prison first," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were numerous white dots scattered around the Cold Prison. Of course, the creature sealed inside it must be massive in size!</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>After the green light swept through the light dots, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization began to calculate again.</p>

  <p>The Cold Prisons Luo Zheng had previously seen were all quite small and did not contain many light dots. Thus, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had quickly deciphered them. It only took about half a minute to complete the whole process.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, this thirty-mile wide Cold Prison had so many light dots inside, so it was much more complicated to calculate.</p>

  <p>It was not until about an hour later that the green light entered Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>His jaw dropped as soon as he saw what was inside the Cold Prison. He couldn't help but take two steps back and almost dropped the Divine Fire Shield.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Phoenix was quick to react and immediately caught the Divine Fire Shield before it fell. At the same time, she asked, "What did you see?</p>

  <p>Why are you so excited?" "It's a giant..." he murmured.</p>

  <p>It was a fat bald giant.</p>

  <p>The giant wore handcuffs and shackles.</p>

  <p>His bald head was down and his eyes were closed, as if he was asleep.</p>

  <p>This was the first human-shaped creature that Luo Zheng had seen, so he was naturally a little excited.</p>

  <p>Just as he was looking at the giant, the giant suddenly opened his eyes!</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The light spots in the Cold Prison fluctuated like mad. They were like countless sparks that rose when a bonfire was destroyed.</p>

  <p>The giant struggled madly in Luo Zheng's sight. Then, the giant got up and grabbed at him who was outside the Cold Prison. This giant could move freely inside the big Cold Prison!</p>

  <p>"Hold the Divine Fire Shield tightly!" he warned.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he held the Divine Fire Shield and quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>In return, the giant's large hands stretched out from the Cold Prison and grabbed at their heads!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng had retreated about four thousand feet with the protection of the Divine Fire Shield. Thankfully, there was no Cold Prison behind them. If there was, then the consequences were unimaginable.</p>
