<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2949 Hiding The Divine Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Three months in the universe were equal to ten days in the divine land, where time moved much more slowly.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed to be content with everyday life in the universe, which worried No. 9527. If he decided to stay indefinitely, it would certainly fail the task that its master had given it. Eventually, it could no longer hide its anxiety, and decided to discuss the matter with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's not all bad here, you know," Zheng simply replied.</p>

  <p>He held up a cup of tea to his mouth. Wrapping a finger around its tiny handle, he sipped his drink carefully.</p>

  <p>The taste of spiritual tea back in the Upper World was miles ahead of the fresh tea he was now drinking. And yet, Zheng could not get enough of the slight bitterness that lingered on the tip of his tongue with every sip. It just seemed fitting as he looked around the Eastern Region, now flourishing at springtime.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 scowled at Zheng's calm demeanor, making no efforts to hide its disdain. As if to simultaneously remind and scold, it said, "In case you forgot, Zheng, the divine land is unsafe. Chiyou made this ship so that the Nine Li people can revitalize the race."</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged indifferently. "The Nine Li race will thrive again in no time.</p>

  <p>The old members of the race will all be reincarnated soon."</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me? The divine land has limited resources. There can only be a few Other Shore Realm warriors, and their strength wouldn't amount to anything in the Source World. Besides..." Zheng tried to focus on the surrounding view as No. 9527 went into a frenzied sermon, furiously listing in points all the repercussions if he were to stay at the universe.</p>

  <p>As he got tired of the seemingly never-ending lecture, Zheng finally interrupted No. 9527. "All right, calm down. I was joking. You know I'm going to the Source World."</p>

  <p>Zheng could never forget the first time he had heard of what had happened to Chiyou. He died doing what he had been for a long time— fighting. The Yellow Emperor race, however, turned out to be his last opponent. More so than that, Zheng accepted his mother Lorena's decision not to say anything regarding the matter, though he knew that she still had her own thoughts.</p>

  <p>After all, she would never allow the Nine Li race to forever hide within the chaos.</p>

  <p>Like many things, however, it is always easier said than done. First of all, detailed preparation was needed for the trip to the Source World. Every action, turn, possibility— as much as possible, they must all be taken into account.</p>

  <p>Their trip to the Evolutionary Universe was almost over when Zheng released his restriction on Lewis. He told Lewis that he could go to the Celestial Position race after reaching the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race had fulfilled Mike's mission, and was now acting as Mike's agent in the Evolutionary Universe. And if Lewis did join the race, there was no doubt he'd eventually be able to enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>Lewis was confident of his abilities and thrilled about the invitation. He felt even better when he heard that Tianming was reincarnated as an infant. Lewis then swore that he would enter the divine land and prove the Godly Way, all before Tianming came of age.</p>

  <p>After sending Lewis off into the Upper World, Zheng took a brief pause and reflected upon the brief journey. He then quietly left the Evolutionary Universe with his women.</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship, blending in with the serene skies, quietly floated above the Time Sea, near the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Everyone took their time to rest. By the time Emily's broken arm healed, most of the Other Shore Realm warriors had also recovered from their injuries.</p>

  <p>Though its craftsmanship boasted sturdiness and fortitude, Emily touched it delicately, as if it were something incredibly precious. "Clement certainly came all the way to provide us with such a good gift."</p>

  <p>Timotheus glanced at his surroundings, appraising the ship. "Yes, it would save us a great deal of time in our trip to the Source World."</p>

  <p>The chaos was so huge that even a warrior at the Other Shore Realm would take a long time to go to the Source World.</p>

  <p>Some warriors at the Other Shore Realm who had escaped prison along with Emily, Timotheus, and the others were, in fact, still fleeing in the chaos.</p>

  <p>"If you fly toward the Source World as fast as you can, how long would it take to get there?" Zheng asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Emily glanced towards Zheng and immediately did the calculations in her head. "Well, if I fly at full speed, I need about ten thousand to twenty thousand years to get to the Source World."</p>

  <p>Ten to twenty thousand years to get to the Source World?</p>

  <p>Zheng practically felt his jaw drop.</p>

  <p>"Well, that estimate's actually ideal. Emily needs to rest for a while after flying long distances, especially at full speed. If we consider that, then it would definitely take longer," Leopold interjected. "The Trumpet Flying Ship's different, though. It runs through space countlessly faster than an ordinary warrior at the Other Shore Realm."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Ramzi climbed down the Trumpet Flying Ship with a serious look on his face.</p>

  <p>"How's it going?" Leopold asked as he saw Ramzi's expression.</p>

  <p>"This ship needs divine crystals to fly, but I haven't found any," Ramzi replied sullenly.</p>

  <p>Emily didn't look surprised. "The Slaughtering Moonlight Array is very powerful. They must have exhausted the supply of divine crystals when they activated the array."</p>

  <p>Ramzi nodded and replied, "We can find another way to get divine crystals.</p>

  <p>More importantly, I found a tracking array in the ship, and it was activated."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm warriors immediately turned serious upon hearing this.</p>

  <p>Leopold frowned. "I'm afraid that the tracking array will expose the divine land's location."</p>

  <p>Zheng also couldn't believe the news. He felt his heart quicken and skip a beat.</p>

  <p>The divine land had already been disturbed by the sudden arrival of people led by Clement. If more Other Shore Realm warriors or even strong warriors of Bear race came, the divine land would suffer more than it presently had.</p>

  <p>Ramzi shook his head. "It's not so bad. Although the tracking array is on, the Bear race only knows that Clement died here. They wouldn't know what exactly happened. The chaos is so huge, after all. Maybe they would think Clement and his men died of fierce beasts."</p>

  <p>Timotheus turned to Zheng. "But Clement was influential within the Bear race. His death would attract a lot of attention, and an investigation will be inevitable. The divine land certainly should not stay here."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "Then I'll transfer the divine land to another location as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"We shouldn't waste time," Emily added. "Given the circumstances, we should hide the divine land from others as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>In fact, the divine land was bigger and quicker than the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had first entered the sun, he had changed the entire divine land's flight trajectory, stopping it from falling towards the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Back then, Emily had discovered the divine land. She had gathered the Other Shore Realm warriors of the Snake Goddess race and bound it to the bone tower. After she had released this restriction later, the divine land had gradually distanced itself from the bottom of the chaos. However, with no one to take charge, it moved extremely slowly.</p>

  <p>Zheng understood the seriousness of the matter. Without any hesitation, he disappeared on the spot.</p>

  <p>Not a moment later, he appeared inside the sun.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng did not need to use the Sun-resisting Umbrella Harper had given him. He had fused with the original will, and even the Sun Essence Flame in the sun's depths could not harm him.</p>

  <p>Since this was the second time he was here, Zheng easily crossed the palace and walked past the Chiyou statue. He was standing in front of the seven rings in no time.</p>

  <p>Zheng put his consciousness into the rings straight away. As he did so, each ring started to wrap around him— his neck, arms, legs, waist...</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng's head was suddenly filled with an image of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>As Zheng gently lifted his hand, the once unshakeable divine land started to quiver and turn slowly to the other side.</p>
