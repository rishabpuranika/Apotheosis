<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi immediately understood what was behind the Black Ship captain's words.</p>

  <p>Until then, he had been misinterpreting things? the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits weren't used to strengthen one's power. Instead, they were necessary when something needed to descend into the chaos.</p>

  <p>"And what if I refuse the exchange?" Fuxi then asked.</p>

  <p>Thirty golden red Chaotic Source Spirits remained in Yan's hands. As far as he knew, Luo Zheng had obtained most of the remaining spirits.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether or not the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits were of great use, Fuxi didn't think it necessary to make the deal with the Black Ship's captain.</p>

  <p>He was there to make him hand over the Descending Rings, not make a deal with the man.</p>

  <p>"If you don't agree to my terms of exchange, you will never get the Descending Rings from me, believe it or not!" replied the captain of the Black Ship. "The chaos is vast," he added. "It will be easy for me to hide several Descending Rings from you."</p>

  <p>Fuxi's face darkened, and a cruel glint flashed in his eyes. He began gathering his power as he threatened, "It seems you're still unwilling to admit defeat."</p>

  <p>"Admit defeat?" The Black Ship's captain only smiled faintly and said,</p>

  <p>"Human Sovereign, you truly have the power to be confident. But have you ever considered why it was so easy for you to find the Black Ship that comes and goes without a trace in the Source World?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi's face seemed to turn cautious upon hearing this. Quietly, he took a look around and examined his surroundings.</p>

  <p>A black wisp of aura circled the place? something he had failed to detect because of the dark surroundings.</p>

  <p>The captain's intent was clear? he knew that Fuxi was tracking the Black Ship, so he had purposely set a trap for Fuxi, giving himself a chance to negotiate with the latter about the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"I don't have many spirits with me," Fuxi said, stretching out his hand.</p>

  <p>The only one he had received from Yan then appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>Two golden beams of light flashed under the captain's cloak. "How many more of them can you get," he asked, sounding excited.</p>

  <p>"About thirty," Fuxi answered.</p>

  <p>He reported only the number of Chaotic Source Spirits in Yan's hand. While he could ask Luo Zheng for more, Fuxi didn't want the Black Ship's captain to get his hands on too many.</p>

  <p>"We want all of them," claimed the captain of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you're being too greedy?" Fuxi said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I know you can get more if you want," answered the other nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>While the Black Ship had plans to plunder Luo Zheng's, they hadn't had time to carry them out. Even without mentioning Luo Zheng, though, his threat was clear as day.</p>

  <p>"Alright, I'll give you all of them. But you have to tell me what's wrong with the Descending Rings," Fuxi demanded calmly.</p>

  <p>After killing the Thunder Dimorphodon, Fuxi had tried to scour the beast's memory.</p>

  <p>But it had used a secret technique to jumble up its memories, setting a trap in its soul before it could be killed.</p>

  <p>It was this trap Fuxi nearly fell into as he extracted the beast's memories.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I will tell you about it. But everything must be done in accordance with the contract?" The captain spoke, rolling up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>From under his sleeve, a living Other Shore Token slowly crawled out, revealing a twin-headed snake.</p>

  <p>Its scales were of two brilliant colors? the head on the left was a bright red while the head on the right was a deep blue. The snake hissed aggressively out in the open.</p>

  <p>"Is this? a Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake?" Once Fuxi identified the snake, his expression was flooded with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Human Sovereign, once you return to the Li Shan mountain, I won't be able to touch you. To honor our contract, please choose a snake head!" announced the captain of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>The Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake was an Other Shore Token of Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. It was the kind with strange habits and exceptionally powerful abilities.</p>

  <p>Usually, it appeared before warriors who encountered desperate situations on Stage Thirty-three, otherwise known as the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>Previously, Fuxi had been forced into a desperate situation, having been chased by a swarm of powerful bees in a pool of the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>At the very end of the pool, he bumped into a Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake that had offered to bail him out of danger, but he was required to complete a task for it in return.</p>

  <p>Back then, Fuxi was left with no choice but to accept the terms? it was his means of survival.</p>

  <p>Once he agreed, the twin-headed snake followed through on its end of the contract.</p>

  <p>And afterwards, to keep his promise, Fuxi spent five to six thousand years on the edge of the Three Purities Stage to complete the snake's contract.</p>

  <p>No one knew of the snake's nature? it seemed to appear before those who needed help.</p>

  <p>It was a miraculous creature.</p>

  <p>Some regarded it as a kind of mascot, while others saw it as a curse. But fulfilling its contracts was no easy task. Breaching it also meant a terrible price.</p>

  <p>Most people who had been to the Three Purities Stage had either witnessed or heard of this magical creature.</p>

  <p>But no one had ever managed to fuse with it as an Other Shore Token for them to carry in their inner world and bring to the chaos.</p>

  <p>As the snake twisted its body, the red head suddenly spoke out in human language, "The contract is bound by lethal poison. So long as you keep your promise, the poison will be detoxified! Choose a snake head and make your contract now!"</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference to me," Fuxi exclaimed.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, he rushed to the deck and reached out to the twin-headed snake.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The red snake head then bit Fuxi's arm at lightning speed. Its venomous fangs didn't pierce the skin, instead, it left a unique bite mark.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the blue snake head bit on the captain's arm.</p>

  <p>And so the contract and its restrictions came into effect at the same time.</p>

  <p>Both Fuxi and the Black Ship's captain were under their influence completely.</p>

  <p>Once they were bound to the contract, the Black Ship's captain handed three Descending Rings to Fuxi as he explained, "These Descending Rings indeed help Other Shore creatures descend into the chaos, but they can't avoid the punishment of the truth. I've tried several times? every creature that descends into the chaos ends up being eradicated by the truth."</p>

  <p>He promptly detailed the results of using the Descending Rings to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>As Fuxi listened to his explanations, he realized that if it were him, he'd attribute the problem to the lack of golden red Chaotic Source Spirits as well? he understood why the captain of the Black Ship wanted to obtain them.</p>

  <p>But a thought came to his mind just then, and his expression changed upon remembering it.</p>

  <p>It was no secret that Luo Zheng had obtained most of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Both the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race must have known of it.</p>

  <p>If the Xuanyuan along with the others also aimed at the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, that meant Luo Zheng and the Taiyi Heaven Palace would also likely be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>"Please send your men to the Li Shan mountain. I will ask someone to hand over the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits to you. I need to leave now!" After cupping hands, Fuxi employed the Grand Teleportation technique to quickly travel through the chaos.</p>

  <p>"He is in such a hurry?looks like he figured it out, but it's all too late," murmured the Black Ship's captain once Fuxi left. "I bet the Taiyi Heaven Palace must have been conquered by now."</p>

  <p>As Fuxi chased after the Black Ship, it had kept a close eye on the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>So he knew all there was to know about the war between the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>But the result hadn't yet reached the Black Ship's captain? he believed that the Taiyi Heaven Palace was doomed.</p>
