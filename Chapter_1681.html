<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>But Mu Ning was already thinking ahead of others. When she noticed that the white stone's placement wasn't anything strategic, she gently stepped down from the stone and stood on the board.</p>

  <p>By just making it up to this point, she had already achieved the goal that her master had set for her.</p>

  <p>Her master didn't require her to exert herself.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this was not a knockout round so she didn't have to fight her opponent. Besides, she was slack in martial arts cultivation, so it was better for her not to face Nathan.</p>

  <p>As soon as she stepped onto the board, she smiled sweetly and was ready to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>For many, Mu Ning made a wise decision. They understood her intention considering the two recent moves. And who would want to face Nathan head-on?</p>

  <p>But before Mu Ning could announce her surrender, Nathan cut her off and spoke, "Mu Ning, it's a great honor to spar with you!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Mu Ning blinked in confusion. She smiled at him and explained, "You see, I have no intention to fight you. I admit defeat-"</p>

  <p>"You can't!" Nathan interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Mu Ning was confused. Why couldn't she admit defeat? Was it against any rule?</p>

  <p>Nathan said with a faint smile, "Mu Ning, do you know that the situation on the Heaven Earth Board predicts our future?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. You don't have to tell me," she replied dully. As a Go master, Mu Ning had fully understood the meaning of this game.</p>

  <p>However, she did not care about it at all or anything about the conflicts in the universe. She thought that those had nothing to do with her. The only reason she was here was because of the man she loved and she just wished to stay by his side forever.</p>

  <p>Nathan was somehow disappointed by her indifferent reaction. But he then walked towards the other side of the board and said, "I've mastered not only martial arts but also astrology and divination. Look at the territory here! A white stone was captured here because you defeated that warrior!"</p>

  <p>He pointed at a circle of black stones. There once stood an ace talent whom Mu Ning had defeated.</p>

  <p>But Mu Ning said nothing in reply and just stared at Nathan with a more confused look. She felt perplexed because he didn't answer her question directly. She was getting more and more annoyed at Nathan. However, it would be impolite to interrupt his explanation, so she had no other choice but to keep listening.</p>

  <p>Nathan then pointed at another corner and continued, "And here! Several black stones were captured here because I defeated those warriors!</p>

  <p>Although these two territories seem unconnected, they are truly the foundations of the succeeding moves!"</p>

  <p>At first, everyone didn't get what Nathan was trying to explain. They were all confused just like Mu Ning. However, after he explained it this way, they began to realize what he wanted to prove.</p>

  <p>After that, Nathan suddenly looked up at the sky. "If I guessed it right, both sides are going to defend their territories by competing in a line.</p>

  <p>And this is a joint effort of our previous moves! And that could only mean?"</p>

  <p>He cleared his throat but didn't finish what he wanted to say.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if he was speaking to both Mu Ning and the mysterious woman, but he was addressing the entire universe.</p>

  <p>The faces of the wise men from the audience lit up when they finally realized the gist of Nathan's explanation.</p>

  <p>Even the Supreme Lords could not believe that Nathan was able to come up with such a conclusion from the game.</p>

  <p>"This boy is truly one of the most outstanding people in the entire universe. There's no need to calculate the future of this world of chaos.</p>

  <p>He'll be number one!"</p>

  <p>"What a shame! Although I'm a Supreme Lord who have lived for hundreds of millions of years, I was wrong in my interpretation of the game. Indeed, this boy has a much deeper insight than me!"</p>

  <p>"Nathan, once again, you've made me proud! You never let me down!"</p>

  <p>The audience became loud as the Supreme Lords shared their praises towards Nathan at the same time. Their praises had spread throughout the entire universe through the Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>The only people who couldn't hear their voices were the remaining eleven warriors in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was still lost with Nathan's theory. Although she clearly understood the game of Go, she knew nothing about the arts of calculation and prediction so she couldn't understand Nathan's words at all.</p>

  <p>"To be honest, I don't understand a word you're saying. I don't have time to fight you, so I have got to go! Bye!" she said.</p>

  <p>Despite Nathan's impassioned speech, Mu Ning turned around and left without the slightest hesitation. Once she returned to the black stone, she would be considered to have given up on this fight.</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't expect that Mu Ning would leave immediately. But he insisted on making her stay to fight and called her back. "Wait a minute!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning turned around with her eyebrows raised and face filled with impatience. This time, she couldn't hide her anger towards Nathan, "Just tell it to me directly! Stop beating around the bush! I don't understand what you're trying to imply!"</p>

  <p>"I mean, this game of Go not only represents the future of the universe but also indicates the fates of the eleven people here. Don't you know?</p>

  <p>We are now the protagonists of this world of chaos. And your fate is closely intertwined with mine, so you will be my woman in the future!"</p>

  <p>Nathan tried to explain it as straightforward as possible to Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Despite the awkwardness of the situation, his face remained calm.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Mu Ning stood there dumbfounded and stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>Nathan tried to remain composed. He was radiating with overflowing confidence. He knew he was a man of great charm. And now that he was part of the top eleven, there was no denying that he had become every woman's dream. Now, he couldn't imagine how Mu Ning would react to his confession. Would she jump for joy? Would she kiss and hug him?</p>

  <p>But contrary to what he anticipated, Mu Ning asked with disdain, "Are you nuts?"</p>
