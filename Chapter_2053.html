<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2053 Trapped (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were divided into three ranks, top-rank, mid-rank, and low-rank. However, the division of ranks was not based on one's cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the cultivation level of Supreme Lords was equal to that of grand world lords. After their respective inner worlds had expanded several times, they would gradually come to a standstill. What truly made Supreme Lords surpass the world lords were their Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the difference among the top-rank Supreme Lord, the mid-rank Supreme Lord, and the low-rank Supreme Lord lay in the distinction of the power of their Heavenly Destinies. Instead of cultivation level, the strength of their Heavenly Destinies would be the basis of a Supreme Lord's rank.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel's Heavenly Destiny actually possessed the 'summoning' ability. That sort of Heavenly Destiny was one of the weaker types. Amongst Supreme Lords, Supreme Lord Denzel was ranked near the bottom. With his ranking in consideration, he wouldn't even be qualified to become a mid-rank Supreme Lord!</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Denzel was still able to become a top-rank Supreme Lord because of the unique nature of the altar. Its immense power and mysterious ability had guided Supreme Lord Denzel to climb the ranks.</p>

  <p>The wild beasts of Sacred race that were summoned from this altar were all destructively mighty. The strength of every single wild beast was comparable to that of a low-rank Supreme Lord. The special abilities some Sacred wild beasts possessed could even be similar to the Heavenly Destinies of mid-rank Supreme Lords. It only meant that Supreme Lord Denzel had access to such a mighty army of beasts!</p>

  <p>For example, the beast that was directly trampled into pieces by Master Feng, was also a formidable and fierce beast.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng fought it one on one, he might not necessarily gain the upper hand. The beast was strong enough to survive a fight with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, Master Feng showed up with the Evolution Lotus Flower. Great passion was reflected in his eyes as he strived to save the universe. His power was incomparably strong. Along with his move, he had managed to stomp the beast, which had a tiger's head and bull's body into smithereens.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race didn't expect the Celestial Position to make a move at that moment. Supreme Lord Denzel also revealed a stunned expression.</p>

  <p>However, he immediately seemed to have understood something as he cried out with alert eyes, "Damn! Everyone, withdraw quickly..."</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race still amounted to more than fifty.</p>

  <p>Behind the Supreme Lords was the Murphy Universe that supported them. Although they had invaded deep into the Evolutionary Universe, the True God and the many Supreme Lords in the Murphy Universe were still on standby.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't take too long for the Sacred Supreme Lords to arrive there with the Grand Teleportation. As for the True God, he could even arrive in the blink of an eye! Their mobility was definitely fast.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Sacred race never thought that the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe would make a move at that moment. Master Feng's arrival had surprised them!</p>

  <p>Because the leader of the Celestial Position had made his move, all the other Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe would definitely follow behind him. The forces of the Evolutionary Universe had started to move!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Denzel didn't know that the passage towards the Sighing Wall had already been sealed by Wynn. However, he was still able to make his own judgment. Since the leader of the Celestial Position dared to launch a surprise attack at him, he must have made full preparations…</p>

  <p>That was the reason why Supreme Lord Denzel ordered everyone to withdraw at the first possible moment! His intelligent analysis and quick judgment were products from his experience.</p>

  <p>However, before he could finish his sentence, the stars in the sky started to shine with brilliant light. The stars radiated power with their brightness.</p>

  <p>"Stars in the sky, listen to my command. Use your powers to seal the worlds forever! Star Sealing Technique!"</p>

  <p>With the use of the Grand Teleportation, a True God could cross a universe and reach another universe. It took Wynn a few seconds to seal the passage to the Sighing Wall. When he finally reached the Sunflower Water World, Wynn once again used the Star Sealing Technique to completely seal the entire supreme world. The preparations were finally complete!</p>

  <p>It was far too tricky for a Supreme Lord to kill another Supreme Lord. If two Supreme Lords fought and one was about to lose, he could still escape death. The loser could quickly flee to a safe place trillion miles away with the use of the Grand Teleportation. If the Supreme Lords from the Sacred race managed to escape, then the whole thing would become complicated. It would take a long time to hunt for the escaped Supreme Lords of the Sacred race and kill them. Once, it had taken four hundred years for three Supreme Lords of the human race to kill a Supreme Lord from a small race…</p>

  <p>For example, back then, Supreme Lord Leroy had been chased down by the warriors of the Demon Night and had escaped right under their noses.</p>

  <p>Since then, he had hidden deep underground for many years. The Grand Teleportation had ensured his escape and preserved his life.</p>

  <p>However, Wynn was a True God, after all! His power was definitely stronger than the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>After he used the Star Sealing Technique, even a True God would find it difficult to break free from it. It would be even much tough for the Supreme Lords that were present there. With Wynn's technique, all of them were trapped there. There was no way for them to retreat!</p>

  <p>"Crack…" dozens of Sacred Supreme Lords hurriedly activated Greater Teleportation with great panic. However, before the space channels created by the Grand Teleportation could take into shape, they were immediately disintegrated under their feet…</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, crap! Those bastards! The space around us has been sealed!" a Supreme Lord said in a daze. Terror was apparent from his expression.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? Who has the ability to seal off our space?!" another Supreme Lord said in disbelief as his eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"It must be a True God!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race were usually arrogant, haughty, and calm. However, in a life and death moment, a small portion of them revealed their true nature. They were flustered as they didn't know how to deal with their predicament.</p>
