</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As a series of marks enveloped Zheng, he pulled back the string of the Sun Shooting Bow once more.</p>

  <p>Aiming carefully, he released the string. The seemingly ordinary arrow slowly shot towards the center of the sun.</p>

  <p>In a flash of black light, the huge sun suddenly went out.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer, Yellow Thearch, and other powerful warriors all watched quietly. Despite their calm expressions, there was a trace of shock in their eyes.</p>

  <p>It was not that they were surprised that an entire sun had been destroyed almost effortlessly. After all, with their experience, they had seen all kinds of things.</p>

  <p>Even if dozens of provinces were destroyed right in front of them, they wouldn't have batted an eyelash.</p>

  <p>However, it was Zheng's method of shooting the sun that unsettled them.</p>

  <p>"Is it an Other Shore Token?" Divine Farmer asked, his eyes narrowing.</p>

  <p>"It must be," answered Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch shook his head. "The Other Shore Token that can shoot the suns with arrows doesn't exist below the Three Purities Stage. Moreover, he can't possibly be carrying any Other Shore Token from the Three Purities Stage."</p>

  <p>Several masters behind Yellow Thearch nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>While they all might have seen some extraordinary things in their time, there were indeed still many mysteries in this world.</p>

  <p>The powerhouses present, however, were at the top of the Source World and the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>There weren't many things that could shock them, and yet...</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Just as the many powerful warriors were deep in thought, suddenly, the eye appeared once more in the huge crack beside them.</p>

  <p>It seemed the eye was also taking in the scene that was transmitted by Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"Goo..."</p>

  <p>"He can do it. He can see it. It's the space outside the space..."</p>

  <p>The voice thundered from the crack, ringing in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>As the Chaos Ancient God in charge of space, he boasted of the keenest sense of space in the entire Source World. Having watched this scene unfold right before him, he felt somewhat unsettled.</p>

  <p>"What's the space outside the space?" Yellow Thearch asked.</p>

  <p>The huge eye in the crack paused for a moment before answering, "I don't know. It's another kind of space rule, surpassing the space truth."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Surpass the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Is there anything in this world that surpasses the truth?"</p>

  <p>The several masters behind Yellow Thearch whispered amongst themselves anxiously.</p>

  <p>However, Emperor Charm, Divine Farmer, and the leader of the New Moon race still kept their composure.</p>

  <p>After they decided to follow the Element Spirit race, the latter had revealed some very special information about the origin of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, truth was an unbreakable rule in this world. However, it was possible something out there was even more powerful than truth.</p>

  <p>"This man must die," Emperor Charm said quietly, as he stared at Zheng on the screen.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer stared at Yellow Thearch and said, "Your Bearing race and the Sun Crow race are attacking the Oneness Sky Palace together this time.</p>

  <p>Can you order your people to capture Zheng?"</p>

  <p>When they planned to destroy the Oneness Sky Palace, their original goal was to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, whereas capturing Zheng was only a second priority.</p>

  <p>But now that Divine Farmer realized how dangerous Zheng truly was, he felt that capturing him should be of utmost priority.</p>

  <p>Zheng's ability was so strange that he couldn't even begin to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>"My people are trying to enter the Bloom Divine Province from the other side. I'm afraid they are busy breaking the arrays now," Yellow Thearch said with a frown. "At this point, it won't be easy to capture Zheng."</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm turned to look at the huge sun and pursed his lips. His eyes flashed coldly. "I have a simple solution. I'll go there myself."</p>

  <p>The members of the Sun Crow race were interconnected, and they could easily sense each other's existence. As the king of the Sun Crow race, Emperor Charm had the sharpest senses.</p>

  <p>He could clearly feel the existence of Elizabeth, Micah, Bagot and others.</p>

  <p>They were still alive, but he could tell that there was something strange going on with them.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating, Emperor Charm spread his massive wings.</p>

  <p>The surrounding space formed tiny grids, and he left the abyss at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Ever since the transmission array was destroyed, chaos erupted in the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>Although many powerful warriors were still trying their best to build the enchanted barriers, feelings of desperation and helplessness hung in the air.</p>

  <p>Everyone was keenly aware that they were about to be burned to death. It was only a matter of time.</p>

  <p>Looking at the blazing white sky, Auden frowned deeply. Turning to Elizabeth, he asked, "I know that your Sun Crow race isn't just good with flames, but also has an affinity with space." Pausing for a moment, he continued, "Can you create a space to avoid all this?"</p>

  <p>While they had submitted to the Emperor Charm in Zheng's body, they still felt quite hostile towards the humans.</p>

  <p>However, since this was a matter of life and death for everyone, the Sun Crow race had decided to join forces with them. They were either activating the enchanted barriers, or at the very least, helping stabilize them.</p>

  <p>"It's useless." Elizabeth shook her head. "When the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy is activated, everything in the province, including the space, will be destroyed."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she pointed towards the sky.</p>

  <p>While ordinary people could only see the sky as a blinding, blazing white light, Elizabeth and Auden could see cracks forming.</p>

  <p>It seemed the flames were so powerful that they burned even space itself.</p>

  <p>Auden's frown deepened. Was there really no way out?</p>

  <p>"Don't you still have that man?" Elizabeth said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>After saying this, she suddenly felt a chill run down her spine. It seemed her instincts were telling her to not speak ill of "that man".</p>

  <p>"You mean Zheng?" Auden smiled bitterly. "While he has indeed created many miracles, he can't solve every problem. It'd be wishful thinking to expect such a junior to deactivate Emperor Charm's Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy..."</p>

  <p>However, before he was even able to finish speaking, the blazing white light in the sky suddenly dimmed.</p>

  <p>All the people in the North Mysterious City turned to look towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Although the sky was still blazing white, they noticed one out of the nine suns was missing.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's eyes widened. She scanned the atmosphere, thinking the ninth sun had probably shifted its position.</p>

  <p>Auden too stared at the sky. Just like Elizabeth, he had guessed that one sun had ended up blocking the other. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined someone had shot it down.</p>

  <p>As they both scanned the sky intently, the sky darkened even more, and another sun disappeared.</p>

  <p>"The suns are being extinguished!" someone shouted. Auden pursed his lips dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, two of them were extinguished!"</p>

  <p>"There is hope. We must hold on. The suns will definitely be extinguished!"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Two suns had disappeared. While they didn't know how or why, finally, the people in the North Mysterious City felt a surge of hope.</p>
