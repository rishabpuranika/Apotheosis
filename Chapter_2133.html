  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng kept on falling down, colliding with random things in his way.</p>

  <p>The things found in the divine land were a thousand times bigger than those in the universe. So if a mountain collapsed, the impact would without a doubt send a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior or even a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior to death.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body was considered quite strong, so he didn't get injured when he fell. The damage to him was that he became involved in the conflict between Master Evil and Yorick.</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>It turned out that there was a huge cave tucked under the Black Wind Ridge. Apparently, Master Evil set this place up as his lair because of its remoteness and covertness.</p>

  <p>He used the Sealing Machine in the past to completely seal the cave.</p>

  <p>Historically, only Yorick had attempted to sneak into this cave to open the Sealing Machine and take the treasure. However, Master Evil's Sealing Machine was designed so ingeniously that it remained almost impossible for anyone to take the treasure out the Sealing Machine without destroying it. Because of this, Yorick waited for seven divine eras in the Vast Sky Region, and Master Evil finally came back.</p>

  <p>However, the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village were completely unaware of this. Their ancestors came to the Black Wind Ridge in the hopes to reclaim the land. They wanted to turn Black Wind Ridge into a small village, where the members of the Misty Mountain Village would reside for generations.</p>

  <p>The thing was because Yorick and Master Evil were at war in that place, the mountain collapsed.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Luo Zheng, Yorick and Master Evil proved to be unable to fly in the divine land too. At this moment, they started falling into the cave with Luo Luo Zheng beside them.</p>

  <p>Notably, the two of them were both mid-rank True Gods, so they were much stronger than Luo Luo Zheng. Amidst a pile of rubble and ashes, Master Evil and Yorick continued to battle one another.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Luo Luo Zheng finally dropped down to the bottom of the cave and was buried under the sand. The sand and stones found in the divine land were always extremely heavy. Though there seemed to be only a few stones above him, he felt as if tens of thousands of mountains were pressing down on him, inhibiting him from moving.</p>

  <p>He mimicked an earthworm to wriggle himself out.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was finally able to stick his head out, he spat out all the sand and dirt from his mouth with a loud "Bleh". Then, he took advantage of the faint light that shot down from the top of the cave to scan the cave.</p>

  <p>The cave was not big, probably around one thousand feet wide. In the center of the cave, there was a ball about ten feet in diameter, and in that ball, there seemed to be a strand of light which kept flickering within it, going from bright to dark and then from dark to bright, like a firefly constantly emitting light.</p>

  <p>'There's actually a living being inside this ball? Is this the treasure that Master Evil is going to take away?' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Outside there were a few light swords around three feet long. They slowly floated around the ball, in a defensive way. However, the dimness of the swords made it seem like they had already lost the power that they should have.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Luo Zheng came to his senses. This ball was the Sealing Machine set up by Master Evil. It was a secret technique that had been passed down throughout the entire region, and something Master Evil had obtained by chance.</p>

  <p>As everyone knew, the Sealing Machine was very ingenious in design. If the treasure was sealed inside, it could only be opened by the person who arranged it. If someone attempted to open the ball with the wrong methods, the light swords around the ball would activate, instantly destroying the treasure inside.</p>

  <p>That was the reason Yorick had stayed hidden for a few days. After Master Evil undid the seal on the Sealing Machine, the light swords lost their effects and this gave him a chance to fight for the treasure.</p>

  <p>"Shoo..."</p>

  <p>On the opposite side of the cave, Master Evil waved the pair of devil claws. Black smoke billowed into the air and intense evil thoughts were released, as if there was a devil present.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had also probably noticed what happened to the Sealing Machine. Seeing that the light swords were weakened, he pulled a long face and was eager to fight Yorick.</p>

  <p>Yorick was slightly stronger than Master Evil. His feather fan was like a white cloud, which could easily remove Master Evil's attack. However, as Master Evil tried his best to fight Yorick, he made the latter continuously retreat.</p>

  <p>"Yorick, I have done all sorts of evil deeds in the past, but I didn't offend your Vitality Sect in the slightest. When the Ghost Sect wanted to attack your Vitality Sect back then, I even stopped them. Today, you repay me by taking away my treasure?" Master Evil's teeth was clenching as he said this, his mind filled with all nasty thoughts.</p>

  <p>As Yorick waved his fan, he said flatly, "There is no other way. The item sealed in the Sealing Machine is too important. Anyone would try to take it away if they know about it. You are not my opponent, so consider giving the treasure up. How about I give you other compensation?"</p>

  <p>"What a joke!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil let out an evil laugh, his jet black hair fluttering behind him as he uttered, "Back then, it was because of the treasure that I offended Bromley, and I was imprisoned for seven divine eras before I was able to escape. Do you think I should give it to you just like that? Who do you think I am?"</p>

  <p>Yorick laughed coldly. "If you don't give it to me, I will take it," he said.</p>

  <p>"And I will not only take away your treasure, but also your life. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Yorick finished speaking, he took a few quick steps back and flipped the fan in his hand.</p>

  <p>A layer of light suddenly appeared across the surface of the white feather fan. As the cyan light rippled, it formed into a ghost face. The ghost face's eyes were full of smiles, but its mouth was drooping downwards, looking extremely bizarre and frightening. It was not a sight for the faint hearted.</p>

  <p>When the ghost face appeared, Yorick turned the fan around once again, and another ghost face appeared on the other side of the feather fan. In contrast, this ghost face's eyes were filled with tears, not smiles. It was equally horrifying to see.</p>

  <p>After the two ghost faces appeared, Yorick's expression began to disfigure itself. Half of his face was filled with happiness, while the other half was filled with grief. It was as if his face was split into two.</p>

  <p>"Moody Ghost!"</p>

  <p>Before this, Yorick had used the fan in his hand to deal with the enemy all the time, but in the end, he didn't dare to face Master Evil head on.</p>

  <p>When his face was finally formed, he charged forward. He dodged Master Evil's devil claws with a palm blade, and chopped horizontally forward.</p>

  <p>"BOOM!"</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Following a muffled sound, the devil claw on Master Evil's right hand suddenly fell to the ground. His bones were shattered and easily seen as Yorick seemed to have chopped it off.</p>

  <p>"I have told you countless times," exclaimed Yorick. "If you want to die, don't blame me for killing you." An evil grin plastered across his face as he sent out another palm strike.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The second palm blade landed on the shoulder of Master Evil. Half the bones in his body were crushed within him as he crashed into a rock on the side of the cave. This created a hole in the rock as his body fell through it, tens of feet deep.</p>

  <p>This was surprising, because the toughness of the rocks in the divine land was similar to that of the Dark Star.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng did not use the strength source, he knew it would take some effort to break these rocks apart.</p>

  <p>It was odd. It seemed as if the rocks became weakened during the battle between Yorick and Master Evil. How could he have slammed into the rock so deeply?</p>

  <p>"Crack."</p>

  <p>Just then, an extremely faint cracking sound rang from within the ball.</p>

  <p>Yorick and Master Evil had been in the middle of their battle, so they failed to even notice.</p>

  <p>From a distance, Luo Luo Zheng was able to see everything clearly. A small crack developed down the ball, as if the treasure within was trying to break out of it. What could it be?</p>

  <p>    </p>
