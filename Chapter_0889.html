<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 889 The Game Of War (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng smiled and shrugged. "You don't need to thank me. We're in different positions."</p>

  <p>After the ogres had left, Fabian said to Zheng in a low voice, "Zheng, will the Demon Night really aid our Purple Heart Sacred Place?"</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see. Besides, if the Demon Night doesn't help, I can choose not to drive the ogres out of the Tower of Sin," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's words made Fabian extremely uneasy. No matter what, he had to send this news to the Purple Heart Sacred Place as soon as possible, so that they could prepare in advance!</p>

  <p>On the Sea God Continent, an intense game of war now raged around the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Even though the Sea God Continent was an extremely chaotic place, the past ten years had been a peaceful time. Except for the constant expansion of both the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place in their territories, the other races were all relatively stable and peaceful.</p>

  <p>In the face of the growing oppression by the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, the other races had been forced to keep their resentments to themselves. Whether it was in the Tower of Sin or on the Sea God Continent, the many races could only suffer the expansion of the ogres in silence and tolerate them bitterly.</p>

  <p>Recently, there were new movements from the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place. The two sacred places had actually declared an open war on the Purple Heart Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>This unprecedented breaking news shocked trillions of creatures on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>The sacred place of the Giants stood between the sacred places of the ogres and the human's Purple Heart Sacred Place. Normally, when an open war was declared among sacred places, such a war would mean that one side was going to completely wipe out the other.</p>

  <p>However, the creatures on the Sea God Continent didn't know why the ogres would suddenly wage a war against the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The destruction of the Purple Heart Sacred Place wouldn't do much good for ogres, not to mention that there was still the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place which was situated behind the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>All sorts of reports and analyses were being researched in every sacred place. Of course, the other races wouldn't want to be involved. Now that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had made their collective move, the Purple Heart Sacred Place was surely doomed to be annihilated. All of the other races were happy to watch from the sidelines as they fought.</p>

  <p>However, the information which followed was something no one had expected.</p>

  <p>Purple Heart Sacred Place had actually initiated the declaration of war on the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place and the two sacred places of the ogres weren't even on the same level. What could possibly give the humans such great courage that they would declare war on the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place?</p>

  <p>The combined might of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place was like an armed adult who told a helpless kid that he wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>And the human race was that helpless kid.</p>

  <p>Right now, not only did this kid not run away, nor did he beg for mercy as expected. Instead, he declared war on that adult! This was not something that common sense could explain as their behavior was quite illogical.</p>

  <p>A war between the races was not child's play. It promised to be a war in which blood would flow like rivers. Every step that each side could take had been discussed and analyzed countless times. If the humans dared to challenge the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, then they must have someone or something powerful to rely on.</p>

  <p>However, the creatures on the Sea God Continent couldn't figure out what the humans had at their back.</p>

  <p>However, as more news was gathered, they soon realized that the person whom the human race relied on was actually Zheng!</p>

  <p>There were countless spies from the many sacred places in the Tower of Sin. They closely watched the situation unfold within the tower and were informed about every strategic movement in the tower. There were more than one hundred trillion creatures on the Sea God Continent, and there would always be some extremely wise ones among them.</p>

  <p>After the Purple Heart Sacred Place had declared war on the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, some of the more intellectually capable creatures immediately predicted that the Demon Night would also declare war on the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>As they foretold, ten days later, the Demon Night also declared war on the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>During the one month which Zheng had given the ogres to weigh and consider, the Tower of Sin continued as was usual, immersed in slaughter and plunder. It had been like this for countless decades.</p>

  <p>However, the three races of the Sea God Continent were repeatedly playing the game to test the waters.</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place was now on high alert. Many of the powerful Soul Sea Realm masters leading the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had marched towards the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>But at the same time, from the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, Amber had led a large number of their elite warriors and they landed beside the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The intention of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was very clear: if the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place attacked the Purple Heart Sacred Place, then the two ogre sacred places would also be razed to the ground by the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would suffer heavy losses itself if it was attacked by the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, they couldn't defy the order given by Xun, and now wasn't the time to consider what price they had to pay.</p>
