<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4169 Feast On The Heads </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was truly horrifying to see a massive army of heads follow behind the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Li Shan mountain, ranging from mountain leaders, sect leaders, Eternal Realm warriors, to ordinary citizens, all felt chills run down their spines.</p>

  <p>If there was even a slight mistake, the Li Shan mountain would meet its end right now.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that the chaos would be so dangerous. Was it a wrong choice for the Li Shan mountain to have left the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"The chaos should be filled with chaotic energy. Where has the chaotic energy gone, and why are there so many horrible heads?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? Maybe the Snake Goddess can answer your question... "</p>

  <p>The people on the roof of the gate tower and on the hillside couldn't do anything but look up and pray.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Until now, the Snake Goddess still did not stop luring the heads.</p>

  <p>Her shadow, which had condensed behind her, increasingly got smaller and dimmer. It had all turned into thin energy beams and floated farther away, to help Luo Zheng lure more heads.</p>

  <p>The entire Li Shan mountain was like a fishing boat that sailed in the deep sea, while the shadow of Snake Goddess was akin to a large fishing net that caught the heads one after another.</p>

  <p>"If it goes on like this, the number of heads would probably exceed a hundred million," the Snake Goddess said as she stared at Luo Zheng. "Luo Zheng, are you sure about your plan?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure.." Luo Zheng confessed.</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others were speechless.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, Luo Zheng used the mother butterfly once again to locate the primitive land. It turned out that it was already quite close.</p>

  <p>"Is that the primitive land?" the Snake Goddess suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in front of Li Shan mountain was a small, brown oblate ball. Because everyone was still a bit far from it, the ball looked like it was as tiny as a pea to their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Although his avatar in his inner world had been to the outside of the primitive land, he had not seen its entirety. It was also his first time to see what it was truly like.</p>

  <p>Blue stripes covered the brown oblate ball's surface, and there was a crack on its side. From afar, the primitive land was like an oval clamshell.</p>

  <p>"Should I control the Li Shan mountain to go there directly?" Judson asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed into slits, and he thought for a moment. Then, he nodded and said, "Yes, but don't bump into the primitive land. Control the Li Shan mountain to fly around it!"</p>

  <p>"Got it," Judson answered.</p>

  <p>The large circular structure behind the Li Shan mountain was like its helm. This circular structure controlled the direction it went. Since Judson was the one who had constructed it, he was like the captain who steered the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The large circular structure slightly tilted upwards, and the energy it released also changed its direction. In turn, the Li Shan mountain's angle changed, and it began to rush towards the bottom of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, the Li Shan mountain passed by the primitive land from below.</p>

  <p>Even though the primitive land was only one percent of the size of the Li Shan mountain, it was still a massive piece of land.</p>

  <p>When the two intersected, everyone felt as if a large city had skimmed over the top of the Li Shan mountain, then the primitive land plunged into the army of heads that followed behind the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"It's your show time," Luo Zheng said as his voice traveled over the primitive land.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had waited for a long time. The primitive land hit the large group of heads, and at the same time, the crack on its edge had opened.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of heads passively went into the primitive land.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The plants that resembled bamboo shoots intertwined then chewed the huge heads into pieces.</p>

  <p>Previously, the primitive land had devoured only a small amount of heads, and the "teeth" formed by the two rows of bamboo shoot-shaped plants were enough to deal with them. Now, the heads from the chaos arrived in a large group, and many of them still escaped from the "teeth". Worse, some of them rushed to the continents in the center after they entered the primitive land!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw that the situation had gone awry, he had no choice but to form an avatar in his inner world to protect those continents.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had also realized this problem, so it activated its power once again. Just then, a rumble came from the primitive land, and more rows of bamboo shoot-shaped plants quickly grew out. These plants shot up in a crisscross manner and occupied almost one-fourth of the primitive land, which made it hard for the heads to pass through them.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The faster the heads were devoured, the faster the primitive land expanded.</p>

  <p>By the time the primitive land eliminated the group of heads, it's size had more than doubled!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>It took nearly two hours for the massive Li Shan mountain to adjust its direction.</p>

  <p>Afterward, it drew an arc in the chaos that was ten million miles long to lure those heads towards the primitive land again.</p>

  <p>When the primitive land had doubled in size, its ability to devour heads also doubled.</p>

  <p>This was the second time the primitive land and the Li Shan mountain had passed by each other. The primitive land swallowed over a million heads, and its size doubled again. Now, it was almost one-twentieth the size of the Li Shan mountain!</p>

  <p>"The primitive land sure expands quite fast?" Fuxi muttered, his eyes full of surprise.</p>

  <p>Of course, Gerald, Judson, and Kendrick were also shocked.</p>

  <p>They had floated in the chaos for quite a long time and had seen some unique spaces within it.</p>

  <p>However, they had never seen anything as unique as Luo Zheng's primitive land!</p>

  <p>"After it swallowed two batches of heads, it expanded four times, equivalent to one-twentieth of the Li Shan mountain's size," the Snake Goddess said as her eyes lit up. "If there are enough heads for the primitive land to devour for five more times, it would be even bigger than the Li Shan mountain!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>All of them had been anxious at first, but now they were full of hope.</p>

  <p>Without saying a word, Judson adjusted the helm for the third time.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng stared at the primitive land that went further away, he asked,</p>

  <p>"Ancestry-level bloodline, why didn't those heads attack the primitive land directly? Why did they go inside the crack in the primitive land instead?"</p>

  <p>Those heads were quite insane. They bit and devoured anything they saw.</p>

  <p>However, when they reached the primitive land, they quietly bypassed the other areas and went straight inside the primitive land's big mouth. That was rather odd.</p>

  <p>"Those heads only know to devour everything, and they are quite stupid.</p>

  <p>Look at the blue lines outside the primitive land," the ancestry-level bloodline said.</p>

  <p>"These are..."</p>

  <p>"A net formed by the power of space. It can cover the whole primitive land," the ancestry-level bloodline explained.</p>

  <p>"A space net..." Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he thought of the Evil God and the Source World.</p>

  <p>Since the heads had spread all over the chaos, the Source World had probably encountered numerous attacks from them.</p>

  <p>He did not know if the Evil God had found a way to deal with them. If he did not, then the Source World would probably suffer a disaster, the tens of thousands of races and creatures that lived in it included.</p>

  <p>At that point, the Li Shan mountain had passed by the primitive land for the third time?</p>

  <p>The fourth time...</p>

  <p>The fifth time...</p>

  <p>Every time the two territories passed by each other, the primitive land's size increased, and more of the heads that followed closely behind the Li Shan mountain were subsequently devoured by the primitive land.</p>

  <p>When the Li Shan mountain passed by the primitive land for the sixth time, the latter appeared to be half the size of Li Shan mountain, and had devoured nearly one-third of the heads already!</p>

  <p>The seventh time the Li Shan mountain passed by the primitive land, half of the heads remained behind the Li Shan mountain still, but the primitive land was slightly larger than it.</p>
