  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others all agreed with the Primeval Lord of Heaven's conclusion.</p>

  <p>The arrogant Instant Civilization was stingy with clues.</p>

  <p>As for why, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others had many ideas and speculations.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess believed the reason to be very simple. The Instant Civilization was so powerful that they took the other ruling civilizations as weak and pitiful tiny bugs.</p>

  <p>Why would they leave any clues to the bugs?</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess' deduction was simple and crude, so not many agreed with it.</p>

  <p>The others didn't think it was that simple. If the Instant Civilization really looked down upon the later "bug"-like ruling civilizations that would come, they would not have made all kinds of complex rules on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>For example, the suppressive power of every stage of the Other Shore was different. If this rule was removed, the Element Spirit Civilization that had set foot on the Other Shore first, would probably have dominated the entire Other Shore and anyone who came after wouldn't have stood a chance.</p>

  <p>Not to mention the deliberate and careful arrangements such as the Soul City, the Land of Bone Tribulation and the Eternal Scroll Painting that were obviously for the promotion of the later generations.</p>

  <p>The Instant Civilization would not create such a meticulous and painstaking blueprint if they saw the future generations as bugs...</p>

  <p>The arguments about things they did not know were endless, plus the theories everyone put forward could not be proved. Thus, to this day, whether it was the human race, the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race, they had yet to understand the attitude of the Instant Civilization.</p>

  <p>"It makes sense for a key to the gates of the Soul City to be hung here," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said smiling.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the golden pot, stretched his fingers out and extinguished the flame at the mouth of the pot.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The gates of the Soul City began closing once more.</p>

  <p>As it did, all the souls began floating around, as if a banquet was about to begin.</p>

  <p>"Ah, why is it closing again?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng hasn't come out yet!"</p>

  <p>"Luckily we got out..."</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue and the others outside were overtaken with anxiety at the sight of the Soul City about to close its gates again.</p>

  <p>Seeing the ghosts about to dance in the Soul City, Luo Zheng gently tapped the candle to the mouth of the pot and lit it, igniting a faint flame as before. As he did this, the souls returned to the walls and the gates slowly opened.</p>

  <p>After lighting the flame, Luo Zheng put it out.</p>

  <p>He lit it again, and then put it out...</p>

  <p>His repetition finally aroused heated dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p>The souls that howled in the walls let out angry roars. The pair of dark blue eyes that had been immersed in the darkness appeared again. "Woo...</p>

  <p>Woo..." Luo Zheng didn't understand what they said, but from their tone he figured they were mad at his recklessness.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven was confused.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng curled his lips and said, "The golden pot must be ignited to open the city gates. Since the gates are opened every 132 hours, it means that someone must be lighting the pot every 132 hours..."</p>

  <p>The logic was simple and sound. But perhaps it was because the Primeval Lord of Heaven hadn't been surrounded by human ways of thinking for so long that he hadn't considered this himself.</p>

  <p>"The floor, door, and table of this room can't be touched," Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng reached the Holy Soul Realm, his soul was already solid and as strong as his body. All it took was a gentle touch to destroy everything in the room, which meant no one had touched it before he had.</p>

  <p>"This means that the 'person' that lit the golden pot came from above," Luo Zheng said, raising his head to look up.</p>

  <p>There didn't appear to be anything above his head except for the fist-sized stones the whole room was made up of.</p>

  <p>He stared at the stones for a moment before jumping up and putting his fingers into a crack between the stones and fixing himself on it. Holding himself up, he raised the golden pot to the stones.</p>

  <p>Under the light of the fire from the golden pot, they began to change color.</p>

  <p>The originally grayish white stones turned dark blue embellished with colorful dots of light, seeming to form a wallpaper of a colorful starry sky that spread out above the room.</p>

  <p>"It's a painting of a fish. It's really quite mysterious..." Luo Zheng said with a curious smile.</p>

  <p>All the stones glowed and it became apparent that the lights were not arranged in random. Instead, they formed the outline of a huge fish.</p>

  <p>"That's no ordinary fish. It's a roc-fish, the Starry Roc-fish!" said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, his voice trembling with excitement. He was even more exhilarated by this than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What is the Starry Roc-fish?" Luo Zheng asked inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"It's a giant sky beast that flies throughout Stage Thirty-three," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied. "When it passes by, the entire sky will change. It is a gentle and beautiful creature."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought a moment and then asked, "But Primeval Lord of Heaven, if we see the Other Shore as a special space, it would still be within the chaos.</p>

  <p>Stage Thirty-three is at the top of the chaos, then if we look up, what we see above our heads should be the ceiling, right?"</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, shaking his head in disagreement.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had first told him about King Manard, namely Ziya Jiang and the Abstruse Energy World, he wasn't all that surprised as he had seen the Abstruse Energy World in Stage Thirty-three once he raised his head!</p>

  <p>Stage Thirty-three was different from the Deleting Space. The latter was separated by a "wall" and in order to break that wall, Ziya had spent a great deal of time, using any means possible.</p>

  <p>However, there was no ceiling at the top of Stage Thirty-three. The bright dots of light above were the starry sky which was exactly the Abstruse Energy World!</p>

  <p>"Since there is no ceiling, why haven't you gone there?" Luo Zheng pressed on.</p>

  <p>This was all new to him.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had mentioned that there was also an entrance to the Abstruse Energy World in Stage Thirty-three. However, the entrance was under the control of the Element Spirit race, so there was no way for them to go that way.</p>

  <p>"Although the Abstruse Energy World is atop Stage Thirty-three, there is an invisible force field a million miles above us. The inner layer of this force field is not equal to its outer layer. When any material passes through, it will be torn to pieces as a result of this unequal pressure," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. "The force field was discovered by Fuxi, so it was named Fuxi Unequal Force Field. It covers the entire Stage Thirty-three..."</p>

  <p>"The only road to cross through the force field is controlled by the Element Spirit race," the Primeval Lord of Heaven added.</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Zheng nodded while he stared at the wall.</p>

  <p>He noticed a thin, sharp horn on the head of the Starry Roc-fish, and a flame drawn on the horn.</p>

  <p>"Flame..."</p>

  <p>"Golden pot..."</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, I think the golden pot is lit by the Starry Roc-fish," Luo Zheng said confidently.</p>
