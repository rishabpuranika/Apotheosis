  <p>
</p>

  <p>The three thousand black wind blades had only left a tiny cut on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>But only one double-colored wind blade was necessary to make a ten-foot-deep cut into the mountain.</p>

  <p>There was no getting around the fact that the difference in power of the two types of wind blades was immensely large.</p>

  <p>If a golden wind blade's power was equal to that of ten thousand double-colored wind blades, then one golden wind blade would be enough to cut right through the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>All Luo Zheng needed to do was to attract a single golden wind blade� if he managed to do so, it would save him heaps of time and energy. It would have been the perfect solution, except that there were over a hundred golden wind blades chasing after him simultaneously.</p>

  <p>If he led all of them to the mountain, their collective strength would be excessive. 'Where can I transfer all the extra power?' Luo Zheng thought in frustration, furrowing his brows.</p>

  <p>Should he transfer it to the Divine Kingdom Continent or the Central Region? The blades' terrifying power would probably wreck the Divine Kingdom Continent to pieces.</p>

  <p>Without any sound solution at the moment, Luo Zheng decided to flee.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, he had fast enough reflexes and a quick mind� right after noticing the golden blades were after him, he flew as fast and far as he could to evade them in an instant. With that, he made sure to maintain a safe distance from the threat behind him� in spite of all the precautions he had taken, the thought of a hundred golden blades flying after him at top speed was enough to send shivers down his spine.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well aware of what the blades could do to him. With such power not far behind him, he knew that he would never be truly safe. 'The blades can easily catch up with me in a fraction of a second, ' he thought, beads of sweat running down his temples.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he gave up on thinking of a solution� he was somewhat unwilling to let the Divine Kingdom Continent and Central Region take the blades' damage. He wouldn't have the Sea God Continent take the hit too. If the blades managed to catch up to him, he would probably have to sacrifice the savage land after peeling off the mountain.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a brilliant thought came to his mind. "I have a token with the word 'mountain' on it. It should allow me to enter the fairy palace!"</p>

  <p>Just as he was readying himself to stage his plan, the golden wind blades stalled and began circling the air. In the next moment, they did a 180-degree turn and moved away from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Luo Zheng stopped mid-flight when he saw the blades moving in the opposite direction. With a smile, he muttered, "They really are intelligent, huh?" Luo Zheng sighed in relief as he observed the golden wind blades disappear into the distance� that was too close an encounter.</p>

  <p>As he began to analyze what had happened, he realized one thing� the golden wind blades didn't dare chase too far. Instead, they seemed to be protecting something. Pushing the curiosity to the back of his mind, Luo Zheng continued on his way. While he flew above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, his curiosity about the center of the storm grew exponentially, becoming all too tempting to satisfy. But ultimately, he did not want to risk his life on a whim. No matter what lay in the heart of the storm, it was impossible for it to exist in the great world. 'Even if I sacrifice this world, I would still barely make it into the center, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>'Forget it. I must focus on finding the two-colored wind blades.' With that, Luo Zheng continued on his way, even as the thought lingered on his mind.</p>

  <p>One double-colored wind blade could make a cut over ten feet deep.</p>

  <p>What about a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand of them?</p>

  <p>After fifteen days, Luo Zheng had already been blessed with over thirty thousand two-colored wind blades. At the time, the bottom of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain had already been completely cut off from the ground. Only a few pillars on its sides were keeping the mountain in place.</p>

  <p>But with Zheng's current strength, he still wouldn't be able to do anything to move the mountain.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff, puff�</p>

  <p>After several more two-colored wind blades collided with the mountain, the entire structure was finally stripped off completely.</p>

  <p>Releasing a deep breath, Luo Zheng looked toward the center of the storm and shook his head. Curiosity was what killed the cat� he knew he shouldn't be so reckless in his actions. It wasn't a place he could simply approach just as he was. With that, he turned around and shot toward the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>With the mountain ten thousand miles away from Luo Zheng, it would take him only several hours to reach it.</p>

  <p>Although he had observed the place many times through the will of the great world, it was the first time he was visiting the mountain in person.</p>

  <p>Only a sixth of the entire Magnetic Sacred Mountain was above sea level� its enormous entirety was hidden in the water.</p>

  <p>Whoosh�</p>

  <p>When he arrived, he flew over and stood at the mountain's peak.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" When he saw the mountain under his feet, Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he thought of the magnetic stone that Callan, the divine kingdom crown prince, had pulled out when they were on the Divine Emperor Secret Land. The stone was as tall as a person, and it seemed to fit perfectly on top of the mountain. But Luo Zheng had no clue as to how the stone broke.</p>

  <p>At the moment, the bottom of the mountain had already been peeled off.</p>

  <p>The next step was to lay down the divine textures and finally bring the mountain away.</p>

  <p>It was no easy feat. According to the Myriad Manifestations of Nature, it was necessary to put thirty-three six-star divine textures on the mountain to form a Sumeru Space. Only after it was fettered could it be refined.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Luo Zheng slowly took out the items he had prepared from his space ring and imprinted the first divine texture onto the mountain's surface.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaped into the air and crashed down the surging waves, circling the structure as the divine textures in his hands landed on the mountain one after another.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, everything went rather smoothly. But just as Luo Zheng was concentrating on imprinting the textures on the mountain, dozens of creatures charged right at him from the depths of the sea.</p>

  <p>The sound from the sea wasn't one easily heard� Luo Zheng only felt an abnormal movement of water behind him. When he looked down behind him, his brows furrowed. "Tenth-level beasts?"</p>

  <p>Such a creature was comparable to a Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain had existed for many, many years.</p>

  <p>Naturally, quite a number of creatures grew to rely on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain for survival. Seeing an invader in their territory, it was only natural that they attacked him.</p>

  <p>Among the tenth-level fierce beasts were ugly, strange fish, huge-bodied beasts, soft-bodied beasts, some kind of octopus riddled with sharp teeth, and some creatures of odd shapes that Luo Zheng couldn't even recognize.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death, fools!"</p>

  <p>Unafraid of the creatures, Luo Zheng merely looked down on them. In his eyes, even though they were comparable to the Life and Death Realm warriors, they were still no different from ordinary fish.</p>

  <p>But this time around, Luo Zheng planned to take the chance to train himself by taking on the fierce beasts. As the chaotic energy gushed from his belly, a long sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The sword intent activated by the chaotic energy began forming numerous gray cyclones, creating a string of tiny bubbles in the water.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, the first group of beasts were cut into countless pieces� the sharpness surpassed even Zheng's expectations. After changing the life vitality in his body, Zheng's strength had a qualitative change. But at the moment, he was facing mere tenth-level beasts. Although their strength was comparable to that of the Life and Death Realm warriors, their intelligence was far inferior.</p>

  <p>Still, the chaotic energy also had a weakness.</p>

  <p>The life vitality was created by nature� if a warrior's life vitality was used up, he would be able to continuously absorb the vitality of heaven and earth to replenish it. If one wanted to do it quicker, one could make use of the life vitality crystal.</p>

  <p>Normally, the chaotic energy could only be refined and created within the warrior's body. But according to the deduction of Zheng's master, everything in the world evolved from chaos. In turn, everything could be turned into chaos. Because Luo Zheng had yet to cultivate to such a state, he had to endure his weakness for the time being� it was still impossible for him to do anything.</p>

  <p>The sword attack had killed dozens of tenth-level and ninth-level beasts� the creatures came to realize that Luo Zheng was indeed, very powerful. At that moment, they all ran for their lives.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, Luo Zheng had no intention of chasing after them. In the first place, he had no clue why the ferocious beasts attacked him� perhaps they knew that he was going to move the Magnetic Sacred Mountain away. Still, Luo Zheng knew that he had destroyed the home they had inhabited for tens of thousands of years. If the creatures hadn't recklessly attacked him, he didn't have the heart to kill them.</p>

  <p>After chasing the beasts away, Luo Zheng swiftly laid out all the divine textures on the mountain. After finalizing the preparations, he began activating the textures one after another according to the method recorded in the Myriad Manifestations of Nature. Then, he returned to the very top of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain and activated the final divine texture.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng slammed his palm hard on the surface of the mountain as he shouted, "Rise up!"</p>
