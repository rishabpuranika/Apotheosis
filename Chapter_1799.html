<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were very few signs of life on the savage land. For countless years, nothing had changed.</p>

  <p>Lush vegetation covered the vast land. And countless vicious beasts and unknown creatures were hidden in the nooks and crannies of this wild land.</p>

  <p>Even the smallest ants present here were capable of inflicting danger.</p>

  <p>The areas through which the army ants marched were completely barren, and even the most ferocious beasts would steer clear of them. These fist-sized ants were capable of reducing an elephant into a skeleton in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>In the past, there had been powerhouses from the Divine Kingdom Continent entering the savage land, and almost all of them had perished.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Divine Kingdom Continent had given up on exploring this desolate land.</p>

  <p>All these years, only Tianming had stepped foot deep into the savage land.</p>

  <p>He had done this in the pursuit of taking away Chiyou's treasure.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the entire savage land began to tremble.</p>

  <p>A huge fissure extended from one end of the savage land to the other, forming a deep, bottomless gorge. Countless vicious beasts let out wails of grief.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The tremendous force which was like an invisible pair of scissors began to cut across the savage land. This savage land that was twice as large as the Divine Kingdom Continent was constantly collapsing.</p>

  <p>The monstrous seawater formed a ten-thousand-foot-high water wall, pouring into the huge fissure. It crazily washed over the exposed surface of the ground, and myriad of creatures started to create a helter-skelter, running all over the land.</p>

  <p>As the seawater poured towards the deep fissure in the land, a massive siphonic effect was formed. In the end, it flowed towards the opposite direction of the fissure, rushing towards the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the cities of the four divine kingdoms were all gathered around the Feather Holy Sea. There was no one around the continental margin, so the tsunami didn't cause too much of a disaster to the Divine Kingdom Continent. However, the fluctuations of the sea and that commotion that accompanied it aroused the vigilance of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The blow from the Torch Dragon had been dodged by Luo Zheng and had caused the savage land to crumble.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said, unable to explain anything to the others here.</p>

  <p>If that Torch Dragon's tail swept over him again, he had no idea how he would defend himself against it. 'Would I have to sacrifice the Central Region and the Divine Kingdom Continent?' This was a thought that ate him alive.</p>

  <p>In a heartbeat, Luo Zheng tore open a space crack and drilled out.</p>

  <p>The other Godly Geniuses also opened the space cracks and returned to the front of this world.</p>

  <p>Under the dim moonlight, the faces of those Godly Geniuses could be seen; full of dread. After all, just a moment ago, they had all thought that they were going to die.</p>

  <p>These Godly Geniuses looked at Luo Zheng again, but this time their expressions had softened.</p>

  <p>After all, he had valiantly blocked the attack from the Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>Even if they racked their brains, it would be hard for them to figure out how Luo Zheng had done it.</p>

  <p>There were countless secret treasures in the universe, all of which had their own uses. But even if it was one of the top ten treasures on the Universe Spirit Tablet, it would still be impossible to display such an effect.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Lucille asked.</p>

  <p>"If that Torch Dragon chases us, we'll be in big trouble," Lone said as he turned to look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter what, this place was already extremely dangerous for the eight of them. It wasn't advisable for them to stay there any longer. The wisest choice was to leave right at this moment.</p>

  <p>"You all... Alright, you can leave first. But I will not leave," Luo Zheng replied firmly. Once he was done, he activated the Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>Kurt and the others nodded. They realized it wasn't required for them to take any risk, seeing what was happening right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>Leaving at this moment was definitely the most sensible choice.</p>

  <p>However, the moment Luo Zheng activated the Teleportation Token, the tiny power of space failed to gather. The incandescent light turned into strange fragments that scattered in all directions like pieces of broken glass.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Tianming frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it isn't possible to gather all the power of space together," Luo Zheng remarked, looking utterly confused. He had never come across a similar problem before.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng finished speaking, his figure flashed as he attempted to use a spatial traveling. However, just as his figure disappeared, he seemed to crash into an invisible wall, causing him to stumble in the air.</p>

  <p>"Space imprisonment!" Lucille exclaimed as she witnessed the scene in front of her.</p>

  <p>Lawson's expression changed too. Looking up, he said, "Someone is imprisoning this space..."</p>

  <p>"Who could it be?" Nathan wondered with his eyes closed. By now, he had already wiped the golden blood from his face. Since he was already blind, he was even more anxious to leave this place. So after hearing about the space imprisonment, his anxieties naturally notched up.</p>

  <p>"Imprisoning the great world can only be managed by a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Perhaps someone has imprisoned this area, let's try somewhere else."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng genuinely wanted to figure out a way to send them out.</p>

  <p>The group continued downwards. After traveling for a long distance, Luo Zheng activated his Teleportation Token again. However, the result was the same as before. It was as if all the Space Law here had lost its effect.</p>

  <p>"It seems we will all end up dying here," Nathan exclaimed while his face revealed a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Tianming was a bit more open-minded. He smiled and asked Luo Zheng, "How did you block that attack from the Torch Dragon just a while ago?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flickered as he chuckled. "I am sorry, but I can't answer that question now," he added, continuing to smile.</p>

  <p>Actually, there was no need for Luo Zheng to hide this. Fusing with the will of the great world was Zheng's secret, and he had no reason for keeping it a secret. However, Tianming was someone who knew a lot yet kept things from Luo Zheng. He grinned because he was happy to finally retaliate.</p>

  <p>Listening to Zheng's evasive reply, Tianming sniffed and looked at the thick clouds in the sky. He did not push Luo Zheng anymore for an explanation, instead he only said, "It looks like something big is bound to happen in the great world, but I have a feeling that something is amiss. It seems that the sorcerer race has a trap set up here..."</p>

  <p>"A trap? Against us?" Lone asked.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and replied, "No, it might be a trap meant for the Supreme Lords."</p>

  <p>It was not hard to guess that, for the eight Godly Geniuses had met with danger, and the two Supreme Lords that were protecting them had fallen into a life-and-death battle. Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin and the others would definitely not be able to sit still and they would definitely arrive as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>At the speed with which the Supreme Lords performed, even if the Lower World was far from the Upper World, they would still be able to arrive in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>And once help arrived, they firmly believed that the Torch Dragon and the supreme sorcerer would end up dead.</p>

  <p>There weren't that many supreme sorcerers in the sorcerer race. It was very likely that there were no more than ten of them.</p>

  <p>At the current stage, it wouldn't be smart for the sorcerer race to fight foolishly with Supreme Lord of Original Sin and the others.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon did not leave and had chosen to fight with Supreme Lord Mirage. This in itself was an indication that the sorcerer race was not afraid of any back-up from the universe.</p>

  <p>"The sorcerer race is no match for us, and they don't fear the back-up,"</p>

  <p>Lucille said with her elegant brows furrowed. She continued, "Then, the only possibility is that this place is a trap."</p>

  <p>"Lucille has already figured it out," Tianming added and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of figuring it out?" Lawson's cold voice retorted. "We can't leave this damned place. I do have two Roaring Tokens, but even if we use them, we won't be able to transmit our voices out here…" he said, reeking with disappointment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng drifted down a distance before he turned around and said, "You're right. We can't leave here. Let's head back to the Cloud Hall now."</p>

  <p>On the way, Zheng's eyebrows twisted tightly.</p>

  <p>In order to save Ning Yudie, he had returned to the Lower World. This matter could not have been planned by the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>However, the sorcerer race cared a great deal about Ning Yudie and Preston returning to the Lower World which was why they chased after them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still confused about the turn of events.</p>

  <p>But just as Tianming speculated, he too believed this great world was indeed a trap. However, the sorcerer race did not plan to activate this trap right now. It wasn't meant for them hence it had to be a coincidence they had entered it.</p>

  <p>Something told Luo Zheng this trap had something to do with the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and the Star Storm.</p>

  <p>However, even Luo Zheng was unable to completely connect the dots. He couldn't find an appropriate answer to what the trap was.</p>

  <p>With his current strength, there was no way for him to interfere in a fight between powerhouses at the level of the Supreme Lords. Under the circumstance, the only thing Luo Zheng could do was return to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>On the way back to the Cloud Hall, Luo Zheng took out his token of mountain and tried to contact the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>This fairy palace was Zheng's last shelter. If he couldn't enter the fairy palace, then he was destined to be doomed.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng's expression turned even severer.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng could return to the fairy palace quickly by token of the mountain didn't mean that he had the fairy palace with him. From beginning to end, the fairy palace had always been located in that huge forest, and this token had only created a special pathway.</p>

  <p>In the end, he realized even the token of mountain used the Space Law which meant Luo Zheng couldn't return to the fairy palace either. 'I am actually doomed, ' he thought with a frustrated sigh.</p>
