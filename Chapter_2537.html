<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The old man's opening remarks finished signifying the start of the auction.</p>

  <p>The weapon refining in this world was not very advanced. The first treasure presented was a red flame saber, the second treasure was a black long sword, and the third...</p>

  <p>For every treasure shown, it would eventually cause a burst of surprise.</p>

  <p>However, they were of no interest to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The weapons were far from being as good as the weapons of the divine land. Though some weapons might have fused the chaotic energy, the weapon refining methods used to forge these weapons were too inferior to make them qualified to be called supreme chaotic weapons.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, such low-level weapons still attracted many people to compete for them.</p>

  <p>The auction was in an uproar selling about twenty weapons, until it reached the crucial time.</p>

  <p>The old man cleared his throat and announced, "The following items will be the finales of this auction. For the first item, we have received it not long ago!"</p>

  <p>All the people in the auction were holding their breath.</p>

  <p>The old man clapped his hands and two strong men walked out from the back hall carrying a stretcher.</p>

  <p>The stretcher was covered by a thick piece of cloth. Then from underneath, a wild and aggressive aura leaked out.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled as he saw the cloth. It was the blood wild bone he was going to auction.</p>

  <p>The two strong men put down the stretcher, and the old man gently held a part of the cloth as he suddenly lifted it off. He followed with another announcement, "The first most important treasure is a blood wild bone!"</p>

  <p>The moment the blood wild bone as tall as a person appeared in front of the crowd, they immediately let out a cry.</p>

  <p>"Such a huge piece of blood wild bone?"</p>

  <p>"Whose blood is in this wild bone?"</p>

  <p>"How could the owner find such a big piece now? That person must have taken a huge risk..."</p>

  <p>Everyone in the auction hall went into a frenzied uproar. The atmosphere fired up.</p>

  <p>The blood wild bones were much rarer than the ordinary wild bones, and a blood wild bone with such a huge size was most especially rare.</p>

  <p>The old man observed everyone's reaction in silence. He gently gave a pat on the blood wild bone then a stream of Wild God Power had been drawn out.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power swept through the air and then turned into a blood red wolf shadow.</p>

  <p>"Spirit Wolf God!"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering just now if this was the wild bone of the Spirit Wolf God..."</p>

  <p>"The Blood Wolf Clan is madly buying the wild bones. Who is so stupid to auction one here?"</p>

  <p>The truth was that by selling it directly to the Blood Wolf Clan could the seller get the best profit.</p>

  <p>Anyone who would buy the blood wild bone here would surely resell it to the Blood Wolf Clan.</p>

  <p>Zheng showed a helpless smile when he heard these statements.</p>

  <p>It was his first time to come to this place, so he was rather unfamiliar with transactions of related situations and he even had no chance coming in contact with the so-called Blood Wolf Clan.</p>

  <p>At this time, he was in an urgent need of wild bones for cultivation, which was the reason he must sell the blood wild bone as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"The starting bid is 12000 wild bones! Now please bid!" the old man flatly said as a start of the bidding.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not surprised as he had already known about the number of starting bid in advance.</p>

  <p>He was a little worried that this starting bid might be a little too high that no one would bid for such amount.</p>

  <p>His worry was rather baseless as he heard someone offer a bid right after the old man finished his words.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen thousand wild bones..."</p>

  <p>"Fourteen thousand..."</p>

  <p>"Fifteen thousand..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's heartbeat rose with excitement as the price kept increasing.</p>

  <p>It was already a huge number despite knowing that for the truly powerful Wild Gods, such amount of wild bones were nothing.</p>

  <p>The bidding amount continued to rise until the bidding price reached eighteen thousand wild bones.</p>

  <p>The reason why people bid for the blood wild bone was very simple. The Blood Wolf Clan would certainly offer a high price to buy it.</p>

  <p>The bidders could sell it to the Blood Wolf Clan through their own channels and would definitely make a fortune. Most of them were much well aware of how much they could earn from transacting with the Blood Wolf Clan wherein the price of eighteen thousand wild bones was already the limit. Offering a higher price than that couldn't provide them a profit.</p>

  <p>Zheng was rather satisfied with this result.</p>

  <p>Regarding as what would be auctioned next, he had little interest.</p>

  <p>Zheng was about to leave but heard the old man speak, "For the second treasure of finales, I think you will be more interested. It is a great opportunity for everyone!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, he suppressed the urge to leave and focused his gaze back to the old man.</p>

  <p>The old man slightly flipped his palm, and a light brown jade token appeared in his hand. He held the jade token and waved it in front of everyone. Then he said, "This is an Admission Token of Immemorial Wilderness."</p>

  <p>"Admission Token?" The second treasure of finales made him slightly lift up his eyebrow.</p>

  <p>He already knew that not all areas of the Immemorial Wilderness could be accessed freely during the times of his encounter with Zelda.</p>

  <p>The part of the Immemorial Wilderness where the Iron Tribe lived was a barren land. In the center of that area still lay plenty of wild bones, but the place was too dangerous and wasn't worthwhile for people to take huge risks to explore. As a result, he and those 'scavengers' could come and leave that place freely.</p>

  <p>In this world, there were plenty parts of Immemorial Wilderness with rich resources.</p>

  <p>The number of the wild bones in those parts was far beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>But only warriors sent by various great forces were qualified to enter the Immemorial Wilderness. If ordinary people sneaked in to collect the wild bones, they would surely end with death.</p>

  <p>The Admission Token was the token distributed by the large forces. Only with an Admission Token could one enter particular parts of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Having one could help people make a profit of total of hundreds of thousands of wild bones, or even more than one million wild bones There were rarely any Admission Tokens that circulated on the market.</p>

  <p>They were not something ordinary people could easily attain.</p>

  <p>It was a rare occasion that today, an Admission Token actually appeared in the auction house of Sand Core City. Everyone present gasped, holding their breaths.</p>

  <p>"Why is there an Admission Token for auction?"</p>

  <p>"If I have an Admission Token, I will dig the wild bones myself. Who would be willing to sell such thing out..."</p>

  <p>"It must be fake, right?"</p>

  <p>Doubt filled everyone's speculation. It seemed illogical for an Admission Token to appear here.</p>

  <p>The old man had already anticipated that the token would cause a debate.</p>

  <p>He smiled and said, "This Admission Token is genuine, and the starting bid of this Admission Token is only five thousand wild bones!"</p>

  <p>His next words once again gave everyone a start.</p>

  <p>If the Admission Token was indeed real, anyone who got it would surely make a good deal.</p>

  <p>"However, this Admission Token is the pass to enter the place beneath the Sky South Bone Tower." He continued to explain, "I'm sure some people know why the Admission Token is so cheap."</p>

  <p>"The Immemorial Wilderness beneath the Sky South Bone Tower..."</p>

  <p>"No wonder..."</p>

  <p>"The Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race have been fighting there for countless years. No one knew how many people have died in that Immemorial Wilderness. Of course this Admission Token doesn't worth much!"</p>

  <p>"Five thousand wild bones? Even if anyone gives me five thousand wild bones, I won't go there!"</p>

  <p>For those who knew the origin of the Admission Token, they naturally backed off.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who had been silently listening to their words, suddenly had a strange light that flashed in his eyes.</p>
