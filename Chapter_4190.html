<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every stage on the Other Shore exerted great pressure on those who entered. Most warriors would suffer serious discomfort when they reached a higher stage.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng felt the pressure quite vividly when he came to a new stage.</p>

  <p>But after being in the stage for a long time, he would get used to the pressure and no longer felt it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had imagined the pressure here would be unbearable, considering it was the core area of the highest stage of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But when he arrived, he was surprised to find he did not feel anything.</p>

  <p>What he saw before him was a vast, rolling grassland and a small lake in the distance. A breeze blew past and the water shimmered.</p>

  <p>This didn't seem like the Other Shore but more like an ordinary world.</p>

  <p>Soon though, Zheng discovered that something was not quite right.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Fuxi and the others beside him all became stiff, as if someone had cast a spell on them. The Monkey Spirit King and the Monkey Masters not far away were dead still too.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven?</p>

  <p>Master Fuxi?</p>

  <p>What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was flushed with astonishment and concern.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to freeze everyone, including the Monkey Masters and the Monkey Spirit King, by any sort of spatial means, no matter how powerful it was.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Just then, black cracks began splitting in the distance, extending towards Zheng from afar, crawling along like numerous reptiles and swallowing everything in their way. The lake and the grassland disappeared rapidly, in a seemingly impossible engulfment of the environment.</p>

  <p>"Be mindful, Zheng. This is the Space Devouring Technique!" The voice of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord rang out in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"The Space Devouring Technique has trapped them all?" asked Zheng disbelieving.</p>

  <p>"No, it's you who have been trapped," revealed the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. "What you see are all illusions, and the Space Devouring Technique will tear you and these illusions to pieces."</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The black cracks surged closer and closer and had soon spread to the human heroes.</p>

  <p>It was just as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had said; the Monkey Spirit King, the Monkey Masters and the human heroes were in fact not real. The ground beneath them was eroded to pieces by the black cracks and disappeared before Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The others might have been illusions, but Zheng himself was real.</p>

  <p>Seeing what was coming for him, he realized he had no way to escape.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>When the first black crack reached him, he felt an intensely powerful tearing force pulling at his body.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was much stronger now with the help of the ancestry-level bloodline. His body was as hard as rock in the face of the Space Devouring Technique, only the edge being slightly warped. The black crack then lost its power for moving on.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Then came more and more cracks.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of them surrounded and tore at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The Space Devouring Technique is not as terrifying as I imagined," Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>This revelation rendered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord speechless. The strengthening he had undergone was really quite extraordinary. "It's because your body is now too strong," he said.</p>

  <p>The attack lasted a full five minutes before the cracks faded away and the surrounding space gradually grew brighter. However, what Zheng saw before him had him astonished.</p>

  <p>Not far off, Zhurong had turned into a human shaped flame. It was then divided into hundreds of pieces. When a large portion of it was extinguished, another was ignited. But Zheng could feel that it was clearly weakened bit by bit.</p>

  <p>The body of the real Snake Goddess had also completely disappeared, turning into a shadow being sliced constantly.</p>

  <p>The real Fuxi, Gonggong, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others were all using their own methods to fight.</p>

  <p>"Were they also hit by the Space Devouring Technique?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord with a nod.</p>

  <p>The strength of the human heroes differed.</p>

  <p>After the Snake Goddess, Gonggong and Zhurong cultivated the Blood-controlling Method, they had activated their bloodlines and pushed them to the limit, turning them into entities of energy which allowed them to resist the black cracks. However, not all the bloodlines could turn into entities of energy.</p>

  <p>On the other side, the body of the real Emperor Charm flickered with a blue light. He danced in the air like a feather, dodging the cracks.</p>

  <p>But they were relentless and would not let him go. No matter how ingenious Emperor Charm's space theurgy was, eventually he was cornered and desperate.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Terrifying cracks crawled across his body and blood gushed out of them.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm!"</p>

  <p>Zheng took a step forward and was at Emperor Charm's side in a flash.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>An emerald green life energy emerged from Zheng's primitive land. This was the ability of the ancestry-level bloodline; regardless of the seriousness of the injury, it could be healed.</p>

  <p>But when the life energy gushed out, it had brushed past Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?" Zheng was aghast.</p>

  <p>"He is not here," answered the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, once the Space Devouring Technique had covered this area, everyone was isolated.</p>

  <p>"Then find him..."</p>

  <p>Even though the Space Devouring Technique was very powerful, it was a theurgy of the fourth-grade world. It was impossible for it to leave the space-time quadrant of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Before he could finish his words, Emperor Charm appeared to have reached his limit and hundreds of cracks began appearing across his body all at once.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>In the next instant, his body was torn to pieces, splashing blood in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm!"</p>

  <p>Zheng cried out in anguish.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>More blood mists exploded nearby and more human heroes died.</p>

  <p>The Space Devouring Technique had been activated unconsciously, quickly taking lives ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>"Alas..." the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sighed in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters on the other side were faring much better than the human heroes.</p>

  <p>As Treacherous Beings, they were capable of withstanding this onslaught.</p>

  <p>Although the Space Devouring Technique had cut them to pieces as well, they could be restored in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Monkey Spirit King stood motionless, his eyes focused dead ahead. No one knew what he was looking at.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, the awful scene of misery finally came to an end.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The shadow of Snake Goddess flickered, and the once blurry line slowly became clear, returning to her body.</p>

  <p>She had pushed her bloodline power to the limit to deal with the Space Devouring Technique. Her face was now deadly pale, and when she saw the blood stains on the ground, any color left in her face drained as well.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Beside the Snake Goddess, a black and white Eight Diagrams disk rotated slowly. Fuxi's figure soon emerged from it. He was calm as he faced the Space Devouring Technique, but noticing the miserable state of the human heroes caused his face to darken.</p>

  <p>Zhurong, Gonggong, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi then also recovered their forms.</p>

  <p>Da! Da!</p>

  <p>The emerald green fragments scattered all over the ground close by began moving. They continued shuffling and gathering together, forming into the Wing King, but much smaller in size.</p>

  <p>"Only a few survived..."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven stepped out from a snow-white light, his demeanor gloomy and heartbroken.</p>
