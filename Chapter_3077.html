  <p>The Soul-melting Light continued for more than two hours. Afterward, its rays gradually became dimmer until it finally dissipated.</p>

  <p>The whole Sacred Mallow Temple remained quiet. The atmosphere was rather ominous.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of here," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"But..." Fear still lurked in Dorothy's mind as she thought of those black eyeballs.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Those creatures aren't very powerful. They can only depend on the Soul-melting Light to kill people. Even if they were not dead, they still wouldn't be a match for me," Luo Zheng persuaded with confidence.</p>

  <p>If the Dreaded Eye Demons were truly powerful, Luo Zheng and Dorothy would not be able to resist them at all.</p>

  <p>With vigilant eyes, Luo Zheng walked out of the hollow first. Behind him was Dorothy who carefully stuck out her head to peep at the external environment.</p>

  <p>There were black stains on the walls. Luo Zheng looked at the trace of the black stains to see where the Dreaded Eye Demons came from. With a sharp glare, he investigated the tracks left behind.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the thirteenth floor, a light golden object was lying on the balcony.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked along the corridor to the balcony. With a curious expression, he examined the object and narrowed his eyes. "A spider?"</p>

  <p>A scared expression painted Dorothy's face as she also followed after him.</p>

  <p>When she saw the golden object, her face lit up with joy. "It's the Heavenly Spider! It finally made sense! That spider net on the first floor must be left behind by this spider!"</p>

  <p>Someone in the Taiyi Heaven Palace had the Heavenly Spider as his Other Shore Token. Dorothy had already seen his Heavenly Spider before. Thus, she immediately recognized it with a glance.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's the Heavenly Spider that attacked us just now," said Dorothy after she thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't make sense. The Heavenly Spider is already dead." Luo Zheng fiddled with it but it stayed motionless on the floor. "I don't think what happened just now is that simple."</p>

  <p>As he maintained his curious expression, Luo Zheng stretched out his hand and turned the Heavenly Spider over. Interestingly, he found a small hole between the spider's head and abdomen. Additionally, around the hole were black dots.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng reached for the tiny hole, the Heavenly Spider, which was originally like a dead thing, suddenly contracted. A surprised expression painted both Luo Zheng's and Dorothy's faces as the spider turned over and climbed up along the wall rapidly.</p>

  <p>Click! Click! Click! Click!</p>

  <p>What piqued Luo Zheng's interest was that the sound made by the Heavenly Spider while moving on the wall was exactly the same as to what they had heard before.</p>

  <p>Fear slowly crept deep inside Dorothy's heart. A sharp light flashed across Luo Zheng's eyes. He stretched out his finger and flicked. Suddenly, a small soul arrow shot out.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The small soul arrow traveled with fast speed. Immediately, it pinned the Heavenly Spider onto the wall.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Luo Zheng's palm gradually changed into a small knife. With it, he could cut the Heavenly Spider from the wall. Then, he cut the spider in half from its head to its abdomen.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>Suddenly, black balls the size of a bullet gushed out of the cut one after the other!</p>

  <p>"Ah! What the hell? Not this again!" As she looked at those small black balls, Dorothy's face turned pale. It seemed that she would always remember what she had encountered in the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>The small balls were immediately torn apart. From inside them burst out extremely small eyeballs.</p>

  <p>The little eyeballs could instill fear into those around them. However, they were much weaker than those Luo Zheng and Dorothy had encountered before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng resisted their attacks without any effort.</p>

  <p>"They are the descendants of those creatures. Look how little they are! They haven't grown up yet. There's no danger," said Luo Zheng as he pointed his finger at the little eyeballs. With a simple finger snap, an eyeball would explode and immediately turn into a pool of black liquid.</p>

  <p>A lot of small eyeballs had already escaped from the body of the Heavenly Spider. With great speed, they rushed in the direction of the wall.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the descendants of the Dreaded Eye Demons would still do harm to other warriors. As such Luo Zheng wouldn't let them go.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng had already killed a large number of them. His strength was tons above their dexterity so he was able to easily erase them.</p>

  <p>However, there were still some descendants of the Dreaded Eye Demons that moved along the wall. It seemed that they wanted to reach the back of the largest statue.</p>

  <p>"Why are they going there? What's behind that statue?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured as he followed the eyeballs and swept over the huge statue.</p>

  <p>He was slightly stunned when he saw the scene behind the statue.</p>

  <p>Behind the statue, three tiny pillars stood firmly. There were three balls on the top of the three pillars? two red glazed eyeballs, and a pure white ball.</p>

  <p>When he saw that the small black eyeballs were about to enter the glazed eyeballs, Luo Zheng rushed and killed them with a single move.</p>

  <p>"Hey! What's behind the statue?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy rushed over and took a quick look. When she saw the white ball, her body suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>"The soul force in this white ball is very powerful," Luo Zheng said with a serious face.</p>

  <p>"This should be the soul crystal. Wow! What a powerful soul crystal! It seems that there are countless people that died in the Sacred Mallow Temple. The Souls of Light that had been melted by the Soul-melting Light have been gathered in this ball," Dorothy said after she pondered for a while.</p>

  <p>"Does the soul crystal like this one have the same effect as the soul pill?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked as his curious eyes stared at the white ball.</p>

  <p>The aura he sensed from the white ball was very similar to that of the soul pill. With its massive power contained inside, it was like a huge soul pill.</p>

  <p>If the white ball had the same effect as the soul pill, Luo Zheng's opinion about it would greatly plummet. Soul pills were easily sold or purchased with divine crystals.</p>

  <p>"No. It's something else." Dorothy shook her head as excitement became apparent in her expression. "The soul pill can only restore the soul power and temporarily enhance the Soul of Light. However, a soul crystal can increase the upper limit of the Soul of Light. It can make our Souls of Light stronger!"</p>

  <p>After he heard Dorothy's remark, Luo Zheng's eyes sharpened.</p>

  <p>When his soul was still weak, there were still many methods to strengthen it. However, after his soul became the Soul of Light, it became more difficult to strengthen it. Apart from the enhancement of his Soul of Light on the Sea of Truth, Luo Zheng did not find any other methods to strengthen it.</p>

  <p>However, the soul crystal might be his hope. If he could absorb it, he might be able to greatly strengthen his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"Since soul crystal is so useful, aren't there any creatures that kill others' Souls of Light to refine soul crystals?" Luo Zheng asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>Some strong warriors were able to kill others' Souls of Light and refine them into soul crystals so that they could use them to strengthen their Souls of Light. For some ambitious people, it was a convenient way to improve the power of their Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>"Someone did it before. However, he lost his mind as a consequence,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy said with a shrug. "Except for the Soul-melting Light, it is extremely difficult to purify the Soul of Light with other methods. If you absorb the Souls of Light of others, you will also absorb their Memory Flames. If you absorb hundreds of people's memories, the result could only be chaotic."</p>

  <p>"Got it." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Although he already knew what the white ball was, he still had no idea what the two glazed eyeballs were.</p>

  <p>Even Dorothy, who was well-informed, didn't know what they were. Luo Zheng had no other choice but to ask No. 9527 in his mind.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 chuckled. "Ha! Did you realize that? You were very lucky to survive this time."</p>

  <p>"Huh? What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked as he knitted his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"This is not the Sacred Mallow Temple at all. Such a stupid name was only given by your human race. This temple originally belonged to the Dreaded Eye Demons. As such there are countless Dreaded Eye Demon statues in here," lectured No. 9527. "However, the temple has been destroyed long ago. Additionally, the Dreaded Eye Demons have already gone to extinction. Perhaps some of them managed to come back to life. They must have manipulated a Heavenly Spider that had broken in accidentally.</p>

  <p>Afterward, they probably killed so many Souls of Light with the Soul-melting Light in order to rapidly reproduce and cultivate their own descendants."</p>

  <p>The soul crystal was prepared by the Dreaded Eye Demons for their descendants. If Luo Zheng and Dorothy hadn't come, the race would have returned to life after a rather long rest.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Dreaded Eye Demons eventually died in the hands of Luo Zheng and Dorothy.</p>
