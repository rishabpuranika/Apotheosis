  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite Yolande's shock, she had absorbed the memories of her two clones who had known Zheng for quite some time. It was astonishing that Zheng had managed to obtain the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, but it didn't take her too long to accept this fact.</p>

  <p>That was also why she had been very calm when the manager of the weapons used the message rune to inform her. She believed that Zheng was able to obtain a good weapon.</p>

  <p>Still, Zheng had exceeded her expectations and had obtained an extraordinary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Timothy was even more shocked. He stood frozen at the entrance of the hall.</p>

  <p>He was prejudiced against those who ascended from the Lower World. In addition to that, he was incompatible with Yolande, so he naturally wasn't happy to see this happen.</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't bump into Zheng right then, he would surely hear about him obtaining the Thunder Wind Divine Sword sooner or later.</p>

  <p>The sword was so precious that even though he was the vice head, he was allowed to borrow it for a short time.</p>

  <p>But now, it belonged to Zheng, completely!</p>

  <p>He was just a fifth level Life and Death Realm junior, and he had been in the Mist Palace for less than a day and yet he managed to snap up the sword.</p>

  <p>It wasn't hard to imagine how much this frustrated Timothy. If Yolande wasn't there at the point, he might have played the bully and just snatched the sword from the boy's hand.</p>

  <p>But then again, he was the vice head of the palace. It would be too shameful if he really went so far as to snatch the sword from Zheng!</p>

  <p>He just glared at Zheng and the sword in his hand angrily. The sword that he had once desired was now detestable in his eyes. Finally, he turned around and entered the True Mysterious Hall.</p>

  <p>"Congrats to you," Yolande smiled at Zheng. She was quite happy to see Timothy looking dejected for the second time that day.</p>

  <p>Zheng merely nodded in reply. He was more worried about Xun.</p>

  <p>Yolande, of course, understood this looking at his expression. However, this was not the place or the time to discuss this matter, so she led Zheng into a hall.</p>

  <p>After they made sure that nobody else was around, Yolande took out the Soul Nurturing Wood and passed it to Zheng.</p>

  <p>He scanned the wood after taking it from her. He could feel that Xun's soul was now much stronger than before, in fact it was even stronger than his own. He was also surprised to see that the surface of her soul was emitting a faint layer of silver-colored radiance.</p>

  <p>"Her soul... It's at the Silver Fighting Soul Realm!" Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>When a soul was strong enough, it could reach the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>At this realm one's soul would be considered strong enough to assist one's physical body in battles.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul had already entered the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. Above that was the Silver Fighting Soul Realm, a much stronger and more difficult stage.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded and said, "That's what it was originally. However, only a remnant of her soul remained, and it was not enough to manifest its level. I have now helped her to regain 60% of her soul power."</p>

  <p>"But why hasn't she woken up yet?" Zheng asked nervously.</p>

  <p>Yolande's face revealed an innocent expression. She hesitated for a moment and said, "She is awake but... she's pretending to be asleep. It seems that she isn't willing to talk to me."</p>

  <p>The relationship between the Demon Night race and the human race was neutral— neither bad nor good.</p>

  <p>As the queen of the Demon Night race, Xun had a lot of pride and was aloof to other races.</p>

  <p>Although Xun and Yolande hadn't shown hostility towards each other when they met in the Tower of Sin, they weren't friends either.</p>

  <p>They just maintained a cordial relationship.</p>

  <p>Even if Xun had received a lot of help from Yolande, she still wasn't willing to be sincere towards her.</p>

  <p>Zheng instantly figured it out. He knew Xun's temper very well.</p>

  <p>Xun's body was destroyed, and only a remnant of her soul remained. Her life was on the line, but he had found her at that point and had been accompanying her in the past few years. He was perhaps the only person she could trust.</p>

  <p>In the next two hours, Yolande assigned Zheng a house to stay for the time being.</p>

  <p>The huge Mist Palace was divided into several areas. Since Zheng was a newcomer to the palace, he was made to stay with the other warriors of the Ice Cloud House.</p>

  <p>This was the core sacred place for cultivation in the alliance. So even an ordinary disciple's residence was decorated well like a small-scale palace. All sorts of facilities were available to them, save for the beautiful female servants.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until nightfall that Zheng finally had the time to examine the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>Before he had a chance to observe the conditions inside the Soul Nurturing Wood, he suddenly felt a strong soul power rushing towards his face.</p>

  <p>Poof!</p>

  <p>The charge of the soul was extremely violent. Zheng, whose soul was at the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm, was unable to endure such an impact and felt momentary dizziness.</p>

  <p>When he finally pulled himself together, he found that Xun's soul was standing in front of him, watching him quietly.</p>

  <p>Her soul looked vivacious, and her aura was sharper than before!</p>

  <p>"You... You're awake...!" he stammered in disbelief. Suddenly her soul rushed into his body.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng could sense that she had taken the initiative to fuse with his sword spirit again.</p>

  <p>But with her current strength, she no longer needed to exist as his sword spirit. Her soul was at the Silver Fighting Soul Realm, and the strength of her soul alone was enough to defeat enemies.</p>

  <p>Still, Zheng did not stop her from fusing with his sword spirit. He knew she had her reasons for doing so.</p>

  <p>After the fusion, Xun reappeared out of his body. She extended her slender arms and embraced him tightly.</p>

  <p>Zheng was taken aback. After a while, he murmured, "Why are you in such a hurry to fuse with my sword spirit?"</p>

  <p>"Because I want to feel you better..." Xun usually spoke in a cold and solemn tone, which made her seem distant. But right now, there was a hint of mischievousness in her voice.</p>

  <p>It all became clear to Zheng. Although the body of the sword spirit wasn't made of flesh and blood, its touch felt more real than the soul's.</p>

  <p>Xun eventually took two steps back and floated up in the air. Then, with a smile on her face, she said sincerely, "Thank you!"</p>

  <p>But Zheng shook his head and said, "I should be the one thanking you, Xun. Your soul was wounded because of me."</p>

  <p>Xun blinked and thought for a moment. She said wryly, "You don't have to be sorry about that."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Zheng asked, perplexed.</p>

  <p>"You are very important to me. Even if my soul is completely destroyed, I know you will avenge me sooner or later. But if you die, there will be no hope for me in this world." she replied flatly.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that she was right to a certain extent. As his sword spirit, she could extract her own soul and continue to live on even after he was dead. However, she would only be a wandering soul. Even if she could continue living in other people's bodies, it would be almost impossible for her to reclaim her position as the queen to take revenge.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, she was absolutely sure that the day for revenge would arrive soon if she helped Zheng.</p>

  <p>This was proof of her trust in Zheng. Nobody but Zheng inspired this much faith in her. So even though it was Yolande who had paid a hefty price to recover her soul, Xun was unwilling to thank her sincerely.</p>

  <p>Her trust in him was almost blind, but for some unknown reasons, she believed that she had done nothing wrong.</p>

  <p>She sized up Zheng with a hint of curiosity on her face, "You've only reached the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm but you've already ascended to the Upper World. You didn't ascend on your own. You had some help, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Free ascension through the ascending passage was an ancient and rigid rule. Xun had never heard of a warrior who could ascend on his or her own without reaching the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and answered earnestly, "Yes, I ascended on my own through the ascending passage."</p>

  <p>"But..." A baffled expression appeared on Xun's face.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled softly. Xun had been in a deep slumber for a long time.</p>

  <p>He began to tell her about his journey to the Divine Kingdom Continent, as well as everything that had happened after that...</p>

  <p>At the same time, about thirty thousand supreme worlds away from the Mist Palace, a pretty woman in a yellow robe stood quietly in front of a statue, her eyes full of hatred.</p>

  <p>This charming woman wasn't human. She had a perfect figure quite unlike an ordinary human girl, and the biggest difference was her long, pointed ears.</p>

  <p>She was another queen of the Demon Night race— the Queen of Punishment, who had two head-on conflicts with Zheng!</p>

  <p>There were three queens' statues in her palace just like the ones in the other residences of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>These days, she had been keeping an eye on the statue of Xun, the Queen of Killings.</p>

  <p>She knew that Xun had been on the verge of dying. There was only a faint light on the statue; it hadn't vanished completely. It seemed that Xun's soul would die anytime now— something she was looking forward to!</p>

  <p>But earlier today, the statue had suddenly started emitting a dazzling red light. The red light had a thick aura of slaughter, and it was quite disturbing to her eyes.</p>
