<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 218 The Power Of Luo Zheng's Fist (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Officer Yolande, I'm afraid you cannot refuse. This is a direct order from the leader, and everyone is obliged to undergo inspection. Even the commander is no exception to the rule. So please cooperate with us."</p>

  <p>Though the soldiers were scared, they must follow and execute the military order.</p>

  <p>But Yolande just looked at them without saying a word. She didn't intend to do the inspection at all and could care less of any military order. As she was about to close the door, Luo Luo Zheng stepped forward and said, "In front of you are loyal and responsible soldiers. As a key member of the White Emperor City's guards, you should set a good example to them by cooperating in the inspection. Why are you making things difficult for everyone?"</p>

  <p>The soldiers felt uneasy but still were grateful when Luo Luo Zheng stepped in and spoke with Yolande. This was something these soldiers wouldn't dare do.</p>

  <p>When Yolande heard Luo Luo Zheng, she suddenly turned around. The hemlines of her dress were slightly lifted by her sudden motion, revealing her slim legs. She stared at Luo Luo Zheng with her blank eyes and said, "It's none of your business, so I suggest you go away."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sneered and said, "I know that I might be overstepping, but it's the right thing to do. It would make everything easier for you and everybody else. Besides, it will only take a few seconds."</p>

  <p>But Yolande just kept on staring at him with her expressionless grey pupils. Suddenly, a transparent enchanted barrier appeared when Yolande flipped her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Damn, she got a hot temper!" Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows and quickly stepped back.</p>

  <p>He knew Yolande could be obstinate, but he didn't expect her to be so unreasonable. She was so easy to get irritated that anything would possibly result in violence.</p>

  <p>The soldiers knew that Luo Luo Zheng was only trying to help, but there was nothing they could do. They stood aside and prayed in hearts that Luo Luo Zheng would come out of this alive.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was moving at his top speed, which in Yolande's eyes was actually very slow. She could see his every move clearly and anticipate his next step.</p>

  <p>He was now surrounded by several transparent enchanted barriers coming from different directions and trying to capture him.</p>

  <p>As these enchanted barriers approached him and surrounded him, he lifted his left hand and a red light flashed from his arm. Using his fist, he smashed the transparent enchanted barriers in front of him with all the strength he could muster.</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Zheng's powerful innate energy was no match for any enchanted barrier and his punch had little effect on it. But at that moment, Luo Luo Zheng felt some strange red energy fired out of his left arm. It went through his left hand and finally hit the transparent enchanted barrier that was in front of him.</p>

  <p>After the red energy slammed forcefully into the enchanted barrier, a small red crack appeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was thrilled and punched on the red crack once again.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With the crackling sound, the small crack spread throughout the entire transparent enchanted barrier and instantly shattered it into pieces.</p>

  <p>The formerly invincible enchanted barrier was finally broken by Luo Zheng's fist!</p>

  <p>"Ahhhh!"</p>

  <p>The soldiers who were standing aside and watching the battle were shocked when the enchanted barrier shattered.</p>

  <p>From the ranking they came from, these soldiers were well aware of how strong Yolande was and that she was an Illuminating Soul Realm master.</p>

  <p>They knew that Yolande was the best in using enchanted barriers and only a few people, like the demon kings, could break her enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>The soldiers were initially worried that Luo Luo Zheng would just suffer great damage in fighting Yolande, given his half-step into the nature level. But the young man took them by surprise when he broke her enchanted barriers. Having the privilege to stay here, he must also be someone special.</p>

  <p>They didn't have a clue how he was able to muster such strength.</p>

  <p>Even Yolande was surprised. Her usual expressionless eyes glimmered in surprise.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it?" Yolande asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lifted his hand and smiled, "It's none of your business. Do you still want to lock me up? Nah, I don't think so."</p>

  <p>"From the looks of it, the red energy in your fist is an effect of the emerald crystal. But how did you obtain it?" It wasn't easy to pique Yolande's interest, but this one did. Though she kept a poker face, one could tell that she was curious to know.</p>

  <p>"I said it's none of your business. I suggest you move along with the inspection so these men can leave," Luo Luo Zheng said coldly. He stood there with his hands behind his back, waiting for Yolande to comply.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that so? Then let's see how long you can keep up with my enchanted barriers." She stretched out her slender fingers and snapped all of them at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Large numbers of transparent enchanted barriers appeared one by one.</p>

  <p>They started rushing towards Luo Luo Zheng at a crazy speed.</p>

  <p>"We'll find out!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also looking forward to a fight. He could use Yolande's short-temper to gauge the strength enhanced by the two magical crystals.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With the strength of the emerald crystal on his left arm, Luo Luo Zheng slammed the enchanted barriers one by one, leaving a red mark on them.</p>

  <p>He already knew that the red energy from the emerald crystal could weaken the stability of the transparent enchanted barriers. Even the tiniest taint could damage the transparent enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>After tainting the enchanted barriers with the red energy using his left fist, Luo Luo Zheng started throwing punches into the enchanted barriers using the power of the phoenix crystal to destroy them completely.</p>

  <p>Despite Yolande summoning enchanted barriers at a high speed, Luo Luo Zheng just smashed them easily.</p>

  <p>The pieces of the broken enchanted barriers shattered on the ground like rain.</p>

  <p>Every tinkle was the sound of Luo Luo Zheng breaking the enchanted barriers into pieces.</p>

  <p>Seeing that her enchanted barriers were of no use on Luo Luo Zheng, Yolande decided to change up her game. An intimidating Mu Ning started to emit from her body.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an enchanted barrier appeared, slowly encircling Luo Luo Zheng. This newly summoned enchanted barrier was different from the first ones.</p>

  <p>From the color of this enchanted barrier, Luo Luo Zheng realized that it was the Blood Prison Enchantment that Yolande used to deal with the demon king the other day.</p>
