<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng wiped the blood on the flying knife and gave Leopold a nod.</p>

  <p>Leopold, on the other hand, could only stare at Zheng with wide-eyed shock. "How in the world did you make it?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was at the same level of strength. Even if Zheng was an expert in martial arts, it would still take him a considerably long time to kill them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, those people were healthy, strong men. They might not be a match for Zheng but they could still give him a tough time or even escape.</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the others were also puzzled.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to kill a Wight with no intelligence.</p>

  <p>However, they had no chance in winning against four exiles on their own. Not even Timotheus was confident he could kill them.</p>

  <p>Zheng merely shrugged. "They were weaker than I expected."</p>

  <p>He wasn't in the mood to explain.</p>

  <p>The others were clearly unsatisfied with his simple reply but couldn't really say anything.</p>

  <p>Besides, the more powerful Zheng was, the more beneficial it would be for them in the end.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng picked up his sword and collected the crossbows Tyler and his companions left behind.</p>

  <p>The crossbows were normal weapons but proved themselves quite useful.</p>

  <p>As he tidied up the mess, the group of people who disposed of the Wights slowly caught up with them.</p>

  <p>Emily was at the helm. Her eyes immediately fell on Tyler's body and she raised her eyebrows in intrigue.</p>

  <p>The exiles that she, Timotheus and the others had killed were not that strong and came from small races. Tyler, however, was different. He was someone important in the Yellow Emperor race and was far stronger than ordinary exiles. Seeing him dead like this was shocking.</p>

  <p>"You're so efficient! Did Zheng rush in without getting hurt?" she asked, looking at Zheng and noticing that he was completely unharmed. She truly thought he had been a bit too impulsive and couldn't help but stare at him with concern.</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the others could only grin helplessly. "We did nothing. By the time we arrived, Zheng had already killed them."</p>

  <p>"What?!" Emily exclaimed yet her eyes visibly twinkled.</p>

  <p>The exiles of the Fire Melting race, the Star Deer race, and the other big races could only stare at Zheng with amazement.</p>

  <p>Zheng only smiled at Emily but refused to explain anything. He simply pointed at the corpses on the ground. "These people must have taken some type of special medicine that gives off fragrance. The Wights don't dare approach them because of it."</p>

  <p>The Wights had given them a lot of trouble ever since the Strength Equalizing Theurgy was activated.</p>

  <p>There was still the strong fragrance that emanated from the corpses and they could take advantage of it at this critical moment.</p>

  <p>It was then that Emily saw that look in Zheng's eyes as if he had a hidden trump card she didn't know about.</p>

  <p>However, whatever this trump card might be, Zheng had no intention of talking about it. Emily smiled to herself and decided to shift the topic to the corpses. "In that case, maybe we can use these corpses to avoid those Wights?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Zheng nodded affirmatively. "When our enemies hid behind the high platforms, we became like sitting ducks as they launched their attack. We can't move forward like this."</p>

  <p>Their enemies released a massive horde of Wights that charged at them earlier, leaving them no choice but to go on the defensive.</p>

  <p>Had Zheng not been there and rushed forward, many of their people might have ended up dead.</p>

  <p>It was not good to proceed with this threat over their heads.</p>

  <p>"Then what do you think we should do?" an old man from the Fire Melting race grunted.</p>

  <p>Emily had been leading them all this time so they naturally looked up to her as their leader. She was the strongest in terms of cultivation base and thus had the ability to make others follow.</p>

  <p>They were a bit uncomfortable with the fact that she seemed to listen to Zheng's advice.</p>

  <p>The young man no doubt proved himself when he killed the four exiles on his own but his low cultivation base made a few people somewhat wary.</p>

  <p>"We can divide ourselves into two," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Divide into two? How?" one of the exiles asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled. "I will make a group, comprised of myself, and you will be the other group."</p>

  <p>Some of them could only look at him in confusion.</p>

  <p>It was Emily who eventually understood what he meant, but she frowned at the suggestion. "Won't that be dangerous? You're gonna be all alone. I can go with you."</p>

  <p>Even after the activation of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, Emily and her group remained unafraid of Spark. They had strength in numbers after all. They were all now equal in strength.</p>

  <p>The problem though was that their enemies had the advantage of being in the dark and their group was too conspicuous in the light. If they went on like this, it was only going to be a matter of time before their enemies overwhelmed them.</p>

  <p>Zheng made this suggestion so as to hide himself as well.</p>

  <p>Emily was naturally worried about him.</p>

  <p>"That's right. It'll be too dangerous to go alone. Shall I, Ramzi, and Emily join you?" Timotheus suggested.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng shook his head. "You guys are too eye-catching. They'll immediately notice if you guys leave the group. I'll be the most secure on my own."</p>

  <p>Also, Zheng had the precedent to kill Tyler and the other three. Despite his idea being so dangerous, Timotheus and the others had no choice but to agree with his plan.</p>

  <p>Countless roads crisscrossed underneath the dense platforms.</p>

  <p>The group went on ahead while Zheng disappeared to go off on his own.</p>

  <p>He passed through the darkness on one side of the platforms, thousands of feet away from the group.</p>

  <p>Taking their past experiences into consideration, everyone maintained their silence and vigilance. They were always on guard against any arrow that might suddenly be shot out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>As Emily led the crowd through a ten-mile journey, a murmur suddenly came from behind a tall platform.</p>

  <p>"They are here, still led by Emily..."</p>

  <p>"Tyler and the three haven't returned yet. Did they fail?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he did and couldn't escape? So we must run if we can't defeat them."</p>

  <p>According to Spark's plan, different teams comprised of four people would attack Emily and her group with crossbows. Once they had launched their attack, they were to immediately run back and gather at the rear to prepare for the next round.</p>

  <p>If successful, this plan could effectively eliminate Emily and her team.</p>

  <p>However, Tyler and his companions didn't escape which made this team that hid behind the pillars feel restless.</p>

  <p>"Don't think too much about it. Release the Wights!" one of them ordered.</p>

  <p>With a crack, the fences between two high platforms suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Wights that had been trapped beforehand suddenly rushed forward like a tidal wave while the four men team set up their bows and arrows.</p>

  <p>Just as they took their aim, a flash of green light suddenly blinded them.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Where did this light come from?!" one of them murmured in confusion, turning his head to look for the source.</p>

  <p>He came face to face with Zheng who stood not that far away from them.</p>

  <p>His right hand glowed green from which he held a flying knife as thin as a cicada's wing. What was most unsettling was the way his eyes seemed to shine in the darkness.</p>
