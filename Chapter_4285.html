<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, you are united," the downgrader sneered.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King said beside him, "We can't redirect the path of the needle indefinitely."</p>

  <p>"I can constantly create the In and Out Holes, and Zheng can also do so. But how can that being from the Source World also do this?" the downgrader asked.</p>

  <p>Like Zheng, his energy did not originate from the primitive land. He had boundless energy and could create limitless In and Out Holes.</p>

  <p>But the Source World couldn't do this.</p>

  <p>This temporary balance would sooner or later be destroyed because of the energy drain from the Source World.</p>

  <p>The downgrader was in no rush. As time ticked by, the situation would more and more turn in his favor.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand, and the seventh set of In and Out Holes appeared. The needle flew towards the Source World.</p>

  <p>Without saying a word, the Evil God waved his hand and released the eighth set of holes.</p>

  <p>He didn't let Zheng be an onlooker. He directed the needle towards Zheng's primitive land.</p>

  <p>However, once he released the eighth set of holes, his expression became cautious.</p>

  <p>Although the Source World had expanded by more than a thousand times, and the energy contained within it was much powerful than it used to be, the energy required to create the holes was massive. The Evil God had released four sets of holes in rapid succession, which had consumed most of the Source World's energy. If he continued to release more holes, the Source World would probably not survive this.</p>

  <p>But now that things had picked up momentum, there was no way out of this for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the first one who couldn't hold on would lose.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng created the ninth set of holes.</p>

  <p>The downgrader released the tenth set.</p>

  <p>The Evil God unleashed the eleventh set.</p>

  <p>The twelfth set.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth set.</p>

  <p>The needle drilled in and out of the black and white holes. It had already zigzagged to and fro thirteen times, and it was now heading towards the Source World.</p>

  <p>"The Hyperspace Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God tried to release the fourteenth set of holes.</p>

  <p>He absorbed the remaining energy of the Source World and began to transform it into the holes, but the process was abruptly cut off halfway.</p>

  <p>The energy of the Source World had been utterly spent!</p>

  <p>The Evil God raised his eyebrows, his eyes revealing rare traces of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven observed the change in the Evil God. He knew clearly how much the drain on the Extreme Form energy was. The Evil God probably wouldn't be able to hold on for long.</p>

  <p>The needle was still careening ahead at an extreme velocity. Almost half a minute later, it would hit the Source World.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the corners of the Evil God's mouth suddenly curved up, forming a leering smile.</p>

  <p>'When did I become so indecisive?' he thought.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had been so cold that he could sacrifice everything to reach his goal: his future, family, strength, status, and even his own life. All he craved was to defeat Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that he took control of the Source World, he unwittingly became softhearted. He began to care about Edna and Shera, who had tried her best to please him, and also the numerous living beings in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Once people began to care, they developed weaknesses.</p>

  <p>The Evil God realized that in caring, he would suffer a complete failure.</p>

  <p>"The Source World is so vast and boundless. It should have much more than just a little energy," the Evil God muttered darkly.</p>

  <p>His will was transmitted through the Source World, and soon it arrived in a province belonging to the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>Humans dwelt there.</p>

  <p>When the will of the Evil God was felt, everyone in the province raised their heads.</p>

  <p>The citizens, the True Gods, and even the warriors at the Other Shore Realm were all terrified when they felt this indomitable will. They didn't know what fate awaited them.</p>

  <p>"The Source World is in grave danger. You must offer yourselves to save it." The booming voice of the Evil God rang in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, everyone was immediately overcome by an ominous feeling.</p>

  <p>They were being told to sacrifice themselves!</p>

  <p>For what?</p>

  <p>Why did they have to sacrifice themselves to save the vast majority?</p>

  <p>Needless to say, they were most reluctant.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God didn't offer them any alternatives.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Some plants, soil, sand, and stones quickly rose up into the air, turning into fine powder and finally disintegrating.</p>

  <p>Then the rocks, houses, animals, and people who were still resisting were all sucked into the air by an irresistible force where they also disintegrated and dissipated.</p>

  <p>In the end, the many layers of the ground, the caves, the bed rocks underneath, and even the creatures hiding underground were also sucked into the air and disintegrated.</p>

  <p>They were not destroyed. Instead, they were all transformed into energy.</p>

  <p>Before long, the Evil God had transformed everything in the province into energy, leaving behind only a layer of crushed shell that was three or four miles thick. If this thin layer of shell was converted into energy, an opening would be created in the Source World, and this would let Zheng and the downgrader notice the weakness of the Source World.</p>

  <p>More and more provinces suffered the same fate.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of billions of creatures from hundreds of races in more than thirty huge provinces were all deprived of their lives, and their bodies were consumed after they heard the words of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Everything happened in less than ten seconds.</p>

  <p>The energy gained from these living materials successfully created the fourteenth set of holes for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>A Holy Soul Realm master was engrossed with his cultivating in the black hall of the Evil God. He was one of the masters invited by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>He possessed dozens of life tokens of his clansmen. The moment the province he had called home was destroyed, all these life tokens were shattered.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" the warrior screamed in agony and took out a large bronze mirror. In the mirror, he saw the empty province. Every living thing in the province had disappeared. "Oh, my God! What happened to the province? It is gone? Why is everything gone?"</p>

  <p>He was not the only one to be shocked. A member of another race also discovered that the Life Lamps of his clansmen had been extinguished.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't detect what was going on with his clansmen, he reasoned they must have suffered the same fate.</p>

  <p>"Shh!"</p>

  <p>The real Evil God suddenly appeared next to the warrior, held his neck with one hand, and made a gesture of silence towards the crowd with the other. "They have all been sacrificed for the Source World. You should be beholden to me. If I didn't do that, you would have perished too."</p>

  <p>"I..." The warrior clenched his fists, exposing blue veins.</p>

  <p>However, when the Evil God clamped his neck so gently, all of his strength vanished, and there was no possibility of him resisting. Every muscle and bone in his body turned into powder, and then into energy.</p>

  <p>"You not only need to know devotion, but also your place." The Evil God grinned at the crowd and then walked towards the third floor.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God had decisively sacrificed dozens of provinces at the last moment, the speed at which he created the holes was slower than normal, which allowed Zheng and the downgrader to discover some clues.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God released the holes when the needle was only five hundred miles away from the Source World. The energy of the Source World may not be enough," the Snake Goddess keenly observed.</p>

  <p>"That's to be expected. When limited energy faces off against infinite energy, it's not hard to imagine the end," Kincaid said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Evil God, and the downgrader all possessed Extreme Form energy, so they seemed to be standing shoulder to shoulder at the starting line, but the Evil God and the Source World would surely be the first to fall behind.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't say anything and focused on releasing the fifteenth set of holes.</p>

  <p>The sixteenth set.</p>

  <p>The seventeenth set.</p>

  <p>The eighteenth set.</p>

  <p>These huge holes overlapped in a most complicated way.</p>

  <p>Although the needle resolutely moved forward, it was difficult to distinguish its intended goal.</p>

  <p>By the time the Evil God had released the twentieth set of holes, he had sacrificed over a hundred provinces!</p>
