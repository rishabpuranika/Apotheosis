<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors on Willow Island wasted no time in comprehending the sword intent in the clouds.</p>

  <p>The sword practitioners were able to comprehend the sword intent faster than the others owing to their natural advantage.</p>

  <p>However, the saber and spear practitioners were not simply going to let this opportunity pass. Intents were similar and they could still seize this chance to comprehend each strike in the clouds.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood still and stared at the sky, lost in his thoughts for a moment.</p>

  <p>He smiled after he realized something.</p>

  <p>'So that's why I found it so hard to control my sword intent after I tempered it.</p>

  <p>This sword move?is a last resort move! Its aim is to kill in one shot.</p>

  <p>One must lay everything on the line in that one thrust, even his own life!</p>

  <p>Such an extreme sword intent could only be matched by such an extreme move.'</p>

  <p>The realization hit him like a ton of bricks.</p>

  <p>The first step to comprehending a sword intent or practicing a cultivation method was learning how to control it. Only by turning the sword intent or cultivation method into one's own power, one could release the power to achieve his goals. Warriors had to practice martial arts step by step in order to grasp and control the higher levels of the cultivation method they practiced. The more a warrior was able to exercise control, the more power he would be able to use and release.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Sword skipped this step altogether. He had abandoned all reasoning and simply performed this sword intent without any reason for control.</p>

  <p>"The only way to compete with a True God is if one abandons all reason and simply throws it all in. Is that the reason why Supreme Lord Sword is said to be on par with the True God?" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but mutter to himself.</p>

  <p>His conclusion would've greatly pleased Supreme Lord Sword had he been standing beside him. A young man who had just managed to break through to the Soul Sea Realm was able to perfectly sum up things based only on the sword move Supreme Lord Sword performed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's baptism by Supreme Lord Sword's sword intent meant that his comprehension speed was much faster than anyone else.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Willow Island stood at a complete standstill.</p>

  <p>The warriors below the thick clouds were determined to utilize every second in comprehending the sword intent carried by the clouds.</p>

  <p>Two hours?</p>

  <p>Twenty hours?</p>

  <p>Two days?</p>

  <p>It wasn't until three days later that the sword clouds gradually faded away and revealed the purple sky. This magnificent sight was the result of the blue heavens reflecting off the waters of the Orange Sea World.</p>

  <p>A few warriors remained where they stood, staring blankly at the purple sky as if trying to comprehend more sword intent.</p>

  <p>Those who were diligent in their comprehension learned a lot!</p>

  <p>"It's a pity I don't specialize in swordsmanship! Studying just one stream of that sword intent made me feel as if I already learned a lot! You sword practitioners got really lucky this time!" someone remarked.</p>

  <p>A sword practitioner heard his words and couldn't help but agree wholeheartedly, "Ten percent?." he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I was only able to comprehend ten percent of this Gods-intimidating Strike but it's still enough to improve my swordsmanship by leaps and bounds!" he exclaimed as his hands shook from the power of his sword.</p>

  <p>One's comprehension depended on their intelligence and their own level of understanding of sword intent. The deeper the understanding, the more the warrior would be able to comprehend.</p>

  <p>The leaders were also smiling. Their strengths were far more powerful than the common warriors in the thirteen palaces. They too had gained much insight because of the sudden arrival of the sword clouds.</p>

  <p>"But, who exactly made these sword clouds appear? Why were the words on the stone wall completely destroyed?" a palace leader asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>The words left behind by Supreme Lord Sword had been there for countless years. Numerous warriors had stayed by the stone's side trying to comprehend the mysteries within this relic but none was ever successful. Why did they choose to reveal themselves in the sword clouds during this particular Passing the Torch?</p>

  <p>Yolande's gaze fell on Luo Luo Zheng. She remembered how he said something about some white sword shadows just before he started the test. Did the arrival of these sword clouds have something to do with him?</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Yolande, the gaze of the old man in cotton clothes also fell upon Luo Luo Zheng, "Luo Luo Zheng! Before the Passing the Torch started, were you meditating here all this time?"</p>

  <p>They had almost forgotten about this seemingly trivial fact. After Passing the Torch started, while others were perceiving the laws on the stone carvings after passing the Purification Pool, Luo Luo Zheng had been still absent and hadn't arrived until a few hours later.</p>

  <p>Layla suddenly remembered about this after hearing what the old man said...?</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared on Luo Zheng's face as everyone regarded him with scrutiny. Even if he absorbed the white sword shadows, the appearance of the sword clouds had nothing to do with him!</p>

  <p>In the midst of everyone's confusion, they were unaware of the two Spirit Supreme Realm warriors who had both risen. It wasn't until the two ragged-looking warriors released their powerful auras that everyone turned to notice them. And they saw the two warriors were holding swords in their hands.</p>

  <p>Though these two warriors were at the Spirit Supreme Realm, their talents were ordinary and could never be compared to those from the thirteen palaces. Their swords were also mediocre, which were two secondary third-rank swords. The weapons of most of the warriors from the thirteen palaces were better than those. They were not special at all and were mere old men who had wasted their days meditating.</p>

  <p>The two had been here for tens of thousands of years and their weapons had long since been worn down. Landry's long sword, in particular, was already covered with cracks and tears.</p>

  <p>A swordsman cherished his sword, however, even the most cared-for divine weapon rusted in time.</p>

  <p>Landry never wavered in polishing his sword every once in a while but he couldn't keep time at bay. The cracks eventually formed on the blade and made it look weak and a bit rusty.</p>

  <p>However, it was this cracked old sword that drew everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>They could feel the powerful Mu Ning that was emitted from the sword!</p>

  <p>With a battle cry, Landry raised it up high and thrust it towards the huge stone!</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>The warriors had just spent the past three days carefully comprehending and this move was very familiar to them. Quite a number cried out after seeing Landry perform this move.</p>

  <p>"This old man?. has at least comprehended thirty percent of the Gods-intimidating Strike!" a palace leader shouted.</p>

  <p>These leaders had all managed to comprehend a lot more with their cultivation and talent, but they had only comprehended around ten or twenty percent in the end.</p>

  <p>However, Landry, this Spirit Supreme Realm warrior was able to comprehend thirty!</p>

  <p>Those leaders looked sullen. How could such an old Spirit Supreme Realm warrior comprehend so much more than those mighty talented leaders? It didn't make any sense!</p>

  <p>None of them considered the fact that this old man had spent sixty thousand years just sitting by the stone and trying to comprehend the intent hidden within the words left behind by Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>His intensive studying had paid off and Landry, along with Damian, had gotten so much more insight than even the Sunset World lord!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh-" a sharp, shrill sound emanated from the tip of Landry's sword.</p>

  <p>This strike contained mere thirty-percent of Supreme Lord Sword's power but the results were frightening. To put into perspective: a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior's power could never hope to compare to this mere thirty-percent strike.</p>

  <p>The cracked sword pierced through the huge stone, and left it crumbling under its power! This rock had been bigger than a mountain but it immediately cracked and crumbled into pieces as it collapsed.</p>

  <p>The sight overwhelmed Landry whose eyes began to tear up.</p>

  <p>He had already given up all hope of ever achieving anything in his life after staying in this place for thousands of years.</p>

  <p>Like all the other warriors who had chosen to stay here, despite knowing that it was a dead end, all he could do was meditate and hope that an event such as this would come one day.</p>

  <p>A vast majority of warriors had already given up or were driven away due to the Orange Sea World's exploration. Only Landry and Damian stubbornly remained and even ended up shelling a huge amount just to stay there.</p>

  <p>They had been hopeless, waiting for their Five Aging Processes to come and their lifespans to end. However, the day was yet to come.</p>
