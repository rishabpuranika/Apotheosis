<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2678 Thunder Materialization </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>There was a difference in terms of strength between the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>In their clans, Rachelle and Shahn were considered as the top figures among the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>With his current cultivation base, Zheng wasn't threatened at all.</p>

  <p>Just as he had arrived at the divine land, he was immediately chased down by the powerful clans. That was too coincidental.</p>

  <p>After thinking about it carefully, he came up with a rough idea.</p>

  <p>Since Emily's space channel was built on top of the divine land and had penetrated through a universe, a particular Holy Being must have been alerted.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know who exactly was alerted, but he assumed that it was a Holy Being that belonged to the union of the powerful clans since Rachelle and Shahn had been sent.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what kind of power he was about to face. If Holy Beings and Demi-holy beings got involved, then he would be in big trouble.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he chose to retreat first.</p>

  <p>Now that the other party had used the Ruling Slate to seal off thirteen regions, he had to quickly move to an unsealed region. As long as the token of mountain was activated, he could escape and return to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"You want to leave?"</p>

  <p>Rachelle stomped the ground in tiptoe, immediately transforming into a ray of blood-red light that quickly flew over.</p>

  <p>Shahn followed closely, a bright silver sword appearing in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle's two swords that chased after Zheng suddenly collided against each other.</p>

  <p>A deathly aura flowed out of those two blood swords, while a beam of cross-shaped blood radiance charged towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Each consummate True God had mastered a certain Godly Way. The power in Rachelle's cross-shaped blood radiance was controlled, but its malevolence was undeniable.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was running right in front of them, didn't even look back.</p>

  <p>"The Thunderstorm Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>The Godly Tile in his inner world flashed, and a beam of thunder burst out from it.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The thunder struck down his elixir field and pierced through his back.</p>

  <p>In just a short time, the thumb-sized thunder condensed and formed a pair of huge thunder wings that were about a thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>The two wings that were flapping on Zheng's back enwrapped Rachelle's blood radiance.</p>

  <p>Flashes of powerful thunder discharged from the wings and hit and crushed the blood radiance instantly.</p>

  <p>Then the wings flapped once again.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng turned into a bolt of lightning and sped away.</p>

  <p>"This is�" Rachelle was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"It's the consummate level theurgy of the Thunderstorm Godly Way --</p>

  <p>Thunder Materialization!" Even Shahn himself was stunned. "Did he reach the consummation of the True God Realm with the help of the Thunderstorm Godly Way Tablet which is under the watch of my clan?</p>

  <p>Damn it! This can't be!"</p>

  <p>Shahn, who was never known to use such words, couldn't help himself.</p>

  <p>They had at least accepted the fact that Zheng reached the consummation of True God Realm in ten years.</p>

  <p>That was not threatening though. If the other consummate True Gods of the union of the powerful clans came in time, they could easily put an end to Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Shahn and Rachelle arrived in the Square Sky Region, they saw that Zheng was right beside the Thunderstorm Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>According to their elders, Zheng had been there for a short while. How could he have used the tablet to step into the consummation level?</p>

  <p>It was unacceptable.</p>

  <p>"No. According to the information I have, he mainly cultivates the Emotion Closing Godly Way," Rachelle said with a long face. "He could only reach the consummation of True God Realm with the Emotion Closing Godly Way."</p>

  <p>"But he just presented the Thunder Materialization!" Shahn exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten how strange he is? He can even use my clan's Blood Breaking Bite and your clan's Parting Water Divine Mirror," Rachelle said, shaking her head in frustration.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that as he is a consummate True God now, he can use all the other consummate level theurgies?" Shahn asked rather loudly.</p>

  <p>After he said that, they glanced at each other with shock in both their eyes.</p>

  <p>It was a harsh realization.</p>

  <p>At that moment, they didn't know how to solve their problem.</p>

  <p>"Let's just keep on following him and inform others to surround him. We can't let him slip this time. He must die!" Rachelle said through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>With that, she left, rage glinting in her eyes.</p>

  <p>With a helpless expression on his face, Shahn had no other choice but to follow suit. He thought to himself, 'We never intend to let him go. On the other hand, he has let us go before.'</p>

  <p>Back when Joy had taken Zheng to escape from the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Zheng released all the consummate True Gods who were imprisoned in the jade seal.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Three beams of light flew over at a very high speed, occasionally passing by a divine city.</p>

  <p>It was stated on the slates that flying was prohibited. Since they had violated such a rule, the slates attacked them.</p>

  <p>However, even before the slates were activated, the three of them had already flown past the divine cities without a trace, leaving many True Gods in the cities in awe.</p>

  <p>Day and night, from dusk until dawn.</p>

  <p>The view before Zheng was endless mountains that looked as if they were waves in the sea.</p>

  <p>From a distance, a clear boundary had appeared.</p>

  <p>'Almost there. I hope the other side of the Square Sky Region hasn't been sealed yet, ' Zheng thought as he flapped his thunder wings.</p>

  <p>The space channel was built by Emily, so Zheng didn't know where the thirteen paths would lead to.</p>

  <p>If the thirteen regions were connected, then it was trouble for Zheng. That just meant that he had to go through several regions in order to escape.</p>

  <p>When Rachelle and Shahn saw the direction that Zheng had taken, they were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>The west and the north of the Square Sky Region were adjacent to the Sea Vessel Region and the Snake Spirit Region respectively.</p>

  <p>The area connecting the Sea Vessel Region and the Square Sky Region was very large. According to the direction that Zheng had fled to, he would enter the Sea Vessel Region.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the space in the Sea Vessel Region had also been sealed off, which meant that Zheng was unable to escape. Moreover, Walton was there. Barring accidents, he had been waiting with his people there.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Zheng had finally crossed the border of the Square Sky Region.</p>

  <p>The intersection of the two regions was very distinct. The Square Sky Region was covered with mountains, and at the end of it was the Sea Vessel Region which was surrounded by a vast sea.</p>

  <p>The Sea Vessel Region looked like a carrier for holding water, and most of its areas were covered by water. That was why it was named that way.</p>

  <p>When he entered that region, an idea came to his mind. He actually wanted to travel through space.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A flash of lightning from the sky charged towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face turned dark. He was on full alert. By flapping his wings, he dodged the lightning.</p>

  <p>However, he could only watch the lightening destroy the space channel that he built.</p>

  <p>The space of the Sea Vessel Region had also been sealed.</p>

  <p>It meant that he could not escape by using the Grand Teleportation technique or return to the fairy place with the help of the token of mountain.</p>
