<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The sea water rolled out from the deep of the Sea Vessel Region and endlessly slapped the mountains around the edge of the Square Sky Region.</p>

  <p>Wrapped in the huge pair of thunder wings, Zheng stood in the air.</p>

  <p>Rachelle kept a certain distance from Zheng and looked down at him.</p>

  <p>"Several great regions around the Square Sky Region are sealed off.</p>

  <p>Even if you have wings today, it is still difficult to fly away!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>That was the last thing he wanted. Crossing a large region would take him a lot of time.</p>

  <p>The longer he stayed there, the worse the situation could get for him.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng knew Rachelle was right, he could only smile coldly at her. "You stress that the surrounding regions are sealed off because you want me to stay here. To me, it doesn't seem that difficult to find the real exit."</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng finished his words, the thunder wings on his back suddenly spread.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The blue thunder radiance effused from those wings.</p>

  <p>Rachelle and Shahn saw that Zheng had turned into a beam of thick lightning and flew away.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't just randomly choosing a direction.</p>

  <p>He flew along the dividing line between the Square Sky Region and the Sea Vessel Region.</p>

  <p>That way, he could find the third large region through the shortest route.</p>

  <p>If he still couldn't employ the spatial transference in the third region, then he could only figure out other ways.</p>

  <p>That was his best choice at present.</p>

  <p>When both Rachelle and Shahn noticed the direction Zheng had escaped to, they looked equally displeased.</p>

  <p>If he followed the dividing line, it wasn't long before he could enter the Snake Spirit Region.</p>

  <p>In that case, they were just letting Zheng slip their hands again.</p>

  <p>Not long after Zheng had escaped, a huge water curtain suddenly appeared in the sea just right below him.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>The water curtain instantly exploded into thousands of water drops that covered Zheng.</p>

  <p>His eyebrows raised as he saw the situation. His pair of thunder wings flapped again. Just as he passed through the water drops, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>All of the water drops suddenly changed course.</p>

  <p>They all intertwined, forming a large net of water and once again enveloping Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is this� the Parting Water Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Facing the huge water net, Zheng twisted his body and his thunder wings began to whisk.</p>

  <p>Such a move immediately broke the net into pieces, crystal drops of water splashing everywhere.</p>

  <p>Shortly after the water drops scattered, they condensed again and turned into a new, larger net that instantly covered Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>At the same time, layers upon layers of water curtains began to appear in the sea. Those water curtains turned into more water drops, turning into larger nets that were continuously attaching themselves to Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>There was a strange energy in those nets. When that energy hit Zheng, his body suddenly became dull.</p>

  <p>"Ha! We got him! He will never escape my Magic Water Net!"</p>

  <p>A figure slowly rose from the water and floated towards the top of the sea with a huge smile on his face.</p>

  <p>At that same time, a huge mountain on the edge of the Square Sky Region cracked.</p>

  <p>The center of the mountain kept on caving in. After the solid rocks broke, they all gathered together, forming layers of steps.</p>

  <p>Walton carefully walked up the steps with his shield sword in one hand.</p>

  <p>He stared at the huge water net suspended in the air, then raised his head and laughed, "Rachelle, Shahn... How useless you've been! Compared to my junior fellow disciple, you are far inferior!"</p>

  <p>The man in blue who stood on top of the waves was called Diego Tang.</p>

  <p>He was Walton's junior fellow disciple and also happened to be one of the consummate True Gods in the Tang Clan.</p>

  <p>Being a consummate True God, it went without saying that Diego Tang was immensely powerful. However, he was weaker compared to Shahn, Walton and Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Both Rachelle and Shahn had chased Zheng for quite a long time, but they never succeeded. As for Diego Tang, he caught Zheng so easily.</p>

  <p>He was a pride of the Tang Clan.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for letting me have this chance! It's finally the Tang Clan's turn to take this guy away!" Diego Tang cupped his hands in front of Rachelle and Shahn, and then said, "Bryan, take action now!"</p>

  <p>This time, there were three consummate True Gods sent by the Tang Clan to carry out the task. They were none other than Walton Tang, Diego Tang, and Bryan Tang.</p>

  <p>Both Diego and Bryan Tang became consummate True Gods by means of the Parting Water Godly Way and were hiding at the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>Worried that Rachelle and Shahn might get the chance to take Zheng before they could, Diego had asked Bryan to make a move as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>After Diego Tang spoke, a huge whirlpool suddenly appeared in the sea below.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the sea area within a hundred miles suddenly went wild, all of the water rushing towards the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Then, an astonishing amount of power came out of the center of the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>The insane suction power of the whirlpool allowed the seawater around to descend into it pretty quickly.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Bryan popped out of the sea with a long blue bow in his hand.</p>

  <p>As if it was made of water, the bow was also crystal clear. The long arrow that was pristinely placed on it was definitely made of water.</p>

  <p>Ordinary water arrows couldn't hurt people.</p>

  <p>But what Bryan Tang held in his hand was the Parting Water Bow, and it had the ability to make use of all the water in the surroundings.</p>

  <p>His Parting Water Bow had absorbed all the seawater within a hundred miles, dropping the sea level by one hundred feet.</p>

  <p>The highly condensed Parting Water Arrow also turned into a lethal weapon.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Bryan Tang's fingers released the bowstring, allowing the arrow to leave.</p>

  <p>The Parting Water Arrow that was extremely condensed at that time flew straight towards Zheng at a high speed.</p>

  <p>Three consummate True Gods from the Tang Clan had meddled into that battle. Even Rachelle didn't expect such a thing to happen.</p>

  <p>Seeing the powerful arrow shooting in Zheng's direction, she slightly narrowed her eyes. A bad feeling emerged in her heart as her expression also began to change. "Be careful! That guy isn't weak!"</p>

  <p>In fact, both Rachelle and Shahn didn't intend on taking credit for the Tang Clan's hard work.</p>

  <p>The two of them had followed Zheng all the way without attacking him because they weren't so sure if they could actually beat him.</p>

  <p>They planned to take action after meeting the other consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>However, they never expected that Walton would recklessly lurk out there along with two other consummate True Gods and just attack Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The Parting Water Arrow had broken through the water nets and was already heading straight for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze turned cold as he remained stuck in the water nets.</p>

  <p>With no intention of avoiding the attack, Zheng had a small black snake appearing on the palm of his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The Parting Water Arrow hit Zheng and actually pierced through his body.</p>

  <p>"The arrow hit him?"</p>

  <p>"He's either going to die or turn into a cripple this time!"</p>

  <p>Bryan and Diego Tang beamed with excitement.</p>

  <p>They thought it wouldn't be an easy mission as most of the warriors from powerful clans on the Floating Islands had been sent out to make a move.</p>

  <p>It was beyond their expectation that they would succeed during their first attack.</p>

  <p>However, their excitement only lasted for six seconds.</p>

  <p>They noticed that Zheng's figure had ominously flashed and the wound pierced by the Parting Water Arrow had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Within just nine seconds, Zheng had used the jade seal to erase the wound.</p>

  <p>The arrow that Bryan Tang had released destroyed the water nets which freed Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng flapped the thunder wings on his back, and then he turned into a thick thunderbolt that struck down from the sky.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Bearing Sword in Zheng's hand pressed against Bryan Tang's abdomen. He looked at Zheng with unexpressive eyes and couldn't help but tremble.</p>

  <p>At that moment, an indescribable feeling arose in Bryan Tang's mind.</p>

  <p>He felt that the person in front of him was not a living being or object, but a presence of nothingness.</p>

  <p>While Bryan was dazed by that feeling, Zheng raised and swung his Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>Immediately, he cut Bryan Tang's cinnabar field and internal organs into pieces with the sword. At last, the soul that hid in Bryan's mind was also chopped into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>As the Shadow Bearing Sword cut through Bryan Tang, a sword radiance of several thousand feet long came out from his back which caused a huge wave. Then, it flew towards Diego Tang who stood from a distance.</p>
