<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also curious as to why he was chosen when there were so many warriors.</p>

  <p>He didn't know that he wasn't the only one with this doubt. The armored men, other warriors, and the two hall leaders were also quite curious.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be a big deal even if Luo Luo Zheng was talented and able enough to adapt to the Vitality Pressure in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>The supreme world was vast and there were many, many talented people in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. How could he, of all people, go to Holy City just with his talent? They wouldn't believe it, no matter what.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng no longer resisted them, the two hall leaders finally set their minds at ease. They didn't know that it was a matter of great importance to take Luo Luo Zheng to Holy City. They only knew that someone who asked them to do that couldn't be taken lightly. So they acquiesced, not daring to offend Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One usually had to find the armored men and go through some transfer formalities when leaving the mine. But the present situation, being an anomaly, excused the need for all formalities.</p>

  <p>The armored man in the lead even stepped forward at the right time and said seriously, "Luo Luo Zheng has left the mine on an exceptional basis. He shouldn't have paid the life vitality jades in the first place, so I will return them to him."</p>

  <p>What kind of logic was this? The speaker was quite quick-witted. He wanted to curry favor with Luo Luo Zheng in front of the two hall leaders.</p>

  <p>The 100 life vitality jades was not a small amount for Luo Luo Zheng at his current stage, which was why he gladly accepted them.</p>

  <p>The life vitality jade was nothing to the two hall leaders. They knew that the armored man was trying to curry favor with Luo Luo Zheng. With a faint smile, they took Luo Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng left, the mine immediately went through a major reorganization. The warrior called Riyad was the first to bear the brunt of this crisis. He seemed to have fallen to great misfortune; all of the life vitality jades that he had accumulated over the years had been taken away and he had had to pay another 100 life vitality jades in order to leave the mine.</p>

  <p>The other warriors were green with envy when they learned that Luo Luo Zheng had been taken away just like that. But they couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Master He had been conversing with Luo Luo Zheng in an extremely cordial tone.</p>

  <p>The two hall leaders were curious about Luo Luo Zheng and wanted to know who had ordered them to take Luo Luo Zheng to Holy City. They wanted to find out who the big shot behind Luo Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng himself was at a loss. How could he answer the two hall leaders? He didn't know any big shot in this vast Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed the two hall leaders into the space channel, traveling for what felt like ages. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't gauge how far he had traveled. After flying for five days and five nights, they finally arrived at another enormous space channel, through which they flew for another three days before they emerged.</p>

  <p>Once the light from the space tunnel had dissipated, Luo Luo Zheng found that he was standing on a transmission platform that was tens of thousands of feet tall. As he lifted his head to scan the area, he saw a vast and boundless city in front of him. He could not see the margins of the city at a glance. Buildings as tall as mountains dotted the landscape around him.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew what kind of material these buildings were made of, but their bodies were all flickering with a light blue luster. As a result, when he looked at them, he felt that the city was carved with crystals and found it extremely beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Is this Holy City of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place?" Luo Luo Zheng could not help but sigh.</p>

  <p>As far as Luo Zheng's understanding of the universe went, the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was not a particularly powerful force.</p>

  <p>He had previously learned that the human race controlled over ten thousand supreme worlds. The world he was presently in was only one of that vast number. Moreover, the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was not the strongest among the sacred places in the supreme world. It was only ranked third.</p>

  <p>But to his surprise, Holy City of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was vast. He marveled to himself at the vastness of the supreme world and how it far exceeded his imagination.</p>

  <p>The two hall leaders threw proud glances at each other at Luo Zheng's exclamation. Luo Luo Zheng, a warrior from the Lower World, had never seen the real world. Master He said, "Just Holy City alone has a vast variety of living beings."</p>

  <p>A vast variety of living beings? Luo Luo Zheng couldn't believe his ears. "How big is Holy City?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Master He chuckled and replied, "If we use a vivid analogy, it is around a tenth of a plane of the Lower World."</p>

  <p>At this, Luo Luo Zheng was stunned yet again.</p>

  <p>It was amazing to him that a city alone could cover a tenth of the great world.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then understood why it took ten days for them to reach Holy City through the transmission channel.</p>

  <p>Cities like Oracle City and Cloudy City could already be considered large cities in the Central Region. The capitals of the Divine Kingdom Continent were as large as Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Oracle City had a size that was at most a thousandth of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, in the Lower World where Luo Luo Zheng was from, seas covered seventy to eighty percent of the area. The Central Region occupied only about three percent of the great world's area.</p>

  <p>The size of this city before him was three times that of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Most mortals who lived in such a large city would probably never be able to leave it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had guessed the truth.</p>

  <p>Not everyone in the Upper World was a warrior. Most of them were ordinary human beings who were unable to cultivate, or who did not aspire to cultivate. They could not leave this city no matter how hard they tried. After all, the city was too huge, and even the warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had to fly for several days before they could leave the city.</p>

  <p>"Alright, let's continue on our way," Master He said, satisfied at the shock on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng left the transmission platform, he found thin, straight lines in the air. These thin lines intertwined with each other, but their heights varied. Right at this moment, many warriors were flying along these thin lines at incredible speeds.</p>

  <p>As he saw Luo Luo Zheng looking at these lines, Master He said, "There are too many warriors in Holy City. If we fly too fast, we are bound to collide with each other, which is why we have used divine textures to set up tens of thousands of lines that lead to all the places in the city. The red lines are entrances, and blue lines are exits. These lines differ in height from each other to prevent us from colliding."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng now felt enlightened about the purpose of the thin lines.</p>

  <p>Illuminating Soul Realm warriors could fly in the air and although there were a lot of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors in the Lower World, the sky wasn't too crowded.</p>

  <p>There were a number of warriors at and above the Illuminating Soul Realm in Holy City. They had to have a plan in order to prevent accidents when they flew.</p>

  <p>These thin lines were the same as roads in a city.</p>

  <p>The two hall leaders brought Luo Luo Zheng to one of the lines and continued onward.</p>

  <p>Just like what Master He had said, all warriors on their line were flying in the same direction. Their speeds were different but they flew in an orderly manner.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for these thin lines, the sky above Holy City would have been packed to the brim, and the warriors would have been unable to fly even if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just been on the thin line for a short while when a rowdy group of warriors charged forward.</p>

  <p>They didn't have the slightest intention of abiding by the rules. They were all shouting and chasing each other at a speed that was way higher than it should have been.</p>

  <p>They seemed to be in their early twenties but their cultivation bases were not low. Most of them had reached the Soul Sea Realm. Only a few were at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>As they spotted the rowdy group, the warriors who were flying in the same direction as Luo Luo Zheng ducked out of line.</p>

  <p>Young as they were, they hailed from aristocratic families and were powerful enough that no one dared to offend them.</p>

  <p>The two hall leaders frowned as they saw this.</p>

  <p>They enjoyed a high status as hall leaders. But they didn't want to stir up trouble in Holy City. After all, this place had a countless number of people with many different abilities. The leaders of the thirty-six halls were powerful figures in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, but there were also many elders and other high-ranking people above them. So they had to avoid trouble whenever possible.</p>

  <p>Noticing that the two hall leaders had retreated, Luo Luo Zheng also stepped aside.</p>

  <p>He hadn't thought that two of the youths would change direction and actually rush towards him.</p>
