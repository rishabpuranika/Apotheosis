<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1836 Growth </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors were famous for being bold and generous. Chapman's heart ached, but he couldn't utter a word.</p>

  <p>All he could do was watch as Luo Luo Zheng emptied his wineskin. After holding it in for a long while, he finally said with a smile, "Good? good alcohol capacity?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other Collapsing Mountain warriors had expressions that made it clear how they wanted to swallow Luo Luo Zheng whole.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng's pupils were completely red. He could feel countless spikes crazily circulating within his body, stimulating every nerve.</p>

  <p>Under such stimulation, his body underwent a miraculous transformation.</p>

  <p>In truth, after one entered the Collapsing Mountain race, the pressure from the gravitational force was already a form of cultivation.</p>

  <p>So when a martial artist first refined their body, they would choose to cultivate under the waterfall. When the water washed over them, they'd feel pressure on their body and resist it, strengthening themselves.</p>

  <p>In other words, after one entered the Collapsing Mountain race, the cultivation had already begun.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors ate precious birds and strange beasts.</p>

  <p>Although they weren't converted into pills, they weren't to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The Sinful Dragon's heart was originally very rare. Even ordinary Collapsing Mountain warriors weren't fortunate enough to get a taste.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had eaten it, he gained a great benefit.</p>

  <p>After the meat and wine were finished, Luo Zheng's gaze turned calm.</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was no fool. How couldn't he see that ordinary people would never get such treatment?</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warrior must have needed him for something.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, why would he be treated to meat and wine?</p>

  <p>According to Luo Zheng's judgment, the problem lay in his physical body? it might have even been related to his somehow fire-resistant figure.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they wouldn't have thrown him into the bonfire.</p>

  <p>It was true that Chapman felt sorry for his strong wine, but since Luo Luo Zheng had already drunk it, there wasn't anything to do. In fact, seeing how the kid wanted to get straight to the point, he rather admired him.</p>

  <p>"I want you to get something for me," Chapman said rather bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Let me guess," Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly. "That something is hidden within some kind of strange fire? a fire so powerful that none of you can reach within it, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is so." Chapman didn't bother denying.</p>

  <p>"But I am not strong enough."</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng was telling the truth. The person before him was able to face a Supreme Lord. Although Luo Luo Zheng didn't fear any fire, he didn't think what the warrior was entrusting to him was as simple as grabbing something from within the flames. Luo Luo Zheng was only at the Spirit Supreme Realm, after all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's response made Chapman chuckle. "Our Collapsing Mountain race is where the strength source is located. With your talent, there shouldn't be a problem."</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors didn't resist outsiders, but it wasn't exactly easy for an ordinary foreign martial artist to earn their care. Most of the warriors there relied solely on their own strength to fight for a piece of cake amongst the Collapsing Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>If they were to spend their all nurturing Luo Luo Zheng, they would raise his level quickly. It was in their favor that Luo Zheng's potential was already strong, to begin with.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng looked calm, he was bubbling with excitement.</p>

  <p>Such an opportunity could only be found by accident, not sought. When he saw the chance, he couldn't let go.</p>

  <p>"In that case, I will do all I can to help the Collapsing Mountain race,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Deal!"</p>

  <p>With Chapman's personality, he wouldn't have forced Luo Luo Zheng to do anything. The Collapsing Mountain warriors never cared about coercing others, nor would they casually receive favors from someone else.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was willing to help them, they would do anything in their power to return the favor.</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice fell, Chapman grabbed at the air and pulled out a huge piece of meat from the bonfire. With a diameter of ten feet, the chunk was thrown right at Luo Luo Zheng. It pressed him into the ground, causing a burst of laughter.</p>

  <p>That night, Luo Luo Zheng began devouring the various kinds of meat in a kind of frenzy.</p>

  <p>Each piece of flesh contained a certain kind of power. These strange beasts were at least comparable to world lords, some even Supreme Lords. But the Collapsing Mountain warriors had defeated them all.</p>

  <p>Devouring the meat of these strange beasts was actually wasteful, in a way. There were quite a few top tier ingredients in the food, kinds that would drive pill refiners crazy. If the meat was made into pills, the effect would multiply.</p>

  <p>And the warriors knew about this. But there were abundant beasts in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and the warriors could hunt them every day. They cared not for such waste. Their ancestors had used this method of training for generations, after all. It was a part of their tradition and a part of what created such a valiant race.</p>

  <p>That night, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea how much food he consumed. After dinner, he was carried back by two Collapsing Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu and the rest of the warriors on the ground stared at Luo Luo Zheng with envy.</p>

  <p>His strength was clearly lacking? he couldn't even stand up? but he could enjoy such treatment. One could only imagine the loss the rest felt in their hearts, having lain on the ground for several years.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Luo Zheng had barely been in the Collapsing Mountain race for ten days.</p>

  <p>What they weren't aware of was that it hadn't even been a month since Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>As she looked at Luo Luo Zheng in dissatisfaction, Han Liusu pouted her thin lips.</p>

  <p>She didn't really care about the food of the Collapsing Mountain race, and the strength source wasn't quite enough to move her heart, but the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance was effective enough on her. She felt hungry, and while Luo Luo Zheng had stuffed himself with food, she ate nothing.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng was leaning against the wall. At this moment, his body was still burning with pain. When he met Liusu's displeased gaze, he gave her a faint smile and flicked his finger lightly, rolling a piece of meat towards her side.</p>

  <p>"I haven't forgotten about you," Luo Luo Zheng said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>As he ate and drank, he discreetly hid some food in his space ring.</p>

  <p>Such action was against the rules of the Collapsing Mountain race, but they probably wouldn't pursue the matter.</p>

  <p>When the warriors around them saw the food, their eyes blazed with fire.</p>

  <p>If only they could move, they would've crawled up and taken the small piece for themselves. But if they could move freely, they would probably forget about the food momentarily.</p>

  <p>"How am I supposed to eat?" Han Liusu stared at Luo Luo Zheng pitifully. It was too difficult for her to even move her head and she wasn't willing to end up like him. Burying her head in her food was too unsightly for her.</p>

  <p>In the end, the heavy responsibility still fell on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was too difficult for him to stand up and walk, but he could push himself a little, at the very least.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked helpless as Han Liusu stared at him. He could only crawl over slowly and tear the meat into pieces, feeding them to her bit by bit.</p>

  <p>After consuming the meat, Luo Luo Zheng could feel every part of his body be activated.</p>

  <p>Along with the Collapsing Mountain warriors' songs, the primitive power was like a tide, constantly surging within his body.</p>

  <p>Instead of forcing himself to stand up, he gradually adapted to the gravitational force.</p>

  <p>The next evening, Luo Luo Zheng was once again respectfully invited to the square to continue wolfing down his food.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors didn't have any particularly special cultivation methods. Every day, they would eat large chunks of meat, drink loads of wine, and then use the songs' baptism to unknowingly increase their strength.</p>

  <p>Some people could encounter a situation in which their strength increased, but their bodies couldn't bear the power.</p>

  <p>But the toughness of Luo Zheng's body was no longer what it used to be.</p>

  <p>After half a month had passed, Luo Luo Zheng could feel his strength rise continuously. Now, he could move slowly along the ground.</p>

  <p>Still, this wasn't exactly something to be proud of. The children of the Collapsing Mountain race could run all over the place. Even though he was a Godly Genius, he could only take feeble steps like a dying old man. If he didn't take the utmost care when he walked, he would lose his balance and fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>But at this growth rate, it wouldn't be long before Luo Luo Zheng could move freely.</p>

  <p>Just that day, there were a few more people arriving at the Collapsing Mountain race. All of them were world lords. Luo Luo Zheng had even met their leader before. He was none other than Kennan He, Liusu's follower.</p>

  <p>They were chased by the Formless Sky Python that day. Thanks to Kenna He, who held the python's one head to stop it, they managed to run away. But they had no clue whether or not the two world lords were still alive.</p>

  <p>When these world lords entered the Collapsing Mountain race, they didn't seem like normal fighters who couldn't get up from the ground.</p>

  <p>After all, their cultivation and strength were by no means ordinary and they were strong enough to resist the gravitational force. Still, they couldn't walk freely as they wanted.</p>

  <p>"Princess Royal!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Han Liusu was safe and sound, Kennan He finally felt at ease.</p>

  <p>During this time, he had searched almost every inch of the surrounding area, afraid that Han Liusu would be swallowed up by the Formless Sky Python. He was excited the moment he saw her. Never did he expect her to actually enter the Collapsing Mountain race's territory to seek refuge.</p>

  <p>While Kennan He looked agitated, Han Liusu wore an indifferent expression. She had been hoping that he would find the place quickly and take her away as soon as possible. But now, she had no desire to go.</p>
