<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 503 Invulnerable Body (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Unexpectedly, Luo Luo Zheng made a move that had the audience shouting in fear,"Ah crap, don't jump there!" A member of the Luo Clan shrieked,"Bryson sneaked an escape-proof net on that little platform from the start! How clever of him. Maybe all his previous attacks were well-thought of and calculated only to lead Luo Luo Zheng to his trap!"</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan members could only imagine the worst that could happen in this clash. It seemed as if the tables had been turned and Bryson took over the upper hand of the battle. Some of them even closed their eyes because they knew they wouldn't be able to bear the unholy image of dripping blood from 12 swords piercing through Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Even the seniors of the Luo Clan who, just a few moments ago, were speechless in amazement, were at a loss for words for what they were seeing right now. Disappointedly, they sighed,"We never thought Luo Luo Zheng could fall into Bryson's trap so easily."</p>

  <p>At this point of the battle, Melvin and Tristan nervously had their fists clenched tightly, praying for a miracle to come even if Luo Zheng's chances of winning seemed so slim.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, standing at the back of the crowd, Yan could not help but shake her head and heave with a sigh, 'With Luo Zheng's almost indestructible body, those swords would not hurt him even if they deeply pierce into his flesh.</p>

  <p>I wonder what kind of expression will be on Bryson's face once he realizes Luo Luo Zheng will beat him to death." Yan smirked.</p>

  <p>Bryson was feeling so thrilled that he could feel the surge of adrenaline, rushing though his veins. He wanted to give Luo Luo Zheng a more tragic death, and so he wielded more life vitality to increase the fury of his swords by 50 percent! With this overwhelming power, not only could the swords pierce through Luo Zheng's flesh, but they could stab all the way through his body and leave 24 holes of free-flowing blood.</p>

  <p>Once the flying swords lunged at Luo Luo Zheng, the excitement in Bryson's face faded in an instant. Suddenly, his expression grew bemused, bewildered at what he just saw before his eyes.</p>

  <p>'How come... How come Luo Luo Zheng didn't get penetrated by my flying swords?</p>

  <p>It seems like the swords just bounced off the moment they touched Luo Zheng's flesh, doesn't it?</p>

  <p>But how can it be possible?</p>

  <p>There is a slim possibility that Luo Zheng's protective life vitality has warded them off. But I saw it clearly that what those flying swords targeted was Luo Zheng's corporeal body.</p>

  <p>Could a man's corporeal body be that invulnerable?</p>

  <p>No way!</p>

  <p>Those flying swords are propelled by the Blood Evil Force!</p>

  <p>Although the Blood Evil Force is a tier 3 cultivation method, this cultivation method pursues the way of killing, allowing me to get twofold progress with half the effort. Its power is way more formidable than those at the same tier. It's almost as powerful as a tier 4 cultivation method!'</p>

  <p>The members of the Luo Clan were dumbfounded. They couldn't believe what they just saw.</p>

  <p>In fact, they felt relieved that Luo Luo Zheng suddenly regained the upper hand? his performance was just beyond their imagination. They were in shock, but deep down inside they were all cheering Luo Luo Zheng on.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of those members of the Luo Clan, Bryson was a tyrant with supreme power. His power and strength were so overwhelming, that he could effortlessly end the life of anyone in the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Because of this, no one dared disobey him.</p>

  <p>If they did, only one thing awaited them? death.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>When Bryson launched this full-power strike, Luo Luo Zheng fought it off simply with his indestructible body.</p>

  <p>The 12 flying swords just ricochetted off of Luo Zheng's body, not even leaving a single cut nor a simple scratch.</p>

  <p>"This has to be the invulnerable body mentioned in the legends," mumbled one of the members of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Even when Bridger, who was dim-sighted from old age, saw this miraculous scene, two lines of tears rolled down from his eyes. He then exclaimed with his old, husky voice,"Indeed, justice always prevails.</p>

  <p>Now, Mike can truly rest in peace knowing he now has a worthy successor."</p>

  <p>Glaring at the flabbergasted Bryson, Luo Luo Zheng demanded coldly,"You tell me, how should I dodge you? Actually, I never even considered running away from you. Though you and I are both at the third rank of the nature level, the gap between you and me is beyond your imagination!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hopped from the small platform once again and dashed over towards Bryson.</p>

  <p>Still, Bryson was not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Since his strongest strike did not turn out the way he pictured it to be, he could tell that Luo Zheng's strength had now grown out of his league.</p>

  <p>Bryson's body grew cold out of fear. With the overwhelming fright that was surging through him right now, only one thing popped up in his head? escape.</p>

  <p>But how could Bryson outrun the indestructible Luo Luo Zheng? When Luo Luo Zheng picked up his speed, he caught up to Bryson within barely a second.</p>

  <p>During this desperate moment, Bryson had no choice but to yell. "Help me!"</p>

  <p>But at this point, Luo Luo Zheng already landed behind Bryson. He muttered icily,"Even if a king were here, he couldn't get you out of this now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smacked his fist into Bryson's back. The impact of his punch sent Bryson crashing through a house nearby.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a chilling voice sounded not too far,"Who dares to hurt my disciple? I'll eat you up alive!"</p>
