<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yolande was somebody he could trust.</p>

  <p>She thought that Luo Zheng had innumerable Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng would not be able to explain to her how he got the Roaring Token because it concerned the fairy palace, his master, and many other things that he would rather not discuss with her.</p>

  <p>So Luo Zheng chose not to explain and keep mum about the whole matter.</p>

  <p>Yolande also knew that Luo Zheng wouldn't tell her the truth. Since he refused to explain it, she couldn't force him to reveal his secret. At least he didn't deny being in possession of these tokens.</p>

  <p>Instead, she asked, "Do you know the identity of that mysterious woman who was singing that day?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head absently.</p>

  <p>Like him, the mysterious singer also seemed to have countless Roaring Tokens. It was very likely that her token could be used countless times, just like the one in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>But he didn't know who that stranger was.</p>

  <p>"All right!" She nodded believing him but continued sizing him up.</p>

  <p>The current Yolande was in her complete body. So from that perspective, this was the first time she had met Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One of her clones had taken the decision to allow Luo Zheng to ascend freely, and the Celestial Position had come to the same conclusion. She was very pleased with the fact that the Celestial Position did not force Luo Zheng to join them. But coincidentally, he had still ascended to the alliance. It was obviously his fate.</p>

  <p>There was no certain path for a man without destiny, but no matter what Zheng's future path was, she didn't mind helping him.</p>

  <p>Aiding him was worth her while, especially since his Roaring Token could be used countless times. The token was very useful for many races, and perhaps she would need Zheng's help several times in the future. Since she didn't have many Roaring Tokens, he could help her spread the news.</p>

  <p>As Yolande regarded Luo Zheng with these thoughts racing through her mind, he felt like she was seeing right through him. She made him feel naked and bare, like he no longer had any secrets from her.</p>

  <p>He knew that even though Yolande's cultivation level was incredibly high, she didn't have the expertise. The only reason he was feeling uncomfortable was that the gap between his and her cultivation levels was too great.</p>

  <p>This was exactly how he had felt when the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was sizing him up.</p>

  <p>Zheng's cultivation level was too low. In the Lower World, he was already a top-level warrior but in the Upper World, the Life and Death Realm was just the beginning for him.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, he hadn't gotten any news from his sister. Perhaps it was just as Xun had said back then� all the great worlds were extremely afraid of the young warrior who had appeared in the Ethereal Spirit Sect. He surpassed the heaven, and Yan was somewhere beyond the heaven.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't want to believe this conclusion, but the possibility was high. If he wanted to find Yan, his current strength was far from enough.</p>

  <p>He thought about Xun and asked, "Yolande, do you know any way to awaken Xun?"</p>

  <p>"Xun?"</p>

  <p>Yolande was stunned by his question. Her clones had too many memories. They had met too many people and seen too many things, so she could hardly remember anyone. But Luo Zheng was an exception.</p>

  <p>She managed to find Xun in her memories.</p>

  <p>"You mean the Queen of Killings of the Demon Night? If I remember correctly, she seems to only have a single soul fragment left," Yolande said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>The disappearance of the Demon Night's Queen of Killings was widely known. The three queens were their symbols. If Xun died, a new Queen of Killings would be elected immediately to replace her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded wordlessly.</p>

  <p>Yolande continued to stare at Luo Zheng and laughed. "You want to help her to take back the throne of the Demon Night?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded again.</p>

  <p>Yolande continued cackling. "The Demon Night is so powerful that even we humans cannot ignore it. The other two queens might only be world lords, but as queens of the Demon Night, their words are often more useful than Supreme Lords'. Xun's position is of extraordinary significance, and your current strength is far from enough."</p>

  <p>"I will improve my cultivation," Luo Zheng said with a look of determination.</p>

  <p>Seeing his serious expression, Yolande giggled. "I'm not your master, so I can't change your mind. Your own will is up to you. I didn't interfere in your matters back in the Sea God Continent, and I'm not interfering now either. Once we reach the Mist Palace, I'll help you awaken Xun and repair her broken soul."</p>

  <p>"Did you just say you could repair her soul?" His eyes immediately lit up.</p>

  <p>Technically speaking, Xun's host soul had died, and the wisp of soul accompanying Luo Zheng was the only remnant soul.</p>

  <p>He thought he could only wake her up, but he didn't think that Yolande could actually repair her soul and make it good as new!</p>

  <p>Seeing the joy on his face, Yolande smiled and said, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>At her command, two horses neighed outside the carriage and the carriage trembled and hurtled forward.</p>

  <p>In almost an instant, the carriage had charged into the space channel.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" There was no space channel in this place. However, the carriage entered it, so Luo Zheng was quite curious about it.</p>

  <p>"It's just the innate theurgy of the Heavenly Phoenix Horse. It can freely enter and exit the space channel," she explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. Ever since he had ascended, he had been intrigued to know the various things that went on in the Upper World. He would probably need some time to get his head around them.</p>

  <p>Cross-world travel was a luxury for martial artists. In fact, 99 percent of the martial artists were never able to leave their own supreme worlds in their entire life. The 100, 000 supreme worlds that existed in the universe were just concepts and legends to them. They all knew about these supreme worlds, and they had heard the roars of many Supreme Lords and world lords, but they had never actually seen them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was following Yolande right now. He was going to travel thousands of supreme worlds and went to the core supreme world of the alliance. It was a very exciting prospect.</p>

  <p>The two Heavenly Phoenix Horses entered the space channel and galloped away at a dizzying speed. What surprised Luo Zheng even more was that when the Heavenly Phoenix Horses ran, they seemed to be accelerating. The legendary beasts' initial speed was not particularly fast.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng used his full strength, he might be able to catch up with them.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the Heavenly Phoenix Horses did not seem to have a limit on their speed. After running for a day, their speed had already reached an unimaginable level. On the second day, the speed was twice as fast as the first day. And on the third day, they doubled their speed once again.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Luo Zheng had been able to observe his surroundings from the supreme world channel. He had seen some martial artists flying in the same direction as them.</p>

  <p>However, on the fourth day, he was no longer able to clearly see the scenery outside his window. As the horses ran extremely fast, everything turned into blurry lines, making it impossible to tell if it was a person or something else.</p>

  <p>There were countless checkpoints in the supreme world channel, which required a fee to pass through. For an ordinary martial artist, the cost of traversing through a supreme world was astronomical. However, no one dared to stop Yolande's carriage at any checkpoint.</p>

  <p>Even if they wanted to, it was impossible for them to stop given the current speed.</p>

  <p>On the sixth day, Yolande informed Luo Zheng that they had left the Spirit Reading World.</p>

  <p>"We have left the Spirit Reading World?" Luo Zheng thought that with their speed, they would have long since entered another supreme world.</p>

  <p>According to the current speed, if they wanted to cross over a thousand supreme worlds, they would probably need almost 20 years to reach their destination.</p>

  <p>However, the speed of the Heavenly Phoenix Horses continued to increase.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Spirit Reading World, they entered the border channel, which was wider than the supreme world channel. Building these channels and connecting thousands of supreme worlds to each other like pearls in a necklace was a vast and unimaginable project.</p>

  <p>'The supreme world channels are constructed mostly by world lords, so it must be the Supreme Lords who build the border channels, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>
