<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 349 Aura's Thoughts (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Countless powerful practitioners lived in the Cloud Hall. For them, both the Cloud Sect and Burning Sky Empire were merely parts of the land under their governance. Given this, the Burning Sky Empire could only endure the suppression of the Cloud Sect for fear that they might offend the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Cloud Sect was based within the Burning Sky Empire, so their conflicts of interest were few. More often than not, they would have to unite with each other. That was the reason the thriving Cloud Sect was still willing to cultivate many Illuminating Soul Realm experts and offer them to Burning Sky Empire as a gift in return.</p>

  <p>However, since Kane Su took the throne, the entire situation was altered, for Kane's strength was as strong, or even more formidable than that of the head of Cloud Sect. Moreover, Kane Su had even joined Cloud Hall, making his status somewhat higher than the Cloud Sect head.</p>

  <p>Such news was good for the Burning Sky Empire, as they could finally take the initiative on loads of issues, leaving Cloud Sect as more of a vassal. With that, word among the folks was that the Cloud Sect's influence was waning over the recent several decades while the Burning Sky Empire's power was only spiking up.</p>

  <p>As a member of Cloud Hall, Aura's father had to facilitate it and assist in its involvement in various affairs.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that Kane was extremely powerful. From Aura's perspective, he was on a mountain so tall that no one else could survive the climb to the top. For all those years of Burning Sky Empire's existence, there was only one Kane Su.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning herself was not very strong. Because of her distinguished status as a princess, though, she had learned a great deal about the secrets of history and was well aware that there would always be someone better than herself. Even though Kane might have dominated the Eastern Region for a time, once he stepped out of its borders, he was nobody in the vast world.</p>

  <p>Inside the Cloud Hall, there were already loads of members who were showing to be stronger than Aura's father, not to mention the head and vice-head of the hall, as well as its many elders.</p>

  <p>With many showing such promise, it was possible that Kane had already met his downfall.</p>

  <p>In the past two years, Kane did not hold court even once. According to the palace, Aura's father was in closed-door training, so the crown prince, Farrell Su, Aura's brother, was temporarily in power.</p>

  <p>According to the laws of the Burning Sky Palace, if Aura's father did not show up within three years, the crown prince would take the throne and become the new emperor, meaning that Kane would be abdicated in favor of his son.</p>

  <p>If he was truly doing closed-door training, such an arrangement was fine.</p>

  <p>But the thing was, the seven princes did not believe that their father was still around and they were quite certain that Kane was meeting his downfall outside the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Such rumors gave the princes an opportunity to usurp the throne.</p>

  <p>Over the past year, the seventh prince, Conn Su, had already been preparing to take the throne, blatantly cozying up to two of the top seven noble clans, the Yun Clan and the Yu Clan. Meanwhile, the third prince, Ray Su, was also getting restless as he tried to get on good terms with the Huang Clan and the Pei Clan. At that point, their intentions were evident.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Aura's brother, the crown prince, Farrell Su, had far fewer connections than the other princes.</p>

  <p>Since Farrell was the first son of the emperor, he was conferred the title of crown prince upon birth. As an heir, he began living in the Eastern Palace, spending day after day learning the art of ruling from many great scholars. Therefore, he had fewer opportunities to build up his connections as the other princes did.</p>

  <p>Back then, who could have foreseen the disappearance of the emperor?</p>

  <p>When Conn and Ray began working their means to usurp the throne, Farrell's status was put in jeopardy.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, Farrell was still the official crown prince. Without the emperor's death being confirmed yet, the third and seventh princes had to stay put, bidding their time.</p>

  <p>Throughout history, once it came to the fight for the throne, horrifyingly brutal results were inevitable.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that one side would do away with the opposing side, leaving no possibility for the fight to end up in a draw.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, Mu Ning worried for her elder brother Farrell Su. On the other, she was not keen on seeing the descendants of the Su Family turn against each other and fight to the death. Thus, she decided to join the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Although Mu Ning did not want Cloud Sect to take control of the Burning Sky Palace, she could not find any other kind of means to intervene in the issue. The assorted noble clans in the Burning Sky Empire would probably only further aggravate the already tense situation. If the prince they supported were to be enthroned, they believed they would be able to prevail over the rest of the noble clans, so as to break the existing power structure and gain more benefits.</p>

  <p>Even though Mu Ning was a royal princess, she had no way to control the Cloud Sect and neither did Farrell as the crown prince.</p>

  <p>With a lack of other means, Mu Ning tried to find a qualified individual who could help Farrell by protecting and escorting him. Such a person, though, should not be a disciple of any of the noble clans, so she could only select from grassroots, which led her on her path to being a tutor in Drizzle Peak. Considering that Drizzle Peak was ranked last, most disciples were at grassroots level.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was well aware that to place all her hopes on a disciple of Cloud Sect was fool's talk. Throughout history, many grassroots disciples had accomplished astonishing achievements. Still, compared to the disciples of noble clans, they were very few.</p>

  <p>Left without other options, Mu Ning just had to try it as a last resort to save the hopeless situation. If one of her disciples could luckily advance by leaps and bounds, or even pass the Cloud Road test and get selected by the Cloud Hall to be admitted as a disciple, there was a chance for the trouble at the royal palace to be sorted out.</p>

  <p>Still, the probability of finding someone worthy was way too low, barely better than zero. It was no wonder others thought that going to Drizzle Peak was only a waste of time.</p>
