</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were at the top across the world.</p>

  <p>When one reached the Life and Death Realm or became a war sage, they could threaten the stability of the word if they continued to increase their cultivation. They would encounter crises that would be matters of life and death.</p>

  <p>A life and death crisis was actually a punishment to someone posed by the world when it was threatened by him or her.</p>

  <p>Once warriors reached the Soul Sea Realm, the punishments posed by the world could no longer hold them back, given their utmost strength. This was exactly why these warriors were expelled from this world and sent to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, there were conditions that had to be met for a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm to go to the Upper World. Amber's talent was amazing, and she had only spent two hundred years trying to reach the Soul Sea Realm from being a nature creature. There was still a long time for her to go to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The holy tree began to shake once Zheng and Xun had descended upon the thick trunk.</p>

  <p>The holy tree was as large as a castle, and when it shook, it felt like there was an earthquake. Amber knelt down on one knee before Xun and said in a respectful manner, "Welcome, my queen."</p>

  <p>Xun nodded indifferently, the fact that a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm was bowing before her making no change to her expression. It was as if she took it as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>Other powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm followed Amber and knelt down in unison before Xun, along with the other war sages of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred thousand members of the Demon Night kneeling at the same time on the holy tree.</p>

  <p>Every Demon Night member was looking at Xun with an incomparable piety.</p>

  <p>The three queens of the Demon Night were supremely looked up to by all of the members. In millions of Lower Worlds, there were countless sacred places belonging to the Demon Night, dedicated to them. But the three queens rarely visited the sacred places in person.</p>

  <p>Everyone belonging to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was overjoyed to see Xun visiting their sacred place.</p>

  <p>The holy tree shook even more violently as its thick branches continued to swing. Zheng could feel immense attraction to the holy tree, causing his feet to become firmly attached to it. No matter how hard the holy tree shook, he wouldn't be thrown down.</p>

  <p>As the holy tree continued to shake, clear veins began to be seen on its branches. Beams of green light flowed through the veins and converged on the trunk of the holy tree. The green light rose along the trunk and rapidly snaked its way to the branch where Zheng was standing.</p>

  <p>At the end of the branch, the light began to gush out, enveloping Xun.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Zheng exclaimed, his jaw dropping.</p>

  <p>"This is the holy tree's life energy," Cheryl explained.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>While the life energy was constantly being drawn out, the leaves on the holy tree started withering at a visible rate, as if winter had replaced spring in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that not only was this huge holy tree withering, but even the plants around it were also turning yellow.</p>

  <p>"Will the holy tree die if the life energy within it is completely extracted?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked again, stunned at the sight of the withering holy tree.</p>

  <p>Cheryl replied, unperturbed and patient, "The holy tree's life energy is indeed very precious, and we normally do not draw much life energy out of it. Only when newborn babies are put on it every year do we draw a small amount of life energy out of it. But our queen's soul is very weak right now, and she is severely injured. We have no choice but to draw ninety percent of life energy out of the holy tree."</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was still astonished, Cheryl continued to explain, "It's alright. The holy tree is full of life energy. It's impossible for it to wither because of this. It will completely recover, at most in two to three years."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I see," Zheng said, nodding in understanding.</p>

  <p>Xun continued to absorb the holy tree's life energy. This kind of pure life energy was easy to absorb and a huge amount seemed to have been done in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Once she had absorbed the life energy, Xun lowered her head to look at Amber and said stiffly, "Get up. And take me to the Queens' Statues."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my queen," Amber said, bowing.</p>

  <p>Amber, who was the number one talent of the Sea God Continent and the leader of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, stood up and respectfully led the way for Xun.</p>

  <p>Esther, Cheryl, Zheng and the rest followed them.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Demon Night remained prostrate on the ground.</p>

  <p>Amber led the way along the crimson carpet on the tree branch and soon approached the trunk of the holy tree. Inside the hollowed-out trunk was a palace.</p>

  <p>When Amber brought Xun, Zheng, and the others in, the other members who remained prostrate on the ground finally stood up.</p>

  <p>At this, the members of the Demon Night erupted in joy.</p>

  <p>"I see the queen! She really is the queen! She's exactly the same as the statue!"</p>

  <p>"Why would the queen come to our Heavenly Feather Sacred Place? She is the queen of the killings. I remember that among the three statues, her statue seems to be the dimmest."</p>

  <p>"Shh, don't talk nonsense! You will be punished if anyone overhears you!"</p>

  <p>"Something must have happened in the Upper World. Otherwise, our queen wouldn't be living in the body of a human male as his sword spirit."</p>

  <p>These speculations had already existed and had been making the rounds of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place ever since Phoebe had notified them.</p>

  <p>The queens' statues shone with an eternal holy light that did not fade even at night.</p>

  <p>But the statue of the queen of killings had suddenly dimmed in recent years.</p>

  <p>An ominous sign. It was not only in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place that Xun's statue had dimmed, but her statues across other Lower Worlds had dimmed as well.</p>

  <p>Long before this, many members of the Demon Night had guessed that something had happened to the Demon Night in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this was not something they could figure out.</p>

  <p>But due to Xun's sudden arrival, they knew that they had guessed right. However, why she had come to be in this state was something that Amber and the others weren't qualified to ask.</p>

  <p>Xun entered the huge palace and walked towards the center.</p>

  <p>There were three huge statues at the center— statues of women of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>These were all very lifelike, and each of the statues was emitting its own luster. The first statue held a huge scepter, its entire body sheathed in a faint green light. Just moving closer to it could make one feel the vigorous life energy pulsing within it.</p>

  <p>"This is the queen controlling life of the Demon Night," Cheryl reminded Zheng as she saw Zheng's gaze lingering on the statue.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded as his gaze shifted to the second statue. It was a woman wielding a murderous meteor hammer and was giving off a light blue light.</p>

  <p>It was hard to imagine the Demon Night using such a barbaric and cruel weapon.</p>

  <p>"She is the queen of punishment," Cheryl clarified.</p>

  <p>"Oh that explains it," Zheng said, turning to look at the last statue.</p>

  <p>The last one was red, but the only difference was that the red light it was bathed in was very dim. It was far from being as dazzling as the lights that brightened the other two queens' statues.</p>

  <p>The third statue looked exactly like Xun.</p>

  <p>'No wonder the members of the Demon Night were able to recognize Xun as one of their queens in just a glance. It's true that she looks exactly the same, ' Zheng thought to himself. But why was the statue holding a spear in its hand?</p>

  <p>Wasn't Xun using a sword?</p>

  <p>Back then, Zheng had accidentally obtained a sword spirit after entering the Killing Sword Mountain. The only place where Zheng and Xun had communicated was the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Since Xun had entered the Killing Sword Mountain, she must be using a sword since she had already comprehended the consummate sword intent.</p>

  <p>But the statue showed that her weapon was a spear, not a sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng was puzzled, and was just trying to figure things out when Xun stopped in front of her statue, turned around, and said, "All of you can leave. Zheng, stay behind. No one is allowed to enter the palace. It's an order."</p>

  <p>As Zheng's sword spirit, she couldn't stay too far away from him. So naturally, Zheng had to stay behind.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my queen. No one is allowed to approach the palace without your order," Amber nodded and quickly retreated from the palace, taking along Esther and the other warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>
