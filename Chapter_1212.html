  <p>
</p>

  <p>Devoid of any hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng took out the Black Star pickaxe and held it in his hand. There wasn't much time left for him. If Dorothea arrived, then he would be in a lot of trouble.</p>

  <p>However, just as he brandished the Black Star pickaxe and hit the chains, a seemingly odd scene transpired!</p>

  <p>As a supreme divine weapon, it was capable of destroying anything.</p>

  <p>There was rarely anything in the universe that it couldn't crush.</p>

  <p>And to his surprise, it actually penetrated the chains!</p>

  <p>"Is it an illusion?" Luo Luo Zheng was amazed and bewildered at the same time.</p>

  <p>The chains in front of him, as well as the Ancestral Dragon Egg that was wrapped in chains, seemed to be nothing more than illusions!</p>

  <p>He then hastily reached out his hands for the chains. His fingers infiltrated through them with ease, and he felt nothing!</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Luo Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>Both the chains in front of him and the Ancestral Dragon Egg in the center were life-like. He couldn't assimilate that they were only illusions.</p>

  <p>He could see them, but he couldn't touch anything.</p>

  <p>Brianna smiled faintly and remarked, "If I guessed it right, the Ancestral Dragon Egg is sealed in another layer of space, so you can see it, but you cannot touch it!"</p>

  <p>"Another layer of space?"</p>

  <p>He was confused at her words. He was indeed proficient in the Space Law, and even before he had gone through the baptism of Laws, his affinity with the Space Law had achieved an unprecedentedly high level.</p>

  <p>Although after undergoing the baptism of Laws, he had no problem cultivating any Original Laws, he was still the most sensitive to the Space Law.</p>

  <p>At any rate, he had only reached the second layer of the Space Law. If he was given enough time to practice in the four divine kingdoms and was able to obtain the totems carrying the third and fourth layers of Space Law, he might have the chance to gradually comprehend them.</p>

  <p>However, after he came to the four divine kingdoms, there was not much time for him to practice. From the moment he entered the Harlen Divine Kingdom, he had busied himself in achieving his goal of finding and accumulating the life stones. Later on, he participated in the competition by the side of the West Dragon River. After that, he entered the Feather Holy Sea. He rarely had any time to think about anything else.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if I am not mistaken, this should be the fifth layer of the Space Law, the so-called Refraction! This Ancestral Dragon Egg seems to be sealed in another space. Everything you see is only the refraction through space! It is simply impossible to take out the Ancestral Dragon Egg that easily!" Brianna shook her head and added, "Unfortunately, I don't specialize in Space Law. Back then, I could only comprehend a layer of it."</p>

  <p>"Because of this reason, War King Wind and the other rulers were unable to take away the Ancestral Dragon Egg?" Luo Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>After all, mastering the Original Law required much effort and skill to deal with it. The first layer was relatively easy. The second layer was extremely difficult. And if one wanted to master the third layer of the Original Law, one must possess a divine-level talent at the least, and those martial artists who could master the fourth layer were likely to be the core members of their race, even in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>As for the fifth layer, it wasn't something that an ordinary martial artist could reach.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure flashed as he traveled through space. He instinctively stretched out an arm towards the Ancestral Dragon Egg in the center.</p>

  <p>Just like earlier, he seemed to be grasping a mirage of the Ancestral Dragon Egg. These chains and this Ancestral Dragon Egg were all indeed illusions!</p>

  <p>"It's useless. If my guess is correct, those warriors from the Celestial Position also didn't master the Space Law well. They can't take out the Ancestral Dragon Egg, so they came up with another method," Brianna calmly stated.</p>

  <p>"What method?" Luo Luo Zheng probed further.</p>

  <p>"It's so simple. They try to accelerate the ripening of this Ancestral Dragon Egg! They plan to change the time flow rate by accelerating it in the entire steeple. With time flow rate increased by one thousand times, they will wait for the Ancestral Dragon to hatch. Soon after the Ancestor Dragon comes out, they can take it away," Brianna assumed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. This time, he completely agreed with her analysis. But, his eyebrows furrowed again. "Now that I have entered this steeple, doesn't it mean that the Time Law will also apply to me? Wouldn't it be too long before this Ancestral Dragon Egg hatches if I wait right here?"</p>

  <p>The rate of time flow was considered normal beyond the extent of influence of Time Law. But within the range, time flew a thousand times faster. Now that Luo Luo Zheng was within this range, his time flow rate seemed to be in sync with that of the Ancestral Dragon Egg.</p>

  <p>"Your analysis makes sense. If you want to wait for the Ancestral Dragon Egg to hatch, there might be hope if the Ancestral Dragon is about to break out of the shell. Otherwise, the only thing you can do is leave the range of the Time Law and slowly wait?" Brianna blinked her eyes as she went on.</p>

  <p>"This... This will be even more troublesome." For a moment, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't think of a better way.</p>

  <p>It was also at this moment when Luo Luo Zheng instantaneously heard the sound of footsteps approaching. When he looked down, he saw Dorothea climbing up the stairs, and their eyes met.</p>

  <p>Dorothea let out a small wicked smile and mocked, "I'll forgive you this time. But you destroyed the enchanted barrier outside. Delroy would not easily let you go. Obediently follow me out of here! Well, it's not too late!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng breathed out lightly. The biggest drawback after he entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place this time was that he couldn't use his own abilities. Although he had taken over Brianna's body, it was still impossible to utilize her full strength. It was so depressing.</p>

  <p>However, this group of warriors were all at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>They could not be underestimated even in the Upper World!</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng had not been affected by the power of the Feather Holy Sea's blood sacrifice, he would still be like an ant in front of these masters of the Spirit Supreme Realm with his current strength at the Life and Death Realm. He would not be able to fight back.</p>

  <p>"Good girl, come with me!" Dorothea continued to laugh as she lightly stepped onto the stairs and slowly walked up.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, Luo Zheng's gaze happened to land on the Ancestral Dragon Egg. He noticed that a tiny crack had appeared on it!</p>

  <p>"A crack?"</p>

  <p>"You are so lucky, this Ancestral Dragon is coming out!" He heard Brianna's voice.</p>

  <p>"But that woman is coming!" Luo Luo Zheng communicated with Brianna in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Find a way to delay her. The Ancestral Dragon has the imprinting behavior! As soon as it comes out from the egg, it will follow and become attached to the first moving object it encounters!" Brianna pointed out.</p>

  <p>The hatch of the Ancestral Dragon Egg would take a long time beyond anyone's imagination. It was true that the power of the blood sacrifice exerted by the Dragon Lineage Human had sealed the place for that long time, and Luo Luo Zheng had no inkling on how long the Time Law had been in effect here. If the Celestial Position entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place a year ago, then under a time flow rate that was a thousand times faster than the normal time flow rate, the time had passed for close to a thousand years in this space.</p>

  <p>Regardless of this, when he arrived here, the Ancestral Dragon Egg had finally cracked. Perhaps this was to be considered his luck!</p>

  <p>"Imprinting behavior..." Luo Luo Zheng didn't have time to mull over the meaning of this phrase. Dorothea was already walking up to him step by step. He needed to find a topic to delay her.</p>

  <p>He turned to her after some thought as an idea came to his mind and asked, "Celestial Position, do you all belong to Celestial Position?"</p>

  <p>When Dorothea heard him mention the Celestial Position, she was surprised. She asked with confusion, "Eh? How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>He grinned slightly, then replied, "It's because I also belong to the Celestial Position!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Dorothea showed an expression of disbelief. She giggled and exclaimed, "It's impossible! Every member of our Celestial Position possesses a special mark. If you are a warrior recognized by our Celestial Position, I must be feeling the existence of that mark!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly as his expression became more at ease. "You should have noticed that this body doesn't belong to me, right?"</p>

  <p>Dorothea nodded her head. Her power to restrain the Soul Cores was also effective on the girl in front of her, which meant that she had also relied on the Soul Core to control the physical body she was in now.</p>

  <p>However, Dorothea didn't know about the Soul Sealing Spell on Brianna, so she felt very strange about the body in front of her as well. It was a living physical body, so why did she still need to control her physical body through the Soul Core? Wouldn't it be unnecessary?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's explanation, however, sort of answered some of her doubts.</p>

  <p>"You said that you obtained the recognition of the Celestial Position. But to think that you are only a martial artist from the Lower World, how did you gain the recognition of our Celestial Position?'' Dorothea probed with a smile. She refused to believe what Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>From the corner of his eyes, he noted the crack on the Ancestral Dragon Egg was slowly spreading. He then quickly replied, "Tower, I obtained the recognition of Celestial Position in a tower!"</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin originally belonged to the Celestial Position, so what he said was the truth.</p>
