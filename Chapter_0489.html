<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 489 Broken Sword (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The senior disciple's sword clinked again and a thousand flowers formed to launch countless attacks. He had much faith in his skills and didn't think Zheng could see through his rapid moves. The only outcome he saw for Zheng was defeat.</p>

  <p>Also watching from not far away was Elder Ge, who shook his head at what he saw. Zheng was a good disciple and a skillful fighter, but he was no match for Evan, yet. Even though they were competing in swordsmanship, Evan's energy storage gave him the advantage. The combat wasn't fair for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Up until that point, Zheng had blocked two of Evan's attacks. But he had reached his limit and was close to the extreme. All he could manage now was the defensive posture "circle parry", but had no other means to attack.</p>

  <p>In a sword fight, defense was often the worst. Many textbooks said that "the best defense is offense". Thus many swordplay schools had even abandoned teaching defensive skills and instead focused on offensive skills. As long as opponents were pinned down during a fierce attack, victory for the one with the upper hand was inevitable.</p>

  <p>That was Evan's current strategy. He intended to disrupt Zheng with his quick attacks, then defeat him at the third attack!</p>

  <p>But just as everyone thought Zheng would lose the fight, all of a sudden, something happened.</p>

  <p>"Clink, cli - clunk!"</p>

  <p>As Evan's attacks were deflected, the tinkling sound continued to ring, when all of a sudden, a loud clunk permeated the air causing the entire combat field to vibrate. It was Evan's sword, and it had cracked during collision, its front half gone.</p>

  <p>"W...what?"</p>

  <p>Evan held the broken sword and stood frozen in a posture for attack. His eyes nearly popped out of shock.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at him in silence, Zheng included.</p>

  <p>No one expected to see this happen! What kind of fighter broke his weapon in the middle of a fight? Was that not being irresponsible and unprofessional?</p>

  <p>From where she stood, Yan giggled and gloated.</p>

  <p>Only she knew the reason why the sword snapped. Commonly, senior disciples like Evan owned fairy weapons. But Evan lost his in a bet with Yan. He should have exchanged points to get another one, but he had been too busy improving his strength to earn points and get a new sword.</p>

  <p>So all this time, Evan was only using an ordinary mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>That was also the reason why he entered this competition. He wanted to take the opportunity to ask Kenneth for a favor - a new fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>According to the tournament guidelines, the first prize was a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>So this whole time, Evan was merely using a make-shift weapon that was mediocre at best.</p>

  <p>A mysterious weapon was no match for a spiritual weapon, let alone a fairy weapon. But Evan had somehow used his regular sword in a fairy-weapon way.</p>

  <p>If he didn't use the Falling Flowers Sword to attack, he would've saved himself from the embarrassment. The sword would not have broken so soon. Usually, in fights, swords crossed several times.</p>

  <p>But the Falling Flowers Sword was different. For those using this, the speed of the attack was a critical factor. And for every second, the sword thrust thousands of times.</p>

  <p>In their previous combat, Evan chopped at Zheng with his sword countless times but was blocked each time. So, his make-shift sword collided with Zheng's Streamer Sword for many, many times.</p>

  <p>How could an ordinary mysterious weapon withstand such forceful collisions?</p>

  <p>And finally, the stress due to the collisions accumulated to create a mass that caused a change in the shape of Evan's sword, resulting in damage.</p>

  <p>Looking at the damaged sword, Zheng breathed a sigh of relief and momentarily relaxed. He knew a broken sword did not mean victory for him. After all, this was merely a friendly competition, and Evan could always borrow a sword somewhere.</p>

  <p>But this setback gave him a chance to recover, regroup, and take time to think of a way to defeat the Falling Flowers Sword.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Evan wanted to scream out loud.</p>

  <p>He was on the verge of winning, but the bloody sword denied him the victory. How could his sword snap at this crucial juncture?</p>

  <p>He tossed the broken sword violently, and with a mournful face approached Elder Ge for help.</p>

  <p>"Elder Ge, could you please lend me a sword?"</p>

  <p>Reluctantly, the Cloud Sect elder shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't use a sword, so how can I lend you any."</p>

  <p>Hearing the reply, Evan looked at the one hundred thousand disciples watching the match and begged, "Would any of you lend me a sword?"</p>

  <p>To his utter dismay, no one responded to his request.</p>

  <p>Disheartened, Evan swore in his mind, 'Damn it! I am the most senior disciple of Cloud Sect. How dare these people deny me like this! I swear to God that if I don't enter Cloud Hall and remain an Elder in Cloud Sect, I would kick everyone's sorry asses!'</p>

  <p>Finally, he threw Yan a hopeful glance. Before he could speak, the female warrior had already anticipated him.</p>

  <p>"And what should you call me?" she teased.</p>

  <p>Although Yan was no longer kept in Hell Mountain, her true identity was still a secret. She didn't want Evan to call her by name.</p>

  <p>Evan understood what she meant. With a resigned sigh, he said, "My Queen, can I have my Cloud Return Sword back?"</p>

  <p>"What did you say? Your Cloud Return Sword?" Yan's eyes flashed. Her brows were raised to mock Evan.</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no! I didn't say that. I mean, you're the current owner of the Cloud Return Sword. Can I borrow your Cloud Return Sword, please?"</p>

  <p>The senior disciple knew he had to ask nicely. After all, he had lost the sword to Yan, and he had to rely on her mercy to use it again.</p>

  <p>His tone pleased Yan, and she looked at him with a smile of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>But as Evan thought she was about to lend him the sword, her smile disappeared. She answered coldly, "No, you can't."</p>

  <p>"Goo...what? What did you say? You said no? You piece of..." Evan felt like swearing but held back his tongue. Yan was his last hope. And Cloud Return Sword was originally his weapon, which he used for a long time. The sword was so familiar to him like it was a part of his body.</p>

  <p>Using it again would give him the edge. And submitting to humiliation was his only choice.</p>

  <p>But the true reason for refusing Evan was simple. Yan had spotted Zheng immersed in meditation and she knew he was thinking of ways to defeat Evan. She was simply buying him time.</p>

  <p>The fight was not a fair competition. And it was reasonable for her to help her brother to win.</p>

  <p>As neither could convince the other, Zheng decided to interrupt. He opened his eyes and with a confident smile suggested to Yan, "Let him borrow the sword."</p>
