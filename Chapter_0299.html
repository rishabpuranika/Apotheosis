<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sean and Nory were not as surprised as Wurth.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Luo Zheng, this dainty, pretty girl complained that he did not visit her! Luo Zheng must have a lot of charm to bewitch her like this.</p>

  <p>'When exactly did Luo Zheng meet Nina?' they wondered. 'Did they meet at the trial for slaying demons?'</p>

  <p>"Hey, Luo Zheng, won't you give us an introduction? Is this your girlfriend?"</p>

  <p>Sean, who was older than Luo Zheng, teased him.</p>

  <p>Nory was more flippant and straightforward. He straightened and gave Nina a solemn salute. "How are you, Zheng's girlfriend?"</p>

  <p>"Don't say nonsense!" Nina rebuked him, but her face broke into a flush.</p>

  <p>She didn't really seem to mind how Zheng's friends addressed her.</p>

  <p>Zheng's friends were quite perceptive, so how could they not make out what that blush meant? Generally speaking, it was a universal sign indicating that a girl harbored a crush on a guy.</p>

  <p>"Okay, fine! I won't talk nonsense anymore. I will reserve calling you that for the future!" Nory responded, casting Yates a short, casual look.</p>

  <p>Nory was naive but not ignorant. Yates had been particularly attentive to Nina ever since she walked in. As per what Nory observed, Yates obviously held some kind of affection for her. The more he teased Nina about Luo Zheng, the more dispirited and indignant Yates got.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Nina gave a snort and wrinkled her nose in chagrin. She turned to her friends, calling them from a distance. "Girls... Come here. I want to introduce you to someone. This is  Luo Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, a few girls came up to her, huddling and checking out Luo Zheng from head to toe with their wide, pretty eyes. They immediately launched into a stream of comments.</p>

  <p>"So, this is Luo Zheng! No wonder you always talk about him, Nina. Listening to you describe him is not as good as actually meeting him in person. He is so handsome!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, his eyes are so bright, they seem to glow!"</p>

  <p>"Wow, I should have taken part in the last trial of slaying demons too!</p>

  <p>How exhilarating it must have been to be saved by him from the demon generals!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea that the stories of him defeating the demon general and saving Nina from the clutches of another five of them had spread throughout Lady Peak!</p>

  <p>Apparently, he was more popular there than he was at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Those sentiments were not widely shared by the disciples at Drizzle Peak. His fellow participants there were tight-lipped about his astonishing feats at the trial for slaying demons.</p>

  <p>The female disciples talked in whispers among themselves, their faces lit up with excitement. Except for Yetta, who appeared disinterested and aloof, everyone sang praises of Luo Zheng and was in awe of his heroics.</p>

  <p>Yetta, who was Nina's best friend, was, of course, aware of Zheng's valor.</p>

  <p>Nina had described him more than once as a great hero. In addition, the other female disciples who had taken part in the trial took note of Zheng's gallantry.</p>

  <p>At any other time and place, Yetta too would have participated and expressed her admiration for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, today, Yetta had invited Nina to meet her family at the repeated requests of her brother, Yates. She knew Yates had feelings for Nina.</p>

  <p>She had not expected Luo Zheng to be here when she brought Nina along. What a strange coincidence. Now, Yetta was in a quandary.</p>

  <p>It looked like it was Nory who brought Luo Zheng here.</p>

  <p>Out of the tens of thousands of disciples at Drizzle Peak, not to mention many more in the entirety of Cloud Sect, why was it Nory who happened to be Zheng's friend?!</p>

  <p>Yetta looked at Yates, who stood at a distance, from the corner of her eye.</p>

  <p>She watched quietly how her brother's face darkened with ire. He was not enjoying any of this.</p>

  <p>Nina was like an unattainable goddess to Yates. He had admired and looked up to her ever since he first met her, like he couldn't stop himself from doing so.</p>

  <p>He knew his chances of winning Nina's heart were slim, but that didn't mean they were in the negative. So, he wanted to give it a try.</p>

  <p>Though the Mo family had almost declined now, it was still a noble clan.</p>

  <p>Yates was talented, and if he worked hard, he could become the next head of the Mo family.</p>

  <p>When Yates became the family head, he would be qualified to court Nina.</p>

  <p>It pleased him that his sister brought Nina to the house.</p>

  <p>He had been preparing for this for a long time. He had even arranged for various entertainment programs for her. He would do anything to please Nina!</p>

  <p>But not once had he imagined that he would encounter such a scene when Nina finally arrived at the Mo family's house. Judging by how she was acting, Nina had a crush on this guy, Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A sense of deep frustration rose in his chest and took hold of him. Yates felt his strength slip away from him. Why was this happening to him?</p>

  <p>Yates's friends, who stood around him, also grew gloomy and resentful.</p>

  <p>They were well aware that Yates wanted to pursue Nina. However, judging from what was happening before them, things were not unfolding as they had hoped for.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Yates clenched his fists, a fierce look flashing across his eyes.</p>

  <p>A mad thought occurred to him. 'I will kill Luo Zheng by any and all means!'</p>

  <p>Noticing his grim appearance, a friend next to him pressed his hand on his fist and shook his head slowly. "Yates, calm down," he said to him in a hushed voice. "Luo Zheng is unusual and very strong. It wouldn't be a good idea to come to blows with him."</p>

  <p>Yates certainly could not kill Luo Zheng here.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did seem powerful. The momentum that he unleashed was astonishing. Although he was only at the first grade of nature level, the disciples of the Cloud Sect knew that the realm was sometimes inconsistent when it came to strength. Moreover, according to what the female disciples surrounding Luo Zheng just said, he had killed some demon generals!</p>
