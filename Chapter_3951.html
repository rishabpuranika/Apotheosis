<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Thin blood lines formed clear words on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's arm.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has driven away all the guards above. You are safe now," the words stated.</p>

  <p>The emperor's eyes widened in disbelief when he saw the words on his arm.</p>

  <p>Had Zheng entered Stage Thirty-three?</p>

  <p>It was truly unbelievable!</p>

  <p>He had met Zheng twice in the Oneness Sky Palace, and he thought that the young warrior was exceptional back then.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng led the human race to occupy Stage Fourteen after he entered the Desire World.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had high expectations for Zheng, and he even believed that Zheng might reach the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>However, the news he received was a little too much.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that Zheng had entered the Grand Pure Realm after just a short time!</p>

  <p>He cast his thoughts aside and stretched out his hand, then pushed Yasamin, who was nearby. When Yasamin opened her eyes and saw the words, she too was surprised.</p>

  <p>It felt uncomfortable to be soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water for such a long time, and the undercurrents were quite dangerous.</p>

  <p>Back then, when the enemies and three sturgeons hunted her down, she had no choice but to enter the undercurrents. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi hadn't found the passage at the bottom of the undercurrents, she would have died a long time ago.</p>

  <p>The two of them waited at the bottom of the undercurrents for quite some time. Sometimes, Eastern Emperor Taiyi quietly went out and investigated the situation, but the enemies were extremely patient and did not give them a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>The last time he went to the river's surface to check, he almost could not come back because the beasts from the undercurrents attacked him.</p>

  <p>Now, the two of them felt somewhat uneasy these days.</p>

  <p>How did the Oneness Sky Palace fare since its only two members at the Eternal Realm got trapped?</p>

  <p>It was very likely that before their opponents killed them on the Other Shore, they had died in the Source World.</p>

  <p>They didn't know that both the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill underwent tremendous changes.</p>

  <p>Just then, Yasamin fished out a thin needle from her grey hair. Then, she rushed towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi to respond to the words on his arm.</p>

  <p>In turn, Eastern Emperor Taiyi glared at her, but he realized that the people in the Source World were watching him. Thus, he had no choice but to let her write on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Got it. We'll go up now."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Pear Hill, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Zheng perked up when they saw those words.</p>

  <p>After all, they could finally have a break if Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin could save themselves in that way.</p>

  <p>Of course, the people of the Oneness Sky Palace were more ecstatic.</p>

  <p>They had been living in Pear Hill since they arrived in the place.</p>

  <p>Even if they couldn't return to the Bloom Divine Province soon, the return of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin still gave them a sense of belonging.</p>

  <p>Flamine even had tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back to the Other Shore," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Okay, but we need to be careful," Fuxi said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan entered the Other Shore again and waited by the Divine River.</p>

  <p>After Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin came out of the narrow passage, they followed the undercurrents to the left.</p>

  <p>Although the undercurrents here were complicated, Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew them very well.</p>

  <p>There were two exits out of the undercurrents. If they missed any of them, then they would get lost.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they found their way out. However, strong currents came at them after they left the two exits.</p>

  <p>The currents were so strong that the weaker creatures from the Other Shore couldn't even stand in them.</p>

  <p>But since Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were Eternal Realm cultivators, they weren't worried. They slowly moved sideways through the currents. They would reach the river's surface once they crossed the currents, so both of them couldn't help but speed up.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that Eastern Emperor Taiyi's arm was bleeding.</p>

  <p>He had always been a very cautious man. If it had been another time, he would surely heal the wounds first, but now that he knew that they had a chance to escape, he forgot all about it.</p>

  <p>There was very little blood that gushed out from the wounds, but some monsters in the undercurrents were highly sensitive.</p>

  <p>In the cave below the undercurrents, a large and flat mouth suddenly opened up, then a dark green tongue stuck out from the many rows of sharp teeth.</p>

  <p>Even though the blood got diluted in the Soul Interdicting Water and his body was invisible, the dark green beast still targeted him.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Water whirled like a hurricane, then monsters with spikes emerged out of the cave one after another.</p>

  <p>They formed a neat line and swam along with the strong undercurrents.</p>

  <p>At that point, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin already came out of the undercurrents and floated upward.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had gotten close to the surface of the river. Suddenly, he stopped Yasamin and cautiously looked around.</p>

  <p>They knew nothing about the outside world. What if the person who wrote on his arm was not from the Oneness Sky Palace?</p>

  <p>However, Yasamin didn't think much about it. If their bodies did fall into the hands of the enemy, then the enemy did not have to try hard to lure them out. They could just kill them there.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Eastern Emperor Taiyi slowly surfaced and looked vigilantly at the shore. His trepidation was replaced with joy when he saw Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>But, he was confused when he saw a large, fifty-foot-tall creature beside Fuxi. Who was that? Wasn't Zheng waiting for him?</p>

  <p>Where was Zheng? "Eastern Emperor Taiyi, you can come up now," King Ieuan said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Fuxi also waved at Eastern Emperor Taiyi while the Snake Goddess asked,</p>

  <p>"Where is Madam Yasamin?"</p>

  <p>"I'll ask her to come up as well," Eastern Emperor Taiyi answered.</p>

  <p>Then, he looked down into the river as he spoke. His face suddenly changed, and he plunged into the water.</p>

  <p>While Yasamin waited for him to confirm the situation on the shore, she suddenly saw him rush towards her. When she looked down, she found a long string of grey, obscure objects. Upon a closer look, she saw more than ten monsters that stayed connected at the ends.</p>

  <p>"Giant Turbid Crocodiles!"</p>

  <p>The Giant Turbid Crocodiles rarely appeared alone. Every time they appeared, there would be at least a few or even dozens of them. Moreover, they swam close to each other end-to-end. That was why, from a distance, they looked like a big snake under the water.</p>

  <p>They were considered powerful predators in undercurrents. Their prey couldn't escape their clutches, and they tore them to pieces and swallowed them up in only a few seconds.</p>

  <p>As soon as Yasamin snapped back to her senses, she quickly swam upward, but the Giant Turbid Crocodiles moved very fast. It wasn't long before the Giant Turbid Crocodile in the front bit her.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who had just returned for her, grabbed hold of her body and dragged her up the Divine River.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that he could withstand the power of a Giant Turbid Crocodile, so he could bring Yasamin up to the surface.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, all the other Giant Turbid Crocodiles bit on the tail of the Giant Turbid Crocodile in the front and dragged it down. As a result, Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi sank as well.</p>

  <p>The people on the shore didn't know what had happened. Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin did not show up after a long time, but bubbles surged violently from where Eastern Emperor Taiyi dived in. The Snake Goddess began to look worried and said, "Oh no! Are they in trouble?"</p>

  <p>Before she could say anything else, Zheng took a big step forward and quickly dived into the Divine River.</p>
