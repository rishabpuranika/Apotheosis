<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1940 The Boundary Wall (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"This guy is something else... He has finally begun to show his real strength!"</p>

  <p>Lone exclaimed as he stared at the Boundary Cloud that flew across the sky.</p>

  <p>He felt that Luo Zheng had finally gotten serious. No one could comprehend Zheng's actual skills.</p>

  <p>Nathan clenched his teeth as he looked at the Boundary Cloud that expanded rapidly in the sky. Worry and terror painted his face.</p>

  <p>Previously, he pitied and looked down at Luo Zheng as he was the only one among the group who hadn't become a world lord.</p>

  <p>As the Godly Geniuses of the Evolutionary Universe, they should at least reach the level of world lords after the practice in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Their titles were synonymous with their privileges.</p>

  <p>Only world lords had the right to condense their Godly Tiles and go further to become True Gods!</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they would always remain as Godly Geniuses. The only way to improve was to surpass the level of a world lord.</p>

  <p>They were all still young. Blessed with extraordinary talent and incredible perception, these Godly Geniuses were more powerful than others of the same level. When they were at the Spirit Transformation Realm, they were able to contend against someone like a world lord.</p>

  <p>However, it still wasn't enough!</p>

  <p>The ones who could decide the fate of the Evolutionary Universe weren't the hundreds of thousands of world lords, or the hundred-plus Supreme Lords, but the True Gods!</p>

  <p>If these Godly Geniuses wanted to participate in a battle to save the Evolutionary Universe, they had to quickly become world lords and then master the Godly Ways that they cultivated.</p>

  <p>Right then, as Nathan saw the way the Boundary Cloud spread, he immediately felt that it was foolish of him to pity Luo Zheng before. The momentum of the spread of the Boundary Cloud was extremely fast.</p>

  <p>However, previously, Zheng's Boundary Cloud had only spread six miles or so. Additionally, even though the speed of the spread of Zheng's Boundary Cloud was extremely fast, there was still a long way to go. It was still small compared to the distance of twenty miles that Nathan's Boundary Cloud had traveled.</p>

  <p>The expressions of the Godly Geniuses that watched the scene in the sky were all different. Still, most of them were pleased to see Zheng's performance. Some of them were even a bit proud. After all, Luo Zheng was their comrade!</p>

  <p>The Dragon Flyer race was stunned by what they had just seen above their heads. Wide eyes and open mouth decorated their faces as they gawked at the Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>The boundary-forming power was produced within the world inside the body of a world lord. Its impact on the outside world was somewhat limited. Martial artists also couldn't control the speed or the intensity of the Boundary Cloud as it spread. It was because of this particular characteristic that Boundary Clouds were used to judge a world lord's strength.</p>

  <p>"Could it be that this boy's boundary-forming power has leaked out by itself…?" An elder of the Dragon Flyer race wondered with his eyes wide open as he looked at the sky.</p>

  <p>"The process of an inner world changing into a great world is a natural one. The boundary-forming power is basically uncontrollable. How could it possibly come out?" another elder retorted. However, disbelief was also seen in his face.</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't the case, how could a Boundary Cloud have expanded like this? Is this possible?"</p>

  <p>"How could he manage to do that? Maybe that kid's boundary-forming power is originally mighty and powerful?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! To be able to make the Boundary Cloud spread so fast, just how strong would his boundary-forming power be? Is that still a world lord?"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The two elders argued endlessly over the matter. Their curious and disbelief led them to be more interested in Zheng's Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>"The two of you stop arguing!" The head of the Dragon Flyer race shouted. "Let's see what happens in the end!" A dignified and respectable Mu Ning radiated from him as he reprimanded the two elders.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Flyer race had speculated about the background of these nine Godly Geniuses. It was expected that all nine of them would give a performance that would surpass any other martial artist from the other races. However, the Dragon Flyer race never thought the performance of the nine would be so unbelievable. Aside from the distance it traveled, a Boundary Cloud was also judged by the intensity and speed of its spread.</p>

  <p>The brown-colored Boundary Cloud was indeed very fast. However, it was hard to say whether it could spread over 20 miles. So it was useless for them to debate.</p>

  <p>However, as if the elders had expected it...</p>

  <p>Within seconds, Zheng's Boundary Cloud had ceased to spread.</p>

  <p>Although the speed at which the brown Boundary Cloud spreading was extremely fast, it quickly lost momentum and stopped at a distance of fourteen miles.</p>

  <p>"It stopped just like that? What happened?" Lone curled his lips. It was such a letdown to see the fast spread of Zheng's Boundary Cloud to have immediately stopped.</p>

  <p>"The Boundary Cloud has not disappeared yet. Don't jump to conclusions," Lucille calmly said with a trace of expectation on her face.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's breakthrough should be different from ours," Tianming calmly analyzed. He knew part of Zheng's secrets, but he wasn't sure of it entirely as he wasn't Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even Bromley, who created the Primal Chaos Technique, wouldn't be able to analyze the scene before everyone's eyes if he were there, let alone Tianming.</p>

  <p>The two elders of the Dragon Flyer race began to argue again...</p>

  <p>"I already said it before. His boundary-forming power must have leaked out on its own. It might have caused the vitality between heaven and earth to become so unstable," the elder who had spoken up before firmly believed in his own judgment. His face even reflected a smug smile.</p>

  <p>The other elder only coldly glanced at the sky. "His Boundary Cloud hasn't disappeared yet!" His eyes reflected his expectations.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Boundary Cloud covered a range of fourteen miles. To the ordinary world lords, this could be considered an extremely outstanding achievement.</p>
