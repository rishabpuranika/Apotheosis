  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the past, the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan could work together to fight against the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>But now, the Yellow Emperor Guards were much stronger than them, so they did not stand a chance to defeat them. They refused to make the same choice as other powerful clans, so the best option for them at this point was to retreat to the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>A month later, at the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Augustus was floating in the air. He gently brought his hands together and uttered, "Grow!"</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>On cue, giant trees rose one after another reaching out their leafy branches heavenwards.</p>

  <p>These trees grew rapidly, and before long they were towering trees swaying in the breeze.</p>

  <p>When the trees had grown to a certain height, the branches intertwined to form exquisite tree houses.</p>

  <p>This was a very easy thing for Augustus to do.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, several Holy Beings were gathered in the Immortal Mansion and an urgent discussion was underway.</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later, the Yellow Emperor Guards will attack us. If we really can't oppose them, then I will willingly surrender. Ha-ha!" The one who was speaking was Vanessa, the leader of the Mysterious Soul Building.</p>

  <p>She looked like a girl of just thirteen or fourteen. She had a delicate but intelligent face, full of irresistible charm. She was seated on the chair with her slender legs crossed gracefully.</p>

  <p>"Vanessa, don't talk nonsense," reprimanded Moon.</p>

  <p>They knew Vanessa was joking.</p>

  <p>People who knew her well were fully aware of her personality? fiery and forthright!</p>

  <p>She was not the strongest among the Holy Beings, but the universe she had created was perfect.</p>

  <p>She had launched three universe battles and won every time. She had let the opponents go in two battles, and she had slaughtered a Holy Being by destroying his universe in the other battle.</p>

  <p>Other Holy Beings might pay allegiance to the alliance of the powerful clans, but it would be a cold day in hell before she would surrender.</p>

  <p>"Luo Xiao has finally returned after going through a lot of suffering. Luo Zheng has also killed Nicholas for revenge. Unexpectedly, Samuel has risen to power and released all the Yellow Emperor Guards. This is turning out to be a disaster," another person said from the other side of the hall.</p>

  <p>The man, who had a pair of weird-looking horns on his forehead, was Holy Jay, the lord of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>He had been cultivating in seclusion all these years and had never showed up in the divine land. When he heard of the turmoil in the divine land, he, too, was flabbergasted and had to abandon his hermitage and come to the divine land to find out what was happening.</p>

  <p>The young man in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land on whom he had placed great hopes didn't disappoint him. After all, he had contributed nearly one third of his strength source. Although it was a replenishable resource, it was quite a generous act for a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>When he finished his closed-door cultivation, he entered the Swirl Forest with the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I will fight it out with them," Woodruff, who was beside Holy Jay, said self-assuredly.</p>

  <p>Moon looked at Woodruff and asked, "How exactly do you intend to fight with them?"</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>Woodruff was also aware of the difference between him and the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had learned the Truth of Divine Dao in varying degrees. It would be an extraordinary feat for anyone to reach the consummation of the Truth of Divine Dao. The powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm were undoubtedly very powerful.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao said, "Since you've made your choice, I have something to say. Even if the forbidden land falls, we still have a place to retreat!"</p>

  <p>The three Holy Beings of the Moon Clan were surprised to hear Luo Xiao's words. Moon knew that Luo Xiao wouldn't talk without thinking. His eyes lit up as he asked, "Luo Xiao, what are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao replied, "We can leave the divine land and make our home elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we can't do that. The Yellow Emperor Guards can still chase us and find us," Moon said sadly, shaking his head in disappointment at Luo Xiao's suggestion.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao said, "The Yellow Emperor Guards aren't invincible. We have powerful reinforcements outside the divine land, but they haven't yet broken the space barrier so they are unable to enter the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Are these strong reinforcements you talk of also warriors at the Other Shore Realm?" Moon asked as he stood up.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings' eyes lit up at this prospect as well.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao nodded his head in affirmation. "They are stronger than the Yellow Emperor Guards in the divine land."</p>

  <p>The strength of the warriors at the Other Shore Realm was another level altogether.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao was very impressed by the almost invincible duo? Emily and Timotheus.</p>

  <p>"In fact, this piece of information is known to the alliance of the powerful clans. And that was why Nicholas was so anxious to go to the Abyss Demon Region. Unfortunately, he has been replaced by Samuel," Luo Xiao continued.</p>

  <p>"I see." Back then, Moon had been rather confused when the alliance of the powerful clans had rushed into the Abyss Demon Region. But now, he was finally seeing why.</p>

  <p>He asked, "But how can you be so sure that they will protect us?"</p>

  <p>"Because they are Nine Li Guards, people of our Nine Li race," Li Luoshui said.</p>

  <p>She had been standing quietly behind Luo Xiao listening to the entire exchange.</p>

  <p>"That's great. We can leave the divine land with our people right now. When the warriors at the Other Shore Realm break the space barrier of the divine land, we can return," Vanessa said happily.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao shook his head and said, "No, we have something more important to do in the divine land."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Moon asked apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Let my son enter the Mountain of Holy Beings," answered Luo Xiao.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings exchanged stunned looks with one other.</p>

  <p>"Luo Xiao, you have got to be kidding me!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is in no hurry to become a Holy Being. Then why the rush?"</p>

  <p>"And even if he does become a Holy Being, he can't change anything, right?"</p>

  <p>The crowd couldn't fathom Luo Xiao's plan of action. It was meaningless to have one more Holy Being. Plus it was a huge risk to go into the Mountain of Holy Beings right now.</p>

  <p>But Holy Jay knew the reason behind Luo Xiao's seemingly foolish decision.</p>

  <p>He also knew what it meant for the Mountain of Holy Beings to come in advance.</p>

  <p>"This matter is very important to me and Luo Zheng," Luo Xiao answered flatly. "So when the Mountain of Holy Beings opens two months later, I hope you can help me."</p>

  <p>"The Mountain of Holy Beings is located on the side of the Time Sea. At that time, I'm afraid that the security from the alliance of the powerful clans will be heavier. If the Yellow Emperor Guards were to stop him from entering the mountain, it would put him in a tough spot," said Moon, trying to make Luo Xiao see reason. He really couldn't understand why Luo Zheng had to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay said with a small smile, "It seems that I have to go to the Soul Wilderness because we need Estelle's help. It's a pity that Bromley hasn't returned. When he does, things will be much easier."</p>

  <p>While the Holy Beings were discussing among themselves, a strong wave of energy suddenly swept across from the training tower.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There was an explosion and then a huge hole appeared in the tower.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings turned around to look at the source of the deafening sound and the violent energy.</p>
