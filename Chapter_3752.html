  <p>
</p>

  <p>The greyish-brown substances could be ground into powder, which was called the Solid Lightning Powder.</p>

  <p>It was a kind of material that was formed after lightning was solidified, but the lightning's energy still remained in the powdered form.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked some powerful human warriors to collect the brown substances on the Heavenly Thunder Plain, and later he ground them into Solid Lightning Powder.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a considerable amount of Solid Lightning Powder could release an extremely terrifying amount of power.</p>

  <p>For instance, there was a time when a Divine Retribution Beast hunted down humans on Stage Thirty-three. The human warriors suffered many casualties, but when their lives were finally at stake, the Primeval Lord of Heaven threw a large amount of Solid Lightning Powder into the giant mouth of the Divine Retribution Beast.</p>

  <p>After that came an explosion, then the lightning bolts that erupted formed a large circular ball of lightning!</p>

  <p>It unleashed such a powerful force that even the Primeval Lord of Heaven himself was shocked. After all, they did collect those lightning bolts on the Heavenly Thunder Plain for several days, so it surely had a strong effect.</p>

  <p>When the attack badly mutilated the Divine Retribution Beast's head, the human warriors survived.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng didn't know where the Imprisoning Lightning came from, but he wouldn't let the opportunity pass, especially when the Magical Thunder Slave had shown up with a form.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>As he kneaded the greyish-brown substances with both of his hands, they quickly pulverized into powder and scattered all over the ground.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"You... You can't do this!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the Magical Thunder Slave roared continuously from the last section of the lightning bolt.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Moon Fire Slaves and the Chill Ice Slaves all had spiritual cores.</p>

  <p>Those spiritual cores were their life source, so they needed to conceal them well when they were in battle. If their spiritual cores were damaged, they would die.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Magical Thunder Slaves didn't have spiritual cores, because they didn't die easily with their special life forms.</p>

  <p>That was why the Magical Thunder Slave didn't expect Luo Zheng knew the way to kill him!</p>

  <p>Despite that, he refused to give up even in his death. He struggled and roared, and his cries pounded in Luo Zheng's ears like thunder.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he acted as if he didn't hear anything.</p>

  <p>He simply unleashed the Imprisoning Lightning and crushed the Magical Thunder Slave into powdery bits.</p>

  <p>When only the Magical Thunder Slave's last section remained, he transformed into a human face and begged for his life, but Luo Zheng didn't give him any chance.</p>

  <p>A purple beam of light flashed, then the human face became powder in Luo Zheng's fingers. "How?</p>

  <p>How did you kill a Magical Thunder Slave so easily?" Phoenix, who lay on the ice, uttered in disbelief.</p>

  <p>She used to work for the Element Spirit race, so she was familiar with the Magical Thunder Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves.</p>

  <p>The ever-changing Magical Thunder Slaves had left a deep impression on her. After all, they were powerful, indestructible, and immensely fast. They were almost perfect creatures that were born to fight.</p>

  <p>However, such a powerful being didn't survive for five minutes in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>This man?</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng didn't know what Phoenix was thinking. He stared attentively at the two Chill Ice Slaves nearby and asked, "What should we do now? Break in directly?"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he didn't know the situation in the ice castle. If no one guarded the ice castle like on Stage Twenty-eight, he would just charge straight in and head upwards to Stage Thirty-one.</p>

  <p>Even though Phoenix was weak now, her mind was still sharp. "Charge in!" she immediately ordered.</p>

  <p>According to her judgment, the Element Spirit race would place most of their forces in the first few ice castles while the last ice castle wouldn't be heavily guarded. However, it didn't matter much because Luo Zheng had already killed a Magical Thunder Slave.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pulled Phoenix up from the ground and said to Li Bianxue, "Follow me!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue nodded while the wings on Phoenix's back began to glow with a golden light. Despite her frail state, she could still control the divine flames of the Jin Wu to defend against attacks.</p>

  <p>The two Chill Ice Slaves that saw Luo Zheng kill the Magical Thunder Slave were also afraid of him now. When they found out that he was about to break into the ice castle, they had no choice but to defend despite their fear.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to move forward, however, the ice castle suddenly shook, and waves of reddish-brown soil burst forth from it!</p>

  <p>The mass of soil carried strong waves of energy as well.</p>

  <p>As soon as it was released, it quickly turned into multiple humans made of soil!</p>

  <p>"Burial Earth Slaves!" Phoenix exclaimed.</p>

  <p>These Burial Earth Slaves also belonged to Five-Element Slaves. Although they moved slowly, they had powerful defensive power. They were harder to kill than the Magical Thunder Slaves!</p>

  <p>Had they guarded the ice castle, then Luo Zheng and his company would have a difficult time breaking in.</p>

  <p>"No matter what kind of slave they are, we can only break in by force!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>With that, he gritted his teeth and rushed towards the ice castle!</p>

  <p>But when he was halfway, a blue beam of light flashed from the inside of the ice castle, and snow-white figures came out of it. They were Chill Ice Slaves, and there were probably more than a dozen of them!</p>

  <p>With so many Burial Earth Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves that surrounded the ice castle, it was almost impossible for Luo Zheng to break in by force.</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly, and his face turned grim.</p>

  <p>He and Li Bianxue were able to retreat from the Other Shore, but Phoenix would die there. Furthermore, the Element Spirit race would likely send more forces to guard the place after they left, and he would never expect to return to the Other Shore again.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom?"</p>

  <p>Deafening roars sounded from afar, and streaks of lightning chased after them.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Magical Thunder Slaves from the other ice castles immediately came after they got the news.</p>

  <p>Everything became worse now that they couldn't break into the ice castle, and an army of Magical Thunder Slaves surrounded them from behind.</p>

  <p>There was almost no way to escape!</p>

  <p>"Before the Soul Restraining Sand taints both of you? You'd better leave the Other Shore now?" Phoenix croaked.</p>

  <p>She also knew the consequence if Luo Zheng retreated from the Other Shore, but at least he could save his life. Besides, there was no other choice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly looked up and said, "No, there's another way..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, Phoenix and Li Bianxue immediately realized what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>He meant to flee back to the upper ice field!</p>

  <p>The ice cave they had just dug wasn't completely frozen yet, but there was a layer of ice pieces that had solidified. Nevertheless, they still had a chance to go up and escape.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The second Luo Zheng made his decision, he pulled Li Bianxue, hoisted Phoenix on his back, then flew upward!</p>

  <p>The two Chill Ice Slaves not far away saw that he wanted to escape, but they wouldn't let him get away so easily.</p>

  <p>They flapped their wings and quickly followed them!</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Phoenix snorted coldly.</p>

  <p>Her golden wings suddenly shook, then the blazing divine flames of the Jin Wu swept down like fire clouds and forced the two Chill Ice Slaves back.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In less than nine seconds, Luo Zheng finally entered the ice cave. As the golden flames burned inside it, the icicles all around it melted.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he went through the ice sheet and climbed up to the upper ice field. At the same time, Phoenix took out and ignited the Divine Fire Shield, which covered the top of their heads.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng held the Divine Fire Shield in one hand, pulled Li Bianxue with the other, and carried Phoenix on his back, he swiftly ran on the intensely cold upper ice field.</p>
