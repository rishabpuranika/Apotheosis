  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was only after a warrior entered the Soul Sea Realm that he would be repelled by the great world since, it was only during this time that a world would've formed inside his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm so he shouldn't be feeling the repelling force yet. Why had it come so early?</p>

  <p>Besides, hadn't he already fused with the world's will? Why was it rejecting him then?</p>

  <p>He wanted an answer to his questions but it wasn't something that the great world would be able to provide for him. Besides, the world's will was not born out of a singular being but of a collection of all living creatures. To question it was folly.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng tried as hard as he could to fight off the repelling force by culling his cultivation.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, his resistance consumed all his strength. "This is not right!" he muttered to himself in confusion.</p>

  <p>During his investigation of the four divine kingdoms and the Sea God Continent through the great world's will, Luo Zheng noticed that Amber and the other Soul Sea Realm masters had also felt the repelling force but were able to easily suppress it. In short, it didn't cause as much trouble to them as it did to Luo Zheng who wasn't even supposed to feel it in the first place!</p>

  <p>Ever since he broke through to the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm, the formless repelling force only grew stronger day by day. It almost grew exponentially.</p>

  <p>At first he was relaxed and comforted himself with the fact that he'd be able to resist it if he exerted enough effort.</p>

  <p>However, the following days proved him wrong.</p>

  <p>The second day was fine and he only felt a mild feeling of repellence. On the third day, however, the force was so strong that it completely distracted him from his cultivation.</p>

  <p>By the fourth day, his struggle was already very apparent from the bitter look on his face. As the days passed, Luo Zheng had to continually use more and more power to suppress the repelling force.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had noticed this sudden change in his behavior and was extremely worried thinking that he was unwell.</p>

  <p>However, this couldn't be possible since his level of cultivation rendered him immune to any kind of disease. There was no way that his suffering was brought on by some kind of ailment.</p>

  <p>When she asked him what was wrong, Luo Zheng tried to play it cool and assured her that he was okay.</p>

  <p>However, on the fifth day, Luo Zheng was unable to bear it anymore. He quickly gathered his three wives and told them the truth: that he was being repelled by the great world and would soon have to leave them for his inevitable ascension.</p>

  <p>The shock was clearly painted upon his three wives' beautiful faces.</p>

  <p>They knew for a fact that Luo Zheng would one day ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>It was his fate and they had long since accepted that a person as mighty as him was bound to go to a higher place. However, he was still at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm! Why was the great world taking him away from them so soon?</p>

  <p>They wanted to shout, to cry, to hold onto him for dear life but the suffering etched on their husband's face was too much for them to bear.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie felt particularly depressed once she accepted his imminent departure. She knew all good things had to end but she did not expect that it would be this soon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt even worse. He had merged with this great world's will and had become a sort of spokesperson for this plane. He did not know why this great world was kicking him out so early. Not even the cyan dragon could figure out why this had happened. It was extremely peculiar and also depressing on Zheng's part.</p>

  <p>In the end, the cyan dragon suggested that this might have something to do with the Primal Chaos Technique he practiced. The ascension of a warrior was actually related to the world within one's body. A warrior could only ascend after forming a world within his body, and what constituted the world within the body was a massive life vitality sea.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng hadn't formed a world within his body, what was inside Luo Zheng wasn't life vitality but chaotic energy!</p>

  <p>Maybe the cyan dragon was right. Zheng's practice of the Primal Chaos Technique had placed him in a completely different path that might have led to the great world forcibly rejecting him and caused an early ascension. Perhaps even if his master had been here, he couldn't explain it, either. The cyan dragon's conjecture kind of made sense.</p>

  <p>During the fifth day, Luo Zheng had no choice but to use one-third of his strength to suppress himself.</p>

  <p>On the sixth day, he resorted to using the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Only in this way would he be able to avoid being sent away to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>It was during this time that he knew he would not last long on this plane.</p>

  <p>Both Ning Yudie and Mu Ning had already stopped cultivating two days ago to spend more time with him. As they parted ways this time, they would never know when they would see each other again. Mu Ning continued to cling onto him all day long. She was very clear that she too would depart from the Central Region and enter the Apeiron Tower in the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to them, Mu Ning was faced with a dilemma: once she finished her cultivation in the Purple Power World, how would she ever find Luo Zheng in the Upper World? It was a place that she couldn't even fathom so finding Luo Zheng in the future worried her greatly.</p>

  <p>Resisting the repelling force was extremely difficult this time around and the dragon scales' powers were not inexhaustible. Luo Zheng had to activate the dragon scales in batches, switching out the ones that had dimmed down as he tried to prolong his stay here in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>By noon, Mu Ning came by and presented him with a ton of dishes.</p>

  <p>They had all gathered together in the Ice Palace and his three ladies all looked a bit sad at this probable last meal with him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wanted to say something, to leave some kind of reminder before he left. However, he didn't feel the need to do so. Ning Yudie was extremely strong and he knew nobody in Central Region could pose a threat to her.</p>

  <p>But he was afraid that she would accidentally break into the backside of the world, so he gently reminded her about that...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had held on as much as he could but it was while he was imparting his last few words that he realized that he could no longer suppress the repelling force.</p>

  <p>Once the power of the dragon scales disappeared, a bright, silver light wrapped around him. Luo Zheng forced a smile at Ning Yudie and the other two.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked as if she wanted to say something but the light was too bright and it hurt her to look at Luo Zheng anymore. Just as the brightness was getting too much, it suddenly shot up to the sky, taking Luo Zheng away from them.</p>

  <p>It had been nighttime and this brilliant streak of light was even brighter than lightning. The Cloudy City witnessed how the strongest warrior in Central Region ascended to the Upper World, leaving behind three beauties in his wake. Of course, people who had seen the bright light weren't aware that it had carried Luo Zheng away so all sorts of rumors circulated regarding this seemingly strange phenomena.</p>

  <p>The three girls were left alone in the empty hall, the feeling of emptiness settling in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was sad but she was evidently the calmest out of all of them.</p>

  <p>This strange sense of security stemmed from her faith and confidence that she would be able to meet Luo Zheng again soon enough.</p>

  <p>She turned to Ning Yudie, who looked sad. "What were you planning to say to Luo Zheng just now?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pursed her lips and lowered her head to look at the floor.</p>

  <p>"Nothing�"</p>

  <p>Her face immediately betrayed her. But since she didn't want to tell them, Mu Ning thought it best not to pry.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie stood up to leave but just as she did, she felt some kind of discomfort in her throat and she suddenly began to retch all over the floor.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that they realized what she was probably going to tell Luo Zheng earlier: she was pregnant!</p>

  <p>Actually, it had already been a few days since Ning Yudie found out. She wanted to tell Luo Zheng but she just didn't have the opportunity ever since she found out of his imminent ascension to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>It had been easy for her to suppress the urge to vomit in front of him, however, it wasn't recommended since nausea was a natural symptom for pregnant women. With him gone, Ning Yudie stopped hiding and thus vomited so suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell him?" Mu Ning asked.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie merely shook her head. "It wasn't the right time."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning shook her head but smiled. "It doesn't matter. I'll tell him when I meet him!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie stared at Mu Ning. "What do you mean?" she asked, feeling some sort of strangeness in her heart at Margaret's words.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Mu Ning said. "I'll be leaving Central Region tomorrow. I'm going to go straight to the Ethereal Spirit Sect and bid farewell to my great-grandfather and Brent!"</p>

  <p>"You're going to the Purple Power World?" Ning Yudie asked.</p>

  <p>Despite that Luo Zheng hadn't told her outright, Ning Yudie knew Luo Zheng wanted her to take care of both Mu Ning and Mu Ning in his stead considering that she was now the most powerful warrior in Central Region.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded. "Yes!" she said with a smug face. With Luo Zheng gone, Mu Ning returned to her original wilful manner.</p>

  <p>"I forbid you to leave," Ning Yudie ordered with a frown. She didn't expect this at all.</p>

  <p>But how could Mu Ning possibly listen to Ning Yudie? She let out a snort,</p>

  <p>"You have no right to stop me!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie knew this very well, of course she had no right to tell Mu Ning where she could go. However, there was a selfish reason behind Yudie's reaction.</p>

  <p>On the day of her wedding, she too had seen the old man from the Celestial Position speaking to Mu Ning. She assumed that their conversation had something to do with her Purple Power Body. Now that she had confirmed her suspicions, she was hesitant in letting Mu Ning leave. Ning Yudie knew that once Mu Ning entered the Purple Power World and cultivated, she would advance way faster than she ever could and be able to ascend to the Upper World sooner.</p>

  <p>The two bickered about this for a while, not noticing Mu Ning who had grown quiet beside them.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning knew that she was the weakest among the three of them which meant she would have to put in ten times the effort in order to catch up.</p>

  <p>It would be hard but her determination had soared towards new heights.</p>

  <p>She was dead-set in working hard to be able to ascend and see Luo Zheng again one day.</p>

  <p>What she didn't know was that, in the future, she would also have her own fortune.</p>
