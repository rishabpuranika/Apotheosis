<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4236 Spiders </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although it was the first time that Luo Nian entered the Deep Space, he had hunch that he could see this place clearly.</p>

  <p>He might have acquired this confidence when he entered the Abstruse Energy World. That was why he was not that surprised when he did see the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>Currently, he was in some circular secret room.</p>

  <p>On the walls of this secret room, several ancient patterns were vividly engraved. However, Luo Nian wasn't able to understand any of these words or markings.</p>

  <p>"He said to go right?"</p>

  <p>Remembering what Kincaid had told him, Luo Nian took a few steps forward and chose to walk along the right side of the passage. Upon treading this path, he saw the other end of the passage was broken. The other end had been downgraded to a fourth-grade space.</p>

  <p>As Kincaid was not sure if Luo Nian could move freely in the Deep Space, he asked him to walk in this fourth-grade space.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Nian knew about his ability, he believed he didn't need to choose this kind of broken road.</p>

  <p>He quickly withdrew from the right passage he was treading earlier and started walking straight towards the road ahead.</p>

  <p>This was a long and narrow pathway, and its surroundings were paved with transparent bricks. He noticed that each of these bricks was encircled by countless tiny rings that emitted bright lights, which illuminated the entire pathway.</p>

  <p>If the measurement of the third-grade world was to be followed, this passage would be about three thousand feet long. After a short while, he was finally able to reach its end.</p>

  <p>As he stepped out of the passage, a dazzling light welcomed him, making him feel a bit dizzy. Eventually, he was able to adapt to the light. Upon looking up, he was instantly shocked by the scene that appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>There was a huge golden circle floating in the sky, and it was the one responsible for projecting endless luminous lights in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Is this the sun here in the Deep Space?" The peculiar appearance of the scene greatly shocked Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Nian's cultivation base was not that high, his primary senses, and especially his vision and hearing had been significantly enhanced due to all his experiences over the years. It could be said that he was no longer inferior to the powerful masters in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Only half of the circular sun was still intact, while the other half was already broken. The scattered golden fragments had turned into ribbon-like objects that still released heat and light.</p>

  <p>"Only half of the sun has been downgraded. Is it because the power of the downgrader wasn't enough?" Luo Nian murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>After averting his gaze from the sun, Luo Nian continued to look straight ahead. Then, a huge wheel-shaped building appeared in his sight. He quickly noticed that he was at the edge of the wheel.</p>

  <p>Before coming to the Deep Space, Kincaid had a long talk with Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>From that, Luo Nian learned that this wheel-shaped building was called the Sky Wheel City by the Four Spirits Sect, and it was supposed to be the most magnificent building in all of the Deep Space. Most of the digging work by the Four Spirits Sect in the Deep Space was carried out around the Sky Wheel City.</p>

  <p>"The structure of that place is extremely complicated. We've attempted countless times, but we've never been close to the center of the Sky Wheel City. Once you get to the Deep Space, I urge you to set that place as your goal."</p>

  <p>This was what Kincaid told Luo Nian before he set out.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, I wonder if I could find that elder whose surname is Xue..."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian pursed his lips as he stared at the odd-looking building.</p>

  <p>Although he accepted this task willingly, he just realized that the information and tips given by the Human Spirit King were too little. Even if the Four Spirits Sect spent a long time in the Deep Space, it still wasn't enough for them to fully grasp the mystery of the place. As for Luo Nian, he could gain a better understanding of it once he saw and experienced the place.</p>

  <p>Still unsure of what he exactly needed to do, Luo Nian continued walking towards the center of the Sky Wheel City. While walking, he remembered that he was carrying the hopes of the human race, the human spirits, and the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>However, even though this was such a huge burden, he was actually very passionate about it.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was so happy that he became such an important figure.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Nian observed that dozens of huge paths branched out from the center of the Sky Wheel City and were connected to the outer edge of the wheel-shaped building. Seeing this, he just randomly walked through one of these paths.</p>

  <p>Since he entered the Sky Wheel City, Luo Nian had been very careful and on high alert. He was afraid that something strange would suddenly appear, so he needed to be vigilant.</p>

  <p>He clearly knew that even the vicious beasts in the chaos could defeat him. When he was in the Abstruse Energy World, he was also overwhelmed by the things that attacked him there. Thus, he was aware that the monsters of the Deep Space could only be stronger and more terrifying than the ones that he already encountered. If he wasn't careful enough, he might be killed on the spot.</p>

  <p>However, after walking for about an hour, the surroundings still remained quiet, especially on the huge and wide passages. He couldn't hear anything besides himself. Because of this, the fear in his mind and heart gradually dissipated, and he started walking more briskly.</p>

  <p>'Ziya can't even move an inch in the Abstruse Energy World. What would happen if he entered this world? I think it would be horrible if he was suddenly dragged into this world, ' Luo Nian thought to himself as he remembered what they went through before.</p>

  <p>However, even if he was able to move freely, it still took him more than two months to go up and down the pillar, even without the statues blocking his way.</p>

  <p>Rustle!</p>

  <p>As Luo Nian continued walking and was a bit lost in his thoughts, he suddenly heard a strange sound.</p>

  <p>It seemed like the sound of sand falling on a piece of board.</p>

  <p>He had already been quite relaxed for a while, but with this sound, he couldn't help but stop on his tracks and wear a suspicious look on his face.</p>

  <p>As he looked around, he found nothing.</p>

  <p>'Is it just my illusion?'</p>

  <p>Luo Nian shook his head and continued to walk forward, but he was now on high alert again.</p>

  <p>Then, he heard the rustling sound once more.</p>

  <p>This time, since he was already on guard, he heard the sound very clearly.</p>

  <p>He was able to pinpoint that the sound came from the back of the passage.</p>

  <p>However, the passage itself was hanging in the air, so he couldn't see what it looked like on the other side. Nervous at what might happen, he started rushing forward and didn't dare to look back.</p>

  <p>Rustle! Rustle!</p>

  <p>As Luo Nian ran faster, he also noticed that the speed of the rustling sound also increased.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the creature on the other side of the passage was following him all this time.</p>

  <p>As he heard this, fear easily crept beneath his skin and cast a shadow on his heart. He wasn't able to think clearly so he just continued to speed up.</p>

  <p>Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!</p>

  <p>As Luo Nian moved further, the rustling sound that he heard from the back of the passage became denser. He realized that at this point, more and more creatures must have joined in chasing him.</p>

  <p>After running for a few miles, the rustling sound was already getting closer and closer. For the first time, Luo Nian dared to look at the two sides of the passage. His face immediately turned ghastly pale at what he saw.</p>

  <p>Black sticks as thick as fingers appeared on both sides of the passage. It turned out that the rustling sound was caused by these black sticks rubbing the ground.</p>

  <p>On the other end of these black sticks, there were also some pie-shaped beings with sharp teeth embedded in them.</p>

  <p>"Are these... spiders?"</p>

  <p>The appearance of the creatures sent a strong shiver down his spine.</p>

  <p>These creatures were indeed very similar to spiders, but their legs were much thinner, and their bodies were also smaller. Their appearance was just so bizarre, making them look creepier and more alarming.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! The Human Spirit King lied to me!" Luo Nian couldn't help but shout in anxiousness.</p>

  <p>Kincaid spent four hours talking to him about the Deep Space, but not once did he mention the existence of these dreadful monsters.</p>

  <p>However, the truth was he couldn't blame Kincaid.</p>

  <p>The current situation in the Deep Space was very similar to that in the Abstruse Energy World. After an incomplete downgrading, the powerful beings that once ruled and lurked in the Deep Space had all perished. Of course, even the weakest creatures had also been eliminated.</p>

  <p>However, it was like a gradual evolution that happened through the passage of time. After more than a thousand chaotic eras, some deviant things slowly developed and appeared in the Deep Space that was supposed to be a lifeless land. These spider-like beings were one of them.</p>

  <p>Rustle!</p>

  <p>One of the spider-like creatures suddenly rushed towards Luo Nian, and its thin black leg swiftly stabbed towards him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Nian was agile enough to avoid the attack. But even before he could land on the ground, he suddenly felt a piercing pain in his chest. As he looked down, he saw that a thin black leg was protruding out of his chest. He was apparently stabbed from his back. Soon after, he felt that his body was being lifted up in the air.</p>
