<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The wild bone was plucked from the teenager's hand as Luo Zheng carefully studied it.</p>

  <p>Even though the beast bones were untouched by the chaotic energy in this barren place, there wasn't anything special about them.</p>

  <p>But the unique power in the wild bone was interesting.</p>

  <p>But then again, even though this young man and the humanoids didn't have advanced cultivation, they seemed unafraid of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Would they also be considered as extraordinary creatures? Or Out-of-Land Fiends?</p>

  <p>It wasn't the time to focus on that so Luo Zheng put away the bone. The teenager nimbly approached him. "Sir, since you can fly, can you take me away from here?"</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Zheng grabbed the teenager's hand and flew. He needed to know about this strange place.</p>

  <p>"Do you come here often to pick up wild bones?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"This place is too dangerous for you," Luo Zheng softly said.</p>

  <p>Even if the crawling humanoids were like ants to Luo Zheng, they could still easily kill this teenager.</p>

  <p>It seemed like such a waste to get himself killed just to pick up wild bones.</p>

  <p>The teenager faintly smiled. "I was careless this time and went too deep in the Immemorial Wilderness. I used to only pick up bones at the edge.</p>

  <p>But now more and more people come to pick up wild bones so I had to go deeper and try my luck!"</p>

  <p>'So this place is called the Immemorial Wilderness...' Luo Zheng thought to himself. Out loud, what he said was, "There're many other people who get wild bones like you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course! The wild bones are what we use to live on," the teenager replied without hesitation.</p>

  <p>When he followed the gist of the teenager's words, Luo Zheng understood the general idea of the situation.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the Immemorial Wilderness was a tribe and the teenager was a member.</p>

  <p>The people absorbed the power within the wild bones to become strong.</p>

  <p>The teenager had the same goal.</p>

  <p>Even if the Immemorial Wilderness was vast, its edge had been searched for countless years and the wild bones were considerably hard to find there.</p>

  <p>It was a great risk for the teenager to go deeper into the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, the teenager couldn't have gotten far at all because of the strength of his legs.</p>

  <p>The teenager instructed Luo Zheng to fly forth in the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the white of the wild bones was replaced by the dark soil of the edge.</p>

  <p>There were fewer Wights in the outer corners of the Immemorial Wilderness just like the teenager said.</p>

  <p>There were some humans digging through the bones in search of wild bones.</p>

  <p>They flew for a bit more and finally exited the Immemorial Wilderness, greeted by a medium sized tribe.</p>

  <p>"Here we are!" A sly light was in the teenager's eyes as he pointed at the tribe. "Sir, let's go down first!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng accepted the teenager's suggestion.</p>

  <p>It was too eye-catching if they flew into the tribe when the people here didn't know how to fly.</p>

  <p>He must be more careful in this strange environment.</p>

  <p>The Out-of-Land Fiends at the bottom of the chaos could bind the entire divine land. The true strongest at the bottom of the chaos was probably stronger than a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"Now that you're here, please come to my tribe and be my guest," the teenager said sincerely.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly and followed the teenager into the tribe.</p>

  <p>Just as they crossed the mountain top and approached the entrance of the tribe, a large group of burly men unexpectedly rushed out.</p>

  <p>Their hands were laden with sticks, iron forks, and stones, as aggressively they rushed towards Luo Zheng and the teenager.</p>

  <p>"Bane! How dare you come back?"</p>

  <p>"As I said, you, a bane, are forever not allowed to return!"</p>

  <p>"Don't defend yourself. Get out!"</p>

  <p>None of them even glanced at Luo Zheng; their target was the teenager.</p>

  <p>With loud curses, the people rushed at them.</p>

  <p>Some of those who came near held the sticks and iron forks, while others stayed back to throw huge stones at them.</p>

  <p>"Help! Sir, these people are trying to kill me!" The teenager's whole body trembled as he hid behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The act would have been perfect. From the teenager's expression and voice to his actions, it would be hard to deny that he was terrified if it wasn't for the lack of fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was hard to feign innocence and he obviously wanted to make use of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The teenager asked Luo Zheng to land earlier so that the people wouldn't know he could fly. That was why they dared to rush forward fearlessly.</p>

  <p>It made Luo Zheng unhappy enough to frown.</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't particularly like it, Luo Zheng gently raised his hand and had wisps of invisible strength source condense in front of the people approaching.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>All the stones aimed at them turned into powdered dust.</p>

  <p>The sticks and iron forks in the people's hands disappeared from their hold.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you're so powerful! They always bully me. Teach them a lesson!"</p>

  <p>The fake fear on the teenager's face completely disappeared and was replaced with excitement.</p>

  <p>In just a moment, the expression of the people changed.</p>

  <p>It wasn't within their expectation for a stranger to be so powerful and help the teenager.</p>

  <p>"Who... Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you helping this bane?" a man with cropped hair asked as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied calmly, "I don't plan on helping him but you can talk calmly.</p>

  <p>There's no need to do this to a child."</p>

  <p>It didn't have anything to do with him and Luo Zheng didn't like being used.</p>

  <p>"A child?" The man laughed coldly. "Ever since he came to our tribe, misfortunes occurred every year. He's not a child but a living bane. He always brings bad luck!"</p>

  <p>"Sir, this is our own issue," another person said.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a bane!" The teenager forced his chin up despite the sadness in his face as he defended himself. "Zelda can prove it!"</p>

  <p>"Humph! If Zelda didn't take you in out of kindness, we wouldn't have ended up like this. You can't go home!" the man with cropped hair said firmly.</p>

  <p>From within the tribe, a woman slowly walked over and spoke in a cold, sweet voice, "Since you don't let Luther return home, I'll leave the tribe with him."</p>
