<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2649 Chaotic Battle </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zelda and Luther came back to the center of the group, protected by the others encircling them.</p>

  <p>After all, they were the two most important people here. They needed the extra protection, for the Warden race might take them as their first targets.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was walking in the front of the group, narrowed his eyes and asked, "What if we're determined to pass through?"</p>

  <p>The man wearing a black robe raised his hand gently, and all the butterflies surrounding him began to flutter violently, forming a pair of wings and floating behind the man. "The ball is still in your court. This is your last chance. Leave Luther and Zelda behind or you will all die!"</p>

  <p>"There's no way!" Zelda's voice was heard ringing out from the back.</p>

  <p>The others didn't utter a single word. They knew that by coming this far, retreating wasn't an option.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" The man in the black robe sneered and waved his hand, with more intensity this time. He slowly removed the black robe attached to his body and revealed his looks.</p>

  <p>Beneath the robe was a strong young man with a shockingly obvious scar on his nose.</p>

  <p>As the young man removed his cloak, the other men on the roofs, equally in black robes, took theirs off too. For the Warden race, this was their battle signal.</p>

  <p>"Seeing as you aren't seizing your final chance, you'll just have to die along with these two miserable people."</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the butterflies behind the young man fluttered in disorder, rushing directly at the group in a giant wave.</p>

  <p>"You're dealing with the enemies on both sides!"</p>

  <p>At that, Zheng took the group's lead in charging the group forward.</p>

  <p>These men in black robes all had blue energy, which was gifted to them by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>According to what Zelda had said, everyone would receive different benefits from the Chaos Ancient God. Now, it seemed that the dense clutter of butterflies in front of them were their greatest threat. Moreover, it was impossible for them to get too close and therefore, Zheng took it upon himself to make the first move!</p>

  <p>"Shoot!"</p>

  <p>Emily ordered as she focused her attention.</p>

  <p>The exiles pointed their bows and arrows at the warriors standing on both sides of the path. In seconds, they were ready to shoot them.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>As the arrows shot out one after the next, the Warden race's warriors all lowered their bodies at once.</p>

  <p>With a series of deafening thuds, the arrows hit the roof tiles viciously.</p>

  <p>"There's no way we're retreating! If we don't fight, we'll die. Come on!</p>

  <p>Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Emily said in a clear, confident voice.</p>

  <p>Of course, she knew that most of the Wild Gods and even a few of the exiles were feeling scared. It was up to her to motivate them.</p>

  <p>The members of the Warden race fought desperately, while Emily's group had the only goal of escaping this world as soon as they could.</p>

  <p>This contradiction, however, simply couldn't be reconciled. In the current moment, no one had any other choice but to give the battle everything they had and go all out.</p>

  <p>All Emily could truly do was to encourage them to fight, even if this meant risking their lives.</p>

  <p>As she called out to the group she led, Emily lifted the annular saber, stepped gently on the ground with her tiptoe, and made a leap onto a roof with an extremely beautiful posture.</p>

  <p>Emily had been shot in the collarbone before, but her injury wasn't serious.</p>

  <p>As she faced the Warden race straight on, she dared not to take them carelessly. She could only lead the other warriors to fight together alongside her!</p>

  <p>"Master Emily is right! There is no way to retreat now! We should follow her!" a Wild God from the Snake Goddess race said loudly, following Emily onto the roof.</p>

  <p>The moment the Wild God had reached the top, a man in a black robe sneered and gently clasped his hands together. The blue light appeared immediately, and a huge axe came into view out of nowhere. The weapon slashed down toward her head.</p>

  <p>"Die!" the cloaked man yelled.</p>

  <p>Puff...</p>

  <p>The axe formed by the blue energy was nearly invincible. One thing for certain, the weapon was absolutely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Besides, now the Wild God was nothing more than an ordinary person.</p>

  <p>Without any time to react, she was sliced in half, blood splattering all over the ground.</p>

  <p>"Claudia!"</p>

  <p>As they watched the scene from a distance, the members of the Snake Goddess race were stunned silent. When they realized what had happened, they were immediately overwhelmed with grief.</p>

  <p>"Kill them!" a warrior hurled.</p>

  <p>"Let's fight!</p>

  <p>Let's fight with them..." another called out.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Snake Goddess race quickly became sad and indignant.</p>

  <p>As for the others, although they had earlier shown their timidity, after seeing Claudia's miserable state, they finally understood what "no going back" actually meant!</p>

  <p>The only way to survive this battle now was to risk their own lives and fight for the good of their entire race.</p>

  <p>They were in a dangerous situation. They felt as though they were standing on a single-log bridge and below them was an infinite abyss.</p>

  <p>Crossing over the abyss was only possible once their enemies had been killed.</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>More people precipitated to the roof tops, climbing fiercely up both sides.</p>

  <p>The sound of arrows shooting and whizzing through the air could be heard, and rays of blue light began shining from the roofs.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>Within seconds, countless butterflies flew upward, like flowers sprouting high into the skies.</p>

  <p>A strapping man from the Warden race raised his hands and they suddenly turned into sharp claws. He pointed them directly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, all the butterflies transformed into a huge cage and shot toward Zheng at once. Their only objective was to envelop him.</p>

  <p>Zheng was running at an extremely fast speed. Just as the cage was about to trap him, he suddenly changed directions with a few very awkward steps.</p>

  <p>His entire body nearly leaned straight into the ground.</p>

  <p>Using his waist's strength, he only staggered a little before steadying himself. As he did so, Zheng succeeded in completely avoiding the cage.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The long sword shook slightly in Zheng's hand before he stabbed it toward the strapping man before him.</p>

  <p>The man was taken aback with surprise. No one would have guessed that Zheng was so flexible.</p>

  <p>That said, the man had no intentions of retreating before Zheng. The butterflies that had turned into a cage quickly transformed once again, but this time, into a curtain in order to block the man from the front all while moving toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing the curtain made of the butterflies, Zheng felt that he suddenly had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>He moved a few steps horizontally, trying to find a gap in order to get closer to the butterflies. However, the butterflies were incredibly nimble.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had finally found a little space and tried to attack, the butterflies moved and protected the man instead.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to attack eight times in a row and circled around the strapping man three times. Several times, when his long sword was only a foot away from the strapping man, the butterflies surged over at the last second. Alas, Zheng decided he had no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>"Is that your only skill?"</p>

  <p>The strapping man grinned coldly. At that, he flicked his fingers and the blue butterflies flew around him in disorder. They began to spread in all directions!</p>

  <p>If only the butterflies could maintain a certain rule or pattern... At least then Zheng could easily avoid them.</p>

  <p>Now that all the butterflies were moving in an irregular way though, it was much too difficult for Zheng to dodge. He could only move cautiously among them. He had to be very carefully when doing so because the winged insects were in fact very dangerous.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Zheng couldn't use the Eight Smoky Melodies in his current situation. If he could use it, then these butterflies wouldn't be capable of touching him at all, not even if he closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Zheng kept moving backward, all while the strapping man manipulated the butterflies to continue approaching him.</p>

  <p>Constantly dodging, Zheng suddenly felt a sharp pain run up his right leg.</p>

  <p>A blue butterfly had skimmed across his outer leg, leaving a mark as thick as a thumb.</p>

  <p>Due to his injury, Zheng began to move more slowly, and countless butterflies gathered around him.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" the strapping man shouted at Zheng in a ferocious voice.</p>

  <p>From Zheng's point of view, he could only expect to be bitten and seriously injured by these raging butterflies within the next three seconds.</p>
