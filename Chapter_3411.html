<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone was on their guard; they were wary not only of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, but also of the huge eye.</p>

  <p>As they had felt the force of fear in the cave that contained many sculptures before, they assumed that it would be waiting for them in the main peak.</p>

  <p>They had been well-prepared and already known what to expect, but they were still dumbfounded when the huge eye came into their view.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Every creature from all of the races retreated at the sight that greeted them.</p>

  <p>The warriors that had hidden in the arrays before had been disheartened at their own weakness. The moment they saw the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits, they immediately fled for their lives.</p>

  <p>They turned back to the direction they came from and flew directly towards the nearest magic arrays.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have forced us out, you can't turn your backs on us!"</p>

  <p>A flash of red light came from the huge eye, and suddenly, a circle of blood lines radiated out from it at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>When everyone felt the blood lines sweep over their skin, their hearts skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>The blood lines had already spread out over an area with a radius of a hundred thousand feet in the time it took them to blink.</p>

  <p>The magic array closest to them was right outside the perimeter of the blood lines. A few individuals braced themselves and rushed towards the magic array.</p>

  <p>This particular array was set up by several powerful masters. They believed that as long as they hid within it, it would protect them.</p>

  <p>But even a slight contact of their fingers with the blood lines sent a sensation similar to an electric shock through their bodies.</p>

  <p>They felt the force of fear spike within their hearts, triggering their psychological flaws. Those with weak constitutions lost their minds; some cried out helplessly in an attempt to vent their emotions. In the end, they had no choice but to leave the blood lines.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's group saw the blood lines, their eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>They realized that the huge eye had limited everyone's movement, and essentially trapped all of them.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the Chaotic Source Spirits and the giant eye were very complacent regarding their own strength, and they had no doubt that they would be able to kill everyone.</p>

  <p>After the main peak had collapsed, the Evil God had been wandering around as if he didn't have a care in the world.</p>

  <p>When the huge eye and the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits showed up, his interest was piqued greatly.</p>

  <p>The problem was, he was far away from them. The blood lines had not been able to reach his location, so he approached the very edge of the blood lines' territory.</p>

  <p>"The giant eye's force of fear is extremely terrifying, but it won't last long."</p>

  <p>The Evil God fixed his gaze on the blood lines below him; he strode towards them with something like excitement and curiosity mixed together.</p>

  <p>The moment he came in contact with the blood lines, the force of fear shot straight into his heart.</p>

  <p>His face scrunched into a frown and his eyes flashed with an unusual color.</p>

  <p>He braced himself against the force of fear and endured its attacks. He walked over them with a sense of realization.</p>

  <p>"It's just as I expected." The Evil God raised the corners of his mouth slightly, with a look as if he had everything in full control. "The stronger the Other Shore Tokens are, the weaker their own strength is. You are too confident in your power."</p>

  <p>The Evil God was not one to be easily fazed. He had wanted to make his move back in the cave of the main peak, but he was hindered by the force of fear.</p>

  <p>It was from that moment that he became determined to find out whatever being was controlling the force of fear.</p>

  <p>After the main peak was cut off and the huge eye forcibly materialized, the Evil God was determined to not let it go.</p>

  <p>He knew his analysis and evaluation were correct.</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore Tokens provided people with abilities they didn't previously have, and some of them were extraordinary. As an example, the mysterious type of Other Shore Tokens provided abilities that their opponents couldn't guard against. Some, like the Eye of Will and the Heart of Accomplice, had extraordinary abilities, but their Other Shore Power was actually extremely weak.</p>

  <p>The huge eye had the ability of the Malicious Stare. It was terrifying, but it clearly was not powerful.</p>

  <p>When the warriors outside of the Chaotic Source World saw that their clansmen were trapped, they were in an uproar.</p>

  <p>"Why did an Eye of Will appear in the Chaotic Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Pear Hill, please give us an explanation!"</p>

  <p>"Open the Chaotic Source World and let us go inside!"</p>

  <p>The younger generation were more reckless than the leaders of the super forces, their lack of experience lending them a false bravado.</p>

  <p>It was extremely rare for the Dreaded Eye Demons to be seen on the Other Shore, but it wasn't a mystery where they came from. After all, they used to be one of the ruling civilizations.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had rushed out of the mountain, together with the Eye of Will. The younger generation couldn't resist them, no matter how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>Athemar's and Winchell's expressions had become grim.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill was the one in charge of monitoring the Chaotic Source World. Was the Pear Hill aware of what was happening? If they were, why did they permit them to go inside?</p>

  <p>More importantly, Other Shore Tokens only existed in the Source World when they were carried by creatures in their inner worlds. The only exception had been the Chaotic Source Spirits with a special form.</p>

  <p>So, how did the huge eye appear in the Source World like the Chaotic Source Spirits? This had defied all notions of common sense.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth spread her wings majestically and launched towards the gate leading to the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>A tongue of flame curled upwards and released a scorching aura. Coldly, Elizabeth said, "Let me through."</p>

  <p>The Divine Lair had a huge loss in the recent events, so Elizabeth wanted to make sure that her other clansmen had a chance to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The women of the Pear Hill who had been guarding the gate leered at Elizabeth coldly. One of them told her, "Aside from the young warriors who have been given tickets, we cannot allow anyone else to enter the Chaotic Source World."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth frowned unhappily and answered back, "Something unexpected has happened inside. If we do not intervene, all of them will die!"</p>

  <p>"This is not the first time that a large number of young people die in there; it often happens through the ages," the woman replied. "Our Pear Hill did not establish these rules alone. Emperor Charm of your race also contributed to it. If you try to get past us by force, don't blame us if we use force to restrain you!"</p>

  <p>"You..." Elizabeth gave the woman her fiercest glare, but she wasn't able to retort.</p>

  <p>Although she thought that the guards weren't seriously threatening, it would really be troublesome for her if she attacked the people from Pear Hill in the Icy Snow Province. She had no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>The other leaders of the super forces weren't able to do anything either.</p>

  <p>They could only place their best hopes on their clansmen, praying that they could survive their encounter with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and complete the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.</p>

  <p>On the top of the snowy mountain, Fuxi was settled on the snow, giving no mind to the interior of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>He gazed far into the distance, skimming over the Chaotic Source World, and stopped at the boundary of the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>A thin space crack was slowly enlarging there.</p>

  <p>Several sharp claws insidiously extended from inside the space crack. A small bloody eye was on top of them.</p>

  <p>The creature inside the space crack was very good at hiding itself. Even if the space had been torn apart, its aura was undetectable, as if it could perfectly merge with the space.</p>

  <p>"Such a hiding theurgy is truly extraordinary. If I hadn't used the Eight Diagrams disk for calculation, I wouldn't have detected this," Fuxi muttered silently. "Let me see what your intentions are."</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill had not been able to see the changes within the Chaotic Source World in the beginning.</p>

  <p>It was not until what had happened in the Chaotic Source Sea that Fuxi had used the Eight Diagrams disk for his calculations and found out the truth.</p>

  <p>He had also incidentally discovered the Eye of Will in the main peak of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>The Eye of Will was an Other Shore Token, and as such, people of the Pear Hill knew that it should not have existed in the Source World without a carrier.</p>

  <p>If it was true that the Other Shore Tokens could exist in the chaos without carriers, it would mean trouble for the entire Source World. It seemed that the situation in the chaos was about to change phenomenally.</p>
