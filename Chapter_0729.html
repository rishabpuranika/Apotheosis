<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When they heard Luo Zheng challenge Eden, the cultivators in the grandstand were stupefied.</p>

  <p>Zheng's performance had been amazing in his first two battles.</p>

  <p>Body refining technique, Fire Law...he had stunned all with his extraordinary skills.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to believe that a guy at the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm could possess such powerful abilities.</p>

  <p>However, it had happened. Luo Zheng had not only defeated Alex from the Gongsun Clan, but he had also beaten Brody from Bloodwood Cliff. He won every battle in which he had fought, and so, the spectators were convinced that it was not luck that had helped him to win. Luo Zheng had proved to all that his strength was enough for him to challenge cultivators at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Whether they were willing to admit it or not, that was the truth.</p>

  <p>"I acknowledge that Luo Zheng is amazing. He's challenging a cultivator at the Internal Elixir level although he is at the Illuminating Soul Realm. I don't know how many years it has been since such thing last happened.</p>

  <p>Regardless, he is bold to challenge Eden."</p>

  <p>"He's courting death. But he's dead or not, that's not our concern."</p>

  <p>"Eden didn't display his real strength in the battle just now, but he still crushed Benson from Cloud Hall! But Luo Zheng? He's probably a joke to Eden."</p>

  <p>The eyes of many disciples from Cloud Hall lit up when they heard Zheng's challenge.</p>

  <p>Benson was the strongest among the Internal Elixir Realm disciples of Cloud Hall. He was at par with Blake. But not long after he entered into battle, he was severely injured by Eden. Had Benson not admitted defeat, Eden would have killed him! All the Cloud Hall disciples felt angry about this.</p>

  <p>However, there was no use in getting angry, as only the strong survived in the martial arts world. The weak cultivators would only be stomped on by the strong ones.</p>

  <p>Benson took a pill, which was used for treating injuries. When he heard Luo Zheng issue a challenge to Eden, a hint of worry flickered in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Could Luo Zheng be Eden's match and defeat him?</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie glanced at Luo Zheng, who stood beside her, and asked after a little hesitation, "You…. are you confident that you will defeat him?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to look at Ning Yudie. He said with a confident smile, "Why shouldn't I be?"</p>

  <p>Seeing his smile, Ning Yudie felt warmth flood her heart. Her heart suddenly beat faster. Luo Zheng looked all the more attractive with confidence glowing on his face.</p>

  <p>Even when facing an opponent as strong as Eden, Luo Zheng didn't have the slightest trace of fear.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng left the high platform, Ning Yudie said blandly, "Maybe you can kill Marilyn. If Eddie makes a move, I will do my best to help you."</p>

  <p>In the grandstand, Lewis' mouth was wide open as he stared at Luo Zheng who had just stepped into the arena. After a long while, he muttered in a hoarse voice, "He... he wants to challenge Eden."</p>

  <p>Patrick calmly replied, "It would be strange if he didn't."</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded in agreement. Luo Zheng had performed too many miracles. Back in Cloud Sect, who could have imagined that he would be able to get the first place?</p>

  <p>Tianming walked toward the area where cultivators bet on the outcome of matches.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Lewis flew forward like a gust of wind and stood in Tianming's way.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet all the money we have earned on Luo Zheng," Tianming said indifferently.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng defeated Brody, everyone had been surprised. Tianming and Lewis made plenty of money from that single gamble.</p>

  <p>"All of it? No. At least return the capital to me!" Lewis pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!" Tianming ignored Lewis' request.</p>

  <p>"No!" Lewis straightened up and stood firmly in front of Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Out of the way!"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a flash, Tianming pressed his shining longsword against Lewis's neck.</p>

  <p>Lewis had no choice but to back away.</p>

  <p>If Zheng's chances of winning were based only on his strength, Tianming was unsure whether he would be able to win against Eden. However, Tianming knew that Luo Zheng would never do something without being certain that he would be victorious. No matter how disadvantageous the situation might seem to be for him, Luo Zheng would bring everything under his control in the end.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Tianming wanted to gamble on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Due to the huge gap in strength levels between Luo Zheng and Eden, the odds offered by the banker were shockingly high. Of course, most cultivators bet on Eden.</p>

  <p>Although these cultivators didn't like Eden, they couldn't deny that he was powerful. If they had bet on Luo Zheng, it would be like throwing their life vitality crystals into the river.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng briskly walked into the arena and glanced at Eden. Before he could say anything, Eden began to speak, "I admire your courage," Eden said with a smile. "However, courage comes from the strength one has. You're not strong enough. Yet, you dared to challenge me. This can't be considered as courage. This is recklessness."</p>

  <p>Hearing Eden's words, Luo Zheng said calmly, "I can see that you're very confident, but your confidence isn't backed by strength. You are conceited!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, Eden's face hardened at Zheng's verbal attack. Then he sneered, "Interesting! You are a funny man. Even at a time like this, you dare to talk back. I wonder if you have the power to defeat me or you are just bluffing."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter to me what you think. If it pleases you, you can think that I'm bluffing," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Then let me see how long you can hold out," Eden said as he drew his sword from its sheath. It was a simple and unadorned saber— it looked very ordinary.</p>

  <p>"It's the Nameless Saber! It's Eddie's saber! A sacred weapon!"</p>

  <p>"This Nameless Saber has accompanied Eddie to every battle he joined in the Central Region. I never thought that he would pass it to his son!"</p>

  <p>"If Zheng's body protection garment didn't exist, this Nameless Saber would be considered as one of the best sacred weapons in the Central Region."</p>

  <p>Eden pulled out the Nameless Saber and swung it. Countless small waves were produced with this gentle movement. It almost appeared as if the saber could merge with the air.</p>

  <p>"This time, there won't be any mistakes. Benson from Cloud Hall narrowly escaped in the last battle. I won't give you the chance to admit defeat." After finishing speaking, a foot-long wind blade appeared beside Eden. In the next instant, several wind blades encased Eden.</p>

  <p>Eden's wind blades looked strange. There were faint rays of silver light at the edge of the wind blades, making the invisible wind blades look all the more powerful as if they were plated with a silver blade.</p>

  <p>'Hmm? Is this the second type of Law Power? That is Metal Law!' Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows as he studied Eden's wind blades. 'Did he combine the two types of laws?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon snorted coldly. "Combine? No! He just cleverly connected the two laws. You can also do the same! Do you think it that easy to combine different laws? I'm afraid no one is capable of combining different laws in the human world!"</p>

  <p>"Connecting two Laws... this is a good idea," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng had the cyan dragon that helped him to understand the opponent's tactics, he didn't care too much about Eden's employment of two types of Law Powers. But those warriors were different. They only saw the surface of the thing.</p>

  <p>"Look! It's the Metal Law! Eden actually comprehended 70% of the Metal Law. No, it should be more than 80%!"</p>

  <p>"He's able to comprehend two types of laws when he is at the Internal Elixir Realm. He must be a freak! It's unimaginable."</p>

  <p>"Is this the fusion of laws? This is the first time I've seen someone using two types of laws simultaneously! Even if Luo Zheng has mastered Fire Law completely, I'm afraid he still wouldn't be able to block Eden's attack!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly when he heard the chatter among the disciples. Wind began rising from his side as well.</p>

  <p>At the same time, beams of golden light swirled around him. Each time a wind blade was formed, it would merge with a golden light.</p>

  <p>After a while, golden wind blades started dancing around Luo Zheng. Zheng's wind blades looked fuller and more energetic than Eden's wind blades. And the golden light emitted from Zheng's wind blades was brighter than Eden's silver lights! Luo Zheng said to the cyan dragon in his mind, "It is just as you said. I can do it too. This is not an infusion of laws. It is simply embedding two powers into each other. However, the power combined seems to be a lot stronger."</p>

  <p>Most of the cultivators present had no idea what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't Luo Zheng practice cultivation methods with fire attribute?"</p>

  <p>"Can anyone explain what is happening? Why does Zheng's method look so similar to Eden's wind blades? Is he copying him?"</p>

  <p>"Although I don't really believe it either... let me tell you, what's floating on Zheng's body is the complete power of the Wind Law and the full power of the Metal Law!"</p>

  <p>The vast majority of cultivators fell silent when they heard this.</p>

  <p>The complete Fire Law, the complete Wind Law, and the complete Metal Law…</p>

  <p>How did Luo Zheng do it?</p>

  <p>"Can anyone tell me how he managed to comprehend so much Law Power?</p>

  <p>And each of the laws is intact!" Just when everyone was silent, a loud shout came out from the crowd. The voice pierced through the air and reverberated in all cultivators' ears.</p>
