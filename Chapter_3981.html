<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits were already consumed with suspicions about the entire situation.</p>

  <p>After all, the Element Spirit Civilization was prepared to reward them handsomely if they were to capture Zheng and his companions. The weakest of them were still at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Even if they attacked Zheng and his group without a warning, they were capable enough to defend themselves. But surprisingly, they were quickly killed without putting up a decent fight.</p>

  <p>"What just happened?" The bull-headed man with golden horns asked, with his eyes overflowing with confusion.</p>

  <p>The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit shook the Endless Corridor in her palm slightly. At this action, a corpse in a twisted condition was thrown out of it. With her ocean-like eyes reflecting her determination, she spread her transparent wings evenly and prepared to take flight. Her body ascended to the air with the blue light in her eyes shining in contrast to her hair.</p>

  <p>As she flapped her wings, the immense power generating in the space around her spread around like an invisible tidal wave.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the power of space spread was not fast, but it had enough momentum to cover a significantly large area.</p>

  <p>Moreover, nothing within its scope could deceive it or remain hidden. It was much better than the spiritual sense when used for detecting.</p>

  <p>The time ticked away, one second followed by the other without any progress.</p>

  <p>As a result, the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit felt her nerves tense up in confusion. They were supposed to find the Heavenly Eye Vine on the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, but it was nowhere to be seen. How could this be?</p>

  <p>"Stop looking for it. It has gone to the second stair," the golden horned bull-headed man said suddenly after noticing the intensity of her predicament.</p>

  <p>"How can you be so sure?" the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit questioned him. But as soon as she turned around to face him, she was left speechless.</p>

  <p>Her eyes instinctively fell on the ice piece in the hands of the golden horned bull-headed man. The ice piece was given by the Element Spirit Civilization. As of now, Zheng and his companions were being closely pursued by the Shadow Warriors. They could easily track Zheng and his group to know their whereabouts using the ice piece.</p>

  <p>The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit averted her eyes and lowered them to the ground to avoid contact as she felt flustered. She put too much faith in her talent for manipulating space. Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine Zheng and his group would play a trick on her right under her nose.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After experiencing a setback, she kept spiraling up until she reached a height of more than ten thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Each stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau was over ten thousand feet high. At her height, she was able to see the second stair.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a flash of intense blue light sparkling in her eyes, she said in a low voice resembling a whisper, "It runs very fast."</p>

  <p>As if responding to her gesture, a long, yet thin space corridor shot forward at an untraceable speed. She grabbed the end of the space corridor securely in her hand and dragged it down with force, forging a right-angled space corridor.</p>

  <p>This space corridor held the potential to teleport everyone. The killing intent in her eyes raged like flames that refused to be put out. A hefty price would have to be paid for fooling her.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the second stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, the Heavenly Eye Vine was twisting, and turning its flexible body like that of a snake. Its movements were astonishingly agile on the plateau.</p>

  <p>Sawyer was holding a small object in his hands. It was the Heavenly Eye Vine, but it was dozens of times smaller than its original size. The sizes of Zheng, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others were also reduced in proportion.</p>

  <p>"How pathetic!" Fuxi's eyes twitched as he stared at his substitute.</p>

  <p>Although he knew it was a fake, he couldn't help but feel a tinge of sadness while watching its body being torn up limb from limb.</p>

  <p>"Wow, you really live up to your reputation as Eternal Realm Hunters. Your skills are so ingenious and amazing," King Ieuan praised in an awestruck tone.</p>

  <p>"I'm flattered. We've been staying in the Grand Pure Realm for a long time, so we're quite familiar with this place," Sawyer said with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunters did not join any force and had been wandering around in the Grand Pure Realm. The Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization were in constant search for them. In addition to that, they had to deal with a large number of creatures from other races trying to locate their whereabouts to capture them.</p>

  <p>To be able to survive under such hostile circumstances, they had to toughen themselves up naturally.</p>

  <p>Just now when they were attacked, Sawyer made quick speculation about the attackers being the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits.</p>

  <p>The basis of his judgment was the fact that only the Space Manipulating Spirits harnessed the expertise required to be able to throw those axes over with such accuracy.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Sawyer accurately pinpointed the position of bull-headed men and Space Manipulating Spirits. He also had a clear idea of their plans to ambush them ahead.</p>

  <p>Thinking quick on his feet to avoid the awaiting calamity, he used a treasure that was discovered in the Supreme Pure Realm. It was a type of white soil that could morph into anything and imitate things perfectly. It was still debatable whether it was alive or not. Nevertheless, it could duplicate everything perfectly.</p>

  <p>The white mud was quite a popular Other Shore Token in the Supreme Pure Realm. The Eternal Realm warriors that carried it could transform into any form at will.</p>

  <p>Just as Sawyer used the white mud, Thurston took out another treasure. It was a round mirror that was barely visible to the naked eye and harnessed a remarkably powerful hiding effect.</p>

  <p>After the white mud transformed into their shapes, Thurston covered them with the round mirror. Their perfect cooperation formed substitutes that were impossible to tell apart from the original.</p>

  <p>Their commendable skills earned them the respect of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess along with the others.</p>

  <p>Putting their survival experience into practice, they were able to evade two fatal attempts of assassination aimed towards them. One was when they were chased by an Other Shore race in the Grand Pure Realm, and the other was when they were hunted down by the Nihility race. Each time they emerged victorious when it came to fooling the enemy and derailing their plans to capture them.</p>

  <p>But this time, there was an enormous loophole left unnoticed in their skills.</p>

  <p>The Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men were at a safe distance from them, which was why they were unable to notice their presence, but the two Shadow Warriors floating in the air still kept a close watch on the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>When Zheng pointed out the loophole, Sawyer diffused his concerns with a slight wave of his hand. They could only hope that the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men would not use the ice piece of the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, Sawyer's judgment was right on the money.</p>

  <p>"If they find out these are fakes, they will try their best to catch up. We're not out of the woods yet," the Snake Goddess said with a grim expression on her face.</p>

  <p>Even if they had fooled their enemies once, they still hadn't escaped all potential threats that awaited them.</p>

  <p>The Space Manipulating Spirits were highly talented in manipulating space.</p>

  <p>It was only a matter of time before they caught up with Zheng and his group for a full-blown confrontation.</p>

  <p>"The Space Manipulating Spirits are persistent when it comes to their cause.</p>

  <p>They will surely come after us and build a space channel." As Pearson spoke, he took out a handful of brown ash from his Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a blue thin line made itself visible as it extended from the sky in the distance. The speed at which it approached them was so fast that it was hard to keep track of it with the naked eye.</p>

  <p>It was none other than the Endless Corridor released by the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit.</p>

  <p>Without wasting a moment, Pearson blew on the ash that rested on his palm.</p>

  <p>The ash then spread backwards.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Even though it was small in size, it still covered a massive area. The nature of the space in this area had shifted from its previous form. The large space seemed to have solidified, then it turned into thousands of fragments and collapsed.</p>

  <p>The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit had initially planned to drive the Endless Corridor right in front of Zheng and the others to stop them in their tracks and later to teleport the bull-headed men and the other Space Manipulating Spirits there.</p>

  <p>The Endless Corridor was slightly different from the space channel. The space channel only closed the distance between two places, but the Endless Corridor had no limitations when it came to distance. It was lengthened or shortened at will by the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit. Therefore, regardless of the distance, they could cross it with something so simple as a single step.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Endless Corridor drilled into the space created by the ash.</p>

  <p>If an ordinary space channel touched the ash, only the first part would solidify and then shatter.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the Endless Corridor touched the ash, it solidified as a whole. With a loud splash, all of it was shattered as though it were nothing.</p>
