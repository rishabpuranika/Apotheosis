<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The passageways in the second floor and the first floor of the Ghost Mountain ran in opposing directions.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Altar at the innermost side of the second floor was right above the entrance to the first floor.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng and his group walked in a straight line on the second floor, the actual moving distance was several times shorter than the moving distance on the first floor. Their speed naturally increased greatly.</p>

  <p>It took them six hours to pass through the first floor and only one hour through the second floor.</p>

  <p>They passed through an area full of prisons which led to a high black wall.</p>

  <p>On the center of the black wall was a red arch covered with golden copper nails.</p>

  <p>"Here we are. Inside the copper gate is the Ghost Altar," said Bacchus.</p>

  <p>"We can see human beings in the Ghost Altar?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"It's possible. I've seen the human Great Ghost Priests two times recently,"</p>

  <p>Bacchus replied.</p>

  <p>A total of twelve Great Ghost Priests took charge of the Ghost Altar and the several human Great Ghost Priests were likely to be chosen as one of the twelve.</p>

  <p>"Then we are rest assured," Fuxi nodded.</p>

  <p>Bacchus thought for a moment. "But there are also exceptions. There have been several times that no human beings have appeared," he continued.</p>

  <p>There were about sixty Great Ghost Priests in the Ghost Mountain, and four of them came from the human race. The probability of choosing human beings from the sixty Great Ghost Priests was one-fifteenth.</p>

  <p>Zheng interrupted, "The probability of being selected as a Great Ghost Priest is low, right?"</p>

  <p>"Very. It's lucky if we succeed after hundreds of attempts. We have participated in the event so many times, but we still haven't figured out the rules. It seems that being chosen is completely determined by the preference of the twelve Great Ghost Priests and the hatred-level Treacherous Beings..." said Bacchus.</p>

  <p>"Then that's no problem. Since it's difficult to merge with a hatred-level Treacherous Being, let's try a few more times before the human Great Ghost Priests get a chance to be chosen," Zheng encouraged. he said while he walked forward.</p>

  <p>He stepped towards the red arch, stretched out his hands, and pushed the gate inward.</p>

  <p>"Clatter..."</p>

  <p>The gate opened noisily as pitch-black darkness revealed from the inside.</p>

  <p>The group went in and saw that the ground was painted with leaf-shaped glowing lines. The lines were dim, making them only slightly visible.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng leaned forward to touch the glowing lines, a ray of bright light transmitted along all the lines drawn on the ground. It was like a seed of fire that lit up the path it went.</p>

  <p>The light split into three parts which climbed up the surrounding pillars. It then connected to three huge radiant pearls, illuminating the entire Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>It was a circular hall with twelve entrances above it. These were the positions of the twelve Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Altar was currently closed as the entrances remained empty.</p>

  <p>In the center of the circular hall stood a pillar that was half a person tall.</p>

  <p>Above it was a round white stone ball. The stone ball had three holes on top appearing to have been specially carved out.</p>

  <p>"How do we open the Ghost Altar?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Stand in the center of the Ghost Altar and attach the stone ball to the glazed sheet," said Bacchus. "You can send someone to do it."</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!" Fuxi volunteered as he took a step ahead.</p>

  <p>Certainly, he wouldn't let go of the opportunity to obtain power.</p>

  <p>His cultivation had already reached the peak level of the Eternal Realm and his bloodline could not be changed. If he wanted to make a breakthrough, he could only change the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be many disadvantages of fusing with the Treacherous Beings. It would even cause the Treacherous Beings' counterattack, but being powerful had always been his goal.</p>

  <p>Fuxi walked to the center of the circular hall following Bacchus' instruction.</p>

  <p>He went closer to the pillar and connected the glazed sheet to the stone ball.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The huge stone ball began to rotate, seeming like the gesture had woken it up.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The twelve entrances then glowed with blue light as it showed a connection to space channels.</p>

  <p>A bunch of indefinite figures started to float out from the entrances. They were the Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and the others looked up excitedly, trying to detect the human beings among the Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>Among the thirty-nine human heroes, it was enough that only one of them appeared there!</p>

  <p>They searched eagerly as they looked around, yet to their dismay, they didn't find any human being. All of the Great Ghost Priests with strange-looking faces were from alien races.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests glanced back at them without a word, as if they were looking down at all living beings.</p>

  <p>"No human beings." Zheng shrugged.</p>

  <p>It was normal not to see human beings as there was a slim chance of encountering them.</p>

  <p>They turned to look at Fuxi again, wondering if he could fuse with a hatred-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>As the stone ball continued to roll, white entities emerged from its three holes. The entities quickly dispersed, turning into a huge creature–a white bull with three horns.</p>

  <p>"Moo!"</p>

  <p>The white bull let out a roar.</p>

  <p>An extremely terrifying aura reverberated throughout the circular hall, accompanied by indescribable pressure.</p>

  <p>"This is the hatred-level Treacherous Being. What appears now is only its avatar, not its real body!" Bacchus's eyes were filled with excitement.</p>

  <p>The hatred-level Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>Everyone gasped as their hearts raced with fear.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, this bull was of the friendly type and its frightening aura was still weak. Otherwise, bearing its aura would be a problem for everyone.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests suddenly began to clamor after the white bull's sound.</p>

  <p>"How could there be human beings here? This can't be!"</p>

  <p>"I won't allow a human being to be the Great Ghost Priest..."</p>

  <p>"It's not good to provoke these guys..."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree!"</p>

  <p>"No way..."</p>

  <p>All the Great Ghost Priests from above the circular hall rejected Fuxi with a unified voice.</p>

  <p>Hearing the complaints of the Great Ghost Priests, Fuxi asked loudly,</p>

  <p>"What's the problem? Why don't you agree?"</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests turned around coldly and disappeared back into the space channels.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, can you tell me the reason?" Fuxi insisted, waving his hand helplessly.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Great Ghost Priests had all left.</p>

  <p>The unknown bull with three horns also returned into the stone ball.</p>

  <p>Fuxi hung his head down, soon retreating from the center of the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>"It's normal to fail to be chosen as the Great Ghost Priest. I've tried many times, but I haven't succeeded even once," comforted Bacchus.</p>

  <p>"I think they have a prejudice against the human race," said Fuxi as his lips curled into a frown.</p>

  <p>Decker suddenly asked, "Isn't the process of choosing the Great Ghost Priest simple? Everyone can have a try, right?"</p>

  <p>Bacchus glared at Decker and said, "The Ghost Altar itself is used for the natural process of selection. Of course, it doesn't need to be complicated."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you let the members of our Wooden Leaf race have a try?</p>

  <p>Why did you say that only a creature that has fused with the resentment-level Treacherous Being could get a chance?" Decker asked gloomily.</p>

  <p>A Glede Demon beside Decker sneered, "If everyone wants to try on the second floor of the Ghost Mountain, won't the status of our three races be easily affected?"</p>

  <p>The Grand Mighty race, the Red Demon race, and the Glede Demon race had always fiercely competed with each other.</p>

  <p>However, they cooperated very well in keeping the secret of the second floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>According to the normal process, the soldiers of the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race and the Grand Mighty race stood guard in front of the Ghost Mountain. If members of other races entered the Ghost Mountain, they would be escorted by the members of these three races.</p>

  <p>Ordinary races could enter the first floor and the second floor.</p>

  <p>As long as they were able to merge with a hostility-level Treacherous Being or even a resentment-level Treacherous Being, they wouldn't be stopped by the three races.</p>

  <p>However, the races weren't allowed to enter the Ghost Altar. The three races had also declared that to become the Great Ghost Priest, one had to challenge a resentment-level or even a hatred-level Treacherous Being. If the warriors failed to be careful, they would be killed during the battle.</p>

  <p>The races of the Night View Island were skeptical of the process, but they didn't dare challenge the three races.</p>

  <p>Bacchus saw that Decker was displeased. "Although luck is a big factor during the selection of the Great Ghost Priest, one's strength also affects the Treacherous Being's choice. Go ahead and try if you are not convinced," he said as he waved his wings.</p>
