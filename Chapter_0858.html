<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At this moment, Boris looked like a wild beast from ancient times.</p>

  <p>Any warrior who could enter the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin would at least be a tenth-level war general. But regardless of their rank, their heart would start pounding if they were surrounded by Boris's powerful aura.</p>

  <p>"Boris is really strong! Even a war lord on the eleventh floor might not have such an imposing aura."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Boris is known as the unbeatable war general, so he must be very strong!"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, Zheng is still the most marvelous talent. Although he's only a tenth-level war fighter, he's able to suppress Boris. If a warrior who has just reached the war lord realm isn't a match for Boris, doesn't that mean that Zheng can defeat a small portion of the war lords by taking advantage of his cultivation base?"</p>

  <p>When Boris's aura and power suddenly burst out of him, the forceful energy within his body also erupted. He stomped his feet on the arena and two sunken footprints appeared on the floor!</p>

  <p>"What great speed!" Zheng's gaze flickered as the long sword in his hand hovered lightly, instinctively blocking him from harm.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sacred long sword was small with a blade as wide as only three fingers while Boris's broad-bladed saber was incomparably large.</p>

  <p>When Boris saw that Zheng was trying to use a sword to block his saber, a vicious grin appeared on his face. As he charged toward Zheng, he swung his saber and brought it down to Zheng's head with the momentum of thunder.</p>

  <p>"Thunder Hacking!"</p>

  <p>Boris wasn't concerned about whether Zheng was trying to block his attack with a long sword or a mountain on his back. No matter what it was, Boris could chop it all into pieces with one slash.</p>

  <p>The forceful energy surged out of Boris's body. On the back of his saber, countless streaks of scarlet lightning appeared. This was the blade intent that Boris had learned, and it also contained the special power of thunder and lightning.</p>

  <p>There were many similarities between Boris's blade intent and Tianming's Extreme Thunder Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't Zheng dodge?"</p>

  <p>"He's even choosing to take the blow head-on!"</p>

  <p>"It's too dangerous for him to let his sword collide with Boris's large saber since his sword doesn't have an advantage in the first place. Moreover, Boris's saber is huge, so he might even chop it down!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's face was filled with confusion as various thoughts went through their minds.</p>

  <p>"He's too confident!" Olivia couldn't help but shout out at this moment.</p>

  <p>Zheng had other methods to resist Boris's attack, but he chose to face it head-on. Apart from his incomparable confidence, Olivia couldn't think of any other reasonable explanation for his actions.</p>

  <p>"Power of dragon scales! Activate!"</p>

  <p>The dragon scales in Zheng's mind lit up bit by bit, emitting jade-green light.</p>

  <p>As the heavy power continued to fill Zheng's body, an extremely confident smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He had quite a few methods to resist Boris's move.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, he also understood that Boris wouldn't stop attacking him until he was dead. The ogre war lords below the arena definitely wouldn't let him off either.</p>

  <p>Since the talent test had already set off waves in the Tower of Sin, Zheng wanted to make the waves more violent, suppressing the ogre's aggressiveness and arrogance.</p>

  <p>And the prelude to suppressing Boris was his sword strike.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's long sword finally collided with Boris's saber.</p>

  <p>In everyone's eyes, this was a peerlessly powerful saber strike. It was obvious that Boris had channeled all of his power for this strike. It was also the most powerful strike that Boris had ever performed.</p>

  <p>Even war lords from the upper floors wouldn't dare to face this strike head-on.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, stood rooted to the spot without any resistance, holding his sword in front of his body and swinging it ever so slightly to defend himself.</p>

  <p>But even though his sword barely moved, it stood firmly in front of Zheng like an iron lock and successfully blocked Boris's strike.</p>

  <p>The entire scene was strange and shocking.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the warrior who attacked first had a great advantage in power because of his sprint. So, if the warrior's opponent could block his attack without even moving, it meant that the opponent's strength was much greater than his.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was just a human while Boris was an ogre. How could Zheng block Boris's strike in this situation? In terms of talent, the ogre's strength was far greater than that of humans. On top of that, Boris's main focus was on body refinement. Although his body was much smaller than that of ordinary ogres, the explosive power stored within him was very powerful and impressive. Anyone who fought with him could figure that out.</p>

  <p>That was why the situation they were in now was all the more inexplicable.</p>

  <p>It was as if Zheng could easily block Boris's terrible attack with a single, gentle sword strike.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of Boris, Zheng looked like an insurmountable wall that couldn't be moved at all. The difference in their strengths was obvious at this moment.</p>

  <p>Boris and all the other creatures on the tenth floor were shocked. Malcom was stunned as well.</p>

  <p>Just now, seeing Zheng play around with Boris while battling him, Malcom had been determined to kill Zheng. Now, Malcom was even more sure that he had to get rid of this guy as soon as possible. If he let him continue cultivating in the tower, it wouldn't be long before Zheng would rise to prominence. By then, the ogres wouldn't have so much as a foothold in the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>With that thought, Malcom decided to rush into the arena. It was obvious that Boris was no match for Zheng, so not only did Malcom want to kill Zheng, but he also wanted to save Boris. Although Boris couldn't defeat Zheng, he was still the most important talent of the two sacred places in the ogre. In the future, Boris would definitely obtain a seat at the top of the tower. So, Malcom could never allow Zheng to kill Boris.</p>

  <p>Boris slowly moved his saber away from Zheng's long sword. Although he maintained a calm expression, he felt his hand holding the saber become powerless and weak.</p>

  <p>Realizing the difference between him and Zheng had been a big blow to him.</p>

  <p>The disappointment made him feel as if a monster had risen up in his heart to torment him. That monster roared continuously at him, telling him how big the gap was between him and Zheng.</p>

  <p>'I've lost...' he thought.</p>

  <p>The reason why he had conceded so straightforwardly was not because he didn't have the spirit to fight.</p>

  <p>In fact, Boris's warrior spirit was extremely tenacious. But this time, the failure of his saber strike had exhausted all of his confidence.</p>

  <p>After ten years of preparing for cultivation and succeeding in it, he had helplessly discovered that he couldn't defeat a mere young man. This was the only thought that was going through his mind.</p>

  <p>All the pride and confidence that he had been holding all these years had vanished into nothingness after this single saber strike.</p>

  <p>He had always been regarded as the strongest amongst the war generals and the most outstanding talent of the two sacred places of the ogre, but after his failed saber strike, he felt that all of these high praises had become laughable.</p>

  <p>Zheng withdrew his sword, gripping the sword hilt. Then, he cupped his hands and looked at Boris. "Thank you for letting me win!"</p>

  <p>In the arena, the winner could kill the loser, but Zheng didn't kill Boris. It wasn't because he feared the ogre. He had blocked Boris's attack to fully display his strength and talent and improve his prestige. Since he had achieved his goal, he didn't feel the need to kill Boris. He wanted to make the other races understand that the human race wasn't weak.</p>

  <p>Another reason Zheng didn't take Boris's life was because Boris was the only ogre that he admired.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even if he killed Boris, it wouldn't mean much.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>A thick ray of Lucky Light shot out of Boris's chest and settled into the token on Zheng's.</p>

  <p>It was just as Zheng had estimated: he had obtained a considerable amount of Lucky Light on the tenth floor. This was one of the reasons why he had wanted to climb to the tenth floor as quickly as possible. On this floor, he could accumulate Lucky Light faster.</p>

  <p>Boris walked down the arena unhappily, carrying his saber. He looked like a walking corpse as he staggered along.</p>

  <p>Even though his warrior spirit was extremely tough, after the severe blow he had just faced, his spirit had been almost destroyed by Zheng. Now, he'd have to cultivate more and gain some insights. If he could achieve enlightenment during his cultivation, then his strength would greatly increase. He would become more powerful and frightening than he was now. However, if he couldn't gain enough insights or enhance his cultivation base, he might not be able to make any great achievement in martial arts in his whole life.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, since our war general couldn't defeat you, let me personally fight against you! Would you like to accept my challenge?" Malcom jumped off the spectator stand, ready to step into the arena.</p>

  <p>His words surprised everyone in the area. Their expressions changed all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Tower of Sin, the warriors in the upper floors could enter the lower floors, but they weren't allowed to go into the arenas of the lower floors to battle with others.</p>

  <p>This rule was to maintain the balance in the Tower of Sin. If one couldn't defeat his opponents on the floor he was in and went to challenge others on the lower floors to accumulate Lucky Light, the tower would be in a mess.</p>

  <p>Anyone would be able to accumulate Lucky Light this way.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Malcom to not know about the rules. Since he was still choosing to come out and challenge Zheng, it could only be said that he was being shameless.</p>
