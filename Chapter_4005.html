<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4005 Les </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After five out of its six heads were all cut off, the male eagle was scared to death and tried to flee.</p>

  <p>It didn't dare to attack Luo Zheng again and quickly flew high as it trembled.</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>The female eagle, which was also badly injured, rendezvoused with the male eagle and retreated with it.</p>

  <p>As the pair of six-headed eagles battled with Luo Zheng, they had lost a total of nine heads.</p>

  <p>They were still lucky that they survived even though facing such a powerful opponent. All their aggressiveness vanished, and they just wanted to save themselves right now.</p>

  <p>As for the falling eggs, they didn't even have the time to look back and care about them.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>As the six-headed eagles had already flown quite a distance, a bolt of dragon-shaped lightning suddenly surged down from the sky and assaulted them.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagles instantly turned into ashes, drifting away in the wind, as the dazzling lightning struck them.</p>

  <p>When everyone saw the tremendous lightning, everyone on the mountain was taken aback. They knew that it wasn't natural lightning and that someone was responsible for it.</p>

  <p>"Who the heck released such lightning of that caliber?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked with his brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>The lightning contained irregular crystals, and the energy it emitted was devastating.</p>

  <p>When Pearson saw the dragon-shaped lightning, his eyes widened and he felt that his throat became dry. There was a mixed emotion of fear and hatred written all over his face. "It must be Les, one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization."</p>

  <p>Les was such a formidable opponent. Back then, he led a team to surround and suppress a group of Eternal Realm Hunters, killing six of them in the process.</p>

  <p>"Although he's a bit weaker than Claire, he enjoys the same status as her," the Snake Goddess explained.</p>

  <p>"Really? That guy's absolutely powerful then." Eastern Emperor Taiyi's expression changed a little as he realized the trouble that they were about to face.</p>

  <p>The other people at the back of the Wing King also looked sullen.</p>

  <p>Back when they were in the Source World, they managed to defeat Claire.</p>

  <p>This was because the people of the Li Shan mountain and the Chaos Ancient Gods could fully display their strength. On the other hand, Claire's power was limited as she came with the Xuanyuan's body.</p>

  <p>Now that they were on the Other Shore, the situation was reversed. As a creature on the Other Shore, Les could readily use all of his strength, while the Eternal Realm masters would be the one with the handicap. Obviously, the gap between their strength would be so immense.</p>

  <p>Worse, Luo Zheng was still under the control of the Treacherous Being, and they hadn't found a way to save him yet. It meant that they couldn't rely on his strength right now.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>Continuous bolts of lightning lashed down as if a creature made up of lightning was rapidly approaching.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>A final bolt of lightning struck a nearby mountain. Immediately after, a transparent sphere appeared with Les floating within.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Les greeted them with a loud chuckle. "How dumb can you be? If you're here to save the trapped humans, then you've chosen the wrong path."</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng and his companions were saved by the Wing King back in the Grand Pure Realm, the Element Spirit Civilization tracked them through the Shadow Marks.</p>

  <p>But after they entered the Whining Road, the Element Spirit Civilization had lost all their traces.</p>

  <p>However, a few days later when they left the Whining Road, the Shadow Marks began sending out messages of their whereabouts again. With this, even with no Shadow Warriors tailing them, they could still estimate their location.</p>

  <p>After a brief discussion with Claire and Slade, Les decided to take action and resolve the matter personally.</p>

  <p>At first, Slade insisted on coming with Les, but he strongly refused.</p>

  <p>Since Les had overwhelming power on the Other Shore, he had so much pride. Bringing Slade meant that countless warriors of the Element Spirit race would accompany him. He felt that it was an insult to his capabilities.</p>

  <p>Claire, on the other hand, didn't say anything. She actually didn't like Les.</p>

  <p>Since she had failed once before, now she was eager to see Les go alone and return in a crushing defeat.</p>

  <p>It appeared that the Shadow Marks that Les were tracing were on the bodies of the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi. However, the moment that he saw Luo Zheng, his attention shifted to him and treated the rest of them as insignificant nuisances.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Luo Zheng's current state wasn't that clear to Les. He thought that Luo Zheng would open the passage where the human heroes were trapped, but he had overturned the wrong mountains.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being that controlled Luo Zheng's body glanced coldly at Les before it began running towards the west again.</p>

  <p>It was going to overturn another mountain.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sudden movement of Luo Zheng's body, Les let out a smirk. 'Does this guy really want to play a game of tag with me?'</p>

  <p>Lightning flashed on the surface of his sphere as he started chasing after the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! We also have to follow him!"</p>

  <p>The Wing King flapped his wings and followed Les while carrying everyone on his back.</p>

  <p>The men in black stayed where they were.</p>

  <p>Three of them each held an egg in their arms. They decided to take them back first.</p>

  <p>The eggs appeared translucent under the sunlight, making the dark-green liquid and the embryos of the six-headed eagles visible. The liquid contained in the eggs was extremely corrosive, so they had to be very careful in handling them. If they accidentally broke one, their bodies would surely be corroded.</p>

  <p>"Father, let's go home," urged the son of the leader.</p>

  <p>Although many of their clansmen had died in the process, they were still very lucky to obtain the eggs in the end.</p>

  <p>The son was worried that if they stayed for too long, problems might start to arise.</p>

  <p>"That human is very special," the leader said.</p>

  <p>"But that's not a battle that we can participate in," the son of the leader answered calmly. "Father, please don't forget that this is the Light Region."</p>

  <p>Their race was actually powerful.</p>

  <p>After all, they had to possess sufficient strength to be able to gain a foothold in the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>However, they were unable to display the fullest of their abilities in the Light Region. They were like sharks stuck on the shore. No matter how powerful and sharp their teeth were, there was nothing they could do as they faced the six-headed eagles.</p>

  <p>"I still want to know more," the leader voiced out firmly. "After all, he saved us."</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to follow you!"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to be of service!"</p>

  <p>"Please take me with you, chief!"</p>

  <p>Some of the people in black robes had also felt the same as their leader.</p>

  <p>The leader was relieved. After selecting more than twenty men from their group, he led them quickly in the direction where Luo Zheng had gone. The remaining members returned to their home, led by the leader's son.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Another dragon-shaped lightning struck down and made a huge crater on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being was still controlling Luo Zheng's body. It continued to run fast without any intention of fighting Les. It just wanted to overturn the right mountain according to its original plan, but Les had been pestering it from behind all this time.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Les noticed that there was something strange with the seemingly ordinary way of Luo Zheng's running. There was an odd bodily movement skill incorporated with it.</p>

  <p>When Les employed his token, Luo Zheng was absolutely shrouded in his lightning. However, just the next moment, he dashed out unharmed, as if his body and the lightning were in two different dimensions.</p>

  <p>This made Les rather confused. He tried to think and come up with an explanation.</p>

  <p>However, he hadn't seen this kind of token from Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom! Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>Les released four immense lightning strikes in a row, but the result was still the same.</p>

  <p>He clearly saw that Luo Zheng's figure had entered the field of lightning, but he wasn't able to sense Luo Zheng's existence at all.</p>

  <p>"What kind of strange ability is that?!" Les yelled in frustration. "Let's see how you dodge this one!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the transparent sphere of Les suddenly appeared above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The surface of the transparent sphere began to flash with five-colored bolts of lightning. The red, green, purple, black, and blue bolts of lightning appeared like small serpents that tried to envelop Luo Zheng's head.</p>
