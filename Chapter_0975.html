  <p>
</p>

  <p>To the Ethereal Spirit Sect, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity!</p>

  <p>How could the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit dare to be negligent at this moment?</p>

  <p>Although the Dragon-trapping Rope was one of the Ethereal Spirit Sect's trump cards, Eddie was still the number one warrior in the Central Region. This worried them and made them uncertain towards the whole situation. Furthermore, the black mist emitted by Eddie was continuously corroding the Dragon-trapping Rope. If Eddie would successfully destroy the Dragon-trapping Rope, the Ethereal Spirit Sect's plan would fall apart and everything that they had done would be in vain. And they could not afford any of that.</p>

  <p>After the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit formed the Seven-in-one Array, their collective strength had increased considerably. The one leading them had actually already reached the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Then, as the Seven-in-one Array could fuse the powers of the seven of them, they believed that if they were to launch a sword attack, it would definitely take Eddie's life!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword light of the person in the lead of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit suddenly erupted and pierced into the black mist.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the black mist nervously. Because Eddie was trapped by the Dragon-trapping Rope, he could not use his life vitality. Now, if the sword hit him, he would definitely not be able to block it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng stared at the black fog, a sudden bad premonition arose in his heart. From the day he first stepped into the Central Region, he had already regarded Eddie as his opponent and the biggest obstacle in his path of cultivation. He did not believe that Eddie would be that easily dealt with.</p>

  <p>Compared to Zheng, however, the others felt very confident. For example, Robin, the head of the Xi Clan, believed that if he could help the Ethereal Spirit Sect get rid of Eddie, the Xi Clan would be famous not only in the Central Region, but throughout the whole world.</p>

  <p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>

  <p>Just as the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit combined their powers to launch a powerful attack, sounds of metal breaking were suddenly heard. Soon after, everyone saw several beams of light shooting out from the black fog.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>The light beams contained a great amount of power, and they instantly hit the chests of the four people of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit.</p>

  <p>However, the light beams did not stop there— they all pierced through chests of the four people, causing blood to spurt from their chests and backs. The sudden attack created terrifying gaping holes in their chests, and after a few moments, the four people fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>It was only then that everyone was able to clearly see that the light beams were actually sword fragments. Not only was the sword attack of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit unable to kill Eddie, it had shot back at them after shattering, instantly killing four of them.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Brother!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>As this was happening, everyone's expression began to change dramatically. The cries of the remaining three of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit rang out loud and clear, adding to the despair of the people watching.</p>

  <p>The Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit had shared the same food and the same bedroom all their lives, and because of that, they had reached a level of mutual understanding that was greater than siblings'. They had made explorations in the Central Region for so many years without a single one of them dying. The sudden deaths of four people were something that they would not be able to deal with.</p>

  <p>As the black mist gradually dispersed, everyone saw that the Dragon-trapping Rope that was originally binding Eddie's body was beginning to break. Then, the light of the Dragon-trapping Rope slowly disappeared.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Eddie's body was emitting a violent aura, and his skin was starting to get covered with layers of scales.</p>

  <p>"Forcing me into this state is far more annoying than I initially thought it would be! In order to return the favor, I will murder the entire Ethereal Spirit Sect. Ha-ha!" Eddie roared as he laughed crazily. Then, his expression changed. The entire Ethereal City seemed to be shrouded in his presence. Other than him, there seemed to be no other existence.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted. Immediately, he wasted no time and rushed towards Margaret to catch hold of her. The life vitality within his body began to madly revolve while at the same time, his forceful energy started erupting. With both his life vitality and forceful energy working, he moved at a crazy speed.</p>

  <p>His premonition was indeed correct. Since Eddie had the confidence to establish his own divine kingdom, he definitely had methods to deal with the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill you!"</p>

  <p>The Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit had lived and breathed as a single person. With the other four dead, the remaining three wouldn't be able to live on!</p>

  <p>Other than the remaining three of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit, the other people had no urge to fight anymore. Facing Eddie in such a state was simply courting death. Because of that, Brent and Robin did not stop Zheng when they saw him taking Margaret away. Both of them knew that she would be much safer with Zheng than with them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Brent and Robin ran in two different directions.</p>

  <p>The remaining three of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit tried their best to stall Eddie for them. Although they would not be able to beat Eddie, they were still warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm and would be able to stall him for a while.</p>

  <p>Zheng was all up in his head, thinking of ways to run away from Eddie. He had expected that Eddie would not be easily killed, but he did not expect him to be this strong. In the past, Zheng was able to block one or two attacks from Eddie, and with his speed, he could run away from him. But now, at Eddie's current cultivation level, it seemed that Zheng would be unable to block a single attack from him.</p>

  <p>With all these in his head, Zheng rushed forward, and in just a short span of time, he was already out of the Ethereal City. Outside Ethereal City were boundless mountains, and going at one direction, he once again released the forceful energy within his body, transforming into a beam of light zooming through the air.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's flying speed, he would only need three days to reach Cloudy City without the aid of a transmission array.</p>

  <p>But, would Eddie not chase after him?</p>

  <p>Zheng was originally Eddie's target, and now, adding to that, he also had Margaret with him. This woman was also someone Eddie had to get.</p>

  <p>After taking care of the remaining of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit, Eddie would definitely chase them and catch up.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, within just five minutes, Zheng saw a black dot appear behind him. That small black dot was none other than Eddie.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's speed was incredibly fast, the speed of the black dot wasn't far from his.</p>

  <p>If Zheng stopped using his forceful energy, the black dot would easily catch up to them. But Zheng couldn't just use his forceful energy non-stop. This was a limitation of the body refiners that even Zheng was unable to avoid it. When Zheng had just entered the Sea God Continent, he had been also chased by three ogre war lords, just like what was happening now, and had been almost caught up to in the end, the reason being that he was unable to replenish his forceful energy in time.</p>

  <p>"Holy crap! We're in trouble!"</p>

  <p>Zheng said aloud, his brows furrowed deeply.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't notice that Margaret was acting like a piece of wood, expressionlessly resting on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was thinking about how to deal with the whole situation, Margaret suddenly said, "Zheng, kill me."</p>

  <p>If he killed Margaret, then Zheng wouldn't need to carry such a big person while running. His speed would significantly increase and the probability of him escaping Eddie would be better.</p>

  <p>If it was anyone else, Zheng would just leave alone, believing that Eddie would not cause trouble for others. However, since Margaret possessed the Purple Power Body, she was also someone that Eddie had to obtain.</p>

  <p>As he thought about it, Zheng realized how hard of a decision he was being forced to make.</p>

  <p>"Kill you?" Xun, who was flying alongside Zheng, laughed coldly.</p>

  <p>"Are you not afraid of death anymore?"</p>

  <p>Margaret's face revealed a determined look. "In the past, I was very afraid of death. But now I'm not afraid anymore."</p>

  <p>Today was indeed a sad day for Margaret. She suddenly felt that she was a fool in everyone's eyes. Although the members of the Xi Clan treated her very well, no one trusted her, not even Brent, who she grew up with.</p>

  <p>With that, Margaret had become dejected like never before.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Xun's spear suddenly appeared, and it was pointed to Margaret. Xun really intended to kill her. The tip of the spear was only inches away from Margaret's forehead. In Xun's eyes, only by killing her would Zheng be able to run away with all his might and successfully evade Eddie. She had wanted to kill Margaret for a long time now.</p>

  <p>"Stop," Zheng suddenly ordered, his voice devoid of emotion.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, if she dies, we'll have a better chance of escaping! Think about that!" Xun said, still aiming at Margaret's forehead.</p>

  <p>"I know," replied Zheng, staring straight ahead.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you let me kill her?" Xun asked again. She felt it was unwise to drag a burden like Margaret especially in this kind of situation.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a deep breath, and forceful energy burst out of him once more, propelling him to run faster. After his speed suddenly increased, Zheng said, "I know another way."</p>

  <p>After they passed through countless mountains outside Ethereal City, a plain appeared. It was shrouded in clouds and mist. This was the biggest swamp in the Central Region— the Dreamy Swampland.</p>
