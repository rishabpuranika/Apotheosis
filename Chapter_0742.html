<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If anyone present shared the same feeling as Owen, it was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Both of them were chasing the same goal. As Luo Luo Zheng witnessed Owen's miserable ending, all sorts of feelings welled up in his heart.</p>

  <p>However, Owen's miserable end didn't waver his own resolve to kill Marilyn. Instead, he was now even more determined to do it. Now, Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes, trying his best not to look in Marilyn's direction, for he was afraid that his killing intent was too difficult to suppress and would be detected by her.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie sat behind Luo Luo Zheng in silence. She wanted to say something through her life vitality, but in the end she just let out a quiet sigh. She knew very well that she could not persuade Luo Luo Zheng in any way. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng had proved that he was strong enough to fight a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm. He had a lot of cards up his sleeves. At any given moment, no one knew how he could trump his opponent.</p>

  <p>However, the moment Luo Luo Zheng tried to kill Marilyn, Eddie would certainly take action. He wouldn't just let it slide.</p>

  <p>The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance could not foresee Luo Luo Zheng killing Marilyn, nor did they have any way of being informed of it beforehand. The three obese men would not be able to stop Eddie from retaliating in anger.</p>

  <p>That was to say, Luo Luo Zheng would fall into an impossible situation.</p>

  <p>As Ning Yudie came to this conclusion, she bit her lower lip and looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her eyes revealed a trace of determination, as if she had already made a decision in her heart.</p>

  <p>On the arena, Marilyn looked down at Owen. The latter was unable to move even an inch. "I won't kill you, but you will be tormented cruelly if I keep you alive," Marilyn said in a soft voice. "In fact, the Lustful Demon Array is perfect for your lover. After all her six senses are sealed, she would be able to reach the Internal Elixir Realm. Moreover, after she gives up her virginity energy for the sake of the Lustful Demon Array, she would be able to absorb Eddie's male vitality and step into the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>The Lustful Demon Array is an excellent technique to induce lust. It permits one to enjoy the pleasures of the mortal world."</p>

  <p>Hearing Marilyn's words, Owen, who was firmly pinned down by the black thorns, started to tremble. The thorns and the crimson flowers shook with the movement too.</p>

  <p>He stared at Marilyn with lifeless eyes. His bloodstained lips moved as he muttered something in a hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>"What did you just say?" Marilyn asked Owen, walking up to him.</p>

  <p>Owen sputtered, blood trickling out of his mouth as he spoke with some difficulty, "I said, old virgin!"</p>

  <p>Marilyn's expression changed abruptly. She raised her hand, turning it into a blade. About to chop Owen's head off, she stopped at the last moment, the blade inches away from his forehead. He could see it from the corner of his eyes. "You want to provoke me into killing you," she said, a sullen smile shaping her mouth. "But I won't do that. I know you want to die, but I won't allow it."</p>

  <p>Before coming to Oracle City, Owen had done exhaustive groundwork. He had thoroughly investigated Eddie and the people always around him. He knew Marilyn had been with Eddie for decades, but she was yet a virgin owing to the Lustful Demon Array. Naturally, she hated being called an old virgin.</p>

  <p>By then, everyone knew who the winner was. "Independent warrior Marilyn Si wins!" Xiao announced loudly. "Independent warrior Owen Ao loses!"</p>

  <p>As the light curtain of the enchanted barrier was removed, members of the World Commercial Alliance carried Owen off the arena. Now, it was Marilyn's turn to draw a card.</p>

  <p>She reached into the drawing box and took a card out. Then, she looked at the stand of Cloud Hall with a meaningful smile, meeting Luo Zheng's fiery gaze.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat as he realized right away that Marilyn wanted to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Eddie had always been condescending to Luo Luo Zheng, but he was well aware that the latter had put an end to Eden's dedication to the martial arts. Eden, Eddie's only son, was supposed to ascend to the throne one day. Eddie was heartbroken to witness it, so he hated Luo Luo Zheng with a passion.</p>

  <p>For him, killing Luo Luo Zheng on the arena would be the best way to avenge Eden. It was the reason why Marilyn looked at him like that when she was drawing the card.</p>

  <p>If she drew the challenge card, it was very likely that she would challenge him at the first possible moment.</p>

  <p>What she didn't know was that it was exactly what Luo Luo Zheng wanted from her.</p>

  <p>Unwittingly, she was playing right into Luo Zheng's hands. He too hoped that she would draw a challenge card.</p>

  <p>The small wooden card was flipped open. Upon seeing the word 'exemption' on it, a disappointed look came over Marilyn's face. She glanced at Luo Luo Zheng for a moment before returning to Eddie's stand.</p>

  <p>By now, everyone had realized that Marilyn wanted to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, a single challenge card wouldn't be very useful for her. If Luo Luo Zheng wanted to refuse her challenge, he could easily use one of his exemption cards and deny her.</p>

  <p>But the truth was that Luo Luo Zheng too was disappointed. He had been waiting to fight it out with Marilyn. It was a pity she did not pick a challenge card.</p>

  <p>After the guards of the World Commercial Alliance had carried Owen off the arena, they began helping him get the thorns off his body.</p>

  <p>The black thorns seemed to be growing along Owen's veins, destroying his blood vessels. To cure him, the thorns needed to be removed.</p>

  <p>The guards did their job. As each thorn was pulled out, blood spilled out.</p>

  <p>The process was bloody and grimy.</p>

  <p>However, everyone from the World Commercial Alliance had been prepared for this. Because they chose to enter the arena, they had readied themselves for any prospects of injury or even death.</p>

  <p>Soon, Xiao announced the drawing result for the next match.</p>

  <p>"It is Brent of Ethereal Spirit Sect versus Joel Huang of Mysterious Luna Hall!"</p>

  <p>It was another battle between sect disciples. More importantly, one of the competitors was Brent of Ethereal Spirit Sect!</p>

  <p>As the only divine-level talent of Ethereal Spirit Sect, Brent was quite popular. He was the youngest participant of the Martial Arts Contest and had only reached the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, so he attracted much attention.</p>

  <p>"It's finally his turn! Brent of Ethereal Spirit Sect is to fight! I've been waiting for him for a long time. I've bet all my money on him!"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter how powerful he is. He is only at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. He might be a divine-level talent, but Eden, another one of those, was battered by Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Luo Luo Zheng is not even at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>He is just at its fourth grade. It seems that the divine-level talents are not as powerful as they say. Brent's opponent cannot be underestimated. He is a principal disciple of the Mysterious Luna Hall."</p>

  <p>The warriors displayed great interest in Brent's first match. The scene quickly became fervent again.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's focus was not on the arena at all. He was paying close attention to Owen, who was receiving treatment for the thorns.</p>

  <p>Halfway through his treatment, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly spoke to Ning Yudie through his life vitality. Receiving a golden pill from her, he jumped off the stands and walked toward Owen, who was floating between life and death.</p>

  <p>Owen was a man of iron. He had far exceeded Luo Zheng's expectations. He had already lost half of his blood and his entire body was riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>However, he still managed to remain clear-headed. Due to utter weakness, he was no longer able to move.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw Luo Luo Zheng, a strange look appeared in his eyes. He didn't have any relationship with Luo Luo Zheng. He had traveled thousands of miles from the Woolen Grassland for the competition. Besides his lover, there was no one he knew in Oracle City.</p>

  <p>During the pre-qualifying match, Luo Luo Zheng had blackmailed Owen into giving him a great number of supreme life vitality crystals. 'Why did he come over?' Owen wondered inwardly, still bitter over the fact.</p>

  <p>"This is a grade 6 pill. It can save your life," Luo Luo Zheng whispered to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had asked Ning Yudie for the pill. He might not have anything to do with Owen. Owen's death wouldn't change anything for him. But when Luo Luo Zheng sensed Owen's resolve, he thought that he should step forward to help the thrashed boy.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie didn't have many grade 6 pills with her. It was a high-quality healing panacea of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Owen asked with great difficulty, his voice suspicious.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng used his life vitality to wrap the pill. With a gentle pinch, the golden pill cracked open. Then, with a slight movement of his finger, the pill turned into powder and floated to Owen's mouth.</p>

  <p>Hearing the question, Luo Luo Zheng blinked. Other than Ning Yudie and her master, no one else knew the answer to it. In the end, Luo Luo Zheng chose to reply to Owen through his life vitality. "Why? Because we have the same goal."</p>

  <p>Owen's eyes had long lost their luster. He had surmised that his failure meant that his life was meaningless.</p>

  <p>However, as he heard Luo Luo Zheng, his originally listless eyes began to shine and glimmer. He opened his mouth in excitement, saying, "You, you?"</p>

  <p>Unlike Luo Luo Zheng, Owen had done a thorough investigation on Eddie before arriving in Oracle City. Not only did he investigate the identity of Marilyn, he also dug up information on the other woman with the Purple Power Body. It suddenly occurred to him that the woman's name was Yan Luo.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's surname was Luo too. Owen did the math, comprehension dawning on him. At once, he understood who Luo Luo Zheng was.</p>
