<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The thick clouds swirled and trembled even more violently when the Snake Goddess pointed her finger towards the void. Then, she spoke in an oddly mysterious voice, "I can show you the first scene of this round of chaos."</p>

  <p>As soon as she was finished, drops of sweet rain fell down.</p>

  <p>"Ticking! Ticking! Ticking..."</p>

  <p>In turn, Yan reached out to catch the raindrops, only to find that they were just illusions.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the clouds in the distance disappeared and were replaced by a brown ocean.</p>

  <p>The current Source World had expanded to an extremely large size.</p>

  <p>However, during the beginning of the chaos, the Source World was born as a primitive land, much like an inner world.</p>

  <p>The entire Source World was drowned in the sea and over the endless years, the seeds of life gradually sprouted. The most primitive creatures were born.</p>

  <p>That particular scene was quite similar to what happened with Zheng's inner world when it was first created.</p>

  <p>Just then, six light cocoons floated in the vast sky. The light cocoons were translucent, and the shapes of the creatures inside them could be seen easily through their diaphanous structure.</p>

  <p>"Are they Chaos Ancient Gods?" Zheng asked as he raised his head. The Snake Goddess nodded. Indeed, they were the only living creatures in the last round of chaos.</p>

  <p>They had passed through the chaos' empty and lonely stage and observed the Ways-blending Energy. Each of them had learned their own truths.</p>

  <p>"I see my master! He is the second on the left!" No. 9527 exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the light cocoon it mentioned. Inside the second light cocoon on the left was a shadow shaped like a scorpion.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never seen Gerald's appearance before.</p>

  <p>Gerald's body was buried below the ground, and Zheng couldn't see that.</p>

  <p>He only knew that Gerald was very large in size, and a piece of his rib was as big as a towering mountain. He didn't expect that Gerald was a scorpion with a large body.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the figures who were in the other light cocoons were different. Their features couldn't be recognized simply from their shapes.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>The rain in the illusion became heavier and heavier, accompanied by the loud thunder.</p>

  <p>Tens of millions of years, and even billions of years passed...</p>

  <p>It was said that time could easily bring a great change to the world, but how could the sea in the primitive land change greatly so effortlessly?</p>

  <p>After countless years, some creatures finally appeared in the sea.</p>

  <p>Then, the smallest plankton slowly developed and the fish appeared.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked curious and bewildered when he saw the fish that swam in the sea. He said, "How did these fish grow like this?"</p>

  <p>Although there were many sorts of strange fish, those specific fish in this sea looked especially odd.</p>

  <p>The fish's brain was surprisingly large and was out of proportion to their body. "You'll know when you keep on seeing the development," the Snake Goddess responded.</p>

  <p>The fish passed by, and time sped up by a million times in this illusion.</p>

  <p>The sea level quickly went down, and the first patch of land appeared.</p>

  <p>Eventually, some fish got washed ashore.</p>

  <p>Only then did Zheng understand why those fish looked so strange. Their huge heads continuously shrank and their bodies began to elongate. They retained the fangs in their mouths, and they became the wolves.</p>

  <p>He was suddenly enlightened as he thought of what the Snake Goddess had said earlier. He asked, "Do they belong to the Celestial Wolf race?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded and explained, "The Celestial Wolf race was the designated one, and they were the first creatures to be born. According to the past rules, all the other creatures in this primitive land were nothing more than food for the Celestial Wolf race..."</p>

  <p>It was true that the designated race had been at the top of the food chain from the very beginning!</p>

  <p>As long as they were given enough time, they would become a ruling force sooner or later.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the creatures that were born in this round of chaos could only serve as the vassals of the Celestial Wolf race.</p>

  <p>This fate was determined from the reopening of the chaos. "Since the Celestial Wolf race had such a great advantage, how did they end up like today?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>In present times, the Celestial Wolf race was considered as an insignificant race.</p>

  <p>Even the Oneness Sky Palace could destroy them easily, let alone the Separate Abyss race, the Bearing race, or the other super forces.</p>

  <p>"Because they were in conflict with each other," the Snake Goddess calmly answered.</p>

  <p>"They? Who are they?" Zheng asked curiously. The Snake Goddess shook her head.</p>

  <p>"We don't know. Maybe 'they" refers to the Instant Civilization, or maybe not. I've been suspicious about things that haven't been proven to exist," she said and sighed.</p>

  <p>The Instant Civilization was widely recognized as the first civilization, which was the beginning of the chaos. It was difficult to understand and imagine.</p>

  <p>Yet, nobody had ever seen or known about this civilization...</p>

  <p>For such a kind of civilization, the Snake Goddess usually thought that it didn't exist.</p>

  <p>"I only know that they designated the Celestial Wolf race, but there have been conflicts within them, and they must be very disappointed in the Finale Way. After many rounds of civilizations and Finale Ways, we are now in the 1, 447th civilization and the 1, 447th chaos.</p>

  <p>Since they have wasted too much time, some of them got impatient and opened another passageway..." said the Snake Goddess as she looked at the continent.</p>

  <p>The continent was lush and filled with all kinds of creatures, but most of them belonged to the Celestial Wolf race which grew prosperous according to the original plan.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, different colored light dots, such as black, white, red, and so on, filled the sky.</p>

  <p>"They are the seeds of life. It's the races hiding on the Other Shore that scattered them everywhere through that passageway," said the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>The races on the Other Shore had always been interfering in the development of chaos, but their interference was limited. The intervention that could've happened at the greatest extent might be the Civilization Artifacts.</p>

  <p>It was different this time, however.</p>

  <p>At that point, they threw the members of their races into the real world.</p>

  <p>Then, seeds of life fell onto the ground, took root, and sprouted.</p>

  <p>There were Separate Abyss race, Moon Spirit race, Ear Mouse race, Sun Crow race, Cracked Earth race who were covered with poison and so on.</p>

  <p>"There has never been a chaos which contains so many races..." the Snake Goddess commented. Zheng simply nodded in response.</p>

  <p>These races had had a brilliant history and had been a ruling civilization in the past.</p>

  <p>Overall, they almost had the same potentials as each other.</p>

  <p>But, it wasn't until trillions of years of development that many of the super forces stood up to each other as equals.</p>

  <p>A small mountain slowly appeared in the illusion, and some white light dots fell upon it. One of the light dots gradually grew bigger and turned into a light cocoon of a few feet high. Afterwards, a naked woman with a snake tail walked out of the light cocoon.</p>

  <p>The woman with a snake tail looked exactly the same as the Snake Goddess, but she had no cultivation base at all. She was just an ordinary being. Her memories were blurry, which made her look puzzled.</p>

  <p>Naturally, both Zheng and Yan felt a little embarrassed at the sight of this woman.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess told them in a calm voice, "I am the first member of the Snake Goddess race to be born in this round of chaos, and Fuxi is the first human being."</p>
