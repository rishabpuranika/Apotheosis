<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3496 Cleon </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'This Libby should be the strongest warrior in the Land of Sword Grief…'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>His gaze swept across the names on the Ranking Stone. "I have a question."</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I can answer your question!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!"</p>

  <p>The veterans were entirely hospitable, each with their own axe to grind.</p>

  <p>"Can I challenge the warriors on the second floor?" Zheng asked flatly.</p>

  <p>The several hundred people on the first floor were shocked silent upon hearing the question.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with him?' many of them wondered.</p>

  <p>How dare he challenge the warriors on the second floor?</p>

  <p>Over 1, 100 people resided the entire Land of Sword Grief, and there were only about 200 people on the second floor. The strength of those who had reached the second floor was leaps and bounds beyond that of the first-floor cultivators.</p>

  <p>"According to the rules, you're not permitted to challenge anyone on the second floor," Abdul explained as he walked up to the Ranking Stone, pointing to a name on the list. "He is the only one qualified to do so."</p>

  <p>The name read Cleon. He was number one on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Excitement flashed across Feng Ge's eyes upon seeing Cleon's name. He was Jean's eldest son and Chance's brother— the guy who had been utterly defeated by Zheng as a cultivator at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>"I see." Zheng nodded slowly, pointing to the first name on the second floor.</p>

  <p>"That is to say, if I want to challenge someone on the third floor, I'd have to defeat the number one warrior on the second floor, right?"</p>

  <p>Apart from the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace who had just arrived along with Zheng, everyone else fell silent.</p>

  <p>Most of them stared at Zheng like he was an idiot.</p>

  <p>"Is he insane?"</p>

  <p>"How dare he even mention challenging someone on the third floor? Who does he think he is?"</p>

  <p>"I've been in the Land of Sword Grief for a long time. This is the first time I've seen a newcomer be this cocky."</p>

  <p>Completing the cultivation in the Chaotic Source Realm involved an extremely long process. The gap between the early, middle, and late stages of cultivation was undeniably wide— the three floors of the Land of Sword Grief represented such stages.</p>

  <p>People on the third floor rarely appeared— they were truly mysterious. Even those disciples who had been in the land for many years had never met them.</p>

  <p>Once those cultivators made a breakthrough, they had the potential to be chosen as the Oneness Governors at any given time— it was a chance to rise up the ranks and rule an entire place, like Athemar and Winchell.</p>

  <p>Rocco Zheng, who ranked first on the second floor had remained on top for many years. But after being defeated seven years prior, he never challenged anyone on the third floor again.</p>

  <p>Over 200 people occupied the second floor. Almost every month, they attempted to challenge Rocco and pull him down from the first place, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>But while Rocco had to suppress all the people on the second floor, no one from the third floor was interested in dueling with him.</p>

  <p>The difference in strength was just too great.</p>

  <p>And so everyone was ready to write Zheng off as a mere idiot.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, Zheng said, "I want to challenge this person."</p>

  <p>His finger was pointing to the topmost name on the first floor, Cleon.</p>

  <p>"What? You want to challenge Cleon?" Abdul practically convulsed.</p>

  <p>The others stared at Zheng in the same light, as they would look upon a monster.</p>

  <p>If Zheng won a fight against Cleon, he could challenge anyone on the second floor.</p>

  <p>The latter was the target of many duels, after all.</p>

  <p>But only by those within the top 30 on the first floor. Zheng had only entered the Land of Sword Grief. It was all too bold of him to declare a challenge against the first-ranker.</p>

  <p>People thought they might have heard wrong.</p>

  <p>But Zheng finally chose an opponent. Since he was courting death, the veterans didn't mind helping him.</p>

  <p>"Where is Cleon?"</p>

  <p>"He seems to be absent these days."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell him someone wants to challenge him. He'll come back, for sure!"</p>

  <p>At the beginning of every month, all disciples in the Land of Sword Grief stayed inside the building, waiting for challenges.</p>

  <p>But it was already midway through the month when some disciples weren't qualified to challenge others. Some direct descendants then chose to leave.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Cleon and his brother, Chance, had just left the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The moment they entered the Dragon City, the jade sword around Cleon's waist trembled, emitting a faint glow.</p>

  <p>As Cleon gently flicked the jade sword, a strange look came over his face.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Cleon?" Chance asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>"Someone wants to challenge me." Cleon's tone was curious.</p>

  <p>"You've been on top for the longest time. You must be used to being targeted," Chance returned with a smile.</p>

  <p>Only when the disciples defeated Cleon could they challenge those on the second floor. On the first floor, he was the most popular, to the point where he had to accept at least one challenge every month.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it's normal for anyone to challenge me now?" he asked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>After a moment, Chance clasped his hands together. "No. The month hasn't just started. They're not qualified to challenge you!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, the other nodded before continuing, "Feng Ge seems to have returned to the Phoenix Palace. The group of people heading to the Chaotic Source Realm should have returned by now."</p>

  <p>Chance's eyes widened in disbelief. "You mean… It's a newcomer who wants to challenge you?"</p>

  <p>Any new arrivals had the chance to challenge anyone upon entering the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>But generally, they fought against each other to earn their rankings. Rarely did anyone challenge veterans, even those of the lower ranks.</p>

  <p>"I believe so."</p>

  <p>Chance's expression looked unreadable. "How stupid can a newcomer be to challenge you right off the bat?"</p>

  <p>Throwing a nonchalant glance at Chance, Cleon answered, "I don't know if there is any such newcomer. I only know that a disciple from the Land of Sword Grief was defeated by a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace who hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm."</p>

  <p>What his brother said made Chance look grim. "That was an accident. That guy's Other Shore Token…"</p>

  <p>"Don't look down upon any enemy," Cleon interrupted him. "If I were you, I'd have been pulled down from the first place ages ago."</p>

  <p>Chance's defeat by Zheng's hands still brought him great shame. Because Jean had covered up the fact, only a few people were aware of it.</p>

  <p>"Come on, let's go back to the Land of Sword Grief," Cleon said, his eyes looking sharp and his mouth curling. "I'm rather curious about how talented this new guy is and why he dares to challenge me."</p>

  <p>Once they left the Dragon City, they headed straight for the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>For an hour, Zheng had waited on the first floor. News of the newcomer challenging Cleon spread quickly. More and more onlookers gathered around.</p>

  <p>Some disciples who were already out rushed back, and even those practicing in seclusion wanted to see who the arrogant new arrival was.</p>
