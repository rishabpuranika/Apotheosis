<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Konnor's words registered. Luo Zheng, taken aback, asked, "Doesn't the Divine Lair belong to the Jin Wu? How could the girl have been brought back from the Divine Lair?"</p>

  <p>"You might not know this, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi was once a good friend of Emperor Di Jun. They only became enemies later in life," explained Konnor, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Di Jun used to be on good terms.</p>

  <p>Because they had chosen different paths, their differences ended up destroying their friendship.</p>

  <p>"The Seven Mountains Meeting is to be held today. Let's not talk about this," whispered Konnor. "Among the descendants of all the mountains of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Feng Ge is one of the two beautiful ones."</p>

  <p>"Who is the other one?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Her name is Dorothy from Origin Mountain. She is the opposite of Feng Ge? lively and enthusiastic. She is very cute, as opposed to Feng Ge's cold demeanor," Konnor said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows in surprise. He didn't know Konnor thought so highly of Dorothy.</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge slowly made her way to her seat, the elites of the mountains stood up and saluted to her.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness!"</p>

  <p>"Greetings!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge remained cold and expressionless, as though she hadn't heard them.</p>

  <p>Ignoring everyone, she took the seat of honor on the front row.</p>

  <p>After Feng Ge took her seat, some other people arrived. It was three direct descendants of the Azure Mountain. The three young men curtly greeted their acquaintances and then took their seats.</p>

  <p>Other people followed. These were the direct descendants of Ivory Mountain and Golden Mountain.</p>

  <p>Once everyone had been seated, a voice suddenly chirped excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy! Long time no see!"</p>

  <p>Another voice followed suit. "Dorothy, I haven't seen you in two years!</p>

  <p>Your cultivation base has improved greatly!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around just in time to see Dorothy enter. She was wearing a dainty pink dress, which complemented her perfectly.</p>

  <p>She looked both vivacious and intelligent.</p>

  <p>She was not as arrogant as Feng Ge. She treated her friends the same and was popular in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and even the elite warriors were fond of her.</p>

  <p>If anyone dared to talk to Feng Ge in this chummy way, they would be in big trouble.</p>

  <p>Dorothy waved her hand at everyone in a friendly manner, then proceeded to strut to her seat.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Dorothy from Origin Mountain has arrived. I'll go and greet her."</p>

  <p>Konnor's eyes flashed excitedly as he said this.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy approached her seat, her head kept swiveling as she searched the tables for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She knew that, with Luo Zheng's abilities, he should be eligible to participate in the Seven Mountains Meeting. But it was probable he was unwilling to come.</p>

  <p>As she saw Konnor standing up from his seat, her eyes landed on what she was looking for. She smiled and approached them.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, nice to see you," Konnor said giddily, grinning from ear to ear.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected her to come to him.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded to him as a greeting. Then, she walked past him and sat directly next to Luo Zheng. Smiling at him, she cried, "I knew that you would come!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled calmly in return. "I was wondering if you would come."</p>

  <p>"Of course I would. The Seven Mountains Meeting is fun. And it takes place only once every three years. How could I have given up this opportunity?" Dorothy said with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

  <p>She punched him playfully.</p>

  <p>Konnor's jaw dropped to see her acting so casually with Luo Zheng. "You, you two know each other?"</p>

  <p>Konnor wasn't the only one who was shocked. At the other tables, the other elite disciples whispered amongst themselves, confused as to how they knew each other.</p>

  <p>Although Dorothy was easygoing, she was noble. She had never been so intimate with others.</p>

  <p>"Is it strange that we know each other?" Dorothy asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Konnor's face fell. With a bitter smile, he replied, "Nah, it's not..."</p>

  <p>All the other male warriors groaned internally at the sight of the beautiful Dorothy getting cozy with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, aloof to everything that was happening around her, immediately turned to Luo Zheng with a concerned look. "Have you merged with your Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then, how powerful are you now?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy asked.</p>

  <p>As they were whispering, another group of people entered the hall.</p>

  <p>"Marco is here."</p>

  <p>"This way, please!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>This group of people were from the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Marco, the man leading the group, was garbed in black robes, his eyes flashing energetically.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the forces of the Vastness Mountain had rapidly grown in strength. It used to be the weakest of the seven mountains; now, it was roughly on par with the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Marco beamed at the crowd as he strolled in, his teeth sparkling. When his gaze fell on Dorothy, his look softened. However, when he saw Luo Zheng seated next to her, his smile disappeared, his expression darkening.</p>

  <p>After returning from the Other Shore, Marco had sent someone to find out about Luo Zheng's background. The man had returned with very little information.</p>

  <p>Although he knew that Luo Zheng had entered the Dragon City before, and that he had been to the Heart Flow Sect, Marco knew nothing else about him.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, this kind of information should have been secretly kept by the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Apparently, someone had deliberately erased it.</p>

  <p>This didn't sit well with Marco. He decided he would definitely make trouble for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, now that Luo Zheng had become a disciple of the Heart Flow Sect, it would be difficult for Marco to deal with him. Even if he was the true son of the master of the Vastness Mountain, it would be a grave mistake for him to offend the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>His eyes flitted from Dorothy, to Luo Zheng, to Konnor, who sat next to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Marco was able to identify this mysterious figure next to Dorothy was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had been expecting to see him for a long time.</p>

  <p>Marco suddenly walked over to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Konnor bowed to him. "Marco, what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business. Get lost," said Marco coldly.</p>

  <p>Heads swiveled as everyone turned to watch the drama unfold.</p>

  <p>Recently, the Vastness Mountain had proposed an arranged marriage with the Origin Mountain. The latter had declined. This resulted in great tension between the two mountains. While they tried to keep this issue hush, everyone in the room knew about this matter.</p>

  <p>Even Feng Ge, who had been aloof this whole time, turned her head towards the commotion, her eyes narrowing in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Today is the Seven Mountains Meeting. I don't want to see you here. Get out of here!" Marco said to Luo Zheng in a boisterous and haughty tone.</p>

  <p>Dorothy rushed to Luo Zheng's defense. "Marco, how dare y? "</p>

  <p>"What if I don't want to get out of here?" Luo Zheng, remaining seated, calmly interrupted Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"You are in no position to say no!" A grim smile flickered across Marco's face, making him even more arrogant.</p>

  <p>When the others saw his expression, they all knew that the matter wouldn't end up well.</p>

  <p>Konnor, Mekhi and others exchanged glances anxiously.</p>

  <p>There were more than twenty of them from the Heart Flow Sect. Among them, Konnor, being in the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, was the strongest. Most of the others were in the eighth or ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm. Mekhi had reached the eleventh stage.</p>

  <p>But even Konnor didn't have the guts to offend Marco, the son of the master of the Vastness Mountain.</p>
