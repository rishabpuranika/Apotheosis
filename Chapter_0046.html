  <p>The tall young man from Wang Clan said, "Supervisor, I am an inner disciple of Cloud Sect and not a participant in the Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>"Inner disciple?" Joshua asked, "which peak?do you belong to?"</p>

  <p>"I am from the Skytop Peak, examiner," responded the tall young man.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, Master Xu of Skytop Peak is here too. Since you are an inner disciple, the punishment is that one hundred points will be deducted from the peak!" declared Joshua.</p>

  <p>There was a smile on the tall young man's face, and he looked relaxed. ?As everyone knew, one hundred points was a lot to the helpless grassroots, but for the noble clan disciples, it was nothing. Such a punishment was meaningless to him.</p>

  <p>They might have lost a hundred points, but Luo Luo Zheng would be kicked out of the Cloud Sect, which was precisely what they wanted.</p>

  <p>More than one thousand students stood there, looking angry about the unjust decision. This punishment was close to no punishment at all. Joshua was helping the influential.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all thirty-three peak masters in the Cloud Sect arrived on flying chariots.</p>

  <p>After the students passed the Blooded Test, each master would pick students who met their requirements. They would choose the right talents for their folds, based on the performances and examination results of the students.</p>

  <p>To have better development of their respective peaks, each master followed the principles of selecting the best students for their peaks.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng understood how bad his situation was. Joshua was obviously on the side of the noble clans. But, he continued to think that he didn't want to miss out on his life for something he had no control over. He argued,</p>

  <p>"Examiner, I wasn't the one who started the fight. You have to believe me.</p>

  <p>Everyone here saw it. I was forced into the fight. It's unfair to disqualify me from the competition arbitrarily like this!"</p>

  <p>"It's not fair? Now then, tell me, were you fighting?" Joshua had no expression as he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Luo Zheng responded honestly. He did fight, but, he was forced into it. If he hadn't, he would be dead now.</p>

  <p>"Okay then, we're all set! You don't need to say anymore. Just hand over your disciple card! And afterward, leave the Cloud Sect!" stated Joshua?as he extended his large hand for Luo Luo Zheng to hand over his disciple card.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took two steps back and in a positive tone said, "Examiner, it is unfair to punish me like this. I refuse to accept it, and I think there are more than one thousand students present who also refuse to accept it!"</p>

  <p>Joshua did not expect a humble temporary disciple would dare to speak to him like that, let alone question him. Who did he think he was talking to?</p>

  <p>Joshua raged. "How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Angered, he raised his hand to slap Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although Joshua?didn't use any internal strength or skills on his hand, the force alone was enough to severely hurt Luo Luo Zheng because Joshua had been at the nature level for many years, and his strength had surpassed the physical limit. One could imagine how destructive his hand was.</p>

  <p>Facing the possible force of Joshua's hand frightened Luo Luo Zheng, even if his body was a mysterious weapon, and would offset some of the power from the examiner, he was not indestructible. The strength of Joshua's hand was beyond what his body could bear. If he were hit, Luo Luo Zheng would be seriously injured.</p>

  <p>But just as Joshua was about to slap him, a clear voice was heard, "Joshua, what do you think you're doing?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Joshua turned in the direction of the voice and saw a beautiful woman wearing aqua blue standing not far away, looking over at them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remembered her well. He met her after he passed the initial exam yesterday.</p>

  <p>As angry as Joshua was, at the sight of her, he immediately calmed, and tried keeping an even tone as he explained, "Nothing special, just punishing a disciple for his unruly behavior."</p>

  <p>To Joshua, the woman in front of them was irritating, and once she caught wind of his failings, he would be in trouble. So, he didn't want to discuss this matter in depth with her, and just hoped this matter would be laid to rest here, silently.</p>

  <p>The fact of it was though, that Master Su had been watching for a while, and understood the cause and effect very well. She wouldn't care if it was another student Joshua?toyed with. Even if she was energetic, she could not go everywhere, minding others' business.</p>

  <p>But she did care very much that Joshua?was about to hit Luo Luo Zheng. She would not let that happen.</p>

  <p>Master Su chose Luo Luo Zheng early. Because she already regarded Luo Luo Zheng as the most prominent among the disciples recruited this year. 'You dare to touch my student? You will go through me first!' thought Master Su. Master Su would not allow Luo Luo Zheng to be attacked.</p>

  <p>"For his unruly behavior? Which rules did he break?" inquired Master Su.</p>

  <p>"He fought with another disciple here, which is a violation of the Cloud Sect regulations," replied Joshua in a quiet voice. He knew Master Su was here to save Luo Luo Zheng and knock him around at the same time.</p>

  <p>"I didn't start a fight with anyone. They attacked me! It's not my fault that I was forced to defend myself!" exclaimed Luo Luo Zheng, as he seized the opportunity to defend himself.</p>

  <p>In that instant, Joshua's facial expression changed, and he had the urge to hit?Luo Luo Zheng. However, Master?Su's cold voice from behind Joshua stilled his thoughts as she said, "Joshua, as an examiner, you should distinguish between right and wrong. Why didn't you give this student a chance to argue his side? What are you up to?"</p>

  <p>The sharp twinge in Master Su's voice struck Joshua's heart, and it felt far from ideal. Hearing the anger in her voice, Joshua realized he wasn't getting through this matter easily. Smiling complacently, Joshua said, "Master Su, it's such a small matter, surely it's not worth getting angry about......"</p>

  <p>"Well, if it's a small case, then let him clarify! You, tell all of us. What happened?" asked Master?Su.</p>

  <p>"They did it!" declared Luo Luo Zheng as he pointed to Billy, Perrin, and their followers. "They came at me with no reason. One of them rushed at me and hit me, forcing me to fight back!"</p>

  <p>Joshua sneered. "Young man, you'd better think over what you are saying.</p>

  <p>Your accusations are one-sided. Do you have anyone who can prove your tale?"</p>

  <p>Everyone stopped talking at once, and the noisy crowd suddenly became deathly quiet. A light smile spread across Billy's face, while Perrin gloated silently. They knew that the sons of the noble clans would not offend Billy, and among the more than one thousand disciples from ordinary families, if they were smart, none would stand up for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as expected, even though this happened in full view of all of them and they were outraged moments ago, none of them dared step forward and speak out for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Anyone who would stand up for Luo Luo Zheng would be a target of Billy's, and who would be stupid enough to risk getting his ass beaten? It made no sense to offend Billy without strength to back it.</p>

  <p>"I can prove it!"</p>
