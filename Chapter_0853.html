<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 853 The Highest Authority (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In that instant, Zheng utilized his comprehension on the general principles of the Transcendent Divine Might and subsequently channeled the power of the stars into his body.</p>

  <p>There happened to be a total of eight moves in the first part of the Stellar Body. According to what the red dragon had stated before, the eight moves in the first part corresponded with the eight Path Platforms.</p>

  <p>Every time Zheng managed to build a Path Platform, he would then be able to strike a move against his foe.</p>

  <p>However, as of the moment, Zheng had only unlocked only one Path Platform.</p>

  <p>It was a fortunate thing that the Hundred Meetings Platform corresponded to the first move of the Stellar Body, which was the "star shakes the earth"!</p>

  <p>If someone happened to take a glimpse of the sky, they would immediately observe that in the vast and distant darkness that stretched across the skies, a glowing star all of a sudden emitted an intense sort of bright starlight.</p>

  <p>From a great distance, the starlight which was initially the size of a speck of dust now appeared like a small pigeon egg. Needless to say, it seemed as if the light had magnified over a hundred times in an astonishingly short moment.</p>

  <p>This was the exceptional ability of the Stellar Body. Such an amazing power enabled any cultivator to absorb the force of the star into his own body and simply enhance the cultivator's own abilities.</p>

  <p>At the present, it was indeed a marvelous thing to see as Zheng's own body was enveloped in a faint glow reminiscent of starlight.</p>

  <p>Considering that he had only managed to be connected with one star thus far, the starlight that emitted from his frame was rather dim. Nonetheless, it would be significantly better if he were to be connected with more stars in order that the starlight around his body could gradually become brighter. In the end, the goal was to make him give the impression of a shining star!</p>

  <p>Realistically speaking, the power of the star condensed by the Stellar Body was fundamentally different from the star power formed by the Sun Moon Stars Picture. After all, the spiritual projection method of the Sun Moon Stars Picture presented him a more concrete and tangible feeling as the power needed to be obtained by relying on the act of visualizing the stars.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Stellar Body itself could directly utilize the real power of the star!</p>

  <p>Evidently, Zheng could not simply judge which method was better just by weighing their differences. This was due to the fact that the Stellar Body was known as the Transcendent Divine Might, while the Sun Moon Stars Picture was an inheritance from the fairy palace. Another palpable difference was that the former was a supreme unique technique for body refiners, whereas the latter represented the pinnacle of the life vitality system. Even though he had cultivated both these two skills, he could not easily mention which was better for him to use. Moreover, he had thought that both of these methods had great potential and that he ought to maximize their capabilities.</p>

  <p>Then again, he was currently located in the Sea God Continent and the desire to focus on his body refinement was still there. Therefore, it was ultimately necessary for him to experiment and assess the full power of the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>As soon as the starlight condensed around Zheng's form, he wasted no time at all as he suddenly charged towards his opponent.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Zheng did not have a single clue as to which level the owner of the Tower of Sin had reached in terms of strength--it was not something Zheng could simply guess or imagine. Furthermore, it was similar to that situation wherein he had no idea regarding the strength mobilized by the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace in the Genuine Dragon world. This was attributed to the untimely fact that they were both much more powerful than him and it was beyond his capabilities to figure out their cultivation levels.</p>

  <p>However, the kind of strength this person in front of him possessed did not matter to him at all, owing it to the fact that he had suppressed his cultivation level to that of a tenth level war fighter. With a determined expression on his face, Zheng was confident that he would be able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the movements of the person facing him, he noticed that his opponent's fist flashed with a hazy beam as his forceful energy continuously swirled and condensed, eventually forming a vortex at his fingertips. If he were not in this empty space, Zheng suspected that he could have been capable of absorbing every material thing in this world.</p>

  <p>As the vortex persistently absorbed the forceful energy and transformed it into a glowing beam of radiance that blanketed his fist, the man turned his head to glance at Zheng's frame with indifference painting his features. Upon noticing the faint light covering Zheng's body, he raised an eyebrow in surprise and said, "No wonder you are able to arrive at the stage of the ultimate test. I expected less from a mere human war fighter, but you actually possess the Transcendent Divine Might.." The man's voice faded away as if he was deep in thought before speaking up once again,</p>

  <p>"Furthermore, it seems to be the case that what you are using is the Transcendent Divine Might of Lord of Stars…"</p>

  <p>Just before that moment, Zheng had been saving up his strength and was prepared to strike the first move of the Stellar Body. Upon hearing the words the other man had uttered, he suddenly stopped in his tracks and hesitantly asked, "The Transcendent Divine Might of Lord of Stars?" "Who is that Lord of Stars?" he tilted his head to one side as he addressed his opponent.</p>

  <p>According to what the red dragon had explained to him before, he was not the one responsible for creating the Stellar Body. Because of this, the red dragon only retained the first part of the book with the additional warning to Zheng that the Stellar Body that he taught him was actually incomplete.</p>

  <p>Narrowing his eyes suspiciously at the other man, Zheng did not expect that the owner of the Tower of Sin was able to distinguish that the cultivation method he used was the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile that stretched across his lips, the man talked to him once more, "You are lucky to be able to possess the Transcendent Divine Might when you are merely a war fighter. As for your question, you have to find the answer yourself." he dramatically paused before looking at him in challenge. "If you want to pass the ultimate test, you have to resist my punch first."</p>

  <p>As soon as he had finished speaking, the man clenched his fist in preparation. The moment he tightened his grip, the meridians on his fist bulged on one by one. In normal circumstances, a human's meridians would appear to take on a greenish hue, but this man was certainly not ordinary as his meridians reflected the color of a brilliant gold.</p>

  <p>"Celestial Position Devour!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>Within the span of a second, the forceful energy that the man harbored for a long time suddenly erupted. Although the man had lowered himself to a tenth level war fighter, the power that exuded from the man still shocked Zheng and left him speechless.</p>

  <p>The reason why Zheng momentarily halted his offensive move just now was because he was curious about the origin of the Stellar Body and he wanted to ask the other man what he knew about it. Judging from the way the man spoke and replied to his inquiries, it was crystal clear to Zheng just then that he did not plan to discuss it with him. Huffing to himself, Zheng promptly dropped the matter and went all out to strike his move.</p>
