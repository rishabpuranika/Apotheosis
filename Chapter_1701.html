  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't stop, not even after he'd killed all the beasts.</p>

  <p>He did not have any misgivings after cutting off his emotions and desires. All he cared about now was the sword in his hand...</p>

  <p>He still hadn't fully attained the Godly Way, though.</p>

  <p>Shania placed the Staff of Life in front of her that spread out an invisible force all around.</p>

  <p>At that moment, even though he had already broken free from the entanglement of fear, Zheng had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid to die, but that didn't mean he was willing to throw his life away so easily.</p>

  <p>Shania smiled at him. She wasn't in any real hurry to kill him. Right now, her focus was at the outside of the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, she wasn't looking at her opponent, but at the audience outside the painting.</p>

  <p>She opened her mouth and her soft voice rang out.</p>

  <p>This painting could be considered as a special kind of Roaring Token given that it was broadcasted all over the Illusion Spaces in the universe.</p>

  <p>Shania's voice could only resound around the Illusion Spaces, so only those who were watching the fight could hear her. And, they could also see her.</p>

  <p>"Take a good long look, you old fellows. You keep talking about heavens' limitation but watch how I break it..."</p>

  <p>Her words were directed to those Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>A lot of these mighty Supreme Lords had long since figured out her identity. Shania herself knew that it would be impossible for her to hide from such powerful people, so she didn't even try.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were a bit confused at her words. She could only be talking about them when she said "old fellows." What exactly was she trying to do?</p>

  <p>"Heavens' limitation..."</p>

  <p>In Mist Palace, Supreme Lord Healum revealed a look of surprise.</p>

  <p>Even Yolande herself gasped. "She wants to tell everyone that she can break heavens' limitation?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum nodded.</p>

  <p>"I guess it's possible. Is it?" He wasn't sure. Even he felt extremely conflicted at what was currently happening.</p>

  <p>The heavens' limitation was the biggest restriction imposed in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>All living creatures were subject to this limitation. Everyone had a certain threshold for their power.</p>

  <p>It was only the Godly Geniuses who had the ability to overcome the current round of heavens. Only after the Mahayana Lotus Flower was fully activated would one be able to cross the current round and become a True God.</p>

  <p>There were so few Godly Geniuses in the universe.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord couldn't know exactly how many creatures had been born in the universe for the past hundred million years. Yet among those creatures, not even one Godly Genius could be found.</p>

  <p>The birth of a Godly Genius was something that happened only once in a few hundred million years.</p>

  <p>There was an influx of ace talents because of the oncoming chaos this world was about to face, but the Godly Geniuses were still small in number.</p>

  <p>None of the existing Supreme Lords were Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>After a Supreme Lord took on the Heavenly Destiny, his Lotus Flower would stabilize and refuse to bloom ever again.</p>

  <p>Tens of millions of years ago, Supreme Lord Healum managed to bloom 33 petals. This number would still remain the same even now.</p>

  <p>He had long since lost the chance to cross the heavens.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. All the other Supreme Lords had also given up this chance.</p>

  <p>The world lords had a small sliver of hope, but this was a really tiny sliver.</p>

  <p>There was one person who could cross the heavens despite being a Supreme Lord, and that was Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>However, this fact wasn't something that was known to everyone.</p>

  <p>Whether or not he used the Emotion Closing Godly Way to break through the boundary was a different secret altogether.</p>

  <p>Shania's remark caught the attention of all Supreme Lords watching.</p>

  <p>Ying was someone who was willing to give everything up for reincarnation. It was desperate people like her that often discovered strange, mysterious ways to mess with the rules of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Did she truly have a way to break heavens' limitation?</p>

  <p>"Whatever you do, we'll just have to wait and see," an old man of the Celestial Position mumbled.</p>

  <p>Nobody wanted to be bound, but only a few had the ability to break free.</p>

  <p>Ying pointed the Staff of Life on the ground.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p>

  <p>The instant the staff touched the ground, a burst of green appeared on the greyish white Heaven Earth Board. The color quickly spread out until it covered the entire board.</p>

  <p>From this burst of green was life: flowers, plants, and trees all rapidly grew, painting the entire board with vitality.</p>

  <p>The grass spread across Zheng's knees and a strange expression appeared on his wooden face.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed danger, but what Shania just did went over his head. He couldn't figure out what she was up to.</p>

  <p>"This is much more pleasing to the eyes," Shania said. Her words were not only for Zheng but also for the Supreme Lords who watched them.</p>

  <p>"After I reached the ninth layer of the Life Law, I couldn't advance no matter how hard I tried."</p>

  <p>The ninth layer of the Life Law had only one profound mystery: reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Shania could reincarnate, not only herself, but others as well.</p>

  <p>Reincarnation was different from resurrection. While the latter was mostly raising someone up from the dead, reincarnation entailed using up all of one's cultivation until only memory remained.</p>

  <p>She wasn't a Supreme Lord, so she could only cultivate the Life Law until this degree.</p>

  <p>The only way to advance was to bear the Heavenly Destiny associated with the Life Law.</p>

  <p>Shania smiled. "I've tried, but there is just an insurmountable limitation in every direction. I believe you all know what I'm talking about."</p>

  <p>All powerful warriors trained themselves in order to get to a higher level of power.</p>

  <p>To the Supreme Lords, things such as wealth, women, and power were extremely banal. None of them could even be bothered to pursue any of these vices.</p>

  <p>The universe was not so big anymore when you were a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Their lives were not as loaded with adventure. Numerous secrets existed in many secret lands, just waiting to be decoded, but most of these mysteries were negligible to Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The reason they existed was to explore a world they did not know about</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>"I know you have all failed. However, I will soon succeed..."</p>

  <p>Shania continued, obviously eager to share with them her discoveries.</p>

  <p>Here in this painting, she readily displayed her true strength to the entire universe.</p>

  <p>The next second, a green spiral began to appear around her. A gentle breeze also blew, causing the grass and trees to sway gently.</p>

  <p>There was absolutely no killing intent within the aura she currently exhibited.</p>

  <p>Instead, a surge of majestic life energy burst from Shania's body and soared into the sky!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The force caused her long, curly hair to dance in the wind, like a Goddess of Life incarnate!</p>

  <p>Even Zheng himself was amazed at the sight.</p>

  <p>Shania looked down and smiled sweetly at Zheng. "Let me borrow you for a moment," she said.</p>

  <p>She then pointed at him.</p>

  <p>There was nothing out of the ordinary at first.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as she pointed at him, numerous green balls appeared on top of the staff.</p>

  <p>The balls were about the size of a fist and rolled down onto the ground.</p>

  <p>These balls were actually powerful spheres that contained the strongest Life Law in the universe— the ninth level of the Life Law.</p>

  <p>"What is Shania trying to do?"</p>

  <p>"She seems to have used reincarnation on Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Ying is the only one who can reach the ninth level of Life Law.</p>

  <p>However, there is still a limit to reincarnation. Shouldn't she use Zheng's body as a medium to reincarnate?"</p>

  <p>None of the Supreme Lords trained up to the ninth level of the Life Law, but they still more or less knew what was happening.</p>

  <p>If she wanted to reincarnate Zheng, then she would have to kill him first.</p>

  <p>What exactly was Shania doing?</p>

  <p>The surface of the first ball began to expand and take form.</p>

  <p>The green sphere of power grew until it reached the height of a person. It stretched and bulged constantly as the organs and features slowly came to light: spine, lungs, heart, muscles, hair, and skin...</p>

  <p>Once fully formed, a person who looked exactly like Zheng stood beside Shania.</p>

  <p>Even with his impeccable eye, Zheng couldn't find any sort of difference between the real him and this clone Shania just created.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that this clone wasn't wearing any clothes...</p>

  <p>"Ah, shame..." Margaret was really uncomfortable. She couldn't bear seeing her husband naked like this.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>How could there be such an identical version of him?</p>

  <p>He had already encountered this situation in a magic array, but that was only an illusion. The clone that was in front of him was real flesh and blood. Shania actually recreated a new him.</p>

  <p>She was … creating creatures!</p>
