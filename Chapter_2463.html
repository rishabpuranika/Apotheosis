</p>

  <p>"We exist because of them," Edmond said as he glanced at the mist in the distance. "That's the truth. We were created by a strange method with the only purpose of killing those True Gods."</p>

  <p>"In other words, it's safe to say that all this is nothing more than a basic trial for top-rank True Gods. Then, we..." Atlas suddenly frowned and stopped speaking.</p>

  <p>"Creating a creature that has all the memories is something even a Holy Being can't do." Edmond thought for a brief moment before continuing,</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in those guys. Take me to find the Multiple Antennae Snake so I can swallow it. After that, we'll find a way to leave this place!"</p>

  <p>Once Edmond and Atlas gained their chance of rebirth, their ultimate goal was to obtain absolute freedom and never to be controlled by others again.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know though, was that their efforts were in vain.</p>

  <p>At the end of the debate venue, on the huge iron bridge, a woman with long hair could be seen strolling.</p>

  <p>Every hair of hers was glowing with a strange luster and it poured toward the bottom of the bridge, all while slowly floating with the gentle wind.</p>

  <p>So far, in all its existence, no one had ever crossed the iron bridge.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the Sword Clan had made it through the debate venue twice, and yet, they were still blocked by the iron bridge.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, as an incarnation of fear, this woman wasn't qualified to cross the iron bridge, either.</p>

  <p>Despite all that, there she was, walking along the iron bridge, completely safe and sound.</p>

  <p>After she crossed over the iron bridge, she disappeared into a small cave.</p>

  <p>The cave wall, on the other hand, was full of observant, curious eyes. As she entered, all the eyes swiveled and rolled in her direction.</p>

  <p>She kept an indifferent look on her face and moved along.</p>

  <p>She stopped, and at her feet, a deep well appeared. The aura that it exuded was extremely strong. So much so, in fact, that one could presume that the aura throughout the Non-combat Zone was flowing out of this well.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation, the woman jumped down into the well.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>She landed loudly on her two feet. The well was only about a hundred feet in height, and she reached the bottom in an instant.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the well, a skeleton held a long sword. He had maintained his sitting posture all this time.</p>

  <p>"Harper," the long haired woman called out in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The skeleton sat still on the ground. He was motionless and had no reaction whatsoever. He was just a pile of bones.</p>

  <p>"Are you really dead?" The long haired woman asked, staring at the skeleton.</p>

  <p>"A powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm holds a detached attitude to the past as well as to the future. You aren't easy to kill off. Stop pretending. Just say something!" the long haired woman frowned as she spoke even louder now.</p>

  <p>The skeleton though, still remained motionless.</p>

  <p>The long haired woman couldn't help but curl the bones at the skeleton's sternum. She did so with a slight flick of her hair. Her only intentions now were to drag the skeleton out.</p>

  <p>When she yanked, the chances were that the skeleton would be pulled to pieces.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a faint yellow light flashed through the skeleton's hollow eyes. What was more, the bones that made his body began to creak and crack.</p>

  <p>A pair of skinny bone hands quickly grasped the wisp of hair. The skeleton opened his mouth slightly, from which came an ethereal voice. "Don't pull me. Stop! My old bones can't be yanked in such a violent way!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you just answer me earlier, then?" The long haired woman asked expressionlessly and rather annoyed. As soon as she finished speaking, the wisp of black hair quickly withdrew and returned to her head.</p>

  <p>She then immediately asked, "Whose fear incarnation am I?"</p>

  <p>The long haired woman hadn't shown up for many, many divine eras now.</p>

  <p>She was so direct with the skeleton because becoming a fear incarnation was in fact extremely rare.</p>

  <p>The skeleton was silent for a moment, and then replied coldly, "You're quite a smart individual. You should be capable of figuring that out on your own, right?"</p>

  <p>The long haired woman lowered her head to look at the ground, and remained silent for a short while. Then, she nodded.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since she appeared in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Only a select few people knew of her existence there.</p>

  <p>She'd met the young man a few years ago through the eye of a Spiritual Crow in an underground world.</p>

  <p>"Am I really that scary?" The long haired woman questioned, resentfully.</p>

  <p>The skeleton smiled faintly and then said, "Of course you aren't scary! That said though, if I were to see a woman who looks exactly like my sister, I'm afraid to say that I'd definitely feel shocked."</p>

  <p>"Sister!?" the long haired woman exclaimed as she frowned anew.</p>

  <p>The skeleton nodded his skull up and down. "Both he and his sister have come. You're their mother. Why don't you go meet them? Why have you come here to meet me instead?"</p>

  <p>The skeleton pointed out toward the distance.</p>

  <p>The wall on the opposing side of the deep well began to move and spread out like ripples.</p>

  <p>On the screen, Luo Zheng could be seen leading a group of people through the mist.</p>

  <p>"He's very intelligent. He's already discovered the method for breaking through the debate venue. Perhaps he really can obtain all of my inheritance." The skeleton's words revealed a hint of appreciation.</p>

  <p>The long haired woman said nothing but fixed her eyes on the screen. A tinge of sadness washed over her and settled in her eyes. "I... I didn't even spend an entire day with them."</p>

  <p>"The situation at the time didn't allow you to do so. It's not your fault. Back in the day, I truly thought Mike had acted rashly when he placed Luo Zheng and Yan in his inner world. Now though, I can admit that I may have been wrong," the skeleton said flatly. "Mike has made something impossible possible. That said, he's also had to pay a heavy price for the latter."</p>

  <p>Hearing what the skeleton was saying, the long haired woman showed a relaxed face and smiled faintly. "Although you have been an Other Shore Realm powerhouse and have reached a higher level of life, you might not be smarter than my husband. He's still much more far-sighted than you are!"</p>

  <p>"Far-sighted? So what? Who cares?" The skeleton shook his skull. "It's too late. It's too late for Luo Zheng and Yan to obtain my inheritance. We have been falling for too long now. We've arrived in the depth of pure chaos. The ship has already been targeted by the Out-of-Land Fiends."</p>

  <p>"The Out-of-Land Fiends? What do you mean by that?" The woman with long hair frowned as she asked her question.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've never seen them myself before. The chaos is just too huge. There aren't many records of the Out-of-Land Fiends in the Source World, but I've already noticed their existence," the skeleton replied. "And even without the existence of the Out-of-Land Fiends, you still wouldn't have any chances at winning!"</p>

  <p>"Ah. I believe them," the long haired woman said calmly as she kept her composure.</p>

  <p>"I hope so. But I'm afraid it's hard to say whether or not Luo Zheng and Yan will get through this. They have made the right decision, but the fiend has equally made the same choice." The skeleton pointed to the picture displayed on the well wall.</p>

  <p>As she listened to him speak, the long haired woman felt utterly shocked.</p>

  <p>Earlier, she had felt suspicious about whether she was the fear incarnation that Luo Zheng had created.</p>

  <p>Now though, she'd confirmed that both Luo Zheng and Yan were located in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>How could they even fight against the fiend?</p>

  <p>She felt extremely anxious about protecting her children.</p>

  <p>"I should have killed him right away!"</p>

  <p>The long haired woman wore a murderous look on her face. In a flash, she jumped out of the deep well and quickly crossed back over the iron bridge.</p>
