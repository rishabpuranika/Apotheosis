<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The old man was going to leave with Luo Zheng, but the elders of the Sword House followed them.</p>

  <p>They were puzzled as to how Luo Zheng entered the cave alone but came out with an old man.</p>

  <p>What was more, they could sense that the old man was powerful. But who was he? Why and how did he show up in the forbidden area of the Sword Manor?</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, did you see Master Bi?" someone inquired.</p>

  <p>"Master Bi?" Luo Zheng shook his head and lied, "No, I didn't see him."</p>

  <p>"That's strange. We haven't seen him since he left."</p>

  <p>"Could he have entered the Killing Sword Mountain?"</p>

  <p>"The Killing Sword Mountain is a forbidden area. How could Master Bi violate the rule?"</p>

  <p>Hearing their discussion, a faint sneer played on Zheng's face as he thought, 'Hah! Your Master Bi was sentenced to life imprisonment.'</p>

  <p>It appeared that the warriors of the Sword Manor didn't know that Finch had entered the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>While they were still discussing this, one of the two world lords of the Sword Manor stared at the old man and asked, "May I ask who you are and why you showed up in the forbidden area of our Sword Manor?"</p>

  <p>These two world lords were also in charge of the Sword Manor, second-in-command after Finch.</p>

  <p>According to Sword Chen's order, no one was allowed to enter the Killing Sword Mountain except the one with the Whispering Sword. If the old man came out of the Killing Sword Mountain, it meant that he had disobeyed the rule.</p>

  <p>But these two world lords were knowledgeable.</p>

  <p>After all, they could tell this old man might be one of the Supreme Lords. No matter which Supreme Lord he was, they didn't have the power to fight him, so even though they had asked politely, if he was unwilling to tell them, they could do nothing.</p>

  <p>If the old man was not powerful, they would have taken action.</p>

  <p>Facing the world lords' question, the old man did not seem to mind. He smiled and said, "Something has been triggered in the universe, so I have to come here to take Luo Zheng away."</p>

  <p>"Take Luo Zheng away?" asked a bewildered world lord.</p>

  <p>"No, you can't do that!"</p>

  <p>Both the world lords immediately shouted in panic. The faces of the elders present also grew serious.</p>

  <p>They had discussed all of last night and arrived at a decision.</p>

  <p>Finch had announced that whether or not Luo Zheng obtained Supreme Lord Sword's heritage, he would be the new leader of the Sword Manor. And they would make him stay in the Sword Manor whether or not he accepted it, even if they had to force him.</p>

  <p>Everyone agreed with this decision.</p>

  <p>They naturally didn't know that Finch had planned on not letting Luo Zheng leave the forbidden area alive. If Luo Zheng died there, Finch would have told everyone that he encountered some trouble and died in a trap. He would then shed crocodile tears and proceed to take Supreme Lord Sword's heritage away and retain his position.</p>

  <p>Two world lords stepped forward.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Sword House also blocked Luo Zheng and the old man.</p>

  <p>Even if the old man was really a Supreme Lord, they would stop them in order to keep Luo Zheng from getting away.</p>

  <p>One of the world lords bowed slightly and said, "Luo Zheng has the Whispering Sword, so he is the new leader of our Sword Manor. You can't just take him away. That's not fair!"</p>

  <p>The old man looked at him indifferently and said, "You want Luo Zheng to take charge of the Sword Manor?"</p>

  <p>The world lord nodded, looking calm. He knew he was no match for the old man. The warriors of the Sword Manor would die fighting but never step back.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled wryly as he shook his head. He stared at the world lord and said, "May I ask you a question? The future of the entire universe and your small Sword Manor, which one is more important?"</p>

  <p>Both of the world lords' faces grew even more serious, and the elders too were dumbfounded. After a while, someone in the crowd spoke, "The future of the universe depends on Supreme Lords like you. But our Sword Manor has lost its Supreme Lord..."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I am saying." The old man continued icily, "The Sword Manor is no longer important. What is important is the thing left by Sword Chen. I don't have much time. Luo Zheng has to go with me right now."</p>

  <p>He was about to leave with Luo Zheng, and Freya followed them closely.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the world lords still wanted to stop them, the old man shot them a stern glance, and they found that they could not move, nor could anybody else. It felt like they were being controlled by an extremely powerful force. Two Baleful Celestial Hounds nearby also curled up in terror.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," said the old man as he dragged Luo Zheng and stepped forward. A footprint made by a bright white light appeared on the ground followed by many others. The footprints became denser and denser. Luo Zheng had been walking in a cave, but after he walked for a while, the scene around him became more and more blurry as if the walls of the cave were coated in a white light film. At last, the cave disappeared, and he entered a bright white channel.</p>

  <p>Exiting this channel, Luo Zheng found that he had entered an unknown space.</p>

  <p>"Spatial transference," he murmured.</p>

  <p>The spatial transference was a skill used for traveling long distances in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>The higher the level of the cultivation was, the farther the distance one could cover. So the distance a Supreme Lord could travel was much more than a world lord could.</p>

  <p>But this skill was not comparable to Zheng's Teleportation Token. Using the Teleportation Token, Luo Zheng could arrive anywhere in the universe swiftly. The old man took Luo Zheng and left the space to the next place. After he did that a dozen times, they finally arrived at their destination half a day later.</p>

  <p>Compared to other forces, the area occupied by the Celestial Position race was smaller. They only possessed three supreme worlds, which was less than even a second-rate force.</p>

  <p>However, no one dared to belittle the Celestial Position race. Everyone knew that it would play extremely an important role when facing this round of crisis.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had asked the old man many questions, but he did not answer any of them. He only told Luo Zheng that according to the deduction, Nathan should be the one to receive the Whispering Sword, and he was also the one who should win the final battle of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>However, an unexpected situation occurred when Luo Zheng took away what originally belonged to Nathan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was annoyed about what the old man said and he wondered why it had to be Nathan who got these things. That guy had been acting strangely and had spoken nonsense on the board, so why would the old man also do so?</p>

  <p>"Last time I asked you to go to the Celestial Position race because I hoped you would not get involved in it and come 11th in the Illusion Battlefield," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth would I do that?" Luo Zheng got more annoyed. Everyone had the right to attain a higher position in martial arts. He had no reason to give up competing with others.</p>

  <p>The old man answered apathetically, "There is no reason. If you did so, it would be good for the entire universe. At last we had to replace you with Xenia. That's why she lost to Tianming and was eliminated before she entered the top ten."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Are you saying that Xenia deliberately lost to Tianming? She intentionally didn't enter the top 10?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a great impression on Xenia because she had the same page of Sanskrit as him.</p>

  <p>After entering the top 10, Luo Zheng found it strange that the situation was not normal. The Celestial Position race had so many talents, then how could it be that only Karl entered the top 10. What was more, Karl had been eliminated before he could enter the top 5. The performances of the talents from the Celestial Position race did not correspond with their fame.</p>

  <p>The old man's face remained emotionless seeing Zheng's baffled reaction, as though this was how it was meant to be. He said flatly, "You young fellows are truly gifted, but you are still too naive. Many things have higher meanings and they are not just as what you can see on the surface.</p>

  <p>The ultimate truth of the world..."</p>

  <p>"What's the ultimate truth?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was overwhelmed with all this information. After the Illusion Battlefield ended, he felt that everything had changed. It seemed that everyone was hiding something from him, and he was the only one who knew nothing about it.</p>

  <p>"It'll depress you. One day you will know it." The old man continued,</p>

  <p>"Now that you have joined the Celestial Position race, I will heal your hands first. Then I will change your blood and restore Xun's soul. If she needs, we can give her a female body."</p>

  <p>"To be honest, I'd like to know the truth of the world first," Luo Zheng said, looking upset.</p>

  <p>However, the old man blatantly ignored his request.</p>

  <p>To join the Celestial Position race, the first thing one must do was to change one's blood.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng's hands were severely damaged, they decided to postpone the change of blood and repair his hands first.</p>

  <p>Helping Luo Zheng regrow the flesh and blood was not difficult, but it was not easy to get a perfect recovery.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was put in the center area of the Celestial Position race. The icy blue palace was beside a peaceful lake with tall cedars dotting the lake shore.</p>

  <p>It was a quiet area.</p>

  <p>"The scenery is beautiful," Freya said with a smile as she stared into the distance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not interested in the wonderful scenery at all. He was thinking about what he was going to face later. The Celestial Position race seemed to have some plan, and according to what the old man said, Nathan was involved in it. But Zheng's appearance had upset their plan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng speculated that the Celestial Position race must have joined hands with the Thoughtless Minds, or maybe even other forces. It was not a tough guess to make. This crisis would engulf the entire universe, with no exception. So all conflicts were meaningless, and what they needed to do was to come together and survive the crisis.</p>

  <p>While he was still contemplating all this, the scene that unfolded in front of him in the next moment confirmed his speculation.</p>

  <p>He spotted Tianming and Xenia walking side by side toward him from the lake shore.</p>
