<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 37 Passing The Initial Exam(Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>He knew from his earlier encounter that these men wouldn't give up easily.</p>

  <p>Straining his muscles to prepare against any potential attacks, Luo Zheng kept heading towards the next stone tablet. As he drew closer to the four men, a young man dressed as a scholar approached him, putting up his hand for Luo Zheng to stop. "Guy, you don't need to continue. Your initial exam is completed."</p>

  <p>The scholar's words were no-nonsense, but Luo Zheng was surprised when they didn't attack him directly. Assessing the situation, Luo Zheng decided to pretend to know nothing about their purpose and asked, "Why is my exam over? Who asked you to stop me here?"</p>

  <p>Chuckling, the scholar said, "I don't see any reason to answer your questions. All you need to know is that this is the end of the initial exam for you. You shouldn't get your hopes up. The Cloud Sect is not a place for people like you."</p>

  <p>Usually, facing four marrow refining level adversaries, one should be scared. Even people at the top of organ refining level couldn't compare to rivals who had reached the marrow refining level. Therefore, the four men considered Luo Zheng an easy target.</p>

  <p>Not hearing any answers, Luo Zheng was trying to think of how he could escape the four men. But his expression and stance didn't give that away. Instead, he continued to pretend not to understand what the scholar meant, his face gloomy and he murmured, "But, I haven't passed my initial exam, yet. What should I do about that?"</p>

  <p>"That's your problem!" declared the scholar as the four men glared mockingly at Luo Zheng. The four of them exchanged glances, thinking, 'The boy is foolish if he still thinks he will pass the initial exam! Is he dreaming?'</p>

  <p>While the men were busy glancing at each other, Luo Zheng stared up into the sky behind them and cried out, "Ah, look, here's an examiner coming now, on a flying chariot!"</p>

  <p>Since the examiners at the Cloud Sect deterred most of the disciples from breaking the rules, Luo Zheng knew the four men would be afraid to attack him in front of the examiners. So, when Luo Zheng shouted happily, they automatically turned to see the chariot.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Luo Zheng rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Summoning every bit of his energy, he shot forward, like an arrow released from a bow. Almost instantly, he passed his attackers, rushing at the stone tablet in sight.</p>

  <p>The four men looked back at an empty sky. There was no flying chariot or any examiners. They whipped their heads back, only to find Luo Zheng was no longer standing there.</p>

  <p>Realizing Zheng's trickery, the faces of the four men contorted angrily, and they chased after Luo Zheng, shouting abusively.</p>

  <p>"Sneaky simpleton!"</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can outrun us?"</p>

  <p>"Cut his legs when we catch him! Without legs, he won't escape!"</p>

  <p>With the evil expletives coming from behind, Luo Zheng smiled faintly and then turned a deaf ear. He drove his whole body to the limit and pushed himself forward madly.</p>

  <p>Only about one mile stood between Luo Zheng and the stone. He was sprinting into the stone tablet. With the top speed, he would just need to take a few breaths.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng was fast, the men chasing him weren't slow. Especially the scholar, whose body had a blue light shining and feet moving like thunder. What kind of skill was the scholar refining? His speed was far faster than Zheng's, and the scholar was running close to Luo Zheng quickly.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, simple man. You are barely at the organ refining level. How dare you try to trick us? In the face of absolute strength, your plot is nothing!</p>

  <p>Taste my Toxic Smoky Palm! And go to hell!" The scholar criticized, lunging at Zheng's back. A green light flashed from his hands, as he reached out and smacked Luo Zheng firmly on the back.</p>

  <p>A full force strike from someone at the marrow refining level was monstrous.</p>

  <p>The Toxic Smoky Palm didn't just knock the wind out of him but also released green smoke into Zheng's body, which was so toxic that it would kill an elephant immediately if the elephant inhaled a puff of this green smoke.</p>

  <p>This smoke, however, was shot right into Zheng's bloodstream.</p>

  <p>"Ha! My toxic smoke has hurt you. You won't be able to run now and will fall to the ground soon." The scholar proudly bragged about his victorious blow to Luo Zheng, and stopped, expecting Luo Zheng to drop to the ground.</p>

  <p>As he watched, he realized the scene he had imagined wasn't going to happen.</p>

  <p>"H--how, How come he is still running? How is it possible?" stammered the scholar, with his eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>He had summoned all his energy to make the blow just now. With his strength at the marrow refining level, he should have smashed Zheng's body into pieces. Not to mention the toxic smoke from his palm.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng continue like that as though he wasn't affected by the scholar's toxic palm at all? He was running ahead as if he hadn't been poisoned! As a matter of fact, he sped up after the scholar pushed him!</p>

  <p>'What kind of monster is he?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The four people froze, staring at each other, mouths agape, with shocked looks on their faces. They had never seen anyone could survive the toxic smoky palm strike.</p>

  <p>Contrary to what should happen, at the moment, Luo Zheng was very comfortable, and his body felt warm all over.</p>

  <p>After Evil Lan's fire refined his body, the strength of Zheng's body had significantly risen.</p>

  <p>It was nearly impossible for a warm current to occur when people at the bone or organ refining levels battered him.</p>

  <p>Only after he was beaten by people at the level of marrow refining would Luo Zheng feel the warm current course through his body again.</p>

  <p>Just now, when his enemy used the toxic smoky palm to attack him, Luo Zheng felt the warm current flow through him, and as it washed over his nervous system, his breathing improved, as if he ate a Magic Pill.</p>

  <p>As for the poison of the scholar's palm, it did not cause him any harm. His body was like a mysterious weapon. Naturally, all toxins were harmless.</p>

  <p>Who had heard of a mysterious weapon harmed by poison?</p>

  <p>Opportunities were rare. Luo Zheng wanted to stop and let them beat him up when he thought about how being thrashed by four people at the marrow refining level could help wash his internal organs.</p>

  <p>However, the stone tablet was just ahead, and if he was right, it should be the goal for the organ refining level. As soon as he reached the stone tablet, Luo Zheng would pass the initial exam.</p>

  <p>'It would be better for me to turn jade pendant red and pass the initial exam first, before any other unexpected things occur, ' thought Luo Zheng. He dismissed the idea of stopping to be beaten by the four people and ran straight to the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Although the four men pursued Luo Zheng desperately, they could only watch him pass the stone in a few seconds because of how close he was to it.</p>
