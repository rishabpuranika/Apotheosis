  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was intimidatingly high, as though it was touching the sky.</p>

  <p>However, the moment someone entered it, they would not be able to tell they were inside a hill.</p>

  <p>The hill itself was huge? so huge that it sloped ever so gently.</p>

  <p>The people living on the Li Shan mountain sometimes felt as though they lived on a plain rather than on a hill.</p>

  <p>The woman of the Snake Goddess race was leading the way, with Luo Zheng at her heel.</p>

  <p>After passing through two transmission arrays on the way, he was suddenly shrouded in a thick mist.</p>

  <p>The mist blocked the flow of his spiritual sense, so he couldn't see anything in front of him. Cautiously, he followed the woman on the climb all the way up into the clouds.</p>

  <p>There, he saw a huge jadeite platform floating in the air. Upon stepping onto the platform, the woman saluted to Luo Zheng curtly. "Please wait here."</p>

  <p>Standing on the jadeite platform, Luo Zheng could see the whole Pear Province before him.</p>

  <p>Although, it was a bit hazy, with the thick clouds blocking the view.</p>

  <p>Similar to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Li Shan mountain had a few mountain leaders who managed several grand sect leaders. There were more than one hundred sect leaders under the command of the grand sect leaders. Emily was the leader of the Rose Sect.</p>

  <p>After around five minutes of waiting, Luo Zheng sensed a space wave coming from behind him. As he turned to look, Yan popped out from a space channel.</p>

  <p>"Brother!" she cried gleefully, hopping forward to hug Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just then, a beautiful woman emerged from the same space channel.</p>

  <p>Wearing a purple gown, she looked like royalty. Her eyes revealed a sense of wisdom and experience.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had created many miracles in the Source World. Her two notably important contributions were the Grand World Cultivation Method and the Chaotic Source Spirits. It could be said that she singlehandedly nudged the whole world towards progress.</p>

  <p>Staring at the elegant woman before him, Luo Zheng was slightly taken aback.</p>

  <p>Other than the powerful aura surrounding her, she looked like an ordinary human. She didn't even have the snake tail, a characteristic of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at his sister dubiously, wondering if this woman in purple was truly the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Brother, this is the Snake Goddess," Yan introduced pointedly.</p>

  <p>Thankful that his sister took his hint, Luo Zheng clasped his hands and bowed towards the woman. "Snake Goddess, greetings!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded slightly, watching Luo Zheng carefully. "I never expected the two Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds would be this successful," she said, her voice sounding as smooth as butter. "I am very pleased with your achievements. I believe that the Lord of Weapons shares the same sentiments."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's and Yan's bloodlines didn't come from Lorena. Instead, through the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds, the pure bloodlines had been integrated into their bodies. As a result, Yan had the bloodline of the Snake Goddess and Luo Zheng had Chiyou's.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, thank you. I am flattered," Luo Zheng replied calmly.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess continued. "Back then, the Lord of Weapons didn't listen to my advice and insisted on guarding the Pearl Islet with his clansmen. In the end, things didn't turn out well for him. It only proved he made the wrong decision." Her eyes narrowed. "If he had been willing to bring his subordinates to Pear Province, he and the other members of Nine Li race would have survived."</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain had a close relationship with the human race, especially with the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Back when the Bearing race had started the war, if the Nine Li race had chosen to retreat, they never would've ended up like that.</p>

  <p>Yet, Chiyou and his nine brothers were extremely unyielding.</p>

  <p>Since the Bearing race had dared cross the Nine Li race, they were determined to punish them, and they had the ability to do so. However, after the Divine Farmer race joined the Bearing race, the Nine Li race couldn't stand a chance of winning anymore.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had heard about these past events before through several channels. By now, he had already known the whole story. Maintaining his calm expression, he nodded slightly. He wasn't here to chitchat; Luo Zheng wanted to know why the Snake Goddess summoned him.</p>

  <p>As the Snake Goddess spoke, her eyes looked Luo Zheng up and down. Suddenly, her beautiful eyes showed a trace of confusion. Reaching out her hand, she said, "Come over here."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't understand what was going on, but reluctantly obeyed.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess gently touched Luo Zheng's arm. With a light tap of her fingers, a vast amount of force had been injected into Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>The force reached 1500 Jun. If it weren't for the support of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Luo Zheng's arm would have been damaged from the sudden power.</p>

  <p>However, as the Other Shore Power spread from his arm, all the spots of light within Luo Zheng's body suddenly pulsated excitedly, as though they were preparing to fight this new "infection". Simultaneously, wisps of golden light shot forth from Luo Zheng's body, aiming directly at the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Hum?" The Snake Goddess was puzzled. The power of the golden light was very weak. With a flick of her hand, some wisps of golden light dissipated instantly and more of them dived into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"You just integrated the Chaotic Source Spirits into your body yesterday.</p>

  <p>How are they stronger than Yan's?" Her brows knitted. "And what is the golden light just now? Its aura is similar to the Truth of Powerful Holy Body, but not exactly the same..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was very perceptive. If it were anyone else, they probably would not have been able to tell the difference between them.</p>

  <p>As for that strange truth aura that shot out from his body, this wasn't the first time it had appeared. Luo Zheng had only chosen to ignore it because it was so weak in combat.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Luo Zheng hesitated. It wasn't because he was distrustful of the Snake Goddess, but rather he didn't want to discuss things he didn't fully understand yet. "I don't know where the golden light comes from. As long as power is injected into my body, or I'm hit in battle, it will pop out..."</p>

  <p>Frowning slightly, the Snake Goddess seemed to be lost in thought.</p>

  <p>Just like Fuxi's strength, the Snake Goddess's wisdom was universally known.</p>

  <p>However, despite her intelligence, it was difficult for her to figure out the Truth of Divine Dao on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"There are countless strange and confusing things about the chaos, but most of them are related to the Other Shore. The Truth of Divine Dao is used for one to enter the Other Shore," she said carefully. "Yet, this kind of Truth of Divine Dao you showed has nothing to do with the Other Shore. This is not the Truth of Divine Dao from the chaos!" Her eyes shone bright with wisdom. "I heard from Fuxi that you have used another kind of Truth of Divine Dao in the Chaotic Source World. It seemed that it was not included in the thirteen Truths of Divine Dao. It confused me." She paused, as though deep in thought.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, could you show me that Truth of Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Truth of Three-Energy Construction had been used in public before.</p>

  <p>The others might not notice, but Fuxi noticed it immediately.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Snake Goddess wanted Luo Zheng to help her understand the situation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood motionless for a moment. After a while, he said, "Snake Goddess, since you asked, I will accept your request. However, I want to ask you a question before I do so."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead." The Snake Goddess nodded.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, have you met any humans on the Other Shore?" Luo Zheng asked abruptly.</p>
