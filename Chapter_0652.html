<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>An incredible expression also appeared on the face of the old man who had brought Luo Zheng here.</p>

  <p>His duty was to identify those talented people from the Lower World, who were good at learning the Law Power.</p>

  <p>After all, it was almost impossible for the disciples from the Lower World to have such a high level of Law Power, the contents of which were recorded on these obelisks. For example, level-one Fire Law was recorded on the obelisk of Fire Law and level-one Space Law was written on the obelisk where Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>'This guy has finished a third of the journey in such a short time, which indicates that he has grasped a small part of level one of Space Law.</p>

  <p>How can he climb so fast?' The old man thought, surprised.</p>

  <p>It was a rare opportunity to acquire the knowledge on the obelisk. So some martial arts cultivators had stayed here for a long time. The men from Dragon Lineage Human had been here for half a year, a year, or even longer.</p>

  <p>It was relatively easier to learn Law Power directly from the obelisk.</p>

  <p>However, the old man had never seen a man climb so quickly on the obelisk of Space Law.</p>

  <p>'The only possible explanation is that the boy has studied Space Law before and has some achievements, which allow him to climb so fast.</p>

  <p>Once he stops, he may not be able to climb up any further.' The old man rationalized as he tried to think of a convincing reason.</p>

  <p>It seemed that this was the only explanation for Zheng's speed.</p>

  <p>What the old man wasn't aware of was that Luo Zheng had merely learned a small part of Space Law by chance.</p>

  <p>The space repulsion grew more intense when Luo Zheng climbed about a hundred feet. At this stage, he felt a sharp pain.</p>

  <p>'The space repulsion is getting stronger and stronger. I need to stop now!'</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng stopped climbing and continued to learn the Law Power on the obelisk. By this time, he was ahead of most cultivators on the obelisks. Only a few people were ahead of him now.</p>

  <p>The old man kept staring at Luo Zheng as he wanted to prove his suspicion to be right.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a middle-aged man accompanied by several young martial artists approached the old man.</p>

  <p>That man said to the old man with a strange expression, "Elder Wei, how many elite disciples did you select this time?"</p>

  <p>Elder Wei answered coldly with a frown, "None. Have you selected suitable candidates?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged person beckoned to several young people behind him and laughed, "These four men of our Dragon Lineage Human will definitely be elected as the elites! Haha!"</p>

  <p>There were two men and two women standing alongside the middle-aged man. They had reached a high level of cultivation base. Hearing what the middle-aged man said, they suddenly became quite confident.</p>

  <p>These four people were undoubtedly the most outstanding people from Dragon Lineage Human. They not only had a high cultivation base and basic skills, but they also had an impeccable pedigree.</p>

  <p>Then Elder Wei looked up and down the four young disciples and said with a feigned smile, "Zack! Congratulations! I wish all of them are selected as elites!"</p>

  <p>The old man gnashed his teeth as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Elder Wei was one of the guides of Dragon Lineage Human. It was normal for guides to compete with each other. The fact that Zack selected several young cultivators with a great gift and then showed them to Elder Wei made him very angry.</p>

  <p>However, these young martial artists didn't know what Elder Wei meant.</p>

  <p>One of them even bowed to him and said with a laugh, "Elder Wei! With your blessing, we will certainly make it!"</p>

  <p>"Humph," Elder Wei's face was clouded. He didn't want to speak to these young disciples anymore. He began to look at Luo Zheng again and wondered what was wrong with him.</p>

  <p>He shrieked when he caught sight of Luo Zheng again. 'How did this boy continue to climb further?' Elder Wei was too surprised to speak.</p>

  <p>Before the conversation with Zack, Luo Zheng had been stopped by the strong spatial repulsion. It appeared as though he couldn't climb anymore. Who would have expected that Luo Zheng would rise at an alarming speed?</p>

  <p>Twenty feet......</p>

  <p>Fifty feet......</p>

  <p>One hundred feet......</p>

  <p>Before long, Luo Zheng had reached the second half of the obelisk of Space Law.</p>

  <p>"Wow! He learns the law so fast!" Elder Wei muttered with an amazed expression.</p>

  <p>Although the Law Power recorded on the obelisk was merely at level one, it was extremely difficult to learn. And Space Law was even harder to grasp.</p>

  <p>If this guy were climbing on merit, he would certainly be qualified to be an elite!</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes! This young man belongs to my team!"</p>

  <p>Elder Wei mumbled, patting himself on the back. He had almost forgotten that Luo Zheng was a cultivator on his team. He had ignored Luo Zheng mainly because this boy didn't have the blood of Genuine Dragon in his veins. In fact, Luo Zheng earned a place in this competition because of the city lord.</p>

  <p>Seeing Elder Wei's surprised expression, Zack looked at the stone tablet that was not far from them. A sardonic expression replaced his smile when Zack realized that Luo Zheng had finished more than half of the journey on the obelisk of Space Law. Then he said to the several martial artists behind him, "Now, it's time for you to learn the Law Power on the obelisks! I have told you what I know! Now, you have to climb up the stone tablets to understand the rest."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Elder Zhao!" One of the cultivators spoke, "I'll also choose to learn Space Law!"</p>

  <p>Zack waved at him and said with a laugh, "Christopher, compete with that boy! You can climb further in the blink of an eye! I believe in your talent!"</p>

  <p>Christopher Shu nodded in agreement and sat in meditation beside the obelisk. As soon as his soul was attached to the stone tablet, Christopher began to climb. Within minutes, he had overtaken most of the cultivators.</p>

  <p>"Haha, Christopher has learned a big part of the level one of Space Law.</p>

  <p>It is so easy for him to learn the Law Power," Zack said happily.</p>

  <p>Elder Wei's face darkened when he saw that Christopher was about to climb ahead of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Christopher Shu climbed so fast. It appeared as though the spatial repulsion didn't exist at all.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was still concentrating on studying the Law Power on the obelisk. He didn't notice Christopher approaching him.</p>

  <p>Christopher gave Luo Zheng a challenging look when he reached Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shot him a surprised backward glance before continuing to study the Space Law on the stone tablet. It had never occurred to him that he was a valuable chip in the competition between two elders.</p>

  <p>Christopher continued to climb. He didn't stop until he consolidated his lead in this competition. Then he said to Luo Zheng, "Haha, boy, you are as slow as a tortoise!"</p>

  <p>'Where is this idiot from?' Luo Zheng thought with a frown. However, he chose to pay no attention to Christopher's taunt and kept on studying the Law Power.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Christopher climbed down unexpectedly and spoke again, "I am talking to you. Do you hear me?"</p>

  <p>As an influential figure in the Lower World, Christopher grew up with the feeling that he ought to be respected. He was outraged when Luo Zheng ignored him.</p>

  <p>"Could you please not climb up and down like a monkey?" Driven beyond endurance, Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>"Climbing up and down also needs skills! Boy, come on, go ahead of me!" Christopher sneered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't talk any more. On the contrary, he shifted his focus to the knowledge on the obelisk. He was unwilling to take notice of this kind of boring provocation. Moreover, he had climbed the obelisk to learn Space Law, not to compete with others.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng didn't want to talk to him, Christopher got bored and then climbed up again.</p>

  <p>However, Christopher stopped climbing after about twenty feet as he needed to learn the new knowledge on the obelisk. Otherwise, he would fall from the stone tablet as a result of the strong spatial repulsion.</p>

  <p>Of course, Christopher was confident of his capability and was sure that he could grasp level one of Space Law in a short time.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Luo Zheng also began to climb, his eyes glistening.</p>
