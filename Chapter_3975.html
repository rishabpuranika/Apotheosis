<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sawyer and Thurston had not been born on the Other Shore— rather, they came from the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Knotting race was the ruling civilization of the 733rd chaos. Sawyer and Thurston were the most capable assistants of the strongest warrior in the Knotting race.</p>

  <p>As King Ieuan had said, the Knotting race was known for the courage of its members.</p>

  <p>In the quest to achieve the Finale Way, many members of the Knotting race had been killed as blood sacrifices. But it was all in vain. The strongest warrior had still failed, and could only lead the remaining members to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, even on the Other Shore, the Knotting race still advocated the Finale Way. This put them at odds with the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the strongest warrior of the Knotting race was killed by the Eye Spirit, along with almost all the other members of the race. Only Sawyer and his brother Thurston had survived.</p>

  <p>Like all the members of the Knotting race, the two brothers used to have a deep obsession with the Finale Way. But after they became Eternal Realm Hunters, they gradually began to give up on achieving it. Now, after long years of staying in the Three Purities Stage, they never mentioned the Finale Way anymore.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan suddenly said something that immediately caught their attention. It told them that they could realize the Finale Way. Sawyer looked at first shocked, then he smirked as though he'd heard a funny joke.</p>

  <p>"So, you are the creatures in the current chaos?" Thurston asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>"This round of chaos is about to come to an end soon. I wonder whether you have been fully prepared, and how strong the strongest of you truly is," said Sawyer in a mocking tone.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan pondered this for a few moments. Then it shook its head. "I don't know."</p>

  <p>Sawyer let out a sharp bark of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Since going to the Supreme Pure Realm, we have paid little attention to what is happening in the chaos, but we know clearly that there is no ruling force in this round," he said. "What makes you think you can realize the Finale Way?"</p>

  <p>There were many preparations needed in order to complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>A ruling civilization established its dominion and ensured that no other force in the chaos could resist it. This allowed the members of that civilization to focus on preparing for the completion of the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>Now, however, the various super forces in the chaos were fighting each other. How could anyone have the time to prepare for the Finale Way?</p>

  <p>Sawyer's question left King Ieuan speechless.</p>

  <p>It quickly realized that Sawyer was right.</p>

  <p>So far, almost no preparations had been made for the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>How could they complete it?</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess listened calmly from where she stood on the vine.</p>

  <p>Something flickered in her eyes as she said, "Although our human race is not a ruling force, we have killed Claire from the Element Spirit Civilization and the Grandmaster of Heaven from the Nihility race."</p>

  <p>Her words surprised Sawyer, Thurston, and Pearson greatly.</p>

  <p>Both Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven were top masters on the Other Shore. Had the members of the human race truly defeated them? What great abilities did they possess to accomplish such feats?</p>

  <p>Sawyer sneered. In a tone of skepticism, he said, "Do you have any proof?</p>

  <p>Are we supposed to simply believe your claims?"</p>

  <p>It was hard to fathom the truth of what the Snake Goddess said, since they had not seen Claire or the Grandmaster of Heaven defeated with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why else do you think is the Element Spirit Civilization so determined to kill us? Even at the cost of the Bone Fragments Secret Soul?" the Snake Goddess asked coolly.</p>

  <p>Sawyer hesitated, exchanging glances with Thurston. The brothers realized that what the Snake Goddess said made sense.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the three Eternal Realm Hunters, this task was extremely simple.</p>

  <p>Zheng was obviously the most powerful in his group.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had used the ice piece to pass its orders and tasks to other creatures. Somehow, the Eternal Realm Hunters had managed to get their hands on an ice piece, through which they received the current task. They then conducted an investigation and learned that Zheng had massive physical strength, and that he had killed Hawley in the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>Thus, based on what the Eternal Realm Hunters knew about the Flaming Maple Forest, Zheng had a stronger body than Hawley.</p>

  <p>However, the Eternal Realm Hunters weren't afraid of a powerful body or physical strength alone. Without the suppression of the Flaming Maple Forest, they thought it would not be difficult for them to kill Zheng using their theurgies.</p>

  <p>The task proved as simple as they had anticipated. Zheng had no time to fight back before he fell into the Black Sun of Sawyer and Thurston.</p>

  <p>But why did the Element Spirit Civilization have to chase after this human team?</p>

  <p>They had offered the Bone Fragments Secret Soul as a reward. They had mobilized almost all the creatures in the Grand Pure Realm. Clearly, the Element Spirit Civilization was determined to kill these humans.</p>

  <p>"You want us to let you go, right? It's impossible! We'll kill you!"</p>

  <p>With an audible hiss, the spider threads spread out over the humans.</p>

  <p>The threads enveloped Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi saw that battle was unavoidable, and his eyes began to flash with a deep golden light. The brilliance of his golden sword was blinding.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yasamin flipped her hand, and a bone sword appeared in her grip. It looked ordinary, but as she brandished it, the sword emanated a mysterious and powerful aura.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan also activated their bloodlines.</p>

  <p>They all understood that they were fighting for their lives, so they would enter this battle at full strength.</p>

  <p>The air soon filled with powerful auras.</p>

  <p>Green shoots suddenly sprouted from the ground as the Heavenly Eye Vine joined the battle. The shoots rapidly grew into countless thick, thorny vines, transforming the flat ground into a dense, prickly forest.</p>

  <p>As the battle was about to start, Sawyer and Thurston felt an unexpected vibration in their chests. Suddenly, two black semicircles appeared out of nowhere, marking their bodies.</p>

  <p>The two brothers stared down at the black semicircles on their chests, wearing identical expressions of shock and confusion.</p>

  <p>Pearson had already begun to launch an attack, but he stopped abruptly, gazing warily at the strange black marks.</p>

  <p>The Black Sun was a bloodline theurgy unique to Sawyer and Thurston.</p>

  <p>Only when the two brothers faced each other could the complete Black Sun be summoned.</p>

  <p>The Black Sun was an incomprehensible world. If any god was trapped inside, they would be killed— there was no possibility of survival.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the most significant feature of the Black Sun was the impossibility of escaping from it. Once Sawyer and Thurston separated, there would be no exit.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong one was and what special abilities they had, they could never pass through an exit that did not exist.</p>

  <p>For instance, once in the Supreme Pure Realm, the three Eternal Realm Hunters had encountered the immortal Cyan Bone Ghosts, and used the Black Sun on them.</p>

  <p>It was said that the ninety-nine Cyan Bone Ghosts in the Supreme Pure Realm never died. They had wandered aimlessly for a long time in the Supreme Pure Realm, killing countless creatures who crossed their paths.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race had been unable to deal with them, and instead evaded the Cyan Bone Ghosts when they encountered them.</p>

  <p>But when Sawyer and Thurston had encountered them, two Cyan Bone Ghosts had been devoured by the Black Sun. They were never seen again after that— for all intents and purposes, they were dead, killed by the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>Since even the Cyan Bone Ghosts couldn't escape the Black Sun, how could Zheng ever manage it?</p>

  <p>After Sawyer and Thurston sucked Zheng into the Black Sun, they were absolutely certain that he was not only gone, but dead.</p>

  <p>They had never imagined that someone could survive after being devoured by the Black Sun. It was too strange to even consider.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?" Pearson asked quickly, looking with concern at the brothers.</p>

  <p>"I— I don't know. I have never seen half of the Black Sun before— "</p>

  <p>As Sawyer spoke, he was interrupted by movement within the black semicircle on his chest. He staggered backwards. Something was crawling out from within the dark depths.</p>

  <p>It was half a body. Everyone stared, mouths gaping, while the other half of the body also crawled out from the semicircle in Thurston's chest.</p>

  <p>The movements of the two halves were coordinated. Obviously, they belonged to a single being, although an invisible space in the middle still separated them as they crawled out.</p>

  <p>The two halves of the Black Sun exerted an irresistible gravitational force upon each other. Independent of any action by Sawyer and Thurston, the two black semicircles drew closer and closer to each other, dragging the two brothers towards one another.</p>

  <p>Finally, the two halves met, and the Black Sun was formed. As the circle became whole, so did the two halves of the body, joining together to form a single human shape.</p>
