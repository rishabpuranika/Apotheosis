  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It's not that the life vitality is mild here. We barely detect it as there is so little," Lawson observed indifferently.</p>

  <p>Although the life vitality in the Upper World was definitely more violent, it was also more concentrated than in the Lower World. This was the Godly Geniuses' first time to descend to the Lower World, and it made them feel a bit out of their element.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they all brought enough life vitality jades with them. It wouldn't affect them much even if the life vitality here was insufficient.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nathan's expression was a little gloomy. He and Lawson only came to the Lower World because Lucille went along with Zheng. He didn't think that their presence here was necessary.</p>

  <p>They had flown over the sea for an entire day and night, and had encountered a few vicious beasts along the way.</p>

  <p>But when these vicious beasts felt the powerful auras of these people, they sank back into the sea and stayed hidden.</p>

  <p>Lawson and Nathan had nothing interesting to do during their travel.</p>

  <p>They had casually caught and killed some of the ferocious beasts they encountered, and caused a huge commotion.</p>

  <p>As the sun rose on the second day, a white line appeared on the horizon in front of Zheng. The white line steadily increased in size as they flew closer. It was a snowy mountain standing on the surface of the sea.</p>

  <p>Seeing the snow-capped mountain, Zheng couldn't help but smile. He recognized the mountain, and knew that it was located in the west of the Central Region. They had already reached their destination.</p>

  <p>After crossing the boundary of the snowy mountain, they didn't even pause for rest. They continued to travel east until they reached the first city, the Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>This city was built by the Mysterious Luna Hall. Although the power of the Mysterious Luna Hall was not as great as it had been before, there was still a spatial passageway in the city.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's group quickly descended from the sky and landed in front of the spatial passageway.</p>

  <p>The guards at the entrance to the spatial passageway did not know what to do upon seeing the warriors.</p>

  <p>They didn't know where these people came from. To their intense surprise, each of these warriors radiated a strong aura, and their cultivation levels were immeasurable.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, these people did not seem to have any intention of enmity. They even made an effort to conceal their auras. Otherwise, these guards would have fainted on the spot from sheer terror.</p>

  <p>"You... You... What are you trying to do?" the leader of the guards stammered, his courage slightly greater than his companions.</p>

  <p>"We intend to use the spatial passageway that leads to Cloudy City."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes swept over them. With a flick of his hand, two supreme life vitality crystals materialized in front of the guard and Zheng stepped into the passageway.</p>

  <p>Xenia, on the other hand, smiled kindly towards the guards. Only then did all of the warriors follow Zheng into the spatial passageway.</p>

  <p>The guards simultaneously breathed a sigh of relief after all these people had disappeared.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Cloudy City was enveloped in silence.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had left for the Upper World, the situation in the Central Region had been under control by the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance. Other powers had shown some signs of rising up, such as the Ethereal Spirit Sect, but they were left far behind.</p>

  <p>In just a short span of time, two warriors from the Cloud Hall had already ascended to the Upper World. One was Zheng; the other one was Yudie, leader of the Cloud Hall. This was a very rare occurrence through the history of the Central Region. The legends about the two of them had long been known and told among countless people.</p>

  <p>Right then, the spatial passageway between the Cloudy City and the Mysterious City suddenly fluctuated. Zheng took a step forward, and his gaze fell upon the pure white clouds in the sky. He was relieved that the Cloud Hall was still floating above the Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>Over the years, he had actually searched often through the memories of the great world.</p>

  <p>He was keenly aware of each and every matter that happened in the Central Region. When he saw the Cloud Hall at that moment, he had a strange feeling in his heart.</p>

  <p>After all, it was after he ascended to the Upper World that Yudie gave birth to their son, and he realized that he was already a father.</p>

  <p>The transmission array at the Cloudy City was expanded two years ago.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Cloudy City could be considered as the center of the Central Region. The spatial passageway extended to four major directions, connecting thirteen large cities. It could be considered as one of the most important transportation routes in the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>"You may not want to go to the Cloudy City, but if you want to go to some of the more remote cities, you'd have to use the transmission array of the Cloudy City," they would say.</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of Zheng's group immediately made them the center of unwanted attraction.</p>

  <p>The guards of the Cloud Hall immediately surrounded them. According to the city's rules, they needed to interrogate the newcomers about their intentions.</p>

  <p>Because of the Cloud Hall, these guards were used to encounters with quite a few powerful figures. However, Zheng's group undeniably exuded a powerful presence the moment they stepped out of the transmission array.</p>

  <p>This type of aura was generated when many mighty warriors were mingling together in one place.</p>

  <p>Take Tianming, for example. He gave off a refreshing feeling that was very comfortable, but one that couldn't be ignored.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, gave off a feeling of sharpness, as if he was a sword that was always kept inside its sheath. Although it was sheathed, one could not deny that it was very sharp.</p>

  <p>Lucille was like a cold plum, cold but not difficult to approach.</p>

  <p>The leader of the guards braced himself and rallied his subordinates over.</p>

  <p>The leader thought to himself, 'The Central Region has only been at peace for the last seven to eight years. Today, a group of people that shouldn't be provoked appeared. We need to be ready for anything that might happen.'</p>

  <p>For regular people like them, they knew that if they upset these warriors, they would probably be annihilated instantly.</p>

  <p>The leader of the guards had been guarding the transmission array for more than a decade already.</p>

  <p>He had met Zheng on several occasions in the past, and every time he saw Zheng, his level of cultivation would be much higher that the last time.</p>

  <p>As he came nearer, he immediately recognized Zheng. This time, Zheng's level of cultivation was so strong that he could no longer gauge it.</p>

  <p>Having learned from the mistakes of the past few years, the leader did his best to hold back his emotions. "Is it Master Luo who has returned?" he asked in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>He was uncertain of how to address Zheng. It was a conditioned reflex of his to add the word "Master" to his surname, and he knew he could never go wrong.</p>

  <p>"Master Luo?"</p>

  <p>"What Master Luo?"</p>

  <p>"Who is this person?"</p>

  <p>The other guards were puzzled, not realizing who their leader was referring to.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been gone for around seven years. In the eyes of the people in the Central Region, he was already a legendary figure. It was hard for them to believe that he had returned.</p>

  <p>Right then, several other figures emerged from another spatial passageway.</p>

  <p>They were members of the Zhuo Clan in Cloudy City, and the one leading the group was none other than Frank.</p>

  <p>After many years of hard work, he had finally overcome the bottleneck and stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors had the capability to hold the position of elders in the past Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, the current Cloud Hall was already considered as a sacred place, so naturally, the requirements for each position would increase at the same time. After the number of Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists increased in number, Frank did not qualify for the elder position anymore.</p>

  <p>This time, he had just returned from completing a mission at the Ethereal Spirit Sect. The moment he stepped out of the spatial passageway, he felt a terrifying aura.</p>

  <p>After he saw the appearance of the person in the lead, Frank's expression drastically changed. It was his father's killer— Zheng.</p>
