<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1707 Soaring Snake </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Kurt had always remained calm. His actions were unhurried but were carried out with care and confidence.</p>

  <p>He was never that harsh when facing a weaker opponent.</p>

  <p>However, the same couldn't be said when he met stronger foes that were close to his level. Everyone witnessed how confident and calculated his moves were when he faced Lawson.</p>

  <p>Despite his precision in fighting, however, the audience still found his performance lackluster.</p>

  <p>An image flashed before Kurt's eyes before he finally took action.</p>

  <p>He was someone who cultivated the Future Constellation Kalpa. This cultivation method gifted him with the Blessed Buddha Land's skill that enabled him to see into the future: the Constellation Eyes.</p>

  <p>As he poured life vitality into his eyes, he would be able to see into a specific moment in the future that was reflected in his pupils.</p>

  <p>There were only two warriors who mastered this token. One was Kurt himself, and the other was the Buddhist abbot of the Hidden Spirit Temple.</p>

  <p>Kurt had the ability to see nine seconds into the future.</p>

  <p>Half a minute more would be too blurry, while a full minute would simply yield him nothing.</p>

  <p>The scene he saw half a minute later painted a horrible picture!</p>

  <p>Tianming activated his extremely sharp token and killed him!</p>

  <p>The blur prevented Kurt from making out the exact token Tianming used so he wouldn't be able to shield himself against it.</p>

  <p>He could only take the initiative and launch the attack.</p>

  <p>"Scorching Sun token!"</p>

  <p>Kurt yelled. He stretched out his palms from which he launched a giant Buddhist wheel.</p>

  <p>The Buddhist wheel shone brightly, like a blinding, dazzling sun.</p>

  <p>There was actually no such thing as a Godly Genius in the cultivation of Buddhism.</p>

  <p>Buddhist cultivation was divided into four levels of meditation.</p>

  <p>It was only after the final, fourth level would one be finally able to practice the token.</p>

  <p>Only when a warrior was able to use a token could he really live and breathe Buddhism. In a sense, he was a Godly Genius of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Since Kurt had already gone beyond the fourth level and mastered the token, he could then be considered as a Godly Genius of the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>The token came in the form of thousands of golden palm prints that crashed down over Tianming.</p>

  <p>Buddhism was grand.</p>

  <p>It was not an exaggeration to say that this token had the power to possibly ruin the world.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng, Nathan, and the other Godly Geniuses were shocked at this display of sheer power.</p>

  <p>"This little monk... How could he be so powerful?"</p>

  <p>"Scorching Sun token! He cultivated the most powerful token of the Hidden Spirit Temple!"</p>

  <p>"Warriors from the Blessed Buddha Land have always been uninterested in fighting but they have a profound heritage."</p>

  <p>"That Tianming will be defeated by the grand Buddhist heritage."</p>

  <p>The scene in front of them truly widened their horizons.</p>

  <p>It was a mere battle between two Soul Sea Realm warriors but this sudden climax was extremely overwhelming.</p>

  <p>A few Spirit Supreme Realm and Spirit Transformation Realm warriors even shivered. Not many of them were confident that they'd be able to withstand such a strong attack.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the golden palms crashed down wasn't fast but they were as dense as the entire heavens crashing down on one's body.</p>

  <p>"This token is really strong," Tianming muttered worriedly. As the golden sky crashed down, he raised his long sword above his head.</p>

  <p>A silver light emanated from the sword but it grew dimmer by the second.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that the others looked at the sword properly.</p>

  <p>It was normal, around 1.1 meters long.</p>

  <p>The blade was two fingers wide with a wooden hilt and a ridge in the middle.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about this sword. It looked extremely ordinary.</p>

  <p>However, beyond its simplistic design were two words carved onto the blade: 'Soaring Snake.'</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake.</p>

  <p>This sword belonged to the Lord of Weapons.</p>

  <p>It was Chiyou's* sword. (Chiyou is Chinese Weaponry God. According to legend he invented many deadly weapons.)</p>

  <p>All the most powerful weapons, whether it might be a knife, spear, sword or halberd, were made by the Lord of Weapons.</p>

  <p>The most powerful knife ever made was named the Tiger Soul.</p>

  <p>Then there was also the sword named Soaring Snake.</p>

  <p>There was a spear called the Fierce Killing.</p>

  <p>Then a halberd by the name of the Devil Killing.</p>

  <p>A set of armor named as the Luminous Light.</p>

  <p>A crossbow called the Sky Piercing.</p>

  <p>And lastly, a dagger-axe known as the Destructive War.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake was considered as the strongest weapon among the supreme primordial weapons. It was also formerly a missing heritage of the Lord of Weapons, Chiyou.</p>

  <p>"The Soaring Snake evolved into a dragon and the polestar twinkled. A noble man should act like a dragon and walk the way to justice!" Tianming chanted.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Sword he comprehended back then contained the Justice Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Cultivating the Heavenly Sword Illustration was the only way to find Chiyou's treasure.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Sword Illustration that was discovered and spread all over the world was the key to such a powerful weapon. However, Tianming was the only one who succeeded in cultivating it after so many years.</p>

  <p>He was called by the treasure into the savage land where he found it.</p>

  <p>Tianming's Lotus Flower was the same as Luo Zheng's at that time, blooming continually to the last petal.</p>

  <p>He already knew his destiny.</p>

  <p>The universe was just an interlude.</p>

  <p>And this Illusion Battlefield was his ladder.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A streak of light flashed underneath Tianming and shot up high in the sky like a pillar.</p>

  <p>This light pierced through the clouds, the star group, and even the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>The pillar was seen by so many warriors in the universe as it rose up straight out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>"Alas... Darn it." The mysterious girl stared at the light pillar that suddenly showed up beside her. "He actually found Chiyou's sword.</p>

  <p>What change will happen in this round of grand era? It's really hard to figure out."</p>

  <p>The thought depressed her, suddenly finding her job difficult to handle.</p>

  <p>"What... an odd scene!"</p>

  <p>"I've seen thirty-three apocalyptic astronomical phenomena and endless auspicious clouds, but this is the first time I ever saw a light pillar like this," a Supreme Lord remarked.</p>

  <p>"What did he do?!"</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful light pillar!"</p>

  <p>Karl stood on top of the stone and was also shocked at the appearance of Tianming's golden pillar.</p>

  <p>"A noble man... A noble man should act like a dragon!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Karl had been cultivating the Justice Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>His Lotus Flower had completely bloomed, however, his comprehension of 'justice' had gotten more and more radical. He also got lost for a time.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Justice Divine Dao Tianming activated was like seeing a light break through the darkness. He did not realize how off-path he had been until he saw the light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Tianming stepped forward and bathed himself in the light.</p>

  <p>He held the Soaring Snake in front of his chest and faced those golden palm prints.</p>

  <p>As he held his sword up, the sword suddenly emitted a dazzling sword light. This was the ultimate justice of the swordsmanship!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The light emanated from the blade in waves.</p>

  <p>Reflected in these waves were the golden palm prints.</p>

  <p>As the two made contact, the waves shattered, like bright, dazzling glass.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the waves though. The palm prints also shattered at the same time!</p>

  <p>The waves were weaved from Tianming's sword light.</p>

  <p>Nobody had seen it coming.</p>

  <p>Nobody realized that this Soaring Snake was actually everywhere.</p>

  <p>Kurt's confidence broke and his brows furrowed at the events that had just transpired.</p>

  <p>His shoulders slumped the moment he decided to yield to his opponent.</p>

  <p>Because he already saw what would happen nine seconds later.</p>

  <p>What would happen half a minute later was blurry because it was still uncertain, so Kurt would fight tooth and nail to change the fate.</p>

  <p>However, what would happen nine seconds later was so clear, indicating its certainty. He could not do anything to change that.</p>

  <p>The scene flashed before his eyes: it was him, covered by the waves similar to the ones produced by Tianming.</p>

  <p>That was the moment Kurt knew that he was to die by Tianming's sword.</p>

  <p>There was no need to resist.</p>

  <p>Three seconds passed.</p>

  <p>And then six.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, the nine seconds were up.</p>

  <p>Everything was just like what his Constellation Eyes showed him.</p>

  <p>The invisible sword intent skimmed through his body.</p>

  <p>Tianming overpowered Kurt and eventually broke his Scorching Sun token.</p>

  <p>The waves of light shattered and disappeared, along with Kurt's body.</p>

  <p>The results were evidently clear: Tianming won!</p>

  <p>The Heaven Earth Board quietly reconstructed itself, mending each line and point with white and black stones.</p>

  <p>Tianming sheathed his Soaring Snake back into its scabbard.</p>

  <p>There was a slight clink as his blade was put away while the entire universe was plunged into silence.</p>

  <p>The performances of these Godly Geniuses were truly amazing.</p>

  <p>There were ten of them and each had the potential to become the universe's top warriors in the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>Kurt, Lawson, Karl, all of them.</p>

  <p>This was a generation of amazingly powerful talents.</p>

  <p>But what Tianming displayed just now was way beyond everyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>"The new great world! This is truly the beginning of the new great world of chaos! Ha-ha!" someone shouted in glee and broke the silence.</p>

  <p>The warriors, who had initially been stunned by the battle's outcome, finally came to their senses.</p>

  <p>"Is he... really from... your Cloud Hall?" Preston asked, not really believing what he witnessed just now.</p>

  <p>He was a Spirit Transformation Realm master, two realms higher than Tianming. But he knew that he would even lose to this young man if he fought with him.</p>

  <p>How in the world could he do that though?</p>

  <p>He was two realms below!</p>

  <p>"Right!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded with a smile. The pride was evident on her face.</p>
