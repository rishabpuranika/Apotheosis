  <p>
</p>

  <p>At this point, the only option to exit was this creaky, wooden bridge.</p>

  <p>However, the python remained at the intersection of forks. There was nothing they could do.</p>

  <p>Silence took over the disciples as they heard what Chaim just said.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Sally whispered hastily.</p>

  <p>"What else can we do? Honestly, I guess it's all just up to fate right now," one of the Nine Li members said, shaking his head anxiously.</p>

  <p>To make matters worse, the python was unpredictable. Even if it did disappear, they did not dare to go onto the wooden bridge. Who knew when the python would return? The way back to the temple was so long, and the chances of returning safely were too small.</p>

  <p>Standing beside Zheng, Dorothy was not as depressed as the others. As long as Zheng stood by her, she was unafraid. There was no reason to fear.</p>

  <p>"What if I draw it away?" Zheng asked the bunch.</p>

  <p>Dorothy thought about it quickly and then shook her head in disagreement.</p>

  <p>"You're no match for this python. Moreover, even if you can lure it away, how far can you go? You couldn't go into the dark, right? Then after it finishes you, it will come back for us. We would die as well."</p>

  <p>"I can lead it into the Dark Region," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"I know." Dorothy nodded, thinking of the candles in her space ring. She already had a rough idea what was the use of these candles. "But your speed can't compare with the python's, and there are so much more threats in the Dark Region. The result will be the same."</p>

  <p>Of course, she didn't want Zheng to sacrifice for nothing.</p>

  <p>Facing the python, everyone began brainstorming. Some people even tried to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune, but it was just wishful thinking to want to leave here by such an easy way.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Just then, the red python began to wriggle. When it opened its mouth, its long tongue made a strange sound.</p>

  <p>"You fool! Go back!"</p>

  <p>……</p>

  <p>……</p>

  <p>In desperation, these disciples even tried to use words to drive the python away.</p>

  <p>Of course, that idea flopped, and the beast remained motionless on the ground, yet threatening.</p>

  <p>The rules and competition in the Dark Region were also cruel, so the residing creatures also had to rack their brains to capture more prey.</p>

  <p>However, the python had no choice but to wait there, as Zheng and his group chose to stay on the spot.</p>

  <p>Time went by and there was no progress.</p>

  <p>Hutton walked back and forth to think. Meanwhile, Chaim searched for some clues inside and outside the hut, but in the end, he found nothing. He could only move within the range of light, which was too limited for him to even go around.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Zheng felt a violent vibration under his feet.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>The vibration spread out like a wave, resounding in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Neither Zheng nor the Souls of Light could feel the energy fluctuating in the dark, so once they felt the vibration, they knew it must have been going on for a while.</p>

  <p>Even the red python resting on the ground raised its head in curiosity. Its eyes were filled with vigilance.</p>

  <p>Just then, it instinctively hid. After crawling for a while on the ground, it went towards the darkness under the wooden bridge.</p>

  <p>"What on earth caused the vibration? Look, even the python seems a little rattled!"</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that there is an even stronger being approaching?"</p>

  <p>"There can't be anything more terrifying than the python. This can't be!"</p>

  <p>Just as they discussed, a loud bang came again, and this time, it was followed by a more outrageous, violent vibration.</p>

  <p>In the same moment, it was as if a huge monster waved across the bridge.</p>

  <p>When it passed through, the crowd vaguely recognized a shadow: a fluffy giant hand.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm doomed..."</p>

  <p>The python was already so frightening to them. At the looks of it and considering the vibration, this creature was probably a thousand times larger than the red python. Everyone's hearts were slowly sinking.</p>

  <p>When the huge red hand flew to the bottom of the wooden bridge, it completely disappeared in the darkness.</p>

  <p>About six seconds later, Zheng and the others felt the soles of their feet begin to quake. Afterwards, they saw the giant hand emerging from the darkness.</p>

  <p>It reached out and grabbed something like a bug.</p>

  <p>No, it was the red python!</p>

  <p>Compared with the enormous hand, it looked just like a tiny little centipede.</p>

  <p>The giant hand brought the python into the darkness, as two blue lights flashed. With that, everyone saw a huge face. It was a huge ape face.</p>

  <p>"It's the Blue Twin Stars in the Dark Region!"</p>

  <p>"So, the Blue Twin Stars are... They are... seem to be... The eyes of a giant ape?"</p>

  <p>"Such a terrible beast has been at the Stage Thirteen all this time!?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was aware that the Dark Region was some sort of massive, dark energy that remained out of reach. Once being swallowed by it, there would be no possibility of returning.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, some strange lights would flash in the Dark Region once in a while.</p>

  <p>And when the candles of the three huts were lit up, countless creatures in the Source World were immediately drawn to the light.</p>

  <p>While, the most famous part of the Dark Region was always the majestic Blue Twin Stars.</p>

  <p>The Blue Twin Stars appeared in various places. Sometimes, they would approach the entrance to the Stage Thirteen. Other times, they would be at the middle or at the end. But it was known that the Blue Twin Stars would only appear in the southern Dark Region; never the northern one.</p>

  <p>Every time the Blue Twin Stars appeared, there would be a violent shock, which was known as the Other Shore Earthquake.</p>

  <p>Because of that, almost every race took the Blue Twin Stars as the sign of an earthquake. The sign worked every time, making the wise warriors in those powerful races feel confused.</p>

  <p>Now the answer was unveiled.</p>

  <p>In this distance, they could finally see what was behind the Blue Twin Stars very clearly.</p>

  <p>Those were not stars. They were the eyes of a huge ape!</p>

  <p>The ape's body was too huge, which was why there was a dramatic quake every time it moved.</p>

  <p>This mystery had lasted for thousands of year.</p>

  <p>Zheng believed he still had a little chance to resist the red python. However, he knew that he was no match for the huge ape.</p>

  <p>The once arrogant python was sent into the ape's mouth and chewed.</p>

  <p>Because of the darkness between them, they could hardly hear the chewing sound. However, the picture the python was chewed into pieces frightened them to the core.</p>

  <p>Some of them began to regret.</p>

  <p>If they had known this was going to happen, they wouldn't have joined the exploration in the first place. This was no place for ordinary beings.</p>
