<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The air above the Heavenly Han House glittered with the White Jade Tokens everyone had thrown up to the sky, all of them arranged in order.</p>

  <p>After that, the old man with the surname of Chen walked out as a roll of yellow paper materialized in his hands.</p>

  <p>He opened the yellow paper and pointed it up towards the sky above Heavenly Han House. Then, he narrowed his lips and blew lightly.</p>

  <p>The White Jade Tokens above the Heavenly Han House glowed a bright cyan. Each time a White Jade Token flickered, a name appeared on the yellow paper together with the place the person was from.</p>

  <p>The first White Jade Token that glowed belonged to Zane, and his name appeared on the yellow paper. On the other hand, the rest of the others' names appeared one by one in order according to their tokens' height.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the roll of yellow paper had finished recording the 100, 000 proving godly warriors' names and the places they came from.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, his name would not appear on the yellow paper because he didn't throw a White Jade Token but a short halberd.</p>

  <p>But of course, the old man surnamed Chen obviously wouldn't neglect Luo Zheng. He took out an ink brush and lightly shook it, and then a small stream of ink flowed out from the brush tip. A few words were formed on the yellow paper, namely, "Tianxing Luo, Misty Mountain Village, Vast Sky Region."</p>

  <p>Zheng's name naturally ranked first, so it appeared before Zane's name.</p>

  <p>Although it made Zane internally unhappy, he had to accept the fact that Luo Zheng had easily thrown the black halberd to a height of 990 feet!</p>

  <p>Just like Seth had said, the descendants of the Han Clan sub-branches were already born with a huge advantage. It didn't matter when it came to their bloodline or talent since they were all far stronger than ordinary warriors. Once they stepped into the Godly Way and became True Gods, they would be far more powerful than ordinary True Gods.</p>

  <p>However, the Han Clan also needed to strengthen their position because a closed wealthy clan would be eliminated anytime soon.</p>

  <p>In the past, some of the rich clans on the Floating Islands were completely isolated from the outside world. The clans' disciples were prohibited from marrying outsiders, and outsiders weren't allowed to hold important positions. There were consequences for those various methods of isolations, which didn't manifest themselves until ten or so divine eras later. Those consequences included the decrease of the rich clans' rankings, and some Floating Islands had even fallen into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Currently, the rich clans on the Floating Islands were quite nice to the outsiders. They also treated the outsiders they invited to work for the clans equally in many aspects.</p>

  <p>After the old man with the surname of Chen had organized the list, he left with the yellow paper.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Heavenly Han House, Malloy, took down the black halberd and returned it to Luo Zheng before he turned to everyone in the Heavenly Han House and announced, "Everyone, wait for another hour.</p>

  <p>After one hour, please move to the Consulting God Hall in the inner yard of the Heavenly Han House." Once he was done, he left as well. The test of the Heavenly Han House required him to prepare many things, so he didn't have much time to spare.</p>

  <p>When Master Wu saw that Luo Zheng had nothing left to do, he approached the young warrior. "You have imparted the mystical method for breaking the two taboos to me. I would like to know if you were the one who created this skill, or if someone else has taught you," he said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>The True Gods thought that Zheng's talent really could compare with those of the elites of the Floating Islands. Although Bruce didn't take Luo Zheng away, he left them with some rather meaningful words. In any case, he should've already known that Luo Zheng was qualified to enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Master Wu thought that such a talent like Luo Zheng really did have the ability to comprehend and create such an ingenious cultivation method.</p>

  <p>It was true that Master Evil had originally taught Luo Zheng the mystical method for breaking the two taboos. It was why Luo Zheng was unwilling to accept such a contribution and shook his head in response. "It was indeed taught to me by a master..."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what kind of person this master is. To be able to train such a remarkable disciple like you, he must have a consummate cultivation base..." Master Wu said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Consummate..." Luo Zheng whispered in slight surprise.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Master Evil laughed complacently in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I am fortunate enough to be seen as a master at the consummate stage. It is worth it to teach him the mystical method for breaking the two taboos," Master Evil uttered with a smile.</p>

  <p>It was known that a True God's cultivation base could be consummate, which meant that they could be qualified to become a Holy Being, but only when they had reached this stage.</p>

  <p>"However, this old man seems like he wants to get something out of you and figure out who is the master you have mentioned. Ha-ha!" Master Evil added as a reminder.</p>

  <p>What Master Evil said couldn't be wrong, as Luo Zheng could also tell that Master Wu looked quite interested in the 'master' that he had mentioned.</p>

  <p>Many masters had taught Luo Zheng, such as Mike, Bromley, Holy Jay, and Holy Drew. Yet due to their delicate identities, Luo Zheng couldn't possibly reveal anything.</p>

  <p>As expected, Master Wu asked a few more questions about that master's characteristics and so on. Luo Zheng did not immediately reject him, but instead falsely described the master's appearance and personality. This caused Master Wu to be lost in his thoughts in attempt to figure out that nonexistent master.</p>

  <p>Everything seemed to happen in a blur, as an hour had passed in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The old man with the surname of Chen returned and announced to the crowd, "Everyone, please follow me to the backyard of the Heavenly Han House!"</p>

  <p>The tapping of his shoes against the floor got increasingly softer as he turned around and left.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the proving godly warriors moved towards the backyard of Heavenly Han House under the guidance of the True Gods.</p>

  <p>The interiors of the Heavenly Han House were quite spacious, and everything was arranged in a neat and orderly manner. One by one, the one hundred thousand proving godly warriors filed inside in order.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked slowly along with the crowd and on his way, a few other proving godly warriors approached and tried to make friends with him.</p>

  <p>Many of them came from powerful and influential clans who, after they had realized Zheng's value, naturally understood the importance of befriending him. They believed that if Luo Zheng could enter the Floating Island and return back, he would have a much greater influence in the future.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng gave simple responses to those warriors' friendly remarks. He thought that he would not stay in the Six-Burden Divine City for long anyway.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng heard a low voice from a proving godly warrior who had approached him next.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and saw a young man in his early twenties. His body was quite sturdy, but his face looked a bit awkward.</p>

  <p>"You are..." A confused look crossed Zheng's face. He didn't know this person.</p>

  <p>"My surname is Tie and my first name is Devin," the young man replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Are you from the Tie Clan?" Luo Zheng asked with raised brows.</p>

  <p>Devin Tie quickly nodded his head and said, "My sister sold the mud to you that day, but she didn't intentionally deceive you. After the test of the Heavenly Han House, I will personally ask her to return some of the divine might coins to you..."</p>

  <p>This Devin Tie possessed a good talent and strength. He had been one of the top warriors among the three generations of the Tie Clan, but he was still ranked in the top fifty on the list.</p>

  <p>Before he took the Heavenly Han House's test, he had heard that Linn had sold a piece of mud for an outrageous price. As he was to take part in the test, he clearly had to pay attention to the rankings. Now, he felt embarrassed by what Linn had done to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>While Linn was an eloquent lady, she definitely did not do a good thing when she sold a piece of mud to Luo Zheng for five hundred divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Then again, five hundred divine might coins was still a huge sum of money for the Tie Clan. Even if Devin Tie wanted to return all of them, he didn't know if his clan members would agree or not. Therefore, he ended up saying that he would return a part of the coins to Luo Zheng, even if he didn't know how many coins yet.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Luo Zheng was not concerned about a mere five hundred divine might coins...</p>

  <p>Even though Master Evil had said that the divine might coin was still greatly useful, Luo Zheng currently did not care about it. After he had spent so many divine might coins and condensed a crystal, he figured out his method of condensing the Godly Tile. Therefore, he thought that the mud which cost him five hundred coins was worth buying.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to return the coins to me," Luo Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>Anxiety quickly flooded Devin Tie's mind when Luo Zheng had refused. "This must be..."</p>

  <p>"No need. But I want you to help me," Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>He had originally planned to find Linn from the Tie Clan after the test in the Heavenly Han House, but now he didn't need to look for her. Her brother seemed to be much more generous, and this was a good opportunity to ask him for help.</p>

  <p>"You want me to help you?" Devin Tie asked in shock. He couldn't believe what he heard.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and said in a serious tone, "I wonder where did you dig out that piece of mud? Can you take me there after the Heavenly Han House's test is over?"</p>

  <p>"That mud?"</p>

  <p>Devin Tie's eyes quickly lit up. He remembered that Alfred had always said that the mud was good, but he thought it was nothing special.</p>

  <p>Yet from Zheng's words, he was sure that he was looking for that same piece of mud. What could it be possibly for?</p>
