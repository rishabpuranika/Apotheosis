<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Star shakes the earth!"</p>

  <p>If there happened to be spectators present to watch how the battle unfolded, they would have been terribly stunned and taken aback upon seeing the intense scene of their fight.</p>

  <p>Since both of them were now tenth level war fighters, it was unexpected for them to release powers that seemed far beyond the abilities of warrior generals. Furthermore, it was even almost a frightening sight to behold, given the fact that it was impossible even for an ordinary war lord to unleash such an explosive power of forceful energy like they had just done.</p>

  <p>The potent forceful energy within Zheng's body unceasingly exploded and the power of the star flooded into his fist at the same time. After the brightness dimmed a little, his fist flashed with dazzling starlight, as if Luo Zheng was holding a small star on the palm of his hand. In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng powerfully threw a punch at his opponent.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the battle, his opponent's punch was also something to be reckoned with. Just as the potent forceful energy abruptly surged out violently from his fist and created a huge vortex, the center of it was immediately noticeable--the radiance of his fist was strikingly similar to the image of a raging seawater.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The sound of an uncontrolled flood of water was loud enough for it to leave a faint ringing in their ears. As the two powerful energies collided with each other, they consequently emitted rays of brilliant light that could have been able to make other people's eyes go blind.</p>

  <p>At this moment, it seemed to be no longer a confrontation of the fists.</p>

  <p>Rather, the battle of forceful energies had just begun; the man who rose as the victor would have won the contest of strength.</p>

  <p>Blinking rapidly as a result from the vivid brightness, Luo Zheng struggled to see his surroundings clearly. However, he understood right at that very moment that what he needed to do was to keep moving forward and tear the Soul Symbol in front of him into pieces!</p>

  <p>It was in that instance when he realized that the power of the star was far beyond what Luo Zheng could ever imagine.</p>

  <p>Upon facing the punch of the man who owned the Tower of Sin, he deliberated by himself a couple of things he had observed. Firstly, if Luo Zheng employed the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death and unleashed all of the malicious Mu Ning that was enclosed within, it might not be enough to shatter this vortex in front of him.</p>

  <p>Secondly, Luo Zheng was not certain whether the skill his opponent was using at that moment was the Transcendent Divine Might or not. Even if it were not, Luo Zheng fathomed that it was rather close to it. Moreover, the power of this vortex was not something the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death could withstand.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Luo Zheng, with the added boost from the power of the star, his punch was akin to a sharp and hot knife cutting through soft butter. Despite the fact that the light from the power of the star he emanated was considerably dim, it had never ceased to glow. Through the overwhelming energy the light spots continuously released, it did not take long before Luo Zheng finally broke the vortex and smashed his fist on the man.</p>

  <p>As the man in front of him was only a Soul Symbol and his body was merely formed by the memories that remained from it, what Luo Zheng had just defeated was not a real person in the truest sense.</p>

  <p>As a result, the exact moment Zheng's fist first landed on him, his body was immediately torn into pieces, leaving behind only a head that hovered above in the air. As the floating head continued to stare at him coldly, the man managed to give Luo Zheng a calculating leer before declaring, "Good talent and strength. You can gain the recognition of the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>"What is so good about getting the recognition of the Celestial Position?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, confused about what the other had meant.</p>

  <p>The faintest of smiles appeared on the man's face, seemingly amused at something only he knew at the time. "Actually, there are no benefits. This is your fate now."</p>

  <p>"My fate?" he stared unblinkingly. "What fate are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng inquired with a frown, more puzzled than ever.</p>

  <p>However, the floating head gradually dissipated, the sound of his voice slowly fading away into nothingness. Nevertheless, Zheng's ears managed to pick up on the last sentence the man had uttered before disappearing completely, "When the time comes, you will know. Do not weep then..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the parting words of his former opponent, Luo Zheng was perplexed by what the underlying meaning of his message could have been. "Do not weep when the time comes?" he repeated softly, crossing his arms against his chest. "What did that even mean?" Luo Zheng muttered to himself as he started to stroke his chin absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>Alas, no one was present to directly answer Zheng's questions. After the Soul Symbol had completely disappeared without a trace, Luo Zheng once again stood alone in the endless space.</p>

  <p>Absorbed in his own thoughts, Luo Zheng almost missed the weapon spirit's voice as it suddenly resounded from everywhere. "Young man, you have passed the ultimate test," the voice declared.</p>

  <p>"What is my reward?" Even after having entered the test for so long, Luo Zheng still had trouble trying to understand what exactly was going on around him. Feeling bouts of irritation ever since it had started, he just wished that all these masters he had encountered just explicitly told him what they wanted to convey in the first place. Looking back at what he experienced, the owner of the Tower of Sin behaved in the exact same way as the immortal Mist did. Their tendency to suddenly drop the topic when it came to the most important and intriguing part, along with leaving Luo Zheng hanging in suspense, annoyed him to no end. Upon reminiscing on his past escapades, he rubbed his temples in frustration--if he could only curse them!</p>

  <p>"After you pass the ultimate test, you can then enjoy being the highest authority in the Tower of Sin. You are now free to travel within the premises, as well as control everything that happens inside the tower," the voice explained, addressing Zheng's concerns.</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>Emotions of surprise and satisfaction bubbled up in his chest at the news presented to him. "Doesn't this mean that the Tower of Sin now belongs to me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no. The Tower of Sin is not something you can refine as only the Celestial Position race can do so," the weapon spirit started to clarify. "You have just gained the recognition of the Celestial Position. Since it is impossible for you to refine it with your current strength, you can only control the tower within a limited range with my help, of course." the formless voice finished, patiently giving Luo Zheng a well-deserved explanation.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Can you explain further? Give me an example perhaps?"</p>

  <p>The young man persistently asked, fascinated by what he was currently hearing.</p>

  <p>"For example, you can now freely travel through the walls and floors of the Tower of Sin without anyone or anything stopping you on your way. Also, you can kick any living creature out of the Tower of Sin," the weapon spirit stated and completed its spiel.</p>

  <p>As the voice finished talking, Zheng's eyebrows immediately shot up and his mouth was agape at the implications of his new status. Grinning with unbridled excitement, Luo Zheng felt his heart pound in anticipation of his new privileges.</p>

  <p>With a start, it dawned on him that he ultimately had the right to decide who got to live or die among all the creatures in the Tower of Sin.</p>
