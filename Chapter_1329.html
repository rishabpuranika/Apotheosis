<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Hearing Fenton's words, Luo Zheng clapped his hands out of the blue.</p>

  <p>Not many people had such a state of mind— Fenton's attitude earned Zheng's admiration.</p>

  <p>It was the attitude of a true master.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng did not know what the alliance was all about, judging from the crowd's expressions, he figured it was a great place in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>But for a warrior living in this world, believing in oneself was crucial.</p>

  <p>Gold will shine no matter where it is. While it would be good if there was a shortcut to take, it would be putting the cart before the horse if one completely relied on everyone or everything else instead of oneself.</p>

  <p>"That's right. I couldn't agree more," said Luo Zheng with a smile as he stood up.</p>

  <p>Calmly, Fenton returned, "I don't need your approval."</p>

  <p>"Indeed. But I accept your challenge!" Luo Zheng said nonetheless.</p>

  <p>"Good. I appreciate your courage as well." Fenton nodded in response.</p>

  <p>Never did he think he would ever lose. Even being at the Life and Death Realm, he had gone through nine small Heavenly Tribulations. While he hadn't opened up a Soul Sea, his strength far exceeded that of any ordinary warrior of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>If he lost to a warrior at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm, he'd seem like a joke. Even if Luo Zheng was chosen by the Heavenly Alliance, perhaps he had used some special way to make it happen. But for Fenton, it was unimportant.</p>

  <p>"He agreed! This brat actually accepted the challenge!"</p>

  <p>"Haha! I can't say I like Fenton going ahead and challenging the brat, but I'm still looking forward to seeing this guy get crushed!"</p>

  <p>"He looks calm and composed now…I can't wait to see him beg for mercy once he gets beaten by Fenton!"</p>

  <p>All of the martial artists in the Myriad Spiritual Force House seemed to get riled up— they could all tell that another good show was about to unfold.</p>

  <p>The ignorant brat from the Lower World had no clue what he was in for, but the talents of the Myriad Spiritual Force House were all well aware of Fenton's strength. So it wasn't only Fenton who was extremely confident in himself, it was all the warriors there— the blind faith they had in him was rather overwhelming.</p>

  <p>"In that case… this way, please!" Fenton gestured with his hand as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng leave the corner.</p>

  <p>It was the first time since he entered the Myriad Spiritual Force House that he even stood from his spot.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then followed after Fenton as they walked along the Myriad Spiritual Force House, the other warriors gathering to follow behind them.</p>

  <p>"You're still in closed-door cultivation? Hurry up and come out! Fenton is going to fight!"</p>

  <p>"Fight?" "Yeah, he's going to teach some newcomer from the Lower World a lesson, haha!"</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a good show to see… I'm coming!"</p>

  <p>The news of Fenton challenging Luo Zheng spread like wildfire through the Holy City through the communication tokens.</p>

  <p>Even some of the disciples of the Myriad Spiritual Force House who were in the middle of practicing couldn't resist rushing over.</p>

  <p>As for the disciples in closed-door cultivation, they hurriedly packed up and hurried over.</p>

  <p>Those in the Holy City were the most anxious— the city was simply too big. Because they couldn't easily rush back, all they could do was find the nearest transmission array to head back. While they did, they prayed that Fenton would show some mercy to his opponent. It was all they could do to hope that the warrior who had just ascended from the Lower World would be strong enough to hold on for a little longer until they arrived.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng followed his opponent, the crowd behind them seemed to grow.</p>

  <p>From only about a hundred onlookers, their audience grew to a thousand, then two thousand, three thousand, and even four thousand…</p>

  <p>Seeing the huge crowd behind him, Luo Zheng was rendered speechless. Most were at the Soul Sea Realm, and only a few seemed to be at the Life and Death Realm. Never did he think that the people in the Upper World would make such a big fuss over a trivial thing.</p>

  <p>After entering the depths of the Myriad Spiritual Force House, Fenton led Luo Zheng into a large hall.</p>

  <p>"Is it alright to spar in this hall?" Although the grand hall in front of Luo Zheng was spacious, it wasn't nearly enough to contain warriors of their level— when they sparred, they could topple mountains and overturn seas.</p>

  <p>Within a few moves, they could easily end up blowing off the roof.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's question drew a wave of laughter from the crowd behind him.</p>

  <p>"He really is a bumpkin from the Lower World!"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't even know about Illusion Space…"</p>

  <p>"Hmph! This guy is so ignorant. Well, he came from a small place, what kind of things can you really expect him to know?"</p>

  <p>Hearing the insults, Luo Zheng merely pursed his lips and forced a smile.</p>

  <p>But Fenton didn't mock him. Instead, he pointed to the two diamond-shaped jade symbols floating in the middle of the hall. "This is the Dragon Tiger Hall, a place for our martial artists to spar with each other.</p>

  <p>Here, there is an Illusion Space where our reflections can be projected.</p>

  <p>All our weapons, treasures, and cultivation methods will be duplicated in this space— everything only a reflection. This way, when we spar with each other, we can fight without holding back and nobody would get hurt."</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng easily understood why he was brought there. "So this is a magic array?"</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Fenton nodded and said, "You can understand it that way, but this Illusion Space isn't exactly the same as a magic array."</p>

  <p>Magic arrays created a lot illusions— warriors' bodies could be covered in them. As for the Illusion Space, it took advantage of the fifth layer of Space Law, 'Refraction', which could project a martial artist's own reflection into it. Much like when looking into a mirror, the reflection of the martial artists could enter that particular space to fight, along with all of their weapons and anything attached to their bodies.</p>

  <p>From this perspective, the Illusion Space was much more complex than the magic array.</p>

  <p>Fenton didn't bother explaining too much to Luo Zheng— there was nothing wrong with Luo Zheng thinking it was a magic array.</p>

  <p>"Well then… How do we start?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Fenton made the pair of diamond-shaped symbols float the Dragon Tiger Hall. When they flew over, he extended his hand and lightly pushed the symbols toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You must pour your life vitality into it to enter the Illusion Space,"</p>

  <p>Fenton explained.</p>

  <p>Hesitation seemed to appear in Zheng's expression. Once he entered the space, everything about him would be duplicated— did that mean his secrets would be leaked as well? It was quite a dilemma because Luo Zheng was well aware that there were some secrets that couldn't be exposed no matter what.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's hesitant expression, Fenton had a moment of thought. As if he could read Zheng's mind, he said, "The Illusion Space is only using the Space Law. It doesn't copy your body by fully understanding you, so it won't remember anything you wish to hide. It's the same as looking into a mirror."</p>

  <p>A mirror could clearly reflect a person's image, but it did not store anything about that person before it.</p>

  <p>Zheng's misgivings were dispelled by that single metaphor. But in his moment of hesitation, he became an object of universal derision.</p>

  <p>"This warrior from the Lower World is so cautious…he's probably too afraid of his secret getting exposed!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder how much that secret is worth…"</p>

  <p>"The poor tend to scurry for a place to hide… you should get used to it!"</p>

  <p>Still, Zheng's concerns were justified.</p>

  <p>Not to mention the furnace in his mind, nor the Heavenly Fragment— if the Roaring Token were to be revealed, he'd be stuck in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>Even Supreme Lords would go crazy over a Roaring Token with limitless uses— Luo Zheng had every reason to be extra careful.</p>

  <p>Not minding the derision, Luo Zheng calmed himself down instead and activated the diamond-shaped jade symbols.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng activated them, he suddenly found himself sinking into another space.</p>

  <p>But he wasn't actually entering another space. Remaining where he stood in the Dragon Tiger Hall, he created an identical main body through reflection.</p>

  <p>'This Illusion Space is truly interesting…one can fight with all his might here. Even when you're killed off, only the projection dies. Avoiding any real damage, we won't have any scruples going all out!' Luo Zheng thought in delight.</p>

  <p>A slight smile tugging at his lips, Luo Zheng examined his surroundings. Where he stood, it was incomparably spacious— there was no end in sight.</p>

  <p>Fenton's figure quietly appeared in the space, standing not too far away, just as his reflection entered the Illusion Space.</p>
