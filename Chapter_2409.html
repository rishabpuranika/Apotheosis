<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The guards stared starry-eyed at the original Sanskrit word in Zheng's hand for eight impossibly long seconds.</p>

  <p>Coming to his senses, one guard looked at Zheng with the utmost respect. He pointed at the paper in Zheng's hand. "Can I make a copy, sir?"</p>

  <p>The paper didn't record sensitive information so Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The guard, not expecting Zheng to be so kind, was overjoyed. He quickly took out a pale yellow stone tablet from his space ring and thanked Zheng profusely.</p>

  <p>On the back of the stone tablet was a simple divine texture.</p>

  <p>If a person aimed the blank side of this stone tablet at another person, after activating the divine texture, they would be able to copy the other person's appearance.</p>

  <p>And not only that. If one aimed the stone tablet at a mountain, they would be able to make a copy of the mountain's appearance.</p>

  <p>The stone tablet was convenient like that, and many True Gods kept a few stone tablets in their space rings in case they needed to copy some good golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The guard aimed the stone tablet at the emerald green paper. A wave of energy came from his hand and the divine texture on the stone tablet began to glow. At the same time, a Sanskrit word identical to the one on the paper appeared on the blank side of the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>"Eh, what's this? It's very interesting." Curiosity appeared on Zheng's face when he saw the stone tablet. He had never seen such a thing before.</p>

  <p>"This is a duplicating stone tablet," the guard laughed good naturedly. "It's just an ordinary item in our Sunrest Tree Region. I can give you some if you want."</p>

  <p>The guard then reached out his hand, and a stack of pale yellow stone tablets appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>This kind of stone came from the sea below the Sunrest Tree. The True Gods took the stones in the bottom of the sea, cut them into thin pieces, and drew divine textures on them, enabling them to achieve such a strange ability.</p>

  <p>However, the duplicating stone tablets could only be kept for a period of time. About two years after a duplicating stone tablet was drawn from the sea of the Sunrest Tree Region, it would be completely useless.</p>

  <p>This was why the duplicating stone tablets were not spread everywhere in the divine land, and Zheng had never seen them before.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and took the pile of duplicating stone tablets from the guard. He studied the tablets briefly and thanked the guard, about to enter the city.</p>

  <p>However, before he could take one step, he saw the other guards and dozens of True Gods looking at him eagerly.</p>

  <p>They all had pitiful looks in their eyes. Even if they didn't speak, it wasn't hard to figure out what they wanted. All of them wanted to copy his original Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>Most True Gods had never seen an original Sanskrit word their whole lives.</p>

  <p>This was a once in a blue moon opportunity, and Zheng was very generous and willing to let the guards make the copy. They'd be fools to let such an opportunity go to waste.</p>

  <p>In fact, even the old man and the young man standing on the city wall, at this moment, had the impulse to run down to copy the original Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can copy his Sanskrit word," Zheng said with a pout before he bowed his head and left.</p>

  <p>He had attracted so many people in such a short time. If he allowed them all to make copies from his original, he might not be able to enter the city within the day!</p>

  <p>The city of the Sword Clan was very peaceful.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because this was the Non-combat Zone, that the True Gods in this place were less hostile and did not easily get into disputes. And even if there was a really big conflict, the most they could do was glare at each other. At most, they could only teach the other party a lesson with their words.</p>

  <p>In this way, the True Gods of the Sunrest Tree Region could spend more time on cultivation and comprehension, and were more secluded than warriors in the other lands.</p>

  <p>Because the debate over the Godly Ways was about to begin, the city streets were crowded with True Gods from the divine land.</p>

  <p>Sanskrit words were originally commodities that had been widely circulated in the divine land. In each divine city, there were people interpreting and trading in Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen this before when he was in the ancestral land of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Now, almost all of these sellers had come to the Sunrest Tree Region. It was very lively.</p>

  <p>Along the way, there were True Gods arranging a pile of golden Sanskrit words with different shapes on both sides of the road. Some common golden Sanskrit words were randomly placed on the ground, while some rare ones were covered by exquisite transparent jade tablets. In order to prevent people from copying the words, the surfaces of the jade tablets were blurred.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a great variety of golden Sanskrit words attracted Zheng's interest.</p>

  <p>Most of the contents of the golden Sanskrit words were worthless. There were times that after countless years of studying them, one's efforts would only be in vain. Therefore, even if a True God possessed some rare Sanskrit words, they wouldn't spend a lot of time and energy in studying them.</p>

  <p>But this wasn't a problem for Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>In fact, cracking Sanskrit words was as easy as eating and drinking water for him, so Zheng wanted to buy some Sanskrit words for his son to figure out.</p>

  <p>If some Sanskrit words contained the Truth of Godly Way, or even some peculiar and precious contents, it would be a great luck for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes swept along the stalls as he thought about this.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to him, the old man in white and the young man had quietly followed behind him.</p>

  <p>"He looks like he wants to buy some Sanskrit words," the young man observed, a weird expression on his face.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Zheng was not an ordinary person, so it baffled them as to why he'd be interested in the common Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The old man also shook his head. "I can't figure him out. Perhaps he wants to find some rare Sanskrit words by chance?"</p>

  <p>"By chance? Are you kidding me, old man? You know what things these guys have. The Sanskrit words in their hands are rare, yes, but they're almost impossible to crack. They're practically worthless!" The young man smiled disdainfully.</p>

  <p>"Indeed. It's impossible for us to crack them, but maybe this young man can..."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they had found that they had guessed right.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly stopped at a stall managed by a middle-aged guy with long facial hair and dark skin.</p>

  <p>Apart from humans, there were also many other races in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, after the members of these races became True Gods, their features would be no different from ordinary people's unless they deliberately kept their own characteristics.</p>

  <p>The store owner lowered his head and squinted his beady eyes. He looked lifeless, but there was no mistaking the shrewd look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>A row of exquisite brocade boxes were placed in front of Zheng. The surface of the boxes revealed seven vague golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>'These golden Sanskrit words...'</p>

  <p>When Zheng noticed a Sanskrit word in front of him, his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen this word once.</p>

  <p>To be exact, he had seen half of this golden Sanskrit word in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>His son had told him that that golden Sanskrit word should be a kind of Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, because there was only half of the golden Sanskrit word, the Truth of Godly Way Geoffrey had cracked was incomplete.</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng had actually found the other half of golden Sanskrit word!</p>

  <p>More importantly, the mind method of Truth of Godly Way that Zheng had cultivated was from a group of six golden Sanskrit words, and the seven golden Sanskrit words in front of the middle-aged man looked like they were a group too.</p>

  <p>'Is this also a complete set of Truth of Godly Way?' Zheng's heart thumped wildly in his chest. His fingers drummed against his thigh, barely able to contain the excitement.</p>

  <p>Not far away, the young man and the old man in white saw the irrepressible excitement on Zheng's face, and a strange expression appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand this guy..."</p>

  <p>"He knows so much about Sanskrit words, but why doesn't he know anything about the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River?"</p>

  <p>The Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River were the group of seven Sanskrit words on the stall.</p>

  <p>The first time the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River had appeared was in the 17th divine era, on the side of the famous Lorena River, on the west side of the divine land. And with its appearance came great chaos in the divine land.</p>
