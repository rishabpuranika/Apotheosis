<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back then, Zheng had first met Feng Ge at the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>Some time later, Zheng returned home after obtaining the Shade Stone, only to find out that Xun, Liusu, and Nelly had been "invited" by Feng Ge to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Furious, he had stormed the Phoenix Palace to face Feng Ge right then and there.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the three women were actually quite content there, so Zheng didn't force them to come back. However, now, Feng Ge had invited Yudie and Margaret. What was she up to?</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me in advance?" Zheng frowned deeply.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge smiled apologetically. "I thought they were bored in the Flow Sword Sect, so I invited them to the Phoenix Palace. Besides, you were busy practicing in seclusion the other day, so I didn't get the chance to tell you."</p>

  <p>The Phoenix Palace was not a dangerous place after all, and to a certain extent, it was actually safer than the Flow Sword Sect. Still, it was a bit suspicious that Feng Ge was being courteous to Yudie and Margaret.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. He couldn't figure it out.</p>

  <p>He just said, "Forget it. Let's just refine the Body-strengthening Jade."</p>

  <p>"Okay." Feng Ge nodded meekly.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought he saw a hint of amusement in her eyes, but it quickly disappeared. She then concentrated on crushing the Body-strengthening Jade for her body to absorb it.</p>

  <p>Just like Zheng, refining the Body-strengthening Jade was easy for Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>It was more efficient to strengthen the corporeal body than to enhance the Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>For Zheng, strengthening his corporeal body meant he could use it outside the Other Shore. Feng Ge, on the other hand, couldn't bring her corporeal body outside the Other Shore, so it seemed a bit wasteful to strengthen it.</p>

  <p>However, after occupying the Myriad Spirits City, Zheng had obtained a lot of resources. Even after he distributed some to the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, there was still a lot of leftover.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to continue refining the Body-strengthening Jade, a bright yellow shadow darted into his line of sight. When his eyes adjusted to the figure approaching him, he realized it was the leader of the Guide Weasel race, Clyde.</p>

  <p>"Sir, something is happening in the Sky Water City," Clyde reported anxiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>These days, the Guide Weasel race had been closely observing the movements of the Sky Water City. No matter what the news was, they would report everything to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng asked with one eyebrow raised.</p>

  <p>"The elite members of the Star Falcon race are coming straight to the Myriad Spirits City." Clyde's small, beady eyes looked serious as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race was able to occupy the Sky Water City, and their strength was far greater than that of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race. In the past few years, the Star Falcon race had also thought of attacking the Myriad Spirits City, but it would cause a lot of trouble, so the two races had been living a relatively peaceful time.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, because of Zheng and Feng Ge, the Star Falcon race decided now was the time to strike. In Clyde's eyes, they were a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>However, to the Guide Weasel race, while this might have seemed like imminent doom, it was also a rare opportunity.</p>

  <p>If Zheng wiped out the elite members of the Star Falcon race, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race would be able to counterattack and take charge of the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>So when Clyde saw the elite members of the Star Falcon race come out, he excitedly raced to Zheng to tell him the news.</p>

  <p>Zheng handed over the Body-strengthening Jade to Feng Ge, who tucked it into her space ring. Looking up to the sky, Zheng asked, "How long before they arrive?"</p>

  <p>"With the speed of the Star Falcon race, roughly two hours," Clyde replied.</p>

  <p>"We're ready to fight at any time!"</p>

  <p>Knowing Zheng and Feng Ge were incredibly powerful, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race were confident. Banking on the two's strength, they were willing to go all out.</p>

  <p>"Good. Ask all the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to leave the Other Shore. You, come with me to the gate of the city." Zheng stood up and walked out of the City Guard House, with Feng Ge at his heels.</p>

  <p>Standing at the gate, Zheng had an overlooking view of the broad plain in the distance.</p>

  <p>The purple light was dancing in the sky. It was constantly giving off pressure. The Souls of Light could feel the coldness if they were shrouded in the purple light, but when it struck on Zheng's body, it was like a piece of hot charcoal, causing a faint burning sensation from time to time.</p>

  <p>On the city wall, the mole crickets, carrying Green Kylin Bows in their hands, stood still. They were the aboriginals of the Myriad Spirits City, and they had always obeyed the orders of the City Guard House. After Zheng took over the City Guard House, they became somewhat like his private soldiers.</p>

  <p>In addition to the mole crickets as archers, many Giants who held massive clubs also stood on the city wall. They looked menacing, as though a swing of a club would break down half the city wall.</p>

  <p>As for the members of the Guide Weasel race, they were hiding on both sides of the city wall. Like the Ear Mice, they were small, so they were not suitable for direct combat. However, they were agile and nimble; their secret tactic was to land fatal blows up close, which was extremely hard to guard against.</p>

  <p>Roughly an hour later, there was a dot of light in the distance, as though a star suddenly lit up. In the blink of an eye, many more stars appeared, dotting the broad plain before them.</p>

  <p>"What beautiful stars!" Feng Ge said under her breath.</p>

  <p>"They are not stars," said Clyde, who overheard her. "They are Star Falcons. They're almost upon us!"</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon was a very ferocious bird, with a dazzling star-like diamond embedded on its chest.</p>

  <p>As the Star Falcons got closer and closer, Feng Ge could see their wings flapping with the wind.</p>

  <p>"You stay here and don't leave the city wall," Zheng suddenly said to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't know how to fly. Even though she had a strong body as a purified being, it was still risky for her to face the Star Falcon race.</p>

  <p>"Fine." Feng Ge frowned slightly. She didn't like to feel useless in times of trouble.</p>

  <p>"Thirty thousand feet!" Clyde announced.</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand feet!"</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand feet!"</p>

  <p>Clyde narrowed his beady eyes at the flying figures closing in on them.</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand feet! Shoot!" he commanded the archers.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Like green rain, arrows whizzed through the air towards the Star Falcons.</p>

  <p>From the receiving end of the arrows, the largest Star Falcon at the forefront squinted at the city wall.</p>

  <p>It was the leader of the Star Falcon race, Hans.</p>

  <p>Thanks to their exceptional vision, the Star Falcons could see the figures on the wall of the Myriad Spirits City clearly.</p>

  <p>Finally, Hans' eyes landed on what he was looking for. "Strange," Hans murmured. "The two targets are in plain sight."</p>

  <p>He didn't care about the failures of the Ghost Scorpion and the Dark Bear race.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race was above all the races in the Light Region of Stage Fourteen; they were the rulers there.</p>

  <p>The second Hans received the request from the Sun Crow race, he had agreed with no hesitation. It seemed to be a good opportunity to invade the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Unbothered by the volley of arrows coming straight for him, Hans simply flapped his wide wings.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A strong wind blew from Hans' incredible wings, sending the arrows backwards till they plummeted to the ground.</p>
