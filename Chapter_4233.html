</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the Snake Goddess's words, Eastern Emperor Taiyi smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"You forgot that his real body is in the primitive land. We'll know for sure once we go take a look."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Let's go back!" As she spoke, the Snake Goddess began to chant the Illusion Breaking Rune to retreat from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The sudden disappearance of the Jade Pure Realm had shocked her beyond measure, and she had momentarily forgotten that Luo Zheng's physical body was in the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Once they returned to the primitive land, they utilized the Grand Teleportation to return to the jadeite platform on the Li Shan mountain. Luo Zheng was still there sitting upright, his face ruddy but calm, and his breathing even.</p>

  <p>The life energy within his body was flowing in all directions. This would make ordinary people feel refreshed if they got close to him and could extend their life span.</p>

  <p>It was truly a relief to see that Luo Zheng was safe and sound.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng had risen to prominence within the Source World, they had come to know his importance. They knew he was their only hope, that no other would do. If he perished, everything would become meaningless.</p>

  <p>"The Jade Pure Realm is gone. Where could Luo Zheng be hiding?"</p>

  <p>"With his theurgies, he should have entered some sort of space..."</p>

  <p>"Even so, he should have returned already. Why wouldn't he have woken up yet?"</p>

  <p>Both spoken words and silent thoughts were revolving around Luo Zheng's possible situation.</p>

  <p>On the jadeite platform, Judson, Gerald and Kendrick, also joined the discussion.</p>

  <p>Since they knew nothing of what happened to the Jade Pure Realm, their discussion went nowhere, so they anxiously waited for Luo Zheng to awaken.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they didn't have to wait for too long. Several hours later, Luo Zheng's eyes slowly blinked open.</p>

  <p>"Finally! You're awake."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you alright?"</p>

  <p>"What on earth happened on the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>They crowded around him, throwing a barrage of questions at him without pause.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Zheng wasn't sure how to answer or if he should, but then he asked, "Where is Madam Ying?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy cared the most about Ying. She had entered the door to save her grandmother, but Luo Zheng had already rescued Ying from the Other Shore before Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Madam Ying is in the Sword Reading Peak. Why? What's wrong?" the Snake Goddess asked, confused.</p>

  <p>Many things should have occurred on the Other Shore, but she wasn't sure why any of those things would have a thing to do with Ying. Why did Luo Zheng ask for her the moment he woke up?</p>

  <p>"Someone wishes to see her. Please ask her to come," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was surprised, and she had to take a moment to think over what he had said. "Dorothy is still alive?" Her voice betrayed her shock at the news.</p>

  <p>She was already aware of Dorothy's disappearance. If there was anyone on the Other Shore who wanted to see Ying, it could only be Dorothy.</p>

  <p>But why would Dorothy be in the Jade Pure Realm?</p>

  <p>Did the destruction of the Jade Pure Realm have anything to do with her?</p>

  <p>"I will explain it later," said Luo Zheng softly.</p>

  <p>With that answer, the Snake Goddess didn't bother to press the issue. She shifted into a bright beam of light, and transported to the Sword Reading Peak to send for Ying.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced around before asking, "Where are the Descending Rings?"</p>

  <p>The Descending Rings were used to connect the Other Shore and the chaos. Some rings were in the hands of the real Snake Goddess and the human heroes on the Other Shore, but when they had needed the rings to work, they failed. After their failure, they had been devoured by the massive energy balls.</p>

  <p>Fuxi quickly took out the Descending Rings and put them in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What had once been pure golden rings were now deformed and tarnished, their surface pitted and cracked. With the destruction of the Descending Rings on the Other Shore, the real ones in the primitive land had also been severely affected.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took the three rings, and brought them closer to him. Then he raised his head and said, "Assist me in repairing them."</p>

  <p>Energy fluctuations burst from the blood red sky, and a brilliant golden light was born from it that illuminated the three Descending Rings.</p>

  <p>When the light touched them, a soft humming sound echoed around them.</p>

  <p>The bright golden light began to become more solid, condensing into a single column as it healed the Descending Rings. In a short moment, that felt like forever, they were as good as new. As if they had never been damaged before.</p>

  <p>When the healing light had faded, another two streaks of light shot through the sky at them from the foot of the mountain. It was Ying and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! I was told someone wanted to see me. Is it Dorothy?" Ying asked seriously, a hint of hope in her tone. Fear was etched within the wrinkles of her face. She was afraid of the possible answer.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's her," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ying visibly deflated with relief.</p>

  <p>She was old, and had lived long enough in her opinion.</p>

  <p>She didn't care much for the fights occurring on the Other Shore or the fate of the chaos. Not every Eternal Realm warrior was as selfless as the Snake Goddess and Fuxi, who fought for the world and those living in it until they couldn't anymore.</p>

  <p>There was only one person that Ying cared for and that was Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Ever since Dorothy had disappeared through the door, Ying had no news of her and had fallen into a period of depression living alone within the Sword Reading Peak, This unexpected news gave her hope.</p>

  <p>"Where is she? Where is my granddaughter?" asked Ying in a rush.</p>

  <p>Holding the Descending Rings carefully in his hands, Luo Zheng closed his eyes and started to activate the Truth of Divine Dao. "You will see her soon."</p>

  <p>The air picked up around them, whistling softly.</p>

  <p>The next moment, Luo Zheng appeared in the passageway within the door.</p>

  <p>Without a word or hesitation, Luo Zheng handed the rings to Dorothy, Kincaid and Hilario respectively and the three of them began to descend.</p>

  <p>The air grew warm, and a soft buzzing sound reached their ears.</p>

  <p>Three figures were outlined below the Descending Rings, one for each ring.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy attempted to regain her senses after leaving the Other Shore, she could hear someone calling her name. Her expression crumpled and tears welled in her eyes, "Grandma!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy threw herself into her grandmother's arms. Although she was the reincarnation of the daughter of Kincaid, and there was a small connection between them, Ying was the one she loved dearly.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the Chaos Ancient Gods all focused their eyes beyond the reunion to Kincaid and Hilario.</p>

  <p>It was a white-haired monster and a Treacherous Being standing there.</p>

  <p>The faint aura they were releasing was making the others feel stressed and anxious.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi had seen the human spirits who were in the form of Treacherous Beings before. For example, the warriors of the three houses of the Human Spirit Sect on the Night View Island. However, even Hamilton and Alphonse were far from being able to compare with this one in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, why don't you introduce them to us?" the Snake Goddess said, not looking away from the two strangers.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could reply, Dorothy gestured to Kincaid. "Grandma, this is my father!"</p>

  <p>"Your father?" Ying asked in clear disbelief.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "This is the Human Spirit King, Master Kincaid, Dorothy's father, and this is Hilario, the leader of the Bold Conjecture House."</p>

  <p>The Human Spirit King was a very famous figure as well as the goal of Luo Zheng's trip to the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Kincaid nodded at Ying and said, "Thank you for taking care of Dorothy in the chaos."</p>

  <p>The Human Spirit King Kincaid...</p>

  <p>Dorothy's father...</p>

  <p>Ying was dumbfounded. Although she knew that Dorothy's origin was extraordinary, she was beyond amazed that her father could be the Human Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The expressions of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others were similar: utter surprise. After a short period of silence, they raised their hands in a salute.</p>

  <p>"I'm Snake Goddess. It's a pleasure to meet you, Master Kincaid..."</p>

  <p>"I'm Fuxi. Greetings..."</p>

  <p>"My name is..."</p>

  <p>Kincaid waved his hand and said, "You don't need to be so courteous. You all have helped me. It is thanks to you that I am still alive and could wake up!"</p>

  <p>"We're blessed by the Deep Space. I didn't expect that our human spirits would be saved by the human race in the end..." Hilario said softly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then went on to tell them what happened in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>Only then did the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others know the truth.</p>

  <p>"Then the real versions of ourselves... are all dead?" Fuxi said, his eyes wide. He had never expected their situation to turn so tragic.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess on the other hand was as calm as ever. Her sharp mind was going over everything that had been said before she said, "So if what you say is true, and the sword fell into the hands of the downgrader, aren't we all doomed to lose then?</p>

  <p>"That is why we came here. We are searching for an opportunity to reverse the situation," Kincaid replied.</p>

  <p>"Is there such an opportunity in the primitive land? Perhaps it is the ancestry-level bloodline?" the Snake Goddess asked, brows scrunched in confusion.</p>

  <p>"It's not the ancestry-level bloodline," Luo Zheng said as he pointed in the direction of the Ruin Graveyard. "Our opportunity lies there."</p>
