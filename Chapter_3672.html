<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3672 Insist </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were a few records stating that Lord Shaw was killed by the Heart of Accomplice, and no one had ever burned this heart.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the Heart of Accomplice began to burn, so did the entire body of Heller.</p>

  <p>This was a special reaction of energy, only possible with the heart.</p>

  <p>Aside from it being rare, it was also severe torture. Even Heller, a powerful warrior who had reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, couldn't find it in himself to endure it.</p>

  <p>However, though his face expressed pain, his eyes shone excitement.</p>

  <p>He was just happy that a loser like him could still help Eastern Emperor Taiyi before he died.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As Heller's body burned, a wave of fright struck Ware.</p>

  <p>Just then, a sharp pain pierced through his back that sent a burning sensation all over. Apparently, this was the consequence of Heller burning the Other Shore Token and violating the truth.</p>

  <p>"Help... Please help me..." Ware wailed in pain.</p>

  <p>The strong warriors surrounding him were stunned, their faces shifting from confident to serious.</p>

  <p>But no matter how much Ware cried out for help desperately, they didn't help him. Instead, they kept retreating backwards.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!"</p>

  <p>"Kill that old man and we might be able to save Master Ware!"</p>

  <p>"Attack!"</p>

  <p>These people knew that it was all because of Heller. If they killed him, they could save Ware.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, two men soared down from the air. The one on the left held a spear, while the one on the right held a halberd.</p>

  <p>"Don't, don't kill him..."</p>

  <p>Ware pleaded in agony. If Heller died, he would definitely die along with him.</p>

  <p>However, his voice was too weak for anyone to hear. Meanwhile, the two men were so determined to save his life that they didn't hold back. A bright light flashed and the spear and halberd turned into two beams of lightning that pierced through Heller's body.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>In one instant, Heller was sliced cleanly into two pieces, and so was Ware.</p>

  <p>However, as this happened, the burning did not ever cease.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, the two were burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>In front of the Phoenix Palace, Flamine paused and looked up into the sky, her face filled with grief.</p>

  <p>The reason why Eastern Emperor Taiyi was able to expand the Oneness Sky Palace was that he'd been assisted by loyal elders. It seemed that until their very last breaths, the elders played their roles to the fullest extent.</p>

  <p>Right in the sky, the strong warriors of the Bearing race had to witness Ware die, but they could do nothing to stop it.</p>

  <p>After a long silence, Hancock cocked his head and spoke out, "Since Master Ware has died, we have no choice but to break the array by force. Although it is difficult to break the Three-Element Sword Array, there is still a solution! Guys, come on! We shouldn't lose hope!"</p>

  <p>Although everyone had been weary from Ware's death, Hancock's words easily lightened up their moods.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi still stayed hidden in the Supreme Dragon Hall below. As long as they destroyed the final array, they could kill him so easily. It was their final goal.</p>

  <p>"It's just an array. We must work together to break it!"</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be so difficult to get rid of that woman who guards the array!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, come with me!" People screamed and cheered in confidence.</p>

  <p>Just then, a small oil pot appeared and hovered over Hancock's head. A flame burned in the mouth of the pot. This was a famous treasure that produced endless flames using blood.</p>

  <p>Hancock took out a small blade and sliced a small part of his wrist. He then held his wrist over the pot, letting the blood drip. Then he grabbed the oil pot and made its mouth face the array.</p>

  <p>Instead of blood, black fire oil poured out of the pot.</p>

  <p>This fusion of fire and oil helped him form a huge flame waterfall.</p>

  <p>Though the flame seemed like any other flame, it had astonishing power to never go out. Once it was attached to something, it would never extinguish unless the oil burnt out.</p>

  <p>"Guards!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the flames, Flamine spun around and summoned the guards for help.</p>

  <p>With one word from Flamine, one guard jumped up and an icy blue vortex appeared above his head. This vortex caused a huge icy storm that swept over the fire oil, forming an ice column more than ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>However, because the fire oil was so powerful, it would only melt the ice column eventually.</p>

  <p>Another guard who observed for a while decided that it was time for him to take action. A pair of jade swords appeared in his hands, and with continuous tapping of the swords, a dozen runes circled around the ice column.</p>

  <p>Once the runes stabilized, the flames began to seal.</p>

  <p>Hancock saw this and grinned. "Although your method is ingenious, do you really think you can block all of us?"</p>

  <p>On his cue, the people behind him began to let go all the theurgies they had.</p>

  <p>This went on for a minute.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed.</p>

  <p>An hour...</p>

  <p>Four hours...</p>

  <p>The attack never stopped, and there was no sign of it slowing down anytime soon.</p>

  <p>Although Flamine was safe under the protection of the Three-Element Sword Array, she seemed drained as ever.</p>

  <p>Aside from her, the two men with the Earth Sword and the Human Sword also appeared tired.</p>

  <p>At this point, everyone's theurgies sent out thousands of divine megatons of force. Some of the methods were strange, so they had to constantly change their array to deal with them. Even if Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood in the array for hours, there would be a point wherein he would not be able to withstand the attacks, let alone Flamine.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine can't hold on much longer."</p>

  <p>"Lady Jean, could you replace her?"</p>

  <p>"I... I can't control the Three-Element Sword Array."</p>

  <p>"It's very difficult to control the Heaven Sword. I'm afraid I can't do it either."</p>

  <p>Seeing Flamine grow weaker after blocking each attack, everyone behind her grew worried. At this rate, the array would be broken in no time.</p>

  <p>It came to a point that the people in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall had begun to lose hope.</p>

  <p>Was this it? Was the Oneness Sky Palace going to be defeated?</p>

  <p>Sadly, Pearce and Auden, who led the masters of the seven mountain, died in the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>They had no more reinforcements and no more miracles. They had hoped for a second that Eastern Emperor Taiyi would wake up, but he seemed nowhere close to consciousness.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Pearce led the group of warriors to open up a space channel.</p>

  <p>After they had traveled it for a while, they reached the wall between the provinces.</p>

  <p>As the group followed Pearce, they passed through the wall and arrived at a large city in the northeast of the Bloom Divine Province, the Tiger Peace City.</p>

  <p>Having heard the news of Nine-Sun World Destruction, people began to leave and move out of the city. After all, if the Sun Crow race advanced further, they knew that the city would be their first stop.</p>

  <p>Everyone seemed helpless and defeated.</p>

  <p>With the masters killed in the North Unicorn Province and the destruction of the Oneness Sky Palace, it seemed like everything was just falling apart.</p>

  <p>Even if the people living in the Tiger Peace City retreated, where would they go?</p>

  <p>After everything that had happened, the Clear Lake and the seven mountains could not put a stop to the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>But just as everyone was about to surrender and let their guards down, a voice rang through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"They are back! Thank God they're still alive!"</p>
