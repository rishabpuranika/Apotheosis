<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The team was guided into a straight line as the warriors raced to escape.</p>

  <p>Though the Skyland warriors were being led by Kaydan and they were at the front of the column, it didn't mean that they were any safer than the others.</p>

  <p>There was an array of strict rules and regulations in the interior world, a single false step could spell unimaginable trouble.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race was in the middle of the group, while the Harmony race brought up the rear.</p>

  <p>Tilton, the leader of the Harmony race, stood in the back, controlling two Formless Sky Pythons as the beasts were being attacked by their own kind.</p>

  <p>The collision of the mountainous pythons against each other created a crashing sound that rippled through the sky and sent shock waves that made people a little unsteady on their feet. Their attack was so violent and powerful that any weaker creature caught in their path would have instantly been torn to pieces.</p>

  <p>Tilton's strategy was quite effective. The Formless Sky Pythons fighting among themselves in the back drastically slowed down their advancement towards the people.</p>

  <p>Naturally, this did not last forever as the ground at the back of the line suddenly caved in.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The earth cracked open with a thunderous rumble as an enormous Formless Sky Python clawed its way out from deep within the ground. It was not only able to creep close to the ground, but also able to move fluidly beneath it.</p>

  <p>Unable to dodge it fast enough, the Harmony warriors disappeared into the mouth of the animal. One would have assumed that the inner world of such a huge beast would rightly reflect the grandeur of the creature, but this one would be quite cruel. There was no chance of surviving once inside.</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Python, after devouring a few Harmony warriors, was still unsatisfied. In a flash, its body folded over itself in midair and dove towards the group.</p>

  <p>All Tilton could do was change his target yet again. He placed both his hands on his head and focused his energy on the Formless Sky Python charging towards them.</p>

  <p>But even when paired with the other six elite warriors of the Harmony race, he could only control two Formless Sky Pythons at a time. Once he managed to gain control over the one in front of him, one of the other two in the fight regained its faculties and began to pursue the group.</p>

  <p>The enormous beasts had the strength and size of moving mountains.</p>

  <p>Their overwhelming power made everyone tremble with crippling fear, and everyone's heart sank collectively.</p>

  <p>The interior world was a mirror world. Everything was a reflection of another world, but the air was unsettling.</p>

  <p>The plain they were standing on was the size of the cold flame field they had crossed, except that it was not covered in ice.</p>

  <p>With their speed, in such an open area, they would never be able to ditch the Formless Sky Pythons; they would only end up being crushed and devoured.</p>

  <p>"Run! Hurry up! They are catching up!"</p>

  <p>"How can we outrun them? They are too fast!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, I thought that I would be at least expanding my horizons, even if I didn't gain any fortune. I certainly did not expect to end up dying here today."</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors from the other races began to wail in grief. They had made great progress in the three sacred places. None of them had imagined that they would die here today. They were unready and unwilling to face this reality.</p>

  <p>Kaydan, who was leading the way, had a sullen face.</p>

  <p>The interior world was dangerous at every turn, but it wasn't the first time that they had ventured into this place. The many clansmen who had died in the past had shared their knowledge and experiences with them, helping them to avoid some deadly traps.</p>

  <p>Kaydan had been here many times before, yet he had never been in a situation as dangerous as this.</p>

  <p>"It's our turn to bring up the rear!"</p>

  <p>Chapman's muffled voice thundered. The eyes of the warriors from the Dragon Hunt Squad revealed a sinister and imposing Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors were the most famous hunters in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. They always hunted strange beasts, and now the stage had flipped and they were being hunted by them.</p>

  <p>"There's no use, Chapman," said Kaydan. "You can't fight off that many Formless Sky Pythons." His eyes were fixed straight ahead, as if he were searching for something in the distance.</p>

  <p>"This is hopeless. It seems that we will never be able to escape this anyway," Chapman replied. "Then we should go back and fight. It's the only chance that we have for survival."</p>

  <p>Kaydan fell silent.</p>

  <p>He understood what Chapman was saying, but these creatures were incredibly fast; there was no possible way to outrun them. This was a losing situation, and Chapman's optimism for survival was even more unreliable. To fight more than a hundred Formless Sky Pythons was simply inviting death.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his eyes lit up, as he saw a black sphere slowly floating on one side of the field.</p>

  <p>It resembled a pure black star, completely absorbing all the light around it. Visually, it was absolutely mesmerizing. It did not reflect any light, giving the impression that there was nothing within the sphere.</p>

  <p>"This is it. Follow me!"</p>

  <p>Kaydan exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>The others did not understand, but since Kaydan knew this place better than anyone else, they followed without question and all turned around simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Han Clan had been shuffling in the middle of the group the entire time.</p>

  <p>Apart from keeping up closely with the group, they had nothing better to do.</p>

  <p>They also noticed the mysterious black ball.</p>

  <p>Everyone began to question the situation all at once.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Are we going to charge in like this?"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, stop asking. Kaydan has led us here. We should trust that he has a way to get rid of the Formless Sky Pythons," said Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>She looked depressed, and knew that all their present troubles were all her fault. Since she had left her family, she discovered that regardless of where she went to, these unintelligent creatures always chased after her, as if her scent lured them in. This was bizarre.</p>

  <p>And she couldn't figure it out herself.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, they had reached the black ball. Kaydan abruptly stopped right in front of it. "Inside is another special world. It is connected to the other eight balls in the interior world," he said in a firm and clear voice. "It will take some time to get it opened. I will do my best to get it done."</p>

  <p>Then with a clap of his hands, waves of cyan life vitality formed and gently spread across the air, condensing and forming a huge cyan jade seal that covered the ball.</p>

  <p>"Nine stars?" Luo Zheng asked, his gaze frozen. "Is this one of the Nine Divine Stars?"</p>

  <p>The Nine Divine Stars were essential in the construction of the universe.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe in which he resided held countless stars, the majority of which were just a backdrop. The Nine Divine Stars were embedded in the constellations that illuminated the sky.</p>

  <p>They had existed for an eternity, and were the brightest in the Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and Middle Sky Regions. During his travels in the Upper World, Luo Zheng did a superficial study of the stars, and did not delve too deeply into the nine stars.</p>

  <p>When a grand era ended, many stars began to fall out of the sky, and new ones slowly rose. These nine stars had never fallen before. They were the source of the Holy Being's strength.</p>

  <p>The situation in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was quite special.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had stuffed his strength source into the Collapsing Mountain race's Sacred Spring Mountain, leaving the nine stars completely unused.</p>

  <p>At the very least, this was what Luo Zheng assumed, However, what he couldn't figure out was why Holy Jay would destroy his own nine stars and move the strength source to the bottom of the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>"There's no time!"</p>

  <p>"The beasts are coming!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Amidst a cacophony of screams, three Formless Sky Pythons stretched and hurled themselves down from the sky. They instantly burrowed and disappeared into the ground, leaving behind three massive pits. Along with them, about thirty to forty warriors also disappeared under the caved-in ground.</p>

  <p>It happened so suddenly that most did not even have the opportunity to scream or react before being swallowed completely.</p>

  <p>It would take some time to activate the black ball. When Kaydan's jade seal was imprinted on the ball, jade-green pattern continuously spread out along the black ball, but at the moment, even more Formless Sky Pythons were rushing over. It was too late …</p>
