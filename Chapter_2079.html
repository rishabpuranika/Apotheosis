<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Saul's conversation with those people, Luo Zheng could guess what they were thinking.</p>

  <p>These people wanted to leave the place as soon as possible and this was the only chip Luo Zheng could use to bargain with them.</p>

  <p>"I will let you go," Luo Zheng chimed in.</p>

  <p>The long-haired man's eyes flashed with a fiery light and the corners of his eyes twitched intensely when he heard Zheng's announcement.</p>

  <p>Though he began bubbling with excitement, he tried his best to restrain his emotions.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Several fierce auras exploded instantly from the prison's entrance� they were filled with anticipation.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I can teach you the Heinously Evil Way personally!"</p>

  <p>"Hmph! I can help you cultivate the Heaven Devouring Technique� it's much better than that Heinously Evil Way!"</p>

  <p>"Hey, Big Mouth� what do you mean? How about we fight it out right now?"</p>

  <p>"Haha! Master Evil� you weren't my opponent all those years ago.</p>

  <p>Even if we were anywhere else, you still wouldn't be my match!"</p>

  <p>Just like that, the two figures in the dungeon got into a heated argument as if they were fighting over a high position.</p>

  <p>During the long debate, they left Luo Zheng on the sideline. After a long moment, Luo Zheng finally interrupted. "I have only one request for you all to be released."</p>

  <p>This time, everyone kept silent.</p>

  <p>Mulling it over for a moment, he then spoke, "Help me kill three True Gods."</p>

  <p>Amidst the silence, the old voice resounded once again. "The difference in strength between True Gods can be huge. What's their level, low-rank, mid-rank, or top-rank? Perhaps the consummate level?"</p>

  <p>"Three low-rank True Gods," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Three mere low-rank True Gods� it's a piece of cake. What are their names?" The old voice inquired further.</p>

  <p>"Pranav Mu, Marko Mu, and Mateo Mu."</p>

  <p>"Three unknown juniors. Tsk, what an easy mission."</p>

  <p>Because these people had been imprisoned for many years, they didn't recognize any of the new True Gods within the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Wait, their last name is Mu?" one of them asked. "Are these three related to Murphy Mu?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng nodded in response.</p>

  <p>That made the long-haired man at the entrance frown as he said, "These three are all disciples of Murphy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng nodded another time.</p>

  <p>And again, there was only silence for a moment.</p>

  <p>These people in the dungeon were the most vicious types of True Gods in the divine land. They were extremely powerful, but that wasn't to say that they didn't care about anything.</p>

  <p>Back then, it was because they offended Bromley that they were taken into this dungeon. They had spent countless years in this dark dungeon, leading up to how much they now truly wanted to leave and never turn back.</p>

  <p>And Bromley was already considered to be one of the more merciful Holy Beings. Others wouldn't have even bothered imprisoning them and instead would have killed them on the spot.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng asked them to deal with three of Murphy's direct disciples, they knew it meant falling victim to Murphy's revenge. Even if they returned to the divine land, the Hall of Holy Beings would probably hunt them down� no one dared to offend Murphy.</p>

  <p>"You must change your request, young man. Whatever else it is, I will grant you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you can cultivate my Heinously Evil Way and become my disciple� I'll definitely make you famous in the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Humph. The Heaven Devouring Technique is still clearly the first choice."</p>

  <p>"My Heinously Evil Way is..."</p>

  <p>The two were rather serious about the idea of accepting a disciple.</p>

  <p>From their perspectives, even though Luo Zheng controlled Bromley's fairy palace, he was still merely a world lord. With their strength, they were capable of adopting Luo Zheng as a disciple.</p>

  <p>When he sensed the fighting began to escalate again, Zheng's eyes flashed fiercely as he shouted," Stop arguing!"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had control over these people's freedom, they didn't look up to Luo Zheng in the least. Hearing him yell stunned everyone silent for a bit.</p>

  <p>"Holy Bromley is my master. Do you all really believe that your strength is greater than his?" Luo Zheng asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"Holy Bromley?! He's accepting disciples again?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't he say he was done with that?"</p>

  <p>"Who on earth are you? Why are you able to become Bromley's disciple?"</p>

  <p>While they all feared Bromley to some extent, they also admired him deeply. Never did they think that Luo Zheng would be accepted as his disciple� it was a great honor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng never wanted to use the identity of Bromley's disciple in order to suppress them, but it was useless to use politeness with these kinds of people. Now that his identity was exposed, it could be considered a mere form of demonstration.</p>

  <p>"I already said, help me kill those three True Gods and I will immediately release you. There's no need to talk about the other conditions, and I don't need anything from you," Luo Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>A while later, the aged voice was heard, "If that's the case, then I'll do it."</p>

  <p>Although Murphy wasn't someone to be trifled with, a way out was still better than being imprisoned there for all eternity. Their limitless lifespans would subject them to boredom for a very long time� something most considered worse than death.</p>

  <p>But even though they agreed to the deal, it was difficult for Luo Zheng to guess what they were really thinking. Once they were released, Luo Zheng was probably going to lose control of them.</p>

  <p>"Before I release you, you may take an oath by your inner demon that you will heed my commands for the rest of your life. But if you ever disobey my order, you will be devoured by your inner demon to death,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said sternly.</p>

  <p>The long-haired man frowned at the statement, and another series of unsatisfied murmurs filled the dungeon once again.</p>

  <p>The restraints of the inner demon varied with the level of cultivation.</p>

  <p>While many low-level martial artists swore by the inner demon, it had no restraining on them. But after cultivating to the Life and Death Realm, the influence of the inner demon on the martial artist grew greater. The Wishing Spell was also a kind of inner demon oath.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you asking too much?" asked a faint voice from the dungeon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea how many people were being held in there but he was certain that he hadn't heard that voice before.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we can swear to our inner demons that we will kill Mateo, Marko, and Pranav, but we won't swear to obey you at all times." The old voice added their condition.</p>

  <p>Listening to Luo Zheng for the rest of their lives gave him full control over them. These people were well-known figures in the divine land� how could they be willing to restrict themselves as such? To a young man who was less than a hundred years old!</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered slightly as he said, "There's no other way. Since we can't reach an agreement, there's no need to continue."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Luo Zheng turned around and walked away.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of his own bargaining power� these people hardly had any choice but to adhere to his conditions.</p>

  <p>If these fellows were unwilling to swear the inner demon oath, even if they killed Marko, Mateo, and Pranav, they might cause trouble to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Watching Luo Zheng retreat, the long-haired man suddenly stood up and said,</p>

  <p>"I, Blayd Zhan, swear an inner demon oath that I will obey your commands for the rest of my life. If I should violate any one of them, I shall be devoured by the inner demon and die."</p>

  <p>When the man spoke, Zheng's steps came to a halt. He then turned around and smiled at the man, saying, "I'll see you free."</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng walked towards the entrance and activated the token of heaven in his hand. Immediately, a faint gray light shot out from it.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The moment the gray light touched the Fairy Chain, it cracked open layer by layer and disappeared from Blayd's hands.</p>

  <p>"Sir, since you have sworn an inner demon oath, you may come with me," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>When the chain broke, the long-haired man suddenly stretched out his muscles before rushing out. Then, he ran wildly across the backyard as a crazed expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"Haha! I'm finally free! I've been locked up for too long! I'm finally free!" The elated Blayd's face was full of excitement. As he ran, his bones crackled and he was brimming with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>When the old guys below the dungeon heard the commotion, they couldn't help but feel envious. Though they didn't want to give up the opportunity, they didn't want to make such a serious inner demon oath either.</p>
