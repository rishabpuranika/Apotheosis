<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Christopher's original plan was to stop and try to understand the law in the obelisk before climbing up, but the space repulsion was becoming stronger and stronger. If he continued to climb in this way, he would be pulled down by the repulsion in no time.</p>

  <p>But then he saw Luo Zheng climbing. Christopher had always been proud of the talent he was born with and considered himself superior in that regard.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng climbing while he was stuck in this dilemma made his blood boil. He could not let this happen!</p>

  <p>The very thought of defeat was unacceptable to him, especially against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was only short of eighty or ninety feet from the top of the obelisk.</p>

  <p>Both of them climbed with fast pace.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that Christopher was desperate and anxious while Luo Zheng was relaxed and composed. After understanding the Space Law in the first half of the obelisk, he had figured how to suppress the pull of the space repulsion, which then became much softer than before.</p>

  <p>As a result, he was able to climb much quicker and without any opposing forces affecting him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Christopher's situation was bad. Before they began the climb, he was under the impression that his understanding of the Space Law was much better than Zheng's. At the near end of the obelisk, he had almost reached the limit of resistance. He couldn't stop to comprehend the Space Law under such a critical situation.</p>

  <p>He had no strength to go on but he didn't stop. Defeat was not an option!</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth to summon up the courage and power to resist the space repulsion and hurled himself higher. But the higher he climbed, the stronger the repulsion became. Each movement was harder than the one before.</p>

  <p>While their souls climbed the obelisk, their bodies sat still on the ground.</p>

  <p>Christopher's body had turned red and was constantly shaking, while Zheng's body sat in peace, just like his soul. He behaved calmly and his breath was steady.</p>

  <p>At last, the climb came to a halt. The two seemed to have reached the final part at the same time, which was only thirty feet below the top.</p>

  <p>Both of them couldn't go ahead from this point. There was an invisible barrier blocking their path. It was the space barrier.</p>

  <p>"Seems like we have to stop," Luo Zheng said, blinking aggressively. He still needed some time to comprehend the Space Law to break through the barrier before them. But that wasn't a big problem as he already had some knowledge of it. Even at this height, the space repulsion didn't exert a lot of impact on him.</p>

  <p>Next to him, Christopher stood passively. His situation wasn't so good.</p>

  <p>He had been relying on the solid force of his soul to keep going further with a lot of difficulty, hoping to reach the top without any stops. In the face of this sudden barrier, he was caught off guard. His senseless rush had to be brought to a stop.</p>

  <p>The flimsy space barrier lay like a natural pit across him. With the strength that remained, it was impossible for him to force his way through.</p>

  <p>He couldn't meditate the Space Law under the strong space repulsion.</p>

  <p>He saw Luo Zheng adapting to the new surroundings effortlessly. Right then, Luo Zheng cast a glance at Christopher, shaking head slightly, and then continued to ponder over the Space Law, with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The smile made Christopher lose his mind!</p>

  <p>Under the obelisk, Elder Wei stood with a happy smile on his face. "This boy does not even have a strong bloodline, yet his skills and depth of understanding are amazing! It seems like we are harboring another elite disciple in the Dragon Abyss Palace!"</p>

  <p>Elder Wei belonged to one of the Dragon Lineage Human forces called Dragon Abyss Palace.</p>

  <p>Zack Zhao belonged to another force of Dragon Lineage Human called Dragon Blaze Hall.</p>

  <p>Elder Wei clapped with joy. On the contrary, Zack stood annoyed and unhappy, stomping his feet with nervousness. He could also see the current status on the obelisk. At the first phase of climbing, Christopher's speed was really fast. But that had nothing to do with the power of his understanding. It was mostly driven by the experience he had attained in the Lower World. He had already comprehended much of the Space Law there, which should help him fight with the space impulsion from the obelisk.</p>

  <p>If he could behave sedately and gradually understand the Space Law on the highest phase, he wouldn't have a lot of difficulty climbing to the top.</p>

  <p>But he wasn't focusing on winning, but rather on competing with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zack was concerned about his behavior, knowing that his situation was awkward. Christopher needed to understand the Space Law in order to go further with such a strong space impulsion against him. Zack wished he hadn't decided to use his remaining solid power of his soul to go further, as it was almost completely exhausted. Only a silly and foolish disciple would do that.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter what the Elders were thinking at the base of the obelisk.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng especially didn't care about what other people expected and thought of him. He calmed himself down and concentrated all his mind to feel the lines of the Space Law that spread across the obelisk.</p>

  <p>To climb to the top of the obelisk, one option was to directly break through the space barrier by force. Luo Zheng considered that option too, but it was obviously impossible for him to do that. The space barrier was created by complying with certain rules of the Space Law. He only needed to figure out what the rule was and then he would be able to pass through the barrier.</p>

  <p>Besides mentally trying to comprehend the rule, Luo Zheng also tried to touch the barrier with his soul. As he had assumed, the inner side of the barrier was a space independent in itself.</p>

  <p>He wondered if he would be able to travel freely if he fully understood the Space Law of this layer. As he thought deeper and deeper about it, he got really excited.</p>

  <p>The Space law was one of the most powerful laws among the Original Laws. It was said, if time was a king, then space was the ruler, which best described the power of these two Original Laws.</p>

  <p>There were many geniuses in the vast Central Region who could comprehend the Original Laws, and even more who could understand the conceptions that were derived out of them. However, there weren't many warriors who had made great achievements in the understanding of the Space Law and the Time Law.</p>

  <p>For example, Morphens' Mystical Pace was the basic implementation of the Space Law. The core logic was to first shake the space by sudden and enormous force, thus making the space unsteady, which would then generate black lines like those that had appeared on the Cloud Road during the trials. The black lines were a symptom of space collapse.</p>

  <p>Morphens could use these black lines to move around, hiding his body movement in the space, keeping him from being sensed by his opponents. The method he used was called Mystical Pace, which meant a pace which was so agile that it could confuse anyone. This was the fundamental use of the first level Space Law.</p>

  <p>Such an implementation wasn't really of a very high level. Luo Zheng could easily make use of it. He had tried this many times in Cloud Road. But he didn't have the terrific power that Morphens owned to force the space into unsteadiness and create the black lines.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng understood the Space Law in the obelisk completely, he wouldn't need any force to cross the barrier and could travel for the short distance in the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't contain his excitement at the thought!</p>

  <p>The only question remaining now was how he could pass through the transparent space barrier, using what he had understood about the Space Law.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng gradually absorbed himself in the Space Law, Christopher finally understood that if he kept competing with Luo Zheng this way, he would be shot out of obelisk in no time, which would bring no benefits, obviously, and also hurt his soul.</p>

  <p>Injuries on the soul did not impact him greatly as he had confidence in recovery. But his most outstanding characteristic was not the mastery of the Space Law, but the capacity of his soul. Even though he could obtain various panaceas to heal his soul from the great powers he was born into, he did not want to challenge himself at the expense of his health.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it would be humiliated for him to fall from the obelisk in front of so many refiners.</p>

  <p>Having struggled both physically and mentally, Christopher finally decided to give up and started to step down from the obelisk to where the space impulsion was within his ability. 'I must learn the Space Law step by step to improve. I have never figured Luo Zheng would be good at the understanding of the Space Law, but that's okay... I shall have many opportunities to defeat him in the future, ' Christopher thought, consoling himself, as he stepped down.</p>

  <p>While this was happening, Luo Zheng was completely immersed in the comprehension of the Space Law. He stared at the lines of the obelisk and was completely unaware that Christopher had left.</p>

  <p>As he gazed at the lines with utter concentration, his memory of the Space Law reflected in his mind, like two rivers meeting in an estuary, like a jigsaw puzzle coming to fruition. As these pieces were combined to make a full picture, the key point of the Space Law suddenly hit him.</p>

  <p>He squinted his eyes at the space barrier again, this time with a confident smile on his face.</p>

  <p>'Space barrier! I can break it!'</p>

  <p>He reminded himself. With this new-found confidence, he stopped clinging to the obelisk and let his hands go. His body lifted up in the air and he started to pass through the barrier with a sudden rush.</p>

  <p>This space barrier could not have been broken by any physical force or through the soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng's intention was never to break the barrier, but to pass through it. And that was what he was doing now... His soul was like a fish swimming in the water effortlessly. He floated through the barrier with grace and finally reached the top.</p>

  <p>Looking at Luo Zheng at the summit, Elder Wei smiled with immense glee and said with a tone of surprise,"In less than six hours of time, he has transformed from being completely unaware of the Space Law to having full understanding of the first level of it! I think the word elite is not enough to describe his talent!"</p>

  <p>He looked all around him and burst into a happy laughter.</p>

  <p>'Less than six hours?' Zack thought with shock. His heart was frightened to hear that. The obelisk was engraved with the existing Space Law to save refiners from exploring it bit by bit everywhere, but it didn't mean that the time could be shortened to as short as only six hours. At least, Zack had never heard of such a miracle. 'In that case, this young man really is genius! A genius of geniuses! From which Lower Word did this man come from?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>The two elders, Zack and Wei didn't get much time to think or discuss anything, because all the law obelisks around them suddenly started to tremble, producing a great sound and ultimately, a chaos among the viewers.</p>

  <p>The obelisks shook as if there was an earthquake, but that was impossible!</p>

  <p>Confused, Elder Wei looked up. He saw flashes of Law Power shooting at Luo Zheng, all converged together.</p>

  <p>"What is this? Is this the baptism by laws?" His eyes glistened with wonder, enchantment and total surprise.</p>
