</p>

  <p>The bronze statues on the four pillars silently watched all of this.</p>

  <p>Their eyes shifted, as if they were looking at a dead person.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was by no means something that ordinary people could touch. The bronze statues were sure that Zheng was courting death.</p>

  <p>The word 'ancestry' was very easy to understand. The mass of blood in the sacred cup was ancestral to all bloodlines.</p>

  <p>Only the strongest were qualified enough to tame the ancestry-level bloodline and find their own path that suited them.</p>

  <p>That was why the abilities that the ancestry-level bloodline could display weren't fixed. Everyone who successfully fused with the ancestry-level bloodline would obtain a unique power.</p>

  <p>They stood together at the source of all bloodlines, and then chose a direction and opened up a path.</p>

  <p>Four of the directions were widely known. These were the four origin-level bloodlines in the lower layer. These bloodlines had been born from the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A huge circle appeared around the cup and short light columns emerged from within, creating a symmetrical map.</p>

  <p>A grand ceremony was held when a warrior began fusing with the ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>Here, the strongest warriors in all the worlds would prostrate themselves around the square and become devout believers.</p>

  <p>This revelry was sometimes like a ceremony to be held before executions.</p>

  <p>And since most creatures entering the sacred cup couldn't escape death, what followed the ceremony was usually death rather than success.</p>

  <p>"The map has appeared."</p>

  <p>The bronze human was looking at the circle of light outside the cup.</p>

  <p>When the people in the cup began to merge with the bloodline, light columns would rise from the bottom of the cup. There were a total of three hundred and seventy-three light columns, and each of them represented a possible ability of the ancestry-level bloodline. This was the bloodline map.</p>

  <p>The bloodline map formed by the three hundred and seventy-three light columns had a number of changes, extending to the infinite. This meant that the ancestry-level bloodline had an infinite number of abilities. Even the bronze statues hadn't completely understood the bloodline map. They had roughly classified the abilities of the bloodline into four categories.</p>

  <p>If there were more light columns on the upper left, it meant that the ability of the fused ancestry-level bloodline would be more about creation. If there were more light columns on the upper right side, it would be about space and time. If there were more light columns on the lower left side, it would be more about life, and if there were more light pillars on the lower right side, it would be about destruction.</p>

  <p>With so many different light columns extending from the bottom of the cup, there would be a combination that could not be classified into any of the four categories. This classification could only be used as a reference.</p>

  <p>"All the light columns begin to extend, but they will soon stop," the bronze monkey said disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Even if a pig were to be thrown into the cup, all the light columns at the bottom of the cup would rise a few feet once the ancestry-level bloodline got into the pig.</p>

  <p>These light columns represented the potential of the creatures in the cup.</p>

  <p>When their potential was exhausted, their lives would come to an end.</p>

  <p>They could escape death only if there was at least one light column connected to the surrounding circle of light before the potential was exhausted. It would then mean that the person in the cup was qualified to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"They stopped?" The bronze snake said, his attention fixed on the movements of the light columns at all times.</p>

  <p>The sacred cup was at their center when the surrounding light columns came to a stop.</p>

  <p>The originally crimson human shape began to slowly melt in the sacred cup, turning back into thick blood and sinking into the cup.</p>

  <p>"He is dead. He was devoured by the ancestry-level bloodline, unable to bear its pressure," the bronze monkey sneered.</p>

  <p>The bronze human remained silent.</p>

  <p>He was, in fact, hopeful. This person had been able to break into this place, seemingly without reason. Was it just a coincidence? Was he really failing?</p>

  <p>'What am I thinking about?</p>

  <p>It is only normal that he fails to merge with the ancestry-level bloodline, isn't it?' the bronze human thought and shook his head.</p>

  <p>If the monkey wasn't so hot-tempered, he would have talked more with this person. At least he would have known where he came from.</p>

  <p>"The light columns haven't disappeared," the bronze snake said suddenly.</p>

  <p>The four statues were puzzled. If he really died, the map would disappear, and everything would return to its original state.</p>

  <p>Was there something wrong with the cup because it hadn't been used for a long time?</p>

  <p>They watched in confusion as two of the light columns began to rapidly expand.</p>

  <p>These two light columns were located on the lower left side. Light columns in this area usually meant that the ancestry-level bloodline possessed the life attribute.</p>

  <p>"He is dead. But why are the light columns still growing?" the bronze bird asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Something must be wrong," the bronze monkey sighed.</p>

  <p>There was indeed something wrong with the bronze square, the sacred cup, and the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Would it be their turn next?</p>

  <p>This place was called the Eternal Divine Courtyard, but there was no real eternity or immortality in this world.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop...</p>

  <p>The thick bloodline in the cup suddenly turned into something very strange.</p>

  <p>A figure slowly emerged from the cup not long after.</p>

  <p>"Blood Merge Reconstruction?" the bronze human exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>The other three bronze statues were equally shocked.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had unlimited possibilities.</p>

  <p>Once, someone had entered the ancestry-level bloodline and turned into a golden statue. Also, once someone had touched the ancestry-level bloodline and disappeared into a wisp of cyan smoke.</p>

  <p>There were simply too many combinations among the three hundred and seventy-three special attributes. No one could predict what would finally happen.</p>

  <p>The Blood Merge Reconstruction was extremely rare.</p>

  <p>When the ancestry-level bloodline had invaded Zheng from within, a sharp pain shot through every part of his body. He felt like his body was boiling.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was special. It could merge with almost anything, ranging from skin, to bones, internal organs, blood, and even souls.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't even move, let alone get rid of it. He could only watch as his entire body was devoured by the ancestry-level bloodline. It was not long before he sank into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Zheng originally had two kinds of bloodline power within his body. They now began to merge with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The first kind of bloodline power he had had was from Chiyou, which was a kind of source-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The second kind of blood power was from a Chaos Ancient God. The six great bloodlines of the Chaos Ancient Gods were not at the source level, but were directly derived from the truth in the chaos. However, they were on par with the bloodlines at the root level. This was why there was one long and one short light columns with the life attribute extending from the bottom of the sacred cup.</p>

  <p>In this absolute darkness, Zheng watched as specks of light appeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>Zheng had lost his vision, and his five senses were numb. He didn't know what form of existence he was now.</p>

  <p>But when he noticed these dots of light, he had a faint feeling that they were related to each other and formed the image of a mountain.</p>

  <p>He wanted to reach out, but couldn't. He wanted to sense what they were, but there was no way he could use his senses.</p>

  <p>What were they showing him?</p>

  <p>The mystery of the Abstruse Energy World? Or was this some kind of a special test?</p>

  <p>In the Abstruse Energy World...</p>

  <p>Some light dots floated, the result of the combination showing that a creature was moving.</p>

  <p>This creature was none other than Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>There was a rope around Geoffrey's waist, and behind him was Ziya, who held the other end of the rope.</p>

  <p>It looked like Geoffrey was dragging a blind person forward.</p>

  <p>Once they had entered the Abstruse Energy World, Geoffrey was unable to communicate with Ziya.</p>

  <p>This was not Geoffrey's fault, because Ziya could neither hear the voice nor speak.</p>

  <p>In his last exploration, Geoffrey had already crossed the grassland and seen a mountain which was beyond description. He climbed up the mountain out of curiosity and surprisingly found a window, similar to the one that Ziya had broken through from within the chaos.</p>
