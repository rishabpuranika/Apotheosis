<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, even you haven't seen Eastern Emperor Taiyi all these years?!" Qiu Yinhe's jaw dropped in shock.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since the last time Eastern Emperor Taiyi emerged from his seclusion.</p>

  <p>It was common for mighty warriors to cultivate in seclusion for hundreds, or maybe even thousands, of years. However, with the delicate state of the world, they needed him now more than ever.</p>

  <p>The leaders of many great forces were busy making their preparations.</p>

  <p>However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had chosen to use this time to cultivate in seclusion, which some found strange.</p>

  <p>"If that is the case, how did you control the huge stone just now?" Qiu Yinhe asked once more.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge shrugged. She wasn't afraid to tell them the truth. "Well, when I was cultivating in my palace, my maid sent me a piece of paper. There were 63 words on that paper. It was the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent!"</p>

  <p>Everyone in the cave gasped.</p>

  <p>"The Truth Enlightenment!"</p>

  <p>"Really? Eastern Emperor Taiyi has made a breakthrough! He was able to decipher 63 words!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was never one to shy away from uncomfortable discussions.</p>

  <p>Surveying the surprised faces surrounding her, she asked bluntly, "Do you also want to cultivate the Truth Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe, Goran and other two saluted immediately, but said, "We dare not."</p>

  <p>The Truth Enlightenment was the fruit of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's painstaking efforts, and they were all his subordinates. Without his permission, even if Feng Ge gave them the Truth Enlightenment, they did not dare to try learning it.</p>

  <p>"Alright. So what exactly is the point of me staying here? If you truly want to learn the Truth Enlightenment, just go to my father," Feng Ge said, a tinge of annoyance in her tone. She was always difficult to speak with.</p>

  <p>With her blunt words hanging in the air, a silence fell over the people as they shuffled around in embarrassment. They had been well-known masters in the Taiyi Heaven Palace for a while now, and yet this young girl was accusing them of coveting the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng couldn't stand her arrogance. "These masters just wanted to know how you controlled the huge stone. What makes you think they want to practice the Truth Enlightenment? You are insulting them! You're being too arrogant."</p>

  <p>Since Feng Ge was being rudely straightforward, Luo Zheng lashed her mercilessly with harsh words.</p>

  <p>"Humph," Feng Ge huffed indignantly. "The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent is a power releasing token, and the Truth Enlightenment can make up for all its shortcomings. If you can comprehend all of the Truth Enlightenment, you can reach a whole new level of cultivation. The Truth Enlightenment is a supreme technique, and no one can deny that!"</p>

  <p>The elders in the Taiyi Heaven Palace had always been polite to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>None of her peers dared to embarrass her. And yet, Luo Zheng was scolding her, in front of a crowd! There was no way she would be willing to take it meekly.</p>

  <p>The power releasing token Feng Ge referenced was the principle of each Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>While the Truth of Divine Dao itself did not contain any energy, it was the most practical technique used to maximize the power of one's Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The various theurgies that were created according to the Truths of Divine Dao were more like complements of power releasing.</p>

  <p>The Truth Enlightenment was the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, so its value was immeasurable. Feng Ge, Qiu Yinhe, Goran and the others understood this, and so did Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng couldn't stand Feng Ge's pride. "You just got 63 words, and yet you act as though you have the most precious thing in the world. I hate to break it to you, but the most important thing to you is worthless to me."</p>

  <p>He then turned to Qiu Yinhe and asked, "Masters, do you have any ink, a brush, and a piece of paper?"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe, Goran and the other two warriors glanced at each other uneasily.</p>

  <p>To ease the tension, the old man who was responsible for distributing flags in the Dragon City suddenly laughed cheerfully. "Well, what do you know?</p>

  <p>I happen to have those!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, a roll of pure white rice paper materialized in front of Luo Zheng. At the same time, a vial of black ink and a brush flew to his hands.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge knitted her brows and snapped, "My father has taught you the Truth Enlightenment, hasn't he? How dare you show it to the others!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng snorted. Dipping his brush into the ink, he started painting words onto the paper. "When I had just entered the Taiyi Heaven Palace, I heard that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had deciphered the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent with his amazing talent. He established the Taiyi Heaven Palace, one of the orthodox forces of the human race. I truly admired him!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the brush continued to dance on the paper.</p>

  <p>Each stroke carefully formed intricate calligraphy on the white rice paper, each character drawn precisely.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge glared at the words Luo Zheng was writing, seething with rage. She was certain he had obtained the Truth Enlightenment from Eastern Emperor Taiyi. In her mind, she believed no one in the world, except her father, could decipher it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Truth Enlightenment Luo Zheng was writing on the paper must have been taught by Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself. How disrespectful of Luo Zheng to show it off!</p>

  <p>Since the elders seemed to approve of Luo Zheng's actions, she couldn't try to stop him. Her rage festered silently from within.</p>

  <p>Originally, Qiu Yinhe was going to stop Luo Zheng. If Luo Zheng had really learned the Truth Enlightenment from Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he would have to take responsibility for showing it to others. Even the witnesses, such as Qiu Yinhe and the others, would be punished gravely.</p>

  <p>However, upon further reflection, Qiu Yinhe had traced Luo Zheng's movements ever since the latter had entered the Taiyi Heaven Palace. It was impossible for Luo Zheng to have come into contact with Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Besides, Luo Zheng had rented the yellow paper!</p>

  <p>Bearing this in mind, Qiu Yinhe figured that Luo Zheng must have deciphered it by himself. How incredible!</p>

  <p>The four elders present read the words silently as Luo Zheng continued writing.</p>

  <p>Their souls were much stronger than Luo Zheng's and Feng Ge's. They also encountered the incomparably sharp sword radiances while they were reciting. However, before the sword radiances could break out, they were forcefully wiped out in the depths of their souls.</p>

  <p>The four elders were all surprised. A mere dozen words could cause such sharp sword radiances. It was worthy to be the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stopped after writing a hundred words at one breath. Then he glanced at Feng Ge and shook his head. "It's a pity that the descendant of Eastern Emperor Taiyi is not as selfless as him."</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's last sentence was the last straw. Gritting her teeth, she was extremely annoyed.</p>

  <p>However, even she was curious about the Truth Enlightenment that Luo Zheng had written.</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened as she glanced at his writing. He had gone way beyond the 63 words she possessed. No wonder he had performed so well in the game.</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Zheng retorted. "The reason why Eastern Emperor Taiyi put the yellow paper in the Truth Library is that he wants the people in the world to decipher the last two Sanskrit words. Do you really think that only Eastern Emperor Taiyi is capable of deciphering the two Sanskrit words in this world?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's mouth hung agape but no words were uttered. Luo Zheng left her speechless.</p>

  <p>Unable to contain her fury, she suddenly darted forward and yanked the white rice paper from Luo Zheng's hands. With a haughty glare aimed at him, she tore the paper to shreds, and then abruptly turned to leave.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe and the others didn't even try to stop her.</p>

  <p>The elders had silently internalized all the words Luo Zheng had written down. It didn't matter that the paper was torn into pieces.</p>

  <p>Watching Feng Ge's receding figure, Qiu Yinhe let out a hearty laugh. "Luo Zheng, you've spent most of your time practicing after you joined the Heart Flow Sect; you are indeed strong-willed. However, you can't just openly offend Princess Feng Ge. After all, she's Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Eastern Emperor Taiyi is an understanding man! Plus, she isn't the only daughter he has, so he won't mind." Goran waved his hand nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>There was a twinkle in his eyes. He was not only comforting Luo Zheng, but also reassuring him he had his support. The Taiyi Governor's status in the Taiyi Heaven Palace was far greater than that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's children. It didn't really matter that Luo Zheng had offended one of them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, I wonder how you have deciphered those Sanskrit words. Are there more words that you've deciphered?" Qiu Yinhe asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not surprised to hear the question from Qiu Yinhe. He had already prepared for it. The Truth Enlightenment was so important to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, that it was impossible for him to present all the words his son had deciphered in one go. Today, he was willing to offer the one hundred words only because he wanted to see their reactions.</p>
