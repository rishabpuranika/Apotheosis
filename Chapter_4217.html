<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's current state had the Snake Spirit King confused as well.</p>

  <p>His opponent had shifted from Zheng to this sword, and as the sword dragged Zheng to fight him, Zheng clearly had become a burden to the sword.</p>

  <p>This was good news for him as it meant that Zheng was totally unable to fight back.</p>

  <p>Even so, this irregular heavy sword was so sharp and fast that it was capable of keeping up with him and breaking his fierce attacks.</p>

  <p>After all this time, he still could not defeat it. The Snake Spirit King was now growing impatient.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's body turn black brought a grim expression to his face.</p>

  <p>If a single sword was so difficult to deal with, how much more troublesome would Zheng and the sword together be?</p>

  <p>With this in mind, he launched another onslaught of fierce attacks!</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand strikes were launched from his two black blades in a matter of only a few seconds!</p>

  <p>To everyone else, the Snake Spirit King did not exist, nor were the black blades or the irregular heavy sword visible. Even Zheng's hand clutching the sword could only be seen very faintly.</p>

  <p>The clanging of the black blades and the heavy sword rang over ten thousand times, louder and harsher than before. It sounded as if someone was grinding a sword on marble.</p>

  <p>"Clatter, clatter, clatter..."</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the warriors present were all at the Eternal Realm or above. If they had been any weaker, hearing such sounds would have probably driven them insane.</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword finally buckled under the immense pressure of the attacks and could no longer hold off all the Snake Spirit King's strikes.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>It failed to block one of the ten thousand slashes that came at Zheng and a black blade slammed ruthlessly into his heavy black armor.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A thin crack surfaced across the armor over Zheng's waist. It extended through the inner layer, allowing the blade to cut all the way through to his back!</p>

  <p>"Zheng was hit!"</p>

  <p>"That sword... can it not withstand the attacks anymore?"</p>

  <p>"Zheng seems to have fallen into some sort of trance and can't wake up..."</p>

  <p>"Waking up would be useless. He couldn't avoid the blade anyway!"</p>

  <p>Those on the alter discussed their thoughts with one another, with the human spirits of the Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House the most nervous among them.</p>

  <p>They had not expected a human to be the one to decide the final result. As human spirits, they did all they could, which was only to watch from the sideline.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Snake Spirit King slashed out ten thousand more strikes with the blades.</p>

  <p>Maintaining constant caution and defending non-stop was impossible and more like a death sentence than anything else. Inevitably, the irregular heavy sword missed two of the ten thousand strikes!</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng's right shoulder was struck and hurt.</p>

  <p>The wound was a foot and a half long, almost splitting Zheng's body in two.</p>

  <p>Any other Eternal Realm warrior would have been sliced by such a strike.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline had strengthened Zheng's body greatly and so he felt close to no pain.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline began moving.</p>

  <p>Green energy gushed out of the wound, madly repairing it as fast as it could.</p>

  <p>Such a great amount of life energy contained powerful repairing ability, enough to almost bring a dead person back to life. However, Zheng's body was so strong and sturdy that it would take a lot more than usual. This made his recovery speed much slower.</p>

  <p>Three seconds later...</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King launched another ten thousand strikes!</p>

  <p>The heavy irregular sword was able to resist nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight of them, letting two through.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>They struck Zheng square in the chest, breaking through the black armor, slicing his ribs and piercing into his heart.</p>

  <p>The next round of the assault unleashed ten thousand strikes once more.</p>

  <p>The hearts of everyone on the alter skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>"What should we do! What should we do? That sword can't hold off the Snake Spirit King's attacks!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng's going to be dismembered!"</p>

  <p>"If he keeps taking hits like this he will surely die!"</p>

  <p id="top_24">"Shall we help?" suggested Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Alphonse smiled bitterly and shook his head, "How could we help him?"</p>

  <p>They couldn't even see the Snake Spirit King...</p>

  <p>He was so fast, that to them Zheng was fighting an invisible foe.</p>

  <p>Who among them was capable of attacking an 'invisible' opponent?</p>

  <p>Manuel, Tearrag and other Monkey Masters had already rushed down while Hamilton was still stuck in thought.</p>

  <p>But before they could even step out of the altar, they were hit by hundreds of strikes. They were all cut into inch-thin pieces that floated in the wind.</p>

  <p>It was a spectacular scene to behold...</p>

  <p>The method and skill that were used to execute the attack were beyond their comprehension.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King still had most of his attention focused on Zheng when he had sliced the Monkey Masters. He had been distracted for a moment and could not break through the defense of the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Another ten thousand strikes then slashed out.</p>

  <p>Zheng's black armor was ripped to shreds and more and more horrific and fatal wounds appeared on his body.</p>

  <p>Black energy covered his entire body as he was being stabbed over and over again.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's black blades sped up again.</p>

  <p>This time, however, he pushed his power to the limit, making his ten thousand strikes even trickier to handle.</p>

  <p>"Clatter, clatter, clatter..."</p>

  <p>Amongst the high pitched clattering of metal, the irregular heavy sword missed over a hundred strikes this time.</p>

  <p>If they were to connect with Zheng's body, it'd be enough to slice him to pieces.</p>

  <p>But before this could happen, Zheng opened his eyes and noticed a cloud. A trace of confusion ran through his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was a large black cloud with the radius of about twenty miles, covering the altar and an area in front of it.</p>

  <p>Zheng gained instant enlightenment when he looked at this cloud; he could appear anywhere within the range it covered.</p>

  <p>Whether it be the edge of the black cloud or the center of it, he could appear in multiple places at the same time!</p>

  <p>It was a truly wondrous feeling.</p>

  <p>There did not seem to be any concept of space and time within the cloud, or at the least, space and time behaved quite special.</p>

  <p>Although he could be in many places at once, it was not duplicates of himself; it was all him.</p>

  <p>He was capable of appearing and disappearing in several places all at once!</p>

  <p>Zheng then saw quite clearly the ten positions of the Snake Spirit King, and the over a hundred strikes coming from these spots were missed by the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>They approached at deceptive angles which made them difficult to escape and made every blow fatal.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng understood the Probability Extreme Form, he could move through the cloud as the Snake Spirit King could. Because of this, he suddenly vanished from everyone's view.</p>

  <p>His figure flashed backward continuously.</p>

  <p>There was only one of him, but he appeared more than ten times in different directions. With every dash and dodge, the Snake Spirit King's strikes were inches from connecting with him.</p>

  <p>Zheng managed to dodge all the black blades' strikes effortlessly!</p>

  <p>He then put some distance between himself and the Snake Spirit King. For the first time, they both stopped and their figures were clear for everyone to see.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body might have been covered in wounds and the ancestry-level bloodline was still working double time to repair it, but he still wore a smile on his face. "Did you make this cloud? It's really something. I seem to be able to wander within it freely."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's face darkened.</p>

  <p>The Probability Extreme Form had given him a huge advantage, but in such a short period of time, Zheng had mastered it. He had never in his wildest dreams expected that.</p>
