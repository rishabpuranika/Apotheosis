  <p>
</p>

  <p>After swallowing the red python, the huge ape closed its eyes.</p>

  <p>That was the last they saw of it as its face naturally blended into the darkness and disappeared.</p>

  <p>None of them knew what happened in the Dark Region. Was this huge ape perhaps reaching out its hand to them? Or was it actually preparing to smash them all into bits?</p>

  <p>Dorothy grabbed Luo Zheng's hand in fear while Feng Ge continued to look around nervously.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the giant, hairy hand appeared in front of them again! This time, it was curled up like a fist.</p>

  <p>Its sudden appearance stressed out everyone present. Some warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Nine Li race even trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself felt the domineering pressure that emanated from this giant fist.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, however, the giant fist did not slam down to smash their fragile souls. Instead, it slowly descended, like it was dragging something in its hold.</p>

  <p>They watched the fist unfurl and reveal to them a boy.</p>

  <p>He looked like any other eight-year-old human boy, save for one unique feature.</p>

  <p>A third eye, right in the middle of his forehead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but stare.</p>

  <p>The little boy was injured. Luo Zheng could see that both his shoulders were broken and the left side of his face was bleeding. However, he didn't seem to be in any pain.</p>

  <p>"I was fighting with those black monkeys when I found that I caught the fish. You're such a bummer!" the three-eyed boy whined, stomping his foot and shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Fish?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's and Chaim's hearts both trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>The light from the three huts had felt like a trap.</p>

  <p>It was just so convenient: a shining road, a stable-looking bridge, and three lit huts.</p>

  <p>There were times when clarity was only granted after experiencing a disaster. This situation right now seemed to be a fair example. None of them really knew anything about the Dark Region, after all.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me. What do you mean by fish?" Hutton asked, respectfully cupping his hands to the boy.</p>

  <p>A powerful ape was under this three-eyed boy's control which meant that he wasn't anyone that should be trifled with. Hutton knew he had to be careful of what he said.</p>

  <p>"I mean you guys," the three-eyed boy answered.</p>

  <p>He then suddenly sprang up from the huge palm and sniffed the air.</p>

  <p>"You're all weak."</p>

  <p>"Too weak..."</p>

  <p>The three-eyed boy meant what he said. These Souls of Light were terribly weak. Even the ants of the Dark Region were a hundred times stronger than them!</p>

  <p>As he sniffed, his eyes caught Luo Zheng and a strange expression flashed on his young face. "Huh? At least there's a body here. I don't know how you entered the Other Shore. But since you're here, just stay. The others can just go to hell."</p>

  <p>The way this three-eyed boy casually sentenced death upon these Souls of Light stumped everyone present.</p>

  <p>All of them took a step back, their breath surging from this threat.</p>

  <p>They knew there was no way they could defeat this formidable opponent but that didn't mean they were going to give up that easily. Hutton and his group once again showed the shadow with three heads and six arms, Feng Ge's soul burned with golden flames, and Dorothy's Necklace of Mystic Soul emanated power in waves.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Their joint attack was formidable.</p>

  <p>Nobody in Stage Thirteen would dare confront this attack head-on, save for Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>However, it was still too weak against this formidable opponent. Without even lifting a finger, the three-eyed boy summoned a ray of light out of his third eye, forming a green hoop that began to circle the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Then their theurgies that had stimulated the powerful force disappeared.</p>

  <p>As the group's attack was blocked, Luo Zheng took this chance to rush towards the boy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attempt made the boy sneer. He tilted his head as if inviting him to come closer.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was an arm's length away, the boy suddenly reached out and grabbed his right hand. With minimal movement, he flipped Luo Zheng over and smashed him onto the ground!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Previously invincible Luo Zheng found himself powerless against this three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>After tossing his assailant into the ground, the boy once again released a ray of green light from his third eye. "Puff, puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>This light pierced through all the warriors' chests, forming a gruesome string of souls.</p>

  <p>Pierced by this strange light, the warriors found themselves no longer in control of their souls and could only stare at the three-eyed boy in shock.</p>

  <p>Only Feng Ge's Soul of Light was left behind.</p>

  <p>"Your soul fire is useful, so you can stay," the boy told her. "The rest will go to hell now."</p>

  <p>However, before the boy could exterminate everyone, Luo Zheng found the strength to shout. "Stop!"</p>

  <p>The boy pouted, his eyes full of malice as he looked at Luo Zheng. "Do you actually think you're qualified to stop me?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he said that, the green light on his third eye flashed and a soul of the Nine Li race began to get sucked in.</p>

  <p>"Tod!"</p>

  <p>"Tod!"</p>

  <p>This grisly sight of their member dying caused great pain and sadness to Hutton, Sally, and the others. Unfortunately, they had no means to resist.</p>

  <p>"Since Feng Ge and I are fish, we must be useful to you! We'll do whatever you ask, just don't kill them!" Luo Zheng cried out, eager to negotiate with the boy.</p>

  <p>"To kill them or not to kill them, the choice is all mine to make, not yours.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, you will still have to serve me," the boy said with a shrug as another person's Soul of Light shrank and was sucked into the green light.</p>

  <p>"You kill one more person and Feng Ge and I will kill ourselves rather than serve you," Luo Zheng demanded, meeting eyes with Dorothy who stood not far away.</p>

  <p>Dorothy stared blankly at Luo Zheng. His words touched her heart.</p>

  <p>One more soul and it would be her turn to get sucked into the green light.</p>

  <p>Dorothy didn't really feel any fear in dying but she still appreciated his gesture. "Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't really want to give up her life but she couldn't refute Tianxing's words. Hearing what Dorothy called him though stunned her.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge repeated, staring at Tianxing with suspicion.</p>

  <p>The three-eyed boy did not care for these Souls of Light which was why he was making quick work of exterminating all of them. That elaborate trap he had set up took a lot of time along with waiting for actual victims to show up. Now that he managed to fish up Luo Zheng and Feng Ge, there was no way he was willing to let go of them. He had no way of knowing when the next group of creatures would break into the Grand Sky Temple and he might have to wait for another long while. Most importantly, Luo Zheng's body was extremely rare and valuable.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that the three-eyed boy finally hesitated.</p>
