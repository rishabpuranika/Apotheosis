<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1939 The Godly Way Guide </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When martial artists became world lords, boundaries were placed in their inner worlds. It was comparable to a country selecting a piece of land for itself.</p>

  <p>And when they reached the world lord realm, the boundary-forming power resonated with the vitality between heaven and earth to create the Boundary Cloud which contained a trace of the mysteries of world evolution and recorded a bit of the martial artists' comprehension of the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Martial artists also recognized the Boundary Cloud as a standard to measure a world lord's potential and strength.</p>

  <p>The ball of Boundary Cloud that Luo Zheng had drawn was shocking not just because of the color. It gave off a mysterious Mu Ning as it kept rolling and rolling. The patterns within it also seemed to contain some kind of mystery.</p>

  <p>All the martial artists had their eyes glued to the Boundary Cloud, none of them able to understand just what was happening.</p>

  <p>When Nathan became a world lord, the Boundary Cloud he released had a bit of rhombic patterns— the symbol of the Truth Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses who cultivated the Truth Godly Way could have some understanding of it if they observed this Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>And when Lucille was promoted to world lord, the Five Elements Annual Rings— patterns belonging to the Five Elements Godly Way— appeared within her Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>However, the patterns in Zheng's Boundary Cloud were not regular. They were constantly changing, as if all three thousand Godly Ways were being shuffled.</p>

  <p>High above in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Jay was also watching Zheng's Boundary Cloud with disbelief.</p>

  <p>The reason the living beings within the Valley of Time were attracted by the Boundary Cloud was because there was a mystery hidden within it that they couldn't decipher. And although they couldn't understand much, they still found it astounding...</p>

  <p>But Holy Jay was still a Holy Being. It was just that the universe he created was rather special.</p>

  <p>Before he became a Holy Being, he had seen something similar to this.</p>

  <p>"It's scarily similar to the Godly Way Guide..."</p>

  <p>This so-called Godly Way Guide wasn't actually a book but a ball of rolling brown mist that was very similar to the Boundary Cloud Luo Zheng had activated.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Boundary Cloud however, was still incomparable to the true Godly Way Guide as the Godly Way Guide's complexity was far beyond what ordinary people could imagine.</p>

  <p>After all, all three thousand Godly Ways in the divine land came from this Godly Way Guide.</p>

  <p>One glance at the Godly Way Guide was enough to incinerate the souls of ordinary creatures!</p>

  <p>And because the information contained in the Godly Way Guide was too vast, they wouldn't be able to resist the origin-related information that would flood their minds and when one's soul wasn't strong enough, that person could end up injured or worse, killed.</p>

  <p>Even True Gods were extremely cautious when facing the Godly Way Guide. If they weren't careful enough, their souls might be severely damaged. Even Holy Beings could only look at it when the chance presented itself which was once in a blue moon. Being able to look at the Godly Way Guide truly was a rare opportunity in the divine land, and Holy Jay, since he became a Holy Being, had only seen it once!</p>

  <p>And it was by the Godly Way Guide that he cultivated the Soul Suppressing Technique.</p>

  <p>In Holy Jay's eyes, Zheng's Boundary Cloud was already in its initial stage but the profound mystery within it was still very vague. As Zheng's cultivation base continued to increase, it would probably come closer and closer to perfection!</p>

  <p>'It seems like Bromley's assumption was right. If we let this guy continue to grow and cultivate, maybe he can really create a new divine land. I just hope Mike can hold on till that day...'</p>

  <p>This year, the Godly Geniuses were cultivating in seclusion and were unaware of the universe's situation. But as for Holy Jay, he remained well-informed of the happenings in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe Mike created was currently in a bad shape...</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses were still in the closed-door cultivation and Holy Jay couldn't tell Luo Zheng or Tianming the bad news. It would only add pressure to their shoulders and wouldn't bring them any good.</p>

  <p>The brown Boundary Cloud spread much slower than the other warriors', but it was extremely condensed and did not dissipate easily. It began to spread in all directions in a low but stable speed.</p>

  <p>It took only about three minutes for Nathan's Boundary Cloud to spread twenty miles before if dissipated.</p>

  <p>But now, an hour had passed and Zheng's Boundary Cloud had only expanded five miles. Its speed had also slowed down considerably. It seemed like the boundary-forming power was already beginning to weaken.</p>

  <p>"Only five miles?" Lone asked with a smack of his lips.</p>

  <p>He admired Luo Zheng a lot. It somehow disappointed him that his Boundary Cloud had spread over fifteen miles but Zheng's only spread five miles. The gap was just too big.</p>

  <p>"Humph! So what if it's only five miles? Can't you see what's inside Zheng's Boundary Cloud? I bet you can't make sense of it either!" Lucille retorted furiously.</p>

  <p>"You're one to talk. You're just pretending to understand it..."</p>

  <p>Lone responded indignantly. Lucille huffed at Lone's words.</p>

  <p>The spreading range of the Boundary Cloud depended on the boundary-forming power. The larger the great world of the warrior's body was, the greater the boundary-forming power was. So when others saw this scene, they immediately thought that Zheng's great world was relatively small.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was because his Boundary Cloud was compared to those of the other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>In fact, the ordinary world lord's Boundary Cloud only spanned three to five miles in average. It was just that this group of Godly Geniuses were all extraordinary and made Luo Zheng seem mediocre.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's Boundary Cloud spread to six miles, it was completely unable to move.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked on with surprise.</p>

  <p>Normally, after the Boundary Cloud stabilized, it would dissipate shortly after. However, after ceasing to spread, Zheng's Boundary Cloud continued to float in the sky.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was still sitting upright inside the cave in a meditative state.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the chaotic sea, the curtain of light was gradually stabilizing, enclosing the whole sea as well as the central continent within it.</p>

  <p>During this time, the ordinary martial artist's great world would have already been formed.</p>

  <p>The curtain of light continued to absorb the chaotic energy all the while, producing a tiny amount of boundary-forming power. It was this power that prevented the Boundary Cloud from dissipating, keeping it afloat above the Valley of Time.</p>

  <p>The light curtain needed a lot of chaotic energy, so the chaotic energy surged toward it from all directions. As the curtain continued to absorb energy, the coastline of the central continent also began to descend, even attracting the attention of the humans on it. Within Zheng's inner world, some of the human martial artists who were near the sea wondered why the water level of the chaotic sea dropped so fast.</p>

  <p>The Boundary Cloud floated in the air for six hours, while Luo Zheng had spent a hundred and twenty days in the cave.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face twitched slightly. The light curtain within his inner world suddenly began to emit rays of light, which was followed by an extremely strong boundary-forming power gushing out.</p>

  <p>"Has it completely formed?"</p>

  <p>After the rays of light disappeared, Luo Zheng began to observe the light curtain. His eyes gleamed with wonder and his mouth fell agape.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the boundary-forming power erupted outwards like a violent beast that was just released from its cage. It began to violently resonate with the vitality between heaven and earth at the peak of the Valley of Time!</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>The resonance caused a sharp cry to burst out.</p>

  <p>It was as if someone had suddenly thrown a large rock into the water, causing a huge ripple.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's Boundary Cloud, which was stagnant earlier, began to rapidly spread in all directions, its speed already beyond the Dragon Flyer race's understanding.</p>
