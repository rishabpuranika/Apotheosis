<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since he entered the Feather Holy Sea, Fredric had been facing conflicts with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The York Divine Kingdom already had an irreconcilable conflict with him. Both Marine and War Emperor York wanted to eliminate Luo Zheng as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>However, Fredric also knew that the difference between his strength and Zheng's own was too great, so he tried his best to endure these small conflicts. In Fredric's eyes, Luo Zheng would be easily killed by his father when he left the secret land.</p>

  <p>But Fredric was still the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom after all. Moreover, he was the most outstanding one of the four crown princes among the divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>There was a limit to his tolerance. He had already tried his best to tolerate Luo Zheng, but Luo Zheng was too arrogant. How could Fredric endure it?</p>

  <p>An indescribable rage rushed straight to his head.</p>

  <p>If it were anyone else, Fredric would have already launched an attack, even against someone like the little monster. However, thinking about Zheng's almost abnormal strength, Fredric gritted his teeth and held back the impulse to attack him. "What if I don't? What is it that you want?</p>

  <p>You want to fight me?"</p>

  <p>"No. I won't dare attack you, and there is no need to do so!" Luo Zheng smiled as a trace of indifference appeared in his eyes. At the same time, a formless soul pressure slowly exuded from him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. The soul pressure he emanated was enough to frighten the divine-level talents, including Fredric. Moreover, Zheng's soul had fused with the will of the world.</p>

  <p>Due to the rising conflict between the two of them, many warriors who had left the mine didn't return to the pyramid. Instead, they watched the fight from the sidelines.</p>

  <p>Most of them knew that even if there was a conflict between Fredric and Luo Zheng, it would be foolish of them to step in and take action.</p>

  <p>The reason for this was simple. Luo Zheng was able to survive the attack of War Emperor York unharmed. In other words, a Soul Sea Realm master couldn't do anything to Luo Zheng if he didn't activate his domain.</p>

  <p>Which meant also that no warrior below the Soul Sea Realm could harm Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He would not dare make a move against Fredric either. He had already offended the York Divine Kingdom to a great extent.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were to fight against Fredric here and injure or even kill him, War Emperor York would definitely not let him off the hook once he arrived at the Feather Emperor Secret Land to retrieve the Soul Core.</p>

  <p>Everyone was only here to watch the show.</p>

  <p>However, as Luo Zheng released his soul pressure, the expressions on the faces of the divine-level talents instantly changed.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning released by Zheng's soul was not inferior to that of a Soul Sea Realm master— in fact it was stronger than that of a mediocre one. No divine-level talent could withstand it.</p>

  <p>At the moment, they felt as if they were not facing a single person, but the world, the sea, or the mountains.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning was majestic and difficult to resist. Even war kings and war emperors had to bow before it.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, the divine-level talents behind Fredric had been clenching their teeth, trying to tolerate Zheng's Mu Ning. How could they accept the fact that they were being pushed back by the Mu Ning of a warrior who was only at the middle stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm?</p>

  <p>However, as Zheng's Mu Ning continued to increase, the divine-level talents couldn't endure it any longer. Their legs trembled, and at the same time, they could not help but retreat one by one.</p>

  <p>Fredric was the only one left standing on the spot, his eyes staring fixedly at Luo Zheng as he said through gritted teeth, "Tianxing Luo! Don't you dare go too far!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, Luo Zheng did not attack. He was only using his soul pressure to try and suppress Fredric. The problem was that with such powerful soul pressure, how different was this from outright fighting Fredric?</p>

  <p>In truth, Fredric wore a necklace called the Heart Condensation Necklace, which was a sacred weapon. The necklace could eliminate sixty percent of the opponent's soul attack. In other words, once Zheng's soul pressure released itself, it would get decreased by sixty percent.</p>

  <p>Protective weapons that were also sacred weapons were extremely rare to begin with. They far surpassed top-grade sacred weapons used for attacks. What was more, sacred weapons that could resist soul attack were even rarer. Thus, the Heart Condensation Necklace was worth as much as a semi-divine weapon.</p>

  <p>However, the necklace's design was more feminine. In the middle of the necklace was a purple gem called the Heart Condensation Gem, which played an extremely important role. Because this necklace was made for female warriors, Fredric always wore it inside so no one could detect it.</p>

  <p>It was because of this necklace that Fredric was struggling to hold on in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face revealed a trace of astonishment, but his lips immediately formed an even brighter smile. "Your soul is far from the Fighting Soul Realm, yet you are able to withstand my soul pressure. Interesting! Let's see how far you can go!"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, Luo Zheng lifted one foot and took a step toward Fredric.</p>

  <p>An almost unhealthy flush covered Fredric's face. However, in the blink of an eye, the flush disappeared and was replaced with a deathly pale color. Fredric clenched his teeth, stubbornly enduring the soul pressure.</p>

  <p>In truth, Zheng's strength was on par with that of a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>It was just that he hadn't experienced a life or death crisis, hadn't activated his soul sea, and didn't have his own domain.</p>

  <p>However, Fredric was unwilling to admit to this fact. He still regarded Luo Zheng as someone of the same level. He considered Luo Zheng to be only the most outstanding one in the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Because of it, Fredric refused to admit his defeat before Luo Zheng. If the person before him was not Luo Zheng but a Soul Sea Realm warrior, Fredric would have probably given in and bowed his head.</p>

  <p>One step...</p>

  <p>Two steps...</p>

  <p>Three steps...</p>

  <p>With every step that Luo Zheng took, the soul pressure on Fredric increased, his face turning impossibly paler.</p>

  <p>Six or seven steps later, Fredric's face was as pale as a sheet.</p>

  <p>"I...I'm going to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Fredric could not hold it in any longer. Suddenly, a short halberd materialized in his hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw this and the corners of his mouth curled up. "I have heard that although the Heavenly Thunder Halberd is a single-use consumable, it is a semi-divine weapon and that it is invaluable. Your father gave it to you so you could protect your life with it, correct?</p>

  <p>This short halberd at least costs 300, 000 to 400, 000 supreme life vitality crystals. I just want you to return 9, 000 supreme life vitality crystals to Callan, yet you refuse to do so. Are you foolish? Haven't you learned arithmetic before?</p>

  <p>I know you don't want to lose face, but even though you are the crown prince of a divine kingdom, you must learn how to perceive the situation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, a divine kingdom is of no real importance in this world. In the Upper World, it would be like a speck of dust. If you can understand this, you will understand what you must do."</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was cold, but his words contained an irresistible stateliness.</p>

  <p>Fiona's eyes lit up when she heard Zheng's words. On one hand, she was grateful that Luo Zheng had helped her and her brother out. On the other hand, his words awakened something in her.</p>

  <p>She had always been doted upon by her father, the emperor of Wind Divine Kingdom, which was why she was so innocent and elegant, even willful. But even though her father was the emperor of a divine kingdom, he was not bound to protect her forever. Her future could be very different. Perhaps she should reconsider her life goal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't care about the 9, 000 supreme life vitality crystals. He had already accumulated a massive amount of life vitality crystals just from selling the ores.</p>

  <p>Of course, Fredric didn't care about these 9, 000 supreme life vitality crystals either. If he really returned them, it would mean that he was afraid of Luo Zheng, and that was the last thing he wanted.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even though Zheng's words were well-founded, Fredric refused his suggestion. The life vitality in his hand suddenly flashed, purple lightning wrapping itself around the Heavenly Thunder Halberd.</p>

  <p>The runes on the Heavenly Thunder Halberd began gleaming continuously. Clearly, these were activated by Fredric.</p>

  <p>The martial artists gaped at the scene, their expressions changing instantly. Many of them had witnessed firsthand the power of the Heavenly Thunder Halberd before. In a mere instant, it had killed many ghosts. The Heavenly Thunder Halberd was comparable to a Soul Sea Realm warrior's attack.</p>

  <p>Many warriors retreated. Camilla, Fiona, Callan, and the others distanced themselves from Luo Zheng. Even if they didn't die, they could still be severely wounded by the power of the Heavenly Thunder Halberd.</p>

  <p>"Alas! What an idiot!" Luo Zheng sighed softly and took another step toward Fredric.</p>
