<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Glowing before the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other human heroes was the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>They attempted to trace it with their eyes. Its very existence was unusual to them. Its aura was truly unlike any other aura they had ever felt from the blended bloodlines.</p>

  <p>The blended bloodlines of the thirteen wolf teeth had thirteen different auras, each with their own special quality.</p>

  <p>For instance, the wolf tooth on the furthest right held the power of fire, from which its scorching aura truly radiated. Its aura was so strong that even if the tooth had been damaged, it still emitted heat. If one inched towards it, they would feel a burning sensation seep into their flesh.</p>

  <p>The third wolf tooth from the right radiated a completely different aura.</p>

  <p>Unlike the previous one, this one was soft and quiet, comfortable even. If one laid their hands upon it, tension would disappear completely from their bodies, being replaced with serenity.</p>

  <p>There were other auras in the thirteen wolf teeth. Some complemented each other; some opposed each other. Either way, with all of the auras' complexities, it was difficult to deny the teeth were extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The aura of the ancestry-level bloodline was also extraordinary but for a different reason.</p>

  <p>To Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions, it was obvious the ancestry-level bloodline's composition was unusual, but even so, they knew it was far from complex.</p>

  <p>It was the simplest thing. It was pure and perfect.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed, putting a hand over his chest.</p>

  <p>None of them knew how the Four Spirits Sect was able to obtain such an excellent object.</p>

  <p>Out of all of them there, it was Luo Zheng who knew how truly powerful the ancestry-level bloodline was. Because of this, it was him who knew how to appreciate it the most for all it was.</p>

  <p>However, he also knew that despite how powerful it was, it was nothing unless he was able to make use of it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the ancestry-level bloodline had a mind of its own. No one was able to control it. It made its own decisions.</p>

  <p>It could decide to help Luo Zheng, but it could also devour him completely.</p>

  <p>Despite this, Luo Zheng decided its power was worth the risk. After he made a cut on his arm, he spoke, "I do not know whose side you are on, but more than ever, I need you to hear me out. The Monkey Spirit King is in a deep slumber. Only the thirteen wolf teeth can wake him up! If you are against the Monkey Spirit King, then continue ignoring me! But if you are willing to help him, I beg you. Please restore the bloodlines of the wolf teeth!"</p>

  <p>He knew this was a desperate action, but he had to do it. Knowing no one was able to force the ancestry-level bloodline into doing any course of action, he called onto it directly, telling it the problem they were facing.</p>

  <p>This was the most he could do to persuade it into taking their side.</p>

  <p>A few of the human heroes looked at Luo Zheng with a mixture of wonder and pity on their faces.</p>

  <p>What he was doing was so out-of-character.</p>

  <p>For them, it was inconceivable to see Luo Zheng talk to his own bloodline and try to ask it to do something.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng felt frustrated about this. Moreover, with the lack of response from the ancestry-level bloodline, he was beginning to lose hope.</p>

  <p>But a few seconds later, to his surprise, he felt something trickling down his arm. He looked down and saw a drop of blood leaving his wound. It was the ancestry-level bloodline!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened. He could not believe what he was seeing in front of him. Since he had fused with it, this was the first time it had listened to him and left his body!</p>

  <p>It submitted to his request!</p>

  <p>'Yes!' Luo Zheng cheered, holding his arm as he stood up in excitement.</p>

  <p>Da! The others all heard and looked at the source of the sound. To everyone's surprise, it was the drop of blood.</p>

  <p>They knew how it would look, but no one was aware of how it weighed.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly enough, it was extremely heavy.</p>

  <p>It was only the size of a soybean, but it was so weighty that it fell to the ground with a loud thud, calling everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, the drop of blood that fell to the ground rolled towards the nearest wolf tooth. It climbed right on top of it and seeped into it until it could no longer be seen.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, the wolf tooth's once dull aura began to revitalize.</p>

  <p>Like an old man returning to his youth, the wolf tooth gained its strength back!</p>

  <p>The holes that once covered the tooth were filled. The cracks that were once there were suddenly gone. Its once gray color was replaced with a soft pearl.</p>

  <p>And its glow began to grow brighter and brighter. It was finally alive, and it was making itself known! Its impressive aura was reaching lengths far beyond it, filling the cave.</p>

  <p>It made it nearly impossible for the human heroes to breathe.</p>

  <p>"Is this the wolf tooth's true form?" the real Fuxi asked, astonishment evident in his tone.</p>

  <p>"This is what the Monkey Spirit King needs!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He had studied the wolf teeth for years. The stories he read and the people he discussed them with would speak of their tremendous power, but he secretly thought that the wolf teeth were too weak to awaken the sleeping Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>It was not until now, having seen the wolf tooth in its true form of vitality, did the Primeval Lord of Heaven realize it was truly full of power.</p>

  <p>It was so strong and powerful that its aura penetrated through the enchanted barriers of the cave. Even Tearrag, Hagar and Nereus, who remained outside of the cave to guard it from unwanted visitors, felt its aura.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, when they agreed to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's request, they did not have much hope in their hearts that they would succeed. They did it out of their sheer loyalty to the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Tearrag, having felt the revitalized aura of the wolf tooth, began to wear expressions of incredulity on his face.</p>

  <p>"These humans," he said, shaking his head in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Have they really repaired the wolf tooth?</p>

  <p>Are they really able to fix them?" he continued.</p>

  <p>He felt the excitement rush through his veins. Before his mind could even think about it, his feet were already moving, rushing inside of the cave.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He had just passed through one of the enchanted barriers outside the cave.</p>

  <p>There were several more ahead of him.</p>

  <p>With his exceptional strength, he knew he would be able to pass through all of them without a sweat.</p>

  <p>But then, he remembered the promise he had made to the Primeval Lord of Heaven. After they built the cave, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had made them promise that no matter what would happen, they would not enter the cave and pry into the process of awakening the Monkey Spirit King. And they agreed.</p>
