<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathan shot out of his place like an arrow, while Zheng and Mike waited where they were.</p>

  <p>Nathan returned ten minutes later, folded his hands respectfully towards Mike, and said, "I've informed the Cao Clan, but I can't tell what decision they will take."</p>

  <p>Mike nodded. "You did the right thing. It's a matter of life and death. The decision is theirs. You have done your part."</p>

  <p>As the master of a universe, he knew everyone in his universe like the back of his hand. With just a single thought, he could know a person's life history, from the moment they were born to this present moment.</p>

  <p>Nathan's talent was in no way inferior to Zheng's or Tianming's. But there was a vast difference in the experiences and births of the three warriors.</p>

  <p>Nathan had been loved and doted on by some Supreme Lords in the universe, causing him to become arrogant. But a series of trials and tribulations in the divine land led him to tone down his arrogant temperament.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand and pulled out the mountain token. He smiled at Nathan as he drew out a space channel. "You go in first," he said.</p>

  <p>"Me go in alone?" Nathan exclaimed, stunned.</p>

  <p>Questions were bubbling up within him.</p>

  <p>"Someone in the fairy palace will receive you. We have other things to do,"</p>

  <p>Zheng answered Nathan's unasked questions.</p>

  <p>Once Nathan entered the space channel, Mike stretched out his hand to activate Grand Teleportation. Soon, he and Zheng left Bright Night Region.</p>

  <p>In a house of the Bright Night City, the master of the Cao Clan, who had stopped his seclusion, looked cautious. He was silent for a long time before he directed his question to everyone. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>A while ago, Nathan had burst in and asked all the members of the Cao Clan to retreat from the city, telling them that if they did not leave, a great disaster would befall them and that everyone would die.</p>

  <p>"Dad, I believe Nathan," Bruno said. He admired Nathan, who had looked confident as he warned everyone. So Bruno chose to believe him even though he had not given a plausible reason for asking them to leave.</p>

  <p>"Abandoning the city will have a great impact on our clan! We should request the Bai Clan to make a decision about this. We should believe that they will protect us well, and we need to let them stand up for us and deal with our mess in the Bright Moon City. I think even if our enemies are Holy Beings, they will have scruples while going against the Bai Clan!" an elder of the Cao Clan said.</p>

  <p>"By the time the Bai Clan stands up for us, I'm afraid we'll all have been killed!" Bruno replied dryly.</p>

  <p>They didn't know that the Bai Clan weren't in the position of saving even themselves right now. They had been forced to bow down to the Han Clan and had yielded to the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>The master of the Cao Clan was silent for a long time before his eyes steeled and he said, "Bruno is right. I agree it is a big deal to leave the Bright Night City, even temporarily, but the loss is nothing compared to our lives. So I think it's time that every one of us must leave the city."</p>

  <p>The moment the Cao Clan gave the order, Bright Night City, quietly soaked in night, erupted in noise.</p>

  <p>Most people did not understand why the Cao Clan had ordered the evacuation of the divine city.</p>

  <p>But the Cao Clan ruled the divine city and had the right to expel the divine citizens if they must.</p>

  <p>The road leading out of the city was crammed with people, everyone hurrying to leave the city and make their way to this road from all directions.</p>

  <p>Many people didn't stray far from the city. They waited outside the city walls.</p>

  <p>It was not long after the city had been evacuated that a blue light suddenly appeared in the air above the city.</p>

  <p>A sturdy figure appeared in the light. Zavier.</p>

  <p>He was looking down rather impatiently.</p>

  <p>His combat strength was only second to Leyton's, among all the Yellow Emperor Guards. But Leyton had assigned the dirty work to him.</p>

  <p>Hamish's assignment was the easiest. He only needed to stay on the Floating Island to activate Yellow Emperor Magatama so that he could find any passing Yellow Emperor Guards. Zavier was furious at this "arrangement."</p>

  <p>Leyton had just told him to buckle up with collecting blood. He had told him that he needed to collect blood regardless of the consequences and irrespective of whether or not it was a central divine city.</p>

  <p>Zavier didn't think much about right and wrong since he was only following orders. He didn't need to travel around, trying to decide which cities to pick.</p>

  <p>He merely moved east from one city to the next after he had caught everyone in the city.</p>

  <p>He waved and an ancient round mirror appeared in his hand. The surface of the mirror rippled.</p>

  <p>He turned the mirror so it faced the city and muttered, "Collect!"</p>

  <p>An azure space force spread out from the sky and shrouded the Bright Night City.</p>

  <p>He had caught and collected people from tens of divine cities in a row. By now, he didn't bother investigating how many people there were in each city. He'd just catch them and send them to the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>But this time, he waited, but the mirror caught no one.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The scene puzzled him for a moment, and then, he realized what was going on. 'Have these ants gotten the news and run away?' he thought, flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>But Zavier didn't dwell on that. After all, there were more people in other divine cities, and it was easier to catch more people there.</p>

  <p>But since he had started here, he couldn't leave empty-handed.</p>

  <p>He looked around and his gaze fell on the people who were lingering outside the city.</p>

  <p>So he turned the bronze mirror to face the people outside the city, with the intention of collecting them.</p>

  <p>These people were not willing to leave the city, but they had to obey the Cao Clan's orders and leave. They were, however, hoping that they could return to the city when the order was revoked.</p>

  <p>When they saw the blue light above the city, an ominous feeling rose from the bottom of their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods fled as they spotted the blue light approaching them.</p>

  <p>But they were far slower than Zavier.</p>

  <p>The blue light released by the bronze mirror caught up with them and sucked them in.</p>

  <p>They felt the space around them freeze as they were absorbed into the sky and into the bronze mirror.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of people were taken away.</p>

  <p>Outside the city, a large number of people were fleeing. Zavier couldn't be bothered to pay attention to them, and began to move towards the next city.</p>

  <p>Tens of miles away from the city, the Cao Clan's people watched this scene, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"What method was that? He captured them all with a bronze mirror!"</p>

  <p>"That man's aura is strange. I can't figure out what kind of Godly Way he cultivates."</p>

  <p>"He is a Holy Being, right? I wonder which clan's Holy Being he is."</p>

  <p>The Cao Clan's members were relieved that they had survived a disaster and erupted in discussion.</p>

  <p>Had it not been for the master of the Cao Clan who had made the prompt decision to abandon the city, the entire Cao Clan would have been sucked into the bronze mirror.</p>

  <p>Most True Gods had lived for several divine eras but still hadn't gotten the chance to meet a Holy Being. To them, Holy Beings were strong and admirable.</p>

  <p>"No, he is not a Holy Being. He is stronger than a Holy Being,"</p>

  <p>Bruno said, slowly but with great certainty.</p>

  <p>"Who can be stronger than a Holy Being?" Bruno's father stared at him in confusion. "And how do you know?"</p>

  <p>Bruno smiled and replied, "Nathan told me about it."</p>
