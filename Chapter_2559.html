<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2559 Blood At The Sixth-grade </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Grand Elder, Erik as well as the rest of the crowd showed a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>Erik's face had darkened. He stared at Giacomo and asked, "Giacomo, do you know what you are talking about?"</p>

  <p>A strange expression gradually appeared on the Grand Elder's delicate and white face. She also stared at Giacomo indifferently and asked, "Did you just say that Luo Zheng is originally a member of our race?"</p>

  <p>Giacomo naturally knew that they wouldn't believe it. If he hadn't seen with his own eyes that Luo Zheng had absorbed a piece of blood wild bone, he wouldn't have believed it either.</p>

  <p>There were over all seven thousand people who had Chiyou's bloodline, and all of them lived in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower. It was quite incredible learning that a stranger had the same bloodline like them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw it with my own eyes. He has absorbed a wild bone containing Chiyou's bloodline." Giacomo clarified, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>Giacomo explained with such determination, but the rest still looked skeptical about it, especially Erik, who stared at him vigilantly and questioned, "Giacomo, are you playing some tricks?"</p>

  <p>Giacomo felt unhappy about the way Erik questioned. He sneered and said, "Since you don't believe me, let Grand Elder assess Luo Zheng. I believe that Luo Zheng can pass the test. It's not bad for Luo Zheng to get an extra blood of our race!"</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't have a need to transplant blood, the only remaining blood within one thousand years would naturally be given to Erik's friend.</p>

  <p>Erik became silent upon hearing Giacomo's response. It was true that they were on bad terms, but if what he said was true, it would be an advantage for him.</p>

  <p>"Stop arguing." The Grand Elder floated up gently and stopped in front of Luo Zheng, her attractive eyes staring at him. "Whether you have the blood of our Nine Li race, we can know it through a test at once. Erik, go and inform our clansmen to bring all the children of six years old or over. I'll take care of the preparation. Luo Zheng, you and our clansmen will participate in the blood purity test."</p>

  <p>After she gave out further instructions, she smiled at Luo Zheng. Gently twisting her waist, she retreated into the distance.</p>

  <p>A few moments passed.</p>

  <p>About four to five hundred people of the Nine Li race had gathered in the square. The crowd were immersed in whispers and discussion.</p>

  <p>"Why is the blood purity test advanced?"</p>

  <p>"It is said that an outsider has our bloodline, so they moved it ahead of the schedule."</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? Our race's blood is noble. How can an outsider have it?"</p>

  <p>"Could his blood be stolen?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. What do you think the blood is? Do you think you can steal it as you want?" "Even Grand Elder is unable to transplant blood..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Giacomo were just standing on one side of the square and heard the words spoken. With an embarrassed smile on his face, Giacomo explained, "Our Nine Li race always takes our bloodline seriously, so they probably have enmity towards you. Please don't take it to heart."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. Of course, he wouldn't make a fuss with these people.</p>

  <p>Everyone waited for a while, and a soft white flash flew over. The Grand Elder appeared in the center of the square. She spoke to everyone with a smile, "The blood purity test should have been held four months later.</p>

  <p>But we will get it earlier this time."</p>

  <p>The blood purity test was specifically used to test the purity of blood. It was held every few years. The test was specially prepared for the children who had just grown up in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Why must it be advanced?"</p>

  <p>"My daughter just turned six years old yesterday. That's so unfair for her to participate in the blood purity test!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, holding the blood purity test in advance for an outsider. Do you take him too seriously? What if he is lying?"</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race generally believed that to test the blood purity at the right age of children growing up would increase the purity of the blood.</p>

  <p>The purity of the blood was already set from the moment one was born.</p>

  <p>However, in order to seek greater benefits for their own children, the clansmen decided to appoint the blood purity test at the time the children reached six years of age.</p>

  <p>The Grand Elder slowly stretched out her hand and gently waved at the crowd. The clansmen in the square immediately quieted down. They heard her lightly say, "If you don't want to participate in the blood purity test, you can leave. The ones who stay here will start now."</p>

  <p>With a gentle clap of her hands, an oval array appeared in the center of the square. With the light in the array flickering, an oval jade floated up.</p>

  <p>The jade was about the size of a washbasin, emitting a faint milky white light. There were no flaws on its surface, looking like a huge egg.</p>

  <p>When the white jade fully appeared, the Grand Elder turned to Luo Zheng maintaining a faint smile, saying, "Luo Zheng, you can come over now."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He took a step and was about to walk over but was suddenly interrupted.</p>

  <p>A clansman unexpectedly emerged from the other side of the square and cried out, "Why do you ask an outsider to carry out the test first! My Jeffery and Frida have to take the test first!" As he spoke, a boy and a girl were brought forward each being carried on his arms.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, Luo Zheng stood still and casually shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>He naturally would never fight with the children.</p>

  <p>The Grand Elder shook her head slightly. These clansmen had always been very resistant to foreign people. She was a little helpless, but couldn't refute and say anything about it. She could only agree, "In that case, test Jeffery and Frida first."</p>

  <p>Jeffery and Frida were twins of six years old. Being brought in front of the beautiful white jade, the two children were elated and couldn't help but circle around it.</p>

  <p>The Grand Elder squatted in front of them and smiled sweetly. She reached out at Frida and gently grasped her hands.</p>

  <p>"Grand Elder, why are you holding my hand?" Frida asked, blinking her big eyes.</p>

  <p>"Because it will be a little painful," the Grand Elder explained. Her fingertip flashed a white light as thin as a needle and gently poked it on the tip of Frida's finger.</p>

  <p>Several drops of blood flowed out from her fingertip.</p>

  <p>Frida felt pain from her finger and was about to cry, but the Grand Elder already stretched out her arm gently touching her forehead. The pain immediately disappeared.</p>

  <p>As for the drops of blood, they were guided in midair by the Grand Elder. The drops of blood had fused, and they fell towards the jade.</p>

  <p>Bits of bright red blood blossomed on the jade's surface, and were swiftly absorbed by the jade in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The jade started to tremble. The pure white jade started to glow with red light, and was constantly turning fully red.</p>

  <p>"It's already the third-grade!" "And the color is still changing!"</p>

  <p>"It's the fourth-grade!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe Frida's blood could be above the fifth-grade?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you that the purity of Frida's blood is definitely great!" the clansman who had carried the two children in his arms before uttered in excitement.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the color of the jade stopped changing and became stable.</p>

  <p>The Grand Elder then announced flatly, "Frida's blood is at the top of sixth-grade, and will reach seventh-grade soon. Congratulations, Akshay!"</p>

  <p>The purity of blood was divided into ten grades. The sixth-grade blood was considered as a top grade in the Nine Li race. In the future, the girl would surely be of great importance in her race.</p>

  <p>Frida's father, Akshay, was naturally thrilled when he learned that her blood would reach the seventh-grade surely.</p>
