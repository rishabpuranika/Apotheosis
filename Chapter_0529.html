<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 529 Yan Needed Luo Zheng's Protection </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng returned to Cloud Sect, he continued cultivating without interruptions.</p>

  <p>There was only a half month left before the start of Cloud Road. If Luo Luo Zheng had not visited the Luo Clan, he would have focused entirely on cultivation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, both Hua Tianming and Patrick Pei had been absorbed in their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Tianming had stayed in the Seven Star Sword Light Platform and didn't leave even for a second. There, he could not only add greater flexibility to his sword, but he could reinforce his strength as well.</p>

  <p>Patrick didn't visit any practicing locations. His Buddhism cultivation method could not be improved by visiting any training places. His skills could only be enhanced through meditation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sister, Yan, didn't go back to Hell Mountain as there was only a half month left before Luo Luo Zheng had to go to Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Since Yan rarely got the opportunity to spend time with her brother, every moment was precious to her.</p>

  <p>Usually, Yan watched as Luo Luo Zheng practiced. She gazed at her brother as he exerted himself during his refinement. What she wanted was simple? to be around her brother. She didn't have much more to ask for.</p>

  <p>However, It seemed to be unfortunate for Yan? such a tiny wish of her was still hard to come true as she would have to say goodbye to her brother soon. Sometimes, Yan thought it would have been better if she and her brother had been born in an ordinary family. In that case, they would have been ordinary people and they could spend their lives peacefully. There wouldn't be so many difficulties and disasters in their lives, and they wouldn't have to work so hard to pursue something.</p>

  <p>Once a person decided to become a cultivator, hardships were part of their destiny. Not only would they obtain a lot, but they would also lose a lot.</p>

  <p>Today, Luo Luo Zheng had chosen to refine while sitting at the top of the mountain in Drizzle Peak. He was trying to use his life vitality to get past the bottleneck of grade four of the nature level.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Luo Luo Zheng had accumulated enough strength to break through on his own. He could simplify the process by consuming some pills as well. However, Luo Zheng's foundation and basic strength would suffer if he chose to use pills. Furthermore, taking help now would make it more difficult for him to break through a higher level in the future.</p>

  <p>Each time Luo Luo Zheng improved, it had happened naturally. Each time his life vitality reached its limit, Luo Luo Zheng would achieve a breakthrough. Since he had never taken external help when refining, it meant that his foundation was extraordinarily solid.</p>

  <p>Just as Yan was watching Luo Luo Zheng, a windstorm began.</p>

  <p>Thick clouds, like bales of cotton, were pulled closer as though grasped by an invisible hand.</p>

  <p>Yan's hair fluttered in the breeze. As the wind picked up speed, Yan's hair flew around her in a tangled mess. Luo Luo Zheng also sensed the threat and frowned.</p>

  <p>The clouds in the sky thundered as they crashed into each other. Soon, they took the form of a human face!</p>

  <p>"What is this? Great signs from heaven?" Luo Luo Zheng asked loudly. As he stared at the sky, Luo Luo Zheng could feel the power radiating from the clouds. The force was so strong that even Kenneth Shi, the strongest one at Cloud Sect could not compare with it!</p>

  <p>People beside Luo Luo Zheng and Yan had noticed such a large, abnormal cloud formation. All other disciples of Cloud Sect and even some people at the Imperial Capital were frightened by it.</p>

  <p>The face was so large that so many people could see it! Many people who saw the face wondered if it was God.</p>

  <p>Religious people fell to their knees and burned incense in reverence.</p>

  <p>They prayed to the skies with the hopes that the phenomenon was a blessing.</p>

  <p>But some warriors knew that God had not forced the clouds together to form a face. This was orchestrated by a man with great power who had projected his life vitality into the sky.</p>

  <p>What level would a person have to be at to case his life vitality to a faraway place and shape it as his face?</p>

  <p>Even though the warriors understood that this was no heavenly act, they were terrified. The man capable of such a feat must have power far beyond their imagination. They couldn't even begin to imagine how high this person's level must be. To the warriors in the Eastern Region, this man might as well be God as his power was so unimaginably frightening.</p>

  <p>Respect and admiration reflected on the faces of the warriors as they looked at the huge face in the sky.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's question, Yan smiled and shook her head. She didn't think that this phenomenon was connected to her.</p>

  <p>But soon, Yan found that she was wrong as her fate was decided in the next few minutes.</p>

  <p>Several seconds after its appearance, the lips on the cloud face began moving. "Kenneth Shi! Kenneth Shi! Come out now!"</p>

  <p>The sound seemed to come from the sky, and each syllable was as loud as thunder.</p>

  <p>People cowered in fear as it sounded like the voice was exploding beside their ears.</p>

  <p>"The huge face in the sky has come to meet Master Shi?" Luo Zheng's heart beat faster. Although he knew the huge face had not come for him, he felt a sense of foreboding.</p>

  <p>"Kenneth Shi, Come outside!" The voice roared.</p>

  <p>Soon a black dot flew to the sky. It was the leader of the Cloud Sect, Kenneth Shi.</p>

  <p>"Where is Yan Luo? Isn't she refining at Hell Mountain? Why did I sense that she was not at Cloud Sect a few days ago?"</p>

  <p>Each word from the large face's mouth was as loud as thunder. Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up when he heard the face in the clouds asking about Yan.</p>

  <p>Moments later, his face paled and killing intent appeared in his eyes!</p>

  <p>The person who was projecting his vitality here was asking about Yan!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glared at the large face without blinking as he wanted to memorize all the features. Never in his life would he want to forget what this powerful man looked like.</p>

  <p>After all, this was the man who planned to make the Lustful Demon Array! It was this man who wanted to rob Yan of her virginity.</p>

  <p>The more power that radiated from the colossal face, the smaller Luo Luo Zheng felt himself be. In the past few years, he had refined and cultivated his strength to inspiring levels. However, when confronted by the power of this man, Luo Luo Zheng felt as weak as an ant. As angry as he was, Luo Luo Zheng didn't feel as though he could leave an impression on the man.</p>

  <p>After Kenneth whispered something to the huge face, the face turned to Yan and said, "Hmmm, Her improvement is too slow. You only have one month left to send her to me. Of course, I have ways to help her into the Internal Elixir Realm!"</p>

  <p>Stunned expressions could be seen on the faces of all the people and cultivators after they heard what the huge face said.</p>

  <p>Was it so easy to step into the Internal Elixir Realm?</p>

  <p>A warrior had to pass numerous challenges and spend several years completing tasks before entering the Illuminating Soul Realm. Reaching the consummation of the Illuminating Soul Realm was as rare as a diamond in the rough. A man at the culmination of the Illuminating Soul Realm could rarely meet a rival in his life.</p>

  <p>The Internal Elixir Realm was even more demanding!</p>

  <p>A warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm was the sovereign existence in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>It was estimated that perhaps no more than ten cultivators at the Internal Elixir Realm existed in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>But, now the face said that he was going to help Yan step into the Internal Elixir Realm! Even though Yan had great talent, helping her reach the Internal Elixir Realm would require superhuman skills.</p>

  <p>But no one thought that the huge face was exaggerating. By changing and projecting his life vitality over Cloud Sect, this person had already proven that he had unimaginable power. So people thought it was reasonable for him to give such incredible reassurances.</p>

  <p>Several disciples of Cloud Sect felt jealous of Yan. The chance to enter the Internal Elixir Realm meant becoming one of the strongest people in the Eastern Region. And almost everyone had dreamed of achieving that!</p>

  <p>But Yan didn't feel the same way as the other disciples.</p>

  <p>Once the huge face stopped speaking, Yan rushed to her brother and hid in his arms. Her slim body trembled from fear.</p>

  <p>The entire time that she was imprisoned at Hell Mountain, Yan knew what awaited her in the future. But she didn't fear it as much then as she thought she could choose to die. If she was forced to do what she was unwilling to, she could find an opportunity to end her life. At least her body would be untouched by a man she didn't like.</p>

  <p>At that time, Yan was desperate. There was no hope in her life, and of course, she was not afraid of anything.</p>

  <p>But now Yan had found hope through her brother.</p>

  <p>Once she had found hope, she looked forward to extending it and dreamed that it would come true. At the same time, she feared that she would lose all her hope.</p>

  <p>This fear is what made Yan tremble.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng held his sister and tried to calm her. He felt as though his sister was like a poor baby deer with great fear in her heart.</p>

  <p>"Yan, please try to relax. I am always here." Luo Luo Zheng looked at the huge face while he reassured his sister. He now had a better idea of the obstacles he would face in his path.</p>

  <p>He knew he would have to conquer these by himself! That meant he needed to kill this man!</p>

  <p>Kenneth seemed to be whispering something to the huge face again.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, the huge face replied, "Okay! Good. If I don't see Yan Luo in a month, Cloud Sect will no longer exist in the world! You can try if you don't believe me! Haha!" After he finished, the large eyes of the face in the clouds turned toward Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stiffened. Apparently, he could feel the glare of the huge face. Luo Luo Zheng didn't try to hide. His eyes glistened with determination as he stared back at the huge face.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" The man found Luo Zheng's reaction to be unusual. But he didn't say anything. Instead, after flashing a cold smile, the huge face disappeared from the sky as if it had never been there.</p>
