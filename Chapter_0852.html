<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 852 Concession And Dispute (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Malcom huffed, "You have a way to solve this? Tell me right now!"</p>

  <p>"Since those humans insist that we obey the rules, then we should give them what they want," Boris said. "We don't need to compensate them with ten sacred weapons. When Zheng comes out of the Talent Tablet, I'll challenge him and kill him on the arena!"</p>

  <p>His words were confident as if he already knew who the winner of the battle was before it even began.</p>

  <p>Malcom, Fabian, and Jarrod all showed an expression of interest with Boris's proposal.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod knew the human race did not have any bargaining chips in their hands to negotiate with the ogres. Their best bet was to get Zheng up in that arena and win. His victory would serve to further strengthen the importance of the rules and help humans gain the other races' support.</p>

  <p>Malcom, on the other hand, thought differently. Boris, to him, was the most outstanding talent in the ogre's two sacred places and his cultivation base was a full cultivation realm higher than Zheng's. The gap between a tenth-level war fighter and a tenth-level war general was too great.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Malcom had no doubts that Boris would be able to kill Zheng in the arena. This method would ensure that the ogres wouldn't be breaking any rules so there would be no need to compensate the humans and they could legally get rid of Zheng. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p>

  <p>In the unlikely event that Boris did fail, the ogres would still be able to ignore the rules and kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>Malcom let out a roaring laugh. "I agree with this suggestion! What do you humans think?"</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod chose not to say anything. The ogre's agreement to fight in the arena was already a kind of concession. Although their hearts were full of worry, Fabian and Jarrod only nodded their heads.</p>

  <p>Olivia faintly sighed as she looked up at Zheng's name shining on the wall.</p>

  <p>She wasn't an idiot and obviously knew the ogres' malicious intentions.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng defeated Boris, the ogres might not also be willing to abide by the rules. Only hatred and competition existed between the two races, after all.</p>

  <p>'Zheng should not have entered the Tower of Sin. He should've just slowly grown and enhanced his cultivation in the Purple Heart Sacred Place. At the very least, he should have had enough strength to face off against these ogre war lords before he entered the tower. That should've been the perfect plan.</p>

  <p>With his talent, he probably doesn't even need the tower's help. As long as he focuses on his cultivation, a breakthrough isn't way too far off. Ah, why have things come to this?'</p>

  <p>Olivia thought morosely, regretting Zheng's choices for him.</p>

  <p>Of course, she had no idea that Zheng did not have the time nor the luxury to cultivate slowly. His sister waited for him to rescue her and, with each passing day, his worries only increased since he felt that there was no time at all.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was the only place where he could quickly raise his cultivation base. He had no other choice.</p>

  <p>Besides, a talent would only grow stronger and far more powerful after going through a life or death experience. A peaceful environment could never yield an awe-inspiring hero.</p>

  <p>Everyone fell silent upon the presentation of this solution. The only thing to do now was to wait for Zheng to come out of the Talent Tablet and accept Boris's challenge.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the perfect plan but it ultimately resolved the dispute.</p>

  <p>However, four hours had already passed. Why was Zheng undergoing such a long test? What exactly did he encounter inside the Talent Tablet?</p>

  <p>Zheng was completely unaware of the huge dispute happening outside because of him. At that moment, he was currently dealing with the Soul Symbols one by one.</p>

  <p>The masters of these Soul Symbols had exceptionally powerful cultivation bases and it was still extremely difficult for Zheng to defeat them despite the suppression of their cultivation bases to that of a tenth-level war fighter.</p>

  <p>"The ninth Soul Symbol..."</p>

  <p>Zheng had just managed to destroy another master's Soul Symbol.</p>

  <p>He had exhausted almost all his methods but, in the end, had to rely on the Fighting Soul to disturb the opponent's mind before he managed to kill him.</p>

  <p>"How many Soul Symbols do I have to deal with?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Ten," the weapon spirit said faintly. "You only need to defeat ten masters' Soul Symbols for you to pass the final test."</p>

  <p>"Ten? Then this is the last one…"</p>

  <p>With this, Zheng noticed that the serried patterns started to disappear until there was only one left right in front of him.</p>

  <p>The pattern suddenly lunged at Zheng and, with a powerful flash of light, a person appeared.</p>

  <p>The light blinded Zheng for a few seconds before he could look at the one standing in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Astonishment was written all over Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Although the person in front of him had eyes and nose the same way all others had eyes and noses, the aura he exuded was very strange and it reminded Zheng of the similar feeling he had when he met Lily, his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Back then, he had been shocked by her appearance.</p>

  <p>Her slender legs and beautiful face were aesthetically perfect and Zheng could only marvel at such a wonderful creation.</p>

  <p>Only after arriving at the Sea God Continent did Zheng realize that his horizons were simply limited. The Demon Night was a perfect race with men and women at the height of beauty and aesthetic splendor.</p>

  <p>However, the Demon Night members were not humans and their long, pointed ears were physical proof of this fact.</p>

  <p>The 'person' in front of Zheng right now looked like a genuine human male.</p>

  <p>Ears, eyebrows, eyes, body...</p>

  <p>His appearance was the same as a normal human's and nothing seemed out of place as Zheng carefully looked him up and down.</p>

  <p>Zheng praised this 'person' in his heart for he never thought such a perfect human could exist in this world.</p>

  <p>The 'person' was flawless and perfect, and his perfection was the reason why Zheng couldn't be too sure that he was really a human being.</p>

  <p>"Is he a real human?" he voiced his thoughts out loud.</p>

  <p>"He can't be regarded as a human being," the weapon spirit replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. "Then what race does he belong to?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He is the owner of the Tower of Sin. A member of the Celestial Position race!" The weapon spirit's revelation almost popped Zheng's eyes out of his sockets.</p>

  <p>"The Celestial Position race? What kind of race is that? Why do they look so much like humans?" The Demon Night was a perfect race but this man in front of him, despite being perfect himself, looked as if he had more in common with humans.</p>

  <p>"I am unable to answer this question…" the weapon spirit replied.</p>

  <p>"His Soul Symbol appears here," Zheng said and bit his lip in thought. "Then does that mean that the owner of the Tower of Sin has already died?"</p>

  <p>"Right, this is the last Soul Symbol," the weapon spirit affirmed. "As long as you defeat him, you may pass the final test."</p>

  <p>"I see…"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face no longer showed any doubt. No matter what the Celestial Position race was, as long as he defeated this perfect man, Zheng would pass the test.</p>

  <p>This time, it wasn't Zheng who made the first move.</p>

  <p>There was no mockery or hesitation. The last Soul Symbol went and charged towards Zheng in swift, assured steps.</p>

  <p>'No waves of forceful energy and life vitality? His cultivation base is suppressed to my level. Is he planning to use only his physical body to fight against me?' Zheng thought to himself, slightly confused and alarmed at how things had started. However, he quickly recovered and got himself ready. "If that's the case, then let's see how much power is stored in that perfect body of you!"</p>

  <p>He put away his long sword and met with the man head-on, also using his physical body to ram into his opponent.</p>

  <p>Zheng was confident with his physical strength since only a few people could keep up with him in the Sea God Continent and even in the boundless world! After all, his body was a high-grade fairy weapon and it was enough to turn Zheng into a mean fighting machine.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The two of them collided in the most barbaric fashion with a loud bang indicating the amount of strength they had put into their tackles.</p>

  <p>The collision produced a force that was so strong that it sent the two of them reeling backward, away from each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng flew a couple of feet in the air before landing painfully on the cold, hard floor. However, despite the pain he should be feeling, his mind was more focused on the shocking fact that his opponent was still alive. Just then, a primary-level war lord hit by Zheng's attack would've been severely wounded after the collision but it seemed his perfect opponent was only thrown a few feet backward.</p>

  <p>Sure, they were both thrown a good few feet backward, but compared to the distance Zheng was thrown, the perfect man's retreat distance was significantly shorter!</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it is such a powerful physical body. It's not the slightest bit weaker than my fairy weapon body!"</p>

  <p>Doubt also appeared on the perfect man's face. Despite being a mere Soul Symbol, he had still inherited the emotions of his previous master and regarded Zheng's powerful physical body as inconceivable.</p>

  <p>"AGAIN!"</p>

  <p>Zheng roared as he circulated the power of the dragon scales in his body, activating one hundred scales.</p>

  <p>"BANG!"</p>

  <p>There was another violent force as the two collided once again. Zheng was pushed back a hundred feet, but his opponent was pushed back for one hundred and fifty feet!</p>

  <p>"AGAIN!"</p>

  <p>"BANG!"</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to unfurl the dragon scales' power bit by bit, increasing his strength gradually. Over time, the distance Zheng would be thrown back decreased while his opponent moved farther and farther backward. On their next collision, a stream of blood flowed out of the man's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Golden blood?" The sight of it solidified Zheng's belief that his opponent was not human. How could a mere human being possess golden blood?</p>

  <p>The perfect man wiped away the blood from his mouth. Then he finally realized that he would not be able to win this battle with his physical strength alone. If this continued, he would be the one collapsing in the end.</p>

  <p>The perfect man changed his pose and suddenly clenched one of his hands into a fist.</p>

  <p>Faint traces of light appeared around his hand before forming a powerful looking vortex.</p>

  <p>'That's the forceful energy, ' Zheng thought to himself. 'Although he was of the Celestial Position race, he still chose to refine his body. Since that's the case, I'll also show him my body refining technique!'</p>

  <p>At that moment, victory was no longer Zheng's goal. What he hoped instead was a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>"Stellar Body!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had never used the Stellar Body in actual combat, but now he would finally get a chance. Now, he would see how powerful the Transcendent Divine Might truly was.</p>
