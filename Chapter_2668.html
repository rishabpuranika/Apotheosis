<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2668 The Heavenly Mirror Shield </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, ahead of the long queue of the Nine Li race's Wild Gods, there was an oval-shaped transmission door.</p>

  <p>This transmission door led to Timotheus's inner world.</p>

  <p>Timotheus had already created a separate continent in his inner world.</p>

  <p>And on that continent, he had created a huge bone tower.</p>

  <p>After all, it was not easy for these Wild Gods to leave the bone tower, so he wanted to protect their emotions and put them at ease as much as possible.</p>

  <p>Even so, there were still many Wild Gods who chose to stay.</p>

  <p>These Wild Gods were standing on the other side of the cave, silently watching the great migration of their people with a myriad of emotions on their faces.</p>

  <p>The bad news was that with the departure of the exiles, the Wild Gods would lose their main source of protection.</p>

  <p>But on the bright side, the exiles of the other races were also leaving.</p>

  <p>This meant that the remaining Wild Gods, with their bloodlines, would still be qualified to dominate this world.</p>

  <p>Most of the Wild Gods had already entered Timotheus' inner world, and the exiles were saying goodbye to the rest of the Wild Gods who had chosen to stay behind.</p>

  <p>After all, the exiles and their race members had a deep relationship.</p>

  <p>Before they left, the exiles gave the Wild Gods a lot of extremely powerful magic weapons and left behind a large number of cultivation resources.</p>

  <p>Once it was all over, the remaining Wild Gods left the Sky Spirit Bone Tower and gathered with Emily and the others.</p>

  <p>Back when the exiles had just cut off their curses, Emily and Timotheus had warned all of them not to think about taking that ship.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the exiles had listened to Emily and Timotheus. Besides, the ship had originally been under the control of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng, Timotheus, and Leopold all looked toward the north, where the Torrent Bone Tower was located.</p>

  <p>Even from a long distance, they could see a faint yellow light floating in the sky. That tiny dot was the divine land.</p>

  <p>Although it was barely visible to the naked eye, it filled Zheng with a sense of excitement. He had been longing for the day he could finally return to the divine land.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Timotheus, Leopold, and the others had complicated emotions.</p>

  <p>As members of the Nine Li race, they were astonished and unable to accept the fact that their race had been defeated and destroyed by the Yellow Emperor.</p>

  <p>Now, the divine land was their only hope, so they had to support Zheng and do their best for their race.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," said Emily lightly.</p>

  <p>The exiles of the two big races led Zheng down to the Torrent Bone Tower after performing the Grand Teleportation technique several times.</p>

  <p>At the top of the Torrent Bone Tower, a ribbon of blood-red light extended upward, firmly binding the divine land.</p>

  <p>"After we arrive at the divine land, I'll release the shadow of Snake Goddess," said Emily.</p>

  <p>The ribbon of light was formed by the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>They hadn't released the shadow yet because Zheng had repaired the power of the divine land. Once this ribbon of blood-red light was unfastened, the divine land, with no force to bind it any longer, would fly upward, leaving the bottom of the chaos. If that happened, it wouldn't be easy to get it back.</p>

  <p>Without exchanging too many words, everyone began to move upward with the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>This bone tower was trillions of feet high. It would take years for Zheng and some of the others to climb it on their own.</p>

  <p>But with the help of the masters at the Other Shore Realm, they reached the top of the bone tower in a few hours.</p>

  <p>The divine land, which, from a distance, had been the size of an egg, now looked very large. It was like a giant gem that stood out in the sky, emitting a beautiful aura of magic.</p>

  <p>But the group didn't stop there. They passed the top of the Torrent Bone Tower and continued to move through space, shuttling, moving, and shuttling...</p>

  <p>A few days later, they arrived at the left side of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Compared to the vast divine land, their bodies were smaller than specks of dust.</p>

  <p>Emily and the others were shocked when they faced the giant land at such a close range.</p>

  <p>"It was made by the Lord of Weapons! What a great ship!" Emily couldn't help marveling out loud.</p>

  <p>When Timotheus, Leopold, and the others heard this, a triumphant expression appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>The mighty warriors of the Source World all had their own methods and contributions, but it was clear that Chiyou deserved his title of "Lord of Weapons".</p>

  <p>This ship was the last hope of the Nine Li race. Presumably, it would have taken Chiyou a lot of effort to create the divine land in the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Grand Chieftain's work is marvelous, of course," Timotheus said with an excited laugh. "Let's go in."</p>

  <p>Then, he took a step forward in mid-air and prepared to perform the Grand Teleportation technique so that he could move into the void and enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>But just as he slid into the void, there was a muffled bang.</p>

  <p>The next moment, he was flung out of the void, and his face was full of astonishment.</p>

  <p>An unreadable expression flashed through Emily's eyes when she saw this scene. "Does this ship have a space barrier that seals it off from the surrounding space?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus, who looked embarrassed, smoothed his beard and said,</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Grand Chieftain would have definitely put some protective measures in place."</p>

  <p>"How could this be? It was all right when I left..." A strange look flashed in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>He had been directly sent out of the divine land by his mother. But at that time, he had not encountered any space barrier.</p>

  <p>Ramzi cast an indifferent look at Zheng and said, "You belong to the divine land, so it's easy for you to get in and out of it. However, the rest of us are naturally excluded by the divine land."</p>

  <p>"There's still something wrong," Zheng uttered, shaking his head. "If that was the case, why can those Yellow Emperor Guards enter the divine land?"</p>

  <p>With a faint smile on her face, Emily tapped the tip of her toe and floated forward. "They must have spent a great deal of effort in figuring out how to enter the divine land. Perhaps they found a method to destroy the outer wall of the divine land."</p>

  <p>As she spoke these words, a fierceness filled her eyes and several colorful spots of light flashed between her pale fingers.</p>

  <p>Each colorful spot of light contained an extremely terrifying amount of energy.</p>

  <p>They whirled around, producing a cone-shaped spiral.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>With a slight flick of her slender finger, Emily shot the cone-shaped spiral toward the outer wall of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The cone-shaped spiral spun fast against the outer wall of the divine land before it exploded, emitting a dazzling ball of light that everyone watched with bated breath.</p>

  <p>But soon, the ball of light faded off without a trace, and the expressions of the warriors at the Other Shore Realm changed drastically.</p>

  <p>The outer wall of the divine land was still emitting a faint yellow light, and in the middle of the light loomed a triangular shadow that seemed to be the shield.</p>

  <p>With the protection of this shield shadow, the outer wall of the divine land had stood firmly against Emily's powerful attack.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Emily's face. "The work of the Lord of Weapons is too extraordinary..."</p>

  <p>Emily was the strongest among these warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>If even she was unable to break through the outer wall of the divine land, it would be impossible for the rest of them. Their expressions froze in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"It's the Heavenly Mirror Shield. I didn't expect Grand Chieftain to integrate it into the divine land. We're in trouble now," said Leopold, frowning as he looked at the fading shield shadow.</p>
