<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All these supreme disciples, including Finlay, were confused.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Zheng was and how great his talent, Zheng was still a nature creature in essence. Even though he had successfully challenged cultivators at higher levels, he was still a nature creature! He should not be able to go beyond the limit of nature creatures!</p>

  <p>For example, one of these conditions was that nature creatures could not fly.</p>

  <p>This limitation was related to the principle of life vitality. Only after entering the Illuminating Soul Realm could cultivators fly and stay in mid-air by burning their life vitality.</p>

  <p>In this way, no matter how high a nature creature's jump, he could not stay in the air and would eventually fall to the ground. There had never been a nature creature breaking this rule from the earliest times to the present day.</p>

  <p>But what had they just seen? Zheng had stayed steady in the air after he avoided the shot from Finlay. They could not believe their eyes, and they could not understand this incredible feat.</p>

  <p>Their expressions also revealed their complicated inner feelings.</p>

  <p>Unlike the people below, Zheng was very calm as he levitated in the air.</p>

  <p>His lips moved slightly as a subtle smile danced at the corner of his mouth. He lowered his voice and spoke to Tia via her token, "I didn't expect that you would be kind to me!"</p>

  <p>However, the smile was wiped from Zheng's face by Tia's response. "If you die like this, how will my hate be relieved?" Tia chuckled, "I prefer to torture you slowly and gradually. After today, you will come here and challenge the elite disciples of Cloud Hall every day! Wouldn't that be more interesting than a quick death?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng forced a wry smile. Although it was beneficial for him to have the support of a powerful cultivator at Cloud Hall, it really didn't have to be cultivated in this way.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng did not have other choices.</p>

  <p>And his opponent did not give him much time to think about alternatives.</p>

  <p>Finlay was surprised to see Zheng fly, but that did not mean that he would let Zheng go easily. Flying was a normal ability for cultivators at the Illuminating Soul Realm, not to mention that Finlay was at the ninth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>After a brief moment of surprise, Finlay recovered and focused on his battle with Zheng. He turned his weapon towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was incredibly agile in his movements. He effortlessly dodged Finlay's attack. Finlay chased Zheng around the area for a while.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he lashed out with his weapon dozens of times but could not injure Zheng.</p>

  <p>Finlay had not figured out how and why Zheng was so agile. A light ray had cut through the space and connected Zheng's body to Morphens' hands in the other place. This invisible ray allowed Morphens to control Zheng like a puppet.</p>

  <p>In this situation, it would be impossible for Finlay to catch up with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if he could, Finlay was no match for Zheng. After all, Morphens' puppet controlling skills had reached the legendary Fusion Realm, which meant that he could transfer his strength to Zheng during the fight. So, Finlay was not combating with Zheng alone. Instead, he was fighting against Zheng and Morphens.</p>

  <p>After seeing this chase and running match for some time, Tia stretched and yawned before saying, "Okay, that's enough for today. We'll let Zheng provoke them again later. It is better to keep the disciples fuming.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, there will be no interesting play tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Morphens nodded as his rough fingers moved dexterously, controlling Zheng's actions as per Tia's order. Zheng was like a puppet again. His helplessness was reflected in his eyes. Zheng couldn't do anything, and he even couldn't control his mouth. He shouted proudly, "Hah, hah, hah.</p>

  <p>Are you really the elites of Cloud Hall? I believe you are nothing. I will come here every day to accept your challenges. Let me see how strong you are! You idiots!"</p>

  <p>The elite disciples of Cloud Hall had changed their minds about challenging Zheng when they saw his super strength. However, Zheng's haughty declaration had successfully motivated them to fight. They had encountered arrogant people before, but none had ever humiliated them to such an extent. As disciples of Cloud Hall, they were also very talented that they were considered geniuses. Fueled by their passion and confidence of their abilities, these disciples would not bear Zheng's insults.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the grey building filled with agitated retorts from the disciples!</p>

  <p>However, their comments did not affect Zheng. He broke the gate of the building and flew away.</p>

  <p>After hovering in the air for a while, Zheng finally fell to the ground like a normal nature creature. Only at this moment could he regain control of his body. He felt speechless and helpless and shook his head slightly. He said to the token again, "Tia. Or should I call you young master? Could you stop playing with me like that? I beg the beautiful young lady to be merciful!"</p>

  <p>However, Tia did not change her mind after hearing Zheng's appeal. Her excited voice was transferred through the acoustic token. "No way! Rest for the remainder of the day. We will continue tomorrow morning!"</p>

  <p>Zheng wrinkled his face as he thought about his dilemma. He couldn't find a logical way to dissuade Tia. He felt as though he were dough, being kneaded by Tia in whatever shape she liked.</p>

  <p>Zheng accepted his fate. After all, he also benefited from such practice. He had acquired a deep understanding of the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death after using it in actual combat this night. So, he did not rest, as Tia suggested. Instead, he cultivated diligently through the night. Then, early the next morning, he sensed a little energy wave close to him but did not get the chance to dodge it. When the energy entered his body, Zheng trembled slightly before losing control of his body again.</p>

  <p>He then opened the door and ran toward the grey building.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is necessary to be here so early?" he asked gloomily.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Tia did not deprive Zheng of his right to speak. He could only resist verbally.</p>

  <p>"I told you before. You need to go there every day." Tia replied calmly.</p>

  <p>By now, Zheng had become famous throughout Cloud Hall for beating Frank and speaking audaciously to the other disciples of the Elite House.</p>

  <p>The strength of the disciples of Elite House varied from the initial phase to the highest level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. These young and energetic disciples felt angry when they heard Zheng's words. How could a new disciple be so insolent? They wanted to teach him a lesson so that Zheng would know the true extent of their strength and recant his insult.</p>

  <p>The grey building was initially used as an internal practice place for the disciples of Elite House. Not many would exercise there, as these disciples were either busy with their assignments or their cultivation.</p>

  <p>However, hundreds of cultivators were present in the grey building today. And most of them were between the fourth and sixth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Few were between the seventh and ninth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The disciples of Elite House had been selected from millions of cultivators. Everyone was exceptionally talented, at least in comparison to human-level talent. There were also some geniuses of earth-level talent and a few disciples that had reached heavenly-level talent. Now, they stood in the grey building, chatting about Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I want to see this nature creature! I have never encountered such an arrogant boy in my life!"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't arrived yet. Is he afraid of death, which is why he has not dared to come? I heard that this boy could fly even though he is only a nature creature. That is so strange!"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, if that boy said he would come, then he will. I do not understand his plans, though. How does he benefit from offending the disciples of Elite House?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows! Some people are happy to speak nonsense. Everyone here today would be happy to beat him severely so that he will remember not to speak so pretentiously again."</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, another young man in brown linen entered. He was tall and strong. His shape was similar to Kenneth's. He had a broad forehead, and his eyes were as sharp as an eagle's.</p>

  <p>"Look, that is Fred! He has also come here!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! Even the cultivator at the highest level of the Illuminating Soul Realm is present today. Zheng is going to die, right?"</p>

  <p>Someone who knew Fred Li walked up to him and greeted him, "Hello, Fred. You also heard yesterday's challenge?"</p>

  <p>Fred nodded and smiled as he spoke, "Yes, I just finished one task, and have some free time. I heard a very arrogant disciple recently joined Elite House. So, I came here for some fun. I want to see who this boy is and why he is so arrogant."</p>

  <p>"Fred, why don't you teach him a lesson? The young guy is really crazy.</p>

  <p>He comes from a grade two sect in the little Eastern Region. He has no idea about the outer world! So, he thought he was the best of all the disciples and looked down upon all of us!" A disciple told Fred angrily.</p>

  <p>However, Fred shook his head and said honestly, "Everyone has confidence. And many people are ready to challenge him. He will receive his lesson. He is just a nature creature! Even if I win, there will be nothing to blow off."</p>

  <p>"Fred is right. He is just a nature creature. There is no need for Fred to challenge him! He doesn't deserve the chance to practice with Fred!" The other disciple commented.</p>

  <p>"There he comes! Look!"</p>

  <p>Zheng finally appeared at the door of the grey building. Even though he was unwilling to move, his body was out of his control and stepped into the building.</p>

  <p>The disciples of Elite House glared at Zheng with sharp eyes. Most of them were seeing Zheng for the first time.</p>

  <p>Before today, many of the disciples did not believe that Zheng, with the strength of a nature creature, had defeated Frank. Now, as Zheng stood before them, the disciples were surprised that the rumor was true. What was even more shocking was that Zheng had not even reached the peak of the nature level. He was only at the fourth grade of the nature level!</p>

  <p>If Zheng had not been so arrogant, most people would be amazed by Zheng's strength. If Zheng was so strong at this level, would he have the power to challenge cultivators at the Internal Elixir Realm when he entered the Illuminating Soul Realm?</p>

  <p>However, since Zheng had been so proud, the disciples of Elite House were displeased and would not praise Zheng. So, they glared at Zheng, with killing intents in their eyes. It seemed as though they wanted to vaporize Zheng on the spot.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they also noticed something strange. He had an innocent and honest expression on his face even though his words were haughty, "Hmmm, all the unskilled elites are here. Have you been waiting for me for a long time?" After saying this, Zheng's face turned black again. Then he quietly cursed Tia a million times.</p>
