  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2632 Start The Strength Equalizing token </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned slightly at these words.</p>

  <p>He was not satisfied with the power of the Falling Star Palm, but that didn't mean that he underestimated the truth token.</p>

  <p>According to what No. 9527 had said, the truth should be comprehended from the fusion of Divine Dao. This kind of energy might be related to the nature of the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had condensed out the Truth Crystal, he hadn't mastered its essence completely. It had formed quickly because of his bloodline.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Warden race must be quite powerful.</p>

  <p>They believed in Herbert and carried out his orders to control the world.</p>

  <p>They must have learned many tricks from him.</p>

  <p>If so, how would Emily and Timotheus deal with it?</p>

  <p>"Can I really go up against the Strength Equalizing token with my Falling Star Palm?" Luo Zheng asked, still not convinced. He still couldn't understand how a token that did not meet actual combat requirements could be used to fight against a powerful token like Herbert's.</p>

  <p>"You'll know when the time comes," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Since it spoke with confidence, Luo Zheng nodded and didn't ask any more questions. He followed the crowd in silence.</p>

  <p>With the formidable strength of the exiles and Zelda herself at the helm, the team had become unstoppable.</p>

  <p>Although exiles from a few small races had repeatedly attempted to assassinate the team members, the team had easily dealt with them and even killed some of those exiles.</p>

  <p id="top_19"><a id="p14749" class="calibre2"></a>In three days, the team covered tens of thousands of miles in this space.</p>

  <p>When the once-distant high platforms finally came into view, many of the team members' eyes lit up in excitement.</p>

  <p>After all, the expedition they had embarked on was a large one, but it had gone smoothly so far. Ever since they had entered this space, they had lost only one companion, Quintin; they had traveled the rest of the distance without meeting any great difficulty.</p>

  <p>But Emily, Timotheus, and a few other people were not as optimistic.</p>

  <p>The journey had gone far too smoothly for their taste; they couldn't help but find it abnormal.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they were not only fighting against Spark, but also against the exiles of the small races. Besides, their real opponent was the Warden race.</p>

  <p>And so far, the Warden race had not shown up or made any moves.</p>

  <p>This was the biggest worry.</p>

  <p>"Zelda, does the Warden race live here?" Emily asked, looking at the tall platforms.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zelda replied. She was very familiar with the place where she was born. Then, she added, "These tall platforms are the towers of captivity.</p>

  <p>They're used to imprison all the living beings in the world. There are 200, 000 of them in total."</p>

  <p>Every tower of captivity was connected to countless Curse Chains, and all the living beings in the world were trapped on the tall platforms.</p>

  <p>"Can we destroy these tall platforms?" Emily asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Zelda shook her head. "These tall platforms were created by the Chaos Ancient God. You can't destroy them."</p>

  <p>But Leopold, a member of the Nine Li race, didn't believe her. He smiled faintly and said, "Let me have a try!"</p>

  <p>Zelda didn't stop him because she thought that there was no harm in him trying.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Leopold abruptly lifted himself up off the ground and clenched his fist.</p>

  <p>Soon, a black spiral of light began to circle his fist.</p>

  <p>Although the energy swirling in the spiral was extremely powerful, it had been completely contained without any energy leaking.</p>

  <p>With a loud roar, Leopold threw a punch.</p>

  <p>The black spiral turned into a black fist shadow, shooting toward one of the tall platforms.</p>

  <p>When the spiral touched the tall platform, it burst into pieces.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a loud rumble, the energy, which had been condensed to the maximum limit, exploded.</p>

  <p>If this had happened in the outside world, the earth would have been shaking by now. The mere presence of that force would have been enough to create a hurricane capable of tearing mountains apart.</p>

  <p>But here, aside from that loud noise, there was no indication that such a power had even existed.</p>

  <p>"My power...it was absorbed?" There was a hint of surprise on Leopold's face.</p>

  <p>However, Emily and Timotheus looked just as indifferent as before.</p>

  <p>They knew that they couldn't resist the power of the Chaos Ancient God and that anything could happen here.</p>

  <p>Emily was very clear that the people they actually relied on were Zelda and Luther.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. We have to enter the center of these tall platforms," said Zelda.</p>

  <p>After seeing Leopold's failed attempt to destroy one of the tall platforms, the rest of the team walked silently into the platforms from below one after another.</p>

  <p>Deep in these tall platforms, Spark stood impatiently, his face darkening.</p>

  <p>The black light was like a venomous snake that kept shooting out and coming back.</p>

  <p>He had lost half the exiles around him, and they had all been killed by Emily, Timotheus, and the others.</p>

  <p>It had to be said that the exiles from these small races were too weak.</p>

  <p>Even though they relied on the means of the Warden race, they were still far from capable enough to fight against Emily and the others.</p>

  <p>"Spark, what should we do now?" asked one of the exiles.</p>

  <p>Other than the exiles from the Yellow Emperor race, the exiles from the small races were all depressed.</p>

  <p>They had wanted to use their own strength to make those big races stay in this world, but only when they had actually faced the big races had they understood how weak they were. The gap between their strengths was so big that they were unable to make up for it.</p>

  <p>"It's almost done," said Spark flatly.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the exiles cluelessly looked at one another; they didn't know what Spark meant.</p>

  <p>As Spark turned around and looked at the central area of the high platforms, a black jade pendant appeared in his hand. With a slight pinch of his fingers, he broke the jade pendant into pieces.</p>

  <p>When the jade pendant broke, a disc with a diameter of more than ten thousand feet appeared thousands of miles away from this place.</p>

  <p>And on the disc stood hundreds of people in black cloaks.</p>

  <p>In the center of this disc was an old man with a stoop.</p>

  <p>This old man was so skinny that his face looked like a skull. He was a member of the Warden race and the leader of the conservative faction.</p>

  <p>"Unexpectedly, the two little kids have brought them here anyway..." the old man murmured.</p>

  <p>His voice was as small as an insect's, but it clearly reached everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>"Spark and his companions are good for nothing. They can't stop them at all," commented a purple-haired young man standing beside the old man.</p>

  <p>The old man chuckled. "There is indeed a big gap between them in strength. Ever since Emily found the two survivors, I knew this day would come."</p>

  <p>"Master, should we start the Strength Equalizing token now?" A crisp female voice came from a black cloak.</p>

  <p>The old man gave a long sigh, and something unreadable flashed in his eyes. Then, finally making up his mind, he nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the huge disc under these cloaked people's feet began to slowly spin...</p>
