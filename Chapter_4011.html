<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The path in the Wilderness of No Return was not a straight line but a crooked one extending to the end of the wilderness.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being manipulated Zheng's body and walked slowly.</p>

  <p>Everyone maintained a distance of about dozens of feet from Zheng and followed him closely.</p>

  <p>Dawn turned to dusk, and dusk turned to dawn, but Zheng kept moving forward. He didn't express an intent to stop.</p>

  <p>"How far have we moved?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had been counting the steps since they entered the wilderness. "About four hundred miles," he answered the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Walking over a few hundred miles for dozens of hours took so much of everyone's time.</p>

  <p>"So we have left the Supreme Pure Realm and are about four hundred miles away." Pearson sighed.</p>

  <p>No any scenery surrounded the wilderness. No matter how far they went, everything still looked the same.</p>

  <p>Although they knew they could return any time, a trace of panic lingered deep in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Leaving the Supreme Pure Realm?" "That's right." The leader of the men in black robes nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Although the Supreme Pure Realm was a large area, its extent was limited.</p>

  <p>The Wilderness of No Return surrounding the Supreme Pure Realm obviously didn't belong to it.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where we'll end up if we keep going like this. Squeak," said King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>"The road doesn't go on forever." Eastern Emperor Taiyi shrugged, smiling optimistically.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess suddenly pointed and said, "Everyone, look to the side."</p>

  <p>While everyone's eyes were fixed upfront, the Snake Goddess peripherally saw a black line from the side.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Pearson's eyes glared with curiosity.</p>

  <p>After walking in the wilderness for too long, anything they saw made them cautious.</p>

  <p>"I can't see it."</p>

  <p>"The distance between it and us is too far..."</p>

  <p>"I can't tell."</p>

  <p>Everyone squinted into the distance but the black line was too far to be distinguished. From their view, it looked like a thin black snake lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>"It's a river," the Wing King suddenly said behind the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Can you see it clearly, Wing King? Squeak!" asked King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>"Good eyesight!" Pearson commended.</p>

  <p>They all thought the Wing King's eyesight was the best among them, but he shook his head and said, "Zheng told me."</p>

  <p>Zheng was still communicating with the Wing King through the Civilization Artifact in his inner world. He could also see things through his eyes. His current eyesight far exceeded that of the group behind him.</p>

  <p>"A river in the wilderness? Why is there a river?" the Snake Goddess asked with suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Zheng said it's the Divine River," Wing King continued.</p>

  <p>When they heard this, the look on the crowd's faces changed with ease, but Pearson was lost in thought.</p>

  <p>The place of origin of the Divine River was the Jade Pure Realm. The river flowed through the Supreme Pure Realm and the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>If they went upstream along the Divine River, they would reach the Jade Pure Realm, but no one had ever succeeded in getting to the Jade Pure Stage in this way.</p>

  <p>"If one moves upstream along the Divine River in the Grand Pure Realm, they can reach the central plain of the Grand Pure Realm. That plain should be connected to the wilderness." Pearson suddenly came into conclusion.</p>

  <p>"In other words, the boundless center of the Grand Pure Realm is connected to the extension of the Supreme Pure Realm," the Snake Goddess added.</p>

  <p>Fuxi chuckled. "The person who designed the Three Purities Stage is indeed interesting."</p>

  <p>As they walked, they discovered that the line of the Divine River converged from afar. It became more recognizable as they got closer and closer.</p>

  <p>Splash, splash...</p>

  <p>A sound of waves crashed from the Divine River while golden objects streamed along its waters.</p>

  <p>"They are the Golden Bites," said King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>These Golden Bites could devour anything that appeared along the river.</p>

  <p>"If we can enter the Divine River here, I think we can collect many good items." Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes revealed a look of envy.</p>

  <p>He had stayed in the Divine River for a long time and there was a fierce competition about the river in the Flaming Maple Forest. Now, no one was competing for the items of the Divine River; those who arrived first could take them first.</p>

  <p>"I think you better give up this idea. We're most likely to be dead after we get out of this path," said Yasamin with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi shrugged. "Maybe this path intersects with the Divine River."</p>

  <p>He had gained a lot of benefits from the Divine River and had also given a lot of help to many Holy Soul warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace. He hoped to go into the Divine River and obtain rare Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Just as Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, the Divine River was getting nearer to the path they were walking.</p>

  <p>The shortest distance between the river and the path was only thirty feet.</p>

  <p>While Eastern Emperor Taiyi was filled with expectation, the ground in front of him suddenly bulged.</p>

  <p>Two copper trestles arched out from the ground, forcibly creating an entrance to a cave.</p>

  <p>The material of the trestles was the same as that of the copper Myriad Pagoda Mountains. The passage that the Treacherous Being had opened was this cave.</p>

  <p>"Do the mechanical devices at the bottom of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains extend all the way here?" King Ieuan asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Of course not." Pearson disagreed. "If they did, wouldn't it be easy to find the passages by moving along the mechanical devices underground?"</p>

  <p>"That's right..." King Ieuan nodded.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked to the front of the cave and paused. He suddenly turned his head and opened his mouth wide.</p>

  <p>"It is going to howl again!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi curled his lip and damaged his hearing to protect himself from the loud voice.</p>

  <p>Everyone was deeply afraid of the howls from the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Before the Treacherous Being's wail could be heard, they had already taken action to damage their auditory senses. They deafened their ears in unison.</p>

  <p>After wailing at the entrance of the cave, Zheng quickly went inside.</p>

  <p>The crowd proceeded to follow closely.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the cave was shallow. It took them only a hundred feet to reach its end.</p>

  <p>Many fish hooks hung down at the end of the cave.</p>

  <p>These fish hooks flickered conspicuously with light blue luster amid the darkness.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being was clever. It controlled Zheng's body to jump up and bite one of the fish hooks.</p>

  <p>Zheng hung in the air, twisting while he pulled on the fish hook, like a fish biting onto a bait.</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and those in the cave were puzzled.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a huge force came from above and dragged Zheng to the darkness above the cave.</p>

  <p>It was as if a fisherman had caught a fish...</p>

  <p>"Zheng has been caught!" King Ieuan exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"This cave is only one hundred feet deep. According to the slope, it should be only about ten feet high. Why does the space above seem to be so large?" Fuxi asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"The space rules in the Three Purities Stage are chaotic. Let's follow them and have a look," the Snake Goddess said as she went to observe the fish hooks.</p>

  <p>"Squeak, how do we get up there? Should we do the same as Zheng did?" asked King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>"That's the only way."</p>

  <p>As the Snake Goddess spoke, she jumped up and bit the fish hook that hung down from nowhere.</p>

  <p>Waiting for a few moments after biting the fish hook, the Snake Goddess wasn't dragged upwards at all.</p>

  <p>She could only twist her slender body as Zheng did. She frowned and got morose when she suddenly felt a huge force from her mouth and was instantly dragged up.</p>
