  <p>The killing arrays of the Immortal Mansion had been triggered in a specific order.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had panicked though, and he had left several powerful killing arrays not activated.</p>

  <p>However, the seven-colored long sword and the mighty hammer atop the pavilion's roof had done their job. They'd exterminated most of the vicious beasts in the courtyard, and left only corpses of birds, bugs, and giant apes behind.</p>

  <p>The terrible creatures that had been driven out of the palace were seen circling the walls and searching for a way in. Luo Luo Zheng could tell they wouldn't be leaving anytime soon.</p>

  <p>It was the mammoth, crimson bug that worried Luo Luo Zheng the most though. It stared at him with unblinking, blood red eyes. A hiss slipped from its pincers making him shiver in disgust. It seemed as if it were trying to speak to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling crawled up Luo Zheng's spine and made his heart stutter in fear. The voice that echoed in his mind was high pitched and grating.</p>

  <p>It wasn't like he could understand the hissing sounds, but he was able to understand the impression and meaning of the words. Such a unique form of communication.</p>

  <p>"Release the item from underground," the bug hissed. "We will allow you to leave the Swirl Forest without causing you any difficulty. We will even gift you with three precious fruits. It is a very generous deal."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face was scrunched, expressing just how uncomfortable receiving the message had been.</p>

  <p>Saul, who was standing nearby, barked out a cold laugh when he noticed Luo Zheng's face. "It's best to ignore the creature. It must want to release the thing under the palace. Humph, these damned monsters will never give up."</p>

  <p>"What is buried underneath the Immortal Mansion, exactly?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, curious.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Luo Luo Zheng had discovered that many of the restrictions and killing arrays in this place were targeted at something hidden underneath the Immortal Mansion. The beasts outside the palace were as strong as True Gods, and they must have been clawing their way through to reach this level.</p>

  <p>Their need was so strong that they were risking their lives to steal what was under the palace. Whatever was down below was incredibly important Luo Luo Zheng was sure.</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, Saul shook his head and said, "It benefits you not to know that now. This thing can affect the rankings of the Floating Islands in the Time Sea. When the time comes, you'll be told. For now, though, let us drive these foul beasts away."</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had been presented with this before now, he would have exploded with hundreds of questions.</p>

  <p>After experiencing everything he had though, Luo Luo Zheng was able to hold himself back. He understood that it might not be prudent for him to know at this time, and he just needed to simply focus on the task at hand. If he knew what was under the palace, it could cause unneeded worries and distractions.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng met the gaze of the crimson beast and shook his head. "I refuse."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not shout or use his chaotic energy, instead he had spoken calmly and in a soft voice. That didn't seem to hinder the bug from understanding what he said; however, it glared at him in stony silence. A short moment later the shell on its back split open, and it spread its wings to fly away. Countless giant gray bugs followed suit and flew after it.</p>

  <p>"Caaawww!"</p>

  <p>The piercing screech made Luo Luo Zheng flinch. "Woo-oo-oo!"</p>

  <p>The giant apes hollered and howled, echoing the black birds' cries. Then, in an instant, they were gone, following after the crimson bug, and taking their harrowing cries with them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let out the breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.</p>

  <p>It might seem like just a forest in the divine land, but there were such powerful creatures lurking within. There were so many of them that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't realized they were there.</p>

  <p>'Of course, it is as father had told me, my path through the divine land would only grow more and more difficult, ' thought Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't been able to understand why his father, as a Holy Being, would create so many obstacles for him. Even going so far as to put him through countless deadly experiences. Only now did Luo Luo Zheng understand why.</p>

  <p>In the universe, Luo Xiao could absolutely help Luo Luo Zheng make great strides towards his goal. Luo Xiao would also be able to make the path much easier for him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Xiao couldn't protect him forever. After arriving in the divine land, Luo Luo Zheng had only himself to rely on. If he hadn't put Luo Luo Zheng through such grueling experiences, it would have been near impossible for him to survive the divine land with such a childish, brutish mentality.</p>

  <p>If he really considered everything from this point of view, Luo Xiao thought things through carefully.</p>

  <p>"Why is this bubble enchanted barrier unable to be activated again?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could feel the barrier within his mind, and was able to tell it was unstable in its current state.</p>

  <p>"The bubble enchanted barrier isolates a part of space in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Naturally it cannot be opened and closed casually as if it were a normal enchanted barrier," Saul explained. "Back then." he continued, explaining Bromley's skill, "It was already a huge feat for my master to create this enchanted barrier."</p>

  <p>This bubble enchanted barrier was able to prevent secondary creatures from disintegrating. Having it here was equal to erasing fundamental rules of the divine land to a certain degree, though. It might be limited to just within the Immortal Mansion, but it was precious to the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head in understanding. He intended to bring his family into the Immortal Mansion, so if he helped restore the bubble enchanted barrier, it would be great.</p>

  <p>He himself was at no risk, but if his loved ones entered and then were to disappear in front of him, Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what he'd do. It would be a tragedy.</p>

  <p>A terrible thought crossed Luo Zheng's mind. If the Immortal Mansion's bubble enchanted barrier was forced to shatter at some point, what would happen to those inside? Wouldn't it be extremely dangerous for Ning Yudie and the others to be inside?</p>

  <p>With this worry at the forefront of his mind, Luo Luo Zheng decided that sending his family to the Immortal Mansion would probably be a foolish decision.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned to Saul to express his concern.</p>

  <p>Saul only smiled. "You are overthinking things. No one has broken through the barrier in many years. When this palace was created by your master it was done in the Swirl Forest, so naturally, he had planned for such a thing. If that were to ever happen though, there is always the training tower to take refuge in." Besides, he truly wanted someone to stay at the palace with him. Especially Luo Nian, that boy always brought fun to him and Immortal Book.</p>

  <p>Afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would decide to leave Luo Nian and the others in the universe, Saul continued, "The Evolutionary Universe has been invaded by the race from the Murphy Universe. Murphy might not let it go. He might have other means to destroy the universe. Leaving your family there could be dangerous."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a little comfort at Saul's words. There was no true safe place in the world anymore, and even the Holy Beings could not protect all the people they wanted to. Not to mention, Luo Zheng's current strength was far from what he wanted to achieve. He had to do his best to protect them, and the Immortal Mansion seemed the most promising place at the moment. It would be near impossible to surpass its power unless one was on the same level as the blue-clothed woman. Now, whether or not that woman could also defend herself against the various arrays was another matter entirely.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for Luo Luo Zheng to make a decision, and he returned to the Evolutionary Universe from the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stayed in the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place for a long while before he was ready to send Ning Yudie, Luo Nian, and others to the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning knew Luo Luo Zheng was planning to enter the divine land soon, so she wanted to enter the Immortal Mansion. She also knew that Luo Luo Zheng was able to come and go as he pleased from the Immortal Mansion. Mu Ning wanted to be there to see him whenever he returned.</p>

  <p>Her request to leave was turned down by Wynn, though. Mu Ning, just like all of the Godly Geniuses, represented the hope that Luo Xiao had planted. Although the hope was not great, it represented an infinite number of possibilities. Wynn couldn't allow Mu Ning to go gallivanting wherever she pleased. Not when he needed her here to continue cultivating. He hoped one day she would have the chance to become a True God.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had heartily agreed with Wynn's decision, and it only served to make Mu Ning angry. It took a long time for Luo Luo Zheng to calm Mu Ning and convince her that staying with Wynn would be the best option. Because of this it had taken him much longer to prepare than he had planned.</p>

  <p>A month and a half had passed by the time Luo Luo Zheng settled everything, and went to find Wynn.</p>

  <p>Since Wynn's body had been destroyed, he could no longer move freely in the universe. Master Feng had to lead Luo Luo Zheng through the universe to reach a northern supreme world of the Evolutionary Universe. It happened to be the Gem Jade World.</p>

  <p>There was a small, nameless race occupying this supreme world. It was so minuscule, and it only had three world lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Wynn kept their arrival a secret from the small race. Once they entered the Gem Jade World, under Wynn's careful instruction, Master Feng directed Luo Luo Zheng to continue north. He would continue north until he reached the northernmost tip of the Evolutionary Universe, and arrived at the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>When Master Feng stopped, Luo Luo Zheng asked, "Did Tianming also sneak in from this place?"</p>

  <p>Wynn shook his head and answered, "No. He did not follow the same route as you."</p>

  <p>When they were all quiet again, Wynn stepped up to the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>Placing his hand on the wall, a red light started to emanate from Wynn's palm. They watched as the pulsing red light crept out along the wall, and the section of brick seemed to melt away to form a tunnel.</p>

  <p>Along the tunnel walls and ceiling, blue veined patterns crisscrossed and spiraled down the path. There wasn't the slightest fluctuation of the Space Law, and they knew this was the correct path to the divine land.</p>
