<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2114 Path To The Divine Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The killing arrays of the fairy palace had been triggered in a specific order.</p>

  <p>Zheng had panicked though, and he had left several powerful killing arrays not activated.</p>

  <p>However, the seven-colored long sword and the mighty hammer atop the pavilion's roof had done their job. They'd exterminated most of the vicious beasts in the courtyard, and left only corpses of birds, bugs, and giant apes behind.</p>

  <p>The terrible creatures that had been driven out of the palace were seen circling the walls and searching for a way in. Zheng could tell they wouldn't be leaving anytime soon.</p>

  <p>It was the mammoth, crimson bug that worried Zheng the most though. It stared at him with unblinking, blood red eyes. A hiss slipped from its pincers making him shiver in disgust. It seemed as if it were trying to speak to Zheng.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling crawled up Zheng's spine and made his heart stutter in fear. The voice that echoed in his mind was high pitched and grating.</p>

  <p>It wasn't like he could understand the hissing sounds, but he was able to understand the impression and meaning of the words. Such a unique form of communication.</p>

  <p>"Release the item from underground," the bug hissed. "We will allow you to leave the Swirl Forest without causing you any difficulty. We will even gift you with three precious fruits. It is a very generous deal."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was scrunched, expressing just how uncomfortable receiving the message had been.</p>

  <p>Saul, who was standing nearby, barked out a cold laugh when he noticed Zheng's face. "It's best to ignore the creature. It must want to release the thing under the palace. Humph, these damned monsters will never give up."</p>

  <p>"What is buried underneath the fairy palace, exactly?" Zheng asked, curious.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Zheng had discovered that many of the restrictions and killing arrays in this place were targeted at something hidden underneath the fairy palace. The beasts outside the palace were as strong as True Gods, and they must have been clawing their way through to reach this level.</p>

  <p>Their need was so strong that they were risking their lives to steal what was under the palace. Whatever was down below was incredibly important Zheng was sure.</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, Saul shook his head and said, "It benefits you not to know that now. This thing can affect the rankings of the Floating Islands in the Time Sea. When the time comes, you'll be told. For now, though, let us drive these foul beasts away."</p>

  <p>If Zheng had been presented with this before now, he would have exploded with hundreds of questions.</p>

  <p>After experiencing everything he had though, Zheng was able to hold himself back. He understood that it might not be prudent for him to know at this time, and he just needed to simply focus on the task at hand. If he knew what was under the palace, it could cause unneeded worries and distractions.</p>

  <p>Zheng met the gaze of the crimson beast and shook his head. "I refuse."</p>

  <p>Zheng did not shout or use his chaotic energy, instead he had spoken calmly and in a soft voice. That didn't seem to hinder the bug from understanding what he said; however, it glared at him in stony silence. A short moment later the shell on its back split open, and it spread its wings to fly away. Countless giant gray bugs followed suit and flew after it.</p>

  <p>"Caaawww!"</p>

  <p>The piercing screech made Zheng flinch. "Woo-oo-oo!"</p>

  <p>The giant apes hollered and howled, echoing the black birds' cries. Then, in an instant, they were gone, following after the crimson bug, and taking their harrowing cries with them.</p>

  <p>Zheng let out the breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.</p>

  <p>It might seem like just a forest in the divine land, but there were such powerful creatures lurking within. There were so many of them that Zheng hadn't realized they were there.</p>

  <p>'Of course, it is as father had told me, my path through the divine land would only grow more and more difficult, ' thought Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't been able to understand why his father, as a Holy Being, would create so many obstacles for him. Even going so far as to put him through countless deadly experiences. Only now did Zheng understand why.</p>

  <p>In the universe, Mike could absolutely help Zheng make great strides towards his goal. Mike would also be able to make the path much easier for him.</p>

  <p>However, Mike couldn't protect him forever. After arriving in the divine land, Zheng had only himself to rely on. If he hadn't put Zheng through such grueling experiences, it would have been near impossible for him to survive the divine land with such a childish, brutish mentality.</p>

  <p>If he really considered everything from this point of view, Mike thought things through carefully.</p>

  <p>"Why is this bubble enchanted barrier unable to be activated again?"</p>

  <p>Zheng could feel the barrier within his mind, and was able to tell it was unstable in its current state.</p>

  <p>"The bubble enchanted barrier isolates a part of space in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Naturally it cannot be opened and closed casually as if it were a normal enchanted barrier," Saul explained. "Back then." he continued, explaining Bromley's skill, "It was already a huge feat for my master to create this enchanted barrier."</p>

  <p>This bubble enchanted barrier was able to prevent secondary creatures from disintegrating. Having it here was equal to erasing fundamental rules of the divine land to a certain degree, though. It might be limited to just within the fairy palace, but it was precious to the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head in understanding. He intended to bring his family into the fairy palace, so if he helped restore the bubble enchanted barrier, it would be great.</p>

  <p>He himself was at no risk, but if his loved ones entered and then were to disappear in front of him, Zheng didn't know what he'd do. It would be a tragedy.</p>

  <p>A terrible thought crossed Zheng's mind. If the fairy palace's bubble enchanted barrier was forced to shatter at some point, what would happen to those inside? Wouldn't it be extremely dangerous for Yudie and the others to be inside?</p>

  <p>With this worry at the forefront of his mind, Zheng decided that sending his family to the fairy palace would probably be a foolish decision.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to Saul to express his concern.</p>

  <p>Saul only smiled. "You are overthinking things. No one has broken through the barrier in many years. When this palace was created by your master it was done in the Swirl Forest, so naturally, he had planned for such a thing. If that were to ever happen though, there is always the training tower to take refuge in." Besides, he truly wanted someone to stay at the palace with him. Especially Geoffrey, that boy always brought fun to him and Immortal Book.</p>

  <p>Afraid that Zheng would decide to leave Geoffrey and the others in the universe, Saul continued, "The Evolutionary Universe has been invaded by the race from the Murphy Universe. Murphy might not let it go. He might have other means to destroy the universe. Leaving your family there could be dangerous."</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a little comfort at Saul's words. There was no true safe place in the world anymore, and even the Holy Beings could not protect all the people they wanted to. Not to mention, Zheng's current strength was far from what he wanted to achieve. He had to do his best to protect them, and the fairy palace seemed the most promising place at the moment. It would be near impossible to surpass its power unless one was on the same level as the blue-clothed woman. Now, whether or not that woman could also defend herself against the various arrays was another matter entirely.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for Zheng to make a decision, and he returned to the Evolutionary Universe from the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Zheng stayed in the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place for a long while before he was ready to send Yudie, Geoffrey, and others to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Margaret knew Zheng was planning to enter the divine land soon, so she wanted to enter the fairy palace. She also knew that Zheng was able to come and go as he pleased from the fairy palace. Margaret wanted to be there to see him whenever he returned.</p>

  <p>Her request to leave was turned down by Wynn, though. Margaret, just like all of the Godly Geniuses, represented the hope that Mike had planted. Although the hope was not great, it represented an infinite number of possibilities. Wynn couldn't allow Margaret to go gallivanting wherever she pleased. Not when he needed her here to continue cultivating. He hoped one day she would have the chance to become a True God.</p>

  <p>Zheng had heartily agreed with Wynn's decision, and it only served to make Margaret angry. It took a long time for Zheng to calm Margaret and convince her that staying with Wynn would be the best option. Because of this it had taken him much longer to prepare than he had planned.</p>

  <p>A month and a half had passed by the time Zheng settled everything, and went to find Wynn.</p>

  <p>Since Wynn's body had been destroyed, he could no longer move freely in the universe. Master Feng had to lead Zheng through the universe to reach a northern supreme world of the Evolutionary Universe. It happened to be the Gem Jade World.</p>

  <p>There was a small, nameless race occupying this supreme world. It was so minuscule, and it only had three world lords.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Wynn kept their arrival a secret from the small race. Once they entered the Gem Jade World, under Wynn's careful instruction, Master Feng directed Zheng to continue north. He would continue north until he reached the northernmost tip of the Evolutionary Universe, and arrived at the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>When Master Feng stopped, Zheng asked, "Did Tianming also sneak in from this place?"</p>

  <p>Wynn shook his head and answered, "No. He did not follow the same route as you."</p>

  <p>When they were all quiet again, Wynn stepped up to the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>Placing his hand on the wall, a red light started to emanate from Wynn's palm. They watched as the pulsing red light crept out along the wall, and the section of brick seemed to melt away to form a tunnel.</p>

  <p>Along the tunnel walls and ceiling, blue veined patterns crisscrossed and spiraled down the path. There wasn't the slightest fluctuation of the Space Law, and they knew this was the correct path to the divine land.</p>
