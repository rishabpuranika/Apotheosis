<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3451 Devil Soul-sucking Spear </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In his shock, the Evil God was about to move away.</p>

  <p>Just as Mount said, the surrounding space remained stationary as though the Space Law had no effect on it.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes flashed with the killing intent? he did not waste any time attacking Mount with all his strength.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess' countless shadows formed energy beams that rushed straight toward Mount.</p>

  <p>But before they touched him, he managed to turn himself into a shadow and disappear before the Evil God's eyes.</p>

  <p>With Mount's current strength, it was a little difficult to make use of the Hypercube Imprisonment? it was stronger than the cube in which Yan was imprisoned earlier, but it took some time to employ it.</p>

  <p>To pave the way for the prison, he peeled off the space fragments. It was unrealistic to use those fragments to kill the Evil God.</p>

  <p>After taking the Evil God's first round of attack, Mount finally had a chance to fight back.</p>

  <p>Buzz?</p>

  <p>After Mount used the spatial transference, he appeared on the other side.</p>

  <p>Only a hundred feet away from the Evil God, Mount stared him down indifferently.</p>

  <p>Now that he was imprisoned, the Evil God's face was twisted. He tried throwing a punch at his captor.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The power from the punch was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>But his fist met a transparent wall.</p>

  <p>The energy beams stored within the shadows of Snake Goddess were scattered, forming an intense whirlpool of energy. It bounced back against the wall and surged everywhere. No energy could spread out from the cube.</p>

  <p>As it circulated, it outlined the entire cube.</p>

  <p>A red ferocity filled the Evil God's eyes as he continued punching the barrier to no avail. The rampant energy scraped against his body but the cube remained motionless.</p>

  <p>Mount's expression was steady-calm as he looked at the Evil God. His eyes were on the latter like he was merely watching a performance from a distance.</p>

  <p>The scene made the other races sigh in relief.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits remained their goal? no one wanted to face the sudden appearance of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Locking up the monster was beneficial.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse race and the Separate Abyss race, in particular, could then pay more attention to the mother.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can do anything you want, now that you've trapped me?" the Evil God asked with his menacing tone after he calmed down.</p>

  <p>A hint of black light shone in his eyes and the black energy of the world began to flow, forming numerous four-legged black snakes.</p>

  <p>When the powerful warriors of the Separate Abyss race witnessed the four-legged black snakes, the corners of their eyes twitched unconsciously.</p>

  <p>These few had escaped the Evil God once and lived to tell the tale, but the four-legged black snakes frightened them, covering them in a great shadow.</p>

  <p>Mount looked up to examine the snakes before shaking his head. "Of course not. Only when you die will everything go back to normal."</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can kill me?" The Evil God's eyes narrowed as he asked maliciously.</p>

  <p>"I can't kill you now," Mount said, flicking the golden abacus with his hand.</p>

  <p>It flew away easily before quickly returning to its spot. Before the golden abacus disappeared, Mount couldn't use any Other Shore Power. After another pause, Mount continued, "But he can."</p>

  <p>As Mount subtly hooked his finger, the outline of another space appeared beside him. It contained a young man holding a long spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>Though he seemed somewhat dispirited, his eyes were still sharp.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Khalid, who had just taken a beating from Yan.</p>

  <p>The man was the top warrior from the Bearing race's younger generation.</p>

  <p>His strength wasn't to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>In a head-on fight, he was no weaker than Yan.</p>

  <p>But he was known to be impetuous and self-gratified. In the most crucial moments, it was often difficult to bring his full strength into play.</p>

  <p>Failing to be cautious enough, he suffered a great loss.</p>

  <p>Trapped in the Hypercube Imprisonment, the Evil God couldn't dodge effectively. With Mount's help, Khalid could use his strength to its fullest.</p>

  <p>"Refine!"</p>

  <p>Spitting out a mouthful of blood, Khalid lifted the spear carefully.</p>

  <p>The bear's shadow gradually emerged from behind him.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As he shook the spear, the power at its tip began flowing like a flame.</p>

  <p>At first glance, Khalid and the weapon looked as though they were integrated into a whole? Khalid's body as the secondary part, and the spear as the core.</p>

  <p>But after Khalid's motion, he spoke, "Gee... I feel bad that Mount sent Luo Zheng away. I heard you were born in his inner world. It's hard to believe that he's dead and you're still alive. Let me help you end your life! I'm just..."</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap," Mount interjected coldly. "Let's get this over with!"</p>

  <p>After dealing with the Evil God, Mount had to face the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Li Shan mountain. While Khalid was indeed very strong, he wasn't particularly wise. His words were nonsensical and meaningless, apart from provoking the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>After Mount's chastising, Khalid finally calmed down enough to get serious.</p>

  <p>Tiny skulls popped out around the spear. After the skulls laughed strangely, Khalid's thin, frail body began swelling. Before long, he turned into a plump and chubby boy.</p>

  <p>In the cube, the Evil God stood still. All previous signs of arrogance were replaced by a serious expression.</p>

  <p>The black energy in the world continuously formed four-legged black snakes that gathered rapidly from all directions.</p>

  <p>"Devil Soul-sucking Spear!"</p>

  <p>Gripping the long spear in one hand, Khalid took a step in the air, using the weapon to stab at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Those who could take the spear as a weapon were no less powerful than dragons. They held great intention to kill their enemies in a single strike.</p>

  <p>Khalid's Other Shore Token was a skull called the 'Heavenly Fiend Skull'.</p>

  <p>At all times, it was stored in the Heavenly Fiend Temple situated within Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Fiend Temple was an extremely powerful one, and no one even knew how many creatures had died there.</p>

  <p>Every creature to perish there was absorbed by the Heavenly Fiend Skull.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race had paid a hefty price to get their hands on the token. In the end, it fell into Khalid's hands.</p>

  <p>Khalid's blow nearly exhausted all its power, and his physical body had also reached its limit.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The moment the tip of the spear cut through air, countless shadows of skulls in the surging spear radiance began whining.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the black snakes continued flying over. They turned into figures of the Evil God, standing in a row as defense against the spear radiance.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop..."</p>

  <p>How could they resist Khalid's attack?</p>

  <p>The very moment the spear radiance pierced these figures, they exploded.</p>

  <p>But the black energy didn't disappear. Like a bunch of maggots, it continued gnawing at the spear radiance.</p>

  <p>As the spear radiance penetrated the Evil God's figures, the bright white spear radiance grew dark, and even the spear's sharp tip was contaminated.</p>
