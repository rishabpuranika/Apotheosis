  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the same time, the divine textures began to emit a faint halo of light, as if some mysterious power was wakening up. The halo was revolving around the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>And then, something incredible happened! The entire mountain itself shook and slowly rose up from the sea!</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain, in appearance, was not so different from an ordinary mountain; it was about ten thousand feet tall and proportionately wide. However, it was definitely a lot heavier than an ordinary mountain. The latter was made of commonplace rocks, while the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was made of magnetic stones.</p>

  <p>These magnetic stones were tough, and slightly heavier than common rocks. They contained the power of five different elements, which prevented any type of law from invading them. That was the reason why the mountain could not be destroyed by knives or swords. There were other mountains in this world too. Some were the type which contained a lot of rich and pure iron ore. In fact, they might have been much heavier than the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. However, they were useless to Zheng and he wasn't going to refine them.</p>

  <p>As Zheng continued to ascend, the part of the mountain which had been immersed in the sea gradually rose up towards the surface. Finally, the entire mountain left the sea level and floated in the air.</p>

  <p>Some living beings that had gathered on the mountain left their nests and jumped into the sea, startled by the sudden change in atmosphere.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's finger gently flicked and dozens of drops of blood left his body.</p>

  <p>"Blood Refinement Technique!"</p>

  <p>To take ownership of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, not only did Zheng need to set up the six-star divine textures, but there was also a more important part: the Blood Refinement Technique which was recorded in the "Myriad Manifestations of Nature".</p>

  <p>After the drops of blood had flowed out of Zheng's body, they slowly rotated and revolved around in the air. Under the circulation of the Blood Refinement Technique, they then began to merge with one another and quickly formed a palm-sized, blood-refined rune.</p>

  <p>The blood-refined rune continued to spin around and began to descend towards the gigantic mountain underneath it.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain was enhanced by the power of five elements, so it was hard to collect it because no matter which type of law was used, it wouldn't be able to react completely with the mountain.</p>

  <p>However, the Blood Refinement Technique had a miraculous effect in refining the mountain.</p>

  <p>It was because of this reason that Zheng had begun to admire his master more and more. However, he didn't know whether or not the various secret techniques within the "Myriad Manifestations of Nature" were all created by his master. Maybe his master had collected them while he was travelling.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's blood-refined rune hit the mountain, the mountain began to shake at a much faster speed. Finally, it began to rotate at a pace which was comparable to that of the drops of blood and the blood-refined rune.</p>

  <p>Whir! Whir! Whir!</p>

  <p>The mountain was huge and the momentum was remarkable. Its spinning caused the wind to be torn apart and the whirring sound was heard for miles apart. From time to time, some light-cyan wind blades would hit the mountain and emit a muffled sound.</p>

  <p>As soon as the blood-refined rune had come into being, a connection was established between it and Zheng. However, the rune had been formed from the blood within his body, so the connection was extremely weak. As a result, Zheng couldn't control the mountain at all.</p>

  <p>But that wasn't a cause for worry. The thirty three divine textures surrounding the mountain were there for a purpose. They suddenly erupted a resplendent light.</p>

  <p>The power contained within each of these thirty three divine textures was different. Zheng had spent quite a bit of time and effort in crafting them since they were six star ones. Sometimes, he even had to discuss it with the cyan dragon and ask him for help. According to the cyan dragon, the purpose of these thirty three divine textures was to temporarily suppress the power of the five elements within the mountain. That was the only way in which, the blood-refined rune would be able to completely immerse itself within the mountain.</p>

  <p>And now, whatever was happening was just as the cyan dragon had said.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain, which originally had several colors revolving within it, was now changing. As the thirty three divine textures showed their effects, the five elements within the mountain suddenly stopped flowing.</p>

  <p>The numerous colors of the mountain morphed themselves into a pale yellow shade.</p>

  <p>"The power of the five elements has disappeared, right?" Zheng mumbled.</p>

  <p>He also could feel that the laws within the mountain had disappeared now. There were still traces of the Earth Law in it, which meant that by now, the mountain had turned into an ordinary earth mountain.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>As a few light cyan wind blades hit the mountain, they immediately caused several deep dents on it. Previously, these wind blades that contained only the second layer of the Wind Law were unable to cause any substantial damage to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. In fact, even if they had been black colored wind blades, they would have hardly left a few small marks on it.</p>

  <p>But the mountain had transformed for the time being. If Zheng had not suppressed the power of the five elements in this way, it would simply have been wishful thinking to subdue the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Whoever thought up of this method to suppress the power within the mountain was clearly a precocious genius." The cyan dragon was watching the scene from Zheng's mind and marveled at the technique.</p>

  <p>"All right then. The power of the five elements of the mountain is suppressed now. Refine it!" In that instant, several mysterious seals appeared in Zheng's hand. Meanwhile, the blood-refined rune which was originally lying on the surface of the mountain was now sinking into its interior.</p>

  <p>"Draw a six-sided world with the space boundary. Collect the mountain!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, six of the thirty three six-star divine textures erupted an intense power of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Under their action, the power of the Space Law instantly spread out and formed a six-sided world, encompassing the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>This was actually a Sumeru Space, and the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was inside it. Things were beginning to look much more interesting now!</p>

  <p>As the Sumeru Space gradually stabilized, the six-sided world began to shrink rapidly, forcing the mountain to also become smaller and smaller.</p>

  <p>The decrease in size caused a change in speed, as required by the laws which governed motion of bodies. The spin became faster and faster. The mountain which was about ten thousand feet tall eventually turned into a small palm-sized object right in front of Zheng's eyes. It kept spinning, its surface still earthy yellow.</p>

  <p>After suppressing the power of the five elements, it was going to take some time for the mountain to recover, so Zheng left it alone. Once the six-star divine textures' energy ran out, the Magnetic Sacred Mountain would return to its original state.</p>

  <p>As he held the continuously spinning mini hill in his hand, Zheng had a satisfied smile on his face. Right now, the power of the five elements was suppressed, and the mountain was useless. A single punch from a Life and Death Realm powerhouse would destroy it easily.</p>

  <p>What Zheng was marveling at was that such a method to suppress the power of the five elements wasn't something an ordinary person could come up with, and was only recorded in the "Myriad Manifestations of Nature". The cyan dragon had expressed amazement at the idea because even he felt that it was really ingenious to use thirty three six-star divine textures to dissolve the power of the five elements and transform it into pure Earth Law.</p>

  <p>As far as the cyan dragon knew, many sacred places in the Upper World had set up their sect-protecting arrays with the power of the five elements inside them. This was because the five elements together didn't have an absolute weakness. Thus, not only could these thirty three divine textures be used to destroy the power of the five elements of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, even the most powerful sect-protecting arrays would become as fragile as an eggshell if they were attacked in this way.</p>

  <p>However, the Magnetic Sacred Mountain would be strong again once it recovered its power of the five elements. And that was when it would come in handy. At that time, Soul Sea Realm powerhouses could do nothing to the mountain, and even Spirit Supreme Realm martial artists could only sigh in helplessness if they encountered this mountain. If they wanted to break it by force, they would probably need five or even seven layers of Law Power. However, there weren't too many supreme warriors with such Law Power in the Upper World, so the mountain would definitely be a great support for Zheng in his future endeavors.</p>

  <p>Zheng had obtained the Magnetic Sacred Mountain now and his goal had been achieved. However, just as he was collecting the mountain, his heart suddenly skipped a beat as an extremely uncomfortable feeling arose within his heart. His sixth sense was telling him something!</p>

  <p>"It seems like someone is spying on me." Zheng's brow creased as he swept his gaze across the area, spreading out his senses at the same time.</p>

  <p>The wind blades swept and the waves churned, but there was nothing else in the world. Not a single living soul. As for those living beings in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, Zheng had made them suffer bitterly, so they had hidden deep and wouldn't dare to show up.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not find any living creature spying on him, but the wariness in his heart grew even stronger by the minute.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, a crack suddenly appeared in the space not far behind him. In fact, it looked like the very fabric of space had been cut open by someone. In that hole, it was pitch-black. It looked like the reverse side of the world where even sunlight couldn't reach. At the same time, a long black hook shot out of it and rushed straight towards Zheng.</p>
