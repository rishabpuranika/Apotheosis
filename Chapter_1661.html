</p>

  <p>Margaret no longer hesitated at this moment.</p>

  <p>She was already very proficient at the Purple River Sword Array.</p>

  <p>At the third stage of the array, which was called the 'Meteor Shower Array, ' she ordered her seven flying swords to make a joint attack on her enemy.</p>

  <p>Four years ago, her master had told her that the power of the Meteor Shower Array would allow her to fight most ace talents from large races.</p>

  <p>"Master, what is an ace talent?" she had asked her master back then.</p>

  <p>"They are the elite warriors with the greatest potential from the large races."</p>

  <p>"Are they even stronger than Zheng?"</p>

  <p>To that, her master had only rolled her eyes and hadn't said anything in reply.</p>

  <p>According to the Celestial Position's estimation of Zheng's talent, Zheng did have the potential to become an ace talent, but whether he could defeat the other geniuses still remained uncertain.</p>

  <p>As for Margaret, she had already been able to fight against an ace talent four years ago by virtue of the Purple River Sword Array. Now, she was even stronger after mastering the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that she didn't care about martial arts at all.</p>

  <p>She had neither realized nor appreciated her great potential and strength.</p>

  <p>But there was one thing she understood at this moment.</p>

  <p>She either had to choose to avoid the battle or to end it quickly.</p>

  <p>Of course, she had no way of escaping from a battle on the Heaven Earth Board, so she decided to kill her opponent as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>It was a pathetic result for Ulysses from the Saya race. He didn't even have the chance to unleash his full strength before he was trapped and killed by Margaret's Purple River Sword Array— not that it mattered, of course, considering the large gap between their true strengths.</p>

  <p>Even if Ulysses were to use his most powerful skill, it would only be a small obstacle for Margaret.</p>

  <p>The battle between Margaret and Ulysses was the opening match of the third stage and thus had attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this battle was far from exciting.</p>

  <p>Margaret's negative attitude at the very beginning had taken many people by surprise. But all of a sudden, she turned the tables after revealing her surprising strength and defeated the ace talent from the Saya race quite easily.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng hadn't been able to understand what was going on in Margaret's mind, let alone the rest of the audience who didn't know her well.</p>

  <p>In fact, Elder Apeiron might be the only one who could have understood the girl's strange actions and know her reasons for behaving the way she did.</p>

  <p>Of course, to the Saya race, this result was like a slap on the face. They had never expected that this delicate human girl, who had been dodging attacks all over the place in the beginning, would defeat Ulysses so easily.</p>

  <p>The Saya people stood silently under their huge totem. Even the light emitted by their totem had dimmed a bit. Theoretically, their ancestors' souls had already turned into a kind of will and had been observing their descendants, so they could feel the low spirits of their young members.</p>

  <p>After a while, a new white stone appeared in the sky, and Ulysses, who had been defeated a few moments ago, reappeared on it.</p>

  <p>According to the rules that the mysterious woman had announced previously, no warrior would be eliminated in this stage. They would all keep being revived and be randomly selected to fight against one another. This meant that Ulysses might still have a second chance to prove himself.</p>

  <p>Margaret's figure also disappeared from the original black stone and reappeared on a new one. Controlling the stone, Margaret slowly floated back to Zheng's side. Thus, one black stone and one white stone remained on the board.</p>

  <p>"What powerful means you used! Margaret, I didn't know that you've become such a strong warrior!" Zheng praised with a smile when she came back to his side. With his current knowledge, he was well aware of how powerful the Purple River Sword Array was. He had even started to wonder why there was such a great inheritance in the seemingly tiny Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Margaret was slightly stunned by his praise, but then a sweet smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng had rarely approved of her, so she was glad to see the change in his attitude toward her. She slightly raised her nose and said with a proud smile, "Wait till you see my full strength!"</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Zheng was a bit surprised. "What is your trump card?"</p>

  <p>She grinned cheekily and said, "You will find out later!"</p>

  <p>After the first two stones were arranged on the board, the mysterious woman announced in an indifferent tone, "The winner of the first round is Margaret Xi from the Purple Power World."</p>

  <p>After that, a huge hand appeared from the sky once again and grabbed a white stone. The person standing on it was an ogre ace talent. Next, the hand grabbed a black stone with a human ace talent from the Humanity Alliance on it.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't met this human warrior before, when he was in the Mist Palace. This ace talent was the descendant of Supreme Lord Illusion and hadn't cultivated in the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>This battle turned out to be far more exciting than the first one.</p>

  <p>The two ace talents were evenly matched and both of them exhausted their strengths. As they fought, they dashed from one corner of the board to the other. Cracks appeared on the Heaven Earth Board because of their intense battle but soon disappeared, having been automatically repaired.</p>

  <p>In the end, the winner was the ogre ace talent.</p>

  <p>These 300 warriors came from many different races, and it was really hard to say which party would win in every battle.</p>

  <p>The warriors from the three greatest human forces remained calm and composed. The result of a battle didn't necessarily mean that one race was inferior to the other.</p>

  <p>However, after the ogre ace talent had defeated his human opponent, he began to laugh arrogantly and said, "The humans think of themselves as the leaders of the universe, but they are actually a group of weak cowards. They are nothing to be afraid of!"</p>

  <p>The truth was, the rise of the human race was a fact that was widely accepted by the universe.</p>

  <p>Not a single race, including the ogres and the Demon Night, was able to fight against the human race.</p>

  <p>However, the three greatest forces of the human race were at odds with each other and had formed a situation of mutual restraint. If these three forces could put aside their prejudices and form an alliance, there would be no room for the other races to develop and compete with them.</p>

  <p>So naturally, this ogre ace talent's mockery didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>Human elites like Nathan, Lawson, and a few others didn't even blink an eye. As far as they were concerned, this ogre was acting like a clown.</p>

  <p>But the 300 warriors who were present in the Illusion Battlefield weren't the only ones who had heard his words. In the 30, 000 to 40, 000 tenth-grade sacred places of the three greatest human forces, numerous human warriors were watching this scene through the Illusion Spaces. When they heard the ogre's words, they were extremely angered, and most of them called for the human participants to defeat the ogre. Of course, their voices couldn't be heard by the warriors in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, the same ogre warrior was chosen to fight again in the third round. Many people started to question the mysterious woman's method of selection. They became even more confused when they saw her next move. The opponent she selected for the ogre was yet again a human warrior— this time, an ace talent from the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>In the end, this human warrior was also defeated by the ogre.</p>

  <p>After winning twice in a row against human warriors, the ogre warrior grew even more arrogant. He taunted the human race once more before returning to his stone on his high horse.</p>

  <p>This time, his mockery infuriated many of the human participants in the Illusion Battlefield. They all swore in their minds that they would teach this guy a good lesson if they got the chance.</p>

  <p>The battles continued.</p>

  <p>As the black and white stones kept being added to the board in every round, the number of stones left on the board slowly increased.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, still hadn't been chosen to fight.</p>

  <p>When the 22nd round came, the ogre warrior was selected again by the huge hand.</p>

  <p>Interestingly enough, his opponent was once again a human warrior.</p>

  <p>This time, it was Nathan!</p>

  <p>Nathan was the so-called number one Soul Sea Realm warrior in the universe, undoubtedly an important figure in the whole grand era and the famous Godly Genius from the Thoughtless Minds!</p>

  <p>When he stepped onto the stage, all of the human warriors that were watching through the Illusion Space began to jump for joy. They knew how this round would turn out and they could barely contain their excitement. After all, the ogre warrior had it coming.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the atmosphere around the ogre warriors who were watching the battle became tense.</p>

  <p>After all, Nathan's reputation was not only known by the human race.</p>

  <p>Since he was a Godly Genius, he would be able to grasp a Godly Way and had the possibility of becoming a True God!</p>

  <p>There were only a few Godly Geniuses in the entire universe, and Nathan was known to be the strongest one among them. There was no need to mention how famous he was in the universe.</p>

  <p>After the black and white stones were set on the board, Nathan stepped off his stone.</p>

  <p>His face was completely void of emotion as he slowly walked toward the other side of the board at a steady pace.</p>

  <p>As for the ogre warrior who had previously provoked the human race, it was obvious that he knew that Nathan was not an opponent to be trifled with, because his face was filled with caution. He understood that he wouldn't stand a chance against Nathan, but as an ace talent representing all ogres, he wanted to do his best at least.</p>

  <p>It had never crossed his mind that there would be no time at all for him to display his full strength.</p>

  <p>Nathan defeated him with just one hit.</p>
