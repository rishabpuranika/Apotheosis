<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the divine land, any group of Sanskrit words was considered to be of extraordinary value.</p>

  <p>The water of the Lorena River flowed endlessly, having existed in the divine land for years beyond count.</p>

  <p>In the 17th divine era, after tens of thousands of years had passed, heavy rain suddenly fell upon the Bright Mortal Region where the Lorena River was.</p>

  <p>Because of this heavy rain, a section of the Lorena River collapsed.</p>

  <p>An enormous black rock then appeared in the section, seven golden Sanskrit words engraved on its surface.</p>

  <p>And such was the origin of the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River.</p>

  <p>The news got around fast, attracting the attention of many forces in the divine land. Even the powerful clans on the Floating Islands showed strong interest.</p>

  <p>The first force to receive the news was the Bai Clan. They ranked 18th that year and didn't hesitate to make a move.</p>

  <p>Its territory included the Bright Mortal Region.</p>

  <p>Although the Bai Clan ordered a complete news blackout at an impressive speed, copies of the seven Sanskrit words still managed to slip through.</p>

  <p>Many powerful clans had spent a large sum of money purchasing all these copies. In spite of the efforts of the Bai Clan to block the copies from getting leaked, it was already impossible for them to completely eradicate them at that point.</p>

  <p>One copy was enough to replicate a thousand times over, after all.</p>

  <p>The Bai Clan was utterly furious about it, but it was impossible to trace it all back to who made the first copy.</p>

  <p>When the powerful warriors of the divine land got their hands on the copies, they wasted no time and started deciphering the seven Sanskrit words right away. But when they began studying, the True Gods, the consummate True Gods, and the Holy Beings in the divine land discovered the great difficulty in deciphering the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Although some rare Sanskrit words were unusually strange, there was always someone out there who could interpret some of them here and there.</p>

  <p>After being passed on from generation to generation, the True Gods' understanding of the Sanskrit words was slowly growing.</p>

  <p>But the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River were simply too complicated in comparison to ordinary Sanskrit words. Warriors could barely find any window of opportunity to fully interpret them.</p>

  <p>And this problem troubled the people in the divine land all the way until the present time.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods interested in Sanskrit words had, at one point, tried solving the problem. It was already a shame that no one had managed to interpret the words up until now. Great fortune would come to anyone who could do it.</p>

  <p>A wise man would, at a glance, know that the group of seven golden Sanskrit words were indeed the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River.</p>

  <p>Even if the Sanskrit words were blurred by the middle-aged man, to the young man and the old man in white, the words were recognizable in an instant.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, Zheng shouldn't have been interested in the famously unsolvable problem at all.</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, Zheng actually showed a strong interest in the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River. From his excited expression, he probably thought he had happened upon a great treasure that was locked up for good.</p>

  <p>The two of them were left disappointed and speechless.</p>

  <p>Where on earth did the guy come from? Though he seemed to know nothing about Sanskrit words, he could somehow speak in such an accurate comprehension as casually as ever.</p>

  <p>The young man had a glimmer of hope, thinking Zheng would play a trick on the stall owner.</p>

  <p>"Hey, are you going to sell these seven Sanskrit words?" Zheng asked, squinting at the man.</p>

  <p>The thing about Sanskrit words was that, if you had no means to decipher them, they were practically worthless, save for using them as decorative pieces.</p>

  <p>According to Zheng's current understanding, there were very few Sanskrit words in the divine land that could be cracked completely. Now, he was wondering how to haggle for the Sanskrit words at a low price.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man, the old man in white, and the young man all had a similar thought.</p>

  <p>The people in the divine land unaware of the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River were usually all newbies who had only just entered the martial world. The stall owner thought he had found another target to rip off.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man raised his head and opened his eyes a little wider, throwing a faint glance at Zheng. He smiled coldly and said, "My seven Sanskrit words aren't easy to get your hands on, but because I have them here with me, I'll sell them only to someone who knows their true value!"</p>

  <p>"Name your price," Zheng simply said, unwilling to waste any time on him.</p>

  <p>The other stretched out his hand and proudly said, "Five thousand divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what the middle-aged man said, the vendors around widened their eyes in surprise.</p>

  <p>All of them stared at Zheng in silence as if he was some idiot that had wandered into town having a strong interest in the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the industry's rule that forbade them from competing with each other, they'd all be happy having sent the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River to Zheng for only five divine might coins.</p>

  <p>But at the same time, they were secretly cursing the middle-aged man for his stupidity. The young man was merely a low-rank True God, and they all doubted he even had five thousand divine might coins on him. It was stupid, they figured, to offer such a high price for them.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was sure Zheng couldn't afford it; he just wanted to see Zheng's reaction.</p>

  <p>Normally, a newbie would sulk in disappointment upon hearing the price, and then bargain with the seller for a lower price, which the middle-aged man was expecting.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's expression made the middle-aged man's heart race.</p>

  <p>'He's hesitating? How is that possible?</p>

  <p>Can he actually afford to pay five thousand divine might coins?' the man thought to himself as he watched Zheng carefully and calmly, not letting his expression betray his true feelings.</p>

  <p>The old man in white and the young man were still on the sidelines, continuing to watch the scene unfold.</p>

  <p>"Looks like he really wants to buy the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River."</p>

  <p>"The seller's offer didn't scare him away. Just how rich is this guy?"</p>

  <p>Finally, Zheng frowned slightly before giving a small smile. "Isn't the price a little too high?"</p>

  <p>The other assessed Zheng's reaction and said lazily, "The price is difficult to set. For those who know their worth, these seven Sanskrit words are priceless. These people would be willing to buy them for five hundred thousand divine might coins. For those who don't know their worth, they wouldn't even buy them for five measly coins."</p>

  <p>And he was right.</p>

  <p>But only those who could decipher the words could ever hope to know their value.</p>

  <p>Five thousand divine might coins weren't even worth mentioning to Zheng.</p>

  <p>With his current status, ordinary clans were incomparable to him in terms of wealth. And there was also the fact that the divine might coins were produced continuously in his inner world.</p>

  <p>"They're just too expensive," Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"You may leave, then," said the seller calmly. And if Zheng was really to leave, he was ready to offer a lower price. The man almost grinned from ear to ear. He would've been happy to sell the words at the price of a hundred divine might coins, let alone five thousand.</p>

  <p>But of course, he had no clue he was to encounter a truly rich man today.</p>

  <p>Pursing his lips, Zheng sighed and finally gave in. "Okay. Five thousand."</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man's eyes shot wide open when he saw the mass of black divine might coins pouring from Zheng's hand. His heart started racing wildly as he was worried about how unrealistic the situation seemed.</p>

  <p>Even the rest of the crowd had their mouths hanging open as they stared blankly at Zheng. The divine might coins were flowing out in waves.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" The old man clad in white couldn't stay calm any longer.</p>

  <p>He exchanged a glance with the young man, and just as the stall owner was about to reach for the pile of coins, the two of them rushed over like a gust of wind.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" The old man in white stopped Zheng.</p>

  <p>And the young man glared at the middle-aged man maliciously.</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of the two had Zheng puzzled.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"The seven Sanskrit words aren't worth such a price. If you really need them, I can give them to you for free!" The old man smiled as he gave the offer.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the seller grew anxious, worried he would lose his chance to get the five thousand divine might coins. "Don't you know the rules? How could you stop him? We made a deal!"</p>

  <p>To that, the young man only sneered. "Rules? My clan set the very rules of the Famous Sword Divine City. If you want to stay here, don't you dare mention the rules to me!"</p>

  <p>His declaration had the middle-aged man stumped. He looked the young man up and down and suddenly realized something, so he kept his mouth shut.</p>
