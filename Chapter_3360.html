  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ticket to the Chaotic Source World was actually a slice of divine crystal which was cut in a very clever manner.</p>

  <p>Four small runes that were drawn on the ticket absorbed the internal divine crystal energy and spread it around. If any of its corners was damaged, the entire ticket would be broken into pieces.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that since the ticket to the Chaotic Source World was too precious, many creatures had dared to make copies of it.</p>

  <p>That was why the tickets were made in such a clever way, to prevent plagiarism.</p>

  <p>The Evil God held the ticket close to his face, then looked at it with a critical eye.</p>

  <p>He had suffered a lot during his time in the Black Mountain Guild, especially when he was a newcomer. Some warriors at the Other Shore Realm had even subdued him too much with their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Yet, he never yielded. In fact, he had even made rapid progress in just a short amount of time. Eventually, he had gotten to either defeat or kill those who had once repressed him.</p>

  <p>He had gone through so much for just this little ticket.</p>

  <p>He casually tucked it into the space ring and said, "Is there any way to get me a space ring on the Other Shore? I got so many Other Shore Tokens but I can't take them away. What a pity!"</p>

  <p>It was actually easy to create Sumeru Space on the Other Shore. The super powers usually raised Thunder Beasts in their temples and they all had their own unique technology to make space rings.</p>

  <p>The only thing was Evil God had always acted on his own and had no contact with the others on the Other Shore. Who would make a space ring for him?</p>

  <p>He had wanted to rush into the temples and force them to carve a space ring for him. But to his disappointment, they had set up restriction against the outsiders in their temples. No matter how strong his Soul of Light was, there was nothing he could do.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had no choice but to throw away many tokens he'd obtained on the Other Shore, save for some extremely valuable ones that were hidden in his Soul of Light. That was really a great pity for him.</p>

  <p>When Shera heard his words, she glanced contemptuously at him and said,</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Tokens obtained in the Lust World are just rubbish. It's not a waste to throw them away. Besides, we don't have any allies in the Lust World."</p>

  <p>The Black Ship had a very small population, but each of its members was a peerless master. They wouldn't have gone to the Lust World if it weren't for some special reasons.</p>

  <p>"No! You are rubbish!" Evil God spat back.</p>

  <p>He truly hated it when others doubted him. It was just like his time in the Black Mountain Guild all over again, wherein he killed anyone who ever dared to question him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Shera turned around. Her eyes glittered coldly under her sleek, black bangs.</p>

  <p>If it was another man who had provoked her like this, she would have killed him already. But now, she resisted the urge to tear Evil God up despite his arrogance.</p>

  <p>Then, she reached out to pinch in the air above Evil God.</p>

  <p>Evil God, who was an arrogant and invincible man in the Black Mountain Guild, was deformed by her squeeze without any ability to resist.</p>

  <p>After that, Shera threw him abruptly into the Black Ship. The ship then started to speed up to the west.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Athemar kept his promise and gave Zheng a pile of tickets.</p>

  <p>Zheng held a pile of black cards in hand, which emitted a faint aura of divine crystal.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace didn't get many tickets to the Chaotic Source World this time. Moreover, all the sects of the seven mountains had to share the tickets.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Flow Sword Sect got less. It wasn't easy for Athemar to get seven tickets for him.</p>

  <p>"This ticket is so elaborate," Zheng muttered to himself as he walked towards the house opposite to his.</p>

  <p>As the opening time of the Chaotic Source World approached, Hutton, Sally and the others became more and more nervous.</p>

  <p>That day, Athemar just promised that he would try his best to get the tickets, but all of them clearly knew how rare the tickets were.</p>

  <p>"Hutton… What if the Oneness Sky Palace can't get us tickets?" Sally asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Hutton, who sat on the couch in the courtyard, shook his head and said, "We have no choice but to wait for the charity from them now."</p>

  <p>"Then Grandpa's hope would be deflated. We'd gain nothing from our journey!" came Umar's cold rebuttal.</p>

  <p>When Hutton saw that Umar had gotten a little mad, he reminded, "Don't forget that the Oneness Sky Palace doesn't owe us anything. They helped us for the sake of Zheng.</p>

  <p>It's not their duty to give us tickets!" "But Zheng..." Umar said defiantly.</p>

  <p>Just then, the door to the house was pushed open.</p>

  <p>Restrictions had been set up in front of the door, so ordinary people couldn't open it.</p>

  <p>They knew it must be Zheng who had come in. "Young master!" Hutton suddenly stood up.</p>

  <p>"Zheng," Sally greeted him with a smile.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Zheng felt a little lightheaded when he was addressed in such a way. Yet since Hutton insisted, he didn't correct him anymore. It wouldn't work on him anyway.</p>

  <p>Everyone of the Nine Li race looked nervous, and Zheng naturally understood why. A smile appeared on his face. With a flick of his hand, a few black cards appeared in his palm. "Are you waiting for them?"</p>

  <p>Once he revealed the stack of black cards, the others immediately went wild with joy.</p>

  <p>The matter had worried them deeply over the past few days. Now that they'd gotten the tickets, they could finally sigh in relief.</p>

  <p>After all, they weren't that confident in Zheng as they hadn't had much contact with him before.</p>

  <p>But Zheng took his responsibility to help them since it was Ambrose who had brought them here in person.</p>

  <p>If Athemar or even the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't get them tickets, Zheng would buy enough from the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>"Young master..." Hutton tried to say something to show his gratitude, but he was speechless.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand and said, "Since we are from the same race, you don't need to be too polite with me. There's only a month left. We're going to set off after we finish preparations."</p>

  <p>The tickets to the Chaotic Source World were distributed to various sects in succession.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy for other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to obtain even one.</p>

  <p>Although Milo and Zheng could get the tickets directly, the others of the Flow Sword Sect needed to compete for the remaining ten ones.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Unique Array Sword Sect and the Killing Sword Sect also fell into a fierce competition because of those tickets.</p>

  <p>Even the direct descendants had to win the competition to prove their strength before they could get the tickets.</p>

  <p>A month later, a gentle wind blew through the sails of the seven giant flying ships as they slowly rose up. Soon enough, they had left the Oneness Sky Palace and flew westward.</p>

  <p>The seven flying ships belonged to the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the one that led them belonged to the Oneness Mountain. Of course, disciples from the Phoenix Palace and the three sword sects were in it.</p>

  <p>To get to the Chaotic Source World, they had to cross over a hundred provinces. Even if the flying ships could penetrate space, they still had to pass through the walls between provinces when they reached the boundaries. Since they had to pause for a moment, it was clearly impossible for them to travel too fast.</p>

  <p>Inside the huge flying ships were hundreds of cubicles that were arranged neatly.</p>

  <p>Even though the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were on the journey, they still continued to cultivate themselves tirelessly.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, the competition in the Chaotic Source World was also extremely fierce. Not everyone who entered it could get through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace either cultivated their Souls of Light on the Other Shore, consolidated their own sword theurgy, or practiced the use of their newly fused Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Half a month later, the seven flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace came out of the space barrier, and entered a snow-filled world.</p>

  <p>Once they reached the cold place, all the disciples from the Oneness Mountain went up to the deck to have a bird's eye view of the area covered with snow and ice.</p>

  <p>Zheng leaned on the rail as the chilly air caressed his face.</p>

  <p>They had now arrived at the Icy Snow Province, where the Chaotic Source World was located.</p>
