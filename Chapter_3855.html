<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The huge shadow of Snake Goddess stayed still up in the sky as its arms held the black ship.</p>

  <p>Snake Goddess and the captain of the Black Ship previously used their own methods to learn about the full situation, and they also watched the battle between Fuxi and the Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>Just now, the captain of the Black Ship thought that the Snake Goddess was too confident. After all, the Xuanyuan was still quite powerful, and it wasn't easy for Fuxi to take him down.</p>

  <p>When they fought, however, it was evident that they were far too different.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was much more powerful than everyone had expected. The captain quickly grew serious, and he said, "It seems that there is a reason for your confidence in the Human Sovereign."</p>

  <p>"Of course," the Snake Goddess said with a glint in her cat-like eyes.</p>

  <p>"But, are you confident enough to trap me here?" At that moment, the captain looked at the shadow of Snake Goddess above his head.</p>

  <p>If Fuxi had really killed the Xuanyuan, then the members of the Black Ship and the Divine Farmer would fall into Fuxi's hands no matter who won.</p>

  <p>The mere thought of it made the captain restless.</p>

  <p>"If you want to try, you can do it with Mahoney," the Snake Goddess calmly said as she looked towards the void on the left.</p>

  <p>The area exhibited a wave of space fluctuation, and Mahoney, who was hiding inside, appeared.</p>

  <p>"You are quite keen, Snake Goddess," she said.</p>

  <p>"Your whispers are too loud," the Snake Goddess replied.</p>

  <p>At first, Mahoney planned to attack the captain, but the captain asked his crew to fight, so things changed.</p>

  <p>She had been hiding in the dark and waiting for a good chance. She never thought that the Xuanyuan would be disadvantaged, so she took the initiative to communicate with the captain.</p>

  <p>While all of that happened, the Snake Goddess had cleverly captured the wave of their consciousness. "I wonder who is stronger, you or the Human Sovereign?" the captain asked.</p>

  <p>In reality, Fuxi's power scared the captain. He hadn't seen the Snake Goddess fight for a long time. If she was as strong as Fuxi, then things would get tricky.</p>

  <p>The captain was first quite confident in himself. He thought that he was as strong as the Xuanyuan, so when he saw that the Xuanyuan got defeated all the time, he became not that confident.</p>

  <p>Confidence was the foundation of strength, but arrogance that grew out of confidence was a hindrance to survival.</p>

  <p>The captain had what he had today because he never underestimated any of his opponents.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked down and shook her head. "If I were the Human Sovereign, and the Xuanyuan didn't have another trump card, he would have died," she commented.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Mahoney and the captain frowned.</p>

  <p>Did the Snake Goddess mean that she was stronger than Fuxi?</p>

  <p>"If so, then we can only try," the captain stated.</p>

  <p>A cyan Other Shore Token appeared on the surface of Mahoney's body. It was the Spearhead Armor of Destruction that Emperor Ji had worn.</p>

  <p>Then, a powerful force continuously gathered within her body.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess gently raised her head and put her hands on either side.</p>

  <p>Her large shadow followed suit and waved its hands to slap both the captain's and Mahoney's heads.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The shadow of Snake Goddess was made out of pure energy and could erode almost anything.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it was much purer than those of the people of Li Shan mountain because she was their leader.</p>

  <p>In turn, Mahoney flew backward to avoid the energy beams.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the captain of the Black Ship stood at the side and waited for the shadow of Snake Goddess to descend from the sky. As soon as her shadow landed on the black ship, his black cloak exploded.</p>

  <p>A bald man emerged from the black cloak. He was covered in a thin layer of scales and had two sharp horns on his forehead.</p>

  <p>The captain didn't resist but let the energy beam hit him.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Some of the long and thin energy beams at the end of the shadow of Snake Goddess landed on the black ship.</p>

  <p>The black ship immediately shattered, while the energy eroded its wooden body and set it on fire.</p>

  <p>Then, the energy beams in the middle lashed at the captain's skin and burned him. Bright red blood gushed out of his charred black scars.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess found it strange that the captain didn't dodge. However, she would never hesitate in such a battle.</p>

  <p>Since he didn't avoid the attacks, she would kill him first.</p>

  <p>The fabric of her golden dress fluttered when she slightly twisted her waist.</p>

  <p>Her shadow followed her and turned around, then forced Mahoney back with ease.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, she reached out her other hand towards the captain.</p>

  <p>Her shadow also did the same thing with one hand and the tentacle-like energy beams wrapped around the captain.</p>

  <p>The erosion caused by the pure energy beams was terrible, especially since they came from the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>The energy beams went into the captain's body at a visible speed. Blood spurted out of his sunken body, then the energy beams quickly evaporated it.</p>

  <p>Mahoney was stunned when she saw the scene.</p>

  <p>Was the captain trying to get himself killed?</p>

  <p>Would the Snake Goddess kill him in that way?</p>

  <p>Or perhaps the Snake Goddess had used a method that made the captain unable to dodge?</p>

  <p>Multiple thoughts swam in Mahoney's head. She now wanted to escape as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the energy beams quickly eroded the captain's body into two. His whole body melted like a candle. He would surely die.</p>

  <p>Still, the Snake Goddess didn't feel relaxed at all. She didn't think that the captain was dead. Instead, she remained highly vigilant and stared straight at the other black ships not far away.</p>

  <p>"The power of your shadow is truly extraordinary." The captain's voice floated over. This time, he appeared on another black ship.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Just then, Mahoney squinted to get a closer look.</p>

  <p>Truth was, it wasn't difficult to get a physical avatar with their strength. It also wasn't hard to distinguish if the opponent was a real body or an avatar.</p>

  <p>Mahoney just saw that the shadow of Snake Goddess had eroded the captain's real body. How did he reappear?</p>

  <p>Maybe he had used some rare Other Shore Token to bring himself back to life, but there was no reason for him to let the Snake Goddess kill him once.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the rumor is true," said the Snake Goddess. She bit her lips, crossed her hands, and waved them.</p>

  <p>"I heard that the captain of the Black Ship doesn't have a real body. These ships are your bodies!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment she finished speaking, countless energy beams lashed towards the black ships like whips.</p>

  <p>Most people thought that the Black Ship was an intimidating force, but the real strong ones were its members. The ships were just ordinary flying ships.</p>

  <p>Without the help of those at the Eternal Realm, the ordinary warriors at the Holy Soul Realm or even the Chaotic Source Realm could destroy them.</p>

  <p>But when the Snake Goddess's energy beams struck the ships, there was only a muffled sound, and the beams just bounced off the ships' surfaces.</p>

  <p>The powerful energy beams had lost their desired effect. "In addition to the fact that my real bodies are the ships, I wonder what else you have found out?" the captain said from the ship.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess thought for a while before she asked hesitantly, "Have you integrated with the Land of Ancient Flesh?" The Land of Ancient Flesh was an immensely dangerous place.</p>

  <p>It was quite a small land in the far south of the Three Purities Stage, but it was frightening and forbidden.</p>

  <p>After all, its exterior was a large piece of flesh.</p>

  <p>It also had a distinct feature. Any power could only work there once. The second and succeeding times, they would be ineffective.</p>
