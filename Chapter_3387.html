<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3387 An Area Insulated From Wind </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth. He knew the Shade Stone liquid wasn't indestructible, but at this point, he had no choice.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone liquid covered his back, like a thin sheet. If he was attacked with something that had high penetrating strength, it was possible it'd be able to pierce through it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a blue light shot at Luo Zheng. Eyes narrowed, he desperately searched for a solution.</p>

  <p>Because he was trapped in the hurricane, his control over his bodily movement was extremely limited. At this rate, he wouldn't be able to dodge the blue light at all.</p>

  <p>"Shade Stone liquid, condensing!"</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't avoid the light, his last resort was to face it head-on.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone liquid, which was scattered all over his back, suddenly gathered in one spot on his back.</p>

  <p>After the Shade Stone liquid condensed, its defensive power doubled as well.</p>

  <p>'She's targeting the center of my back!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gathered the condensed Shade Stone liquid at the center of his back.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the arrow hit him, Luo Zheng was enveloped in a dazzling blue light.</p>

  <p>Both Lesly and Brylee smiled. In their eyes, Luo Zheng wasn't strong enough to withstand an attack from the Heavenly South Bow.</p>

  <p>However, to their surprise, after the blue light dissipated, Luo Zheng was still alive!</p>

  <p>They froze in shock. Exchanging stunned glances, they were at a loss at what to do next.</p>

  <p>"W-what?!"</p>

  <p>Brylee stuttered, unable to conceal her shock.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly South Bow was her most powerful weapon.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it cost a lot just to use such a powerful Other Shore Token. If they had known any other way to deal with Luo Zheng, Brylee wouldn't have considered using the Heavenly South Bow.</p>

  <p>And yet, Luo Zheng had managed to survive Brylee's supposed trump card.</p>

  <p>"Ahem!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng coughed. With a frown, he spat out the golden blood.</p>

  <p>The blood dispersed in the whirling air quickly.</p>

  <p>In the end, the condensed Shade Stone liquid did save his life, but it didn't spare him from some internal injuries.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his injuries weren't too bad. He knew he'd recover in no time.</p>

  <p>However, the hurricane kept on blowing, rendering him helpless. After all, the two women still targeted him. If they shot a few more arrows at him, he'd be done for.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lesly and Brylee also considered their options.</p>

  <p>"How could the Taiyi Heaven Palace have such a superhuman warrior?"</p>

  <p>Lesly muttered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>After Brylee recovered from the initial shock, she clenched her fists. This only made her more determined to take Luo Zheng down. Gripping the Heavenly South Bow, she notched another blue arrow onto the bowstring. "You are able to block the first arrow," she said quietly, "but can you block the second?"</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Jin Wu were enemies now.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Phoenix loathed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If he was allowed to live and grew stronger with time, he would inevitably become a huge threat to the Jin Wu. Bearing this in mind, Brylee was determined to spare him no mercy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, rolling in the hurricane, quickly wiped the blood from his mouth and laughed. "Go on and try. I also want to know how many arrows I can resist!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was confident in the Shade Stone liquid; he could move it to whichever part of his body was going to be hit by Brylee's arrows. At worst, he would only be injured by the vibrating impact of the blows, but he knew the arrow wouldn't pierce through the Shade Stone liquid.</p>

  <p>As soon as the hurricane stopped, Luo Zheng would finally be able to strike back.</p>

  <p>Seeing the confident look on Luo Zheng's face, Brylee couldn't help but feel a little anxious. What if he could really resist all of the arrows?</p>

  <p>"Brylee," Lesly suddenly said, "shoot two arrows at the same time. Aim for his head with one, and his cinnabar field with the other."</p>

  <p>Although Lesly did not understand how the Shade Stone liquid worked, she could tell that Luo Zheng would be able to block the second arrow. She also knew that once the hurricane died down after five minutes, Luo Zheng would have the upper hand, and they'd be forced to retreat.</p>

  <p>They needed to be smart about this.</p>

  <p>Brylee nodded. With a tap of her finger, another blue arrow appeared on the bowstring.</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, she took steady aim at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a man from the Separate Abyss race got caught in the hurricane and whirled into the sky. To his surprise, he suddenly saw the tense battle between Luo Zheng and the two women.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he never expected such a fight would take place inside this damned hurricane.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he saw Brylee fitting two arrows onto the bowstring.</p>

  <p>He knew that it'd be difficult to disperse the Shade Stone liquid to two different parts of his body, and that its defensive properties would definitely weaken in this way.</p>

  <p>"I see the fear in your eyes," Lesly said smugly as she noticed Luo Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just sighed. "Well, even a lion will use all its strength to prey on a rabbit. I guess I shouldn't have gone easy on you..."</p>

  <p>"A lion fights a rabbit?" Lesly echoed. "Do you think you are a lion?"</p>

  <p>Exhaling slowly, Brylee steadily aimed the two arrows at Luo Zheng's head and belly. She couldn't possibly miss the target at so short a distance.</p>

  <p>Only the demon women of the Divine Lair and the creatures of a few races which could fly would be able to battle in a hurricane. Even if Luo Zheng had any tricks up his sleeve, he wouldn't be able to pose a threat to them as long as the hurricane whirled on. Hence, Lesly and Brylee grew complacent.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Brylee released the arrows and two blue lights shot towards Luo Zheng. Just as suddenly, a diamond-shaped thorny ball appeared above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power of the diamond-shaped thorny ball was not powerful, but a cyan feather began to emerge from it.</p>

  <p>The cyan feather looked so dainty and lifelike!</p>

  <p>Two huge cyan wings appeared behind Luo Zheng as soon as the cyan feather emerged from the thorny ball.</p>

  <p>The shadow of the massive wings reached over a thousand feet, flapping formidably in the air.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Brylee and Lesly knew they were absolutely no match for this, as Luo Zheng seemed to become extremely powerful at this moment.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu was the most powerful among the races which could fly in the air. Few things in the world could scare them. But now, they trembled at the sight of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two beams of arrow radiance from the Heavenly South Bow were still shooting towards him, but Luo Zheng twisted his body and rose with the wind, easily dodging the two blue rays. Suddenly, he froze in the air, and locked eyes with the two demon women.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Brylee and Lesly could fly in this hurricane, but they could only fly downwind. They couldn't even stop in the wind. After all, the hurricane's power reached thousands of Jun!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng suddenly stopped in the air, the two demon women, who were flying with the wind, were headed straight at him with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>There was no time for them to react or even try to change their direction. As they closed in on Luo Zheng, the two women's fear-filled eyes were reflected in Luo Zheng's long sword light.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly raised his sword, and swung it to the left and then right in a flash.</p>

  <p>The two demon women passed by Luo Zheng, as though nothing happened.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, Lesly and Brylee had flown past Luo Zheng around three miles. They flew with the wind, motionless, shock still seared on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>On each of their delicate necks, a line of blood appeared, and then slowly, their heads were peeled off their bodies.</p>

  <p>As the hurricane continued to blow, their heads flew farther and farther away from their beheaded bodies, fear still engraved in their lifeless eyes.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The hurricane still blew like mad, as though unaffected by the fact that a gruesome battle had just taken place.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still, letting the powerful hurricane blow towards him.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng's body was covered with an invisible thin film. As the hurricane blew black smog to him, it just whizzed past, with Luo Zheng remaining unaffected.</p>
