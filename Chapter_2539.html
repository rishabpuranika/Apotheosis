<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Zelda escaped to the Iron Tribe and managed to hide her identity, she smoothly took Luther there.</p>

  <p>For Luther's sake, a lot of masters sacrificed themselves.</p>

  <p>It wasn't within Zelda's expectations that Luther would be killed by these pariahs.</p>

  <p>She couldn't accept it.</p>

  <p>Even when she struggled, a powerful force crushed on her chest and firmly nailed her huge body to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I gave you a chance," the Wild God said with his lips pulled in a hideous smile.</p>

  <p>With every word he spoke, his palm tightened to crush Luther into a pool of blood.</p>

  <p>In that moment, a figure flew over from the side of the Wild God.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The sharp light of a silver sword flashed in everyone's eyes in an instant.</p>

  <p>A thin line appeared on the arm that held Luther and half of it dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Luther had accepted the situation and had already closed his eyes to wait for his death.</p>

  <p>The giant hand that held him loosened its grip and his eyes snapped open when he fell with it.</p>

  <p>"Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Luther's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Zelda grinned wide.</p>

  <p>Right at the critical moment, the bizarre stranger actually came back.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?!" the Wild God roared furiously as he clutched the stump of his arm.</p>

  <p>The question made Zheng's lips twitch as he hovered in the air. He didn't answer the question and turned into a flash of light again and shot over.</p>

  <p>Since he already had an initial understanding of this world, Zheng could now predict the consequences of his actions.</p>

  <p>These were just Wild Gods who relied on the tribe to cultivate and they had no foundation. Killing them wouldn't bring any trouble.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng didn't know much about Zelda and Luther, they were the first people he met in this world, and so he trusted them. In order to save Luther, he naturally wouldn't show any mercy.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>When another Wild God saw Zheng transform into a beam of light that was incredibly fast and rushed over, he suddenly stretched out a big hand and plucked up Zheng.</p>

  <p>"How dare you be so arrogant? You can't even activate the shape of the Wild God!" The Wild God smugly laughed at Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The booming laugh lasted for only a couple of seconds before blood spurted out his palm and dripped down his arm.</p>

  <p>Each time more blood spurted, more of his arm would break into pieces.</p>

  <p>The arm, which was almost sixty feet long, was cut into pieces as Zheng brandished his long sword and kept on attacking.</p>

  <p>As bloody lines reached up to the giant Wild God's shoulder, another crescent shaped sword light roared out and hit his neck.</p>

  <p>Without looking back at the severed head of the Wild God that fell on the ground, Zheng rushed to his next target.</p>

  <p>It was a shock to the remaining Wild Gods and when they finally came to their senses, they turned around and ran.</p>

  <p>Every step they took was so large that it spanned several hundred feet, but even at their fastest, they couldn't escape from Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>With two dull thuds, the fleeing Wild Gods trembled until their skulls that were as huge as houses tumbled down their bodies. Eventually, their bodies turned back into normal size.</p>

  <p>"Amazing! Zheng's so powerful!" Luther's eyes gleamed with excitement.</p>

  <p>A complicated expression was on Zelda's face as she arranged her messy hair and looked at Zheng's small figure.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng was powerful, Zelda thought that he was only slightly stronger than her.</p>

  <p>But his astonishing actions changed her judgment.</p>

  <p>Zheng killed the Wild Gods as easy as flipping his palm. How powerful was he really?</p>

  <p>"Are you okay?" Zheng stood in front of Zelda, his face holding a trace of concern.</p>

  <p>Zelda smiled and said, "We would have been in trouble if you didn't show up."</p>

  <p>Zelda was very optimistic.</p>

  <p>While they were fighting the Wild Gods, several houses of the Iron Tribe were destroyed and some people died.</p>

  <p>It was an everyday fight in this wilderness and no one cared about the lives of these people.</p>

  <p>Zelda wanted a home for her and her brother and so she chose to stay here.</p>

  <p>After clearing up the mess, the people of the tribe held long spears and sticks, and went west. Zelda left the Iron Tribe with them.</p>

  <p>There were only few old, very young, and badly injured members left in the Iron Tribe.</p>

  <p>"Where are they going?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>However, a repeat of a situation like this wouldn't astonish Luther. He flatly replied, "Plunder. We won this battle so they go to plunder the wild bones, women, food..." There was a contempt on his face. "What a barbaric way of living. It's hard for Zelda to have to do this with them."</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Zheng's face as he listened to Luther's complaints. "You and your sister aren't barbarians?"</p>

  <p>The words made Luther realize his slip of tongue and his mouth snapped shut immediately.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng saved their lives and helped Zelda a lot, they still found it hard to fully trust him.</p>

  <p>It was clear to Zheng that they must have their stories, but since they didn't tell, he wouldn't ask.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, the people of the Iron Tribe returned one after another.</p>

  <p>True to Luther's words, they stripped the Macon Tribe of everything, including food and women.</p>

  <p>As for the wild bones, they were taken by Zelda.</p>

  <p>"I thought the members of the Macon Tribe exchanged all their wild bones with the Falcon Caravan but they kept more than thirty." Zelda seemed very happy.</p>

  <p>Thirty was a huge number of wild bones for Zheng in the past.</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng had over ten thousand wild bones so he didn't care about Zelda's wild bones.</p>

  <p>When Zelda noticed Zheng's calm expression, she asked, "Have you sold the blood wild bone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>It worried Zelda for Zheng to sell the blood wild bone in the Sand Core City. The Falcon Caravan was just a small force in the city but it was still a giant monster that they didn't dare to provoke. If the whole process didn't go well, Zheng probably wouldn't be able to return. She didn't expect that the blood wild bone would be auctioned off so smoothly.</p>

  <p>"How much was it?"</p>

  <p>It hit Zelda that the blood wild bone must be auctioned off at a high price and so her voice became a little excited.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen thousand."</p>

  <p>"Thirteen thousand? What a large sum!"</p>

  <p>Zelda covered her mouth with her hand.</p>

  <p>It was a puny number of wild bones in her previous clan.</p>

  <p>But in this barren area of the Immemorial Wilderness, it was definitely a lot!</p>

  <p>"I'll leave five hundred wild bones to you. After I refine and absorb the rest, I'll leave." Zheng smiled softly.</p>

  <p>It was thanks to Zelda that he got to know this world and so he'd give her the wild bones as a gift.</p>

  <p>"You'll leave? Where do you want to go?"</p>

  <p>Zelda appreciated the gift but she was more concerned about Zheng's destination.</p>
