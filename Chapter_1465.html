<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As though they had gotten caught between two iron pincers, Freya's hands were bound. How could she possibly break free?</p>

  <p>Having said that, the look on Zheng's face became rather alarming. How was he supposed to get rid of the malicious Mu Ning in her body?</p>

  <p>Initially, the malicious Mu Ning was just gradually accumulating, and the speed at which it progressed wasn't really that fast. It was quite possible that there were martial artists who weren't capable of killing a hundred thousand living creatures even after a couple centuries. However, there was a handful of evil martial artists who could lay waste to people in multiple cities in just a short span of time, and they were inclined to pull stunts that angered the people.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, there were a lot of martial artists who had accumulated a vast amount of malicious Mu Ning at such an alarming rate.</p>

  <p>How on earth would they be able to get rid of all that?</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng were to lend Freya a helping hand in leaving the underground palace, the malicious Mu Ning residing in her body would still pose a significant threat.</p>

  <p>If it came to that, then the Endless Abyss would only end up being a cul-de-sac for them.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng, who had stepped foot into the Killing Sword Mountain, was the only person who could withstand it by making use of the mountain. In the end, the other martial artists started to lose their minds and fight amongst each other. Right above Zheng's head, violent energy was fluctuating. If this didn't come to a halt, none of them was going to make it.</p>

  <p>As all of these thoughts were running in circles in his head, Xun told him in his mind, "There's no need for you to worry. Freya is going to be just fine as soon as she gets out of this area. In the past, when I brought my clansmen here, we also encountered the malicious Mu Ning, and a lot of my people weren't able to pull through. But there was an area of purification right at the bottom of the abyss that had the ability to get rid of the malicious Mu Ning. It's gonna be beneficial for the martial artists."</p>

  <p>When he heard Xun's words, Luo Zheng was able to feel a bit at ease.</p>

  <p>Essentially, the most important thing for them to do right now was to make it through this part.</p>

  <p>The battles between the martial artists up there were becoming much fiercer by the minute. All in all, there were more than twenty Spirit Supreme Realm martial artists involved in that skirmish. All those men were utilizing their trump cards, so it should go without saying that the power they were letting out could make someone's blood run cold.</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, the abyss was totally indestructible. In comparison, if dozens of Spirit Supreme Realm martial artists were to engage in such a battle in the outside world, it most certainly wouldn't take long before the continent itself crumbled.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A thunderous sound emanated from somewhere within that chaos.</p>

  <p>Raising his head to check what it was, Luo Zheng found out that Lincoln had reduced an ogre martial artist into a bloody mist.</p>

  <p>In that exact moment, Lincoln's body was glowing with a golden light, with his eyes completely bloodshot. It should be worth mentioning that he possessed an exceptional amount of strength. Having the power at the later stage of Soul Sea Realm, he could lay waste to a Spirit Supreme Realm martial artist without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>After doing away with the ogre martial artist, Lincoln had his eyes set on the Demon Night blonde woman.</p>

  <p>Considering the formidable strength she had, she was probably a core talent of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place, as she carried a vast amount of treasures on her body. Right now, she had in her hand a well-crafted lantern that had been giving off a faint colored light which was cloaking her from within.</p>

  <p>As the malicious Mu Ning drifted toward her, the colored light prevented it from getting any closer. Because of that, she had not been affected by Mu Ning in any way from start to finish.</p>

  <p>Amongst all of the martial artists present, it was quite possible that only Luo Zheng and the golden-haired girl could keep their consciousness. Be that as it might, the methods they used were entirely different. For Luo Zheng, he had absorbed the malicious Mu Ning, pouring all of it into the Killing Sword Mountain. The girl, on the other hand, managed to directly avoid the specks of light formed by the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>In any case, being able to maintain their consciousness wasn't of any use whatsoever, because the others could still attack them just as well. Like a ferocious beast, Lincoln lunged at the golden-haired girl.</p>

  <p>At first, the girl gave an effort to evade his attacks. At the end of the day, Lincoln's attack was just too powerful, so this was her best option to get away from it. Unfortunately for her, after safely avoiding it a number of times, Lincoln was able to back her into a corner.</p>

  <p>Having been caught in such a situation, a somewhat stern look crept up onto her face. Raising the lantern she was holding, a few unclear words came out of her mouth.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't really able to catch what she was saying, but he noticed that in that moment, the expression on Xun's face suddenly shifted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! I have a bad feeling about this. A storm is brewing!"</p>

  <p>"Why do you think that?" At present, Luo Zheng was at the tail end of the group. In spite of the fights being quite intense, it didn't really have much to do with him.</p>

  <p>Based on what Xun told him, the only thing he had to do was to endure this part. So, right now, he was simply watching the fights from the sidelines. As far as he was concerned, as long as he could keep Freya in check and stop her from taking part in the fights, that would be enough.</p>

  <p>"It appears that this girl possesses the ancient Demon Night bloodline!</p>

  <p>What she's doing right now is summoning the Power of Three Queens!"</p>

  <p>Xun said, sounding a bit anxious.</p>
