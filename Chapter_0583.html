</p>

  <p>"?" Faced with her apparent display of dismay and despise, Luo Luo Zheng felt a pinch of hurt. But he still continued collecting the "bodies" of the six puppet snakes into his space ring before following Tia.</p>

  <p>After walking in the world inside the flood dragon for a distance, Luo Luo Zheng spotted a red light from not too far away, in which something was fluttering rather violently. Luo Luo Zheng curiously asked, "What's that?"</p>

  <p>"That's the key!" Tia said as she spotted the key and accelerated her pace with a happy expression upon seeing her target.</p>

  <p>"Key? What does this key unlock?" Luo Luo Zheng asked as he approached from behind her. It turned out that the red light was a circular tripod furnace used for refining pills. Now, the tripod furnace was full of fire, in the centre of which was a long, narrow and slowly fluttering spar. Was this spar the key that Tia mentioned?</p>

  <p>"The key was used for inheriting the treasures of the whole Cloud Road!</p>

  <p>Before the destruction of the sixth-grade sect, all the treasures were put into the Cloud Road. As long as you get the key, you could obtain all the treasures!" Tia looked at the crystal key in the furnace up and down with admiration.</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean all the treasures of the Blood Fiend Emperor?" Luo Luo Zheng was so shocked that he opened his eyes wide and took a deep breath. It was a sixth-grade sect that the Blood Fiend Emperor had, while the Cloud Hall was only a fourth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that the treasures in the hidden test of the Cloud Road were of such enormous value. The Blood Fiend Emperor might have put part of his treasures into it. The Cloud Road was so long. It was definite that there was bound to be more than one hidden test along the way.</p>

  <p>How huge would all the treasures be then? A clear look of shock and bewilderment was set all across his face.</p>

  <p>Tia fixed her eyes on Luo Luo Zheng and asked, "Why do you know the Blood Fiend Emperor?"</p>

  <p>"Ah? That I will never tell you." Tia had many secrets, which gave Luo Luo Zheng an idea to do the same thing.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what Luo Luo Zheng said, Tia did not indulge into a detailed inquiry, but instead continued to stare at the furnace and said, "I have been here once, but I did not get the key. It was far too difficult."</p>

  <p>Once before? Just thinking about the question, Luo Luo Zheng learned the reason almost immediately. According to what the cyan dragon said, she needed to practice anew, and not only once. The last time she practised anew, she sneaked into here secretly. So she was so familiar with the Death Road.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Luo Zheng looked at the furnace and said.</p>

  <p>"The tripod furnace was way too powerful, and there was an enchantment that I couldn't destroy at the time." Tia stared at Luo Luo Zheng with burning eyes and suddenly said, "Didn't you ask me why I brought you here? This time, I was going to cooperate with Frank. I planned to deal with the tripod furnace with my own power and break the enchantment with Frank's spear. But then I changed my mind. Frank's spear has strong penetrating power, but it might not be able to break it completely. As you have practiced the Heavenly Ogre Fist, and I could provide you with enough life vitality, choosing you is a safer bet for me to ensure success."</p>

  <p>After hearing what Tia said, Luo Luo Zheng finally completely understood her motivation. She was looking for a powerful helper in the case as she alone couldn't obtain the crystal key without any assistance and support.</p>

  <p>At first, Frank was the best choice. Among the disciples of the Cloud Hall, he was the most powerful. And he majored in spear skills, which had the strongest penetrating power. Using his spear, he would be able to break the enchantment. However, Luo Zheng's appearance led Tia to believe that he was more likely to break it than Frank. So he was pulled into the flood dragon's mouth. If Luo Luo Zheng had not appeared, it would have been Frank that was here at the moment who would have gotten the opportunity.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng was slightly perplexed by the facts. With Tia's own mighty strength, couldn't she break the enchantment? However, Luo Luo Zheng knew that Tia would never answer this question honestly. So instead he just waited and watched patiently to figure it out for himself.</p>

  <p>"Well, say no more. Just, follow my command, take the crystal key!"</p>

  <p>After Tia finished speaking, she sat down on the ground. With a pair of delicate hands placed on her abdomen, she began to gather her life vitality and then pushed it toward the tripod furnace with determination.</p>

  <p>As Tia's palm winds blew past, the fire in the furnace suddenly burst into raging flames owing to the sudden interference. Soon, a fire flew out, and turned to be the shape of a daunting dragon!</p>

  <p>"Stand aside now! This is a fiery dragon spirit! It is a kind of fiery evil spirit, which is extremely powerful and mighty!" This time, Tia carefully and with calculated moves dealt with the fiery dragon spirit with a cautious expression across her delicate face. A piece of sky blue gem appeared as she turned over her hands, which sent out a wave of cold air, and immediately reduced the surrounding's temperature.</p>

  <p>Tia patted the gem ever so lightly and stretched out one of her delicate fingers. Her fingertip was going round and round over the gem, which seemed like she was guiding something out. Luo Luo Zheng saw her finger drawing several small circles and then gently pulled forward. "Go!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an ice phoenix came out from the gem, which yelped and flew toward the fiery dragon spirit.</p>
