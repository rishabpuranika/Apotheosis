<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1803 Shut The Strange Consciousness Out </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul had merged with the wills of all the great worlds.</p>

  <p>The wills of the great worlds did not possess their own intellect. They would only respond to the damage done to their respective great worlds by reacting instinctively.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul could already control all of the great worlds to some extent.</p>

  <p>The strange consciousness was exceedingly strong, and not something that Luo Zheng could contend with his current soul.</p>

  <p>However, he had the upper hand. He did not need to rely on his own soul to resist the consciousness.</p>

  <p>He could summon the wills of all the great worlds to resist it.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful one's soul was, it was impossible for it to resist the will of a great world. Moreover, now there were wills of one million and thirty-three great worlds. No creature in the universe would be able to deal with the shocking number of wills.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord who was skilled in cultivating the soul would fail to obstruct these wills.</p>

  <p>'This strange consciousness seems to be using some sort of secret technique and wants to fuse with the wills of the great worlds.' A curious expression appeared on Zheng's face as he pondered over the situation.</p>

  <p>His soul had been unintentionally merged into the wills of the great worlds, but it seemed as if his enemy had done it on purpose.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly. The wills of the great worlds followed his thought, and a trace of killing intent flickered.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A formless killing intent began to spread out.</p>

  <p>All the living beings in the one million and thirty-three great worlds looked up at the same time.</p>

  <p>The trace of killing intent was felt by all of them, including countless nature creatures, Illuminating Soul Realm warriors and Internal Elixir Realm warriors, lords of sacred places, emperors of divine kingdoms, vicious beasts hidden underground, mighty warriors perched atop mountains...</p>

  <p>"This is the killing intent of the heavens!"</p>

  <p>"The heavens are furious. Just who is it that has caused the heavens to be enraged?"</p>

  <p>"Please don't be angry!"</p>

  <p>"This is a great opportunity! I might learn something from the heavens."</p>

  <p>Countless creatures were trying to uncover the meaning behind this killing intent. They didn't know that a germ of an idea in Zheng's mind had sparked this vicious killing intent.</p>

  <p>Just how powerful was this killing intent?</p>

  <p>In just a split-second, the powerful invading consciousness was extinguished by the wills of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>The powerful consciousness was like a candle flame in a torrential downpour, completely fragile and weak. As a result, it was put out instantly!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords also sensed the murderous intent at the same time.</p>

  <p>Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord of Oracle and the others were also baffled. What was the source of this killing intent?</p>

  <p>They refused to believe that the great worlds would be so angry.</p>

  <p>The great worlds indeed had their wills, but the wills couldn't transform into various emotions and act upon them. The heavens were like a puppet that could only operate according to certain laws.</p>

  <p>What they did not expect was that the moment the killing intent was revealed, the map-like rune on the Torch Dragon's forehead would shatter suddenly. At the same time, she let out a sharp scream and could not help but cover her head with her hands.</p>

  <p>One's consciousness was an extension of their soul. As her consciousness had been killed by Luo Zheng, she was in incomparable pain.</p>

  <p>However, compared to the fear in her heart, this pain was insignificant.</p>

  <p>As she tried to merge her will with the wills of the great worlds, she was shocked to discover that there was another foreign will.</p>

  <p>The other will seemed to be existing there from before. How was this possible? Her mind was reeling now.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race had spent countless years and sacrificed a lot to plan this.</p>

  <p>Their goal was to subtly gain control of the entire heavens.</p>

  <p>Innumerable strategies were put in action, countless days and nights were spent without rest, and finally, this devious plan was hatched.</p>

  <p>Starting from the Lower World of the universe, the Torch Dragon's will would gradually spread to the entire universe, and finally reach the stars!</p>

  <p>That was the ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race overcame the manifold difficulties in executing this plan in rapid succession.</p>

  <p>One such hurdle was that they needed one million Insight Crystals to achieve their goal.</p>

  <p>These Insight Crystals were like the most precious treasures. They were used to cultivate one's soul.</p>

  <p>They were widely used in the divine land.</p>

  <p>These crystals were formed in the dark depths of the earth. They took many years to form completely in order to be usable.</p>

  <p>The process took about four to five billion years. It was no mean feat.</p>

  <p>The most frustrating part was that when the last round of grand era was destroyed, the Insight Crystals that they had painstakingly nurtured, had been demolished too.</p>

  <p>Billions of years of perseverance had been destroyed just like that!</p>

  <p>However, the sorcerer race had not given up. They had persevered and started from scratch, and patiently nurtured the crystals once more.</p>

  <p>In this way, the sorcerer race was the same as the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>The grand schemes of both races were recorded in their blood and were inherited by their kin. Every member from each generation would contribute to the progress of their respective plans in order to complete an unimaginable feat. It was all about team work here.</p>

  <p>All the windstorms would escalate at the same time, which would create a false will to fuse with the wills of the great worlds. When that time came, the Torch Dragon and the other sacred beasts as well as the supreme sorcerers of the sorcerer race would be able to connect with the great worlds and become their actual masters.</p>

  <p>Only then would they be endowed with the strength required to fight against the Supreme Lords, and only then would they have the qualifications to compete with the Celestial Position race!</p>

  <p>For the sake of this mission, they even pretended to attack the entire universe, launching devastating attacks on some of the sacred places of the 100, 000 supreme worlds. At the same time, they also spread the rumor that they were awakening the vicious beasts of the universe, while their real plans made significant headway.</p>

  <p>However, when they were feigning the attacks on the supreme worlds, they made a crucial mistake and were forced into the Lower World by Ning Yudie and her group. The sorcerer race happened to be plotting something in that great world.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, thanks to Luo Zheng, Master Feng's attention was drawn to Yudie's whereabouts too.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race was worried that their plan would be foiled, so they had no choice but to set their plan in motion ahead of time. They succeeded in their plan despite these Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, before the false will spread and managed to fuse with the wills of the great worlds, Luo Zheng had already merged with the will of one of the great worlds. Nobody in the sorcerer race saw this coming. And now that the false will had been diffused, Luo Zheng had become the sole controller of all of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon had failed miserably. This was an intolerable setback for the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng crushed the Torch Dragon's consciousness, he quickly discovered that there were some more powerful strange streams of consciousness, which were still attempting to merge with the wills of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>These streams of consciousness belonged to either the sacred beasts from the sorcerer race hiding in the great worlds, or supreme sorcerers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng simply would not tolerate the intrusion of these streams of consciousness!</p>

  <p>When this thought crossed his mind, the wills of the great worlds gave birth to a series of murderous intents, which completely annihilated all these streams of consciousness.</p>

  <p>And so, in addition to the Torch Dragon, the supreme sorcerers also experienced extreme pain. They also discovered that there was an abominable soul hidden within the wills of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell is that guy!" roared all the supreme sorcerers of the sorcerer race at the same time.</p>

  <p>Dissatisfaction, anger, disappointment and helplessness� these were the emotions reverberating from the back of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>The strange expressions on Master Feng's as well as the rest of the Supreme Lords' faces slowly turned into relieved smiles.</p>

  <p>They had already known about the sorcerer race's plans. Just a moment ago, they were extremely worried. After all, once all the great worlds were under the sorcerer race's control, they would be on the defensive.</p>

  <p>But now, they were witnessing the defeat of the Torch Dragon with triumphant smiles.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were also rather confused. Judging by the Torch Dragon's pitiful cry, it seemed that her soul had been damaged badly, so apart from them, who in the universe could possibly harm her?</p>

  <p>In their confusion, these Supreme Lords began to attack the Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon had already taken the human form, and her power was much weaker now. If she fused with the wills of the great worlds, these Supreme Lords would have no chance of defeating her. But now, all her hopes had turned to ashes, and in the end, she was beheaded by Supreme Lord of Oracle.</p>

  <p>The flame on her head continued to blaze. The Candle Dragon's fire was considered to be a rare one, so they obviously wouldn't extinguish it.</p>

  <p>Even after the Torch Dragon had been dead for many years, the flame would still continue to burn brightly.</p>

  <p>"The sorcerer race has actually devised a method to seize the heavens.</p>

  <p>That's really amazing!" Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment sighed.</p>

  <p>The Blessed Buddha Land led by him was powerful, but they were unable to come up with a plan like this. "But what happened? Why did the Torch Dragon fail?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng shook his head. He was also puzzled by the killing intent that arose in the great worlds. After pondering for a long while, he came to a conclusion. "It's possible that a traitor has appeared within the sorcerer race. One of them has fused with the wills of the great worlds and rejected the other wills."</p>

  <p>This was the only hypothesis Master Feng could make based on the clues at hand.</p>

  <p>How could he have known that someone else had fused with the wills of the great worlds and was now controlling them? And that person was not a member of the sorcerer race. It was none other than Luo Zheng!</p>
