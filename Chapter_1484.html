</p>

  <p>Livingston still wasn't convinced even as he followed Luo Luo Zheng into the library.</p>

  <p>Now that they were in this Immortal Mansion, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to help Freya and Livingston settle down into the Immortal Mansion. He also advised Freya to look around and pick out a book that might help her cultivate. Her original cultivation method was derived from the great world she had originally come from.</p>

  <p>Livingston was in awe at the sight of so many books before him. He effectively ignored those on cultivation methods since they would be useless for his current puppet body. What piqued his interest were the numerous texts on weapon refining, so much so that he even refused to leave after entering the library, too engrossed with his reading.</p>

  <p>Once the two were settled, Luo Luo Zheng immediately departed and, with a gentle tap of his hand, shrank the majestic Immortal Mansion back into the palm-sized token in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate was in tatters but it wouldn't be destroyed so easily in such a short period of time. Luo Luo Zheng was confident that if Yao's subjects launched an attack, then all he would need to do was to step back inside the Immortal Mansion. However, catching him at this point in time was unlikely since they would need to destroy the Reincarnation Plate first.</p>

  <p>Once done with his preparations, Luo Luo Zheng once again controlled the Reincarnation Plate and flew straight through the sky to roam around and explore the universe.</p>

  <p>In the Demon Night's core supreme world: the Punishment World.</p>

  <p>This supreme world's structure was incredibly unique owing to the fact that it was entirely made up of one huge mountain.</p>

  <p>This mountain was aptly named Punishment Mountain with its foot starting just at the edge of the world and extending all the way to the center.</p>

  <p>Of course, the residents of this world couldn't really feel like they were living in a mountain, because this mountain was just too huge. The only way one would be able to discern the form of the landmass was if they looked at it from a distance in space.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Punishment Palace stood like a beacon on the mountain world. Today, numerous Demon Night warriors gathered at its gate.</p>

  <p>These warriors, both men and women, that had gathered here were elders of the Demon Night who had lived for millions of years. A few had even undergone the Five Aging Processes already. They were mostly weathering away as they waited for death to consume them. There was no longer any possibility of extending their lifespans since they were mere world lords that could never attain immortality.</p>

  <p>"Let Yao out! We want an explanation!"</p>

  <p>"She has to explain what she did to the Board of Elders!"</p>

  <p>"We can't let her mess things up anymore!"</p>

  <p>The Board of Elders was an important fixture to the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Aside from the three queens, it was these elders who decided upon the internal matters of the race. The three queens already had their hands full of responsibilities: Yao was in charge of punishment, Xun of killing, and the Queen of Life was in charge of the continuation of their race. Thus, the affairs of handling the administrative workings of Demon Night were delegated to the Board of Elders, making them extremely important to the race.</p>

  <p>Yao and Xun's battle had begun seven hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>Killing a queen was an unimaginable thing to the Demon Night. It was the sort of crime whose punishment could never offset the deed.</p>

  <p>However, the Board of Elders had all said nothing when Yao made her move so many years ago.</p>

  <p>After all, what could they do if the one who wanted to kill the queen was another queen?</p>

  <p>The Board of Elders had chosen to remain silent after it had become apparent that Xun was going to die. After her death, all of them were unwilling to speak out against Yao and chose to quietly wait for a new queen to come instead.</p>

  <p>Seven hundred years! They waited seven hundred years for their new queen. No queen ever came though because there was no need for a replacement. Xun did not die and she even managed to return!</p>

  <p>The recovery of Xun's soul caused a ripple across the Board of Elders. They knew the old queen had the power to return but that did not ensure her success. They all had to wait and see what would happen.</p>

  <p>However, Yao was not willing to idly sit by. She quickly dispatched Viveca, Elspeth, Salvador, and Aneisha to kill Xun, which elevated the ripple into violent, crashing waves.</p>

  <p>Her actions had driven the Board of Elders into a frenzy. It wasn't the first time Yao had done something that caused dissatisfaction across the board, but her attempted re-assassination of Xun was the final straw. They knew they could no longer allow her to continue lest their entire race collapse.</p>

  <p>And so the Board of Elders decided to act. More than twenty of them gathered at the gate of Yao's Heavenly Punishment Palace.</p>

  <p>However, the palace gates remained closed.</p>

  <p>They had waited there for around fourteen hours now and some of the elders were already airing out their grievances. Some had even begun shouting and berating the guards.</p>

  <p>"Our queen is still sleeping. Please return another time," Enzo, the silver-haired guard, announced with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Do you take us as fools? I am more than a hundred times older than you! I was not born yesterday! Get Yao out here immediately!"</p>

  <p>"The Board of Elders is not a puppet. Xun is not a traitor. How could Yao treat her in such a manner?!"</p>

  <p>"If Yao does not come out of her palace and explain herself, then we will not hesitate to impeach her!"</p>

  <p>Enzo sneered at the elders' words, "Impeach her? You must be joking."</p>

  <p>It was true that the Board of Elders had the right to impeach queens and appoint new ones in paper. However, there had never been a need to exercise such a right.</p>

  <p>A Demon Night queen's influence ran deep after all. Those in the upper management had more insight into the conflicts that happened at the top, but the majority of the race blindly worshiped their queens with devotion. They served as the Demon Night's spiritual symbols after all, far higher than the Board of Elders.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the threat of impeachment had no teeth against Yao.</p>

  <p>The elders continued to protest loudly in front of the gate, annoying Enzo greatly. He was doing his best to restrain the killing intent in his heart with all the whining these old fools were doing.</p>

  <p>These old fools were all world lords, after all, and a few of them had once been grand world lords. They once served as the Demon Night's backbone but were now simply waiting for death to claim them after living in this world for too long.</p>

  <p>They were no longer the formidable pillars they had once been in their prime. Time had come and eroded the strength they once had in their bodies.</p>

  <p>Still, the prestige and respect they carried were no joke. These old warriors represented the seventy-two major clans of their race. If Enzo killed one of them, it was possible that he would unknowingly start a domino of unnecessary trouble.</p>

  <p>He had to deal with them here in a peaceful manner, for Yao's sake. He knew these old fools would never dare to charge into the Heavenly Punishment Palace forcefully.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the protest, a silhouette quietly appeared in the center of the palace. This newcomer was a tall man clad in a long, plain robe held together by a python patterned jade belt.</p>

  <p>"My queen," he addressed Yao but did not bow to her.</p>

  <p>Yao smiled at him cordially atop her throne. "Gunter, what's wrong?" she asked the Demon Night Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>There weren't a lot of Supreme Lords in their race. They only had four so far. This was taking into account the hundreds of supreme worlds and countless sacred places that the Demon Night occupied. Supreme Lord Leroy was able to obtain the Crown of Destiny with the help of Xun and her clansmen.</p>

  <p>This did not mean that the Demon Night was weak, but only 128 creatures were given the privilege to bear the Heavenly Destiny. No matter how gifted a newcomer was, he or she could not ascend the role if all positions had been filled up.</p>

  <p>It did not matter how talented warriors were. Without the Crown of Destiny, they would never be able to break through.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Gunter was one of Yao's supporters and his presence here made her nervous.</p>

  <p>Did he come here for the exact same reason those elders that currently protested at her gates had? Was he here to dissuade her?</p>

  <p>That might be troublesome if that was the case. Supreme Lord Gunter's suggestion would be something she could not set aside so easily.</p>

  <p>However, his next words made her heave a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"The heavens trembled," he said.</p>

  <p>"The heavens trembled?" Yao repeated and a trace of ruthlessness appeared on her exquisite face.</p>

  <p>She was not a Supreme Lord and did not bear the Heavenly Destiny, so she could not feel the vibration of the heavens.</p>

  <p> </p>
