  <p>
</p>

  <p>Bright, twinkling stars floated above the four mountain leaders' heads, and they couldn't help but look at them in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What are these stars?"</p>

  <p>"They seem to come from some Other Shore Token. I can feel their aura!"</p>

  <p>"Why is an Other Shore Token here?"</p>

  <p>While the four mountain leaders were quite confused, Elizabeth, Micah, and Bagot all gazed at the stars with shock.</p>

  <p>"It's the Starlight Witness," Elizabeth whispered. A warrior like Emperor Charm didn't usually engage in battles even once for tens of thousands of years.</p>

  <p>That was why nobody knew about his Starlight Tracking Spear, although he had owned it for thousands of years already. Only the closest people to him knew about it, such as Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Thus, they knew that Emperor Charm had already arrived in the Bloom Divine Province when the starlight appeared.</p>

  <p>After a while of being amazed at the starlight, the four mountain leaders quickly became cautious.</p>

  <p>They were all old warriors that had lived for many years, so their innate fighting instincts told them that those stars weren't as simple as they seemed.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, lots of Other Shore Tokens had strange abilities, and any negligence on their part might lead to their doom.</p>

  <p>"No matter what they are, do protect yourselves!" the leader of the Azure Mountain declared as he beat his chest hard.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A flurry of thunderstorms materialized and enveloped him entirely.</p>

  <p>The thunderstorms spread to a radius of a thousand feet around him and formed an absolute energy zone. It destroyed anything that passed through its area.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Ivory Mountain brandished his sword, and then sword shadows appeared continuously. Countless sword shadows grew rapidly like weeds and tightly wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Bright Mountain and the Golden Mountain also followed suit and used their own methods to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>Because of the starlight, the masters who had been chasing the Bearing race stopped for the time being.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race temporarily had a chance to breathe, but they were confused. They didn't know why the Oneness Sky Palace suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a square-shaped object appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Something had crossed the space and moved above the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Mountain had already been covered by the Cage of Heaven and Earth. Even powerful masters like Auden and Micah couldn't use the Grand Teleportation. After all, there weren't many people in the world who could completely ignore the Cage of Heaven and Earth.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The square shook as a blurry dark figure appeared. The figure looked like it had a pair of wings that were several hundred feet wide, and an azure spear.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Just as the figure came into view, it also instantly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The next moment, everyone saw that the blurry figure had rushed towards the leader of the Azure Mountain.</p>

  <p>Alas, his thunderstorms that could tear anything apart couldn't do anything to stop it.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the leader of the Azure Mountain felt an extremely powerful aura, and instinctively thought that he would die.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The azure spear pierced through his body.</p>

  <p>When the tip of the spear penetrated his body, he only felt that it took away everything he had. His strength, soul, consciousness, will, and spirit no longer belonged to him.</p>

  <p>The azure spear didn't stop after it pierced through the leader of the Azure Mountain.</p>

  <p>Before the blurry figure pulled out the tip of the spear from his body, it weirdly disappeared. Then, it stabbed the body of the Ivory Mountain's leader next.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>It penetrated, disappeared, and appeared...</p>

  <p>In the next second, the spear skewered the leader of the Golden Mountain.</p>

  <p>The four leaders died in succession.</p>

  <p>However, none of the dead leaders nor the others noticed the order of killing.</p>

  <p>They only saw four azure spear lights flash and pierce through the bodies of the four leaders at the same time. After the four leaders had died, the figure with huge wings appeared again.</p>

  <p>Only then did they see its face. It was Emperor Charm of the Sun Crow race!</p>

  <p>Hancock and his companions cried out desperately as they ran for their lives. When they finally saw Emperor Charm, they felt a glimmer of hope amidst a crisis.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm!"</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm of the Sun Crow race is here in person!"</p>

  <p>"Thank heavens! We're finally saved!"</p>

  <p>Of course, the people of the Oneness Sky Palace were worried and in a state of panic.</p>

  <p>There was no one who could fight Emperor Charm except for Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>If they were well prepared, the leaders of the six mountains might be able to fight him.</p>

  <p>Yet, Emperor Charm acted quickly and swiftly killed the leaders of four mountains just now.</p>

  <p>Although there were many powerful warriors present, who could fight him head-on?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Emperor Charm floated in the air. As he slowly spread out his wings, a golden disk shadow appeared behind him. It was the faith object of the Sun Crow race, the sun totem.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>All the members of the Sun Crow race knelt when the sun totem came to light.</p>

  <p>It was their rule that had existed for countless years, and they couldn't disobey it.</p>

  <p>The members of the Sun Crow race, such as Elizabeth, Micah, and Bagot, also felt their legs tremble and were about to bend down when they saw the golden sun shadow.</p>

  <p>But their instincts restricted them.</p>

  <p>All of the people of the Sun Crow race suffered. Their bodies convulsed as their instincts fought with their limbs.</p>

  <p>In the end, they didn't kneel. Their instincts had gained the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Disappointment was written all over Emperor Charm's face when he saw Elizabeth, Micah, and the rest of them float in the air motionlessly.</p>

  <p>Micah, Bagot, and the other members of the Sun Crow race were silent.</p>

  <p>They didn't betray Emperor Charm, but the one in front of them.</p>

  <p>When Emperor Charm received no answers, he didn't force them.</p>

  <p>He raised his azure spear horizontally, and starlight spread throughout the sky once again.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>This time, seven rays of starlight appeared above the heads of the seven powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The people of the Oneness Sky Palace were still not over the deaths of the four mountain leaders.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they clearly knew that the starlight above their heads would kill them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When a member of the Ivory Mountain saw the starlight above his head, his face paled, and he impulsively ran away.</p>

  <p>The other six did the same. They either used a secret technique to strengthen themselves or chose to escape.</p>

  <p>While they were fleeing, Emperor Charm raised the heavy azure spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Everyone saw the spear stab all seven of them at the same time.</p>

  <p>Such a killing method was powerful and overbearing, almost irresistible.</p>

  <p>The people of the Oneness Sky Palace felt desolate. They were like a group of helpless lambs, unable to do anything to Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm, who had killed the seven people, flew back up the sky once again. He held his azure spear indifferently and chose his next target.</p>
