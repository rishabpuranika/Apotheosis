<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From the top of the Heavenly Eye Vine, the leader of the Arrow Demons squinted at the three figures in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Jade Bone Arrows that spiraled in the air resembled vultures circling over their prey.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons were unwilling to give the Bone Fragments Secret Soul to the Gear race. The plan was once the members of the Gear race brought back the targets, they'd let the Jade Bone Arrows rain.</p>

  <p>The Jade Bone Arrows were deadly. There was no way the targets or the members of the Gear race would come out of this alive.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons had lived with the Heavenly Eye Vine for so long.</p>

  <p>They not only relied on their powerful archery skills for survival, but also their ruthlessness.</p>

  <p>However, the three members of the Gear race didn't make a move after they entered the center. The one in the lead suddenly raised his head and announced, "We just swallowed the Exploding Fire Essence."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the leader and the other Arrow Demons were all stunned.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. As long as we're unhurt, they won't explode," he added.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons and the Heavenly Eye Vine trembled in fear. They were most afraid of the Exploding Fire Essence. If they set off the explosion of the Exploding Fire Essence, they would be doomed.</p>

  <p>The three members of the Gear race eyed the Arrow Demons in the distance warily. When they were sure that they were in the clear, they began to look for Zheng's shadow.</p>

  <p>It was clear to them that although Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Snake Goddess bore the marks of the Element Spirit Civilization, the main target was that giant human.</p>

  <p>Orange lights flashed in their palms. Together, they grabbed at Zheng's shadow which was projected on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Pear Hill, Gerald was rapidly infusing life energy into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>As the Chaos Ancient God in charge of the life truth, his life energy was the strongest. It was easy for him to extract it through his bloodline, providing a steady supply of life energy for Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, it still cost Gerald quite a lot just to revive Zheng.</p>

  <p>From an old man, Zheng suddenly reverted to being middle aged, then gradually, he returned to his youthful self. Around ninety percent of his life energy had been replenished when suddenly, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he collapsed to the ground.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Why did he faint?"</p>

  <p>"He has been pulled to the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess said once she figured it out.</p>

  <p>"Let's go there too," Fuxi suggested, his eyes flashing with anger.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," the Snake Goddess said, holding up her hand to stop him.</p>

  <p>Everyone was well aware of the situation on the Other Shore. The Arrow Demons were not going to let them go. Not only would they be unable to help Zheng, if they rashly returned to the Other Shore, they might even cause more trouble for him.</p>

  <p>In the Grand Pure Realm, the three members of the Gear race were all stunned to see Zheng have almost completely recovered.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons and the Heavenly Eye Vine were also surprised.</p>

  <p>The amount of Zheng's life energy that had been consumed was astronomical.</p>

  <p>How was it possible he recovered so quickly?</p>

  <p>Zheng locked eyes with the three members of the Gear race who trembled before him. With a shrug, Zheng smiled at them. "You never learn your lesson.</p>

  <p>Why do you always help those whom you shouldn't have helped?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Leave!"</p>

  <p>The three members of the Gear race, immediately realizing something was wrong, attempted to retreat quickly.</p>

  <p>Zheng, of course, wasn't planning on letting them go that easily.</p>

  <p>Planting his foot firmly on the ground, he launched himself towards them, racing towards them like a bull. In the blink of an eye, he had pounced on the last member of the Gear race, pinning him to the ground.</p>

  <p>When the other two members realized what had happened, they pressed onward with no hesitation. In their eyes, Zheng killing their companion bought them some time to get away.</p>

  <p>But to their horror, when they looked back, Zheng had stomped on their companion's head, and was already heading towards them.</p>

  <p>In two strides, Zheng already caught up to the other two.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng drew an arc in the air. Using only his palm, he sliced the heads off of the two members of the Gear race. Their heads rolled on the ground, their expressions frozen in fear. A few moments later, their lifeless bodies collapsed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>While this was happening, the Heavenly Eye Vine, along with the Arrow Demons, had fled quickly.</p>

  <p>"Those liars! They didn't swallow the Exploding Fire Essence!" the leader of the Arrow Demons roared angrily.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, they were putting distance between them and Zheng; on the other, they were so afraid that the Exploding Fire Essence would be activated, so they immediately took off. To their surprise, even with the three members of the Gear race dead, there were no explosions.</p>

  <p>"Well then..." The leader of the Arrow Demons suddenly let out a long roar.</p>

  <p>The Jade Bone Arrows that had been circling in the air all suddenly shot towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, under Zheng's feet, many sharp thorny vines broke through the soil and wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>Those Jade Bone Arrows were unable to pierce through Zheng's tough skin and became blunt. However, the Feather Ghosts that were attached to the arrows drilled into his body one after another.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please offer your black jade bones!"</p>

  <p>There weren't many black jade bones left for the Arrow Demons, but they had no other choice at the moment. They had to take Zheng down at any cost, or they would be doomed.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine also knew this. It continued wrapping its branches around Zheng, layer by layer.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng just calmly shook his body slightly, breaking off all the thorns. He raised his arms fiercely, breaking off the vines as he did.</p>

  <p>As soon as the vines fell to the ground, a volley of Jade Bone Arrows showered over him.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons were desperate. For some, giving up their last black jade bone meant death, yet they still offered it to their companions. They were willing to sacrifice themselves to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>With countless Jade Bone Arrows attacking Zheng, it took a toll on his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng began to age quickly.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, from the Pear Hill, everyone could see what was happening. Immediately, Gerald leaped into action and extended a pair of pincers, replenishing Zheng's life energy once more.</p>

  <p>More and more Arrow Demons fell as they offered their last arrows, while Gerald consumed the power of life truth.</p>

  <p>Under the rain of arrows, Zheng flew up to the nearest vine and grabbed it.</p>

  <p>Clasping the vine in both hands, he shook it violently. The small Arrow Demons all fell to the ground. Swiftly, Zheng squashed them all with just one finger.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons could only put up a fight from afar using their archery skills, as face-to-face combat proved fatal to them.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed the thick Heavenly Eye Vine all the way to the top till he finally faced the leader of the Arrow Demons.</p>

  <p>"Why... Why is your life energy inexhaustible?" the leader asked in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>Desperately, he looked at Zheng with pleading yet disbelieving eyes. On his way up, Zheng had already been pierced by around five hundred Jade Bone Arrows, yet he still glowed youthfully. Such a feat was inconceivable.</p>
