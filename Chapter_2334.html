<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2334 The Orange Light Ball </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng went all out to strike, consuming almost ninety-nine percent of his strength source.</p>

  <p>The nine stars within his inner world dimmed rapidly.</p>

  <p>Most of the creatures in his inner world had no clue what happened— only the Evil God looked up and muttered, "The Creator is fighting a powerful opponent again…"</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang…</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon's broken arm with Aleyna and Nelly in its grip fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>The True Gods who saw it widened their eyes in shock.</p>

  <p>These Abyss Demons had astonishing defensive power— every True God was well aware of it. Though they had used their most powerful killing method, they couldn't cause any substantial damage to any of the Abyss Demons. Some of the low-rank True Gods' attacks couldn't even leave a single trace on their bodies.</p>

  <p>When Tianxing launched a full attack, he had actually cut off an Abyss Demon's arm.</p>

  <p>Just how powerful was this guy's attack?</p>

  <p>If even the Abyss Demon couldn't withstand that blow, then who else among the True Gods present could?</p>

  <p>Although one of its arms was cut off, Aleyna and Nelly were still in danger.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon's flame sword missed its target and tried chopping Aleyna's and Nelly's heads right off again.</p>

  <p>Having used up most of his strength source, Zheng could no longer burst out any power. It was too difficult for him to drag Aleyna and Nelly out from the Abyss Demon's hand.</p>

  <p>But Pascal, standing beside them, took action. He clenched his fist until a light golden fist shadow was formed.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The first shadow began rapidly spinning and rushed towards the Abyss Demon's broken arm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the other side, the top-rank True God of the Mu Clan condensed some energy in his hands and heavily pulled back. An invisible wind was formed out of thin air, wrapping around Aleyna and Nelly, dragging them toward the top-rank True God. By this pull, the two, along with the broken arm, were moved for about forty or fifty feet.</p>

  <p>Crack…</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon's sword came down right then, but rather slowly.</p>

  <p>Finally, its sword landed on the ground and triggered a crack— it lit up with a blazing flame, as though it was an entrance right to hell.</p>

  <p>"Withdraw!"</p>

  <p>Because the girls had been rescued from the Abyss Demon, everyone quickly distanced themselves from it and Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>The strike had consumed ninety-nine percent of Zheng's strength— he could no longer reach a high speed by relying on bursts of his strength source.</p>

  <p>But it was still no problem for him to distance himself from the Abyss Demon.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God of the Mu Clan stretched out his hand, trying to pull Nelly out of the Abyss Demon's broken arm, but it was all in vain.</p>

  <p>The Mu Clan's top-rank True God frowned before seizing a corner of the broken arm and pulling the two girls away.</p>

  <p>"I'm leaving now. If I stay here any longer, I'll only be courting death…"</p>

  <p>"Run! Run away from the Star Door!"</p>

  <p>Realizing that the situation wasn't getting any better, some True Gods rushed to the Star Door below the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>But most of them didn't run away and only kept a certain distance from the Abyss Demons.</p>

  <p>Although these Abyss Demons were tough and mighty, there were only four of them in the end. The only weapons they used to attack were the huge, flaming swords in their hands. If these fellows weren't bursting out so suddenly, they weren't actually as scary as everyone imagined.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang…</p>

  <p>Four Abyss Demons waved the enormous flaming swords in their hands and charged right at the True Gods, who constantly dodged, relying only on their reflexes.</p>

  <p>Half a minute later…</p>

  <p>The golden light being emitted from the surface of the Abyss Demons' bodies gradually dissipated and their speed slowed down.</p>

  <p>"The golden light disappeared!"</p>

  <p>"I knew that the golden light wouldn't last long. Everybody, go!"</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>In the midst of their fleeing, the True Gods heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Although the Abyss Demons were powerful, once they started slowing down, they posed no real threat.</p>

  <p>"Frost explosion!"</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of ice crystals smashed into the Abyss Demons like a heavy downpour of rain while the white frost floated in the air, layers upon layers.</p>

  <p>"All things grow!"</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Thick vines sprouted from the ground and quickly wrapped around the legs of all the Abyss Demons.</p>

  <p>All sorts of methods were exerted on the Abyss Demons, restricting their movements.</p>

  <p>Under the previous siege of the True Gods, the four Abyss Demons had already been put in a difficult position. After losing the golden light's protection, they were unable to resist the True Gods' attacks.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A huge crack suddenly appeared on the waist of one of the Abyss Demons— its huge body lost balance until its upper half was cut all the way off, falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Finally, we finished one!"</p>

  <p>"The Abyss Demons are too powerful— it isn't easy even for a consummate True God to kill one…"</p>

  <p>"But somehow, we managed it! Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Thanks to everyone's cooperation, they had killed such a powerful monster, filling everyone with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Another Abyss Demon roared desperately.</p>

  <p>Before it died, the Abyss Demon began inserting its flaming sword into the ground, kneeling down on one knee with its head bowed. Then, it ceased to move.</p>

  <p>The remaining two Abyss Demons ended in a similar way.</p>

  <p>Just as Soren had said, these Abyss Demons were puppets made up of fiends' bones. It was extremely difficult to destroy them all, but after a certain number of attacks, they were finally paralyzed.</p>

  <p>None of the Abyss Demons could move. Glancing at each other, the True Gods' eyes once again glowed with a fiery light.</p>

  <p>"What's our reward for killing these Abyss Demons?"</p>

  <p>"Will we get tons of divine might coins?"</p>

  <p>"If there are only a few supreme treasures of belief, how should we divide them?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, many of the low-rank True Gods were at a loss.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the top-rank True Gods quietly approached the Abyss Demons— getting rewarded was also on their mind.</p>

  <p>Even the first or second-level supreme treasures of belief were incomparably precious.</p>

  <p>If four supreme treasures of belief really came out of killing four Abyss Demons, they didn't even need to guard the Goddess Statue anymore. A fierce battle for the treasures would probably erupt, every single True God becoming an enemy.</p>

  <p>Through long social practices, these rich clans had some established rules, preventing them from fighting each other in the forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>But with the real benefits before them, the rules meant nothing to them.</p>

  <p>Normally, everyone obeyed the rules, knowing that if they violated them, they would suffer great losses. But once the possible profit they could gain totally outweighed their potential losses, the so-called rules became mere empty words.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>The four giant swords inserted into the ground suddenly burst into blazing flames, devouring the Abyss Demons' bodies.</p>

  <p>An invisible heatwave then spread in ripples within the area.</p>

  <p>Those True Gods did not retreat, however, they continued instead to approach the Abyss Demons, facing the heatwave head-on. The looks in their eyes grew even more vigilant.</p>

  <p>They were no longer wary of the Abyss Demons, but of the other True Gods.</p>

  <p>Standing by quietly was Zheng, calmly watching the flames. It would take some time for his strength source to recover, so he couldn't participate in the fight over the treasures.</p>

  <p>When the Abyss Demons' bodies were burnt out, the flames gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>"Nothing?" Zheng raised his brows slightly in surprise.</p>

  <p>"What the hell? There isn't even a single divine might coin?"</p>

  <p>"My brother has lost his life for nothing…"</p>

  <p>"Alas, if the Abyss Demons left their bones behind, they would still be worth quite an amount of money. It's such a pity that they were burned!"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demons' bones were taken from real 'fiends' after all. Even the top-rank True Gods couldn't break them. Their bones alone were extremely valuable. But unfortunately, they were nothing but ashes now.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" One of the True Gods suddenly piped in.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to the ashes and saw that they began glowing with some kind of orange light.</p>

  <p>A top-rank True God was extremely fast— before the others could even react, he jumped up, reached into the ashes, and grabbed the orange ball of light. Ecstasy seemed to come over his face, but as soon as he caught the ball, a miserable scream escaped his mouth. He threw it back quickly, but half of his hand was already charred.</p>
