<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1865 War Within The Inner World.  </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Earlier, there was no need for Zheng to pay enough attention to his inner world. He never interfered in the operations of his inner world.</p>

  <p>Depending on the level of one's cultivation, there was difference in the time flow rate in each one's inner world.</p>

  <p>When a warrior had just stepped into the Soul Sea Realm and formed their Soul Sea, the time within was more or less inactive.</p>

  <p>That was the reason why the Soul Sea Realm warrior could not nurture life. The process took very long.</p>

  <p>But after reaching the Spirit Supreme Realm, the time flow rate in one's inner world started to increase at a considerable rate. Life vitality started to turn into a continent, and the lowest level of creatures were soon born and developed.</p>

  <p>The higher the cultivation level, the faster the time flow rate in one's inner world would be.</p>

  <p>Hence a world lord's inner world was much more prosperous than the inner world of a warrior of Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was not aware that the speed of his inner world was even faster and everything in his inner world kept evolving at every moment.</p>

  <p>Soon he discovered that there was something wrong within his inner world and he was shocked at what he saw.</p>

  <p>Above the central continent of the chaotic sea, a relatively primitive civilization had begun to develop, and there was already a large-scale war!</p>

  <p>Zheng's consciousness had already slipped into his inner world, and with a thought, took on the shape of an avatar.</p>

  <p>In this world, Zheng was the most high god, the absolute controller!</p>

  <p>Although this inner world was still at the most basic stage, it was quite vast for Zheng once he entered into it.</p>

  <p>With a thought, his avatar flashed and appeared on this continent.</p>

  <p>He did not have to use the Grand Teleportation or the Space Law. He could appear anywhere he wanted with just a thought.</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>"Kill the imbeciles of Totem Clan!"</p>

  <p>"All for the glory of Howe Clan!"</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>In his own inner world, Zheng could not only be anywhere at any time, but also knew everything.</p>

  <p>Zheng was in true sense an omniscient figure.</p>

  <p>It seemed that all the large and small races born in this continent merged and eventually formed two large clans.</p>

  <p>The clan formed in the east was the Howe Clan and the one formed in the west was the Totem Clan.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, both the clans showed considerable strength. Apart from minor conflicts, there never had been a large-scale war between them.</p>

  <p>However, recently, Totem Clan started making great progress. Warriors of their clan had obtained a very powerful weapon; a long spear made from a dark green plant.</p>

  <p>What was extraordinary about this spear was that, when in use, countless vines would extend from the spear and pierce into the arms of the warriors. Because of this, Totem Clan remained invincible.</p>

  <p>After they gained this impassable strength, they waged a war with the Howe Clan.</p>

  <p>Even though the Howe Clan's strength had weakened considerably, they gathered their remaining 50, 000 warriors and launched their final counterattack. They wanted to protect their clan at all costs.</p>

  <p>"Those are very strange weapons they have in possession." Standing at the edge of the battlefield, Zheng had also noticed the peculiar spears in the hands of the Totem Clan warriors.</p>

  <p>With a flick of thoughts he presumed the source of these weapons He turned his head and gazed past the endless distance. Soon his vision landed on the World Tree.</p>

  <p>The World Tree that Zheng had planted in this world had grown to a prodigious tree, and on this tree, a race had also formed. This race had a similar appearance to humans, but their skins were dark green in color.</p>

  <p>The spears were made and given by those green skinned people to the Totem Clan.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly smiled when he understood the root of all these waging wars. There always were struggles where people were involved. But he did not expect his inner world to be so corrupted.</p>

  <p>The main aim of the green-skinned habitats of the World Tree was to destroy all the lives on the continent and rule over it.</p>

  <p>Normally, Zheng would not interfere in the things happening in his inner world. But now, things had gone out of control. This would lead to stagnant expansion and development of the inner world.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly approached the battlefield.</p>

  <p>On the battlefield, the warriors of the Howe Clan were riding huge elephants and charging towards Totem Clan.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the Howe Clan remained unbeatable through these mammoth sized war elephants.</p>

  <p>But now, after gaining the long spears, Totem Clan became stronger. The spear was so sharp and powerful, that it could pierce through even the strongest elephant!</p>

  <p>The Totem Clan regarded this war as a reason to massacre the entire clan. And the Howe Clan, regarded it just like a moth was attracted to a flame. They were willing to give up their lives to defend their clans.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>A spear pierced the chest of one of the war elephants. It let out a painful cry as its huge body collapsed to the side.</p>

  <p>And the one who was riding this elephant was a woman.</p>

  <p>The Howe Clan was a matriarchal clan, and this woman was the queen of the Howe Clan.</p>

  <p>All her soldiers had been slaughtered, and in the final battle, she herself entered the war.</p>

  <p>With the war elephant, the queen also fell to the ground. Her skin tore through the sharp stones and rocks leading to excruciating pain. The queen who possessed remarkable strength and beauty at one time was currently in a pitiful state.</p>

  <p>Her hopes were completely dashed.</p>

  <p>She had fought bravely, but was no match to those spears. Her people would be captured as slaves and her territories would be taken over by the Totem Clan.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A green spear was already at the queen's neck.</p>

  <p>The man holding the long spear was the great general of the Totem Clan.</p>

  <p>The general smiled and said, "Surrender now! There is nothing left to fight for! As the queen of the Howe Clan, you can be our slave. Our king will spare your life for your service!"</p>

  <p>"In your dreams, general!"</p>

  <p>The queen struggled to her feet and immediately drew out a long sword from the ground behind her.</p>

  <p>But before she could swing it, the green spear knocked away her sword with a light flick.</p>

  <p>"There is no point in struggling now," the general said flatly.</p>

  <p>"My people... they are still struggling. As their queen, I will not give up!"</p>

  <p>The queen twisted her nimble body and went around the spear to pounce on the general. However, the general grabbed her hair and pulled her off the ground.</p>

  <p>"This is all that is left of you! Only your life is remaining to give up!"</p>

  <p>The general was still sneering at the queen, when he suddenly saw a person approaching towards them.</p>

  <p>It was a young man in strange clothes.</p>

  <p>The man ignored the war raging around him and walked towards them.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" The general asked coldly, while pointing the spear towards the man.</p>

  <p>He ignored the general's question and continued to walk.</p>

  <p>"Come any closer and you will surely die!" The general shouted at him.</p>

  <p>The queen was also aware of the extraordinary character of the man. But she could not do much under the general's firm grip.</p>

  <p>As Zheng got closer and closer, the general lost his patience. He threw the long spear, aiming at Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not even flinch. Instead, he allowed the spear to pierce him!</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>A smug look appeared on the general's face. This green spear contained unimaginable power. It would definitely pierce through the enemy's head, killing him on the spot!</p>

  <p>But soon, the general's face froze as he saw an unbelievable sight.</p>

  <p>The moment the tip of the spear touched the man's forehead, it splintered and broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>As soon as the spear broke, the broken pieces remained suspended in air and fused back together to its original form. But the end of the spear was still in the possession of the man.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was fiddling with the spear, countless vines shot out and tried to pierce through his arms. But in vain, as they could not penetrate through his skin.</p>

  <p>"Interesting that such a fascinating weapon could be produced from the World Tree."</p>

  <p>With a flick of his hand, the spear turned into a brown colored gas and vanished completely, without leaving any trace.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you? What have you come here for?"</p>

  <p>The general had never seen such a miraculous sight before. He panicked as he threw the queen to one side and fled!</p>

  <p>The queen landed on the ground and turned around, staring at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept over the queen. When he finally saw her appearance, he was completely stunned.</p>

  <p>No wonder he heard that there were people who fell in love with the creatures in their inner world.</p>

  <p>Everything in this inner world was in a chaotic state. Among the countless living beings, such a beautiful woman had been born.</p>

  <p>"You... Who are you?"</p>

  <p>The queen asked the general's question again. After all, Zheng's actions and behavior were far beyond their imagination. Only the gods possessed such an ability.</p>
