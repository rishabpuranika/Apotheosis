<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1378 Sixteen Thousand Miles </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The leader of the Shadow Palace sighed. "It seems that the warriors of the Mist Palace are performing very well this year."</p>

  <p>The other palace leaders were also speechless. They didn't know where and how the Mist Palace had found such remarkable talents. It seemed that these three warriors could easily break the record� a distance of fourteen thousand miles!</p>

  <p>Yolande was still calm.</p>

  <p>Yolande thought that Luo Zheng had much greater potential than this. He could achieve far greater things.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the old man in cotton clothes spoke, "Luo Zheng and Javier are warriors who ascended from the Lower World, right?"</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>The old man dressed in cotton clothes chuckled and said, "It looks like we got another miracle from the warriors of the Lower World..."</p>

  <p>This so-called miracle of the warriors, who had ascended to the Upper World, was just a concept that circulated in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Over the years, there had been many warriors who had ascended from the Lower World, but most of them were just ordinary warriors with ordinary abilities.</p>

  <p>This was also pretty normal. Generally, the cultivation methods, inheritances, and resources of a supreme world were much superior to those of the Lower World.</p>

  <p>So all those who had ascended from the Lower World were always amazed at what they saw in the Upper World. However, some of them had managed to surprise everyone with their skills and strength after they ascended.</p>

  <p>For instance, Supreme Lord Illusion's great talent surprised all of the members of the whole alliance before. After becoming a Supreme Lord, he became one of the most outstanding Supreme Lords ever.</p>

  <p>"A miracle of the warriors from the Lower World... Can it really be called a miracle?" A palace leader shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying that they might be able to break the record of Supreme Lord Illusion?" another palace leader asked.</p>

  <p>The old record of eighteen thousand miles was difficult enough to beat and not even the most talented warriors of thirteen palaces could even dream to break it.</p>

  <p>In the previous Passing the Torch, no warrior then had the ability to break this record.</p>

  <p>The old man dressed in cotton clothes only chuckled and didn't say anything more.</p>

  <p>In the Enchanted Barrier Tower, Layla didn't stay any longer. She was like a jubilant skylark, just freely flying through the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>Now that she was sure that Luo Zheng was following her, she didn't need to wait any longer. She wanted to leave him as far behind as possible.</p>

  <p>Layla's flying speed had now increased by double. No matter how crazy the Law Storm was, it was unable to hinder her agile figure.</p>

  <p>Javier, meanwhile, was exhausted.</p>

  <p>Javier had already cultivated in seclusion before he joined the Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was brought into the Mist Palace by Yolande not long after he ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, Javier had experienced a lot of hardships after flying into the Upper World. His remarkable talent was what brought him to Yolande.</p>

  <p>After that, he successfully entered the Mist Palace with the help of Yolande.</p>

  <p>He found out about the story of Supreme Lord Illusion there!</p>

  <p>He knew that those who ascended to the Upper World could also achieve supreme achievements and become a Supreme Lord to be admired by the living creatures in the universe.</p>

  <p>When they were in the Lower World, Javier had met Yolande during a crisis. Yolande had offered him help and even trained him to become one of the most powerful warriors in the great world.</p>

  <p>When he had already achieved his goal, he sought for Yolande. However, he discovered that she was only a clone that had already returned to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>When he found out about this, he decided to follow her. He didn't want to give up looking for Yolande even though he knew Yolande didn't necessarily like him.</p>

  <p>He just wanted to prove to her that he could become a great warrior too just like Supreme Lord Illusion.</p>

  <p>But now, the Law Storm was becoming stronger and stronger. The wounds on his body were becoming increasingly severe. Both his legs and arms were so seriously injured that his bone was already protruding.</p>

  <p>He relied on his strong willpower to be able to make it through for now.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he was still in third place. His speed didn't increase, and he also didn't slow down!</p>

  <p>As he kept moving into the depths of the Law Storm, he saw more beauty of it.</p>

  <p>Along the way, for example, he saw the purple ice crystals that regularly formed strange lines on the ground. These lines were all completely natural but they contained the very unique Law Power.</p>

  <p>He also saw the terrace-like pools where the purple liquid flowed, but if one looked carefully, one would see that the liquid was actually caused by the lightning.</p>

  <p>Of course, among these magnificent layers hid danger. If Luo Zheng wasn't careful, then the Law Power would pounce right at him.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was advancing, there was a violent roar that came from the front.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked over and saw a figure.</p>

  <p>Javier?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't really know Javier, but he knew that he was the warrior that ranked first in the Swallow Cloud House. He also said something strange when Yolande used the Red Cloud Ring to select warriors.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be pursuing Yolande.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng walked in, he found Javier's body entangled among the golden vines. He was struggling, trying to break free from the vines. He looked like he was having difficulty breathing and his body was covered in wounds. He looked miserable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned to see Javier struggle like that. He exhaled a deep breath to calm himself down.</p>

  <p>While these golden vines were not living creatures, they were formed by the Wood Law. No matter how hard Javier struggled, he wouldn't be able to break free from these vines.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure flashed as he hovered in the air. He then asked, "Do you need help?"</p>

  <p>Javier had been struggling for quite a while and he still hadn't been able to get rid of the golden vines. Suddenly, he heard Luo Zheng. He glared back at him, "No!"</p>

  <p>"But you can't escape these vines on your own," Luo Zheng said, lowering his head. He knew that there were some warriors who had strange tempers, so he asked Javier first instead of helping him right away. The more talented a warrior was, the more temperamental he was.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Javier suddenly raised his head and stared at Luo Zheng. He looked crazily at him as he said, "What I want is to prove my strength, so I don't need your help."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng smirked. "Are you doing this for Yolande?"</p>

  <p>"You... Why are you calling her by her first name?" Javier said in a cold voice, his face indignant.</p>

  <p>Yolande held a high position in Mist Palace. Normally, the young talented warriors would address Yolande as "Master" and none of them dared to call her by her name alone.</p>

  <p>But Javier called Yolande by her name because he had met Yolande in the Lower World before. In addition to that, he had always felt that he was special to Yolande. Besides, Yolande didn't care what they called her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly and said, "Is it that strange? You aren't the only one who met Yolande in a great world..."</p>

  <p>"You're also a warrior from the Lower World, and you..." Javier had cultivated in isolation in order to take part in the Passing the Torch, so he didn't know anything about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Before Javier could even finish speaking, Luo Zheng nodded his head and said,</p>

  <p>"That's right, Yolande has so many clones so you're not the only one she's encountered."</p>

  <p>Javier was silent upon hearing this and he didn't look so indignant anymore.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued, "I know you want to prove yourself to Yolande but you seem to have made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"What mistake?" Javier said coldly.</p>

  <p>"The Yolande you like isn't the same Yolande you are meeting now...</p>

  <p>The clone is not the main body after all. After Yolande devours the clone, it will disappear from this world...</p>

  <p>So you don't need to prove anything to the current Yolande."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't a relationship expert but since Javier had ascended to the Upper World like he did, he didn't mind saying stuff like this to him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the atmosphere outside the Enchanted Barrier Tower became awkward.</p>

  <p>Even Yolande, who normally kept a straight face, had a strange expression. The rest of the palace leaders were knowingly eyeing Yolande.</p>

  <p>As for the old man in cotton clothes, he chuckled and said, "Now these young warriors are very strange and interesting. I can't believe they can manage to talk about things like that in the middle of this Law Storm!"</p>

  <p>Javier was calm upon hearing what Luo Zheng had said. Luo Zheng shook his head as if he thought there was no use persuading Javier anymore. He just wanted to tell Javier what he thought. To Yolande, her clones were just trivial memories. She couldn't possibly reciprocate Javier's affection.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished speaking, he didn't linger anymore and continued moving forward. It was up to Javier if he was going to accept it or not.</p>

  <p>As they got distracted by Luo Zheng and Javier, everyone quickly turned their attention to Layla who had already traveled over sixteen thousand miles.</p>

  <p>She was only two thousand miles away from Supreme Lord Illusion's record. However, as she reached this, it was increasingly becoming difficult to move forward.</p>
