  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing this voice, Nathaniel turned around to see Luo Zheng. "What did you just say?"</p>

  <p>Nathaniel grinned ear to ear. He wouldn't take a low-rank True God like Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>He had entered the Time Sea Forbidden Land countless times, and as he went on, he came across warriors from the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands, and he took their lives without hesitation.</p>

  <p>He had even killed some of the Holy Emperors' disciples and descendants. The wealthy clans on the Floating Islands kept their mouths shut to keep themselves off his list of victims.</p>

  <p>When Nathaniel picked up Luo Zheng's divine might coins, he took it for granted, because with his strength, he could have killed these Poisonous Wolf Scorpions as easily as Luo Zheng had, maybe even more efficiently.</p>

  <p>He felt that Luo Zheng did not have the qualifications to kill the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions like this.</p>

  <p>The low-rank True Gods huddled up under the Goddess Statue, carefully hunting the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions while the mid-rank True Gods stayed a little far away from the statue. Only the top-rank True Gods could enter the crowd of the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions and kill them without any scruple. Because of this, the top-rank True Gods obtained the most divine might coins among the crowds of people.</p>

  <p>How did this guy manage to kill the scorpions like a top-rank True God?</p>

  <p>Nathaniel could definitely gain a foothold among the top-rank True Gods, though he wasn't one. In the Arena of Legends, while going against top-rank True Gods, he had been able to win seven consecutive matches. This showed his strength and versatility which surprised most.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods were more or less displeased too when they saw what Luo Zheng was doing.</p>

  <p>He took their divine might coins as he was very effective in killing the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions.</p>

  <p>But they knew that Luo Zheng relied on his own ability and courage, so they didn't dare say anything against him.</p>

  <p>However, what Nathaniel did was somewhat straightforward and surprising to everyone. He completely took away all of Luo Zheng's divine might coins, giving Luo Zheng a warning to not get them back. If Luo Zheng resisted, Nathaniel would have to teach him a lesson.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng remained silent and just let Nathaniel take them. Nathaniel thought it would stay that way, but Luo Zheng couldn't hold his tongue long.</p>

  <p>"You took all my divine might coins. Are you going to leave like this?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>The corners of Nathaniel's mouth twisted into a small grin. "It's really a joke," he expressed. "As I've said, the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions you killed belonged to me. You should be relieved that I haven't planned to get you in trouble after you killed my scorpions. So now, do you still have the balls to ask me for coins?"</p>

  <p>It was well known that the people of the Dongfang Clan were very domineering, and Nathaniel was no exception to this. Many elites of the influential clans on the Floating Islands, who were present, stayed silent as they listened intently to the two's conversation.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Reginald was annoyed as he always was. He casually killed some Poisonous Wolf Scorpions and shouted, "Nathaniel, these beasts don't belong to anyone. According to the past rules, whoever kills them will obtain them. You're breaking a ton of rules right now."</p>

  <p>In the process of killing the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, all of the True Gods were restrained and there was no scramble.</p>

  <p>A muffled laughter arose from behind Reginald. "Rules? Are you really going to talk about rules with the Dongfang Clan? A little naive of you to say, Reginald."</p>

  <p>Reginald's expression darkened. He turned his head towards Soren.</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

  <p>As everyone knew, Soren was a top-rank True God from the Dongfang Clan. He had long limbs, and his body was as thin as a bamboo pole.</p>

  <p>This was the first time he'd spoken since they started. "Do you really take yourself as the leader of the group?" Soren asked sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Because Reginald was able to successfully distract the Time Ghosts, this allowed him to lead the group forwards. Right now, everyone followed his orders without another word, but the other top-rank True Gods might have not taken him as seriously as the rest.</p>

  <p>"For the record, I have never thought of myself as a leader," Reginald pointed out. "It's just that while exploring in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, we should be united. It will be easier to travel in a group than individually." The other True Gods, including many top-rank True Gods, nodded in agreement as they heard his words. At the very least, Reginald had selflessly contributed a Star Door, which gave a way for anyone to retreat if they wished to.</p>

  <p>"I'm not targeting you, but you'd better stay out of the Dongfang Clan's business," Soren hissed. "If those two little guys want to rip each other's heads off and make a scene, even I wouldn't bother to intervene."</p>

  <p>His words immediately struck a blow at Reginald, warning him to just leave Luo Zheng and Nathaniel alone.</p>

  <p>Reginald wanted to argue but decided against it. Because Soren said so, he realized that he didn't have any reason to meddle in the first place. In fact, he wasn't afraid of Soren, but he didn't want to make a scene.</p>

  <p>The thing was, Luo Zheng had saved his life before. He knew the characters of the people from the Dongfang Clan, and that these guys were merciless? killing anyone who went against them. What if Nathaniel killed Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>After thinking over his options, he turned to Luo Zheng. "Buddy, I will make up for the divine might coins that Nathaniel has taken away from you," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Reginald had also obtained a lot of divine might coins. Thus, it wasn't a big deal for him to give the coins to Luo Zheng. Moreover, he knew he still had many more opportunities to redeem himself and gain more coins.</p>

  <p>He thought his idea was brilliant and Luo Zheng would agree without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Reginald."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and cupped his hands in a gesture of gratitude. "I appreciate your kindness." Afterwards, he turned his head and glared at Nathaniel who stood before him. "This dog has been tailing me the whole time to profit himself. It's time he paid me back with interest," he mocked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words made Nathaniel's blood boil. No one had ever dared to mock him like that, and he burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"You? Hahaha... You must have been born outside of the Floating Islands, or you wouldn't be such an idiot. Do you know who I am? I guess I'll just have to show you."</p>

  <p>Nathaniel was still speaking, but Luo Zheng cut him off immediately.</p>

  <p>Just then, his eyes flashed with a sharp light within them. As he stood on the ground, his tiptoe tapped on the ground, and an invisible wave of energy burst forth against Nathaniel. He turned into a gust of wind and came in front of Nathaniel. "The only thing one can learn from you is how to talk shit," he scoffed. "But I don't want to learn that."</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved extremely quick. It took only a few seconds for him to suddenly shift from a standstill to an outburst of force.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Nathaniel didn't expect that Luo Zheng would attack him at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng went for it without hesitation and knocked his elbow across Nathaniel's jaw.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The impact and pain were far beyond what Nathaniel expected.</p>

  <p>As the force surged across his body, all he could do was stare at Luo Zheng in shock. His body kept retreating, rolling down to the ground.</p>

  <p>Though he was confident enough, Nathaniel knew that Luo Zheng's strength was out of this world. Moreover, Luo Zheng had also practiced Thunderstorm Godly Way and Five Elements Godly Way, so he never doubted Luo Zheng's capabilities even for a second.</p>

  <p>In Nathaniel's eyes, such a cultivation base was excellent, but that was all Luo Zheng had to offer.</p>

  <p>He knew that it was no big deal compared to his own abilities.</p>

  <p>From ancient times until the present day, only a few mid-rank True Gods had been able to fight off top-rank True Gods in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>Only a few had been able to win themselves a spot. Nathaniel was one of them.</p>

  <p>As a mid-rank True God capable of fighting top-rank True Gods, he was conceited and figured he could take down Luo Zheng like killing a bug.</p>

  <p>"How dare you attack me..." Nathaniel roared and leaped up on his feet.</p>

  <p>Just then, a thick layer of earthy yellow light emerged on the surface of his body: an internal momentum from the Earth Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Standing still, he saw a shadow flash in front of him. But to his surprise, Luo Zheng approached him again and gave him a punch to the head.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's punch was extremely powerful, Earth Godly Way's defense was astonishing as it was. Because of Nathaniel's power, the energy released from Luo Zheng's punch merely spread under the yellow light from Nathaniel's body and immediately passed to the ground under Nathaniel's feet.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The ground around Nathaniel began to crickle and crackle as it split apart.</p>

  <p>People began to shriek as the ground of the whole valley was shaking.</p>

  <p>The power of the punch spread out and was absorbed by the ground, which caused a minuscule earthquake that no one was expecting.</p>

  <p>This ability was similar to the power transfer Luo Zheng possessed in the universe. As long as Nathaniel was in contact with the ground, he possessed an indestructible defensive power against Luo Zheng. He had to get him off the land immediately.</p>

  <p>"You're all force and hits," said Nathaniel. "It's getting really boring." He laughed to himself.</p>

  <p>Blood red flashes began to appear across Luo Zheng's eyes, showing that a fierce killing intent was emitting from his body!</p>

  <p>"The Murdering Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Nelly, who stood far in the distance, stepped forward and gave Luo Zheng a firm look. Her eyes spoke wonders, giving off anger and caution with just her expression. If that bloke really used the Murdering Godly Way, he would definitely be the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Luo Zheng didn't have much to worry about.</p>

  <p>"Blood Breaking Bite!"</p>

  <p>Just then, a blood snake suddenly sprang out from Luo Zheng's hand and slithered towards Nathaniel. It ignored the Earth Godly Way's internal momentum on Nathaniel's body, biting a small wound in his neck.</p>

  <p>Before Nathaniel could react, Luo Zheng threw out another punch across his face.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a smacking sound, Nathaniel was tossed three thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>Lucky for him, the Earth Godly Way made sure that this punch was still unable to hurt him.</p>

  <p>However, scarlet blood began spewing out from his neck, pulling out a blood band three thousand feet long in the valley. It looked striking and frankly, terrifying.</p>
