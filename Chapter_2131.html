  <p>
</p>

  <p>Master Evil had never thought that he would meet Luo Luo Zheng in the Misty Mountain Village! A displeased expression came across Master Evil's face.</p>

  <p>The Swirl Forest was not far from their location, but it was still three regions away. Master Evil thought that he probably had some bad karma to coincidentally run into Luo Luo Zheng in this small mountain village in the northern part of the Vast Sky Region. He could not tell how he felt, and could only accept that he and Luo Luo Zheng were fated to meet.</p>

  <p>Other than Bromley and a few other Holy Beings, Luo Luo Zheng was probably the last person Master Evil wanted to see.</p>

  <p>To leave the dungeon, Master Evil had accepted an extremely unfair inner demon oath to Luo Luo Zheng that he would do precisely as Luo Luo Zheng asked. If he disobeyed Luo Luo Zheng, he would be attacked by the oath! A heavy gulp was made by Master Evil as he remembered the oath.</p>

  <p>After he had managed to leave the dungeon, Master Evil naturally wished to achieve more in the Divine Dao. With an insatiable thirst for power, he wanted to cultivate more to improve his strength. He was already at the peak of the mid-rank True God which meant that as long as he took one more step, he would be able to become a top-rank True God. At that time, his strength and position would be on a whole new level. Even if the Holy Beings wanted to make a move against him, they would be wary of him.</p>

  <p>With a strong desire to keep his life, Master Evil definitely wouldn't violate his inner demon oath. As soon as he heard what Luo Luo Zheng said from behind, Master Evil's body instantly stiffened. He then slowly turned his head, and chuckled, "I did, of course I recognized you."</p>

  <p>"Good," Luo Luo Zheng uttered and nodded his head. With an indifferent face, Luo Luo Zheng casually said, "Since you still remember me, you can stay here today. I have something that I need your help with."</p>

  <p>The leader of the Sun Moon Village and his subordinates, who stood beside Master Evil, were instantly dumbfounded. A curious expression painted their faces as they witnessed how obedient Master Evil's reaction was. Master Evil had a high reputation in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Who was the proving godly warrior from the Misty Mountain Village?</p>

  <p>How dare he speak to Master Evil in such a manner!</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Master Evil did not get angry nor annoyed. Instead, he gave a pleasant laugh, which made it even harder for them to think straight. He was just belittled by the proving godly warrior. How could he be so calm?</p>

  <p>"It's okay if you need my help, but I've only just returned to the Vast Sky Region. There is a thing that I want to take away, and it just so happen to be buried under the Misty Mountain Village. Can you ask these villagers to retreat first?" Master Evil stated with a calm tone. His gentle face didn't reflect his true emotions. In his eyes, the divine citizens were as humble as ants. However, since Luo Luo Zheng was here, he had to get his permission first.</p>

  <p>When the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village saw that Master Evil had personally come, they were naturally frightened. Cold sweat trickled down their spines as they witnessed his arrival. To them, Master Evil was a legendary evil god. In the Vast Sky Region, if a child behaved badly, some adults would use his existence to scare the child. They would often say, "If you don't behave well, Master Evil would come and capture you!" A simple sentence like that would be enough to silence a baby in tears.</p>

  <p>How could the villagers still be alive even after a legendary evil god had already arrived in their village? Fortunately, most of the divine citizens of the Misty Mountain Village had already moved away. At the same time, the ones that fled let out a sigh of relief in their hiding place. Even though they had to leave their home, they were still able to survive.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, they also feared for the safety of those who remained.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Luo Zheng had promised, the divine citizens that remained were still unharmed. They hadn't expected that Master Evil would be so polite to Luo Luo Zheng. In fact, Master Evil did not appear evil at all.</p>

  <p>After they had witnessed such a peaceful scene, the villagers were even more surprised and began to speculate about where Luo Luo Zheng came from.</p>

  <p>Since Master Evil had made such a request, Luo Luo Zheng discussed it with the divine citizens that still remained in the village.</p>

  <p>Master Evil's intention was not to chase away those divine citizens of the Misty Mountain Village. All he wanted was to take away the thing buried there. As such, the divine citizens didn't have to be so against him.</p>

  <p>Thus, the divine citizens that still remained finally left the Misty Mountain Village. After some time, they met and joined the majority of the divine citizens who chose to hide. Master Evil ordered the leader of the Sun Moon Village to lead a group of warriors to guard outside. It was only until then that he and Luo Luo Zheng entered the village.</p>

  <p>"This mountain was once called 'Black Wind Ridge', one of my old nests. Back then, the Black Wind Ridge was renowned throughout the entire Vast Sky Region. However it has now become a place no one knows about," Master Evil sighed while he shook his head.</p>

  <p>He had established seventy-two villages in the past. However, a disappointed look appeared in his face because only three of them were left. Furthermore, after so many years, everything had changed. Back here, whenever he reminisced, he felt bad. Nonetheless, there was no one to talk to.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed silently behind Master Evil. As he heard Master Evil's story, a smile shone across Luo Zheng's face. "A True God's lifespan is limitless. As such, you would only lose a little time, Master Evil. To a True God like you, time is probably the most worthless thing, right? As long as you spend some time, everything can be reconstructed. It's easy for you to make a comeback." he comforted Master Evil with a gentle and heartfelt tone.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng finished his remark, Master Evil's body paused for a moment. He turned his head and looked deeply at Luo Luo Zheng. With a low yet sorrowful voice, he said, "You're right, but the environment of the divine land is constantly changing. I wonder if there is an opportunity like that..."</p>

  <p>Master Evil just became a mid-rank True God back then. Additionally, it had been extremely difficult for him to dominate the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>However, the two major powers of the Vast Sky Region were in conflict back then. Both of the two mighty groups only focused on the war. They had no time to pay attention to the northern parts of the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>As such, Master Evil's influence continued to grow without much trouble.</p>

  <p>Such an opportunity would be hard to find in their current situation.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Luo Luo Zheng gave a faint smile. A hint of expectation shone across his eyes as he uttered confidently, "Actually, there seems to be a greater chance to achieve such a thing now. Can you not see it?"</p>

  <p>"A greater chance? What do you mean?" Master Evil was startled. With curious eyes, he stared at Luo Luo Zheng for a while. A light flashed through his eyes and he suddenly began to breathe faster.</p>

  <p>After their recent encounters, he was already aware that Luo Luo Zheng was Bromley's disciple as well as Mike's son.</p>

  <p>Although the Vast Sky Region was just a small region within the divine land, Master Evil had heard about certain rumors. He was aware of the affairs on the Floating Islands. Additionally, he also knew about the disputes between those Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was cautious about Luo Zheng's presence in the divine land. Luo Luo Zheng must have had some grand plan since he even took the effort to step in this place. With the support of two Holy Beings, Master Evil believed that Luo Luo Zheng could rise to prominence as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>If he could follow Luo Luo Zheng, it would indeed be a great opportunity for Master Evil.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no..." Master Evil immediately denied the idea as he frantically shook his head like a rattle drum.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was indeed the inheritor of the two Holy Beings. However, Bromley had already disappeared for many divine eras. Whether he was alive or dead could be also a question. Additionally, Mike was already on the verge of death!</p>

  <p>To make matters worse, Luo Zheng's opponents were Murphy and the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The opportunity was not small, but the risk was just too great. Estelle was qualified to be involved. However he, Master Evil, could only become a pile of cannon fodder if he were to participate. With his current strength, he would be no match to those powerful creatures.</p>

  <p>As he saw Master Evil's reluctant reaction, Luo Luo Zheng lightly said, "A True God's lifespan is indeed limitless, but are you really willing to go through such a long time in mediocrity?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil laughed loudly. With a shameless voice, he replied, "That's better than death!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil knew that Luo Luo Zheng had unlimited potential. It would be possible for him to become a top-rank True God. The achievement of such a goal was easily within his grasp. With his abilities, Luo Luo Zheng could even be a consummate True God in the future.</p>

  <p>However, not everyone dared to fight against those Holy Beings! A battle with such powerful creatures could only be a hellish nightmare.</p>

  <p>Since Master Evil was reluctant to join him, Luo Luo Zheng did not force the matter anymore. All Luo Luo Zheng needed Master Evil to do was to help him settle down in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After they had entered the center of the Misty Mountain Village, Master Evil became restless. He stretched out his hand and slapped the ground left and right. As he searched for a certain object, his head almost touched the ground.</p>

  <p>Some time had passed for their search. Finally, Master Evil confirmed a spot. Then, he walked a few steps to the side and suddenly slapped the ground with his hand.</p>

  <p>Immediately, a massive divine texture appeared in his hand! An intense expression was revealed in Master Evil's face as he saw the divine texture.</p>

  <p>Without any delay, the divine texture turned into a giant arrow, and then the arrow slowly crawled on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Click! Click!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a muffled sound came from underneath the Misty Mountain Village. Metals and heavy stones were heard to collide with one another. It seemed that a huge mechanism had been opened deep underground.</p>

  <p>An expression of euphoria appeared on Master Evil's face. Expectant eyes and a cheerful smile revealed his happiness about the discovery.</p>

  <p>The Sealing Machine that he set before was still effective. It only meant that in the years that he had been gone, no one had been able to get their hands on the thing that he had hidden underneath.</p>

  <p>However, when he opened the Sealing Machine, a powerful Mu Ning suddenly erupted from one of the buildings in the Misty Mountain Village. Both Luo Luo Zheng and Master Evil immediately raised their guards. At the same time, a burst of arrogant laughter resounded, "Ha-ha, Master Evil, you're finally back! I've been waiting for you for seven divine eras!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Master Evil heard the voice, his face immediately changed.</p>

  <p>The previous joyful expression he displayed had suddenly disappeared!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows creased with curiosity.</p>
