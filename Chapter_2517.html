  <p>
</p>

  <p>"How could this be..."</p>

  <p>Since the moment Nicholas had crashed into the ground, Lorena had been on high alert.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Zheng was leaping over hurdle after hurdle on his way to becoming a top-rank True God. She couldn't believe she had been complacent enough to have exposed herself like this, at this time.</p>

  <p>'How could I have been so careless!' she thought.</p>

  <p>The space she had created over the years with the help of the nether power was independent and separated from the outside world.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the last time Luo Zheng had entered the underground, only one layer of the space had been connected to the outside.</p>

  <p>However, now Harold and Luo Zheng were here, she had not separated the space from the outside at all.</p>

  <p>The divine land was not just a very large ship. It was, in fact, enormous.</p>

  <p>In Lorena's opinion, it was impossible for the enemies to monitor and police the entire divine land all the time.</p>

  <p>But she was wrong. This was the complacence that had gotten her in trouble.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, hadn't noticed any change in his mother.</p>

  <p>There were other things on his mind. In his inner world, he was still concentrating on transforming the Spiritual Darkness to form his own Godly Tile...</p>

  <p>The avatar that had formed from Lorena's thoughts was staring at Luo Zheng in silence. She was trying her utmost to keep calm on the surface, but in fact, her mind was in chaos.</p>

  <p>'I, I must keep them out...' Lorena thought to herself.</p>

  <p>The real Lorena, however, still in the cave, was ready to make her move.</p>

  <p>She patted her hands gently, and a force began spreading out from them.</p>

  <p>Cracks formed under her feet...</p>

  <p>As the cracks spread quickly along the floor of the cave, the stones on its perimeter began to break too. Soon, the giant beasts that had been sealed within the stones for thousands of years were finally released, one by one.</p>

  <p>The stone spirits climbed out of their stones, and slowly traipsed towards the entrance of another nearby cave.</p>

  <p>The power of these spirits was great: they were not much weaker than Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>But that was only true of their physical strength.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Holy Beings were so invincible was that they had more than just physical strength.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the stone spirits were still far from being on a par with the Holy Beings, or even Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>One could not rely on the stone spirits to defeat Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Nicholas dived, following the passages dug by Harold. A black fireball was spinning in his hand.</p>

  <p>Whether it was ordinary soil, the gangue layer or the layer of flint, everything that encountered the fireball melted like ice and snow.</p>

  <p>Thus, as Nicholas descended, the path ahead widened.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings behind him just needed to follow him.</p>

  <p>"It seems that someone has been here before us."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what Nicholas is looking for underground..."</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but what I do know is that there is nothing good in the depths of the underground of the divine land."</p>

  <p>There was nothing special in the depths under the divine land. This was the common consensus among those in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The creatures that were able to survive in the gangue layer were extremely rare, let alone those that could thrive in the layer of flint. As for the layer of soft stone, no living being in existence could adapt to it.</p>

  <p>It was completely uninhabitable.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the large clans on the Floating Islands and the other True Gods rarely, if ever, explored the underground.</p>

  <p>"We will soon pass the layer of flint, and after that comes the layer of soft stone. Will Nicholas continue to descend?" a Holy Being said, his voice tinged with worry.</p>

  <p>The layer of soft stone was very thin, And just below it flowed the Lethal Fire Magma. Whoever broke the soft stone layer would come in contact with it, which was invariably fatal. Even Holy Beings would be consumed by it, sucked into its fiery depths, never to be seen again.</p>

  <p>No one wanted to follow Nicholas and risk being swallowed by the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas was already standing on the layer of flint.</p>

  <p>He stood there, hesitating for a moment, and then raised his right hand.</p>

  <p>Streaks of space fluctuations circled around his fingers.</p>

  <p>Then, he tapped one of his fingers on the air in front of him.</p>

  <p>The ripples of space spread in all directions, like chaotic scattered winds.</p>

  <p>Even though the layer of flint was extremely hard, it was still vulnerable to being torn apart by the space fluctuations. Cracks began to appear in it, one after another.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes flickered. He let his eyes wonder for a while, until he fixed his gaze in one direction. A smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>A cave had appeared behind one of the cracks.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he walked towards that cave.</p>

  <p>"There even is a cave here?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were shocked too. It turned out that Nicholas had come here just for the cave.</p>

  <p>As Nicholas entered the cave, the other Holy Beings followed suit, apprehensive, but curious.</p>

  <p>A surprise was in store for them inside the cave, however. As they approached the entrance of the cave, a group of stone spirits rushed out.</p>

  <p>The stone spirits stood towering above them, their arms almost the same length as their bodies. Although they moved slowly and clumsily, their power was not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, however, did not seem surprised to see the stone spirits.</p>

  <p>"Kill them," he said brazenly.</p>

  <p>"I really didn't imagine that such strange things lived under the ground," said Clark with a laugh. He looked excited. He stepped out, and it seemed as though flames were dancing around his body.</p>

  <p>As for the other Holy Beings, they also employed their own special skills.</p>

  <p>None of the Holy Beings used weapons to fight against creatures of this level. They were not even near strong enough to merit the fear of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Various kinds of energy erupted within the cave all at once.</p>

  <p>Physically powerful as they were, the stone spirits could not withstand even a single blow from these Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Nicholas did not even bother to make a move. His figure flashed in the cave and he teleported himself forwards, completely ignoring the attack attempts from the stone spirits.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the end of the cave, he carefully examined the traces on the wall.</p>

  <p>"Here!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he had touched the wall of the cave with his hand, an invisible space fluctuation tore it apart, giving way to another cave. Of course, this cave was also filled with stone spirits.</p>

  <p>When Lorena had traveled through these caves with Luo Zheng, they had left cracks behind them. Most of those cracks had disappeared, but they had left behind traces and scars.</p>

  <p>Following these traces, Nicholas moved forward in this new, complex cave. The Holy Beings that followed him had come to kill the stone spirits.</p>

  <p>"They are coming too fast..."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lorena, who remained at the bottom of the cave, frowned.</p>

  <p>With so many Holy Beings coming together, she would be overwhelmed by sheer numbers.</p>

  <p>Although she still had an advantage in the divine land, now was not the time to use it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still absorbing the Spiritual Darkness with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Oblivious, he didn't know how close his mother was to desperation, nor did he know that danger was approaching fast.</p>

  <p>As time ticked by, her eyes filled more and more with despair.</p>

  <p>Consumed with anguish, she realized that she had no choice but do the only thing she knew would work in this situation.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, I'm sorry..."</p>

  <p>She stared at Luo Zheng with a complex expression on her face, sad but resolved. It seemed that she had made up her mind to take a gamble.</p>

  <p>She raised her finger gently, and a small purple jade plate appeared in her hand. A purple circle of light shot out from the jade plate and completely enveloped Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lorena's movements were precise and extremely subtle. Luo Zheng, all his attention focused on his inner world and his avatar, didn't notice a thing.</p>

  <p>A strong space fluctuation shot out from the purple circle of light shrouding Luo Zheng's body. Then, the fluctuation suddenly formed a whirlpool, and Luo Zheng disappeared into nothingness.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Lorena stood up, a smile on her face, a beautiful, but sad and desperate smile. She reached out and gently flicked her fingers.</p>

  <p>The center of the cave cracked, and a stream of cyan magma poured out from it. It was the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>
