  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked even though he knew how enormous the chaos was.</p>

  <p>But if a beast's bone was larger than the divine land, how huge must the giant beasts have been when alive?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also seen huge creatures in the universe.</p>

  <p>For example, the Ancestral Dragon was thousands of miles long in its complete form.</p>

  <p>A few of the giant beasts even reached ten thousand or even a hundred thousand miles in length.</p>

  <p>But these giant beasts at the bottom of the chaos might be several hundred million miles long. How powerful might such creatures be?</p>

  <p>How had they perished and fallen down to the bottom of the chaos?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze swept over the bones and saw that they were piled in disorder.</p>

  <p>They extended into far distance, and were blocked by the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The number of giant beasts that had died there was probably far beyond Luo Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what's hidden at the bottom of the chaos, but if the divine land? the 'ship' really falls down, the living beings in the divine land will surely be annihilated!"</p>

  <p>If such a huge divine land smashed into the chaos, it would cause a huge vibration before disassembling.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the divine land, on the other hand, could sense the ground cracking and the mountains collapsing.</p>

  <p>And in this process, ninety percent of creatures would be destroyed, with only a portion of the powerful ones being able enough to survive.</p>

  <p>Once the divine land broke, the chaotic energy would surge in madly.</p>

  <p>The poison of the chaotic energy would destroy the remaining creatures, and in the end, only a few dozens of the Holy Beings would be able to survive.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, once the divine land was broken, the universes attached to the divine land, which were also the inner worlds of Holy Beings, would also be affected. The universes would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Murphy and Nicholas would also probably be affected, but Luo Zheng had no idea how they would deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>"At such a speed, the divine land will probably crash in less than ten years. No wonder Harold thinks that this is of such importance!"</p>

  <p>Ten years was just a blink of an eye to the True Gods.</p>

  <p>"But how can I control the direction of the divine land?" Luo Zheng pondered, frowning slightly.</p>

  <p>Harper hadn't given Luo Zheng any advice. He had only told him that he would gain all the knowledge he needed once he entered the sun.</p>

  <p>Since the divine land was also a ship, there was probably something like a helm that could control it.</p>

  <p>But the rings were the only things that could be used in this palace.</p>

  <p>He had worn these rings, but besides gaining a broader vision, he didn't seem to find anything special. Controlling the direction of the divine land wasn't even an option.</p>

  <p>"There must be some secret to these rings!"</p>

  <p>Four rings were around his hands and feet.</p>

  <p>As he remembered this, Luo Zheng immediately closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>His soul trembled, beginning to release his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Like the tentacles of an octopus, the spiritual sense began to spread out towards the four rings.</p>

  <p>When it touched the rings, they began to tremble, buzzing incessantly.</p>

  <p>"They are absorbing my spiritual sense!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, shocked.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, he felt that the four rings seemed to have integrated with him.</p>

  <p>The four rings seemed to have transformed into parts of his body, a fact that made him queasy.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to move his arm, and lowered his right arm.</p>

  <p>The moment he moved his arm, the front end of the divine land, which was over a trillion miles long, began to sink.</p>

  <p>The divine land had been diving at a certain angle, and because of Luo Zheng's movement, it tilted even more greatly.</p>

  <p>At the same time, all the living beings in the divine land felt the tremors caused by the tilting of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The shock wasn't great, but it was obvious what had caused it.</p>

  <p>In the Sunrest Tree Region, Yan stood on tiptoe at the edge of the tree as thick as an arm, looking up at the sky.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, all traces of the sun disappeared from the edge of the Sunrest Tree Region and took her brother, Luo Zheng, to the other side of the chaos.</p>

  <p>It was now night in the Sunrest Tree Region and they could only see the stars in the sky.</p>

  <p>Although the Sun-resisting Umbrella was protecting her brother, Yan was still worried.</p>

  <p>Even Holy Beings were prone to being burnt to ashes by the Sun Essence Flame in such a hot place. Her brother, on the other hand, was just a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>But in this moment, she suddenly felt a faint vibration spreading out of the tip of the tree.</p>

  <p>She leaned forward, her body sliding onto a thin branch before she could control her movements.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?"</p>

  <p>Yan said, blinking in shock.</p>

  <p>Harold appeared on the tree trunk behind her, a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Harold, what was that power?" Yan asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The tilt had been slight but it had been unusually smooth, which meant that the power had had an influence over a large range. It had influenced the entire Sunrest Tree, causing it to lean over.</p>

  <p>"It was just the divine land tilting," Harold laughed. "It means Luo Zheng has succeeded!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng made it?" Yan asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>Harold nodded and said, "But he seems to be going in the wrong direction."</p>

  <p>Yan was facing west on the divine land. If the land tilted in this direction, it would fall faster.</p>

  <p>"Why is he going in the wrong direction?" Yan asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Maybe... Maybe he is exploring at the moment," Harold answered.</p>

  <p>The majority of the people in the divine land sensed this tilt, but most of them didn't take it seriously.</p>

  <p>Only a very small number of people understood that just a moment ago, the divine land had tilted at a great angle. But since everyone was in the divine land, they hadn't felt it too clearly.</p>

  <p>Some people were ecstatic and realized that someone was manipulating the direction of the divine land, in a bid to save the divine land.</p>

  <p>But some of them looked sullen. They had plotted for a long time, but now, Luo Zheng's actions had destroyed their plans. They were furious and dejected.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't thinking all this as he was in the palace.</p>

  <p>"Looks like these rings can control the direction of the divine land's flight!"</p>

  <p>The front of the divine land had tilted dangerously when he had lowered his right hand.</p>

  <p>So Luo Zheng gently lifted his right hand, and the ring that surrounded his right hand floated upwards.</p>

  <p>This gesture caused the front of the divine land to lift and tilt upwards.</p>

  <p>"It's done!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered excitedly.</p>

  <p>But the moment he lifted his hand, Luo Zheng realized that something was wrong. The divine land had only risen upward on one side. The other side remained tilted.</p>

  <p>He took some time figuring out the rules, and then slowly raised his left hand.</p>

  <p>The divine land had changed its direction completely, but it still maintained its fall.</p>

  <p>The divine land was, after all, a huge place and it had great inertia as it fell.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to completely change the situation in such a short period of time. But if it kept going at the present pace, the crash could eventually be avoided.</p>
