  <p>
</p>

  <p>The four powerful creatures didn't quite expect that the energy inside the bottle would be so feeble.</p>

  <p>"Huh. The aura of this energy is awfully weak."</p>

  <p>"Apparently, this is the aura of the Divine Dao. But is it really a Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, the aura is extremely unusual. Upon closer inspection, it doesn't belong to any of the three thousand Divine Dao. However, it does look like the aura of the Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>And even if their cultivation of a Divine Dao actually reached the peak level, they would merely acquire one divine megaton of force. Why on earth would they be interested in it?</p>

  <p>At any rate, they had been staying in the Supreme Pure Realm for such a long period of time. This meant that they weren't aware of the news circulating in the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, the Grandmaster of Heaven had never divulged any information regarding the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"I assure you, this is indeed the Divine Dao energy," the Grandmaster of Heaven stated frankly. He didn't want to beat around the bush.</p>

  <p>The four red spheres were rotating simultaneously. When they heard the Grandmaster of Heaven's confirmation, they exchanged meaningful glances.</p>

  <p>They paid a great price in order to capture the Treasure Bottle Platform.</p>

  <p>Despite that, all they got was the Divine Dao energy. They couldn't accept that this was it.</p>

  <p>They had a hard time wrapping their heads around it. Was the Grandmaster of Heaven insane? They all thought so. Why else would he choose to grab this?</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Grandmaster of Heaven always had the most accurate predictions. He even managed to help them escape from death countless times. Obviously, he would never do such a boring thing.</p>

  <p>"So what's the use of the Divine Dao energy anyway?" Phelps decided to go along with the Grandmaster of Heaven's train of thought. He might as well learn what his purpose was.</p>

  <p>"You are from the Other Shore. Therefore, you have never set foot in the chaos before. Ewing, go ahead and tell him what the use of the Divine Dao energy is," instructed the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>While Phelps was from the Other Shore, Ewing, on the other hand, was from a ruling civilization that existed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>When the Grandmaster of Heaven called his name, Ewing had an inscrutable expression on his face. "The Divine Dao energy helps one reach the consummation of True God Realm and subsequently break through to the Other Shore Realm," he answered.</p>

  <p>When Phelps, Sloan, and Larson heard his answer, they merely broke into laughter.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm was quite insignificant to them.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven slightly turned blue in the face as he restrained himself from reprimanding them. He turned around to face Ewing and asked, "Do your race not cultivate the Ways-blending Energy?"</p>

  <p>"Huh? The Ways-blending Energy? Why would we? Isn't it just a waste of time?" Ewing questioned. In his honest opinion, cultivating the Ways-blending Energy was far inferior to entering the Other Shore. As a matter of fact, most of the Other Shore Realm warriors had the same notion even until now.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven sighed and felt a bit frustrated. "The main reason why the Ways-blending Energy isn't that strong is that it has always been flawed. Remember, the six great truths are all derived from the Ways-blending Energy. The complete Ways-blending Energy is actually very powerful."</p>

  <p>Even as he tried to explain it, Phelps, Larson, and Sloan still didn't understand what he meant. After all, the three of them were from the Grand Plain Stage on the Other Shore. And there, they had almost no chance to learn about the concept of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, Ewing had a serious expression on his face. He felt like he had heard of this before.</p>

  <p>When he was still in the chaos, he didn't cultivate the Ways-blending Energy. However, his now deceased brother was very obsessed with it. His brother had actually spent a lot of time on it. Sadly, the final result was not good.</p>

  <p>Later on, his brother told him that the Ways-blending Energy was extremely powerful. The only drawback was it could be extremely difficult to blend the Divine Dao. More importantly, the energy was incomplete and defective.</p>

  <p>At that time, Ewing didn't take his brother's words seriously. He simply thought that he had failed in cultivating the Ways-blending Energy, so he just used it as an excuse to save face.</p>

  <p>What the Grandmaster of Heaven said strongly reminded him of what his brother also told him once before.</p>

  <p>"The complete Ways-blending Energy may be extraordinarily terrifying,"</p>

  <p>Ewing mumbled quietly. The words came out of his mouth as though from a long forgotten memory.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven smiled when he heard this. "That is precisely why I wanted to attack the Treasure Bottle Platform."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished talking, he took out a small bottle. "Collect!" he said to the pale yellow energy floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The bottle gave off such an attraction force.</p>

  <p>The pale yellow energy floated noiselessly in the air. Trapped in the treasure bottle for many chaotic eras, it had now become intelligent. It was struggling very hard to get out of that attraction force.</p>

  <p>However, it was too weak to resist it. Soon enough, it was sucked into the bottle.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, everyone heard a strange sound out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"Meow..."</p>

  <p>The meow was very soft. It was almost like a newborn kitten's cry.</p>

  <p>They could tell that the voice came from afar but it could be distinctly heard from all over the place.</p>

  <p>"Is there a kitten somewhere? I heard a meow," Stella asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>She had just thrown a giant's corpse into the Divine River. However, even the loud splash of the water was unable to cover up the meowing sound.</p>

  <p>Darby was a lot more sensitive than Stella was. Without warning, his spiritual sense had spread out and covered the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, he turned around and aimed at the northern area.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven brought out a wooden cork from his waist band. There were elegant runes carved on the cork. With it, he covered the mouth of the bottle and gently tapped the runes with his fingertips.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The runes on the cork flashed and firmly sealed the bottle.</p>

  <p>After that, the Grandmaster of Heaven raised his head and smiled at the void. "I have a question for you."</p>

  <p>He held the bottle firmly in his hand and shook it. The bottle had an interesting feature. It would change its color in accordance to the color of the thing inside it. Therefore, the elegant white porcelain bottle had now turned yellow.</p>

  <p>"Now that the Divine Dao energy has been successfully extracted, why should you not destroy it right away?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"Meow..."</p>

  <p>They heard another meow echoing through the entire area.</p>

  <p>"There may only be one truth," the Grandmaster of Heaven answered the question himself. "The energy of the entire chaos is constant. Even if you destroy this Divine Dao energy, it would just be reproduced somewhere else in the chaos. Is my speculation correct?"</p>

  <p>"Meow..."</p>

  <p>The meow had gotten even louder and much clearer.</p>

  <p>In an instant, they seemed to realize that it had a terrible magic power. As the sound faded away, everyone who heard it felt agonizing pain in their ears. It was almost as if they were actually getting clawed by a cat.</p>

  <p>"Ouch! That hurts!"</p>

  <p>Stella screamed and covered her ears with her hands.</p>

  <p>When he saw this, Darby turned his hand upward and a small golden bell appeared on his palm.</p>

  <p>He loved collecting treasures. He carried over a thousand of them with him all the time.</p>

  <p>He gently tossed it upwards. In the blink of an eye, the small bell turned into a big golden bell that covered him and Stella. At the same time, it kept chiming softly, which effectively alleviated the pain in their ears.</p>

  <p>Phelps, Larson, Ewing, and Sloan also used their own methods of protecting their ears from the shrill and piercing cries.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Grandmaster of Heaven remained standing still and made no effort to cover his ears. He merely stared toward the north.</p>

  <p>From the outside of the Treasure Bottle Platform, an enormous cat head slowly appeared. It had a white ball embedded on the top of it, which was filled with numerous eyeballs. They noticed that these were not illusory eyes, but real ones. Each and every one of them was connected by blood vessels in a very complex manner.</p>

  <p>This being was actually the leader of the Element Spirit Civilization, the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a booming voice came out of his body.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can easily get away with something that is not yours?" he asked them in an intimidating manner.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't the Treasure Bottle Platform be a trap? It could be just like what I did to those puny humans before?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think?"</p>

  <p>After the Eye Spirit finished talking, Phelps, Larson, Sloan, and Ewing felt ill at ease. Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven remained as calm as usual.</p>
