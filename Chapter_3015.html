<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could feel people staring at him as he retreated from the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>They envied Luo Zheng, a relatively new member of the Sword Light Palace, yet he was already allowed to see Qiu Yinhe alone.</p>

  <p>Not even the current head and elders received such treatment.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, come here," Laura said, gesturing for Luo Zheng to come closer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flew towards her.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the other palace leaders followed his tracks.</p>

  <p>"Well, what did Master Qiu Yinhe say to you?" Laura asked.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Luo Zheng responded, "He asked me to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>He said he would send someone to pick me up."</p>

  <p>"That's great!"</p>

  <p>All the people seemed happy, especially Ingram.</p>

  <p>He had made a mistake in the past that caused his removal from the Stinger Guards.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Sword Light Palace dictated that if he wanted to return, he had to make an achievement in the Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>However, he already lost his hope throughout the years. The situation in the Sword Dance Palace did not help at all. He would need a lot of time if he wanted to return.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had joined the Taiyi Heaven Palace as a new disciple of the Sword Dance Palace, full credit would go to Ingram.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be long before Ingram became a Stinger Guard again.</p>

  <p>The other palace leaders were jealous.</p>

  <p>They were all working hard to train their disciples, perhaps much more than Ingram. Ingram was known to just drink wine each day. He was just lucky to have Luo Zheng as a disciple, so they were not convinced at all.</p>

  <p>Historically, if the Sword Light Palace offered talented disciples to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the latter would give some rewards in return. Given Luo Zheng's Instant Enlightenment, the Taiyi Heaven Palace was expected to give the Sword Light Palace generous rewards.</p>

  <p>As soon as that happened, Ingram wouldn't just be able to return as a Stinger Guard, he would also be promoted far beyond other palace leaders.</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you the exact time?" Laura asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and replied, "No."</p>

  <p>The officiant cut in, "Laura, don't worry. It was Master Qiu Yinhe himself who promised they would pick up Luo Zheng. It shouldn't take long. In the past, we sent disciples ourselves."</p>

  <p>Laura nodded in agreement and tried to relax.</p>

  <p>Then, someone interrupted from the side of the platform, "Elgin has broken through his bottleneck!"</p>

  <p>"So has Beldene! Could they also comprehend the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent thoroughly?"</p>

  <p>Elgin and Beldene were enlightened after the Truth Competition with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After the lines on the Lofty Sword disappeared, they immediately went to verify what they had comprehended.</p>

  <p>While reciting, they advanced and broke through their bottlenecks almost at the same time until they reached consummation.</p>

  <p>If not for Luo Zheng joining the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Elgin's and Beldene's entries into the Sea of Truth should have been a great deal for the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Finally, they had understood the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. All they were waiting for was to go to the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Laura, they have just reached consummation," Dalton said hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"According to custom, we should give them soul pills before they go to the Sea of Truth."</p>

  <p>Charlene nodded. "Beldene, bring a soul pill with you before you go to the Sea of Truth," she reminded.</p>

  <p>The soul pill was a rare treasure in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>It could only be acquired from large forces and at a high price.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that the Sword Light Palace had the help of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. They could buy soul pills from the Taiyi Heaven Palace and at a much lower price.</p>

  <p>However, the Sword Light Palace did not have enough soul pills. The soul pills, after all, were used widely. They were used to cross the Sea of Truth, cultivate on the Other Shore, and the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm used them too.</p>

  <p>"We should also give Luo Zheng a soul pill," said Ingram.</p>

  <p>Almost no disciple from the Sword Dance Palace could go to the Sea of Truth, so he had forgotten this rule.</p>

  <p>Smiling faintly, Laura called Elgin and Beldene to Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>Laura drew out her right hand and then, suddenly, a black bottle appeared. It had an unusual shape and a figure of a strange-looking ghost was drawn on it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a lot of soul pills. He had only ever seen them in the Sea of Truth before, but never in the real world. "The bottle looks strange," he said upon seeing what was in Laura's hand.</p>

  <p>Elgin glanced at Luo Zheng and said, "You haven't even seen it before? This bottle is a soul bottle and the soul pills can only be contained inside it given their special nature. Otherwise, they will disappear in two or three days."</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could reply, Dalton interjected, "Elgin, don't be rude!"</p>

  <p>Elgin was showing off. He didn't like that Luo Zheng was outshining him.</p>

  <p>Dalton wasn't too happy about Luo Zheng either, but he knew very well that since Qiu Yinhe personally introduced Luo Zheng to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Luo Zheng would have a bright future. It wasn't wise for Elgin to offend Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Elgin didn't care. He only saw Luo Zheng as an outsider. He knew that he was a decent disciple of the Qiu Clan and had no reason to be afraid.</p>

  <p>But he dared not contradict Dalton.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't indulge in Elgin's games. He merely stared at the soul bottle.</p>

  <p>Laura gently rubbed the surface of the bottle. At once, three muffled sounds came out of it. Then three transparent bubbles followed, in which there were brown soul pills the size of a fist.</p>

  <p>"The soul pills are so large!" Luo Zheng said in shock. The soul pills were different from what he had seen before.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's shock, Beldene knew exactly what to ask. "Luo Zheng, did you encounter any soul pills in the Sea of Truth?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"That makes sense. The Sea of Truth and the Other Shore are located in a vast world. Things look different there. If I'm lucky enough to meet you in the Sea of Truth, do help me out. I'll need it," said Beldene curtly.</p>

  <p>"We are both the disciples of the Sword Light Palace. We should help each other," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Dalton admired Beldene's decorum. He glanced over at Elgin and sighed.</p>

  <p>Elgin was the more talented one between them, but he wouldn't go too far if he didn't know how to properly deal with the world.</p>
