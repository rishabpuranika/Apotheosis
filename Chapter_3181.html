<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was the foundation of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, it had a great influence on this orthodox human force.</p>

  <p>There was no way Qiu Yinhe, Goran and the others were not interested in the Truth Enlightenment, the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was very generous to offer 100 words for free. But this only made them hungry for more. They could only hope that Luo Zheng could actually write down all the words of the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Zheng had understood the stand of the Taiyi Heaven Palace? they were on Nine Li race's side. He was willing to stay here and even become a member of this human force. After all, the Nine Li race had no longer existed. Though he really wanted to rebuild the Nine Li race, not only was his strength not enough, but his influence was also very small.</p>

  <p>The Truth Enlightenment was an opportunity to garner the support he needed.</p>

  <p>"Masters, I've more than a hundred words," Luo Zheng said confidently.</p>

  <p>His answer immediately gave the four of them a surge of hope. If the Truth Enlightenment was completely deciphered, they would gain an excellent power releasing token.</p>

  <p>"How many words do you have?" Qiu Yinhe asked, his eyes shining eagerly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "150 words. The rest hasn't been deciphered yet."</p>

  <p>"There are one hundred and fifty words already!"</p>

  <p>"Did you decipher them yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Or did someone else decipher them?"</p>

  <p>They bombarded Luo Zheng with questions, unable to contain their excitement.</p>

  <p>With their status in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, it was rare for them to be so openly modest. After all, the Truth Enlightenment was valuable; it might even tip the scales in favor of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"I have deciphered them by myself, but the deciphering of the current 150 words is my limit. The other patterns of the Sanskrit words are too complicated. I have yet to decipher them," Luo Zheng replied calmly.</p>

  <p>He had already thought about this explanation.</p>

  <p>The Truth Enlightenment originally belonged to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and the palace treated Luo Zheng well. Sooner or later, he would hand over the complete deciphered version to the palace. However, before then, he needed to maximize this opportunity to benefit from it first.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng couldn't possibly admit to them that it was actually his son, Luo Nian, who had deciphered the words. Otherwise, they might pester him all day, and might even try to use some unknown method to get Luo Nian out of his inner world. No, it was too risky.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he decided to take the credit for everything. He could always tell them in the future, after Luo Nian left his inner world.</p>

  <p>The four of them exchanged glances dubiously. Somehow, they couldn't believe what Luo Zheng said. The translators of the Taiyi Heaven Palace needed to decipher Sanskrit words all day long. However, they'd never seen Luo Zheng do this; Luo Zheng usually just focused on cultivating.</p>

  <p>But the Truth Enlightenment was indeed provided by Luo Zheng. Whether it was deciphered by him or someone else, they needed to get it from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you sure you can decipher the rest of the Sanskrit words?"</p>

  <p>Winchell asked, concern written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said with a serious look, "Deciphering the Sanskrit words is a kind of thing that has much uncertainty, and I'm not a hundred percent sure if I can do it."</p>

  <p>He refused to give them assurance.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a look at the one hundred and fifty words?" Goran asked meekly.</p>

  <p>Any content of the Truth Enlightenment, even just a word, was worth a lot.</p>

  <p>"When I return to the Heart Flow Sect, I will write down the 150 words,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng promised. "If you want to have a look, please come straight to the Heart Flow Sect and take them."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was so generous that these four warriors felt somewhat embarrassed.</p>

  <p>They held high positions in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, yet here they were, practically begging their junior for something. Even though it might have been embarrassing, this was no small thing they were asking for; it was only natural they wanted to learn more.</p>

  <p>Goran thought for a while before saying, "The Truth Enlightenment is very rare. We can't take it in exchange for nothing. Well, you can make a request to each of us. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>The other three nodded in agreement. They were not greedy people. "Yes, you're right. Anything you need, just say it," said Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't refuse this offer. "Are there any Other Shore Treasures made of Shade Stones in the Taiyi Heaven Palace?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's request, the four of them exchanged looks of dismay.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Other Shore Treasures were rare treasures, but it wasn't difficult for them to obtain one or two of them. However, the Other Shore Treasures made of Shade Stones were different, because the Shade Stones were very rare.</p>

  <p>"I just gave you the Shade Phoenix Sword as the prize of the Seven Mountains Meeting. Do you still need another Other Shore Treasure made of the Shade Stone?" Goran scratched his chin, deep in thought. Then, it hit him? Luo Zheng didn't want the Other Shore Treasures, but the Shade Stones.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stones were too special. They could only be used to make weapons, and once a stone appeared, it couldn't be moved. Even if Luo Zheng wanted to find the Shade Stones, he could only look for the Other Shore Treasures made of them.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want the Shade Stones?" Qiu Yinhe looked at Luo Zheng, confused.</p>

  <p>He recalled how the Jin Wu went to battle with the Taiyi Heaven Palace for the Shade Stone back in the Blue Cloud City. Luo Zheng had been there too, but he was only there for the merit points.</p>

  <p>However, after the Shade Stone had been melted by the Su Clan, it was lost in the fight against Phoenix. Qiu Yinhe thought maybe the Shade Stone fell into Luo Zheng's hands. But even if Luo Zheng got the liquid of the Shade Stone, he couldn't utilize it without the Su Clan's weapon refining array.</p>

  <p>"I would like to use them for my cultivation. I would be very grateful if you could help me find them," Luo Zheng answered honestly.</p>

  <p>This was something that Luo Zheng knew he couldn't hide from them. Now that he had asked them to look for the Shade Stones for him, he knew he had to come clean.</p>

  <p>"What kind of cultivation method are you using? Why would it need the Shade Stones?" Goran asked, taken aback.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe had caught on faster. "You cultivate yourself like a weapon?"</p>

  <p>Winchell suddenly recalled Luo Zheng's special ability. After all, his son was saved by Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng's body was really different from an ordinary warrior's, but it was very strange indeed to use the Shade Stones in his cultivation.</p>

  <p>"I know of an Other Shore Treasure made of the Shade Stone," said the old man who was responsible for distributing flags in the Dragon city. "It's in the Bloom Divine Province."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up. He cupped his hands with a bow. "Master, please tell me more."</p>

  <p>"That Shade Stone has been passed down for generations in a nonhuman race. It was forged into a hammer, but their forging process was poor. While a Shade Stone can definitely be forged into a premium Other Shore Treasure, this hammer is only a primary Other Shore Treasure. I can help you with this request!" the old man said with certainty.</p>

  <p>"Master, thank you very much!" Luo Zheng thanked him sincerely. "I had been in the Dragon City for a while, and we have met so many times, yet I still don't know your name..."</p>

  <p>When he was in the Dragon City, Luo Zheng had already noticed that the old man's cultivation base was extraordinary. He had asked Monica and the others about him, but they had no idea who he was.</p>

  <p>If this person was able to chat and joke around with the likes of Qiu Yinhe, he couldn't be a nobody.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe smiled and said, "It's not appropriate to tell you his name, but you can call him Master Hai."</p>

  <p>After expressing his thanks again, Luo Zheng left contentedly.</p>

  <p>Although Goran said Luo Zheng could make a request to each of them, Luo Zheng knew he had to watch out for his limitations.</p>

  <p>If Master Hai could really get his hands on the hammer, then his body would be able to fuse with the third Shade Stone. The strength of his body might be able to reach a whole new level!</p>
