<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1247 Going Back To The Central Region </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the tremor stopped, many of the creatures were still in a daze, doubt etched on their faces.</p>

  <p>"It stopped just like that? What is going on? Weren't the Celestial Position warriors taking the Tower of Sin away?"</p>

  <p>"Is this happening because they don't have the strength to take it away?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe..."</p>

  <p>After quite a few minutes of speculation, they finally understood that the Tower of Sin hadn't been taken away, and that the tower was now in its complete form.</p>

  <p>But in this process, they had learned an important piece of information? the Tower of Sin could exist on the Sea God Continent for only three hundred years. The Celestial Position members would take it away after the period was up.</p>

  <p>Creatures on the Sea God Continent were both relieved and worried at the news. The fact that the Celestial Position race was willing to give them a buffer was already a great favor.</p>

  <p>It was said that this buffer period had been granted because Luo Luo Zheng had agreed to certain conditions of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>What was more, the Celestial Position warriors had set up two transmission arrays in the Tower of Sin. One was connected to the Purple Heart Sacred Place, and the other to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>This way the Demon Night and human race could have greater control over the Tower of Sin. After all, once the war lords of the other races became war sages, they would have to use one of these transmission arrays to go between the tower and the outside world if they wanted to continue cultivating in the tower.</p>

  <p>Once the Eight-diagram Wheel had flown back to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, Luo Luo Zheng pulled his soul out of his puppet. He smiled as he looked at it, an almost exact replica of himself. He said to Hank, "Can I keep this puppet?"</p>

  <p>"No problem," Hank said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Hank might not be the strongest among the seven people of the Celestial Position race, but he knew a lot of things. He spoke rarely, but his straightforward character had impressed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng put the puppet, an incredible likeness of a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior, into his space ring.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position warriors had had only one purpose in coming to the Sea God Continent: to take away the Tower of Crystal. But once it was confirmed that Luo Luo Zheng had actually obtained the golden title of Celestial Position, he had helped the Sea God Continent warriors ask a great favor of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>That was not to say that Luo Luo Zheng was against joining the Celestial Position race. Although Brianna had called this race a crazy one, they were still a neutral force compared to the other forces in the universe.</p>

  <p>Plus, he had to wait until after he ascended to the Upper World to become a member of the Celestial Position race. And since he had just entered the Life and Death Realm, nobody knew when he would ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>They'd been on the Sea God Continent for more than a month. Compared to when they'd arrived, the Celestial Position warriors were more patient now and did not have much to worry about. Once Luo Luo Zheng had managed to persuade them, the seven of them had a rare tour of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng had chosen to stay for a month on this continent because of Amber.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Amber had wanted to squeeze out the life energy from the holy tree and pour it into Xun's soul. The holy tree had already been severely injured, which was why Luo Luo Zheng refused.</p>

  <p>But in the next few days, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place displayed great vitality, changing with every passing day. The originally messy sacred place transformed such that all the plants began to grow crazily.</p>

  <p>The surface of the holy tree had also recovered quite a bit. Following Amber's repeated requests, Luo Luo Zheng finally agreed to stay in the sacred place.</p>

  <p>A month later, when the holy tree had replenished a portion of its life energy, Luo Luo Zheng finally handed the Soul Nurturing Wood to Amber.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was a lot more careful this time. He had broken the statue of Queen of Punishment, but the Demon Night members had erected another statue in the blink of an eye. He was afraid that that evil woman would control the Demon Night members to attack Xun again.</p>

  <p>And now, only Amber and Luo Luo Zheng remained at the top of the holy tree. The tree began to shake slightly, a vigorous life energy starting to gather along its branches.</p>

  <p>The life energy extracted from the holy tree this time was far less than what it was the last time. But once the life energy was poured into the Soul Nurturing Wood, Luo Zheng's perception also entered the wood to examine Xun's situation. He could feel that she was much better now.</p>

  <p>She hadn't yet woken up and was still in a deep sleep, but she would eventually wake up.</p>

  <p>But it wouldn't be easy if he wanted to control the sword spirit within his body to fight like he had in the past.</p>

  <p>After dealing with this, Luo Luo Zheng and the Celestial Position warriors would return to the Central Region. But this time, Max and the rest did not use the Eight-diagram Wheel. They merely stood on a branch of the holy tree and asked Luo Luo Zheng to join them.</p>

  <p>"Aren't we going to use the Eight-diagram Wheel to go back?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Delroy smiled and said, "There's no need. We have left a transportation imprint in the Central Region, so we don't need to travel across the sea."</p>

  <p>It was not until then that Luo Luo Zheng remembered that they had left a blood-red cross mark in the Heavenly Stellar Palace. They had also left a similar mark in front of the cemetery on the Divine Emperor Island. Such a mark ensured that they could easy travel to the place it was left in. 'Wow! This is really convenient!' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself and went to stand beside them.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a blood-red flag appeared in Hank's hand, pulsing with a strong power of space. He waved the flag gently, and a blood-red belt of light began to float around them. Soon enough, a powerful gravitational force began pulling at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't resist this power," said Dorothea from beside him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, and the force pulled him into a transportation channel.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how the Celestial Position warriors had managed to travel to a place so far away in such a short time.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng usually used a large-scale transmission array and even with that, it would take him a long time to reach his destination. When Luo Luo Zheng had traveled from Immortal Mist's celestial tomb to the Sea God Continent, he had been severely injured during the transportation. This had happened upon his return from the Sea God Continent as well.</p>

  <p>But it took them only about thirty seconds to return to the Central Region through this transportation channel, one that seemed amazingly stable.</p>

  <p>A light began to flash from the blood-red cross mark before the Heavenly Stellar Palace in Oracle City. Luo Luo Zheng and the seven members of Celestial Position race appeared in this light.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position warriors did not stay in the Central Region for long. Max told Luo Luo Zheng that they would report to the upper echelons of their race about Luo Luo Zheng, and others would take over. After that, they would continue to deal with the Evil Dragon. Minutes later, they activated the transmission imprint on the Divine Emperor Island and headed towards the continent.</p>

  <p>As he watched the Celestial Position warriors disappear, Luo Luo Zheng thought, 'I think the Celestial Position race has a dispute with Master Derek and Marine.' But he merely shrugged since it had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt a sense of relaxation spread through his entire body.</p>

  <p>From the moment he had begun cultivating, time had been like a giant rock pressing against him, constantly pushing him forward. There were still things that he had to do, like helping Xun recover her status and finding his sister.</p>

  <p>But these were still far beyond his reach, and he couldn't accomplish them in a short period of time. For example, the young man who had taken Yan away was unimaginably stronger than Luo Luo Zheng. Even now, with his current strength, Luo Luo Zheng had no doubt that that young man could kill him a thousand times over with just a single glance. Even this great world might not be able to withstand his attack.</p>

  <p>So this was a rare moment of relaxation for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He took a look around the Heavenly Stellar Palace. The hall was already empty. Ning Yudie should have returned to the Cloud Hall once she had recovered. 'Would Mu Ning have followed Ning Yudie back to the Cloud Hall?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Just as he thought this, he saw a hefty guy flying over. It was Dillon, one of the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance. The moment he saw Luo Luo Zheng, Dillon broke out in a sweat as he shouted, "Luo Luo Zheng, you're finally back! Something terrible has happened! They're fighting!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was curious. "They're fighting? Who?"</p>
