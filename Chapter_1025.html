  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not show any mercy or too much killing intent when he faced Eddie.</p>

  <p>In order to fight him, Luo Luo Zheng had already adjusted his state of mind to be at its best. He looked calm and expressionless? neither happy nor sad.</p>

  <p>He suddenly threw a punch at his enemy, and the power of the forceful energy and the dragon scales erupted instantly.</p>

  <p>Compared to Eddie's Supreme Emperor Fist, Luo Zheng's punch did not appear to be so powerful, but it was much more deadly and brutal!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng's fist was about to hit Eddie, a black mist emitted from Eddie's body and enveloped him.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's fist struck Eddie, it didn't feel like he was hitting a human body. It was as if the punch had landed on a thick cotton pad. The unstoppable fist was like a stone that had fallen into the sea and disappeared without a trace!</p>

  <p>'What's going on?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow furrowed.</p>

  <p>The black mist that emerged from Eddie's body was very strange. Last time in the Ethereal City, the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit had utilized the Dragon-trapping Rope, and launched their strongest attack, but it had not caused any damage to Eddie due to this same mist!</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng understood why the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit had been so shocked back then.</p>

  <p>But he still remained expressionless. With Eddie, he knew that anything could happen! What he needed to do was to stabilize his state of mind and showcase his might.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the black mist, Eddie did not seem to be harmed in any way, but Luo Luo Zheng did not stop there. A second round of attacks followed!</p>

  <p>"I'll take you down!"</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grabbed Eddie who was in the black mist and released the forceful energy in his body once again, trying to push Eddie down!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Just like that, Luo Luo Zheng pushed Eddie all the way down into the big crater. He didn't stop here; he pushed him further into the big crater and kept running.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of warriors on both sides witnessed the scene. Luo Luo Zheng continued to force Eddie to the ground, causing dust to billow all the way up. The two of them were completely engulfed in the smoke.</p>

  <p>One lap, two laps, three laps?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still holding Eddie down and running, plowing deep ditches that formed circles in the crater!</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Luo Zheng stopped. His eyes now had a faint killing intent. He threw his fist at Eddie again and a wave of intense explosions was heard!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>It was as if many firecrackers were going off at the same time the way they did during New Year celebrations. In the corner of the crater, smoke and dust were blooming like a mushroom. Nobody was able to see the battle clearly.</p>

  <p>On the city wall, the warriors of the World Commercial Alliance and the people from the Cloud Hall felt their blood boiling as they watched this scene!</p>

  <p>The strength of the Heavenly Evil Sect was unimaginable. It wasn't because of the hundreds of thousands of independent warriors they had, nor was it because of Simon. Eddie alone was responsible for its reputation. He was the strongest person in the Central Region and it was a well-deserved title.</p>

  <p>In the past few decades, no one had been able to shake Eddie's position or test his true strength.</p>

  <p>He was like a nightmare floating above all the sects in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>His power alone was more intimidating than that of the Cloud Hall or the Ethereal Spirit Sect. He was on par with the World Commercial Alliance!</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why the Small Circulation Killing Array set up by Luo Luo Zheng at the Cloud Hall had caused a sensation in the entire Central Region!</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall possessed a terrifying array that could block someone as powerful as Eddie, so no one in the Central Region could shake the Cloud Hall. The sect-protecting array had already placed the Cloud Hall in an invincible position.</p>

  <p>However, it was just a shield. It was common knowledge that the Cloud Hall's overall strength was inferior to that of the Ethereal Spirit Sect or the World Commercial Alliance. Therefore, back then, the Ethereal Spirit Sect was still the number one sect in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Luo Zheng had once again completely overturned the very concept that their mind had been founded on. A Cloud Hall disciple was actually forcing Eddie on the ground. Wasn't this a bit too much?</p>

  <p>"Eddie doesn't seem to have the power to fight back at all! I'm afraid that Luo Zheng's true strength has already surpassed that of the leader of the Cloud Hall and the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance!"</p>

  <p>"He was a warrior in the Illuminating Soul Realm two years ago. The speed at which he has risen... is so incredible!"</p>

  <p>"This is a big blow for us! But it feels great to see him beating up Eddie like that!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's impending victory greatly boosted the morale of the martial artists of the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall! On the other hand, the morale of the hundreds of thousands of disciples in the Heavenly Evil Sect started to plummet.</p>

  <p>"Can the Lord make it through? The strongest warrior in the Central Region actually got beaten up by a young man who is only twenty years old. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't even believe it!"</p>

  <p>"He is just twenty? You have underestimated Luo Luo Zheng. When he was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm, he was able to crush ordinary divine-level talents at the Internal Elixir Realm. This kind of person is probably beyond ordinary concepts of talent. The Central Region is not the place for such a figure!"</p>

  <p>"What if the Lord really loses, or gets killed by that kid?"</p>

  <p>"Humph, that will not happen! If the Lord doesn't have the strength to take down this child, our Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom will be a joke. Don't worry, the Lord will not lose!"</p>

  <p>Many martial artists of the Heavenly Evil Sect were anxious. The fact that their leader, Eddie was being beaten up ruthlessly was hard for them to digest. After all, most of them had only joined the sect because of Eddie's reputation. They didn't expect him to be thrashed so badly by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attacks were continuous and intense, and he had poured all of his power into pummeling Eddie's body endlessly. But every punch seemed to have little effect? it was like hitting a cotton pad. Eddie's body seemed to have entered a strange state under the cover of the black mist. All the blows that struck his body were erased without a trace!</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Luo Zheng was gasping for breath and decided to stop. He stared coldly at the black mist in front of him.</p>

  <p>He had used almost all of his strength in this round of attack. He might have been able to destroy more than ten enormous mountains using this much strength.</p>

  <p>But not Eddie. He was still lying motionless on the ground, shrouded in black mist.</p>

  <p>"Hahahaha!"</p>

  <p>Not long after, Eddie's muffled laughter rang out from the black mist. It became louder and louder!</p>

  <p>Hearing the booming laughter, Yudie's face turned solemn. She shook her head and said, "Eddie has not been hurt."</p>

  <p>"He managed to remain unharmed even with such an lethal attack! Wow!</p>

  <p>His strength is unfathomable!" Saint Morphens frowned as he watched the movement below the city walls.</p>

  <p>As for the Ancient Tycoon and the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance, they knew full well that Luo Luo Zheng would not be able to kill Eddie, but at this moment, they all remained grim. Eddie's strength was beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Simon was expressionless. He was feeling conflicted.</p>

  <p>Eddie being too strong or too weak was not a good thing for him.</p>

  <p>As for the many independent warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect, they now looked cheerful and hopeful. They knew that their Lord couldn't possibly be so weak!</p>

  <p>The black mist surrounding Eddie gradually dissipated, and his tall, robust figure slowly revealed itself. His entire body was now covered in a layer of black scales, and a thin, long horn had sprouted on his head!</p>

  <p>"You have truly surprised me. Within two years, you have grown to be able to threaten my existence. I never expected such a talent to be present in the Central Region!" As he spoke, he slowly floated up into the air. With a vicious light glinting in his eyes, he stated, "However, your strength is not enough to defeat me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes were as calm as water. He asked, "Not enough? Do you think I am weaker than you?"</p>

  <p>"Your strength is far from enough!" Eddie roared, all the bones in his body began crackling. It was as though his bones had rearranged themselves, and his entire body underwent an astonishing change. The lower half of his legs bulged forward, as though they were an animal's legs. The muscles on his body also started to swell. His entire body had doubled in size!</p>

  <p>Eddie did not look human anymore. His figure was as large as that of an ogre on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was surprised to see this change in Eddie's body. 'He seems to have some kind of special bloodline. What kind of race does he belong to? Is he an ogre? Or a dragon? Or another race...' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>A faint voice rang out in his mind. It was the cyan dragon who answered,</p>

  <p>"You guessed right, Eddie belongs to another race. But he is not a descendant of any of the over one hundred races in the Upper World. He is a fiend from the netherworld."</p>

  <p>"A fiend!" Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat but he calmly stared at Eddie, who was standing not too far from him.</p>
