  <p>
</p>

  <p>After revealing such confidential information, Luo Nian started becoming quite nervous.</p>

  <p>Most of the humans in the Source World and the divine land knew very little about the truth of the chaos, and they were blindly optimistic about the future.</p>

  <p>Their naive optimism sprang from their ignorance. Once the disaster finally befell them, they would not even have a chance to react before they were wiped out from the world.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Nian had acquired vast amounts of information from his father, so he was more aware of the impending crisis than most people.</p>

  <p>He was well aware that the chaos was not as stable as most people falsely believed. On the contrary, it was more like a candle flickering in a storm, and it could be snuffed out at any time.</p>

  <p>He couldn't anticipate what the consequences would be now that he had revealed so much information to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>However, since the old man was someone Tianming could trust, he hoped he was someone worthy of his trust as well.</p>

  <p>But Luo Nian would never have known the old man was Ziya's uncle.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord became excited for a while before he regained his composure and asked, "As far as I know, the space and time of the main world are vastly different from those of the chaos. Even if Ziya and you managed to leave the chaos, it would be difficult for you to move even a single step. Have you ever experienced the Red Jade Rite?"</p>

  <p>Within the entire human race, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was the only one who knew so much about the main world, and that was only due to his mysterious and unique past journeys.</p>

  <p>He knew that there was a special and secret method in the Four Spirits Sect that could transform creatures from the secondary worlds into creatures of the main world.</p>

  <p>However, this secret method hinged on the availability of some extremely rare materials from the main world. Moreover, those qualified to undergo the Red Jade Rite were usually the most important disciples of the Four Spirits Sect, and this was only performed in very rare cases.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the current Four Spirits Sect might no longer have the ability to perform such a rite.</p>

  <p>'What is the Red Jade Rite?' Luo Nian mused. He had never heard of such a thing. After pondering, he then replied, "No, sir. Master Ziya can't see anything in the main world, but I can. I've brought him all the way here..."</p>

  <p>"What?! You have sight in the main world? Is this true?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord demanded in shock.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Nian simply stated.</p>

  <p>Although the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had known it was impossible for Luo Nian to climb up the pillar if he couldn't see within the main world, he was still awed when he received the confirmation.</p>

  <p>This should have been virtually impossible...</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord questioned.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian Luo," Luo Nian answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his surname, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord reflexively thought of Luo Zheng. He blurted out the resulting conjecture, "Is  Luo Zheng your father?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Nian replied. "How do you know my father?"</p>

  <p>Since Tianming had appeared in this tower, it confirmed that this old man must have connections to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Nian was not surprised that this old man knew his father.</p>

  <p>Still, he wanted to know how he knew his father.</p>

  <p>After careful consideration, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord started narrating his stories.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Weapon Refining Method your father practiced at the start of his cultivation was passed down from me..."</p>

  <p>The Grand Weapon Refining Method had been the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's prized possession for many years. He had followed the advice of his predecessor during the mysterious journey and had been very cautious about selecting a suitable user.</p>

  <p>After the 77th chaos, humans had vanished from the Source World for many chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>As time trickled by, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been at a loss on how to deal with the Grand Weapon Refining Method.</p>

  <p>Should he relinquish it to another ruling civilization?</p>

  <p>But that wouldn't do...</p>

  <p>Most ruling civilizations had refused to oppose the powerful Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Once a chaotic era ended, a small number of elites of the ruling civilizations retreated into the Other Shore, where they would usually join the Element Spirit Civilization for survival.</p>

  <p>Still, only a small number of ruling civilizations had ever chosen to fight against the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had secretly observed these civilizations, including the Green Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>For example, the Wing King had been high up on his list.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, at that time, the Green Jade Civilization had cultivated a great enmity with not only the Element Spirit Civilization but also the Nihility race. In addition, there was a significant difference between the Green Jade Civilization and the human race.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had crossed him off the list in the end.</p>

  <p>After another three hundred chaotic eras, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord still hid away in the Jade Pure Realm, silently observing the world.</p>

  <p>When the current chaotic era came, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord finally found a better opportunity.</p>

  <p>The seeds human race had sowed finally sprouted in the Source World!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Divine Farmer, Xuanyuan, Zhurong, Emperor Di Jun, Gonggong, Chiyou... It was a great era of talents.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord kept on observing in secret as he searched for the most suitable candidate.</p>

  <p>After the appearance of the Primitive Land, the competition within it grew fierce.</p>

  <p>Some of the young talents perished in the competition, such as Gonggong and Zhurong.</p>

  <p>Many others were powerful, but they chose to join the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been waiting for so many chaotic eras, so he was particularly patient in this era.</p>

  <p>This was a matter of great importance, and he needed to ensure everything was suitable.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had considered Fuxi as the ideal candidate.</p>

  <p>Being powerful, Fuxi had the assistance of the Snake Goddess, and the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds inside the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>However, with the support of the Element Spirit Civilization, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer continued to amass strength. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord became hesitant.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Nine Li race was annihilated. Chiyou exiled the divine land from the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord then pinned his hope on the divine land.</p>

  <p>He decided to choose this new land as the hiding place of the precious Grand Weapon Refining Method, where it was then discovered by Gu Bei.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian silently listened as he sat on the pillar.</p>

  <p>It was exhausting for him to communicate through the red light, therefore, he remained silent while he could.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know Father had been involved in so many great secrets..."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>After listening to the entire story, Luo Nian suddenly asked, "Is it because of the Grand Weapon Refining Method that I am able to move freely in the Abstruse Energy World?"</p>

  <p>"That is the only possible conclusion we can draw for now," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord agreed with a chuckle. "Do you have any siblings?</p>

  <p>Do they possess the same abilities as you do?"</p>

  <p>"I was an only child when I left home..." Luo Nian replied. He was unaware that Xi Youqin had given birth to his sister after his departure.</p>

  <p>"Then set this aside for the time being," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said. "Which stair have you reached on the pillar now?" he changed the topic.</p>

  <p>"I almost reach the top." Luo Nian's eyes shone with joy. "Is there something I can do to help you? I can modify the ability of the Other Shore Tokens," he offered.</p>

  <p>"What?! Can you modify their abilities directly?!" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord couldn't help but exclaim in astonishment.</p>

  <p>The young cyan-robed man's ears immediately perked up with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes! If you don't believe that, let me change this sword for you now!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Nian spoke, he extended his hand towards the end of the red light, where a small black stone was.</p>

  <p>"Please don't!" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord hastily interceded. "This Lone Sword is a powerful weapon. Even though many have carried it, none of them could unleash its power. We've been waiting for someone who can unravel the mysteries within it."</p>

  <p>The more mysterious things were, the more attractive they became.</p>

  <p>Even the omniscient Grand Supreme Elderly Lord clung to the same belief. He hoped that someone could discover the truth about this mysterious sword.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Luo Nian let out a chuckle as he replied, "I know why nobody could unleash the power of this sword! It's because a part of this page has been damaged..."</p>

  <p>As Luo Nian was about to remove the small black stone, he discovered a deep crack on the step.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what had initially caused this crack, but he believed this was why the sword couldn't unleash its power.</p>

  <p>After Luo Nian shared this information, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and the cyan-robed young man exchanged dismayed glances.</p>

  <p>It now appeared that this mysterious sword that they always cherished was actually a damaged Other Shore Token.</p>
