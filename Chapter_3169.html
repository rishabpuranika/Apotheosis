<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ran his eyes like daggers scouting the place while standing on the smooth giant stone. There were a total of ten giant stones, and on each, there were twenty people perched atop.</p>

  <p>Six stones were occupied by disciples from Origin Mountain, Vastness Mountain, and the other four mountains respectively.</p>

  <p>Each of three sword sects of the Taiyi Mountain possessed a stone, and the disciples led by Feng Ge took up the tenth stone.</p>

  <p>It was the first time for Luo Zheng and Imran to participate in the Seven Mountains Meeting amongst the twenty people from the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>As they took their time to adjust to the situation, Konnor turned towards both of them and said, "Have you two been proficient in employing the Other Shore Power?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say I'm decent with it," Imran answered in all seriousness.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to worry, I have too," Luo Zheng said as he nodded in response.</p>

  <p>Of course, a person who was able to be recognized as an elite disciple by the Heart Flow Sect was by no means ordinary.</p>

  <p>"This stone we're standing on is very heavy. We have to work together to use a hundred Jun of force to lift it up later. At that time, it will depend on everyone's efforts." Konnor briefed them on what they had to do.</p>

  <p>"Wait, what? We have to lift it up?" Imran blinked aggressively and stared at Konnor in shock.</p>

  <p>They had to use a hundred Jun of force to lift the stone up!</p>

  <p>Going under it to raise it up together would be no problem, but how could they lift it while standing on top of it, knowing the surface was smooth?</p>

  <p>"Okay, here's the plan. All of us need to work together to fix ourselves on the stone and then ascend in the air with all our might." Konnor paused for a moment to process it in his thoughts, and then he added, "It would be better if you have cultivated the Might Divine Dao. In that case, you can easily control your strength."</p>

  <p>"The Might Divine Dao..." Luo Zheng blinked with curious eyes while listening to the briefing. "Why do we have to lift this stone up?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's question, Konnor pointed to the small metal mountain in the distance and said, "The rule is actually very simple. Do you see the top of that mountain?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Imran glanced in the direction of Konnor's hand in unison. There were three small plates on the top of the metal mountain. Each of them differed in heights.</p>

  <p>"We have to put this stone on the top place to win first plate. If we place it on the second plate, we'll end up in second place, and the same goes for the third one." Explaining the rules made Konnor remember the events of the last time they competed. He chuckled and said, "Three years ago, Milo just entered the Other Shore Realm. His strength was quite weak, but he managed to turn the tables on his own. He took the stone and put it on the first plate!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked his eyes and asked, "Then let's pull this stone and compete with them to see which stone reaches the top of the mountain first. Will that help us win the first place?"</p>

  <p>"No, you've got it all wrong." Konnor shook his head and glanced at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The mountain is divided into three layers. First, we'll have to take this stone and rush to the first layer to get a weight rune. Then the weight of the stone will double; this is where it gets hard. After we climb to the second layer and get the second weight rune, we can rush to the top of the mountain."</p>

  <p>"Okay, I get it now." Luo Zheng gave him an acknowledging nod.</p>

  <p>This was like a dragon boat race, in which people of the same team worked together to reach all three destinations. The first group that reached the final destination would be granted as the victor.</p>

  <p>However, the road to win wasn't easy. Throughout their conquest to victory, the disciples from other mountains would attack them to hinder their progress.</p>

  <p id="top_21">"This seems to be a contest of pure strength. But Konnor, you said that the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent would determine the results of the game.</p>

  <p>Why would you say that?" Luo Zheng furrowed his brows in confusion.</p>

  <p>After all, the reason why Konnor had invited Luo Zheng to participate in the Seven Mountains Meeting was that he had heard that Luo Zheng was capable of Instant Enlightenment. But after learning the rules of the game, Luo Zheng found this game had nothing to do with the Instant Enlightenment or the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>At his concerns, Konnor smiled warmly and responded, "Luo Zheng, have you heard of the Imperial Sword Seal?"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe's Imperial Sword Seal was quite famous, as it proved useful on many different occasions.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, Qiu Yinhe was not the strongest among the Oneness Governors. But the ability of his Other Shore Token alone was capable of raising the entire power of the Taiyi Heaven Palace to a higher level!</p>

  <p>For instance, the Grand River Fortress in the Mountain Viewing Province was deemed impregnable. Not only did it depend on the powerful sword array, but also on the several Lofty Swords placed by Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>When an Imperial Sword Seal was applied on a sword, two conditions determined the overall strength and its effects: the grade of the sword itself and the Truth of Divine Dao released by the sword's owner.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the sword's owner could cause severe damage despite not being strong.</p>

  <p>The Truth Competition of the Sword Light Palace actually had a different use of the Imperial Sword Seal. Unfortunately, the Sword Light Palace was unqualified to wield an Imperial Sword Seal. Thus, the palace had to make do with the Lofty Sword instead.</p>

  <p>"Of course I have," Luo Zheng said as he grinned in response.</p>

  <p>After all, he possessed an Imperial Sword Seal that was personally crafted by Qiu Yinhe himself.</p>

  <p>"There is something similar to the Imperial Sword Seal on the stone. If you don't want this stone to become a burden, you will need to use it properly.</p>

  <p>You'll understand it soon enough," Konnor said as he patted Luo Zheng on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Tacy and the people from the Land of Sword Grief flew in the sky to assume their positions. They made their way to the top of the mountain. Suddenly, Tacy's voice echoed in the vast cave, and resonated in everyone's ears. "Although it's not the first time you all are participating in this game, I still need to make some rules clear. The first one is that the stones under your feet are not allowed to touch the ground once you've lifted them up. The second is that you can only use the stones under your feet to dash against the others'. You are not allowed to attack one another by using your theurgies. If anyone of you breaks any of the rules, you will be eliminated immediately."</p>

  <p>After briefing everyone about the rules, she waved her hand in the air gently.</p>

  <p>At this gesture, tiny threads began to spring out from her fingertips and spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>On the surface of the small metal mountain in the cave, many intricate patterns further divided the mountain into three layers. In the first and second layers, there were three floating arrays respectively.</p>

  <p>At the same time, circular patterns appeared on the surfaces of the stones under the disciples' feet. Three runes appeared on each of the ten stones.</p>

  <p>Konnor went ahead and positioned himself on one of the runes. Then he turned to face his companions and said, "Everyone, stay alert! The game has started. Let's work together and win this!"</p>

  <p>The rune he was standing on functioned as the navigator of the giant stone.</p>

  <p>At his command, Luo Zheng, Imran, and the other people of the Heart Flow Sect all drew out the Other Shore Power and firmly rooted themselves onto the giant stone.</p>

  <p>It proved difficult to lift it up at first even with the combined strength of all the disciples.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The giant stone slowly lifted itself up in the air responding to the combined efforts of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Then, Konnor focused and released the truth aura from his body. The truth aura spread around the stone under his feet and formed a connection with it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the stone turned around and was about to rush towards the metal mountain in the middle of the cave.</p>

  <p>Their primary goal was to get the weight rune in the floating array in the first layer. Konnor had planned this all in his head to stay one step ahead of the others.</p>

  <p>However, just as he started to move the stone, he heard a burst of loud laughter coming from the left. One of the voices referred to them in a provoking tone, "Konnor, do you honestly think you could just rush over like that? Don't you think you're being a bit naive?"</p>

  <p>The blunt voice belonged to Hare Sang of the Killing Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, as soon as the stone of the Killing Sword Sect had obtained the first weight rune, Milo's stone had dashed against theirs, and Hare Sang had fallen to the ground with his men. He had been biding his time since then for this opportunity to avenge himself!</p>

  <p>As soon as the game began, Hare Sang, who was leading the members of Killing Sword Sect, drove their stone to rush towards Konnor. They wanted to eliminate the Heart Flow Sect now to get even with them.</p>
