<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The shaking of the earth lasted for a while before it finally stopped. Then, everyone saw that a body was thrown out of the deep pit. It was none other than Zheng.</p>

  <p>The blue transparent crystal on the surface of Zheng's body showed countless cracks that came in various sizes and extended inward. Even his dark blue bones also had cracks. As he received the full impacts of Hawley's heavy punches, his body wasn't able to withstand them anymore.</p>

  <p>The warriors of various races all fell silent as they witnessed the crushing impact of the extent of Hawley's strength.</p>

  <p>Among the creatures that were spectating, there were actually some spies sent by the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization. Earlier, they were planning to report that the Flaming Maple Forest might change its ruler. However, the sudden turn of events made the situation more complicated.</p>

  <p>Although it was a unanimous idea that Hawley would be unbeatable, seeing his true strength with their own eyes still rendered them speechless.</p>

  <p>It went beyond their wildest expectations.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Finally." After walking out of the deep pit, Hawley approached Wheeler while gesturing something.</p>

  <p>Wheeler quickly understood what he meant, so he immediately took out a basin of Soul Interdicting Water from the Divine River and splashed it on Zheng's crumbling body. This way, even if Zheng regained his consciousness, he would not be able to escape.</p>

  <p>After Wheeler was done with his job, Hawley walked over and stared down at Zheng's body, which was covered with countless cracks. "No one can challenge my physical strength. You may be an extraordinary warrior in the Three Purities Stage, but you're still nothing in front of me!"</p>

  <p>Then, he raised his foot and stepped on Zheng's left leg. He continued to exert his force that instantly increased and enlarged the cracks on Zheng's leg.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crash!</p>

  <p>Zheng's leg exploded, turning into thousands of pieces that scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others couldn't help but twitch their eyes and bite their lips.</p>

  <p>After two rounds of strengthening, Zheng's body still failed to withstand and endure Hawley's attacks.</p>

  <p>If he died here today, all of his efforts in his journey on the Other Shore would go to waste.</p>

  <p>"This is a mistake after all! Zheng's life is much more important than mine and the Oneness Sky Palace!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi regretted the fact that Zheng needed to suffer just to save his life. He was deeply frustrated and couldn't help but blame himself.</p>

  <p>Although Yasamin didn't say anything, it was evident in her face that she had the same thoughts.</p>

  <p>For them, Zheng seemed to be their last hope, and the only person that could possibly complete the Finale Way. Now that he fell because of going out of his way to save them, they felt that it was not worth it.</p>

  <p>With all the thoughts and emotions that were surging, the Snake Goddess didn't say anything and just looked at Zheng with a serious expression.</p>

  <p>She still refused to believe that it was the end for Zheng. He showed them several miracles before, and she knew more than anyone that Zheng was the last person to accept such kind of fate.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Hawley stomped on Zheng's right leg and immediately shattered it into countless pieces of blue crystals.</p>

  <p>He wasn't finished yet. He raised his foot again, and this time, aimed for Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>However, when Hawley's foot was about to hit Zheng's abdomen, Zheng finally opened his eyes and stared at Hawley with his scarlet eyes.</p>

  <p>When Hawley's eyes locked with Zheng's, he instantly felt a shiver crept beneath his skin. He started trembling as if a ghost came back to life to haunt him. With that, he instinctively wanted to kill Zheng as soon as possible, so he immediately gathered his strength on his foot, and stomped as hard as he could.</p>

  <p>However, just before he hit Zheng's body, a space fluctuation was suddenly released from it. Zheng instantly disappeared and Hawley's foot hit nothing but the ground.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Since the space fluctuation spread, the Flaming Maple Forest quickly perceived it. Countless maple leaves started circling and lighting up. They flocked like numerous vicious butterflies searching for their prey.</p>

  <p>"Humph. What a foolish move. You just started the final thirty seconds of your life," Hawley said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>The members of the Misty River race, the warriors from various races, and even the Eternal Realm masters sighed as they looked at the maple leaves.</p>

  <p>No matter how far they were, how fast they ran, or how hard they tried to hide, these maple leaves would always arrive in thirty seconds and punish the one who violated the rules. Right now, Zheng's only chance to escape was to leave the Other Shore. However, Hawley also cut off this means by asking Wheeler to pour the Soul Interdicting Water of the Divine River on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Therefore, right now, in the eyes of the crowd, Zheng only had thirty seconds left to spare before his tragic death. Within this time, he could only do nothing but struggle desperately until his time was up.</p>

  <p>For the members of the Misty River race, they liked to appreciate this given time. They enjoyed seeing the warriors from other races and even the Eternal Realm warriors struggle within those thirty seconds, knowing that the end results would still be the same.</p>

  <p>There were times that the cruel members of the Misty River race forced the creatures of other races and the Eternal Realm warriors to activate their energy in order to enjoy their struggles in the last thirty seconds of their lives.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>As Zheng disappeared, he immediately built a space channel. The maple leaves quickly separated from the Flaming Maple Trees and flew into the sky.</p>

  <p>"What is that brat doing? Is he deliberately attracting many maple leaves?"</p>

  <p>"That number of maple leaves are enough to kill him ten times!"</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't matter. In the end, only his death will be certain."</p>

  <p>The maple leaves of the Flaming Maple Forest actually had several magical properties. For one, they would surely catch up with their targets within thirty seconds. Another would be that the damages caused by the explosions of the maple leaves were unstoppable.</p>

  <p>Even if one used a powerful enchanted barrier or a space channel, it would still be unable to block the damage that was brought by the maple leaves' explosions.</p>

  <p>As Zheng emerged from the space channel, they saw a green light enveloping the surface of his body and his broken legs quickly recovering. He looked back at the maples leaves that were hunting him and entered the space channel again.</p>

  <p>He drew an invisible path in the entire Flaming Maple Forest, attracting countless maple leaves in the process.</p>

  <p>"Wow, this guy runs so fast. He has gone a lap around the forest in such a short time."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, but it doesn't matter anymore. He only gets eighteen seconds left."</p>

  <p>"Fifteen seconds more?"</p>

  <p>"Twelve seconds left! Is he not tired yet?"</p>

  <p>"Let him be. After all, that's all he can do now."</p>

  <p>"Six seconds left!"</p>

  <p>"Three seconds before the explosion." "Here it comes..."</p>

  <p>Everyone counted precisely, so they knew that they were on track. With that number of maple leaves chasing Zheng, no matter where he escaped, the loud sound of the explosion would quickly transmit and reverberate.</p>

  <p>"Boom!" Larkin shouted as he cheered for the explosion that everyone was waiting for.</p>

  <p>However, thirty seconds had already elapsed, but not even a little explosion was heard.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, what they saw was that Zheng emerged in the air. This time, he was flying in the sky and not in the space channel, so they clearly saw more maple leaves that were chasing after him.</p>

  <p>A large number of maple leaves had accumulated behind him. However, the leaves weren't cutting the gap. They did not stop chasing Zheng, but they also couldn't get close to him.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes widened as they saw this scene. Hawley was the most shocked. He clenched his fists and yelled, "How the hell is that possible?!"</p>

  <p>Due to his overwhelming anger, a slight energy fluctuation was released from his shoulder. Although the fluctuation was very minimal, it didn't escape from the sense of a maple leaf on a nearby tree. Immediately, it suddenly lit up and rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>Hawley came to his senses and quickly dodged the maple leaf. He struggled so hard just to get away from it.</p>

  <p>However, exactly after thirty seconds, the maple leaf successfully reached Hawley and exploded on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even though Hawley's body had an astonishing defense, the explosion of a single maple leaf still created a crack on the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>"These maple leaves work just fine!" Hawley gritted his teeth in confusion.</p>

  <p>"What the heck did that human do?!"</p>

  <p>Zheng continued circling around the forest, attracting more and more maple leaves in the process. So much time had now elapsed, but the maple leaves still weren't even close to catching up with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What the hell! Did he really do something with the maple leaves?"</p>

  <p>"This is impossible. This has never happened since ancient times! The power of the maple leaves is absolute!"</p>

  <p>The members of various races and the Eternal Realm warriors were all flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>"What sort of miracle did he do this time?"</p>
