  <p>
</p>

  <p>As long as Luo Nian cultivated in Luo Zheng's inner world, he would be safe, since everything was under Luo Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>But, once he stepped out, there was no telling what dangers he might encounter. Naturally, Yudie began to worry.</p>

  <p>When she started to protest against this decision, Luo Nian retorted, "I didn't ask you, Mom. I'm asking my father!"</p>

  <p>Since he was still a child, Yudie pampered him a lot but, she was also strict with him when it came to serious matters such as this one.</p>

  <p>He might be naughty in front of his father, but he always respected Yudie enough to be obedient to her.</p>

  <p>But, as he grew up, he developed a mind of his own.</p>

  <p>In the past, when Luo Nian returned to the Immortal Mansion, he raised the same issue but was rejected. And now, he mentioned it again in front of Luo Zheng in hopes of a positive response.</p>

  <p>Yudie then directed her cold stare at Luo Zheng and waited to see what her husband had to say.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng could sense the pressure from Yudie, he still smiled and nodded. "I agree."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng... You..."</p>

  <p>Hearing his decision, and watching the father and son rejoice made Yudie shake with anger. She clenched her fists tightly and glared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian has grown up. He is now a warrior at the True God Realm. It is inappropriate for him to be trapped in my inner world his entire life," Luo Zheng said, trying to reason with her.</p>

  <p>Of course, Yudie understood what Luo Zheng was trying to say, but as a mother, worrying about her son came as second nature to her.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to refute, Luo Zheng added, "Moreover, Luo Nian has his pursuits in life. If you always protect him under your wings, it would hinder his growth."</p>

  <p>Yudie was a mother, and Luo Zheng understood her predicament. She would always want her son to be safe. However, he was old enough now, and they had to let him go so that he could explore the world by himself.</p>

  <p>Clap, clap, clap...</p>

  <p>"Dad, you are right!"</p>

  <p>Watching his father take a stand for him made Luo Nian clap his hands cheerily.</p>

  <p>Conflicting emotions welled up inside of Yudie. Now that Luo Nian looked so happy to leave, her eyes turned red as tears began to roll down her face.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian couldn't help but feel a little flustered at the sight of his mother's tears.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian, you'd better go out first. Let me talk to your mother. You have my word for it. If you can reach the consummate True God Realm, I will let you out," Luo Zheng promised.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Nian nodded and immediately left the room.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng approached Yudie with careful steps, and then he wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her towards him to console her. Gently he rubbed her shoulders and told her the situation in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>With Luo Nian's current cultivation level, it would not be hard for him to grab a position in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. It wouldn't be as dangerous as she had imagined if he remained in the domain of the human race.</p>

  <p>As she collected herself, she realized Luo Zheng was not wrong. If she kept him protected in Luo Zheng's inner world, she would be refusing him a chance of further development.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Zheng a while to calm Yudie down. She finally smiled through her tears and wiped them off.</p>

  <p>After handling Luo Nian's matter, Luo Zheng stayed with Yudie in the Immortal Mansion for a few hours before he dispersed his avatar and returned to the Source World.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate in both the Immortal Mansion and the Source World was the same. It was already dawn outside when Luo Zheng opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Carefully, he rolled up the yellow paper and put it away with the paper Luo Nian had worked out from the Sanskrit words. Then he removed the flag and headed back to Dragon City.</p>

  <p>According to the rule, he was supposed to return the yellow paper today.</p>

  <p>When Wilfred, who guarded the Truth Library, saw him come to turn in the yellow paper, he naturally inquired, "So what did you learn from the yellow paper?". In response, Luo Zheng shrugged, "I learned nothing." Wilfred responded in a sympathetic tone, "I expected that. It's a pity you wasted several million divine crystals for it."</p>

  <p>After giving the yellow paper back, Luo Zheng returned to the entrance of the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>He already had enough people following him. Back then, he received the task of guarding the Blue Cloud City. Although he failed, it was not his fault. So anyone who managed to survive was considered to have completed the task. Therefore, he had enough merit points.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had made his decision to go up the mountain, so being promoted to an Alliance Chief meant nothing to him.</p>

  <p>The only issue was, his decision affected his followers. If he were to give up his position, they would have to turn to other Flag Masters.</p>

  <p>On the side of the entrance of the Dragon City, Luo Zheng saw the old man again.</p>

  <p>The old man seemed to have anticipated Luo Zheng would come to return his flag.</p>

  <p>"After you become an Alliance Chief, all your followers can enter and exit the Dragon City freely. That would be good for you. But if you go up the mountain, you have to return the flag of Alliance Chief."</p>

  <p>After hearing his words, Luo Zheng was taken by surprise and asked, "How do you know I'm going up the mountain?"</p>

  <p>The old man smiled lightly and did not answer his question. Instead, he suggested, "You'd better choose a competent warrior to take over your position. Since you have a reputation in the Dragon City, no one dares to challenge your followers. You should select one to take over your place just like Milo did."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng happened to have the same idea.</p>

  <p>But to select a capable warrior was harder than it seemed...</p>

  <p>Now under a dilemma, Luo Zheng began to think hard.</p>

  <p>He had considered Gant at first, but he was not capable enough.</p>

  <p>"Monica is a Grand Flag Master. If she makes more efforts, she can become an Alliance Chief with her own strength. It is also reasonable to let her become an Alliance Chief in advance," the old man suggested observing Luo Zheng's predicament.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master Monica? She can be the one..."</p>

  <p>Monica had proved a huge help for Luo Zheng when he was still new to Dragon City. At times, she even assisted him in protecting his men. She was indeed the best choice out of the rest.</p>

  <p>"If you agree, I'll directly register the flag of Alliance Chief under Monica's name right now," the old man continued.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grinned warmly and responded, "That is so thoughtful of you. You must really want me to go up the mountain as quickly as possible, right?"</p>

  <p>"You never belonged here in the Dragon City, and since you joined our Taiyi Heaven Palace, you deserve better treatment," the old man said flatly.</p>

  <p>"In that case, I'll take my leave. Thank you for everything," Luo Zheng said as he bowed respectfully towards him.</p>

  <p>On the outskirts of the Dragon City, wilderness bloomed at its finest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng requested Beldene to gather all his followers, and at the same time, he also asked Monica to come to see him.</p>

  <p>"What's going on, Luo Zheng? Why did you ask to gather everyone?" Monica asked, giving in to her curiosity.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood just as confused.</p>

  <p>When she was in front of him, Luo Zheng proceeded to lightly tap his space ring, and a flag flew towards her. "From now on, this belongs to you," he said.</p>

  <p>Monica grabbed the flag and eyed it up with a confused expression on her face. "The flag of Alliance Chief?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in acknowledgment. "I have transferred the merit points to you.</p>

  <p>From now on, you are a new Alliance Chief of the Dragon City. And I entrust you with my followers."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the warriors who just joined him not long ago felt fine and accepted Monica as their new leader.</p>

  <p>However, for the disciples of the Sword Light Palace like Beldene and Elgin, it was hard to digest.</p>

  <p>Specially Kenelm, he wasted no time and asked, "Flag Master Luo Zheng, are you leaving the Dragon City?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and said, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Wow..."</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Light Palace all began to debate among themselves.</p>

  <p>After all Luo Zheng had done for them in the past, it was hard for them to accept someone else in his stead. It was all because of Luo Zheng that they had entered the Dragon City and could cultivate in peace.</p>

  <p>How could they process the fact that Luo Zheng was leaving?</p>

  <p>Compared to the rest, Gant looked the calmest. When he saw Qiu Yinhe come, he had already anticipated Luo Zheng would leave Dragon City to go up the mountain someday.</p>

  <p>In fact, it bothered him how Luo Zheng had stayed in the Dragon City for this long.</p>

  <p>"Since you are leaving Dragon City, are you going up the mountain?"</p>

  <p>Beldene asked.</p>

  <p>The disciples were all well-informed about the structure of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. They had stayed in the Dragon City for over a year and it was not difficult to get information about the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to stand out in the Dragon City, there were only two ways: either go up the mountain or join the Taiyi Guards.</p>

  <p>To become a Taiyi Guard, one had to become an Alliance Chief first, and then take the test that was held annually. Now that Luo Zheng had directly passed the position of the Alliance Chief to Monica, it was obvious what his intentions were.</p>
