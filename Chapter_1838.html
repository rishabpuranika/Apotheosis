<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Han Liusu was extremely intelligent. She quickly guessed what Kennan was thinking and coldly said, "Kennan, I'll make sure you will result to nothing if you take me away by force! And I mean it!"</p>

  <p>"This... Your Highness, please do not make things difficult for me,"</p>

  <p>Kennan said as he cupped his hands.</p>

  <p>"It's you who are making things difficult for me! Remember, in the end, I am still the master and you are still a servant!" Han Liusu shot back. She was truly afraid that Kennan would suddenly do something to seal her six senses and take her away by force. In that way, she wouldn't be able to resist at all.</p>

  <p>Hesitation dawned on Kennan and the other world lords behind him at Liusu's words. As servants, they had relied on the Han Clan's power to become what they were today. However, they would encounter this kind of dilemma too many times.</p>

  <p>When Han Liusu saw Kennan's conflicted expression, she smiled slightly and said, "Don't be so conflicted, Kennan. Believe me this time. I'm sure my hunch is right now!"</p>

  <p>In turn, Kennan hesitated for a moment before he took out a few more purple trial tallies. "Since Your Highness wants to mess around like this, we have no other choice…" he said with a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>There would be dire consequences if they went back without the Princess Royal. However, since she was determined to stay and follow Luo Zheng, they had to stay and accompany her, too. Thus, they had to waste of a few purple trial tallies.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng didn't involve himself in the dispute since it didn't have to do much with him.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had used the strange powerful flame to help Luo Zheng to refine his body, and Luo Zheng had agreed to help her in return. He would take her to the Soul Suppressing Cliff if there was a chance, even though he didn't know where that place was.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had never forgotten that he had entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for cultivation. His main goal was to become stronger…</p>

  <p>The sky turned an inky black and flames glittered in the darkness. Night fell, and the bonfires were set ablaze again.</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Zheng headed to the square and heartily filled his stomach up!</p>

  <p>The cultivation in the Collapsing Mountain race seemed so simple and casual. The more they ate, the faster their strength would grow.</p>

  <p>And so, Luo Zheng ate food that was thrice his weight almost every day!</p>

  <p>Such an appetite was surprising for an ordinary martial artist. After all, the stomach had a limited capacity. In the Collapsing Mountain race however, it was necessary for warriors to use their own strength to digest as much of the food in their stomachs as possible in a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's appetite was shocking compared to that of the martial artists from various races, but it still couldn't compare to that of the Collapsing Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>A child from the Collapsing Mountain race could devour meat five times what Luo Zheng could eat, while a full-grown Collapsing Mountain warrior could devour a meal that was almost the same size as a small mountain.</p>

  <p>Their terrifying ability to digest food had resulted to their equally terrifying bodies and unimaginable strength. It was also the race's foundation to gain a foothold in this world.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Kennan and his group looked at each other in dismay when they saw that Luo Zheng was qualified to eat his meals in front of the biggest bonfire in the square. If they remembered correctly, only Pascal had the right to eat here back then, and that was where the leader of the Collapsing Mountain race ate.</p>

  <p>From this situation, it could be said that the Collapsing Mountain race did tell the truth. This Luo Zheng seemed to be really important to them.</p>

  <p>However, Kennan and his group were all focused on Han Liusu. They clearly knew that the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance was extremely torturous, so they first needed to satisfy the Princess Royal's stomach.</p>

  <p>However, they thought that although the food contained the meat of strange beasts, it still wasn't qualified to be served to the Princess Royal.</p>

  <p>Then again, they couldn't find better dishes for her at the moment, so they had to settle for what was available.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Take it away!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of here!"</p>

  <p>Never would they expect that Han Liusu would flat out refuse the exquisite pieces of meat Kennan and the other warriors with him brought to her.</p>

  <p>"But Your Highness, this Calamity Dispelling Fragrance can increase your appetite a hundred times more than normal. Do you really not want to eat the food?" Kennan thought it was quite strange. He didn't believe that Han Liusu could resist the hunger under the influence of the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance. Even he himself couldn't resist it, so let alone the Princess Royal.</p>

  <p>"I will not eat it! You just have to take care of yourselves and leave me alone!" Han Liusu ordered coldly. Not too far away, the martial artists who lay on the ground began to cry as they heard her words.</p>

  <p>They had dreamed of having a bite of some food for far too long. How could the woman waste such delicious food!</p>

  <p>Kennan was confused, but the Princess Royal insisted on not eating.</p>

  <p>They had no choice but to retreat. They were even more confused at the moment. Could it be that the Princess Royal was really able to withstand the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance?</p>

  <p>Not long after, Kennan saw Luo Zheng slowly moved over from the bonfire and took out chunks of meat, tore them into pieces, and fed them to the Princess Royal. Only then did Kennan realize why the Princess Royal had refused to take the food brought to her by him and other warriors.</p>

  <p>When Kennan's eyes landed on the Princess Royal's smiling face, he felt even more conflicted.</p>
