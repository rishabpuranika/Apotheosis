<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The mood of the two warriors was extremely complicated.</p>

  <p>They discovered that the sharp sword intent contained within the words had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>The source of this problem must be Luo Zheng. They could not think of anyone else.</p>

  <p>But they did not dare stop Luo Zheng and force him to reveal the truth.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he probably did not know what the truth was. It was possible that he was unaware of what he'd done.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they could only watch Zheng's retreating figure and continue to stare at the words on the giant rock in a daze.</p>

  <p>After losing the sharp sword intent, these large characters lost their charm although they still looked the same as before. Even the brush edges of the characters were no longer sharp and forceful.</p>

  <p>If someone had said that this poem was carved by a Supreme Lord, the onlookers would have nodded in agreement. After all, only a Supreme Lord could carve such sharp characters.</p>

  <p>But now, if others were to see it, they would think that it was carved by an ordinary craftsman. There was nothing special or extraordinary about it. It almost looked disappointing, if they were being completely honest.</p>

  <p>"That brat took away the charm in those characters. What exactly is going on?" Landry asked with a sullen face.</p>

  <p>Damian shook his head, his expression dispirited.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, a crack suddenly appeared on one of the characters. The two men were shocked.</p>

  <p>This huge rock had never been damaged by anyone before. But a crack appeared just now. Wasn't this extremely abnormal?</p>

  <p>The two of them looked at each other with excitement written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>They were the only two among the countless warriors that had stayed here to the end. Perhaps what was happening in front of them was the turning point in their fates.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng did not know that the characters cracked after he left.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at his destination, he saw magnificent ancient buildings that stood there for countless years.</p>

  <p>Yolande and a couple dozen other people were waiting in this place.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, there is still one more person from the Mist Palace who has yet to come. It has already been several hours. If he still hasn't arrived, then I'll have to seal the Purification Pool!" said an old man dressed in cotton clothes. He had an impatient expression on his face.</p>

  <p>To any warrior of the thirteen palaces, Passing the Torch was a great fortune. But there was actually someone who was yet to arrive, and it was unknown just what he was waiting for. The old man grew frustrated and angry.</p>

  <p>Yolande shrugged and said, "Just wait."</p>

  <p>A tall and slim woman dressed in jade-green sneered. "Tsk! Tsk!</p>

  <p>Yolande, I'm so envious of you. If it were someone from other palaces, I'm afraid the Purification Pool would have already been sealed!"</p>

  <p>This time, all the leaders of the thirteen palaces had rushed over from thirteen different supreme worlds to participate in Passing the Torch. The woman dressed in jade-green was the leader of the Shadow Palace.</p>

  <p>Actually, what she said was right. The old man was very impatient, and he hated those who were late. According to the rules, he would seal the Purification Pool even if someone had been late for only five minutes.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had already been late for several hours now.</p>

  <p>As much as he wanted to seal the Purification Pool, he couldn't do so because Yolande was the daughter of a Supreme Lord. He had no choice but to wait against his will.</p>

  <p>At this time, another warrior also said to Yolande, "Why do you want to wait for this guy, Yolande? I don't think it's a big deal if he misses it.</p>

  <p>Could it be that there's something really special about him? I can't think of any other reason why we are waiting for him for this long."</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of warriors in each palace participating in Passing the Torch. When the other twelve leaders saw that Yolande insisted on waiting for Luo Zheng, they became very interested in his identity. They wanted to know his background and true power. There was definitely something that Yolande was keeping from them.</p>

  <p>Yolande pursed her lips. Deep in her heart, she had high hopes for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, since she knew that Luo Zheng had his own fate, she would not interfere with his thoughts. She would just let him do whatever he wanted. She wondered if he had succeeded in comprehending Supreme Lord Sword's sword intent.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, why is that brat so late? Shouldn't he have come with you?" another person asked. "There are so many leaders here, yet we are waiting for a mere disciple. Do you think this is appropriate?"</p>

  <p>According to the rules, this place had to be sealed once all the participants entered. Since Luo Zheng was still not here, the place couldn't be sealed. These people were all leaders and very proud. How could they not be angry when they had been delayed by a mere disciple? To them, this was utter disrespect.</p>

  <p>"That brat might be trying to comprehend that poem of Supreme Lord Sword. It would take thousands of years." It was Timothy, the vice leader of the Mist Palace, who spoke.</p>

  <p>Hearing Timothy's words, many palace leaders had strange expressions on their faces as they all stared at Yolande in disbelief.</p>

  <p>These palace leaders all heard of the mysteries of Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>Whether or not it was a scam, they had their own opinions. But they believed that smarter warriors would never waste their entire lives on it.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I never thought that there would be such a stupid guy in the Mist Palace. He actually believes in the secret of Supreme Lord Sword!" a palace master exclaimed, laughing.</p>

  <p>Another palace leader sneered and said to Yolande, "It can't be that you want us to wait for a thousand years, right?"</p>

  <p>Of course, this was a sarcastic remark. Yolande was furious, but she could only urge Luo Zheng with her life vitality. Before she could speak, though, a figure had already rushed over from the horizon.</p>

  <p>When she saw Luo Zheng coming, Yolande let out a sigh of relief and said,</p>

  <p>"He's already here."</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng landed, he cupped his hands towards Yolande and said, "My apologies for the long wait!"</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded her head slightly, but before she could say anything, the old man spoke. "Long wait? Humph, you don't have the qualifications to make us wait for you."</p>

  <p>His tone was quite unkind, but Luo Zheng was indeed late and didn't say much.</p>

  <p>What the old man said was right, after all. As a mere Life and Death Realm warrior, he didn't have the qualifications to inconvenience these people, let alone make them wait.</p>

  <p>The other palace leaders and vice palace leaders also furrowed their brows as they stared at Luo Zheng. They had not expected that after waiting for so long, they would only see a warrior at the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm. Was there really no other talent in the Mist Palace? Or was it because he had some sort of special background?</p>

  <p>"Since you're here, hurry and enter the Purification Pool," Yolande said in a low voice. "The others have already left for a few hours. You are already far behind."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head and looked in the direction Yolande was pointing at. He saw a circular pool.</p>

  <p>There was clear water in this pool� so clear that the bottom could be seen. The Mu Ning that was being emitted from this pool reminded Luo Zheng of the Ascending Well he had stayed in before.</p>

  <p>Everyone was urging him to get a move on and Luo Zheng was unwilling to make things difficult for Yolande any more than he already had. Without further ado, he jumped into the Purification Pool so fast that his figure appeared to have flashed right before everyone's eyes. But the moment he jumped in, he discovered that the clear water in the pool wasn't as simple as it seemed. The resistance of the clear water was much greater than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>After he jumped in, he expected that he would sink, but he remained on the surface of the pool.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng having trouble with it, Yolande said, "You can sink down.</p>

  <p>The Purification Pool will help clear up your soul for a short period of time and increase your perception by several folds!"</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng didn't know was that the warriors from the thirteen palaces had had a round of competition in the Purification Pool.</p>

  <p>The Purification Pool's water buoyancy was extremely great. It was only twenty feet wide and twenty feet deep, yet it was already this resistant. If its area was expanded by several times, even a mountain range would still be unable to sink down.</p>

  <p>Many warriors were proud about being able to sink to the bottom so as to show their strength.</p>

  <p>But this was not such an easy feat. Most of the warriors in the thirteen palaces couldn't sink to the bottom of the Purification Pool, and most of them only stayed in the middle section.</p>

  <p>Of course, the thirteen palaces didn't lack powerful warriors. Just like Layla, Javier, and the other warriors, they had seamlessly sunk to the bottom. There were more than ten warriors in the thirteen palaces that were able to overcome the challenge.</p>

  <p>In truth, it didn't matter whether or not one was able to sink to the bottom. This was only a way for warriors of the thirteen palaces to compete with each other.</p>

  <p>"Young man, you can try and see how deep you can go," a palace leader said to Luo Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Yolande. "Is it really that important to sink to the bottom?" he mouthed.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Yolande shook her head slightly, Luo Zheng did not bother to pay attention to the palace leader who had just spoken to him. With a flip of his body, he entered the Purification Pool without sinking to the bottom.</p>

  <p>The palace leaders, including the old man who just offered him a smile, started to frown in disappointment. What a huge let down this was! They had waited for a very long time only for the sake of this guy.</p>
