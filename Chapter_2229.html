<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't give Grover any time to think.</p>

  <p>His goal was to end this battle as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Grover's martial arts skill was very mysterious and there was no way Luo Zheng would be able to break it even if he came up with a clever method to do so.</p>

  <p>Not unless he went the other route. As the saying went, "a man of great strength can defeat ten men of martial arts."</p>

  <p>Basically, instead of brains, Luo Zheng could use his brute physical body in order to break his opponent's martial arts skill and then use his powerful strength to suppress them. He'd use his soul attack if necessary. With Zheng's current strength, it was almost too unfair for the proving godly warriors to fight with him.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Zheng could barely fight against Pranav and others like him.</p>

  <p>Pranav was a low-rank True God but, because he was Murphy's disciple, his real strength was on par with mid-rank True Gods!</p>

  <p>Given Zheng's current strength, he would barely be able to contend against an ordinary mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>At this stage, he had no motivation at all to challenge warriors above his level. The additional, cumulative points awarded for successive wins were more appealing to him and it seemed a wiser choice to obtain points from fights with proving godly warriors in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>With his quick reflexes, Luo Zheng managed to grab Grover's hands and channeled his immense power towards his opponent. There was no resisting this attack and thus, Grover was brutally halved.</p>

  <p>The victory inevitably went to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite his winning, Luo Zheng didn't think too much of it and quickly got out of the arena.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he turned he was frozen in shock by the dense crowd that had formed behind him.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of beauties stood staring at him. It seemed his match garnered quite a bit of attention and there were also numerous whispers from the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Twenty seven consecutive wins..."</p>

  <p>"His current opponents should be the most powerful proving godly warriors from the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands."</p>

  <p>"His points are rising so fast! This battle gets him two hundred points!"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of these female disciples, Luo Zheng was somewhat of a freak. He didn't possess the Purple Power Body yet he entered the Purple Soul Hall. Back when the master was speaking he casually stepped up and encouraged everyone, and now, they all discovered his real strength which was extremely powerful!</p>

  <p>How long could he keep his winning streak?</p>

  <p>After finding out that his battle with Grover easily earned him two hundred and forty points, Luo Zheng immediately wondered just how many points he'd manage to get if he kept winning.</p>

  <p>Despite the gazes of so many beauties focused on him, Luo Zheng merely ignored them and continued to immerse himself in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>In the Floating Islands, each noble clan had someone specially assigned to observe the changes on the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>If one's ranking suddenly rose, the wealthy clans would know and they would then pay close attention to that certain someone.</p>

  <p>And the only way they could observe the warriors' performance was through the rankings on the Jade Wall of Legends. Ranked first among the proving godly warriors was Donovan Jiang of the Jiang Clan, second was Aleyna of the Han Clan, and third was the Menachem Lei of the Lei Clan.</p>

  <p>Grover, who Luo Zheng fought just now, was ranked sixth. His defeat saw the reduction of his points and had him drop all the way to twelfth place.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had a ranking, he would've surpassed Donovan Jiang by now with his current points.</p>

  <p>However, the rules made it so that he did not appear in the rankings. He fought twenty-seven battles in a row but had not lost once so he couldn't be listed. Luo Zheng was, effectively, an invisible person who continuously gathered points under the radar.</p>

  <p>Those defeated by him could only mutter their regrets in their hearts.</p>

  <p>These people also had a record of consecutive wins but now they could only bide their time and hope to defeat him someday. When that happened then his points would once again return to normal.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's winning streak was unstoppable.</p>

  <p>The young man would go on to win three more matches that very same day, making it a thirty-one match winning streak. His points were now at three thousand!</p>

  <p>With this, Luo Zheng was not far off from achieving his goal of obtaining eight thousand points but that was if he continued winning. One lost battle and he would lose more than ninety percent of his points!</p>

  <p>As everyone tried their best to get points, the Purple Soul Hall announced the awards for those who got good rankings in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>It was with great relief that Joy saw all the disciples of Purple Soul Hall work hard on gaining more points. She came up with a good idea to reward their efforts. As the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan for so many years now, she no doubt had a lot of good stuff in her inventory that she presented to the disciples.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a look at her prizes and was quite impressed. There was an eye-catching, silver gossamer sword that he was particularly enamored with.</p>

  <p>According to Joy, the treasures would be distributed according to the number of points one had. The one who earned the most in three months would be the first to choose the award, then the second would choose the second award, and so on and so forth.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng kept up his winning streak then he might be able to get first pick!</p>

  <p>After Joy presented her awards, the main Han Clan also followed with their own.</p>

  <p>The ranking seemed very important to the Han Clan. Since Joy took out some treasures from her personal collection as a way to motivate the disciples of Purple Soul Hall, the Han Clan also saw it fit to offer rewards.</p>

  <p>Out of curiosity, Luo Zheng headed over to Holy Emperor City to see what exactly the Han Clan offered. As he viewed the rewards, one particular treasure caught his attention.</p>

  <p>The wares offered by Joy were eye-catching. There was no doubt that the Demi-holy Being was rich but her wealth was nothing compared to the main Han Clan.</p>

  <p>It was worth noting that the Han Clan was even willing to sacrifice Purple Soul Hall to enhance their ranking so it was no surprise that they wouldn't even blink an eye when it came to offering up their own treasures.</p>

  <p>Over thirty supreme primordial weapons were lined up in the huge hall, all to serve as rewards for the promising warriors that raked up the most points.</p>

  <p>A mixture of shock and greed danced in the eyes of every True God that entered the hall, however, there were some who didn't even think that much of these supreme primordial weapons. Luo Zheng was one of these said people.</p>

  <p>Instead, he was more focused on what was on top of the hall.</p>

  <p>Five treasures were lined up in a row up there: a jade sword, a pair of scissors, a mirror, a palm-sized tripod, and in the center, a bronze lion statue!</p>

  <p>These five treasures all emitted a peculiar power. Everyone could only stare up in awe from below.</p>

  <p>"No wonder the Holy Emperor decided to disband the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>In order to enhance everyone's rankings, the Holy Emperor even took out the best treasures!"</p>

  <p>"Have the rules of the Floating Islands changed? The Han Clan didn't pay that much attention to rankings before..."</p>

  <p>"The Crystalmoor Mirror! I've been dreaming of possessing such a treasure! I never expected the Han Clan to offer it as a reward."</p>

  <p>Numerous mid-rank True Gods, and even some top-rank True Gods, salivated over the five treasures.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't the five treasures that attracted Luo Zheng per se.</p>

  <p>No, he was instead focused on the bronze lion statue, rather, what it was placed on. Below the statue where it was prostrated was a huge, cyan plate.</p>

  <p>This plate obviously had a bit of history. Luo Zheng didn't recognize the material it was made of but his inner world clearly showed a strong desire for it. This plate was actually made of that special mud.</p>

  <p>His failure of condensing a Godly Tile had always been a cause of concern for him.</p>

  <p>He got his chance back in Six-Burden Divine City but he had almost lost his life. It was just too difficult to find that kind of mud again.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't find any more of that special mud then his cultivation level would be doomed at the world lord level. It was understandable that he felt extremely depressed by this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng never thought he'd get another shot after finding this cyan plate here! He was extremely grateful that luck was in his favor.</p>

  <p>These five treasures were all superior to the thirty-odd supreme primordial weapons below. The bronze lion statue also seemed to be the best reward out of the five which meant it was going to be extremely difficult to obtain.</p>

  <p>"Sir, may I know the requirements to get this year's rewards? For example, the bronze lion statue at the top..." Luo Zheng asked the mid-rank True God beside him.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God had been staring blankly at the treasures but was jolted back to reality by Zheng's question. "Bronze lion statue? Oh! You mean the Golden Beast Statue! Those five treasures are only for the disciples of the main Han Clan. Ordinary people don't have the qualifications to obtain them."</p>
