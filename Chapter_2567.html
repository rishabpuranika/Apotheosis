  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were two particular sections that divided the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The ordinary Nine Li members used the outer area as a residence, while the inner layer served as their venue for cultivation.</p>

  <p>People who filled the place were the most outstanding warriors of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Grow!"</p>

  <p>On a spacious muster station by the side of a cultivation place, a figure of a young man could be seen growing by the minute.</p>

  <p>In just a blink of an eye, that same man's body had increased hundreds of times bigger than it already was. In such a short time, he managed to grow up to about three to four hundred feet tall.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Hey!"</p>

  <p>With his now larger extremities, the boy began bellowing and kicking in the air. He then casually kicked up a stone lock on the side of the muster station.</p>

  <p>Each stone lock was extremely heavy and was exceptionally tall like a mountain. When the young man finally seized the stone lock, his expression turned feral.</p>

  <p>Loads of younger Nine Li members stared in awe as the figure hovered over them.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Kiran never fails to impress!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed. They say Kiran is to undergo the Body Tribulations. Once he's through with the process, he would be able to use the Nine Li Wild Body then."</p>

  <p>"What a powerful sixth-grade bloodline..."</p>

  <p>In the past thousands of years, Kiran was the second Wild God who possessed the sixth-grade blood in the Chiyou race.</p>

  <p>Obtaining such a talent wasn't easy for the Nine Li race, that was why they trained him to the best of their abilities.</p>

  <p>However, Kiran was too young to represent the Nine Li race during fights.</p>

  <p>"Phew! Phew!"</p>

  <p>Accompanied by Giacomo, Luo Zheng slowly walked towards Kiran who was playing with the stone lock. With a hint of admiration in his eyes, Luo Zheng said, "This kid sure is young, but he already has reached such a level. A young Nine Li talent, indeed."</p>

  <p>Besides the exiles, the people Luo Zheng had seen since he entered the Nine Li race were also rather complex beings.</p>

  <p>Even ordinary Nine Li warriors were stronger than Wild Gods in the outside, let alone someone with the likes of Erik and Giacomo. Their strength could altogether sweep through a city in one swift move.</p>

  <p>"He still has a long way to go. We all know how hard it is to cultivate in the Wild God system," said Giacomo.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Even if he had cultivated the Wild God Power as a shortcut, he knew quite well that it wasn't easy to succeed in this path.</p>

  <p>With just one wave of the stone lock, Kiran's movement sped up. He went on like a madman until his body lost its balance.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What's up with that? Ah! This boy?" Upon seeing that, Giacomo realized that something terrible was about to happen.</p>

  <p>Despite the rapid progress that Kiran had made during his cultivation, it was inevitable that during the process when Wild Gods cultivated, their bodies would constantly expand.</p>

  <p>It would take a certain time for them to adapt to such a drastic body size increase. After all, everyone's perception of size rooted in their experiences. Even activities like walking could become a challenge for some of the Wild Gods that had absorbed enough Wild God Power and had their body sizes doubled.</p>

  <p>For Kiran, it was the same problem.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Kiran dropped to the ground with a roaring thud.</p>

  <p>Such an impact caused the entire muster station to shake.</p>

  <p>Almost as if it was precisely calculated, the mountain-sized stone lock crashed into the other side where dozens of Nine Li younglings gathered.</p>

  <p>Those kids didn't activate the Wild God Power in their bodies at that certain time. The weight of the stone lock could be unbearable for them.</p>

  <p>Upon impact, they all could turn into a puddle of meat paste.</p>

  <p>"This doesn't look good!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Giacomo had already conjured up the Wild God Power in his body. In just a short amount of time, his body doubled in size.</p>

  <p>Without second thoughts, he rushed towards the falling stone lock.</p>

  <p>Despite the short distance between him and the stone lock, he was too late. It all happened too fast.</p>

  <p>Dumbfounded by the events that unfolded before him, Kiran could only stare blankly at the moving stone as he sat on the bumpy ground. As he thought of the worst possibilities that could happen, he closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was clear to Luo Zheng that the stone lock was getting closer and closer to the young Nine Li members, and he had also noticed that Giacomo wasn't able to catch up with it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched his arm and for a second, it looked like he was grabbing onto the air.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>It sounded like the stone lock had hit an invisible wall. It suddenly began to fall down vertically.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Due to the collision, countless cracks began to appear on the surface of the stone lock. Finally, it broke into a heap of debris that quickly scattered all over the ground below.</p>

  <p>Both Giacomo and Kiran stopped dead in their tracks. "What?,"</p>

  <p>Giacomo couldn't even form a coherent sentence.</p>

  <p>The young Nine Li members who initially thought they were doomed were now stunned by what they had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>"Now that? That is pure and genuine strength." Giacomo's eyes glinted in surprise. With a hint of disbelief in his voice, he turned to Luo Zheng and said, "So you can actually use your power to such an extent, huh?"</p>

  <p>In terms of power, the strength source that Luo Zheng had just used wasn't enough to catch Giacomo's attention. However, it was still impressive. If they were in the same realm, the power of a Wild God was still considered stronger than that of a True God.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter was, once the Wild God Power was completely fused into a cultivator's body, it was impossible to separate them. It was a pure body refining method, and extracting the power from the body was unachievable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could use the strength source of the Nine Divine Stars. Furthermore, he was able to comprehend the Power Shaping, the token beyond way.</p>

  <p>He could control the invisible power as he pleased. That kind of control over colossal power left Giacomo in awe.</p>

  <p>"I was aching to save those boys. Forgive me for that," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>With a gentle wave of his finger, the wall manifested by the strength source instantly dissipated.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Giacomo, I'm sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen..."</p>

  <p>Kiran sounded frantic. If he killed more than a dozen of his fellowmen, it would have been unforgivable.</p>

  <p>With furrowed eyebrows and a hard look, Giacomo retorted, "Don't make the same mistake again. Be more careful."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Kiran blinked a few times and left with the other younglings.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Giacomo wasn't able to get over the strength Luo Zheng had displayed.</p>

  <p>They decided to advance for a while, walking past the muster station. As they made their way, tall warehouses began to appear one by one. Those things extended to a distance and there might have been a thousand of them.</p>

  <p>Just as they approached the warehouses, Luo Zheng began to feel an intense Wild God Power radiating from those high buildings. "Are wild bones stored in these warehouses?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are," Giacomo responded, nodding his head softly.</p>

  <p>"That's a lot of wild bones!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, a little taken aback.</p>

  <p>The warehouses that stood before him were probably thousands of feet high, just how many wild bones could be stored in them?</p>

  <p>It surprised Luo Zheng to know that the resources owned by the Nine Li race were beyond his comprehension.</p>

  <p>"There are just too many wild bones and they are not very meaningful for us Nine Li race," Giacomo said flatly. "After all, the Wild God Power that everyone can absorb is limited. We ultimately have to face the Body Tribulations once the amount of Wild God Power we have absorbed has reached a certain level. If we can't go through the Body Tribulations, our cultivation won't improve regardless of how many wild bones we have absorbed."</p>

  <p>"Body Tribulations?" Luo Zheng was astounded. "What kind of tribulation is that?"</p>

  <p>Of course, he had heard about the life and death tribulation, and Heavenly Tribulation. However, he wasn't familiar with anything like Body Tribulations.</p>

  <p>The puzzled look on Giacomo's face surprised Luo Zheng beyond belief. He then asked in complete bewilderment, "Do you really not have the slightest idea of what the Body Tribulations are?"</p>
