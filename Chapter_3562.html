  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult to verify their conjecture from the one-eyed monster.</p>

  <p>When the one-eyed monster told the Insect Master race that the new stage ruler was a human being, all the Insect Masters had become excited.</p>

  <p>Only then did Mercer and Miller understand why the arrogant one-eyed monsters were treating them so politely.</p>

  <p>That night, all of the Insect Masters packed up and drove all kinds of poisonous insects and ants to move with the one-eyed monsters.</p>

  <p>A different fate awaited them. As the Insect Master race wasn't strong, they might not be able to achieve much in the Dark Region even if they were given more time. But under the protection of the one-eyed monsters, they wouldn't be as miserable as before. They could even dare to hope a little.</p>

  <p>It was peaceful in the Light Region of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore these days.</p>

  <p>The Sky Water City had previously been in chaos. It would collapse even without the attack of the Giants and the Guide Weasel race.</p>

  <p>However, the originally aggressive Giant race and Guide Weasel race had suddenly retreated to the Myriad Spirits City under Zheng's order. Many of the large races in the Sky Water City thought that the two races showed weakness and cowardice before the Star Falcon race.</p>

  <p>This naturally deepened the prestige that the Star Falcon race felt and they in turn intimidated many large races in the Sky Water City, which helped the Star Falcon race stabilize the situation.</p>

  <p>In the early hours of the morning, over one thousand White Apes had gathered outside the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>The White Ape race used to be part of the Sky Water City, but they were later expelled by the Star Falcon race.</p>

  <p>This time, Whitehead, from the White Ape race, helped the Star Falcon race find Yan and lead Zheng into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race, pleased with their contribution, bestowed on the White Ape race the right to enter the Sky Water City again. They also gave them a large area within the city.</p>

  <p>The leader of the White Ape race walked ahead, Whitehead closely following him.</p>

  <p>Whitehead looked like a hero coming back with great honor as he walked with his head held high.</p>

  <p>It was all thanks to him that the White Ape race had achieved what it had.</p>

  <p>The leader had even chosen him as his successor. After they entered the Sky Water City, the leader would let him succeed him as the new leader of the race.</p>

  <p>Two massive Star Falcons sat on the city wall, staring down from their perch. These were two elders of the Star Falcon race, Hanley and Tomas, who were guarding the city.</p>

  <p>When the Star Falcon race had lost, these two elders had taken charge of the situation and sent the six Star Falcons to take Yan away.</p>

  <p>"Hanley, why are you letting these losers enter the city?" Tomas said, staring at the White Apes disdainfully.</p>

  <p>The White Ape race had once been expelled from the Sky Water City and was no longer qualified to enter it.</p>

  <p>"The White Ape race helped us at a critical moment," Hanley answered in earnest.</p>

  <p>"So what? We can reward them accordingly. But if we allow such good-for-nothing creatures to enter the Sky Water City, other races will laugh at us,"</p>

  <p>Tomas said heatedly.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," Hanley said, his eyes shining shrewdly. "We have to let every race in the Sky Water City know that even now, there are forces that choose to follow us! We won't lose anything by giving the White Ape race a piece of land. What we are doing is killing two birds with one stone."</p>

  <p>Tomas nodded. "Is there still no news from the Dark Region?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Hanley shook his head. "All of these are trifles," he said, pointing at the White Apes below. "What I care most about is news of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The woman called Feng Ge is a purified being. I'm afraid even the Royal Monkey race will find it difficult to deal with her."</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Dark Region were generally stronger than those in the Light Region. But Feng Ge was a purified being, the nemesis of the creatures in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"The two human beings haven't returned yet. They must have died in the Dark Region!" Tomas said, "Don't forget that there is a stage ruler in the Dark Region!"</p>

  <p>At the mention of the stage ruler, Hanley's confidence increased.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race didn't know much about the Dark Region, but they had a general idea of what was going on there. The Royal Monkey race would most likely take advantage of the stage ruler and kill the two human beings.</p>

  <p>If the stage ruler were to really take action against them, they would have already died there.</p>

  <p>"I'll send someone to the Dark Region to inquire about it," Hanley said, nodding.</p>

  <p>Hanley felt a sudden tremor under his feet before the whole wall began to shake.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Tomas's eyes were wide as saucers, surprised.</p>

  <p>The members of the White Ape race that had entered the Sky Water City one by one, also looked up at the shaking city wall.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?" the leader of the White Ape race said.</p>

  <p>Not knowing what was going on, Whitehead turned around and shouted,</p>

  <p>"Members of the White Ape race! Hurry up! Enter the city as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that the sound of something being ripped apart echoed through the air. A huge crack, extending from the top to the bottom of the wall, appeared just a few feet away from them.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>With a resounding boom, a part of the city wall collapsed, and four figures appeared beside it. Zheng and his companions had arrived.</p>

  <p>Whitehead paled at the sight of these people. He knew something bad was going to happen. The Star Falcons were also shocked at the sight of Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you all can leave the Other Shore first," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yan's and Natalie's Souls of Light were still too weak. They would be in danger if they were to remain in the midst of a chaotic battle.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Yan acquiesced.</p>

  <p>"Remember! It's that White Ape! It is that White Ape that killed Naomi!"</p>

  <p>Natalie said, jabbing a finger towards Whitehead.</p>

  <p>Before this, both Natalie and Yan hadn't understood why, when the Pear Hill and the White Ape race were on good terms, Whitehead had chosen to betray them. They had their answer now. He had betrayed them just to return to the Sky Water City!</p>

  <p>Natalie and Yan soon left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>A howling sounded through the skies.</p>

  <p>More than ten Star Falcons had spread their wings and were headed straight for Zheng.</p>

  <p>These Star Falcons were the guards of the Sky Water City. They didn't know why Zheng and the others had come here and were treating them merely as ordinary intruders.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed at these Star Falcons. He stomped his feet and turned into a lightning arc, shooting towards the guards.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>The lightning arc continually cut through the group of Star Falcons. Before anybody could react, charred bodies of the guards began to rain down into the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>With a crack, the lightning flashed in a huge arc in the air and struck the ground at Whitehead's feet, emitting a burst of thunder and causing the members of the White Ape race to clap their hands over their ears that had begun to ring.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure appeared in the lightning, his eyes cold. "You cooperated with the Star Falcon race and kidnapped my sister just to get a foothold in the Sky Water City. How could you be so reckless?"</p>

  <p>"I... I..." Whitehead was beginning to panic. He was beating a hasty retreat but looked up at the sky from time to time.</p>

  <p>"Are you counting on the Star Falcon race to save you?" Zheng sneered, "I defeated the entire Star Falcon race on my own. Don't you know? Hans and Garth didn't even stand a chance to defeat me. The Star Falcon race asked you to take my sister away because there was no way out for them."</p>
