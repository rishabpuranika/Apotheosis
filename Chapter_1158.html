  <p>
</p>

  <p>In that moment, Fredric's nerves were also stretched taut. How could he not understand the arithmetic that Luo Zheng was talking about?</p>

  <p>The value of the Heavenly Thunder Halberd was simply impossible to measure within the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, perhaps the halberd was only worth several hundred thousand supreme life vitality crystals. But in the Lower World, no one could afford to buy it. All semi-divine weapons were priceless.</p>

  <p>The last time Fredric had used a halberd to protect himself, it had made his heart ache. Now he was going to use the last halberd against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The surface of the halberd had a circular red rune and emitted fragmented lightning. As long as he lightly pressed his finger on the rune, the activated halberd would keep shooting.</p>

  <p>His fingers were trembling. The pressure that Luo Zheng had on him was too great, to the point that he was beginning to lose consciousness.</p>

  <p>And right now, he really wanted to give up. He feared Luo Zheng instinctively.</p>

  <p>His instinct constantly reminded him that he should not go against this man because he was not someone he could afford to offend.</p>

  <p>However, another voice sounded out, "Kill him! Even if you have to use a halberd to kill him, it will be worth it. Your father will reward you generously."</p>

  <p>Blood pumped furiously from his heart to his veins. His eyes became bloodshot as his finger pressed down on the rune on the halberd.</p>

  <p>A rumble sounded and a shrill whistling sound emanated from the short halberd. It was extremely unpleasant to the ears.</p>

  <p>This was the sound of the lightning channeling through the body of the halberd. A gigantic bolt of lightning abruptly burst forth from the halberd's front.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! Bastard!" shouted Fredric loudly. He refused to swallow his pride, so he refused to yield to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although his voice was drowned out by the thunderous roar, Luo Zheng was still able to clearly hear him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, his entire body was covered by a thick bolt of lightning.</p>

  <p>This huge wave of lightning energy was like a river as it surged towards Luo Zheng and extended far into the distance.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Every divine-level talent was blinded by the dazzling light.</p>

  <p>The thick bolt of lightning destroyed everything in its way as it rushed towards the vast Feather Holy Sea. There were still a few faint golden lights on the surface of the Feather Holy Sea, which were dispersed under the intense influence of the lightning's power.</p>

  <p>The dazzling lightning lasted for a long time before gradually dissipating. They slowly opened their eyes and goggled at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still standing at where he was, without a scratch on his body.</p>

  <p>Even the mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm would find themselves in a difficult position when struck by such lightning.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng still looked faintly amused. Neither his expression nor his posture had changed in the slightest.</p>

  <p>A divine-level talent sighed as he saw this. "Is Luo Zheng an incarnation of God?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No one can defeat him. He's just reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but he's unharmed even under such a fierce attack. I'm afraid that he will dominate the entire great world some day in the future."</p>

  <p>"It's a power transfer. He stole it from the little monster, but the little monster himself couldn't use his power to this extent."</p>

  <p>After all, the Heavenly Thunder Halberd was a semi-divine weapon. His body was as strong as a sacred weapon, but he would not have been able to withstand the power of the lightning with his physical body alone.</p>

  <p>However, he had never intended to use his body from the start. The moment Fredric had activated the Heavenly Thunder Halberd, he had transferred all the injuries he had suffered into the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Although the Feather Holy Sea was just an inland sea, it covered a quite large area. It could dissolve even the greatest power of lightning, and the lightning that had struck Zheng's body couldn't cause any ripples in it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng released his soul pressure and took another step forward, shaking his head and saying, "You've suffered a huge loss in this business!"</p>

  <p>Fredric gritted his teeth as he looked at Luo Zheng, who was completely unharmed. His eyes burned with anger as he shouted, "So what? My father will definitely kill you! You can't possibly be a match for my father!"</p>

  <p>"I don't deny it," said Luo Zheng, nodding and taking another step forward.</p>

  <p>"Then why aren't you on your knees? I can beg my father to spare your life!" Fredric laughed, already caught up in the madness, his eyes showing heavy traces of paranoia.</p>

  <p>"You are not qualified." Luo Zheng stared with clear, calm eyes at Fredric, who seemed to be going crazy, and took another step forward.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A soft explosion sounded from Fredric's body.</p>

  <p>Countless fragments appeared on the gem of the Heart Condensation Necklace on his chest. The gem released an invisible enchanted barrier that blocked Zheng's soul pressure. But as Luo Zheng pressed forward, the gem was no longer able to withstand the intense pressure and finally broke apart.</p>

  <p>Fredric's soul was not much stronger than the other martial artists'.</p>

  <p>Without the protection of the gem, his fragile soul couldn't resist Zheng's pressure at all.</p>

  <p>In just three seconds, he felt the world spinning around him. His eyes rolled back as his body stiffened and he fainted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head as he looked at Fredric unconscious on the ground.</p>

  <p>But he had no intention of killing Fredric in the first place.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could resist the powerful attack from the Soul Sea Realm martial artists by combining the will of the world with his strength. But he was no match for those who already had domains. Once he was enveloped by a domain and the connection between him and the will of the world was severed, he simply wasn't a match for the Soul Sea Realm martial artists.</p>

  <p>That was why he didn't want to anger War Emperor York too much.</p>

  <p>All the divine-level talents looked fearfully at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They all knew that Luo Zheng was very strong. He had previously fought with Logan, Fiona, and the little monster in the arena. That was why they knew that Luo Zheng was strong, but none of them could tell how strong he exactly was.</p>

  <p>Now, they clearly understood how terrifying Zheng's strength was.</p>

  <p>As long as he had enough space and time, Luo Zheng would be able to annihilate all the divine-level talents present there, with his strength alone. The gap was no longer just one realm, but two realms, even though Luo Zheng was only in the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>"He fainted," Luo Zheng said with a smile. "Let's wait for him to wake up."</p>

  <p>Fiona let out a light breath and said, "There's no need. It's only 9, 000 life vitality crystals."</p>

  <p>It was a massive sum of money for Callan. Fiona was angry that her little brother had been tricked by Fredric and she just couldn't tolerate the insult. But when it came to true value, 9, 000 supreme life vitality crystals were nothing at all.</p>

  <p>Fredric had also paid a heavy price for those life vitality crystals. The Heavenly Thunder Halberd that he had used moments ago had an immeasurable value.</p>

  <p>Now, Fiona began to worry about Luo Zheng. He had already angered War Emperor York. If War Emperor York came to the Feather Emperor Secret Land, would he directly attack Luo Zheng? If it really came to that, she would help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If she stood out, her father would definitely support her. She had now made up her mind.</p>

  <p>"It's time to mine!"</p>

  <p>And as quickly as that, Luo Zheng put this matter at the back of his mind. He still had work to do. After absorbing so much heavenly essence and igniting over 10, 000 dragon scales, he was to smash the golden leaf to pieces, take out the Black Star, and then move on to the top of the mine tree.</p>

  <p>But this was what he had assumed would happen. What would most likely happen was that he wouldn't be able to break open the golden leaf, and as a result, wouldn't be able to take out the pickax, which was a supreme divine weapon.</p>
