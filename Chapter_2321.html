  <p>The Dark Fire Forbidden Area was a second-grade forbidden area. Most of the True Gods present had previous experience of going inside, and they all knew how powerful the Rhyme Butterflies could be.</p>

  <p>Aleyna, Luo Zheng and the others, on the other hand, weren't aware of it at first.</p>

  <p>After being reminded by Reginald and seeing the other True Gods making their moves, they naturally understood that the Rhyme Butterflies were very weak. The power came from the Spirit Burning Fire following the deaths of the Rhyme Butterflies. As long as they maintained a certain distance when killing the Rhyme Butterflies, they didn't have to worry about a thing.</p>

  <p>At the same time, an umbrella appeared in Aleyna's hand. She held onto it tightly. With a cracking sound, the umbrella snapped opened. With a flick, she rolled the umbrella in her hand, and it spun at a high speed.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Numerous light needles, at least the length of an entire arm, shot out from the umbrella and directed themselves toward the group of Rhyme Butterflies, like heavy rain.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly nailed to the ground, the Rhyme Butterflies immediately turned into flames that began to explode. The rising flames spread out, releasing a turbulent heat before rushing toward Aleyna. Before the flames could reach Aleyna though, the terrible heat had already burned the beautiful hair just above her forehead.</p>

  <p>She quickly used the umbrella to block in front of her, keeping the Spirit Burning Fire as far as possible from her body. At the same time, she gently touched her bangs in front of her forehead, her little face revealing a trace of sadness. Then, she turned her head and glanced in another direction, not too far off. Upon seeing Luo Zheng, she immediately exclaimed,</p>

  <p>"Wow, that was quick!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sauntered through the valley. Compared to the others who were trying their best to avoid the Rhyme Butterflies, he was much braver. Or, perhaps in the eyes of certain True Gods, he wasn't afraid of death at all.</p>

  <p>As he casually waved his hand, countless golden rays of light suddenly began shooting outward. The golden rays were created from the Metal Law of the Five Elements Divine Dao. As these golden rays of light gently flashed by his side, a large group of Rhyme Butterflies broke into tiny little pieces, and then flames erupted.</p>

  <p>The flames were extremely powerful, but Luo Zheng wasn't afraid in the least.</p>

  <p>Even if he was sucked into the flames, he wouldn't be burned. And what was more, what came toward him was nothing more than a hot flow.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Rhyme Butterflies were covered by the golden rays of light, they were crushed into pieces. Luo Zheng's extermination of Rhyme Butterflies was as efficient as a gust of wind sweeping fallen autumn leaves.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods thought that dealing with the Rhyme Butterflies was a piece of cake, but upon seeing Luo Zheng's killing technique, they all looked at him, eyes wide with astonishment.</p>

  <p>The only True Gods that even came close to Luo Zheng's speed throughout all the valley were the few top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>These top-rank True Gods all had the ability to freely wander within any second-grade forbidden area. Rhyme Butterflies were only common ferocious monsters in a second-grade forbidden area, and thus, no one really paid much attention to them. The top-rank True Gods shuttled directly through the Rhyme Butterflies, and everywhere they went, a large group of Rhyme Butterflies were killed. They quickly fell to the ground in pieces before the flames rose up in the air moments after.</p>

  <p>The number of Rhyme Butterflies coming out from the valley's four entrances was astonishing. In the blink of an eye, there were tens of thousands of them floating out of the valley. But in the face of the True Gods' powerful strength, no matter how many Rhyme Butterflies came through, there was simply no use.</p>

  <p>Less than five minutes later, there were no more butterflies coming out from the four entrances.</p>

  <p>"We're done here," said Reginald.</p>

  <p>"That wasn't so hard after all," someone said triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"You're right! That was easy!" someone else shouted in agreement.</p>

  <p>"I've killed at least fifty thousand Rhyme Butterflies myself alone!"</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods felt relaxed. To them, killing Rhyme Butterflies was a piece of cake. They had passed the test with flying colors.</p>

  <p>Like ordinary people, True Gods were prone to having an inflated sense of self.</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish. This was only the first wave of attacks. It will be become more and more difficult later on," Reginald reminded them as he listened to the others.</p>

  <p>In addition to Reginald, there were several top-rank True Gods and a few other mid-rank True Gods who had previously explored the Time Sea Forbidden Land, and they wore cautious expressions on their faces. In fact, it was safe to say that none of them looked relaxed at all. One of them agreed, "He's right! The number of Rhyme Butterflies against us just now is three times larger than the number of Rhyme Butterflies I encountered last time."</p>

  <p>"Judging by the number of Rhyme Butterflies alone, we can only imagine that this time, the difficulty might be three times bigger,"</p>

  <p>Reginald said in a very serious tone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was listening and as he heard this, he frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>For safety escape reasons, the True Gods had to prepare two Star Doors every time, which meant passing through this valley was particularly difficult. If they weren't careful of their every step, they risked their lives.</p>

  <p>If, according to what Reginald had said, the difficulty was increased by three times, then he could only imagine what the other waves of attacks had in store for them.</p>

  <p>Once the first wave was over, they all took a short and well-needed break. As the valley began to tremble anew, the second wave of beasts could be seen pouring from the four entrances.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Everyone saw countless red scorpions, the size of the soles of their feet, gathering into red tides and surging, crawling in consistent waves forward and making absolutely terrifying sounds.</p>

  <p>"Poisonous Wolf Scorpions!" a scream pierced the air.</p>

  <p>"They are extremely poisonous!" someone warned.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! Watch your step! The tails of the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions can shoot poisonous needles."</p>

  <p>Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were famous poisonous creatures in the divine land. Every scorpion's tail had a fine poisonous needle, which was hidden within the empty space of its tail. When it came into contact with its opponent, scorpion exerted a strong pressure in its tail and shot a poison needle out.</p>

  <p>Stranger still, the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions' venom was very unique.</p>

  <p>After being stabbed by one of their needles, an ordinary divine citizen would only be paralyzed; however, a True God would explode at once.</p>

  <p>The venom would enter their elixir field at an extremely fast speed, and destroy the Godly Tile. After that, their entire inner world would be turned upside down, which would eventually cause the inner world to collapse and shatter.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors below the level of True Gods and divine citizens, because they didn't have Godly Tiles, the venom simply didn't cause them as much damage.</p>

  <p>There were True Gods in the divine land who cultivated the Poison Divine Dao, and they equally wanted to capture the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions in order to extract their venom. They had this desire because their venom would greatly improve their strength. Unfortunately, the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions' venom became useless once extracted from the scorpions' bodies.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods didn't want to provoke these red scorpions, so when they saw the large number of scorpions rushing toward them, many of the True Gods' faces immediately revealed a sense of hesitation.</p>

  <p>Although the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were low-level ferocious creatures and weren't very powerful, they would lose their lives if they came into contact with the venom. Who was willing to take the risk?</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. Dodging the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions' needles isn't difficult. Just be careful," Reginald said reassuringly.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>While the True Gods were still standing around hesitating, Luo Zheng had already made his move without faltering.</p>

  <p>As he pushed outward with his hands, a fan-shaped flame spread along the ground, about to advance to the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the scorpions were quite agile, leaping over the fan-shaped flame, and their tails were already raised high toward him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Black poisonous needles spurted out from the tails of thousands of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, all at the same time. It was a scary and overwhelming sight for everyone!</p>

  <p>The poisonous needles were extremely thin and hard to distinguish with the naked eye. Without a doubt, they were a threat to the True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Watch out, Tianxing!" cried Aleyna, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Luo Zheng snorted and floated upward, like a ghost.</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling! Cling! Cling! Cling!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, all the needles fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Luo Zheng shouted fiercely.</p>

  <p>With a quick flick of his finger, a thick bolt of lightning shot out from the tip.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The thick mysterious lightening continued cracking and turned into millions of flashes of light as thick as a thumb, tightly covering the large area.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng's surprise, the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions reacted very quickly, but he believed that they couldn't dodge the lightning, no matter how fast they were.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the ground was charred, and all the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions had been smashed to ashes by the striking lightning.</p>

  <p>When the True Gods noticed what had happened, they stared at the ground. Their fear of the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions' venom had vanished, now only replaced by greed.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, once these Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were killed, they could be transformed into divine might coins right there on the ground.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, Luo Zheng had killed thousands of Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, and thousands of divine might coins took their places on the ground beneath their feet.</p>

  <p>Even though the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions' venom was terrible, killing all these scorpions was now more than worthwhile, especially for so many divine might coins.</p>

  <p>When Reginald and the other top-rank True Gods saw these divine might coins though, their expressions only became grimmer.</p>
