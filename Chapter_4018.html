<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Most big-headed monsters were eliminated on the round tray, while three or four of them were still left wandering aimlessly in the distance.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw them, he immediately rushed over with the long spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>As soon as he approached the monsters, several silver spear lights emerged and all of them were instantly killed.</p>

  <p>After finishing the job, Zheng returned and glanced at the crowd indifferently.</p>

  <p>Then, he suddenly tilted his head and opened his mouth.</p>

  <p>From Zheng's eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, the Treacherous Being's body continuously flowed out until it formed a shape of a human.</p>

  <p>Previously, they saw him as an abstract human figure with an extremely odd face.</p>

  <p>However, when he went out of Zheng's body, his form became complete.</p>

  <p>Every detail on the body was outlined, and he actually possessed a good-looking face. He looked exactly the same as the bronze statue beside the pool.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng's eyes opened, and the glisten in his eyes had finally returned.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! You're finally back!"</p>

  <p>"Are you okay now?"</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness!"</p>

  <p>After killing all of the monsters, they had been thinking about how they could communicate with the Treacherous Being to make him leave Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, he left on his own volition.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry guys. I'm fine now. This is Master Campbell, and he's actually a member of our race, so he has no intention of hurting me," Zheng explained with a smile.</p>

  <p>"His name is Campbell?" the Snake Goddess asked as she raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Then where did he come from?" Fuxi asked too.</p>

  <p>"And why did he possess your body? Squeak!" King Ieuan inquired its own question.</p>

  <p>Indeed, there were a lot of questions that needed to be answered. Even Zheng didn't know all of them, and he desired the answers directly from Campbell himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng just smiled at his companions and turned towards Campbell. A chorus immediately came from his inner world and translated the words. "Master Campbell, I actually have a lot of questions. Would you care to answer them?"</p>

  <p>Campbell just glanced at Zheng with indifferent eyes and waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"What do you still need? I've already returned your body. You can leave now."</p>

  <p>After saying that, he softly pointed a finger at Zheng. Then, the armor attached to Zheng's body was peeled off, and the long spear was also pulled from his hand.</p>

  <p>Campbell had completely awakened and regained his consciousness. He had been trying for countless of years, and he finally succeeded with the help of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Two hundred Treacherous Beings that were trapped on the Whining Road had been tirelessly achieving this goal. They would possess the passers-by on the road, and their final goal was to come to this place, no matter what the cost.</p>

  <p>Among the rest, he was the first one to succeed in regaining his consciousness and not be eaten by the big-headed monsters. But even though he was overjoyed, he didn't quite reveal his emotions.</p>

  <p>He didn't say that he didn't want to answer Zheng's questions, so Zheng still asked him anyway. "Master Campbell, are you from the Human Spirit Sect?</p>

  <p>We, humans, are what you may call the continuation of the human spirits. If there is anything we can do to help you, you can tell us without reservations. Don't give us the cold shoulder," Zheng said patiently.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't typically the one who wanted to force an answer from others.</p>

  <p>However, this situation wasn't an ordinary one. It wasn't easy meeting a human spirit, so he couldn't just let an important opportunity like this slip by.</p>

  <p>Campbell was still looking at Zheng nonchalantly. "Your physical body has been sufficient. It helped me contact the Light of Annihilation and kill those Treacherous Beings. Ultimately, it helped me completely wake up. But it's still not enough…" He shook his head as he continued speaking, "Well, it has nothing do with you now, so you don't have to involve yourself with me."</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation that he mentioned was the silver energy that was attached to the armor and the long spear.</p>

  <p>It could greatly restrain the Treacherous Beings, so Campbell couldn't have direct contact with it. That was why he needed a physical body where he could attach himself.</p>

  <p>His instinct told him that he should look for and choose a strong physical body.</p>

  <p>Now that he was fully awakened, Zheng's body wouldn't suffice anymore.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Zheng, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others who were from the secondary world and at the Eternal Realm were not qualified enough to get involved with his matters, given their current strength and innate limitations.</p>

  <p>"Well, I still did help you wake up. And I'm not even asking for any reward.</p>

  <p>I just want some information," Zheng insisted and pushed his luck.</p>

  <p>Although Campbell was quite arrogant, he was still grateful to have returned to his original form. So, he shrugged his shoulders and sighed,</p>

  <p>"Sure, go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Then, is this the Jade Pure Realm?" Zheng asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"The Jade Pure Realm, huh? Technically, you can say that. But this is just like the outer layer. There are several Pure Sky Platforms like this in the entire Jade Pure Realm. If you're really looking for the real Jade Pure Realm, go to the Pure Sky Platform in that direction." Campbell pointed his finger to the distance.</p>

  <p>"It's a hundred times larger than this one. That must be what you're after," he continued.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the direction that Campbell pointed to. There was a dense mass of starlight in the area, preventing him from seeing anything clearly.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had a similar guess to what Campbell had said. She thought earlier that the Pure Sky Platform that they were currently on was a branch of the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"Another one, are you from the Instant Civilization?" Zheng took the opportunity and asked again.</p>

  <p>"Instant Civilization?" It was actually Campbell's first time hearing this term, so it was a bit difficult for him to answer.</p>

  <p>"It's the name given to the first civilization that existed in the chaos. In short, it should be the civilization that built the chaos." Zheng tried to explain in the easiest way to understand.</p>

  <p>Campbell quickly understood what he meant. There was a faint smile on his face as he said, "Going by what you said, then yes, I'm from the Instant Civilization. The chaos that you're talking about was built by us."</p>

  <p>"So it's true?"</p>

  <p>Although Zheng already had a hunch, he was still surprised when he heard it directly from Campbell's mouth.</p>

  <p>"That's right." There was a bit of a frown that appeared on Campbell's face.</p>

  <p>"This particular secondary world was built with our greatest efforts, and it was also the last one that we built."</p>

  <p>Zheng was relieved that he had asked the right question. Now, Campbell was starting to tell more about his background.</p>

  <p>The two hundred Treacherous Beings were called the "builders" in the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>They were the ones who built all of the secondary worlds one after another.</p>

  <p>After building the chaos, they planned and decided to restart it, so that it could operate on its own.</p>

  <p>However, just a day before the plan to restart it, a deadly invisible poison floated out and spread from the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>They had never thought that they would be caught with the internal strife of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>It was too late when they noticed the poison, and they were all instantly killed.</p>

  <p>After the creatures of the main world died in a secondary world, they turned into Treacherous Beings that would never die.</p>

  <p>They took the form of spiritual orbs that wandered aimlessly, using their remaining consciousness.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they still possessed strong wills in their hearts. Once they achieved and completed their goals, their chance to return and wake up would be attained.</p>

  <p>The two hundred builders of the Human Spirit Sect lived in this Pure Sky Platform. While they were trapped in the Whining Road, they strove and struggled to return to this place. When they successfully did that, it was the time that they would completely awaken and regain their consciousness.</p>

  <p>After regaining their consciousness, the first thing they wanted to do was investigate what happened in the past.</p>

  <p>How were they killed in an instant?</p>

  <p>And who was really behind it?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, as soon as they regained their consciousness, they were devoured by the big-headed monsters before they could even leave the place.</p>

  <p>Soon after, they would come back to life on the Whining Road in the form of Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>The miserable cycle went on, until Campbell was the first one to succeed.</p>
