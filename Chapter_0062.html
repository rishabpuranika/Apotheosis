<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 62 Using The Flying Knife (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>As long as he penetrated the flesh and the second heart of the ogre, he could knock it down. And this was the only plan for Luo Luo Zheng to escape with his life.</p>

  <p>While he was still thinking about the solution, a strong wind blew from one side. Luo Luo Zheng glanced sideways only to find that the big palm of the ogre was coming toward him.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my god! No time to run away!'</p>

  <p>This time, even though Luo Luo Zheng wanted to dodge the attack, he did not have enough time to do so.</p>

  <p>There was no other alternative except to fight. Luo Luo Zheng made his decision quickly. He gritted his teeth, turned around, and then jumped on the back of the ogre's hand. Running along the back of its hand to its arm, Luo Luo Zheng then jumped on to the ogre's shoulder. With a somersault, Luo Luo Zheng crossed over the ogre's head. At this moment, his nose was only inches away from the two sharp horns on the ogre's head.</p>

  <p>With these calculated movements, Luo Luo Zheng had finally reached the ogre's back. It was then that he could see the prominent protrusion on its back!</p>

  <p>'This is it! Taste my Purple Fist Strength! You devil!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng summoned all his strength and channeled it to his fist. Then he hit the protrusion. This protrusion was the second heart of the devil! A purple light flowed out of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>If he could manage to inject the Purple Fist Strength through the thin layer of the ogre's flesh, its heart would be smashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, Luo Zheng's fist slipped when his attack landed on the ogre's back. Its skin was so slippery!</p>

  <p>'Oh, my god. I failed!' Luo Luo Zheng thought as an overwhelming feeling of danger flowed through him.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, the clumsy ogre sensed where Luo Luo Zheng was and slapped him when he turned around. 'Bang!' A loud sound echoed.</p>

  <p>The ogre had managed to land a blow on Luo Luo Zheng while he was on its back!</p>

  <p>Its power pushed Luo Luo Zheng far away. Seeing Luo Luo Zheng flying dozens of feet away because of the impact, like a small stone, the instructors sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"What a pity! He has almost done it! What a good opportunity was lost just now!"</p>

  <p>"The skin of the ogre is too tough to be broken by a little fellow who is just at the organ refining level."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so. However, it is a pity that he does not have a spiritual weapon in hand. Otherwise, he would have beaten the ogre."</p>

  <p>All the instructors watching the Picture Slabs could not help but sigh deeply. Anyway, in all the time that the ogre had been in the test, Luo Luo Zheng was the only candidate to pose a threat to the ogre. In retrospect, were these instructors really expecting this man at the organ refining level to defeat a grade-five unreal beast? Their expectation seemed a bit unrealistic. This incident drew some of their attentions back to reality.</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait. Don't run away!" Suddenly, one of the instructors shouted.</p>

  <p>Initially, these instructors could not see Luo Luo Zheng in their Picture Slabs. They could only observe him through other disciples' cards. Before the ogre beat Luo Luo Zheng, there were a few disciples bold enough to follow them and watch their battle. Once they saw that the ogre had defeated Luo Luo Zheng, these disciples turned and immediately ran away. They did not have the courage or the strength to face the ogre.</p>

  <p>As soon as they had run away, the instructors could no longer see Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, most of instructors knew that there was no need to see the fight to its end. Luo Luo Zheng would be eliminated eventually.</p>

  <p>Only Master Su kept looking at her Picture Slab. Several emotions passed through her as she watched the scene. She had tampered with Luo Zheng's disciple card earlier. And now, only she could see Luo Zheng's every move in her Picture Slab. As far as she was concerned, Luo Zheng's physical strength was indeed extreme. Even though the ogre had slapped him, Luo Luo Zheng did not look as bad as other instructors thought.</p>

  <p>'This fellow has not given up till now. He has a strong will. Powerful and determined, Luo Luo Zheng is more than a match for most disciples, ' thought Master Su. 'I hope this young man passes the test.' With this hope in mind, Master Su turned her eyes back to the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still lying on the ground. His chest heaved as Luo Luo Zheng took deep breaths to calm himself.</p>

  <p>The power of that slap was so terrible that he felt like all his bones had been smashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his body was strong enough to withstand the blow.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body had absorbed most of the ogre's power, and at the same time, it had transformed the force into warm currents that were refreshing his body.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a small portion of the power left, which was enough to cause serious injury to Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>With no strength left to move, Luo Luo Zheng could only lie on the ground and wait for the warm currents to restore his body. Meanwhile, he closely watched the ogre. Feeling the trembling of the ground, he knew that the ogre was getting close to him.</p>

  <p>Even though agonizing pain coursed through Luo Zheng's body with even a smallest movement, he did not want to give up yet.</p>

  <p>As long as there was a small chance, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to fight back.</p>

  <p>When the ogre saw his prey lying on the ground, it slowed down. The ogre even stopped and studied Luo Luo Zheng for some time. Then he raised his foot and was about to step on Luo Luo Zheng with the intention of trampling him to death.</p>

  <p>Maybe because the ogre felt that its prey was unable to move, it raised its foot slowly.</p>

  <p>The slow movement gave Luo Luo Zheng the time he needed to roll away. Enduring the agonizing pain, he climbed up from the ground. Luo Luo Zheng intended to jump up at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Ouch! That hurts!"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was determined not to wait for his death at the hands of the ogre, the movements caused a tremendous amount of pain to flow through him. He could not help but cry out in agony. The pain from the inner bones was so significant that his body lost flexibility and he could not jump up as he had planned to.</p>

  <p>In this case......</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng needed a new plan. Without hesitating, he took out the broken flying knife from his space ring and then summoned all his strength before throwing the flying knife at the ogre.</p>

  <p>'I hope it works!' Luo Luo Zheng prayed in his heart. This was his last hope. If this strike did not cause any harm to the ogre, then Luo Luo Zheng was doomed to be eliminated from the Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng watched the flying knife with bated breath. He was shocked when he saw the route of the flying knife.</p>
