<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>To admit such a thing in public made Margaret's cheeks instantly blush.</p>

  <p>The expression on the faces of the elders of Cloud Hall grew even weirder as they all turned to look at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Jacob and the rest were stunned. If Margaret was indeed telling the truth, then she would no longer have any value to Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Margaret Xi, in the Xi Clan's castle, you acted as if you were a holy virgin. I didn't expect that you had already fooled around with some loser." Since Margaret was no longer a virgin, Jacob's plan was naturally foiled. He felt extremely resentful. For the longest time he had boasted that he would not lose to any man, but this woman did not even bother to look at him!</p>

  <p>"He's not some loser!" Margaret replied defensively as she stared at Jacob.</p>

  <p>"Then who is he?"</p>

  <p>Yudie asked, curiosity getting the best of her.</p>

  <p>Actually, this had nothing to do with her, and only had something to do with the Xi Clan and Ethereal Spirit Sect. So when Yudie decided to chime in and ask specifics, it made her look like a gossip.</p>

  <p>However, Saint Morphens and the other elders of the Cloud Hall had already guessed that the man Margaret was talking about was most likely to be Zheng, and that was the main reason why Yudie suddenly became so concerned about the topic.</p>

  <p>But as for the Ethereal Spirit Sect's elders, they were still very confused as to what was happening. They looked at Yudie with strange expressions on their faces and thought, 'Why is this woman prying into something that doesn't involve her?'</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng suddenly said openly, "It's me."</p>

  <p>The moment he said that, the entire meeting room suddenly became silent. "Margaret is already my woman," he continued. "And because of that, I can't let you take her to Eddie."</p>

  <p>Zheng was not trying to hide the fact that it was him who took Margaret's virginity, but he was embarrassed to admit it in front of Yudie. However, since things had come to this point, he couldn't deny it any longer and he had to shoulder the consequences of what he had done to Margaret.</p>

  <p>When Yudie heard Zheng confess, she couldn't help but cast her eyes down, avoiding eye contact with him. Just last night, she was on the edge of spiraling into madness. Her face was already deathly pale then, but now, her face was completely devoid of color, as pale as death.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I think it's better if we adjourn this meeting. We still don't have a good way to save your sect leader, and I don't think we'll have one if we continue," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Jacob gritted his teeth as he glared fiercely at Zheng. As much as he wanted to, he could not take Margaret away forcefully, as he was on someone else's territory. The leader of Cloud Hall was here, and Zheng's strength was also unfathomable. Taking Margaret away against Zheng's will was simply a death wish.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in this situation, even if he could take Margaret away, it wouldn't mean much as apparently, she was not a virgin anymore.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Ethereal Spirit Sect didn't linger for too long and quickly left.</p>

  <p>After they left, the meeting hall immediately became silent.</p>

  <p>Margaret lowered her head and slowly leaned against Zheng. To her, he was her only source of strength and support.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, looked at Yudie and asked with concern, "Are you not feeling well?"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing," Yudie replied coldly. Turning around to address the elders of Cloud Hall, she tried her hardest not to have any eye contact with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Elders, do you have any other matters or concerns to go over today?"</p>

  <p>The group of elders was secretly scrutinizing Yudie's expression. Each and every one of them clearly knew that if anyone wanted to say anything at that moment, they would only be asking for trouble, so they simply didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall had already received the news of the war that had been started by the Heavenly Evil Sect. They should have discussed that situation with each other. There were simply too many things that needed to be talked about and decided on, but this was not the right time to discuss anything with Yudie.</p>

  <p>"If there's nothing else, we can discuss things another day." After Yudie said that, she quickly left the meeting hall without looking back, as if she had forgotten the existences of Zheng and Margaret.</p>

  <p>The elders looked at each other before following her out of the meeting hall.</p>

  <p>As those events unfolded, Margaret sensed that there was something wrong. She carefully asked Zheng, "Zheng, your sect leader's expression was so gloomy. What happened to her?"</p>

  <p>But then Zheng's expression was gloomy as well. How was he going to explain what had happened to her? After taking a deep breath, Zheng indifferently gazed at Margaret. Suddenly, he stretched out his hand to touch her black hair that was draped over one side of her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Margaret sighed and once again snuggled up to him meekly like a little cat, allowing Zheng to stroke her hair. Despite his words, she still felt that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Zheng never relaxed ever since he returned to Cloud Hall. For him, being back was an opportunity he needed to seize to further cultivate.</p>

  <p>He had always felt that time was running out for him. It was almost certain that there would be a fight between him and Eddie, and by the looks of how the Heavenly Evil Sect was developing, it seemed that its next step was to deal with Cloud Hall or the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>For the Heavenly Evil Sect, only Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance in the entire Central Region would be able to stop them from developing. After wiping out those two great sects, the Heavenly Evil Sect wouldn't have to worry about other sects like Mysterious Luna Hall, Bloodwood Cliff, or Black Mountain Sect.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't the only one who felt a sense of urgency, as the whole Cloud Hall felt an atmosphere of tension. The Ethereal Spirit Sect had already been wiped out. Warriors of Cloud Hall felt that they needed to get ready, as anything could happen at any time. Not many disciples accepted the missions distributed by Cloud Hall during this period of time, and the vast majority of them started to cultivate more intensely behind closed doors in order to break through their bottlenecks.</p>

  <p>They were doing this in order to at least have something to protect themselves with once the Heavenly Evil Sect officially launched a war against Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>But other than this tense atmosphere, there was also a strange atmosphere that was permeating within Cloud Hall. Of course, only the elders could feel this.</p>

  <p>Yudie's temperament suddenly became erratic and strange. As long as Zheng was around, she would either not say a word or immediately turn around and leave. She seemed to commit herself to completely ignoring him, and the relationship between the two of them seemed to have dropped to a level worse than being strangers to each other.</p>

  <p>Many elders were discussing this matter behind the backs of the people concerned.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has made such a great contribution to Cloud Hall. By now, he has already stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm and is unfathomably powerful. He will be an indispensable weapon for Cloud Hall when the Heavenly Evil Sect finally decides to attack. Because of that, the sect leader shouldn't be treating him like this."</p>

  <p>"Alas! The leader is still too young. She can't act based on her emotions.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, when Zheng returned, he should have been conferred the position of an elder! His contributions have been more than enough!"</p>

  <p>"Young people can never escape from love. The leader loves Zheng so much, and she must be feeling very sad right now. You know what? Now that I've thought about it, it's extremely normal for a man to have several women. As an appointed leader, she can't deal with this matter in the way she's dealing with it now!"</p>

  <p>"Right!"</p>

  <p>While the few elders were discussing the matter in private, Yudie floated out from the corner like a ghost. Her complexion was as pale as a corpse, and her cold eyes were fixed on the elders as she asked, "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>The elders were shaken up. They didn't expect her to be there! "No-nothing," they just muttered in unison, avoiding her gaze.</p>

  <p>Yudie slowly blinked her eyes. As days passed, she looked more and more ghostly, and it was obvious that she had lost a lot of weight.</p>

  <p>Without the energy to spare to argue, she just drifted away quietly.</p>

  <p>After she had left, the elders stroked their chests, sighed, and said, "This won't do. Let's find Morphens and have him talk to her! She needs some sense drilled into her!"</p>

  <p>In comparison, Margaret was thriving and her days seemed to get better and better every day.</p>

  <p>Although she couldn't help but feel sad when she thought of the things that happened in Ethereal City, in the end, she still found her home here.</p>

  <p>Even though she knew in her heart that Zheng might not be that fond of her, she still treated him as her husband.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Margaret was now like a completely different person.</p>

  <p>She wasn't thinking of things that would make her feel bad, and she even started going to Cloud Hall's market to purchase some rare ingredients.</p>

  <p>She would use Cloud Hall's kitchen to show off her exquisite culinary skills.</p>

  <p>Truly, Margaret might be arrogant, but she was born in a noble family.</p>

  <p>Other than cultivating, she was also extremely proficient at playing zither, arranging flowers, conducting tea ceremonies, painting, and especially cooking.</p>

  <p>In the past, she was the beloved daughter of the Xi Clan, and there were always many servants serving her. Now, she finally found a place to use her cooking skills. Every day, she would make exquisite dishes and wait for Zheng outside the cultivation room.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't cultivate for just one or two days. He would often go into closed-door training for five or six days without coming out.</p>

  <p>Margaret would eat some of the dishes that she had prepared, but the rest she still saved for him, until they eventually went bad. Even if she couldn't see him for several days, she didn't complain. She waited outside the cultivation room patiently, every day, with her delicious dishes.</p>

  <p>Those cultivation rooms were also being used by many disciples of the Cloud Hall. Everyone who came and went watched her wait.</p>

  <p>Besides the elders, all of the lower level warriors in the Cloud Hall had more or less known what she was doing here.</p>

  <p>They all knew that Margaret was waiting for Zheng every day.</p>
