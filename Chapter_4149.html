  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not restrain the ancestry-level bloodline, and as a result, it turned into a blood mist and evaporated in the air in the primitive land.</p>

  <p>In turn, the primitive land began to tremble again, and blood waterfalls flowed out from the blood mist on the dome.</p>

  <p>When the blood waterfalls had flowed down to the bottom, they condensed and formed blood pillars.</p>

  <p>There were a total of three hundred and seventy-three blood pillars, and each of them had a corresponding type of blood power of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Bright blood light suddenly appeared within the blood pillars, and then turned into long arrows that flew towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he did not dodge and allowed the arrows to hit him.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>As soon as the first blood arrow struck him, he felt something appear in his mind, and it turned out to be the blood power.</p>

  <p>That blood power was an ability in the creation quadrant.</p>

  <p>Before he could even test it out, more blood-red arrows shot towards him.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff...</p>

  <p>Every time a blood-red arrow hit him, a specific kind of blood power appeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>More than thirty seconds had passed, and all the blood-red arrows had entered his body. Then, the full power of the ancestry-level bloodline started to appear in his mind.</p>

  <p>"The power of space..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, he stretched out his hand and pointed to the distance.</p>

  <p>Afterward, layers of square spaces appeared somewhere in the primitive land.</p>

  <p>The spaces were surprisingly stable and almost as good as the space Othniel had created with the truth power.</p>

  <p>"Destructive power! Explode!"</p>

  <p>Red flames filled the air as all the spaces exploded at the same time. The destructive power spread out, and fires engulfed the entire primitive land in the blazing heat.</p>

  <p>"Creation..."</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng spread out his hands in the air.</p>

  <p>When the energy in the creation quadrant fanned out, long swords appeared out of thin air from all directions.</p>

  <p>Naturally, none of the swords were ordinary weapons as they appeared out of nowhere. Thousands of them fell like rain and collided with each other, making crisp and pleasant sounds. Soon enough, they quickly piled up into a sword mountain.</p>

  <p>In general, the Chaos Ancient God, Judson, could create things out of thin air. Ziya could also do the same with the help of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, but the grade, quality and speed of the items they created were far inferior to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>"Life..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced down.</p>

  <p>The emerald life energy began to gather and turned into over a hundred light dots, which took shape into a human.</p>

  <p>Not long after, human figures walked out of the light dots.</p>

  <p>They looked exactly like Luo Zheng, and their physical strength and power were on par with the Eternal Realm warriors'.</p>

  <p>Although he could create many incarnations in the continent, they could not leave his inner world. However, these men who looked like him were genuine "people" who could be released to participate in the battle.</p>

  <p>"Pick up the swords!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Upon his command, all of the "Luo Zhengs" picked up the swords on the ground.</p>

  <p>With a slight shake of their wrists, they turned around and slashed towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>Over one hundred rays of immensely sharp silver sword radiance flew straight up to the sky and cut across the dome of the primitive land. After that, they stopped.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the ancestry-level bloodline's most basic ability still had such extraordinary power. At this, Luo Zheng looked extremely satisfied.</p>

  <p>In the Jade Pure Realm</p>

  <p>A group of grey beetles flew close to the ground with a faint, flapping sound.</p>

  <p>These beetles were quite agile, as they nearly dodged all the obstacles in front of them while they maintained a one-inch distance above the ground at high speed. If one did not look carefully, they could even go unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Then again, the Jade Pure Realm was a magical land, where there was never a shortage of magical Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>One variety of palm-sized traveling birds had extensive sighting ability.</p>

  <p>No matter how small or hidden something was, their eyes always discovered it.</p>

  <p>"Goo! Goo! Goo..."</p>

  <p>When the birds saw the group of grey beetles that hovered just above the ground, they immediately swooped down.</p>

  <p>While the grey beetles were not slow by any means, the birds were significantly faster.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the birds had swept the beetles away and popped them into their mouths.</p>

  <p>"These annoying birds..."</p>

  <p>It turned out that Dale had formed the grey beetles. If he had not encountered those troublesome birds, he could have smoothly returned in that form.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>At that point, dozens of the grey beetles' bodies turned golden, and then swooped towards the birds.</p>

  <p>Usually, Dale was not afraid of these birds.</p>

  <p>However, his master, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, had told him that he could not return to his original form in the Jade Pure Realm at any time, or else the Snake Spirit King could catch him.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he could only use limited methods in his current form.</p>

  <p>Now, he had no choice but to let the grey beetles explode.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang, Bang...</p>

  <p>The golden beetles exploded as soon as the birds put them inside their mouths, and detonated the birds' heads in the process.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death..." Dale whispered.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, he suddenly heard more bird sounds. He looked up, only to be stunned.</p>

  <p>The explosion just now attracted more birds, and tens of thousands of them rushed downward!</p>

  <p>Only one beetle remained in the group. If the birds pecked that one last beetle, Dale would die in this place.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he got to change at the last moment. He quickly turned into a pangolin, stabbed the ground hard, and narrowly avoided such a disaster!</p>

  <p>It was much safer to sneak around in the form of a pangolin, but his speed got considerably reduced. It took him several days to find the bubble.</p>

  <p>Eventually, he found the bubble, entered it and transformed into his own form. After that, he called out tiredly, "Old man..."</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord appeared by his side and pointed at the entrance of the bubble. Then, the entrance quickly vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>As Dale watched the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's swift movement, he suddenly seemed to have realized something. "Old man, is someone following me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded and solemnly said, "There is a trace of an aura that doesn't belong to you. I'm afraid someone has targeted you..."</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! I've never transformed into a human form," said Dale.</p>

  <p>Even if one used their spiritual sense to check the Other Shore creature he had formed, they could not tell if the creature was real or not. He was quite confident in his bloodline ability.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the war between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect was in full swing, so they could not possibly have the time to look for him.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord didn't say anything. He just controlled the bubble to move deeper into the ground.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, others had discovered the bubble about two times, but it could freely move as it was not a fixed cave. When it got caught, it naturally hid in a more secluded place. Still, the Snake Spirit King thought that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was insignificant, just like a rat that hid underground.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Snake Spirit King was ready to kill everyone. Both the Bird Spirit King and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, who hid underground, had to be wiped out. Of course, they would receive even worse treatment than before.</p>
