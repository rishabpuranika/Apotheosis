<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the Monkey Spirit King stepped into the central lake, the water reached until his waist. With each step he took, a huge wave would ripple out.</p>

  <p>As the Monkey Spirit King got closer and closer to the edge of the passageway, Sewell and the Eye Spirit grew more and more cautious.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters cried out crazily and rushed towards them desperately.</p>

  <p>Killing a Treacherous Being was a bit complicated. The simplest way was to throw them into the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>This tactic was proving effective for the Monkey Masters, as three or four of their kind had already been devoured by the Void Dust. Desperately, they changed their strategy and attempted to approach the Monkey Spirit King from a low altitude.</p>

  <p>At least this way, even if they were knocked out by the Monkey Spirit King, they'd land in the lake and not the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Another three Monkey Masters closed in on the Monkey Spirit King's side.</p>

  <p>However, the Monkey Spirit King twisted his body slightly and slapped at them.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>The three Monkey Masters smashed into the water violently. The impact was so strong that the water shot into the sky as high as ten thousand feet.</p>

  <p>As the Monkey Spirit King was steadying himself, Manual grabbed this opportunity and swooped in. Finally, he was able to land on his shoulder, face to face with Sewell.</p>

  <p>"I guess you won't be able to leave," Manuel said coldly, as intricate golden patterns began to appear on his skin.</p>

  <p>Then, in a flash, a tremendous amount of force was released from his body and shot towards Sewell.</p>

  <p>"Annoying!"</p>

  <p>Sewell's eyes narrowed, filled with killing intent. He nimbly dodged the blow, suddenly becoming incredibly fast.</p>

  <p>Just as Manuel rushed over to strike once more, Sewell pounced onto him with great agility. In a flash, Sewell had managed to wrap himself around Manuel's body, gradually tightening his grip.</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters were all good killers. Any living being trapped in their grasp were bound to die.</p>

  <p>But now, Sewell was intertwined with the most powerful Great Ape King.</p>

  <p>Manuel looked at Sewell with condescending, pitiful eyes. "Really?</p>

  <p>You're going to try to kill me this way? Don't even think about it!"</p>

  <p>Sewell laughed sarcastically. "If I don't show you my strength, you'll never realize just how obsolete you are in this era. I'll kill you now, but next time, I'll erase your coordinates!"</p>

  <p>The second he finished speaking, Sewell released bone spikes from his body.</p>

  <p>These bone spikes had been deeply buried in his body. They were hollow and contained Holy Stones within them, which would ensure Sewell's safety when he used them.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The bone spikes quickly embedded themselves into Manuel's body.</p>

  <p>Once secured, the bones shattered automatically, revealing the Holy Stones within.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>All the Holy Stones released the Light of Annihilation simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation was fatal to any Treacherous Being. However, the stronger the Treacherous Being, the bigger the resistance to the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation was strong enough to directly kill hostility-level Treacherous Beings. The resentment-level Treacherous Beings had the ability to resist a blow, but they would be severely injured and irreparably damaged.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, hatred-level Treacherous Beings could completely withstand the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Manuel was stronger than hatred-level Treacherous Beings. Even if he was enveloped by the Light of Annihilation, he could come out of it unscathed.</p>

  <p>Sewell, however, was extremely confident in the Holy Stones.</p>

  <p>They were from the top of the four pillars, which meant they were of the highest grade.</p>

  <p>When the Holy Stones exploded simultaneously to release massive amounts of Light of Annihilation, Manuel's body began to tremble violently as though he had been electrocuted.</p>

  <p>His body, which he could normally manipulate freely, quickly hardened.</p>

  <p>Hairline cracks appeared on its surface, crawling all over his body until countless white fragments flaked off.</p>

  <p>With his body in this state, Manuel couldn't withstand Sewell's power.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Manuel's body began to collapse.</p>

  <p>But by now, Sewell had already retreated.</p>

  <p>With the dozens of Holy Stones releasing Light of Annihilation, even Sewell himself couldn't stand it.</p>

  <p>Sewell and Manuel had been fighting on the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King. Thus, when the Holy Stones exploded with Light of Annihilation, even the Monkey Spirit King was affected. Immediately, countless cracks appeared on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Take back those Holy Stones!"</p>

  <p>Sewell ordered the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>He was afraid of the Light of Annihilation, but the light had no effect on the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit sent over some eyeballs to retrieve the Holy Stones.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters who witnessed what happened were taken aback.</p>

  <p>Manuel and Sewell were at the same level. In terms of strength, Manuel was much stronger than Sewell, but now he was killed.</p>

  <p>Although they knew Manuel was going to revive from his coordinates, the Monkey Masters still felt hesitant to proceed.</p>

  <p>"Hey, losers!" Sewell spat. "If you have the guts, keep on fighting!"</p>

  <p>Casting them a cold glance, Sewell continued to guide the Monkey Spirit King towards the center of the lake.</p>

  <p>He had several cards up his sleeve which he knew were enough to deal with the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>But just then, a figure suddenly appeared in front of the chest of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>It was Fuxi.</p>

  <p>He raised his head, holding up a pair of black scissors in his hand.</p>

  <p>His eyes met with Sewell's, and he grinned wildly.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Sewell cried indignantly.</p>

  <p>How dare those humble humans take part in the battle of the Four Spirits Sect?</p>

  <p>They were courting death!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Sewell's mind was racing, but time was limited, so he only managed to spit out those three words.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Fuxi snipped off the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.</p>

  <p>The rope made of Three Resentments Poison fell towards the water, along with the wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>"Fuxi, you're courting death!"</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit suddenly floated up ominously, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p>

  <p>But Fuxi had retreated the second he snipped the cord.</p>

  <p>The Swift Bird's wings on his back could only be used once. Now they had lost their effect. Whether he would come out of this alive depended solely on his luck.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters, who had been watching nearby, were stunned.</p>

  <p>While they had noticed that the humans escaped from the Ghost Mountain, they had been preoccupied with the Eye Spirit and Sewell.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to them that these humans would help them save the Monkey Spirit King!</p>

  <p>With the Thirteen Teeth Necklace broken, there was a glimmer of hope!</p>

  <p>Sewell didn't have the time to chase after Fuxi. Instead, he quickly controlled the three colored rope to try to string the wolf teeth once more.</p>

  <p>Under his control, the three colored rope was like a nimble snake, chasing after the falling wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>The wolf teeth had only fallen a thousand feet before they were easily caught and strung up by the three colored rope.</p>

  <p>Everyone, from Fuxi, who had managed to retreat, to Luo Zheng and the Monkey Masters, felt despair when they saw this scene.</p>

  <p>The flicker of hope that they had just sparked was instantly extinguished.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held his breath as he watched the two ends of the rope were about to form a complete, closed loop.</p>

  <p>However, the Monkey Spirit King's right hand suddenly reached up.</p>

  <p>Grabbing the Thirteen Teeth Necklace on his chest, the Monkey Spirit King ripped it off his neck fiercely.</p>

  <p>The Thirteen Teeth Necklace was destroyed!</p>

  <p>The three-colored rope that had drilled into the back of his head was also pulled out.</p>

  <p>After Fuxi cut the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, Sewell's control over the Monkey Spirit King immediately weakened.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King, who was in the dream, immediately grabbed this opportunity. Using all his spirit power, he fought back against Sewell's control over his body.</p>
