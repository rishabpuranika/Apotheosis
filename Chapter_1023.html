  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng clenched his fists tightly. Although he maintained a calm expression, he was abnormally excited.</p>

  <p>When he was still in the Cloud Sect, Luo Luo Zheng had already listed Eddie as someone he had to kill. Even if he managed to save Yan, he had to kill Eddie. Eddie had become such an obstacle to his cultivation, and the only way to remove that obstacle was to kill him.</p>

  <p>He had waited for so long, and finally, the day had come.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng moved quickly on his feet and stood on the edge of the city wall. As silently as an owl approaching its prey, he slowly floated towards the outside of the city wall. The more excited he was, the calmer his expression became.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng leave the city wall, Ning Yudie called out, "Luo Luo Zheng! Are you really willing to accept the challenge?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned back and smiled at her. "Don't worry!" he said reassuringly, a bright smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"But..." Ning Yudie furrowed her brows and was about to speak when Luo Luo Zheng suddenly said, "Don't worry, Tia. I will not die. I will come back safe and sound and marry you."</p>

  <p>His voice was not loud, but many warriors of Cloud Hall were able to hear what he said clearly. Saint Morphens and a few other elders who knew of their situation couldn't help but have a knowing smile on their faces. As for the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm who knew nothing, such as Tianming and Lewis, surprise colored their faces.</p>

  <p>Lewis' eyes were wide open as he nudged Tianming with his elbow. "Tianming, did you hear what I heard?" he asked in utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes were closed, fresh blood slowly seeping out of them. He had been using his Sword Eye to accumulate the power of the heavens over the past two days. Only by doing so would he be able to unleash the full might of his Sword Eye.</p>

  <p>"Is it strange?" he replied, a slight smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Of course! It is really strange!" Lewis replied in a hushed tone, evidently scandalized by how Tianming was treating the whole thing as if it was normal.</p>

  <p>Tianming chuckled and shook his head. Then, he explained, "It's not strange at all for Luo Luo Zheng to do something like this."</p>

  <p>As for Ning Yudie, the moment she heard what Luo Luo Zheng said in front of everyone, her face suddenly flushed red.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng already had his head turn towards where Eddie was. While his face was calm, his eyes were filled with determination. Using his life vitality, he said slowly and clearly, "Two years ago when I was still at the Illuminating Soul Realm, I warned you that you would only be spared if you let go of Yan.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, you didn't grab that opportunity. Now your chance is gone!"</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Luo Zheng slowly drew out his sword from his space ring, and it started emitting a faint light. With the impressive sword fully in his hand, he waved it gently, and suddenly, a sword hum was transmitted. The hum was very soft and pleasant to hear.</p>

  <p>"It's a top-grade sacred weapon!" Dillon suddenly shouted as his eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Where did Luo Luo Zheng get a top-grade sacred weapon?"</p>

  <p>"There is no top-grade sacred weapon in the Central Region, and no weapon refiner has ever forged one. Where did he get it from?"</p>

  <p>While most people would not recognize that Luo Zheng's sword was a top-grade sacred weapon, Dillon and the other mighty warriors could tell what it was right away. As Luo Luo Zheng had already accepted Eddie's challenge, an intense battle would undoubtedly take place. As the outcome of this fight would decide who would win and who would lose this war, Dillon decided that he had to keep everyone's morale up.</p>

  <p>One way was to tell everyone how they had an upper hand with Luo Zheng's top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Eddie burst out in laughter. "Luo Luo Zheng, I've always known that you got a smart mouth since we met two years ago. I didn't expect that even after all these years, you still haven't grown up and come into contact with reality.</p>

  <p>You are still so glib-tongued. I'll remind you, in case you forgot? in a fight between warriors, one does not need to rely on one's mouth. Rather, it is based on one's own strength!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at Eddie and took a deep breath. Faint glow of two different colors appeared on the surface of his body. They intertwined and enveloped his whole body, making it look like he had a special luster on him.</p>

  <p>"Hey, everyone, look! Two stars have appeared in the sky!"</p>

  <p>"It's daytime now. How can there be stars?"</p>

  <p>"Those two stars seem to be shining down on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>How is he able to borrow the power of the stars!"</p>

  <p>Obviously, stars wouldn't just disappear during daytime. Because of the intense light from the sun, their lights were temporarily outshone, and so they went out of sight. However, after Luo Luo Zheng activated the Stellar Body, the lights from the purple star and the orange star suddenly increased tenfold, becoming brighter than the sun which made them noticeable to everyone, even though the sun was still out. Their lights then shot towards Luo Luo Zheng, who was light-years away.</p>

  <p>After his Stellar Body was fully realized, Luo Luo Zheng said coldly, "You're right.</p>

  <p>Then let me show you my strength!"</p>

  <p>After Eddie noticed the glow on Luo Zheng's body, a look of surprise became evident on his face. He began to frown, but soon enough, it was replaced by a face full of caution. Indeed, Luo Zheng's cultivation method awed Eddie like no other. Since ancient times, stars had always been a mysterious existence to humans.</p>

  <p>Even if they suspended all their beliefs in order to visualize the power stars held, it would still be a difficult feat to achieve. Even a glimpse to what they were capable of doing was impossible to achieve. Who would blame humans though? with the distance stars had from them? How would they be able to imagine such a thing?</p>

  <p>But here was Luo Luo Zheng, able to absorb the power of the stars. 'How? What kind of cultivation method is this?' Eddie thought, beads of sweat appearing on his forehead.</p>

  <p>Eddie took out his Nameless Saber cautiously. Previously, it was considered as the best among all the low-grade sacred weapons in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>If he would fight anyone, he would undoubtedly use it.</p>

  <p>However, when one compared it to Luo Zheng's weapon, Eddie's looked incredibly shabby.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had a top-grade sacred weapon. In terms of value, since such a weapon didn't exist in the Central Region, no one knew just how many low-grade sacred weapons one would be able to exchange for it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng once again waved his sword, not saying another word. With a flash, the forceful energy within his body shot out as he turned into a beam of light and shot towards Eddie, who was a few miles away.</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm only saw two streaks of light.</p>

  <p>With their speed, it only took a fraction of a second for the two of them to collide. The two streaks then bounced off each other, as if they were magnets pulling each other together, then being torn apart again and again.</p>

  <p>Even if the visions of the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm were slightly better, they were still unable to see the movements of the battling warriors.</p>

  <p>They, however, were able to distinguish the difference between the two opposing forces.</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm from both sides, however, revealed nervous expressions. This battle was too important for the both of them.</p>

  <p>Owen's eyes were fixed at the action happening in the distance. His face was filled with excitement. Compared to the others, what he was feeling was more complicated. Luo Zheng's victory did not just mean that the morale of Oracle City would be greatly increased? his lover and Luo Zheng's sister shared the same fate!</p>

  <p>Even though Owen couldn't see the two of them because they were moving at an incredibly high speed, he still clenched his teeth, trying to distinguish Luo Luo Zheng from Eddie.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was filled with killing intent!</p>

  <p>He had been waiting for this battle for so many years. Because he came in with the sole goal of winning, he did not hold back every time he attacked.</p>

  <p>As he rushed towards Eddie at a high speed, he made sure that his sword was pointed towards Eddie's heart.</p>

  <p>"No Move!"</p>

  <p>His attack looked crooked as his target was Eddie's chest. There was nowhere else he wanted to stab Eddie but deep into his heart.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Eddie held the Nameless Saber horizontally. Luo Zheng's sword was a top-grade sacred weapon after all, and he was at a disadvantage. At the very least, he did not dare to use the Nameless Saber to block Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Eddie lightly touched Luo Zheng's long sword with his blade, and skillfully swung it away.</p>

  <p>However, just as Eddie deflected Luo Zheng's sword, Luo Luo Zheng said faintly, "That's going to be useless!"</p>

  <p>His sword tip drew a circle in the air, and it continued to stab at Eddie's chest like a shadow. The "No Move" didn't mean Luo Luo Zheng had no move. It was a move created by Luo Luo Zheng? he would only perform a single move, but it would manifest a countless number of moves.</p>

  <p>It was an unbreakable move!</p>

  <p>When Eddie saw that he could not avoid Luo Zheng's sword attack, his face changed dramatically, and he quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a strange smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he gently raised the sword in his hand. The sword attack that originally looked normal suddenly underwent a tremendous change!</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng tried to stab Eddie with his sword, it was followed by a sharp sword radiance, extending the tip of the sword. Because of that, it continued shooting towards Eddie's chest. As Luo Zheng's No Move combined with all the other basic sword moves, he had already reached the stage where he could use his sword as freely as he wanted.</p>

  <p>Eddie's expression changed once again, and his body became rigid. All of a sudden, he came to a halt. The sword radiance cut into his ribs, causing blood to spurt.</p>
