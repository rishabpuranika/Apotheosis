<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wouldn't have been difficult for King Manard to remove these remains with this place under his full control.</p>

  <p>But he left them here for the purpose of using them as Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>"But these remains don't have energy or Other Shore Power. They would have no complicated power," Zheng pointed out.</p>

  <p>There were two factors to determine an Other Shore Token's value.</p>

  <p>They were whether or not it had strong Other Shore Power, and whether or not it had a unique ability.</p>

  <p>The stronger the Other Shore Power was, the stronger its bearer would be.</p>

  <p>The power of Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type tended to not be as strong, but they often had unusual abilities. For example, the Heart of Accomplice was able to forcibly end the lives of both the user and another powerful warrior. No other token could do this.</p>

  <p>King Manard ambled forward, his hands behind his back. He gazed out into the void. "It's almost impossible for them to use the Other Shore Tokens to realize the Finale Way. The human race was trapped in this in the past."</p>

  <p>Neither Zheng nor No. 9527 could understand, but the eyes of the Regal Jade Spirit flashed.</p>

  <p>After all, the Regal Jade Civilization had once been a ruling force and had also confronted the needle in hopes to realize the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>"You mean it's impossible to realize the Finale Way by relying on the strength of the Other Shore?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked.</p>

  <p>King Manard shot the Regal Jade Spirit an unexpected admiring look.</p>

  <p>"Among so many civilizations, the human race came the closest. We very nearly achieved it."</p>

  <p>"You almost made it?" The Regal Jade Spirit's eyes flashed strangely. "Our Wing King had merged with the Invisible Spirit Herb from Stage Thirty Three. He used the Trial Lamp to reflect about a thousand more Invisible Spirit Herbs and extracted the Other Shore Power within them. After that, he increased the Other Shore Power by thirty times with the help of the Withering Power and combined it with the Spectral Thunder Shield, but he still failed. He almost made it, too."</p>

  <p>As the strongest warrior in the Regal Jade Civilization, the Wing King was chosen as the Finale Hero.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization had gathered all the Other Shore Tokens they had and released the most powerful forces they could muster to fight off the needle.</p>

  <p>The Invisible Spirit Herb was a kind of herb without a root that grew in the depths of Stage Thirty Three. It looked ordinary, but in fact, the Other Shore Power contained in it was stronger than that of any others!</p>

  <p>The Trial Lamp was also a rare Other Shore Token. It was a sixth-grade Other Shore Token in Stage Thirty Two. The shadow of the Invisible Spirit Herb that the Trial Lamp reflected was able to inherit half of the Other Shore Power of the Invisible Spirit Herb. If a thousand Invisible Spirit Herbs were reflected, their power would have increased to five hundred times!</p>

  <p>Zheng had used the Withering Power before. It was a Latent Theurgy passed down from the Nine Li race. But the power of the Latent Theurgy was naturally weaker than the Withering Power used by the Wing King and other strong cultivators.</p>

  <p>Five hundred was then multiplied by thirty. The exponentially increased Other Shore Power must have been overwhelming.</p>

  <p>This was the Finale Way of the Wing King.</p>

  <p>Zheng was astounded by the Regal Jade Spirit's story. He tried to imagine just how strong the Finale Way released by the Wing King was.</p>

  <p>However strong it was, that power was still unable to subdue the needle!</p>

  <p>The Wing King was the leader of the Regal Jade Civilization. Although the civilization had been destroyed, the Regal Jade Spirit was still very proud of him.</p>

  <p>The Finale Way of the Regal Jade Civilization must have been extremely powerful for the Wing King to get that far.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization had not been weak on the Other Shore. It was one of the top ten civilizations in the past.</p>

  <p>King Manard shook his head at the Regal Jade Spirit's words. "You must have been very good at collecting Other Shore Tokens, for you to have obtained the Trial Lamp and the Spectral Thunder Shield."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." The Regal Jade Spirit felt appeased that his civilization was recognized for its efforts, even if their king failed in the end.</p>

  <p>"It's not a compliment. You were still quite far from realizing the Finale Way. Merging with the Invisible Spirit Herb and increasing its strength by the Trial Lamp and the Withering Power was only one of our alternatives.</p>

  <p>The last Other Shore Token we used was not the Spectral Thunder Shield, but the Magic Shield with a stronger defensive capability.</p>

  <p>Back then, we chose ten persons to be the Finale Heroes. The one who adopted this plan similar to yours was only in eighth place among those who came close to success," added King Manard, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Only eighth place?!" The Regal Jade Spirit's eyes widened in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? That was the best solution chosen by the Wing King!</p>

  <p>Nothing else came close!"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit was greatly shocked.</p>

  <p>He had thought that the Finale Way of the Regal Jade Civilization had been close to success, but it turned out to be such a lowly solution.</p>

  <p>Unconvinced, he pressed, "What did the person in first place use, then?"</p>

  <p>"The first..." A trace of sadness appeared in King Manard's eyes. "He was our leader. He merged with the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone. The Trial Lamp couldn't reflect the Overdraft Stone, but he gave everything up, including his life. Just the combined power of the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone was much stronger than the power you obtained. The combined power was further increased by the Withering Power, and then...</p>

  <p>Alas, it was a pity we failed in the end. We were so close," King Manard said, regret written on his face.</p>

  <p>Perhaps feeling he had discouraged the Regal Jade Spirit too much, he added, "Actually, it was not your fault. After the human race almost completed the Finale Way, those hiding on the Other Shore grew scared.</p>

  <p>After that, they set the rules, and the Other Shore was designed by them in such a way that no civilization would ever complete the Finale Way. It became a pipe dream. I guess that after the 77th civilization was destroyed, the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone were both hidden away. They might have even destroyed them."</p>

  <p>No. 9527 nodded in agreement. "We haven't heard of these two tokens on the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>"By their rules, the Finale Way is destined to fail, and there is no possibility of success," King Manard said firmly. "So we can't rely on that Other Shore.</p>

  <p>We must create our own force!"</p>

  <p>He glanced at Zheng and continued, "The Other Shore Power is from outside of the chaos. We can also obtain it."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pointed at the debris on the ground. The broken statue of horse head returned to its original condition. But the new statue seemed a little different.</p>

  <p>"What do you see?" asked King Manard.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the statue and observed it carefully. After a short while, he actually felt a slight energy on the statue. It was the Other Shore Power!</p>
