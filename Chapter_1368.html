  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not expect himself to solve the mystery left behind by Supreme Lord Sword. That was giving way too much credit to his abilities.</p>

  <p>These white sword shadows had indeed proven useful in improving the strength of his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>However, they also gave Luo Luo Zheng extreme pain. Every time a white sword shadow passed through his body, his heart would suffer this intense, piercing pain.</p>

  <p>After being subject to the attack of thousands of white sword shadows, he was surprised that his heart was still intact since he felt as if it was going to explode.</p>

  <p>Still, he had been through worse. The piercing sensation in his heart was nothing compared to the excruciating pain he had experienced when he replaced his life energy with chaotic energy. There was no way he was going to back down just because of a little pain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng returned to the site of the huge rock but was surprised to see the two Spirit Supreme Realm warriors staring at him as he approached.</p>

  <p>These two originally sported benign faces but now looked as if they were about to murder him.</p>

  <p>"You, you? What did you do?" Landry asked with a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it? What have you done?. How did you make the feeling disappear?" Damian asked as well.</p>

  <p>Their eyes glazed over, making the two of them look like mad beasts who had been shaken out of their peaceful abodes.</p>

  <p>The two of them had spent tens of thousands of years meditating on this spot, dreaming that one day they would form some sort of magical connection with the words etched on the giant stone.</p>

  <p>The giant stone had been there long before the two of them. It had been subject to the weathering of the elements but still emitted a fierce Mu Ning that remained unchanged despite the passage of time.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly arrived and enacted such a strange change to this place. How could they remain calm?</p>

  <p>These two had spent their lives meditating, therefore, their physical strength was far inferior to other average Spirit Supreme Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Their minds had also lost all hunger for blood and had been conditioned for peace. However, this change made their emotions bubble up to the surface!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword was one that could battle with True Gods after all!</p>

  <p>The swordsmanship he left behind was powerful enough to defeat a deity, so long as one was able to comprehend it. The two Spirit Supreme Realm warriors had spent all this time and this effort trying to unlock the mysteries of this technique. Whatever they sought to gain, they understood that they would have to pay for. However, the sudden arrival of this newcomer had thrown everything off balance.</p>

  <p>"I didn't do anything!" Luo Luo Zheng quickly claimed.</p>

  <p>"Impossible! You better tell us the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think we were born yesterday? Who are you fooling?"</p>

  <p>The two of them had initially chosen to watch calmly on the side. They didn't really think Luo Luo Zheng would be able to comprehend anything nor make such a dramatic change to this place.</p>

  <p>However, the sudden disappearance of the piercing pain in their hearts changed everything. Their faces were now filled with malice?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was alarmed by their accusations but could definitely understand where they were coming from. These two had spent their entire lives here as if they were guarding a huge treasure trove for years.</p>

  <p>However, he had suddenly come and triggered some strange phenomena.</p>

  <p>He might not have solved the mystery left behind by Supreme Lord Sword, but he still did something.</p>

  <p>It would be strange for these two to not react this way.</p>

  <p>A fight didn't worry him. Luo Luo Zheng knew Yolande was nearby so starting a fight with him would be courting death for these two. Also, they were acting this way because of their heightened emotions but there was no trace of killing intent from any of them.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Luo Luo Zheng pitied them a bit?</p>

  <p>"I swear I didn't do anything. I just saw these weird sword shadows and broke a few into pieces. After that, it became like this," he explained.</p>

  <p>There was no need to hide anything since he had already mentioned this to Yolande and Layla.</p>

  <p>However, none of them believed him.</p>

  <p>"Sword shadows!"</p>

  <p>"What do these sword shadows look like?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tried to explain with his hands but at that moment, he felt the familiar piercing sensation in his heart. "The sword shadows seem to have appeared once again," he said with a wince.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him, the two Spirit Supreme Realm masters felt it too. It seemed the words on the giant rock had gone back to normal.</p>

  <p>"So all these years, that piercing pain in our hearts was caused by the sword shadows?"</p>

  <p>"Why can't I see them? Why can't I see them??" they muttered to themselves, feeling depressed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't really be bothered to answer but did wonder why these two men were so bothered by the sword shadows.</p>

  <p>It was as if they were so desperate to see these sword shadows as well.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a white sword shadow flew towards him. Luo Luo Zheng raised his Thunder Wind Divine Sword and his sword intent circled around the blade as he slashed towards the sword shadow seven times!</p>

  <p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh?</p>

  <p>The white sword shadow shattered after seven strikes, just as he expected.</p>

  <p>However, after shattering one sword shadow, the rest immediately flew towards him once again!</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng did not resist. He knew trying to run away from these sword shadows was futile so he might as well go all out and practice his sword intent!</p>

  <p>He held the sword straight in front of him and placed his other hand on the blade.</p>

  <p>The white sword shadows surged like a tidal wave but Luo Zheng's eyes held a deadly seriousness in them.</p>

  <p>With the approach of thousands of these faint lights, he let out a cry and struck out with his sword!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not release the Law Power within the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. He merely activated his sword intent as he wildly waved the sword in his hand while firmly standing his ground.</p>

  <p>From a mortal's perspective, they wouldn't see Luo Zheng's hand nor his sword.</p>

  <p>All they would be able to see were the fluttering shadows of his sleeve and the blue flashes of his sword.</p>

  <p>His movements were too swift and the scene would be too much for a normal person's eyes to bear.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Strong gales of wind rolled out from his sleeve as Luo Luo Zheng tried to fight off the constant tirade of white sword shadows. The Thunder Wind Divine Sword proved to be effective in repelling these sword shadows but they merely spun and shot back towards Luo Luo Zheng, causing the warrior to exert more effort in fighting them off.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, seven strikes were all it took to shatter these white sword shadows.</p>

  <p>As the sword shadows shattered into thousands of faint pieces, they all quickly rushed into his body and merged with his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>However, there were just too many of these white sword shadows and Luo Zheng's strength had already reached its limit.</p>

  <p>He was initially able to fight them off but quickly fell short of strength. It wasn't long before Luo Luo Zheng was submerged under a tidal wave of these sword shadows. Unfortunately, that meant he was once again subject to unbearable, piercing pain.</p>

  <p>'My heart? is going to explode!' he thought, his eyes rolling to the back of his head before fainting.</p>

  <p>Xun once again came out of his body as soon as he passed out. She turned to the two warriors in front of him and glared coldly at them. She took it as her responsibility to protect him during this period of vulnerability.</p>

  <p>Even if she was a mere soul, her current soul was already at the Silver Fighting Soul Realm which meant she could still face off against these two warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm. She vigilantly kept her guard up in case these two ever decided to attack.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, both Landry and Damian stared blankly at Luo Zheng's unconscious form.</p>

  <p>They were certain that Luo Luo Zheng had uncovered a few mysteries but neither of them could find out what.</p>

  <p>They were so desperate for answers, almost on the brink of losing their minds but they knew it wouldn't end well for them if they hurt a martial artist of the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>It hadn't been easy ever since the Willow Island became the thirteen palaces' territory to hold the Passing the Torch. The two of them had paid a large amount to bribe those in charge to let them stay in this spot.</p>

  <p>Laying a single hand on Luo Zheng's head would mean courting death, as all the powerful warriors of the thirteen palaces had now gathered in the Willow Island.</p>

  <p>Instead of harming him, perhaps they could work with him? When Luo Luo Zheng comprehended the mysteries of Supreme Lord Sword, maybe they could get a share of the mysteries as well?</p>

  <p>They were going nuts with all the thoughts that were going through their heads but they had to fight off the impulse of kidnapping Luo Luo Zheng and forcing him to spill his secrets?</p>

  <p>A moment later, however, Luo Luo Zheng finally came to.</p>

  <p>After that last round, his sword spirit had now become even more powerful! It was not impossible to block these white sword shadows and this fact fired Luo Luo Zheng up for the next fight.</p>

  <p>"I'll practice it again!" he roared, readily approaching the torrential wave of the white sword shadows. He slashed out seven times with his sword, the sword shadows were activated and came at him like a torrent once again, and he was once again submerged by them?</p>

  <p>He was able to hold on for a few seconds longer this time before fainting once again after his heart reached its breaking point.</p>

  <p>It was a cycle of fighting, being submerged by the white sword shadows, fainting from the pain, and waking up once again.</p>

  <p>Xun, his sword spirit, on the other hand, was continuously growing stronger at a visible rate. Luo Luo Zheng could also feel that his sword intent had changed once again.</p>
