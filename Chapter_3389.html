<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3389 Stench Of Blood </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Chaim stared right at Luo Zheng, unable to utter a single word.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng really did fly in the air, against the hurricane!</p>

  <p>The power of the hurricane was too strong, there was no way Luo Zheng could have survived even with the protection of the cave. Chaim knew that if the roles were reversed, he would have been swept away already.</p>

  <p>But from the looks of it, Luo Zheng didn't seem to be affected at all.</p>

  <p>Sally, on the other hand, was hardly surprised. All along, she believed that Luo Zheng flew against the hurricane. She didn't even bother thinking about how Luo Zheng did it; what mattered was that he was successful.</p>

  <p>After moments of wondering, Chaim decided it was best to just ask Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng... How in the world did you make it?"</p>

  <p>"I used an Other Shore Token," Luo Zheng replied frankly.</p>

  <p>"An Other Shore Token..."</p>

  <p>Chaim was in awe. What kind of Other Shore Token could be so powerful as to resist a full-blown hurricane like that?</p>

  <p>Even the sixth-grade Other Shore Tokens at Stage Thirteen of the Lust World still wouldn't be able to demonstrate such resilience.</p>

  <p>Though Chaim still had many questions, he chose not to ask anything more.</p>

  <p>Usually, Other Shore Realm warriors made sure to keep their Other Shore Tokens in secret. Although there were many people in the Source World who had classified the Other Shore Tokens, many Other Shore Tokens were still mysteries and unknown to people other than the holder. Once those Other Shore Tokens were used, they would have miraculous effects.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng," Sally asked as her eyes widened, "where are the two demon women?</p>

  <p>Were they blown away by the hurricane?"</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng shook his head, "I killed them."</p>

  <p>The casual tone in Luo Zheng's voice made Chaim's eyelids twitch ever so slightly.</p>

  <p>By the fact that Luo Zheng's strength was not inferior to that of the two demon women and he could fly unharmed in the hurricane, they probably had had nothing against him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Eventually, the hurricane gradually subsided and disappeared into the air.</p>

  <p>Chaim and Sally got out of the crack.</p>

  <p>They patted down the bodies of the several nonhuman creatures and checked their belongings. Afterwards, the treasures in their space rings were divided between the two.</p>

  <p>Sally had taken a large portion of the treasures. Though she had no personal interest in the weapons, she figured that her brothers might need them considering that their weapons were too common. Luo Zheng, being the all mighty and gracious, didn't take anything.</p>

  <p>Once all the treasures were settled, Luo Zheng took out the Chaotic Source Spirits and began to distribute them.</p>

  <p>Originally, he had planned to give a number of Chaotic Source Spirits to the several warriors of the other three races. Since they ended up dead, Luo Zheng was able to keep that part for himself.</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Zheng kept over 160 Chaotic Source Spirits himself, and gave seventy to Sally and Chaim respectively.</p>

  <p>"By the looks of it, even if we don't enter the core area of the Chaotic Source World, we can gather enough Chaotic Source Spirits!" Chaim pointed out.</p>

  <p>Only very few Chaotic Source Spirits can be found in the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Usually, smashing a mountain into pieces could generate only one or two Chaotic Source Spirits, much like Luo Zheng's first experience. He destroyed many rocks but only found one, and sometimes, he found nothing at all.</p>

  <p>They got lucky with the special cave. How the queen ant swallowed so many Chaotic Source Spirits was a mystery. However, they couldn't help but be grateful because it became easier for them to collect the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"This amount of Chaotic Source Spirits is still not enough," continued Chaim "We should still seek them out in the inner part of Chaotic Source World," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>With the help of the soul marks, he found that Feng Ge, Dorothy, and the members of the Nine Li race were sent far away due to the hurricane. But on the whole, they were all headed towards the center of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Both Dorothy and Feng Ge attempted to get closer to Luo Zheng, but the hurricane would arrive and take them away every 5 minutes. It was too difficult for any of them to approach Luo Zheng as it would purely depend on luck, so they eventually gave up.</p>

  <p>All they knew was that the hurricane whirled from the south to the north, so Luo Zheng, Sally and Chaim flew towards the western area.</p>

  <p>After the three of them flew in the air for about five minutes, Chaim looked at the black smog and said, "The hurricane is coming back soon."</p>

  <p>Though the hurricane came without any warning, it was always, always punctual.</p>

  <p>Among the three, Luo Zheng did not fear the hurricane. It was Chaim and Sally who had to secure a place to hide.</p>

  <p>Deep in thought, Luo Zheng scanned his surroundings and found nothing that could be of use. Without warning, he rushed down, jumped in the air, and began smashing into the ground.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Just like that, Luo Zheng had created a cave that was ten-foot deep into the ground.</p>

  <p>He'd been saving this plan for a time when he'd need it. Before, Luo Zheng would just go with the wind because he just entered the Chaotic Source World and was clueless with where to go. Now that they needed a place of protection, he felt that it was the best time to execute his plan.</p>

  <p>The trio hid safely in the cave for five minutes. After the hurricane had settled, they climbed out of the makeshift cave and continued to fly west.</p>

  <p>After becoming more familiar with the Chaotic Source World, the warriors realized that the chances of finding Chaotic Source Spirits in the periphery were too small. Because of this, a majority of them began to travel towards the core area.</p>

  <p>Some had traveled a long way, only to be blown further back by the relentless hurricane.</p>

  <p>But after experiencing this so many times, many of them were able to arrive at similar strategies. They would dig holes in the ground to avoid the hurricane, then once it stopped, they would continue their journey towards the center.</p>

  <p>To the three's luck, they found four caves already dug as they traveled. This saved them time and energy as they didn't even need to dig by themselves.</p>

  <p>All they had to do was get inside and hide.</p>

  <p>Less than an hour of travelling had passed and another low mountain appeared beneath Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, the entire mountain was scorched black, and there were sword marks slashed across its surface. Some parts were riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if a serious battle had happened here.</p>

  <p>"Let's go down and have a look," Luo Zheng suggested. He pointed at the mountain for Sally and Chaim to see.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng began to move closer towards the mountain, with Sally and Chaim right behind him.</p>

  <p>Due to the hurricane, traces of the battle were close to nonexistent. If anyone had died, their bodies would have been swept away and moved elsewhere.</p>

  <p>However, thanks to Luo Zheng's spiritual sense that scanned the area, he soon found a huge cave at the back of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The three flew to the back of the mountain. At the entrance of the cave, they began to cough and gag as the heavy stench of blood permeated the air.</p>

  <p>What they saw in the cave stunned each of them. dozens of bodies of nonhuman creatures were scattered across the ground.</p>

  <p>Their corpses were dismembered and incomplete.</p>

  <p>Chaim tried his best to absorb the horror before him. He looked over the scene, but something caused him to do a double take. He glanced at a body and gasped, "That's Guillermo!" he said, pointing at the body. "Guillermo from the Bright Mountain!"</p>

  <p>He rushed towards the edge of the cave where a corpse was embedded in a crack on the wall. Half of his body had been damaged by explosion, but his features were still recognizable.</p>

  <p>Because Chaim came from Bright Mountain, he knew Guillermo Wang very well, who was one of the best disciples. Seeing his tragic death had brought Chaim to tears.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who did this," he sighed. "It's too cruel." Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had something else in mind. He observed all the corpses and noticed something about them: All the corpses' space rings were missing.</p>

  <p>Whoever did this didn't only kill people, but also looted their belongings.</p>

  <p>Killing all these people took outstanding strength. But on the other hand, outstanding creatures who had the ability to do this were all arrogant and they despised such an act.</p>

  <p>With a motive to take space rings, this murder was out of Luo Zheng's comprehension. How could someone do this?</p>

  <p>The image of the Evil God appeared in Luo Zheng's mind. He might be the one responsible for this scene as Luo Zheng could think of no one else that had such a way of doing things.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued to think, he heard a gnawing groan close by.</p>

  <p>He rushed to the direction where the sound came from. Then he saw a huge body of someone from the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The bodies of Separate Abyss race were known to be extremely tough and resilient. To Luo Zheng's surprise, the warrior who groaned was severely injured, but he was still alive.</p>
