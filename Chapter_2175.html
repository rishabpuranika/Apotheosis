<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This year's participants in the Heavenly Han House's exam were far better in both numbers and quality than last year's. As such, Seth's results didn't surprise anyone.</p>

  <p>After Seth took the initiative, the other participants began to throw their White Jade Tokens one after another. The tokens all recorded their names and where they came from. When all the tokens were restricted by the force in the air, the order and the detailed information of each of the proving godly warriors would be recorded. The height of their throw would be then announced by one of the proctors.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the proving godly warriors were throwing their White Jade Tokens, all of them used their own methods to apply the power they had comprehended onto the tokens. That way, the White Jade Tokens could fly a bit higher and earn the warriors a place in the top rankings. It was the only way they could get a better chance for the examination.</p>

  <p>Some of the White Jade Tokens had strong flame energy attached to them. As the tokens flew upwards, a series of strange sounds rumbled throughout the place as each warrior attempted to push their White Jade Token even higher. There were also some White Jade Tokens that had a variety of different types of powers attached to them. Some of these powers came from various Divine Dao, while some merely came from the warriors' brute force to throw the tokens.</p>

  <p>These warriors could be called proving godly warriors, so more or less, they had already stepped into the Divine Dao. Their strength and abilities were already impressive. However, they didn't have a deep comprehension of the Divine Dao and were still unable to condense their Godly Tiles.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the White Jade Tokens could only climb up to a height of three hundred to four hundred feet. Moreover, only a few could reach a height of over four hundred feet. The elite warriors who could reach the results of near five hundred feet were already better than ninety percent of the proving godly warriors. A very small number of proving godly warriors could reach a height of over five hundred feet, and they were the elites among elites. The height of their tokens clearly reflected the talent of each warrior.</p>

  <p>For example, Eric threw his White Jade Token to a height of five hundred and forty feet. With a smug look on his face, he was already quite satisfied with his result.</p>

  <p>Over one hundred thousand proving godly warriors threw their White Jade Tokens at the same time. Countless different colored lines appeared in the sky above the Heavenly Han House. Most of the tokens had a unique burst of energy below it. It was truly spectacular!</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>A sharp sound pierced through the sky and attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>The White Jade Token was wrapped in a black flame. It was like a black meteor that quickly rushed upwards!</p>

  <p>That particular White Jade Token was thrown by Zane. Everyone's gaze was already gathered towards his token.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, Zane was only ranked fifth on the list, behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, everyone was surprised by Zane's black flame. With its help, his White Jade Token had instantly surpassed the height of Seth's six hundred and seventy feet!</p>

  <p>The higher the White Jade Token, the greater the resistance and the slower it would rise. As such, the difficulty of the task got exponentially harder as the altitude of the throw got higher.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the black flame still burned on the White Jade Token. Even though it had already surpassed Seth's record, Zane's token maintained its ascend. It was slow yet it still continued to climb. Finally, it stopped at a height of seven hundred and ninety feet!</p>

  <p>Zane's face was filled with a pleasant surprise at this sight. He didn't think that he would be able to surpass Seth by so much in a single go. A proud look painted his face.</p>

  <p>"Zane's White Jade Token actually reached seven hundred and ninety feet!"</p>

  <p>"The best result from all the years seems to be only at eight hundred and twenty feet, right?"</p>

  <p>"It seems like Zane's strength is really underestimated; he shouldn't be ranked fifth!"</p>

  <p>As he heard those comments, Zane felt very comfortable and his gaze landed on Luo Luo Zheng once more. He said in a clear voice, "The disciples of our Han Clan have always relied on our own abilities to enter the Heavenly Han House. It's very different from what some people think!"</p>

  <p>As Malloy Han heard this, he also nodded his head. The members of the branch families of Han Clan were indeed extraordinary. Each of them was able to properly enter the Heavenly Han House by the accomplishment of the exam. It was a truly fair competition, and they had to rely on their strength. Each of those disciples had already earned some respect due to their own strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still leaning against the wall and tilted his head back slightly. A casual smile was still on his face as he stared indifferently at Zane.</p>

  <p>He had never wanted to compete with anyone when he came to the Heavenly Han House. With the Han Clan's Floating Island as his focus, Luo Luo Zheng wished to quietly pass the exam. However, Zane inexplicably had to target him.</p>

  <p>"Throw the White Jade Token in your hand to the sky. If you don't dare, giving up now will save you some face," Zane said in an arrogant tone.</p>

  <p>He still wanted to provoke Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the one hundred thousand proving godly warriors had tossed their White Jade Tokens up into the air. Most of the energy that surrounded the tokens had already dissipated. The tokens were densely packed in the air, just like a flock of small white birds that were suspended in the air. It was an extremely spectacular sight.</p>

  <p>Only a very small number of the proving godly warriors had yet to act.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was one of them.</p>
