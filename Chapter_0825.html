  <p>After a long and tiring journey, Luo Luo Zheng slowly retracted his consciousness from the universe and stopped his meditation.</p>

  <p>As his consciousness fell back inside, a tremor suddenly hit Luo Zheng's still body, after which, he took a deep breath and opened his eyes, looking at the sky full of stars.</p>

  <p>Phoebe maintained a distance of over ten feet from Luo Luo Zheng. Her slender body was leaning on the edge of a building as her beautiful eyes quietly stared at the remarkable young man in front of her. She could feel that there was something strange about Luo Luo Zheng, but she could not pinpoint exactly what it was.</p>

  <p>"Was it fun to roam about in the great universe?" The red dragon laughed and asked as he sensed Luo Luo Zheng come back.</p>

  <p>In the universe, Luo Luo Zheng had received quite a lot of shocks and was still pondering over them. At this very moment too, his consciousness was still communicating with the light purple star. He tilted his head and looked at a certain corner of the sky.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his astonishing eyesight, he was able to distinguish the light purple star in a single glance.</p>

  <p>"I've established a connection with a star, how can I draw upon its power?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"What!? You succeeded at your first attempt only?" The red dragon ejaculated in shock.</p>

  <p>It had taken the red dragon a full five years to communicate with the stars for the first time!</p>

  <p>It was said to be almost impossible to tame a star, and it was even more difficult to establish a connection with the star. In order to communicate with the stars, the red dragon had traveled in the universe for a total of five years, before he finally found a star willing to connect with him.</p>

  <p>However, it was totally different in Luo Zheng's case! It didn't even take him a single day! The very first time he had traversed through the great universe, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to obtain the acceptance of a star. When he came to know about this, the red dragon was nearly speechless with shock.</p>

  <p>At that time, the cyan dragon laughed and remarked lightly, "Brother, don't forget, this is Luo Zheng's fate in play."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, you are right!" The red dragon had almost forgotten that Luo Luo Zheng was blessed with the fate of a man who was destined to fight and win in this world.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon race was very strong, and the red dragon's strength back then had been unimaginably strong. But, even today, his destiny was not necessarily better than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>All those warriors in the world who possessed the fate to fight were said to be the favored ones of the world. This meant that very few creatures could have better destiny and luck than Luo Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the approval of a star, he would be able to draw out its star power.</p>

  <p>According to the methods mentioned in the Stellar Body, Luo Luo Zheng tried to communicate with the star with his mind. The star at the edge of the sky suddenly started twinkling in response, and a faint starlight appeared on the surface of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Standing not far away from him, Phoebe's eyes abruptly went wide in shock when she noticed the change in Luo Zheng's body!</p>

  <p>She obviously couldn't understand why a faint light had suddenly appeared on Luo Zheng's body. Although Phoebe didn't know the fact that this light came from a star, she had always been very sensitive and perceptive to strong powers as a member of the Demon Night race. She could feel an immense power from the light around Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>'What kind of cultivation method is this fellow practicing?' Phoebe had numerous doubts in her mind, but she was not in a position to ask and clarify them. All warriors had their own secrets, not to mention the fact that Luo Luo Zheng was a human, which meant he belonged to a different race, so it was impossible for him to tell her the truth.</p>

  <p>The first half of the Stellar Body had a total of eight moves.</p>

  <p>After drawing upon the star power, Luo Luo Zheng somehow suppressed his urge to practice the following parts immediately. He had walked out of the Tower of Sin to draw upon the power of the stars only, and it was better to rent a practicing room if he wanted to practice the complete cultivation method.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not want his Transcendent Divine Might to be exposed in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>If not for Phoebe helping him all the way to the Tower of Sin, Luo Luo Zheng would probably have found a reason to chase her away.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng returned to the Tower of Sin, the first thing he did was to step onto the stage.</p>

  <p>In just a day's time, every single war fighter on the first floor had come to know that Luo Luo Zheng was not someone they could defeat.</p>

  <p>Boris, an important figure of the ogre race, had already warned the ogre race members on the first floor to not attack Luo Luo Zheng and stay away.</p>

  <p>War fighters from the other races too didn't dare to step onto the arena once they weighed their pros and cons against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In this way, Luo Luo Zheng encountered what was known as a "default victory". As long as he could maintain a streak of this "default victory" for the next two days straight, he would be able to advance to the next floor without any fighting.</p>

  <p>After leaving the arena, Luo Luo Zheng returned to his practicing room and focused on his cultivation. Although he did not have the Lucky Light to help him improve his cultivation, he still had a lot of things to practice and digest.</p>

  <p>He practiced continuously till the next day after which, Luo Luo Zheng once again stepped onto the stage and once again encountered a default victory. No living being on the arena dared to challenge him.</p>

  <p>After three consecutive days of default victory, Luo Luo Zheng finally obtained the qualification to advance to the next floor.</p>

  <p>Without the slightest hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng entered the next floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The entire Tower of Sin was comprised of fifteen floors.</p>

  <p>According to Phoebe, floors one through five were for the war fighters, beyond which, the building was mostly reserved for the war generals.</p>

  <p>Above tenth floor, the remaining five floors were full of war lords.</p>

  <p>The facilities on the second floor were almost exactly the same as those on the first floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors of the second floor were slightly stronger than on the first floor.</p>

  <p>As he stepped onto the second floor, Luo Luo Zheng saw a woman from the Demon Night race standing in the center of the arena. As he watched, he noticed that no challenger was daring enough to step into the arena in front of this woman.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Luo Zheng, the woman from the Demon Night race was also about to encounter a "default victory".</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members were known to have stronger bodies than other races. Furthermore, this woman was a war general. The cultivators on the second floor of the Tower of Sin were only very slightly stronger than those on the first floor, and the majority of the creatures here were all war fighters. It was understandable that a woman of the Demon Night race would encounter a "default victory" on this floor.</p>

  <p>"God! It's Teresa! I didn't know she had come to the Tower of Sin!" Phoebe, who was behind Luo Luo Zheng, suddenly had a look of surprise on her face as she spoke.</p>

  <p>The girl from the Demon Night race who was on stage right now was called Teresa, and she was also a genius from the sacred place of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Since the strength of the Demon Night race was much higher than the other races, they would head to the Tower of Sin when they were still a war fighter, and quickly improve their cultivation bases during the fights.</p>

  <p>However, Teresa had been cultivating in seclusion in the Demon Night race's sacred place for years until she had reached the cultivation of a fifth level war general. Only then had she entered the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"She is a divine-level talent of our sacred place! She is very strong even though she's only a fifth level war general. Even though my cultivation level is higher than hers, I still wouldn't be a match against her." Phoebe told Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"A divine-level talent from the Demon Night race..." A light flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng wanted to fight Teresa, Phoebe advised him against it, "I wouldn't recommend you to challenge Teresa. I think you should wait until her default victory is announced and choose a different opponent!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your advice." A noncommittal smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>On the stage, Teresa proudly glanced at her surroundings before coldly asking, "Is there anyone who would dare to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>If she obtained a default victory today, it would be her third such victory in succession. During the last three days, no one from any race had dared to challenge her.</p>

  <p>In fact, Teresa was very dissatisfied with the rules of the Tower of Sin. Why did she have to attain a default victory for three consecutive days before being able to advance to the next floor? This was wasting her time!</p>

  <p>Her goal was to enter the tenth floor as quickly as possible. Considering her strength, she would be able to obtain the highest amount of Lucky Light by staying on the tenth floor. Her cultivation speed would also be the fastest.</p>

  <p>What annoyed Teresa most was that she had previously been in the second floor with two days of default victory, but on the third day, a fool had stepped onto the stage and challenged her. In her fury, Teresa had killed the challenger in an instant! But now that the third day was not a default victory, she had to wait another three days.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that her last instant kill was quite intimidating. Finally, no more fool dared to challenge her. She only needed to wait a little longer before obtaining the qualification to ascend to the third floor!</p>

  <p>However, right at that moment, a figure walked onto the arena. It was no one other than Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>Teresa did not want anyone to appear on the arena not because she was afraid of any opponent on this floor. The real reason was that regardless of the strength of her opponent, the rules stated that she had to start her round of three consecutive days of default victory once again if anyone challenged her. This meant that she would have to wait for three more days before she could enter the third floor of the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>For that reason alone, when she saw Luo Luo Zheng walk onto the stage, Teresa was about to go crazy.</p>

  <p>She sized up Luo Luo Zheng from head to toe, her gaze frosty in her fury. "I see that there is yet another stupid war fighter who wants to challenge me to a battle! It seems like my tactics last time weren't cruel enough and didn't teach you guys a painful enough lesson. This time, it is going to be even more ruthless!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder just how ruthless it will be?" Luo Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>Teresa took out a short dagger from her space ring and coldly replied,</p>

  <p>"Ruthless enough to send you into the deepest pits of despair!"</p>
