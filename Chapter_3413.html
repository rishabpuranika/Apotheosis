<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The giant eye's pupil shrank in horror upon seeing the cyan light from the silk cloth.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The blood red force of fear formed a helix, shooting toward Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>Such force of fear was enough to push ordinary Souls of Light into endless fear until they died in the throes of madness.</p>

  <p>Yan, however, showed no fear. She gently waved the cyan silk cloth, which promptly extended up to ten feet in the wind.</p>

  <p>As the silk cloth unfurled, it began to spin in front of Yan, forming circles of cyan light.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The force of fear came into contact with the cyan light. But it evaporated instantly, like snowflakes in the blazing sun.</p>

  <p>"The force of fear is indeed strong in some aspects. No matter how strong a man's will is, after all, there would always be something that they are afraid of. However, attacks like that are easy enough to shatter," Yan said calmly.</p>

  <p>Some evil and sinister methods were very horrible. But these methods were difficult to use, not because they were not of the right origin.</p>

  <p>In such a big world, there were always so many people who wanted to be stronger.</p>

  <p>However, those who resorted to vicious means, though powerful, had their limits. To become truly strong warriors, people must find the right way forward.</p>

  <p>"Braveness Rain!"</p>

  <p>Yan shouted. The cyan light emanating from the silk cloth transformed into cyan raindrops which poured down from the sky, heading straight for the giant eye.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the cyan raindrops, the giant eye released panic consciousness again.</p>

  <p>Its two abilities, however, wouldn't work this time.</p>

  <p>One of them was the Authentic Visual World, which was an auxiliary ability to help it distinguish the enemy's weakness more clearly and see through the illusions of magic arrays. But this ability couldn't help it block the enemy's attacks directly.</p>

  <p>The other was the force of fear, which was easily parried by the silk cloth.</p>

  <p>This seemingly unremarkable silk cloth was, in fact, a treasure of the Other Shore obtained by the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>True to its name, the silk cloth could summon rain.</p>

  <p>There was a rain forest in Stage Twenty-one of the Other Shore, shrouded by cyan rain over the years.</p>

  <p>Once the Souls of Light entered the rain forest and the cyan rain touched them, the fear in their hearts would be dispelled.</p>

  <p>They would feel a surge of blind confidence and braveness.</p>

  <p>Some people would fuse with the cyan rain as an auxiliary Other Shore Token. During critical moments, they would use it to fight against the fear in their hearts so that they would become more valiant.</p>

  <p>Yan's silk cloth was made of melted cyan rain.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood behind the silk cloth, feeling the light of the cyan rain. An irresistible impulse arose in his heart, imbuing him with renewed confidence.</p>

  <p>'But this confidence is too unrealistic, '</p>

  <p>Zheng thought. He circulated the mind method of the Flow Swordsmanship to suppress the effects of the cyan rain.</p>

  <p>"Click! Click! Click! Click! Click!"</p>

  <p>Although the giant eye flew fast, it couldn't dodge all the tiny water drops.</p>

  <p>The cyan rain poured over a large area.</p>

  <p>Some of the raindrops made contact with the giant eye. Immediately, a sizzling sound could be heard.</p>

  <p>The rain could melt the Dreaded Eye Demon!</p>

  <p>The giant eye quickly fled in pain.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, let's go after it!"</p>

  <p>Yan touched the center of the silk cloth with her finger and rushed forward swiftly.</p>

  <p>Zheng also flew up, following suit.</p>

  <p>When the main peak was broken, Zheng had been at a loss.</p>

  <p>He had one Eye of Will, so he knew how powerful the thing was.</p>

  <p>But the giant eye at the top of the main peak was more powerful than the Eye of Will he had. If they found no way to expel the force of fear, the giant eye would be an invincible existence for them.</p>

  <p>But Yan quietly passed on a message to him, telling him that the Pear Hill had a plan.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a warm sense of pride seeing her like this. She was now completely independent.</p>

  <p>But because the Chaotic Source Spirits were on the attack, Zheng was still worried about her safety and chose to protect her.</p>

  <p>Click! Click! Click!</p>

  <p>As the silk cloth rolled in the wind, cyan raindrops sprinkled everywhere.</p>

  <p>Some fell accidentally on several Ear Mice. In an instant, their cowardly nature dissipated and they began charging at the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Continually eroded by the cyan raindrops, the giant eye, originally as clear as a mirror, was now dim and riddled with pits and holes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The giant eye fled to the other side of the main peak in a bid to avoid the raindrops.</p>

  <p>Yan stepped lightly on the surface of the main peak. Then she flew down the side like a storm, countless raindrops at her flanks.</p>

  <p>But just as she flipped over, a voice suddenly called out.</p>

  <p>"What an interesting thing. I'll take it!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A black figure lunged at Yan at a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>Yan didn't expect there was a man hiding at the side of the main peak. Her face darkened as she drew the silk cloth closer to her. "Shield!" she spat out.</p>

  <p>An invisible light curtain covered her in a flash.</p>

  <p>With her current theurgy, Yan could now launch an attack by merely speaking.</p>

  <p>One word was enough to protect herself.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be easy for talents at the same level to break the light curtain.</p>

  <p>But the black figure was much stronger than Yan's expectations. He reached out a hand emitting countless colors. Then a white light burst out. The light curtain broke, as if it was as fragile as glass.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Yan then recognized the man. It was none other than the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at her with a wicked smile.</p>

  <p>The force of fear was the biggest obstacle in his way. If the giant eye restrained him, he would find no way to resist.</p>

  <p>But he could fix that problem with this silk cloth.</p>

  <p>He was determined to rob it from Yan on the spot.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God tried to grab the silk cloth, a sword shot out from behind Yan's body. A sharp sword radiance extended and stabbed into the Evil God's palm.</p>

  <p>The smirk was wiped off the Evil God's face as the sword light went through his hand. His face darkened.</p>

  <p>A ray of colorful light gathered on his palm. It was the Ways-blending Energy!</p>

  <p>The diamond-shaped Ways-blending Energy had been piled up to more than one hundred and twenty layers by the Evil God. It was extremely powerful and could overpower the Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy, condensed to the extreme, burst instantly when it made contact with the sword radiance. The overwhelming power spread in all directions like a scorching sun, attracting the eyes of many people and even the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Other people would probably be immediately swallowed up by such power.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was also very familiar with the Ways-blending Energy!</p>

  <p>The sword attack he had launched was to force the Evil God to retreat.</p>

  <p>The instant the Ways-blending Energy burst out, Zheng had grabbed one of Yan's hands. Yan, still clutching the silk cloth, was pulled backward to a safer distance.</p>

  <p>This would be the first time Zheng fought with the Evil God since he released the latter out of his inner world.</p>
