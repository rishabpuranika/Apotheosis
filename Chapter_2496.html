<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2496 The Sun Essence Flames </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The East Hall was built with a particularly distinctive translucent glaze.</p>

  <p>When one stepped on the ground, the impact triggered ripples, as though one was walking on a dense lake.</p>

  <p>When Troy entered the hall, he walked along a long, thin corridor.</p>

  <p>A small door waited at the end of the hall.</p>

  <p>Behind the door, he saw a huge gray chair in front of him, Nicholas lying on his back atop it? he held a cup of diluted-blood-like wine in his hand.</p>

  <p>A sweet, charming smell from the liquid filled the hall.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Before this sight, Troy knelt to the ground, saying nothing.</p>

  <p>"I thought we were bound to win this time but I was mistaken," Nicholas said lightly.</p>

  <p>"It's all my fault," Troy said, bowing his head.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Nicholas looked down at Troy and sneered. "You merely sent Duke to the debate venue. You couldn't even see the whole process, so you can't be blamed for that."</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Dongfang Clan's group, Troy couldn't take any real part in the debate.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't help but blame himself, not willing to accept the result.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan's plan was absolutely flawless from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>Until now, Troy couldn't tell what went wrong? how could the candidates escape in the face of the fiend?</p>

  <p>It was too disconcerting to him.</p>

  <p>Looking at Troy with his head bowed, Nicholas stepped onto the ground and stood up, his burly figure rising from the chair. He poured the wine onto the ground and said calmly, "Harold may have known of our plan."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand." Troy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The fear incarnations that the candidates summoned in the debate venue held their own memories? what if they summoned strong fear incarnations to serve them?" Nicholas asked.</p>

  <p>Something clicked in Troy's head when he heard this.</p>

  <p>"Although I don't know exactly who they summoned, that's the only explanation that makes sense," Nicholas continued. "The captain of the ship is standing opposite us. If he discovered Luo Zheng's identity and voluntarily gave him the inheritance, you couldn't stop him. So there's no need to blame yourself. It would be good if we succeeded but don't be too worried about the failure now. Get up."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Troy said as he stood up promptly.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' words comforted him somehow.</p>

  <p>The master at the Other Shore Realm was on Luo Zheng's side. If he wanted to give Luo Zheng his inheritance at the debate venue, who could stop him?</p>

  <p>"But this time, the Sword Clan?" Troy started.</p>

  <p>Nicholas stopped him with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"The Sword Clan will take Harold's side sooner or later, but they're faster than I expected them to be. Since they can't wait, that's not on me. Some changes are bound to happen."</p>

  <p>A full day in the divine land consisted of 24 hours.</p>

  <p>In the early morning, the great ball of fire known as the sun would rise gradually from the east, illuminating every corner of the land.</p>

  <p>Then, it flew past the divine land extremely quickly.</p>

  <p>When the sun reached just above the Time Sea, it meant noontime in the divine land.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, the sun would reach the far west above the Sunrest Tree, indicating dusk.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Sword Divine City atop the Sunrest Tree within the Non-combat Zone?</p>

  <p>Marsh, Gibson, Harold, and the others were looking up into the sky like statues.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the sun's afterglow, Marsh broke the silence. "It's time. I'll take you up."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only nodded.</p>

  <p>Then, he grabbed Luo Zheng's hand and with a flash, the two disappeared right before Harold's and Yan's eyes.</p>

  <p>Though Harold could fly into the air with Luo Zheng, as a consummate True God, he couldn't move as far as Marsh could. The sun in itself was a fast-moving fireball and he couldn't afford to miss the perfect timing. They were left with no choice but to let Marsh take Luo Zheng to the sun.</p>

  <p>Everything before Luo Zheng seemed to turn black before he was suddenly pulled up into the air.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"What a strong gale!"</p>

  <p>The wind roared past, blowing on his face like knives made of air. Even though he did have an extremely strong body, Luo Zheng could feel the gale leave thin white marks on his body.</p>

  <p>Now, the sun above his head was several times larger in his sight.</p>

  <p>"Once again!"</p>

  <p>Pinpointing his position, Marsh continued to drag Luo Zheng through space.</p>

  <p>After the second spatial transference, Luo Zheng was now several times closer to the sun.</p>

  <p>When he looked down, he could see the entire Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>It seemed like a small, semicircular pool with the huge Sunrest Tree in the middle like some kind of octopus. Everything seemed incomparably small to Luo Zheng from such a great height.</p>

  <p>After Marsh moved with Luo Zheng through space for the third time, the burning flames turned into irregular sharp swords before falling from above.</p>

  <p>These were the Sun Essence Flames.</p>

  <p>The flames were divided into three layers. But even the outermost layer alone was enough to burn everything to the ground.</p>

  <p>Ordinary True Gods wouldn't have been able to withstand it.</p>

  <p>The two were still quite a long way from the sun. Though Marsh could withstand the flames, he was afraid that Luo Zheng couldn't? he created a halo in his hand, ready to cover Luo Zheng's body with it.</p>

  <p>But right at this moment, Luo Zheng's body suddenly began glowing with tiny golden Sanskrit words? it seemed he was absorbing the Sun Essence Flames.</p>

  <p>"You're refining your body with the flames?" Marsh was completely astonished. "You're absorbing them!"</p>

  <p>He himself didn't dare to absorb the Sun Essence Flames for his own use.</p>

  <p>Even the Holy Beings couldn't tame the manic flames, but Luo Zheng was absorbing them continuously!</p>

  <p>There was a legend in the divine land saying that there was a huge palace in the sun? anyone who lived there was qualified to control the divine land.</p>

  <p>In an era when the divine citizens remained ignorant, only the most exceptional True Gods could become Holy Beings, and only a select few of them truly challenged the sun.</p>

  <p>In the end, they were all burnt to ashes by the sun without exception. But because the Holy Beings could make themselves immortal through universes, they eventually recovered.</p>

  <p>Since then, no one ever dared try to get close to the sun.</p>

  <p>It was an absolute shock to Marsh to see Luo Zheng absorbing the Sun Essence Flames so freely.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng continued absorbing the flames, Marsh remained in the air, waiting for the other to absorb as much as he wanted to.</p>
