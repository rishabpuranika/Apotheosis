<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord's origin was extremely mysterious mostly because it was literally ancient history that had been forgotten due to the passage of time.</p>

  <p>This underground palace had already been explored before but none of the warriors who went in had managed to successfully unravel the mystery behind the Supreme Lord's true identity.</p>

  <p>This wasn't a normal occurrence. The origins of each and every Supreme Lord were meticulously recorded, documented, and compiled ever since the start of the grand era. To forget such important information was extremely rare. A Supreme Lord, after all, had a fixed, constant position in the universe and the replacement of one was usually only due to the death of a former one, which would no doubt generate a lot of attention and shock from the heavens.</p>

  <p>However, nobody found any clues or documents pertaining to the origins of this Supreme Lord in the Dark World.</p>

  <p>The Nine-head Snake statue at the entrance of the underground palace served as the only hint that the Supreme Lord might likely possess this creature's bloodline. There were nine entrances, each corresponding to an individual snake head.</p>

  <p>Each head meant an opportunity to open up the underground palace.</p>

  <p>Every time an entrance was opened, the snake's head would break and an enchanted barrier would open. The underground palace would then patiently wait for the next time it could be opened.</p>

  <p>Xun had entered this palace a hundred thousand years ago through the sixth snake head. A hundred thousand years later, Lincoln obtained the opportunity to explore the palace through the seventh snake head.</p>

  <p>The sacred places in the Dark World paid careful attention to this underground palace and were always aware whenever someone was able to gain the opportunity to open up an entrance.</p>

  <p>If Lincoln could open the entrance, then the sacred places would waste no time sending their young elites over!</p>

  <p>Everyone waited with bated breath as Lincoln entered the seventh snake head. It was incredibly silent, especially since the palace was located miles underground. A needle dropped on the floor would no doubt echo through this palace.</p>

  <p>However, the silence was broken by a sound.</p>

  <p>"Tick tack…"</p>

  <p>It was the sound of water drops dripping onto the ground.</p>

  <p>It didn't sound too far away and the seven Hou brothers were quickly on guard.</p>

  <p>Despite being Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, they were scared as well.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of things that could go bump in the dark, especially here.</p>

  <p>"Tick tack. Tick tack. Tick tack…"</p>

  <p>The droplets had gotten faster, echoing all throughout the underground palace's entrance.</p>

  <p>Freya was visibly afraid and moved closer towards Zheng. "What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and quickly activated his magical eyes skill.</p>

  <p>A tinge of green flashed across his eyes as he surveyed the dark spots where no light was present. "Lincoln!" he called out in a clear voice.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take you to open that entrance?!"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment!" Lincoln said. His voice was faint since he had already completely entered the seventh snake head.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up, please! We might be in a bit of trouble here," he said.</p>

  <p>His tone was very calm but his words did nothing to comfort Freya.</p>

  <p>Zheng was an omnipotent being in her eyes. For someone like him to describe something as trouble meant whatever was hiding in that dark place was horrible and frightening.</p>

  <p>Adrian thought the same thing. Despite being the weakest, he was the cleverest among the group. He had already witnessed Zheng's abilities back in the Willow Island so he didn't dare doubt his words now.</p>

  <p>The Hou brothers weren't that worried, however. They were quite confident with their cultivation base, perhaps even a bit too cocky. Ab snorted at Zheng's words, "If you don't have the guts, then maybe you should leave. A coward isn't worthy of getting a share of the Dark World's secret treasures. Coy, go take a look!"</p>

  <p>Zheng did not grace him with a reply, his green eyes still fixated on the darkness that was laid in front of them. However, hearing Ab order Coy to go check it made him smile.</p>

  <p>Coy gave Zheng a look of disdain as he passed by him before entering the darkness.</p>

  <p>This was the dark space at the side of the Nine-head Snake's statue.</p>

  <p>Despite having a Glint Pearl in his hand, Coy was only able to see the surrounding area around him.</p>

  <p>"Coy! Did you find anything?" Ab asked.</p>

  <p>Coy let out a booming laugh and answered, "There's nothing here! We really have some idiots for companions. Look at how nervous they all got! I bet even the sound of the wind would freak those cowards out. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>His brothers laughed after hearing that but it was only the band of siblings who found amusement in their situation.</p>

  <p>Freya turned to Zheng and activated her life vitality to talk to him, "There seems to be something wrong with Coy's Glint Pearl. Why is the light coming from it so dim?"</p>

  <p>Glint Pearls were divided into levels. The one Coy had was by no means at the highest level but it was still an extraordinary item. It should've exuded a lot more light.</p>

  <p>"If I'm not wrong, there should be a trace of the Dark Law around here that is suppressing the light of the Glint Pearl. That guy is most probably going to get himself into big trouble," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Coy was grinning while his brothers were laughing. However, their amusement froze when they suddenly saw something in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Coy didn't seem to have noticed anything but suddenly felt a chill at the expression on his brothers' faces. He turned his head and waved the Glint Pearl around but still couldn't find anything in the darkness.</p>

  <p>He heaved a sigh of relief before turning to his brothers with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Come on guys! You were all messing with me just now! Stop that!"</p>

  <p>However, his brothers still sported the same look of horror on their faces.</p>

  <p>One of them even pointed at Coy's body. It was then that Coy shook the Glint Pearl and aimed it towards himself.</p>

  <p>The sight made Freya gasp and she couldn't help but tightly grasp onto Zheng's clothes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his brothers retreated a few steps back in unison!</p>

  <p>The sight was horrifying. The Glint Pearl perfectly illuminated the way the darkness literally consumed Coy, eating away at his flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>The weird thing was that he didn't feel any pain nor did he feel anything was amiss.</p>

  <p>However, the horrifying sight still overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhhhhhhh!" he screamed, running back towards everyone!</p>

  <p>"No! Don't come here!"</p>

  <p>"Just stay there and die!" his brothers all said.</p>

  <p>Despite being initially confident in their skills, their brute strength would only prove useful against ferocious beasts. The mysteries of the unknown were way scarier than any vicious creature.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Freya asked Zheng in panic.</p>

  <p>However, he merely grabbed Freya's waist and let out one single order,</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Their group was quick to follow his command, along with the six brothers.</p>

  <p>Coy, who had been running towards them, was no match for the corrosive darkness. He rapidly lost the remainder of his body and all that remained was his skeleton that smashed loudly onto the ground. The Glint Pearl he once held as a beacon also rolled down the floor and reflected the dancing little moths in the dark.</p>
