<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2320 Protect The Goddess Statue </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the Goddess Statue for a long time before finally opening his mouth and asking, "Who is this goddess?"</p>

  <p>Clueless, Aleyna and Kelsey shook their heads in response.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that they had entered the Time Sea Forbidden Land, too. Although they had done some research beforehand and known that the Goddess Statue was here, they didn't know much about it.</p>

  <p>"People have two conjectures about the identity of this woman,"</p>

  <p>Reginald said. "One, she might be the leader of the Sun Blind race."</p>

  <p>"The leader of the Sun Blind race?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Sun Blind race never revealed her true face to others.</p>

  <p>In the past countless divine eras, no one had seen her true face, not even the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>As the one who had control over the Time Sea Forbidden Land, it was indeed possible for the leader of the Sun Blind race to put a statue of herself here. However, it was difficult to think of a reason why she would do that.</p>

  <p>"The second guess is that she is the leader of the Time Guardians,"</p>

  <p>Reginald continued. "However, this is just a wild theory. No one knows exactly what kind of race the Time Guardian is. All we know is that there is a race guarding time, but the existence of this race hasn't been verified."</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is," Luo Zheng said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Reginald knew more about the Time Sea Forbidden Land than almost any of the True Gods, so if he wasn't able to give a definite answer, it was safe to say that it would be hard to confirm the identity of the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>After answering Luo Zheng, Reginald went to set up the Star Doors with Pascal.</p>

  <p>Noticing the disappointment on Luo Zheng's face, Aleyna blinked her eyes and asked, "You think this goddess looks familiar, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave her a strange look. "How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"By the expression on your face. You seem to have met this woman before. Or does she look like your family?" Aleyna smiled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a bit taken aback by how easily Aleyna had read him, but then he nodded reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who this goddess is, but look carefully at her face. Don't you think she looks a bit like you?" Aleyna asked gently.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took another look at the face of the Goddess Statue and realized that Aleyna was right.</p>

  <p>The goddess did look like him.</p>

  <p>Of course, considering that she looked almost exactly like Yan, it wasn't strange at all.</p>

  <p>After all, there was some resemblance between him and Yan since they were siblings.</p>

  <p>But Aleyna's words sowed another doubt in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be a coincidence that the Goddess Statue looked so much like Yan.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that this goddess was their mother?</p>

  <p>Although he was looking only at a statue, Luo Zheng was sure that he had seen this woman before. Had his mother only a head left?</p>

  <p>It was hard for Luo Zheng to accept this conjecture.</p>

  <p>Looking at the complex expression on Luo Zheng's face, Aleyna smiled. She knew that his background was complicated and that the statue had some sort of meaning to him, so she said a few words of comfort. "Don't think too much. There are many things in this world that are not within your control. Perhaps the truth is not what you think."</p>

  <p>"You are right." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>It was no use thinking too much. Sooner or later, he would find out the truth. Accepting this fact, he looked at the bottom of the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>Under the Goddess Statue, Pascal activated a scroll and spread out another Star Door.</p>

  <p>After the blue Star Door appeared, Pascal went straight into it and disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>A short while later, he shot toward them from a nearby hill and waved. A temporary transmission array was set up after the two Star Doors were connected.</p>

  <p>When Pascal returned, Reginald suddenly raised his voice and said,</p>

  <p>"Now that the two Star Doors have been built successfully, we have a way out. This time, it might be more difficult for us to protect the Goddess Statue, but the rewards we will earn will be more than ever, so I hope that you all will do your best!"</p>

  <p>After that, Reginald took the lead in walking to the Goddess Statue. He reached out his palm and patted the bottom of the statue, leaving a complete palm print on it.</p>

  <p>Following that, the other top-rank True Gods walked over and left faint palm prints on the base of the Goddess Statue one after the other. Soon, it was the turn of the mid-rank True Gods and low-rank True Gods. The last ones were Luo Zheng, Liusu, Aleyna, and a few others.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng reached out his hand and patted the statue, the eyes under the mask of the leader of the Sun Blind race flickered, revealing a trace of concern in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng gently slapped his palm on the bottom of the Goddess Statue, leaving a faint palm print just like the others. Nothing out of the ordinary happened.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Sun Blind race gazed at him for a long time, and a trace of doubt appeared in her eyes before quickly being replaced by disappointment and regret.</p>

  <p>However, the other Holy Beings didn't notice the change in her expression as their eyes were focused on the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The group of consummate True Gods, including Rachelle, were madly fleeing from a huge monster that they had angered in the third stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Beneath the Goddess Statue, all the palm prints of the True Gods were imprinted. The tall Goddess Statue suddenly emitted a faint green light that slowly rose from the bottom and filled the entire statue like a green liquid.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, be careful. Even if it's not your first time entering the Time Sea Forbidden Land, I have to remind you that this is the only way through which we can enter the second stage. Later, there will be a massive amount of beasts attacking the Goddess Statue, and we'll have to do everything we can to protect it. If the statue is completely destroyed, we will lose the chance to enter the second stage! If you find yourself too exhausted to fight, you can pass through the Star Door and rest outside for a while. But please return to participate in the battle soon as we'll need all the hands we can get." While Reginald was speaking to everyone in a calm voice, the valley began to tremble, and a multicolored light curtain appeared around it, enveloping the entire valley.</p>

  <p>Seeing the change in the valley, he smiled faintly. "It's already starting!"</p>

  <p>"We've become locked in the valley after activating the Goddess Statue."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flickered with understanding. The reason they had built two Star Doors here was to have a way out in case they lost. Otherwise, they would be stuck here.</p>

  <p>No wonder some of the True Gods had previously complained that they wouldn't move forward without the Star Doors. In the worst-case scenario, the Star Doors could end up saving their lives.</p>

  <p>The whole valley began to rumble.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a huge black mass of objects emerged from the four entrances around the valley.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a strange rhythm reached everyone's ears. It sounded like countless people letting out a series of deep breaths at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Black butterflies," Luo Zheng said lightly.</p>

  <p>"This is the first wave of attacks. Everyone, be careful. Rhyme Butterflies are ferocious beasts from the Dark Fire Forbidden Area. They are not that powerful, but the flames they will turn into after their deaths are very difficult to handle. Make sure you're not surrounded by them,"</p>

  <p>Reginald warned.</p>

  <p>Four groups of Rhyme Butterflies fluttered in through the four entrances of the valley and moved toward the Goddess Statue in spirals. With their continuous movement, the rhythmic breathing sound became more and more intense.</p>

  <p>"Go!" As soon as Reginald gave the order, he rushed out first.</p>

  <p>The True Gods around the Goddess Statue also rushed toward the Rhyme Butterflies, and Luo Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Just Rhyme Butterflies. You look as if you're facing a formidable enemy. I've wandered through the Dark Fire Forbidden Area several times. These butterflies are not even worth mentioning!"</p>

  <p>Langston smiled coldly and formed a claw with one hand. Then, with red light flashing from his fingertips, he raised the claw above his head and waved it.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Several thin blood lines spiraled in the air like waves, forming countless irregular curves in the air. They formed a thin net that covered the group of Rhyme Butterflies in front of him.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the Rhyme Butterflies that had come into contact with the blood lines were cut into pieces, and their broken black wings flew in all directions.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Langston quickly made his retreat.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the dead Rhyme Butterflies behind him exploded into blazing flames.</p>

  <p>Just as Reginald had said, the Rhyme Butterflies weren't very powerful, but after their deaths, flames named "Spirit Burning Fire" erupted. Spirit Burning Fire could cover a range of several miles, and it was difficult to avoid it. Even a True God could be devoured by the fire.</p>

  <p>Langston was experienced and chose to retreat immediately to avoid being swallowed by the flames after killing hundreds of Rhyme Butterflies.</p>
