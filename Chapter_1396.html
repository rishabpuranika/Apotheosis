<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Of course, Layla was capable of dealing with these annoying opponents.</p>

  <p>However, after being targeted by them so deviously, she became rather irritable.</p>

  <p>She and Luo Zheng entered the twentieth round not long after these bloodthirsty fights.</p>

  <p>Twenty rounds was the best result that previous warriors of the thirteen palaces had achieved.</p>

  <p>Before this, no one had been able to pass the twentieth round because, the opponents at that level were all warriors at the middle stage of the Soul Sea Realm who had undergone at least four big Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>For the talented martial artists of the thirteen palaces, it was not difficult to challenge those above their cultivation levels. However, dealing with several Soul Sea Realm martial artists at the same time was quite challenging.</p>

  <p>So it was in this round that Luo Zheng and Layla finally felt the immense pressure they were facing.</p>

  <p>There was a huge chasm between the Soul Sea Realm and the Life and Death Realm. What was most troublesome were the domains of the Soul Sea Realm warriors. The suppression of each of these domains had caused a lot of trouble for Luo Zheng and Layla.</p>

  <p>"Finally, things have become tricky for them. These two should not have stopped at the twentieth round, right?" a palace leader asked.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord nodded his head indifferently. "That's hard to say.</p>

  <p>This is after all a one-to-many fight, completely different from the test of the Enchanted Barrier Tower. The opponents they have to face are also vastly distinct�"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng could fight back the attacks of the Soul Sea Realm warriors even though he is just at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm. I wonder what he will be capable of once he breaks through to the Soul Sea Realm." The leaders were paying more attention to Luo Zheng because of his extraordinary performance in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>However, another palace leader had a different question in mind. He looked at Yolande and said, "I seem to have overlooked something. How many petals did Zheng's Lotus Flower have?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this question from the palace leader, everyone looked at Yolande curiously.</p>

  <p>Before the warriors participated in Passing the Torch, a selection process had been held for all the martial artists from the palaces. The Red Cloud Ring could sense the strength of the warriors and roughly deduce the number of lotus petals that they had activated.</p>

  <p>But Yolande shook her head and said, "I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You don't know? Could it be that Luo Zheng failed the test?" a palace leader asked.</p>

  <p>"No." Yolande continued, "When Luo Zheng passed through the Red Cloud Ring, its sensing power closed because it reached its saturation point. It was impossible to deduce how many petals Luo Zheng had activated."</p>

  <p>Hearing Yolande's words, many leaders were shocked.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord stared, his eyes flashing. "Does that mean it's likely that Luo Zheng activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower?"</p>

  <p>In the universe, the Hinayana Lotus Flower and the Mahayana Lotus Flower were both important milestones. Martial artists who could open the Nine-petal Lotus Flower were considered to be top talents, but the number of them who could activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower was few and far between. It was hard to find someone who could achieve this, even among a trillion living beings.</p>

  <p>"How interesting�" One of the world lords said, seemingly lost in thought. "How about later after we give him the pill, we let him take the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill? After he triggers the Heavenly Tribulation, wouldn't we know how many petals he activated in his Lotus Flower?"</p>

  <p>"That... doesn't sound very right..." Yolande looked hesitant.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with it? Isn't it normal practice for warriors to trigger Heavenly Tribulation and go through it once they finish the test of Passing the Torch?" another palace leader asked.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists could not wait to take the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill, hoping to enhance their cultivation as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>This was because after undergoing the intense test of Passing the Torch, they often received great insights on martial arts.</p>

  <p>Thus, every time Passing the Torch ended, over a hundred warriors chose to undergo the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>After hearing this suggestion, Yolande finally nodded. "Okay, but I'll let Luo Zheng decide for himself."</p>

  <p>At the moment, the thousands of warriors outside the ancient palace were staring at the battle within the Picture Slab, exclaiming with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Although everyone knew that there were no real deaths in the Illusion Space, the battles within were no different from those in the outside world. When they saw a dangerous situation, they would gasp in shock.</p>

  <p>The difficulty in the twentieth round had increased. Luo Zheng started to find it troublesome to deal with his opponents.</p>

  <p>Although the number of his opponents had reduced to six, all of these warriors of Soul Sea Realm had a tactic of dividing forces. They formed a two-pronged attack. It was difficult to break through this temporary well-planned formation.</p>

  <p>The six warriors were all at the Soul Sea Realm. Before them, Luo Zheng could only be considered a junior.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng had not been defeated under the pincer attack of these six was already a great humiliation to them. It would be a shame if news spread out that six Soul Sea Realm martial artists had joined forces to attack a martial artist who was merely at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>However, as Luo Zheng and the six men fought continuously, they had no time to consider their reputation.</p>

  <p>They discovered that as time passed, Luo Zheng seemed to become more powerful and more in control. Feeling somewhat defeated by Luo Zheng, who was only a kid at the Life and Death Realm, they were embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it made them anxious.</p>

  <p>However, before they went out to fight, Adrian had told them that the most important thing to keep in mind while fighting Luo Zheng was to stay calm. No matter what, as long as they forced Luo Zheng to use his full strength, it would be counted as a victory for them.</p>

  <p>In the end, they did it� They experienced Zheng's true power.</p>

  <p>As warriors of the Upper World, these warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had seen a lot. However, to their surprise, when Zheng's power surged out, they were frightened.</p>

  <p>In order to fight his great power, one of the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm opened the 'Eleventh Earth Domain'.</p>

  <p>The Eleventh Earth Domain that he had comprehended from the Earth Law was the most solid of all domains. The Soul Sea Realm warrior who employed this domain stood ahead in front of the other five warriors.</p>

  <p>However, such a strong domain was still easily shattered by Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng, who was at the Life and Death Realm, charged into the group of warriors of the Soul Sea Realm like a tiger before a flock of sheep. The scene was quite shocking to witness.</p>

  <p>Most of the talents of the thirteen palaces could easily defeat warriors of the Soul Sea Realm in a one-on-one fight. However, there were not many like Luo Zheng who could defeat so many Soul Sea Realm warriors at the same time. Other than him, perhaps only Layla could do it.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's battle ended, Layla too finished fighting. It seemed that Layla had used a powerful trump card, for a cyan stone appeared on her forehead. She had activated the Wrath of the Ocean.</p>

  <p>They both passed the twentieth round�</p>

  <p>The two of them obtained the favored results in the test of Illusion Space at the same time, but it wasn't the end for them.</p>

  <p>Soon, the twenty-first round started�</p>

  <p>Then the twenty-second round�</p>

  <p>Next was the twenty-third round�</p>

  <p>The twenty-fourth round�.</p>

  <p>Having learned from previous experience, no one was willing to guess the limits of their abilities.</p>

  <p>In the Enchanted Barrier Tower, when everyone had assumed Layla's limits in the beginning itself, she had shocked them by reaching twenty-eight thousand miles eventually. Later they predicted that Luo Zheng would not be able to reach thirty thousand miles, but to their bewilderment, he reached thirty-six thousand miles.</p>

  <p>By now everyone knew that they must not assume the strength of these two. It would be a slap in the face for them otherwise. Luo Zheng and Layla had far exceeded their estimations.</p>

  <p>But the Illusion Space was different from the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>Every round of the test involved warriors prepared to fight them.</p>

  <p>Since the test was arranged, there had to be certain limitations.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Willow Island were about fifteen groups of martial artists, divided according to their levels of strength. Each group corresponded to the eleventh to the twenty-fifth rounds of the test in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>The martial artists of the fifteenth group were prisoners of the three cages on the high platform.</p>

  <p>The twenty-fifth round was the final round of the test�</p>

  <p>From beginning to end, Adrian had been the one to work out the strategies and give suggestions. Even though his plan had not been successful against Luo Zheng and Layla, everyone had seen its effect.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they were happy to have Adrian give them orders. At that moment, he once again stepped onto the high platform on top of the enormous square.</p>

  <p>"If we want to fight that woman, we'll have to send these condemned prisoners into the battlefield�"</p>

  <p>"I heard that these condemned prisoners were all extraordinary characters who came from the Villain World!"</p>

  <p>"If they can defeat those two in the ultimate round, they will be able to get their freedom. I believe they would go all out for it, right?"</p>

  <p>Under the gazes of the crowd, Adrian walked toward the tall and sturdy man and asked, "Two people have entered the final round. A man and a woman, which one do you choose to fight?"</p>

  <p>The burly man asked arrogantly, "Are you joking? How could I choose a woman?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest you choose the woman. The man is very strong and has an unfathomable level of strength. I, at least, haven't seen his limits so far,"</p>

  <p>Adrian said in a low voice. After so many rounds, he had not even accomplished his goal. What vexed him especially was that he could not figure out how far Zheng's strength went.</p>

  <p>"How strong is he?" the burly man asked.</p>

  <p>"He's at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm," Adrian replied truthfully.</p>

  <p>The burly man narrowed his eyes and looked at Adrian coldly. "Are you insulting me? Saying that he is strong at that level!"</p>

  <p>Even if the man Adrian had mentioned was considered to be a top talent within the thirteen palaces, the fact that the man was still only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm was the only thing that vexed the burly man.</p>
