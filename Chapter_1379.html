</p>

  <p>"She's already reached the 16, 000th mile. This Layla, she's really amazing?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that this woman is going to be admitted to the Spring Fragrance Pavilion when she passes the test of Passing the Torch!"</p>

  <p>"It's truly impressive. Back when I took the test in the Enchanted Barrier Tower, I was only able to travel 13000 miles. That was already my limit!"</p>

  <p>The leaders of the palaces were all shocked at Layla's capabilities.</p>

  <p>Even though she'd already impressed them earlier, they never thought that she would break a record.</p>

  <p>Everyone was more amazed at what happened next.</p>

  <p>When Layla surpassed the 16000 miles' mark, she increased her speed again. Her body was then covered in a layer of cyan light and a small crack appeared on the spot between her eyebrows where a small cyan stone could be seen.</p>

  <p>The stone was about the size of a fingertip and it looked nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>When the leaders saw the stone, they seemed to be shocked. The old man in cotton clothes even stood up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"The Wrath of the Ocean!"</p>

  <p>"She actually has the Wrath of the Ocean!"</p>

  <p>"That old Kyron really did hide it quite well?."</p>

  <p>Some were surprised while some sighed.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists who were also watching were confused. They didn't know what the Wrath of the Ocean was.</p>

  <p>The old man in cotton clothes descended slowly back to his chair and muttered, "That's not right. If Layla has the Wrath of the Ocean, it's impossible that the Spring Fragrance Pavilion didn't know, and Kyron wouldn't have sent her to participate in Passing the Torch in the first place?"</p>

  <p>"From the looks of it, he probably doesn't know that Layla has the Wrath of the Ocean.." Yolande said as she nodded. She was suddenly looking at Layla in a different light.</p>

  <p>In fact, Yolande had always thought that Luo Luo Zheng would surpass Layla sooner or later. It was something she'd always believed in based on the memories of two of her clones.</p>

  <p>However, when she saw that Layla had the Wrath of the Ocean, she started to question her judgment.</p>

  <p>The Wrath of the Ocean was an extremely special and powerful talent.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, special talents, skills, and physiques weren't uncommon. For instance, there was an ancient ogre who had a physique that was indestructible. When the cultivator reached a certain realm, his body could never be destroyed. Even when he was turned to fine powder, he could still recover.</p>

  <p>Other examples were the Purple Power Body, the Genuine Phoenix and Genuine Dragon bloodlines, and all sorts of legendary beasts bloodlines.</p>

  <p>There were some martial artists that came from these bloodlines and it wasn't uncommon at all. Just like the Dragon Lineage Human of the Genuine Dragon World, almost all of them were descended from the bloodline of the Genuine Dragon. They might be extremely rare in the Lower World, but they were very common in the supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>But the Wrath of the Ocean was different.</p>

  <p>Martial artists with the Wrath of the Ocean were extremely rare and still remained a mystery to all the supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>It was said that every Wrath of the Ocean had different abilities but there was definitely a Law of Causality within each of them. What was even more amazing was that the Law of Causality grew along with the martial artist's growth.</p>

  <p>The weapons that possessed the Law of Causality were also supreme divine weapons. In all the supreme worlds, there were only about less than 3000 supreme divine weapons. Ordinary martial artists wouldn't be able to see any of these weapons in their lifetime. They could only be able to see the names of these weapons on the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>Once a supreme divine weapon was forged, the Law of Causality within it would not be changed, and it was even more impossible for it to grow stronger?</p>

  <p>This was why the leaders were all astounded when they saw the cyan stone on Layla's forehead.</p>

  <p>Once Layla activated the Wrath of the Ocean, her speed only increased.</p>

  <p>17000 miles?</p>

  <p>18000 miles?</p>

  <p>19000 miles?</p>

  <p>20000 miles?</p>

  <p>In just less than five minutes, Layla had already broken Supreme Lord Illusion's record. She hadn't even broken a sweat!</p>

  <p>Within ten minutes, Layla had already surpassed 20000 miles.</p>

  <p>From here on, as Layla continued, she was just creating her own record now.</p>

  <p>The leaders were all watching with excitement. They wanted to know how far Layla could go.</p>

  <p>Yolande pursed her lips and shifted her gaze back to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's achievements were also amazing too. He wasn't by any means slow and he'd already reached the 16000th mile.</p>

  <p>If Layla hadn't been here, Luo Luo Zheng would have been the center of attraction.</p>

  <p>What a pity that Layla was so incredibly talented. When Luo Luo Zheng had reached the 16000th mile, Layla had already reached the 20000th mile by then.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's achievement paled in comparison.</p>

  <p>"Layla's speed is still increasing!" one of the leaders cried.</p>

  <p>At this point, no one was paying any attention to Luo Luo Zheng anymore.</p>

  <p>All of the leaders had their eyes fixed on Layla. As she continued to move forward, the Law Storm became more and more terrifying.</p>

  <p>However, she did not slow down, instead she moved even faster.</p>

  <p>Everyone was astounded. They all collectively gasped in admiration.</p>

  <p>21000 miles?</p>

  <p>22000 miles?</p>

  <p>23000 miles?</p>

  <p>Every time Layla advanced a thousand miles, the leaders of the palaces would exclaim in amazement.</p>

  <p>As for the talents on the side of the square, they also marveled at her achievements. They no longer were in the place to be envious of this kind of woman. In the future, Layla would definitely become someone that they would look up to.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, the old man in cotton clothes said faintly, "Luo Luo Zheng has also passed the eighteen thousand miles mark?"</p>

  <p>The leaders who were staring at Layla finally withdrew their gazes from Layla.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng also broke Supreme Lord Illusion's record?"</p>

  <p>"That's amazing! If Layla wasn't here, Luo Zheng's achievement would still be just as amazing."</p>

  <p>"What a pity. He-he, Luo Luo Zheng is really unlucky. He should have set a new record, but in the end, Layla managed to set a more incredible record before him!"</p>

  <p>The warriors in the square also started to discuss amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>"Who knows who's going to win? Luo Luo Zheng may not be fast, but he's still moving forward. He might even be able to catch up with Layla!"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. Layla has reached the 24000th mile. They're apart by 5000 miles. Once they go deeper into the tower, it'll be more difficult for him to catch up. How could you say he can catch up?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he can't catch up. Everyone, look! Luo Luo Zheng isn't moving!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng stopped and everyone saw it.</p>

  <p>Before this, Luo Luo Zheng had continued to advance at a steady pace. He was neither slow nor fast. It was this rate of speed that allowed him to jump from last place to second place.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stopping meant that he had run into trouble.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that he has reached his limit."</p>

  <p>"That might be the case. The Law Storm is at the level that he can no longer withstand..."</p>

  <p>"Layla has already passed 240000 miles!"</p>

  <p>As Layla constantly broke record after record, everyone couldn't help but wonder: how far could she go?</p>

  <p>However, they all believed that in the end, the record that she would set would be one that wouldn't be surpassed anytime soon by anyone. What she had achieved today was outstanding even more so than the record Supreme Lord Illusion had set before.</p>

  <p>Just as they expected, after Layla broke through the 24000 mark, her speed was still astonishingly fast without any signs of decreasing or stopping.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he had seemingly stopped at the 18000 mark and he wasn't moving as if he was meditating.</p>

  <p>Yolande pursed her lips as she gazed at Luo Luo Zheng. She was a little worried.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning. She had thought highly of Luo Luo Zheng and hoped that he would surpass Layla. But now, Luo Luo Zheng was seemingly stuck in the middle of the Law Storm. 'What is he up to?', she wondered.</p>

  <p>"25000 miles!"</p>

  <p>"26000 miles!"</p>

  <p>"27000 miles? I'm going crazy, this woman's a freak!"</p>

  <p>Layla didn't slow down until she reached the 28000th mile.</p>

  <p>"She finally slowed down?"</p>

  <p>"She has already surpassed Supreme Lord Illusion's record by 10000 miles. That's unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>"Of course she has to slow down. If she continues to advance deeper into the tower, then she'll reach the place where the Law Storm is completely out of control. There's an inner layer of the Law Storm that's impossible to be seen."</p>

  <p>Layla's speed rapidly decreased. After reaching the 28000th mile, she had advanced another 200 miles before she came to a stop.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Layla's figure appeared at the entrance of the Enchanted Barrier Tower with a huge smile on her face.</p>

  <p>While she was proud, she was still approachable. The martial artists from the thirteen palaces looked at her with great admiration as if she were some superior being.</p>

  <p>When Layla returned to the side of the square, she looked up at the Enchanted Barrier Tower and asked, "Where's Luo Luo Zheng? Eh? He's still at the 18000 mark?"</p>
