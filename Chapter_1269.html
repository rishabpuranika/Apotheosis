  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sudden flash which marked Zheng's figure disappearing left traces of curiosity on Aura's face. This was something exotic! "Is that a transmission array?"</p>

  <p>The Eastern Region wasn't exactly marked for its construction and presence of transmission arrays. The only one that had been built within the Cloud Sect was the one that led to the Cloud Road. Even that particular array was now in a dilapidated condition due to its lack of use and maintenance.</p>

  <p>To transfer a person through a transmission array required the use of a supreme life vitality crystal, and even someone as powerful and rich as Kenneth would be reluctant to do that.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Mu Ning saw the transmission array, she felt a little surprised.</p>

  <p>As for Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, their expressions were unfazed.</p>

  <p>Transmission arrays in the Central Region were common, day-to-day objects. Sometimes, even some commonplace merchants who were slightly wealthy enough would choose to use transmission arrays for transporting their goods. Although it was expensive, it was safe and convenient.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't told them where he was leading them, but in Yudie's eyes, even if this small Eastern Region had any secrets to keep, they would be nothing significant. Such a small place simply could not have some secret land.</p>

  <p>But in any case, she was willing to accompany her husband wherever he went.</p>

  <p>As soon as Ning Yudie stepped into the space between the two bamboos, a white light flashed around her and she found herself in a strange place. A look of surprise appeared on her face now.</p>

  <p>"It looks like this transmission array does not have any space channel, and I don't sense the power of the Space Law associated with it. That is unusual," she muttered.</p>

  <p>Behind her, Mu Ning and Mu Ning also passed through the two bamboos and found themselves in the same place.</p>

  <p>The scenery around them was stunning due to the sheer magnitude of its size.</p>

  <p>"These trees are so huge. Is this the world of giants?" Mu Ning looked at the trees that stretched tall as a mountain, her eyes filled with shock.</p>

  <p>At first glance, the surrounding scenery looked very normal indeed. But after careful observation for about a second or two, everything seemed to have been magnified countless times. Even the weeds that were growing below the trees were the size of a common house. It was as if this world was created specifically for giants.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chuckled when he saw their shocked expressions. When he had first arrived at this place, he was only at the nature level. He had been scared by the scenery too, and at that time, there was an unbelievably large white tiger on the other side of the enchanted barrier. Fortunately, the barrier saved his life.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?" Mu Ning asked curiously. In fact, to be perfectly honest, what this place was wasn't important to her at all. But seeing that Luo Zheng seemed to want to surprise them, she decided to play along. This man had her heart, after all.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and Mu Ning were both curious in reality and looking towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled cunningly and replied, "Come with me! I'll show you." He began leading the way towards some unknown destination.</p>

  <p>Hardly had he taken a couple of steps when he suddenly heard Mu Ning and Mu Ning scream. A burst of life vitality rushed out from Yudie's body and she turned around, looking behind her with extreme vigilance. From behind the enchanted barrier appeared dozens of leopards.</p>

  <p>Just like the white tiger Luo Zheng had encountered on his previous trip, these leopards were extremely large and seemed to have been magnified in all aspects. When they opened their mouths to reveal their fangs, the company saw that they were as tall as a human.</p>

  <p>"Wild beasts again?" Zheng's eyes flashed and he assured his companions,</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. They can't enter the enchanted barrier. If they try to even touch the enchanted barrier, they will die."</p>

  <p>He was sizing up the leopards as he spoke. When he had first come here, he was only a nature level warrior and was unable to discern the cultivation level of the white tiger. But now, Luo Zheng had already reached the Life and Death Realm. Those days of blissful ignorance were long gone.</p>

  <p>However, when he tried to size up the leopards, he was instantly left more shocked than he had ever been in his entire life. He could not discern the cultivation level of leopards either.</p>

  <p>In theory, a level ten beast was equivalent to a Life and Death Realm warrior, a level eleven beast was equivalent to a Soul Sea Realm warrior and a level twelve beast was equivalent to a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior. What the classifications said beyond that was still unknown.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current level of cultivation, he could easily sense the cultivation level of a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior. But he still couldn't perceive just how strong the leopards were. This could only mean one thing: the cultivation level of these leopards was still beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the location of this fairy palace and this space were still unfathomable to Luo Zheng. In fact, in retrospect, that was to be expected.</p>

  <p>Even Immortal Mist with all his power was unable to truly control this fairy palace. He only had one more token with the word "thunder" on it than Luo Zheng. So how could Luo Zheng hope to understand the workings of this place?</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>The leopards growled in a guttural voice as they slowly approached the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning and Mu Ning heard Zheng's words, they no longer looked as nervous as before. The two women had no doubts about this man's words. If he was saying that they were safe behind the enchanted barrier, then they were safe for sure.</p>

  <p>As for Ning Yudie, her face still looked a little pale. Although she believed Zheng's words, with her higher cultivation, she could feel the strength of these ferocious beasts. These gigantic leopards actually had a cultivation level that, just like Luo Zheng, she couldn't see through. That was the primary reason she was scared more than the other two women.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression was indifferent. If these leopards were stupid enough to pounce on him, they would end up just like the white tiger three years ago: mere skeletons.</p>

  <p>However, the leopards continued to circle around the enchanted barrier cautiously, as if they were extremely afraid of it. In the end, they only roared helplessly in a furious tone from the other side and did not choose to send themselves to death.</p>

  <p>The intelligence of a beast was not related to its strength. Some beasts' cultivation level was very low, but their intelligence was abnormally high. Some were even smarter than humans. On the contrary, some beasts, whose strength was incomparably high, lacked so much intelligence so as to still be considered like common garden rats.</p>

  <p>These leopards were smarter than the white tiger by a few notches but not smart enough to instantly know they were defeated. Otherwise, they wouldn't have wasted their time in front of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Luo Zheng went up and held Yudie's hand, squeezing it and giving her a reassuring smile.</p>

  <p>Seeing that scene, Mu Ning ran over with a smile. "Hold my hand, too!"</p>

  <p>She took the initiative to grab Zheng's other hand before he could respond.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning, she merely smiled and silently followed behind the three.</p>

  <p>After they traveled some distance, a fairy palace appeared before them.</p>

  <p>The gate to the palace was about ten thousand feet high. This meant that even a mountain-like giant would be able to smoothly pass through it.</p>

  <p>"Whoa! This thing is huge!" Ning Yudie uttered out in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how tall the people who live in this fairy palace are..."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning muttered under her lips.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and took the lead by stepping through the gate. Not long after they walked along the wide plaza, everyone suddenly discovered that the ground began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Footsteps as loud as a huge drum set came their way, and two huge puppets charged out from the inner courtyard.</p>

  <p>Seeing their enormous size and momentum, the three women let out a soft cry.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>However, with a swift movement, Luo Zheng took out a token from his space ring. It was the one inscribed with the word "wind" on it that he had received from Saul when he had left the fairy palace last time. Saul had told him that this token would allow him to control the outer courtyard and enter the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>It was only a token. While it was true that he was the owner of this fairy palace, it didn't grant him any authority over the place.</p>

  <p>The two enormous puppets immediately slowed down the moment Luo Zheng brought the token out of his space ring. Although they were still striding forward, it was obvious that they had no intention of attacking the company now.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>They walked up to Luo Zheng and knelt down on one knee.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly, and then called out to the three of them. Though they were hesitant, the three continued walking into the inner courtyard.</p>

  <p>Actually, at Zheng's current strength level, these puppets couldn't have hurt him at all. However, since he had a token that allowed him to control them, he was obviously not going to waste any time fighting them.</p>

  <p>After entering the inner courtyard, they saw a huge pond in front of them. Inside the pond, countless carps were rolling about.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was still holding the token in his hand, walked straight into the enormous pavilion with the three women. He then began to move the statues in the pavilion and arranged them according to some rule. They managed to simply pass through the pavilion.</p>

  <p>Soon after that, a voice floated their way. "Luo Zheng, my friend. It's been a long time. I've been waiting for you for four years now."</p>

  <p>Not far away from them, stood a middle-aged man wearing a silken robe.</p>

  <p>This was Saul, who had given him the token the last time and who had been separated from Luo Zheng for quite a while now.</p>

  <p>He looked like a puppet too, but a soul was hiding within the puppet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and nodded at his friend. "You are right. It's been a while.</p>

  <p>How's everything going around here?"</p>

  <p>"You tell me! In four years, you managed to jump from a nature level warrior to a Life and Death Realm warrior. Your cultivation speed can be considered quite remarkable," Saul replied. "But it's still not enough!"</p>
