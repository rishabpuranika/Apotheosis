<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The three girls' hearts sank at the sight of what happened to Zheng. However, the stage ruler had an unusual expression of shock on his face.</p>

  <p>Yan gazed at the black mud, but she couldn't find any trace of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Under such devastating attacks, Zheng might have been severely crushed into the mud.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was still stuck in the swamp, her whole body covered in dirt. She struggled to get up from the swamp, but her body was seriously injured that she had difficulty moving.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Out of nowhere, the stage ruler struck out another ten powerful attacks to the area where Zheng was previously standing.</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge witnessed it, confusion appeared on her anxious face.</p>

  <p>She was wondering if it was even necessary to do that since Zheng could not fight back anymore.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, she noticed the restless expression on the stage ruler's face.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the stage ruler unleashed another barrage of attacks. This time, he had struck out at least twenty strong ones. With this, the three girls realized that there must be something wrong.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what exactly was happening, but they were sure that the behavior of the huge lizard was definitely odd.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's strength was limited. After releasing more than thirty rounds of attack using his full strength, he finally got exhausted. He took a step back, and heavy breaths came out from his nostrils.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Yan, and Natalie all fixed their eyes on the location where Zheng was previously standing. A huge pit was created in the area due to the relentless attacks of the stage ruler. The pit was then filled with black mud up to the surface.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the mud on the pit parted as Zheng's figure started to emerge out of the mud, completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Z-Zheng is fine!" Yan exclaimed with a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Natalie was rendered speechless as if she had seen a ghost. 'Is that even possible?!'</p>

  <p>In Natalie's mind, it was already an incredible miracle that Zheng was able to enter the Other Shore with his corporeal body. This time, though she had doubts, she remembered that Yan had always described her brother as omnipotent. For this reason, she was starting to accept that Zheng could really be more amazing than she thought he was.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Zheng had proven himself for being unscathed after receiving about thirty unreserved attacks from the ruler of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Natalie thought that this kind of thing could only happen in dreams, but she completely knew that this was real since her Soul of Light had already entered the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the worry on Feng Ge's face was thoroughly replaced by astonishment and relief.</p>

  <p>"It seems like you're on your limit." Zheng raised his head and gave a faint smile to the stage ruler.</p>

  <p>"You, bastard? How did you do it?" The stage ruler stared at Zheng as he couldn't fully comprehend how Zheng could be completely unharmed with all the attacks that he had thrown at him.</p>

  <p>He was so sure that the body of the young human shouldn't be this strong.</p>

  <p>He thought that there seemed to be something incomprehensible happening to him.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how smart the stage ruler was, he wouldn't be able to grasp something that was way beyond his knowledge. Furthermore, no one had ever been able to see through Zheng's Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that I'll tell you?" Zheng answered. "Besides, if you don't know, then you have already lost."</p>

  <p>As a purified being, Feng Ge didn't possess any theurgy other than the free control of the Great Sanskrit Light, and a strong corporeal body.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng had speculated that this huge lizard might have had the same situation.</p>

  <p>Since the giant lizard became the stage ruler, no one ever dared to treat him this way.</p>

  <p>Previously, all corporeal bodies and Souls of Light that passed through Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, as well as the creatures rooted in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, respected and feared him. Since then, all he received were reverent gazes.</p>

  <p>This was for the first time that he had heard some ruthless mockery since he became the stage ruler. Upon hearing all this, he raised his head and roared viciously.</p>

  <p>White light burst out from under his scales. With the refraction of the scales, the light scattered into seven colors.</p>

  <p>The light traveled a very far distance.</p>

  <p>After handing Yan and Natalie to the stage ruler, the Chief Flag Monkey tried to leave the black swamp and dashed away without stopping.</p>

  <p>As the stage ruler began to roar, the Royal Monkeys had just left the edge of the black swamp.</p>

  <p>At the same moment, they suddenly saw a flash of blinding light.</p>

  <p>"Hey! That's the light of a purified being!" one of the Royal Monkeys yelled.</p>

  <p>"Run! Hurry up! We're going to be vaporized by that thing!" Another Royal Monkey covered his face and ran away without turning back.</p>

  <p>When the Royal Monkeys saw the light, it meant that the light was already being transmitted to where they were.</p>

  <p>Although their location was quite far away from the stage ruler, the Great Sanskrit Light was invincible. It could devour everything in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the situation was getting worse, the Chief Flag Monkey rode on a horse and also ran away at full speed. However, it was kind of too late as the light was quickly devouring the demonic plants and grasses along the way. Eventually, the spreading light caught up to the Royal Monkeys, including the Chief Flag Monkey.</p>

  <p>After the Chief Flag Monkey got promoted as the commander of the Royal Monkey race, he had successfully led the race and made great development.</p>

  <p>Under his command, their race was even ranked first in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. They were able to trample their old nemesis, the one-eyed creatures.</p>

  <p>In the end, no one thought that the commander of the Royal Monkey race as well as his Coldness Monkey Guards would die in such an unexpected way.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mercer and Miller of the Insect Master race were staying farther from the black swamp.</p>

  <p>The brothers originally planned to follow Zheng, putting their lives at stake.</p>

  <p>However, as Zheng and Feng Ge were about to enter the black swamp, Zheng stopped them and told them to simply wait outside.</p>

  <p>"It's that light!"</p>

  <p>"It's coming closer!"</p>

  <p>Fear was written all over their faces. Even the Holy Beetles, who had been completely tamed, were trembling in fear. The creatures in the Dark Region had an instinctive fear towards the Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>However, the two brothers didn't run away. As they looked around, they saw a large pit nearby. The two of them jumped into the pit without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Great Sanskrit Light was indeed powerful, but it still had to erode everything on the surface before it could touch the two, who were hiding inside the deep pit. Eventually, they successfully evaded the looming disaster.</p>

  <p>When the light gradually disappeared, the entire black swamp disappeared as well.</p>

  <p>Along with the swamp, tens of thousands of snakes, insects, and some Other Shore races also vanished.</p>

  <p>As creatures of the Light Region, Zheng and the three girls weren't affected by the Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>Since the whole swamp was eroded, the solid rocks beneath it all showed up.</p>

  <p>Standing on the two huge rocks, Zheng and Feng Ge stared at the stage ruler.</p>

  <p>A pair of light wings grew on the back of the stage ruler. White light twisted into lines that covered his entire body, illuminating the surrounding sky.</p>

  <p>"You don't know much about the purified beings, do you? I will show you what power the son of light could possess!" the stage ruler uttered with a dull smile.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, the twisted lines gathered around his body to his chest, forming a spiral pattern.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A white wave of light shot out from his chest, dashing directly towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack.</p>

  <p>Just as the wave of light was about to hit Zheng, the rocks around his feet already cracked due to the pressure being imposed by it.</p>

  <p>"I see. Your power became much stronger, huh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's pupils slightly contracted as the thunder wings on his back surfaced.</p>

  <p>If Zheng used the thunder wings in the Dark Region beforehand, the internal momentum of the Thunderstorm Godly Way would instantly be devoured by the darkness. However, now that the darkness had been completely expelled by the stage ruler, there was nothing to hinder Zheng from using the thunder wings.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As the thunder wings created a loud sound on Zheng's back, he turned into a flash of lightning and flew sideward. At the same time, he grabbed Feng Ge, who was severely injured, in his arms.</p>
