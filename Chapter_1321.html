  <p>
</p>

  <p>The armored men volunteered to enter the mine to find Luo Luo Zheng but were rejected outright by Master Shen and Master He.</p>

  <p>Why were the two masters so patient?</p>

  <p>This refusal raised a storm of conjecture among the armored men. They mused over what kind of background Luo Luo Zheng had, and some probable reasons as to why these two masters were adamant in waiting for him.</p>

  <p>They enduringly waited from noon until dusk before Luo Luo Zheng finally returned from the mine.</p>

  <p>Freya, on the other hand, chose to leave the mine. After obtaining 100 pieces of life vitality jade, she went directly to her uncle. They only left a communication token for each other.</p>

  <p>In the supreme world, however, it was considered a joke to leave a communication token.</p>

  <p>This token was merely a method of communication in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Its range could only reach as far as sixty to seventy thousand miles. The territory occupied by the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was over ten thousand times larger than this range. So in far too many instances, the communication token was all for naught. Save in the case when Luo Luo Zheng was within sixty to seventy thousand miles away from Freya.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had relieved himself from his mental predicament, he had positively set his goals. He had just entered the Upper World and was still unfamiliar with the place. Accordingly, he had to explore by himself.</p>

  <p>In this stage of exploration, his priority was to awaken Xun. She had been asleep for too long, and currently, there were no signs of her waking up. Luo Luo Zheng had intended to accumulate two hundred life vitality jades and then go to find a treasure that would repair her soul.</p>

  <p>Luck was on his side today as he encountered the Nine-head Snake again. Aside from taking away seven pieces of life vitality jade from the snake, Luo Luo Zheng had also uncovered a secret. He figured out that if he wanted to find life vitality jade, he would have to follow those vicious beasts that were fond of spending their days in the mine and absorbing the vitality of heaven and earth from the life vitality jade.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that these beasts were too powerful, Luo Luo Zheng seriously wanted to leave imprints on their bodies, and then he wouldn't have to search for them for a long time every time.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Luo Zheng returned to the gathering place, he sensed that there was something wrong.</p>

  <p>As his gaze swiftly swept across the place, his brows were scrunched together.</p>

  <p>"These two men are quite powerful."</p>

  <p>Up till now, Luo Luo Zheng had seen many unimaginably strong people.</p>

  <p>Take the master that he had acknowledged in the Immortal Mansion as an example. It was only a shadow left behind by his master, so estimating his true strength using that shadow was not easy. He only knew that his master was a figure that surpassed the universe.</p>

  <p>Next was the young man who had taken his sister away in the Ethereal Spirit Sect. That fellow's strength was also hard to imagine. With Luo Zheng's current knowledge, he was still unfit to determine who was stronger between that man and his master.</p>

  <p>Then it was the old Celestial Position man that he and Ning Yudie met during the wedding. According to Luo Zheng's conjecture, this old man might be at the world lord level.</p>

  <p>As for the two men in front of him, they gave Luo Luo Zheng a distinct impression.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this, they ought to be below the world lord level.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of provoking them no matter who they were. Right after he landed, he subsequently planned to find the armored men to record the life vitality jades that he handed in today. But seeing the armored men standing in a row and no one seemed to have come to him, he was slightly confused. He had no idea whom to give the life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Master He steadily walked over to him and cracked a smile. "You're  Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Judging by his words, Luo Luo Zheng immediately knew that it was most likely that they came for him.</p>

  <p>He couldn't avoid the meeting anyway, so he nodded and replied, "Yes, I am  Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Master He blurted, "Congratulations! You have just concluded your term of service. And finally, you have become a member of our Spiritual Force Sacred Place!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the armored men looked at each other in utter dismay. The leader of the armored men had already reminded the two masters that Luo Luo Zheng was planning on becoming an independent warrior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow creased. He then smiled and replied, "Sir, is there a mistake?</p>

  <p>I do not intend to join the Spiritual Force Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>"This isn't up to you, but it's an order from Holy City. We'll directly lead you into Holy City," Master Shen joined in.</p>

  <p>When they heard Master Shen's remarks, all of the armored men' jaws dropped.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Force Sacred Place was such an enormous place. Most of the warriors who joined the Spiritual Force Sacred Place could only do some jobs and take up some positions in its 36, 000 cities.</p>

  <p>For example, although the armored men had reached the Soul Sea Realm and they were not weak in the Upper World, being city lords was seen as a good job there.</p>

  <p>Truly the most outstanding warriors had set their goals at the thirty-six halls.</p>

  <p>It would be undoubtedly an unrivaled honor if they were able to join these thirty-six halls.</p>

  <p>But the predicament of joining these halls was greatly unimaginable. For the vast majority of warriors, this was a dream that was simply out of their reach.</p>

  <p>The thirty-six halls, to be exact, were not the core of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. It was Holy City instead.</p>

  <p>Holy City was considered with paramount importance in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. It was also something that the latter used to its own advantage to compete with the other two sacred places in the Spirit Reading World.</p>

  <p>In Holy City, talent bore more prominence than cultivation. As long as warriors possessed talent, promoting their cultivation to the Soul Sea Realm would be extremely simple for Holy City.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the warriors that were chosen to enter Holy City were all below the Soul Sea Realm. Holy City would not accept warriors that were above the Soul Sea Realm unless they were especially outstanding.</p>

  <p>There was only one reason for this, and that was the tribulations of those at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Once warriors broke through to the Life and Death Realm, they would be going through Small Heavenly Tribulations next.</p>

  <p>Most normal warriors would only have five or six Small Heavenly Tribulations before they reached the Soul Sea Realm. Although they could enter the Soul Sea Realm ahead of time, that was not a good thing.</p>

  <p>The fewer Heavenly Tribulations Life and Death Realm warriors experienced, the less potential they would have in the future.</p>

  <p>Almost all warriors who had ascended to the Upper World were consistently eager to leap forward to the Soul Sea Realm. It must be admitted that predominantly, such warriors held so much power, but sadly, they would not be able to make a difference in the future.</p>

  <p>The warriors that could enter Holy City would often have to go through eight or even nine Small Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>As a result, there was a saying in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>And that was, if one could go through nine Small Heavenly Tribulations, there would be a good chance of becoming a world lord.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no slightest notion of these things. Previously, however, he had ingested the Tribulation Flower in the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>According to the cyan dragon, the flower only existed in the Lower World. After he unintentionally swallowed it, he would surely meet nine Small Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>At this point, the armored men stood dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Previously, they thought that Luo Luo Zheng had been selected by the two masters.</p>

  <p>And he had the qualifications to join the thirty-six halls. Unexpectedly, the two masters would take him directly to Holy City.</p>

  <p>The armored men surnamed Chen and Huang instantaneously felt a lingering fear in their hearts as soon as the realization hit them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the two of them had warned Riyad in time to not cause any trouble for Luo Luo Zheng. If they hadn't stopped Riyad at that time, the two of them probably wouldn't have been able to survive if something bad had happened to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Trembling with fear, the two of them made up their minds that they couldn't let Riyad mess around. Although they had obtained quite a few benefits from him, they would be the ones to suffer if he provoked some extraordinary warriors who had ascended there.</p>

  <p>Under the envious gaze of the armored men, Luo Luo Zheng asked doubtfully, "Holy City? What place is it?"</p>

  <p>The armored men were surprised at his question. However, after some thought, they realized that Luo Luo Zheng was from the Lower World, so it was normal that he had no idea of Holy City.</p>

  <p>Master He said, "It is the core of our Spiritual Force Sacred Place. If the Spiritual Force Sacred Place is considered a great sacred place, then Holy City is its sacred place."</p>

  <p>This metaphor was very appropriate, and Luo Luo Zheng understood immediately.</p>

  <p>He asked, "What if I refuse?"</p>

  <p>Hearing that Luo Luo Zheng wanted to refuse, the armored men were heartbroken.</p>

  <p>As long as they could join Holy City, they would give up everything except their own lives.</p>

  <p>The two hall leaders did not reveal any expression of surprise. After all, they were people who had seen a lot of things. They were clear that there were a lot of grade 10 sacred places in the world, and some peerless talents might not want to join the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Master He countered, "With your current strength, you don't have the qualifications to refuse. For your understanding, we are asked to take you to Holy City."</p>

  <p>Since he had already said so, Luo Luo Zheng had nothing else to say. They were all intelligent people, and with his current strength, there was no room for resistance.</p>
