  <p>
</p>

  <p>Light streamed out from the window of the cabin.</p>

  <p>However, despite that the cabin was illuminated by the candlelight, one couldn't see anything through the window with just their naked eyes.</p>

  <p>As the chain bridge came down from the opposite side of the soul pillars, the opportunity of exploring the secret in the cabin that remained unknown for over a thousand chaotic eras finally presented itself.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, Luo Zheng," the Primeval Lord of Heaven coaxed. "Perhaps you have obtained a chance to face them."</p>

  <p>Staring at the chain bridge before him, Luo Zheng hesitated.</p>

  <p>To be honest, the only reason why he was exploring the Soul City was to reach the Holy Soul Realm. Now that he had achieved his goal, he had a chance to turn back.</p>

  <p>Yet, something tugged at him from the back of his mind. He carried the book of the human race, after all. He was the only hope of the human race.</p>

  <p>In a sense, he didn't have the right to give up the opportunity to explore the secret.</p>

  <p>"Who are 'they'?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The civilization that built the Soul City," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat. "Is this the civilization that never existed?"</p>

  <p>"Never existed? Who told you that?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his eyebrow slightly, feeling a bit stunned.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess," Luo Zheng replied. "Actually, to be precise, the avatar of her."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled faintly. "Snake Goddess thought too highly of herself. The Soul City, the Land of Bone Tribulation, and the Eternal Scroll Painting are the proofs of the existence of the Instant Civilization. No matter how powerful the Element Spirit race is, it's impossible for them to create these things. In fact, they would try every way to destroy them first if they have the chance!"</p>

  <p>If the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were completely destroyed, no one else would be able to enter the Eternal Realm. As the forerunners, the Element Spirit race could have prevented others from becoming stronger than them by simply destroying the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation. Obviously, they had every reason wanting to destroy them.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they hadn't succeeded. Despite trying more than once, they couldn't seem to completely destroy them. Helplessly, they had no choice but to watch as the Other Shore creatures and the Souls of Light came and went through the Soul City freely.</p>

  <p>"Then... Are you saying there are remnants of the Instant Civilization inside that house?" Luo Zheng's interest was finally piqued.</p>

  <p>"We will only know after you enter and have a look," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Without further hesitation, he took a step forward--right onto the chain bridge.</p>

  <p>Because his Soul of Light had changed, the way he perceived the world felt different. This new Colorless Soul felt like a newborn beast that had just emerged from its shell. Whenever it touched anything, it felt novel and soft.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng stepped on the chain bridge, something suddenly rushed over from the entrance of the Soul City.</p>

  <p>It was clear as crystal, as though it were made of sculpted ice. It seemed to have a form, but Luo Zheng couldn't tell for sure as it kept morphing into different shapes as it rushed over. At this moment, it had turned into a pair of wings, flying towards the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>It was astonishingly fast. Before Luo Zheng even had the time to blink, it had stepped onto the bridge.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched it head straight towards the building on the other side of the bridge. He noticed that when it had rushed for a certain distance, dots of orange light appeared on the chain bridge.</p>

  <p>One by one, the dots of light stuck to the surface of its crystal clear body.</p>

  <p>The figure started to struggle, as though each orange dot was a hand that pulled at it.</p>

  <p>The crystal clear thing kept trying to shrug off the orange dots of light, but soon, it could barely even budge.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the icy body melted into a pool of blue liquid that flowed along the chain bridge.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Luo Zheng finally asked, as he watched the pool of blue liquid trickle down the sides of the bridge.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven sneered. "It is a Chill Ice Slave."</p>

  <p>"It's from the Element Spirit race?" Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are stronger than the Moon Fire Slaves."</p>

  <p>In the past, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had slain countless Moon Fire Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves-- however, he had struggled slightly more with the latter.</p>

  <p>The bodies of the Chill Ice Slaves were ever-changing. Additionally, they were much stronger than the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>The Soul City was important. Naturally, the Element Spirit race kept a close eye on it. After Luo Zheng had caused all the strange things to happen, the Element Spirit race was immediately alerted.</p>

  <p>The instant the Element Spirit race found out the chain bridge had been put down, they wanted to seize the opportunity to explore the secret. They too wanted to know what was within the cabin.</p>

  <p>However, they had failed in their efforts.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gingerly took another step forward, then another, and another. After a few more steps, the dots of orange light appeared once more.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng could see the light dots up close, he noticed they were irregularly shaped. Some were circular and some were in diamond shape, looking like orange petals floating in the air.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng saw these light dots approaching him, he furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>Just now, the Chill Ice Slave was killed by the orange light dots. Naturally, he didn't want to experience the same fate.</p>

  <p>But these orange light dots were too densely packed together, there was no possible way Luo Zheng could pass through safely.</p>

  <p>"Da..."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng hesitated, an orange petal landed gently on his arm. Luo Zheng jerked back by instinct, but the petal had already latched onto his arm.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the orange petal didn't hurt. In fact, it seemed his skin just absorbed it. After touching the golden meridians in his arm, the orange petal merged into his body and became a part of his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Luo Zheng felt a trace of warmth emanating from his arm, specifically the spot where the petal landed.</p>

  <p>"These...things won't hurt me?" Luo Zheng asked, thoroughly perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Of course." The Primeval Lord of Heaven chuckled softly. "After all, you got nine Holy Soul Imprints and activated this chain bridge. How could the Instant civilization make the mistake of hurting you?"</p>

  <p>His eyes twinkled. In the Primeval Lord of Heaven's mind, the Instant Civilization was the chief designer of this entire world.</p>

  <p>Time, space, truth, Divine Dao, and any laws--these were all designed by the Instant Civilization, a magical race that never made mistakes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. Then, he proceeded to cross the chain bridge with ease.</p>

  <p>The orange petals of light did no harm to Luo Zheng. On the contrary, they nourished his soul like a warm embrace. As Luo Zheng walked through the dense cloud of orange petals, he raised his arms to let his Soul of Light absorb them.</p>

  <p>The chain bridge was only a few thousand feet long. It wasn't long before Luo Zheng arrived at the end of the bridge. Taking a deep breath, he stepped off the bridge and onto the path that led to the cabin with a spire.</p>

  <p>It was only then he realized that the buildings in the Soul City were built quite strangely. The entrances were quite narrow. If the creatures of the Instant Civilization had forms, they must've been very thin...</p>

  <p>However, after a few more steps, the path gradually widened.</p>

  <p>Carvings decorated the sides of the steps, but they were of neither beasts nor scenery. The carvings were quite abstract, showing only shapes from squares to circles to triangles, and so on.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be rich notes around these shapes. Upon a closer look, Luo Zheng realized these were fist-sized Sanskrit words that seemed to be explaining the connection between these shapes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng surveyed his surroundings. However, he couldn't decipher the Sanskrit words. He was about to keep moving forward when the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, wait for a moment. I want to study these intricate carvings..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven was extremely interested in these carvings and Sanskrit words.</p>
