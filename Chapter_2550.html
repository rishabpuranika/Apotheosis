<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Romeo lost himself in his thoughts, a small black dot suddenly flew in front of him.</p>

  <p>The black dot grew bigger as it approached him. When it got closer, it turned into a giant over ten thousand feet in height.</p>

  <p>This giant's Wild God Power was incomparably pure, and his body shone with a faint, golden light.</p>

  <p>"The Wild Body of the Yellow Emperor."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Romeo increased his guard. He held the bamboo sword in one hand and slightly leaned forward, prepared to attack at any time.</p>

  <p>A layer of light golden color would wash over the bodies of the Wild Gods from the Yellow Emperor race when their blood was activated.</p>

  <p>Thus, Romeo thought that the one who arrived must have the blood of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>"You've killed eight Wild Gods in an instant. You really are worthy of your reputation as a new talent of the Nine Li race." The man from the Yellow Emperor race laughed.</p>

  <p>"If you want to challenge me, so be it. Why did you send your useless followers to fight me?" Romeo snorted.</p>

  <p>The man's lips curved up into a grin. "I just wanted you to warm up.</p>

  <p>Since I let you in, of course I won't let you leave the Immemorial Wilderness!" "What do you mean?" Romeo asked as his face darkened.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race had been fighting fiercely in the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, most of those who had died were the outsiders who came to collect wild bones. It didn't matter if they received the Admission Tokens of the Nine Li race or the Yellow Emperor race, because the core disciples of the two races eventually killed them as they were just collateral damage from the core disciples' cultivation.</p>

  <p>The core disciples of the two races, however, rarely fought in real fights.</p>

  <p>They even deliberately avoided too many conflicts.</p>

  <p>After all, most of the core disciples were cultivated by consuming a great amount of blood wild bones. The death of any core disciple would bring a great loss.</p>

  <p>Just then, Romeo had a bad feeling about the man's words.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the man thought that Romeo wouldn't be able to live anymore. "It's very simple. We've been fighting for the Sky South Bone Tower so long.</p>

  <p>It's time for our race to settle in," he said with a chuckle. "You think you can settle in if you kill me? It won't be that simple," Romeo sneered.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be denied that the competition in their world was too fierce.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the powerhouses of all the clans were present in the List of Blood Lineage.</p>

  <p>Ranked first place was the Snake Goddess race, followed by the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race, respectively. Aside from those three, there were other large races as well.</p>

  <p>When shepherds quarreled, the wolf had a winning game, as the saying went. If the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race really fought over the Sky South Bone Tower, the other races would most likely take advantage of the opportunity, and that was the last thing the two races wanted to happen.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they really couldn't go all out to fight over the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>Besides, even if the Yellow Emperor race killed Romeo, they still wouldn't be able to settle in the Sky South Bone Tower either.</p>

  <p>"Of course we can.</p>

  <p>As long as we kill a few of the core disciples from the younger generation of your race, we will be able to win back the Sky South Bone Tower. Hahaha..." the man said and laughed. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Romeo growled.</p>

  <p>"Although you are a disciple of the Nine Li race, I'm afraid you don't know that our races have made a bet. Mid-rank Wild Gods will fight at the foot of the Sky South Bone Tower, and the winners will be able to settle in the tower. It's said that each race can dispatch five people to the match. Among the younger generation of your race, Chandler is ranked second, and Farhann is ranked fourth--but unfortunately, both of them are dead and can't participate in the match. You are ranked third, but you'd probably die too. Ha-ha!" The man cackled.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, two more black dots approached them as the man laughed wildly.</p>

  <p>The two black dots quickly increased in size and turned into two Wild Gods who were over ten thousand feet tall. Their bodies also sparkled with a golden light, which meant that they were also from Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Now, Romeo couldn't help but be surprised at the man's words. He glared at him and asked, "Did you kill Farhann and Chandler?"</p>

  <p>The most talented people from the younger generation of the Nine Li race were Elsa, Chandler, Romeo, Farhann, and Killian.</p>

  <p>Chandler and Romeo were the closest ones among them, and they often trained in the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>If what the man had said was true, then he really did kill Chandler. That was something that Romeo had never expected.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he understood what the man meant. As soon as the two races had made a bet, the Yellow Emperor race quickly killed the two out of the top five young warriors of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>In that case, the Yellow Emperor race had gained the initiative. Of course, the fewer young talents the Nine Li race had, the Yellow Emperor race's chances of victory were greater.</p>

  <p>Chandler and Farhann were dead, and now they targeted Romeo.</p>

  <p>"How evil!" Romeo blurted out, and as soon as he realized that fact, the only thought in his mind was to escape.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>He immediately turned around and flew towards the other side of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>The man just snickered and said, "Since you're here, there's no way that I'll let you run away."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the three men from the Yellow Emperor race rushed to chase Romeo.</p>

  <p>Somewhere far away, Zheng was oblivious to what was happening in that area of Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>He just wholeheartedly continued to dig the wild bones.</p>

  <p>After a few hours, he had accumulated more than 30, 000 wild bones.</p>

  <p>If he worked with such efficiency and went to the Immemorial Wilderness a few times a month, he could have several hundred thousand wild bones.</p>

  <p>No wonder these people were willing to take the risk to enter this place.</p>

  <p>The efficiency of collecting wild bones in this way was countless times higher. Just by absorbing more than 30, 000 wild bones alone would be able to increase his body to a thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>What if he came to collect wild bones for a month?</p>

  <p>When Zheng released his spiritual sense again, he felt something different and his heart beat slightly faster.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>He had clearly sensed that a wild bone underneath the ground gave off a special kind of power.</p>

  <p>"It's a blood wild bone!"</p>

  <p>He had seen a blood wild bone before and knew that the auras of different blood wild bones were different.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>He wasted no time and his body began to dig down in a flash.</p>

  <p>The blood wild bone wasn't buried too deep. It was only about twenty feet underground.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before he was twenty feet deep. He carefully removed the skeletons and pulled out a piece of brown wild bone.</p>

  <p>"The aura of this wild bone..."</p>

  <p>The moment he touched it, he was hit with something familiar.</p>

  <p>"Does it have Chiyou's blood?" he muttered. The mere thought of it quickly made him excited.</p>

  <p>He had Chiyou's blood, but there were too few blood wild bones in the world. He didn't get the second one after he dug out one blood wild bone, let alone the one with Chiyou's blood.</p>

  <p>Despite being thrilled for words, he gently moved his hand along the surface of the wild bone and used his spiritual sense to draw out a wisp of the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>In turn, the wisp of the brown Wild God Power quietly transformed into the shape of three heads and six arms.</p>
