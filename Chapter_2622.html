<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The green block looked quite ordinary, nothing special.</p>

  <p>However, there was a hint of excitement in the eyes of Timotheus and the others.</p>

  <p>"Is this the inheritance from the Chaos Ancient God?" asked Timotheus with his greedy eyes shining.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly and asked, "Did you know about it, Master Timotheus?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded and said, "I already guessed it when you went through the Body Tribulations last time, but I didn't think you would be able to obtain the inheritance in such a short period of time. It's remarkable."</p>

  <p>Timotheus didn't continue. Even Ramzi and his companions tried their best to suppress their curiosity.</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's secret, and they were being rude by prying.</p>

  <p>The exiles had no idea about the Chaos Ancient God's purpose, but it was not a bad thing for the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was a blessing in their eyes.</p>

  <p>After Timotheus and the others left, Zheng asked for a quiet place to continue his research on that energy.</p>

  <p>"You're very talented to be able to grasp a Truth Crystal in just half a month," No. 9527 commented. "But don't get too excited yet. A complete truth is like a towering tree, and what you have mastered is only the smallest root. You can't display its power yet."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. Although the square Truth Crystal was indeed mysterious, it was not so powerful as Zheng's own energy to fuse the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, I will teach you how to use the Truth Crystal," No. 9527 added.</p>

  <p>The Truth Crystal was the bloodline theurgy of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>After he observed the Godly Ways Great Unity, he had comprehended his truth himself, and then integrated it into his bloodline.</p>

  <p>Using this Truth Crystal, or the bloodline theurgy, was very important.</p>

  <p>Next, Zheng would continue to cultivate tirelessly.</p>

  <p>The time for the arrival of the Light of Adjudication was drawing near.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the bone tower grew intense. When the Light of Adjudication finally came, all the Wild Gods in the world, except the major races inside the bone towers, would be obliterated.</p>

  <p>According to past experience, most of the Wild Gods would experience the Light of Adjudication without even knowing.</p>

  <p>They would only have a few seconds left by the time they realized that the Light of Adjudication had arrived. Then they would see themselves, their peers, even their brothers and sisters turn into dust in the dazzling light. They would even see themselves turn into dust and disappear from this world.</p>

  <p>Some of the Wild Gods who knew the truth tried desperately to dash into the bone towers as fast as they could. Generally speaking, the Wild Gods would never reveal the news of the Light of Adjudication arriving because that meant having one more opponent to compete with for entering the bone tower. It significantly diminished their chances. So none of the Wild Gods were foolish enough to divulge this information.</p>

  <p>However, something changed not long before the arrival of the Light of Adjudication this time.</p>

  <p>A nasty piece of gossip suddenly began to spread everywhere crazily, especially in those remote cities. As it was a very juicy and shocking piece of information, it spread rapidly.</p>

  <p>Before the Light of Adjudication had fallen on this world, the members of the various big races had managed to return to the bone towers, and they didn't notice it at the very beginning.</p>

  <p>The gossip spread across all the cities like wildfire.</p>

  <p>All the Wild Gods knew of the existence of the Light of Adjudication, as well as the fate of those being eliminated, and the fact that the bone towers was their shelter. Everyone was in a state of panic.</p>

  <p>In the Towering City, hundreds of thousands of Wild Gods had gathered close to the Snake Goddess race's Torrent Bone Tower. The Wild Gods were seething and filled with righteous indignation.</p>

  <p>A sturdy middle-aged man looked down at the people on the city wall and shouted, "The big races are hiding in the bone towers to seek refuge, and so is our city lord. Only we 'lowly people' are waiting for death here.</p>

  <p>Why should we? Who wants to wait for death?"</p>

  <p>"Not me!"</p>

  <p>"Me neither!"</p>

  <p>"No one wants to wait for death!"</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of Wild Gods answered in an enraged chorus.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man continued, "But our strength is far inferior to that of the people of the Snake Goddess race. If we attack the bone tower, we will surely be killed. But in the end, a small number of people will be able to break into the bone tower, so that a few of us can survive! Will you take a chance?"</p>

  <p>"We will die anyway. Why don't we give it a try?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we're bound to die if we stay here! If we get lucky and are able to break through to the bone tower, we might have a chance to save our lives!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The only thought that occupied the minds of the Wild Gods right now was survival. They certainly knew that it was not easy to deal with the large race in the bone tower.</p>

  <p>However, once they knew that they would definitely die, all of their scruples and fears had vanished. Now their survival instincts had kicked in. When they were not even afraid of death, how could they be afraid of the big races?</p>

  <p>"Then what are you waiting for?" the middle-aged man roared again.</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>"Force your way into the Torrent Bone Tower and make them take us in!"</p>

  <p>"I'm going in even if I have to kill!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of Wild Gods rushed toward the bone tower in a mad frenzy.</p>

  <p>As the middle-aged man gazed at the tide of people rushing to the Torrent Bone Tower in the distance, a smug smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He leaned against the wall, and muttered, "According to our agreement, your Yellow Emperor race has to take me in."</p>

  <p>Not far away, in the darkness of the city wall, a thin young man strolled outside. He was none other than Roy, a member of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Roy was entrusted with the duty of spreading the news of the Light of Adjudication in the Towering City.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he'd better not show up. So he had found this middle-aged man who had a high reputation in the city.</p>

  <p>Roy had promised this middle-aged man that he would be able to join the Yellow Emperor race and seek refuge in their bone tower if he instigated the Wild Gods to charge into the Torrent Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>His strategy had been a success.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, our Yellow Emperor race's bone tower will not be able to contain so many people," Roy said with an evil grin.</p>

  <p>The man's face darkened. He stared at Roy and snapped, "But you promised me!"</p>

  <p>"So what?" Roy said lightly, "You can also storm into the Torrent Bone Tower with them. Maybe you'll have a chance to live!"</p>

  <p>"You, you�traitor! I'll fight it out with you!"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man flew into a rage and began to activate the Wild God Power within his body to fight his backstabbing opponent.</p>

  <p>But before he could begin to swell up, Roy had already turned into a streak of light and flown past him.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man's eyes widened in surprise and his body stiffened.</p>

  <p>At the same time, blood gushed out from Roy's fingertips.</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man fell to the ground, and Roy gently shook his right hand to clean off the blood stains on it. He looked at the middle-aged man's corpse and said, "Why did you force me to do that? As a lowly person in the wilderness, you should accept your death by the Light of Adjudication."</p>

  <p>Then, Roy disappeared into the darkness again.</p>

  <p>Such things happened often in all big cities.</p>

  <p>All the cities and the Wild Gods within the territory of the Snake Goddess race were encouraged by the Yellow Emperor race. For the first time, ten million Wild Gods rushed towards the Torrent Bone Tower.</p>
