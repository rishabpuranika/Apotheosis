  <p>
</p>

  <p>These words made Zheng rather perplexed.</p>

  <p>He never had any doubt about his background and origin— the blood running in his veins was undoubtedly inherited from his parents.</p>

  <p>Everything in Soul City was related to souls. One's bloodline completely didn't matter here.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Zheng heard what the Starry Roc-fish said, the first thought that appeared in his mind was that it had mistaken him for someone else.</p>

  <p>"Return? You mean this isn't my first time to the Soul City?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish blinked and made a slight nod.</p>

  <p>"Have I come here before?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish nodded again.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?" Zheng became more and more bewildered.</p>

  <p>"You're the only one who can get nine Holy Soul Imprints; nobody else can," the Starry Roc-fish said concisely.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what the Starry Roc-fish said, the Primeval Lord of Heaven heaved a deep sigh and said, "I see."</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng asked in his mind.</p>

  <p>"I've told you before that I obtained seven Holy Soul Imprints back then and that it is already an extremely rare occurrence on the Other Shore, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked back.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you also said that someone else managed to obtain eight Holy Soul Imprints," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"That person was my junior fellow disciple. His talent has always been greater than mine," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said regretfully, "but after he obtained eight Holy Soul Imprints, he was always unhappy. He felt that with his talent, he ought to be able to obtain the ninth Holy Soul Imprint successfully. Moreover, his soul pillar had grown to 1, 710 feet tall.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, when he was about to succeed, he was suddenly attacked by an unknown force and fell down."</p>

  <p>The junior fellow disciple of the Primeval Lord of Heaven was the Grandmaster of Heaven. At that time, he had yet to have a falling-out with the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and they still treated each other like brothers.</p>

  <p>"In other words, the ninth imprint..." Zheng said hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to be obtained by anyone else but you," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged and smiled helplessly. "Apparently, I have to get acquainted with myself again..."</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish swung its tail from side to side repeatedly, stuck its horn out, and started to sway around at the mouth of the golden pot. Before long, a wisp of flame suddenly burst at the golden pot's mouth, and the gate of Soul City was once again opened.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish had to do the same task day after day. Even though Zheng's arrival was a very special event, it didn't really pique its interest.</p>

  <p>It continued to swing its tail, intending to return to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute." Zheng stepped forward and stopped the Starry Roc-fish. He still had a lot of unanswered questions weighing on his mind— how could he let it go that easily? "Since you said I had been in the city before, you must know me. Tell me, who am I? And who's waiting for me?"</p>

  <p>"The one waiting for you is my master, and you're the one my master's waiting for."</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish then continued to swing its tail, propelling its body forward and passing through Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Its body was neither soul nor corporeal form, so Zheng simply could do nothing to stop it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The moment the Starry Roc-fish drilled into the wall, it turned into a mural that glittered with dots of lights.</p>

  <p>"Hey!</p>

  <p>So you won't move anymore?</p>

  <p>That isn't an answer at all. You should at least explain it clearly!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted at the wall. Just as he prepared himself to wait for another 132 hours, the Starry Roc-fish suddenly stuck its head out and came out of the wall again. It then swept its head along the wall gently.</p>

  <p>The light dots on the wall continued to converge. In a short while, they already shaped some sort of a small key.</p>

  <p>In the next second, the key popped out of the wall and fell to the ground with crisp jingles.</p>

  <p>"Ding, Ding, Ding..."</p>

  <p>"I'm just a spirit servant that's guarding the Soul City on my master's behalf.</p>

  <p>You should go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. This key should help you in finding my master..." Upon saying that, the Starry Roc-fish sank back into the wall and didn't come out again.</p>

  <p>Zheng picked up the key and examined it for a while.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about this key. At least from its appearance, it just looked like an ordinary key.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled bitterly and said, "There are so many locks in this world, but you just gave me a key. God knows for which lock this key is..."</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be difficult to find the lock," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You mean..."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven continued, "There are indeed many locks in this world, but there aren't many in Stage Thirty-three!"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was one of the very few people who had set foot in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, so he naturally knew the Three Purities Stage well. Just now, he had even come up with a few guesses regarding this matter, so Zheng should go to the Three Purities Stage to verify his guesses.</p>

  <p>With a shrug, Zheng stretched out his hand. A blue square of light appeared out of thin air and started to flicker. Without further ado, Zheng threw the key into it.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterward, Zheng left the cabin. When he arrived at the soul pillars, many of the Souls of Light present quietly directed their gazes at him. After all, he now looked completely different from them.</p>

  <p>The aura he emitted even scared them.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng passed by the area where the soul pillars were, he heard Elvinia's call.</p>

  <p>Elvinia already entered the city the moment the gate opened, but instead of climbing back up the soul pillar, she stood waiting next to it in silence.</p>

  <p>After seeing that Zheng was safe and sound, she finally heaved a relieved sigh.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, I didn't inform you in advance when I closed the gate to the Soul City..." Zheng said apologetically.</p>

  <p>In any case, Elvinia must've been worried about him for a long time.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Elvinia smiled and said, "I've gone to the Flow Sword Sect to see you and found you were fine, but my mother also asked me to send you a message. The Snake Goddess has come to our Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>She wants to see you."</p>

  <p>Although the Oneness Sky Palace was temporarily peaceful, a large number of people were still pessimistic about the future.</p>

  <p>After all, it was very dangerous for a super force to have no Eternal Warrior watching over it.</p>

  <p>Although the Snake Goddess of the Pear Hill came to the Oneness Sky Palace only for a visit, her presence undoubtedly made many people feel much more relieved.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were the most outstanding among the Eternal Warriors after all.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I see." Zheng looked at Elvinia and said, "Come on! You should do your best too!"</p>

  <p>Elvinia wanted to step into Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore with Zheng, but Zheng had already passed the trial in Soul City in one try. She, on the other hand, might have to spend a while stuck in here.</p>

  <p>Even though Elvinia was talented, it wouldn't be easy for her to pass through the Soul City in a short time.</p>

  <p>She naturally understood this clearly.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Elvinia nodded and then leaped onto the soul pillar.</p>

  <p>Right after Zheng stepped out of the gate of Soul City, he chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune under his breath and left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After a period of reconstruction, the originally destroyed Phoenix Palace was almost completely reconstructed.</p>

  <p>However, the current Phoenix Palace was only good in terms of its external appearance. The powerful arrays protecting it, such as the Primitive Illusion and the Three-Element Sword Array, had already been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden, Winchell, Athemar, and other important officials of the Oneness Sky Palace, were all waiting in the Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess both sat on the seats of honor in the Supreme Dragon Hall. They were here naturally to wait for Zheng.</p>
