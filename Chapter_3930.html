  <p>
</p>

  <p>More than half of Gerald's bright-colored tail needle was impaled into the Sanskrit Light Body of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The tail needle was about three hundred thousand feet long, and about two-thirds of the total length was drilled deep into the body.</p>

  <p>Ideally, it was already enough to break the Sanskrit Light Body.</p>

  <p>"Nice work, Gerald!"</p>

  <p>"There's no way he could resist the Poison of Decomposition!"</p>

  <p>"Finish him!"</p>

  <p>Everyone yelled and was full of expectations.</p>

  <p>Technically, the Poison of Decomposition was not a poison, but a kind of energy that could destroy things at a molecular level. Supposedly, no one had a good way to withstand it.</p>

  <p>Just when everyone thought that they had finally succeeded, the expression on Gerald's face gradually changed. "What is this? There is no— "</p>

  <p>"Physical body?" the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered as he finished Gerald's sentence.</p>

  <p>Everyone clearly witnessed how Gerald's needle pierced into the Sanskrit Light Body of the Grandmaster of Heaven. However, the body was empty.</p>

  <p>It turned out that it was not a real physical body.</p>

  <p>"So what? That doesn't matter!" Gerald retorted, trying to still sound confident.</p>

  <p>The Poison of Decomposition was supposed to destroy everything, including energies and souls. That was why Gerald was still confident that they could take the Grandmaster of Heaven down.</p>

  <p>Soon, a black mass leaked at the place where the needle stabbed the body.</p>

  <p>Like a thick dripping ink, it began to diffuse but soon stopped.</p>

  <p>In just a matter of seconds, the all-conquering Poison of Decomposition was subdued and lost its effect.</p>

  <p>"Are you done with your childish games?!" the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Then, at his bidding, his long sword emerged, shrouded in pure bright lights.</p>

  <p>He waved his sword and a white sword arc instantly appeared in the void.</p>

  <p>The sword arc was lashing in the air at such an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Gerald quickly pulled his tail and retrieved it from the body of the Grandmaster of Heaven. However, there was not enough time.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>Gerald's tail was slashed, and a stream of green blood gushed out immediately.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven raised his sword and aimed at Gerald again.</p>

  <p>The sharp lights coming from it seemed to be able to illuminate the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>This time, as the Grandmaster of Heaven threw his second strike, Gerald's reaction was quicker. He was able to use the Grand Teleportation in order to avoid the incoming attack.</p>

  <p>"Humph! What an annoying insect!"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was going all out. He intended to do anything and release everything in his arsenal just to bring down all his opponents.</p>

  <p>With that, he prepared his next set of attacks.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the space around him solidified. He dragged the white shadows of light and instantly appeared in front of Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"Die! Weaklings!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi was caught off guard. The white arc of light quickly rushed towards his head.</p>

  <p>"So fast! I won't make it!"</p>

  <p>His body froze for a few seconds before it could react.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Grandmaster of Heaven's lightning speed, everyone else seemed to move so slow.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he couldn't dodge the sword strike, Fuxi turned his body around and sacrificed his legs.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>Fuxi's legs were immediately cut clean and blood spurted out.</p>

  <p>There was no sign that the Grandmaster of Heaven was stopping. He quickly launched another sword strike, with the intent of finishing Fuxi off this time.</p>

  <p>"Not on my watch! Myriad Heavy Water!"</p>

  <p>Judson outflanked the Grandmaster of Heaven. With a clap of his hands, a drop of water suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>The droplet of water instantly expanded to a size large enough to envelop the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Now! Condense!"</p>

  <p>The water might look just like an ordinary one, but it was extremely dense.</p>

  <p>As the Grandmaster of Heaven was sealed in it, his movements were immediately restrained. Only then did Fuxi have the chance to escape from the sword strike.</p>

  <p>Then, Gerald quickly approached Fuxi. He stretched out a pincer and gently patted it on Fuxi's wounds. Two dark green forces of truth were injected into the wounds at once, making his broken legs begin regenerating.</p>

  <p>However, the Myriad Heavy Water was only able to seal the Grandmaster of Heaven for a few seconds. After a while, the Grandmaster of Heaven's body suddenly trembled, and the Myriad Heavy Water instantly broke apart, splashing in all directions.</p>

  <p>Just when the Grandmaster of Heaven was about to continue chasing Fuxi, several spores, the size of a fist, suddenly appeared on the surface of his Sanskrit Light Body. The spores quickly latched to his body. The roots wrapped around him and so were the vines that sprouted.</p>

  <p>Apparently, before Judson launched the Myriad Heavy Water, Gerald had discreetly stuffed the spores into it. When the Grandmaster of Heaven was enveloped by the Myriad Heavy Water, the spores quickly attached to his body.</p>

  <p>The thick golden vines were extremely tough. Even the Grandmaster of Heaven struggled hard before he was able to break some of them. However, more and more vines wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven admitted that these Chaos Ancient Gods and Eternal Realm masters were formidable. Even if he was omnipotent, he was still hindered by their tenacious skills and methods.</p>

  <p>"We're not done! Slaughter Prison!"</p>

  <p>Herbert, who was now on the side of the Pear Hill, activated his other theurgy. In a flash, six lightning-like columns began to take shape around the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>However, just before the Slaughter Prison was about to be completed, a snow-white hand reached out from within the golden vines, and a finger pointed at Herbert.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a light emerged in front of Herbert.</p>

  <p>He was so busy activating his bloodline power to set up the Slaughter Prison that he didn't notice the light. Suddenly, the light expanded, and that was the only time that Herbert noted it.</p>

  <p>However, it was too late when Herbert noticed it.</p>

  <p>The white light instantly formed a sturdy space that trapped Herbert within.</p>

  <p>Herbert realized that his life was in great danger. He did all he could in order to break the light column.</p>

  <p>However, the light column was so indestructible that even the ancestry-level bloodline was not able to destroy it. Previously, it had to produce tentacles to absorb the column bit by bit. So Herbert, who only used brute force to break it, didn't make it budge even a little.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an unusual noise resounded from within the light column.</p>

  <p>Herbert's movements were stopped as if there was an extremely powerful force that was pressing on his body.</p>

  <p>The downward pressure in the light column continued to grow stronger and stronger, crushing Herbert's body little by little.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Herbert's body was tightly pressed at the bottom of the light column.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Herbert's bones began to break and his body was starting to collapse.</p>

  <p>The pressure continued to increase. Everyone just stood there, watching his agony as they also couldn't do anything about the light column. At this point, Herbert couldn't even struggle or make a sound anymore. His eyes revealed a look of total helplessness and misery.</p>

  <p>Splat! Hebert's entire body exploded and was completely crushed.</p>

  <p>His huge body, which was millions of feet tall, was reduced into a puddle of blood. Everyone couldn't believe that a dignified Chaos Ancient God could die in this miserable way.</p>

  <p>Gerald, Judson, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess didn't avert their eyes from the scene. Instead, their faces darkened and their eyes were filled with rage.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Grandmaster of Heaven had finally removed all the golden vines that were wrapped on his body. There was a smirk on his face, yet an extreme murderous intent was oozing from his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was getting impatient because his real enemy wasn't there. Originally, he did not intend to use too much of his foundation power, but these people gave him a hard time. With that, he decided to handle them using a fiercer method.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad? Well, you ask for it! Now, I'll kill you one by one!"</p>

  <p>Gerald became instantly aware when the Grandmaster of Heaven pointed at his direction. He knew immediately that something bad was about to happen. He quickly tried to flee, but the light column was already forming before he could even move from his position.</p>

  <p>"You're the next one to die," the Grandmaster of Heaven said coldly.</p>

  <p>Then, the pressure inside the light column suddenly increased. Instantly, Gerald's body was pressed at the bottom.</p>
