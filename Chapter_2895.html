<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2895 The Difficulty Of Blending The Godly Ways </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Blending the Godly Ways was an extremely difficult task.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had had to put a lot of effort into blending three hundred Godly Ways. Naturally, blending three thousand Godly Ways would be a lot more difficult to achieve.</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy would spin out of his control if he failed to blend even one of the three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>When that happened, the Ways-blending Energy would go wild, ready to explode at any moment.</p>

  <p>Such explosions had occurred many times in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>That was why Zheng always chose to do this task in the waters at the edge of his inner world.</p>

  <p>Even so, the aftermath of the explosions had still affected the surrounding continents.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng was trying to blend about 2500 Godly Ways, which was the largest number of Godly Ways he had worked with until now. However, the Ways-blending Energy soon began to go wild.</p>

  <p>As time went by, it became more and more unstable. If it exploded, half of his inner world would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to risk it, Zheng forcefully pulled the Ways-blending Energy out of his inner world.</p>

  <p>The power of the explosion outside shocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>His master had spent a lot of time and effort building this training tower.</p>

  <p>Such places where the time flow rate could be permanently changed were very rare, even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the explosion of Zheng's Ways-blending Energy destroyed the walls of the tower in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Colorful shards began to pop up around the hole caused by the explosion.</p>

  <p>These colorful shards were actually fragments of time. Now that the walls of the tower had been smashed, exposing the tower to the outside world, time in the training tower was once again passing at the same speed as time in the outside world. These fragments of time were the residue of that change.</p>

  <p>"What kind of energy is that? Is he blending several Godly Ways?" Moon asked with a look of surprise on his face.</p>

  <p>During the explosion, he had clearly felt the internal momentum of some Godly Ways, but he had been unable to identify which Godly Ways they were.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time he was seeing a warrior cultivate multiple Godly Ways. Some members of the Moon Clan cultivated multiple Godly Ways, including Moon himself. However, he hadn't spent much time blending them. For one thing, blending the Godly Ways was a very troublesome task.</p>

  <p>Besides, it would do nothing to improve his strength. He had always thought that the best course of action was to concentrate on mastering one specific Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"Depends on what you mean by 'several.' Although I don't know the exact number, I gather that Zheng blended over a thousand Godly Ways," said Mike with a proud smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Over one thousand?" For a moment, Moon was dumbfounded. Then, he asked in an incredulous tone, "Did you just say that Zheng has mastered over a thousand Godly Ways? And he even managed to blend them?"</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a True God could master five or six Godly Ways at most, and even that was rare. Only the elites of the large clans on the Floating Islands would even choose to undertake such an arduous task.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to see a warrior who had mastered more than eight Godly Ways across the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>In fact, as far as Moon could remember, there had once been a consummate True God from a Floating Island who had grasped sixteen Godly Ways. But even he hadn't been able to blend all of them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was, no doubt, a shock to hear that Zheng had not only grasped over a thousand Godly Ways, but had even tried to blend them.</p>

  <p>"You must be joking, Mike! The Godly Ways are very complicated, and the internal momentum of some Godly Ways restricts the internal momentum of the others. That's why it's very tough to blend even two or three Godly Ways, let alone over a thousand. Zheng is only over a hundred years old, so he couldn't have had the time to comprehend so many Godly Ways," Woodruff said, laughing. He obviously didn't believe Mike's words.</p>

  <p>However, Mike replied seriously, "I'm not kidding. In fact, my son hasn't only mastered a thousand Godly Ways, he has mastered all three thousand of them! It's just that he hasn't been able to successfully blend many of them yet."</p>

  <p>Seeing that Mike was being serious, the other Holy Beings couldn't help but gasp in shock.</p>

  <p>"No wonder this young boy was able to kill Nicholas," said Vanessa. Sitting cross-legged, she stared at Zheng from a distance with a trace of fascination on her face.</p>

  <p>Zheng had mastered hundreds of Godly Ways when he had been on the Floating Island. Then, after observing Chiyou's shadow in the Divine Time Temple, he had comprehended how to blend Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Woodruff, who had also been present back then, hadn't been able to understand it at all.</p>

  <p>Anyway, Moon, Woodruff, and the others were unanimously sure of one thing: there was nobody else in the divine land who had comprehended all three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence before Moon said slowly, "The three thousand Godly Ways are the basis of the divine land. What will happen if Zheng manages to merge all of them?"</p>

  <p>The cultivation of the aboriginals in the divine land relied completely on the Godly Way Tablets, so it was not an exaggeration to say that the Godly Ways were the basis of the divine land.</p>

  <p>A mysterious smile appeared on Mike's face. "Well, we still have to wait until the merging is finished. No one knows what will happen."</p>

  <p>Although Mike trusted the members of the Moon Clan, some secrets, such as the existence of the Infinity Ruler, were of so much significance that he could not reveal them to anyone.</p>

  <p>Besides, Mike himself wasn't completely sure about what would happen after the three thousand Godly Ways were merged; it was uncharted territory.</p>

  <p>Zheng's failure had destroyed only the second floor of the training tower, and the third floor remained unaffected.</p>

  <p>The day that the Mountain of Holy Beings would open was getting closer and closer. Before that, Zheng wanted to try his best to merge the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure whether he would be able to fully merge the three thousand Godly Ways in time, but he did know that the more Godly Ways he merged, the more powerful his Ways-blending Energy would be.</p>

  <p>So, after checking the damage that he had caused, Zheng wasted no time and directly went to the third floor of the training tower.</p>

  <p>In a huge cloud far away from the divine land...</p>

  <p>Three huge blood runes appeared around the Chaos Winged Beast.</p>

  <p>The blood runes sped up and closely chased the Chaos Winged Beast no matter how fast it moved in an attempt to escape.</p>

  <p>On the flying ship behind the Chaos Winged Beast stood Clement, holding a large bell in his hand.</p>

  <p>He suddenly hit the bell hard, and the blood runes circled once in the air before shooting three blood arrows at the same time!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Although the blood arrows looked ordinary, they were extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>They directly pierced through the body of the Chaos Winged Beast, leaving six small holes in its body.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He hit the bell once again, and another three blood arrows shot out.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beast immediately howled in pain. As the sharp sound rang throughout the area, the Yellow Emperor Guards watched with joy on their faces.</p>

  <p>"You did it, Master Clement!"</p>

  <p>"After so many years, you finally managed to subdue this beast!"</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! This is a huge credit!"</p>

  <p>They all praised Clement, beaming with excitement.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beast was highly valuable, which was why this group of Yellow Emperor Guards had been hunting it for countless years now.</p>

  <p>It was not until today that they had finally succeeded.</p>

  <p>While the others were shaking with excitement, Clement casually said,</p>

  <p>"Compared to the discovery of the divine land, the Chaos Winged Beast is nothing significant. I never imagined that Chiyou would have built a ship and sent it out of the Source World before his death. We didn't know about it for so many years."</p>
