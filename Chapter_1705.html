<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had showcased his true strength in his battle with Shania and wowed the crowds.</p>

  <p>He had changed the public opinion about him and suddenly, people's perception of who would be first began to swerve.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, everyone thought that it would be Nathan.</p>

  <p>He was the number one Godly Genius and an expert at everything. The only trouble he had was probably from Shania.</p>

  <p>But now that Luo Luo Zheng had defeated Shania, revealing his power, everyone realized that the person who had been annoying them with his Roaring Token back then was already qualified to compete for the first warrior in the universe.</p>

  <p>Nathan was waiting anxiously.</p>

  <p>Tianming was also in the same state.</p>

  <p>Only Kurt was unperturbed. He put his hands together and maintained a calm expression.</p>

  <p>"Tianming from the Thoughtless Minds versus Kurt from the Blessed Buddha Land!" came the announcement.</p>

  <p>When the cold voice rang out, Kurt opened his eyes. A brilliant light shone out from them as his Mu Ning abruptly changed.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, he was as steady as a rock, but in the next moment, he released the Mu Ning of a fierce tiger.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning that emitted from his body was solemn, valiant and ferocious.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Kurt took a giant leap, and like a sinking iron ball, he smashed onto the Heaven Earth Board. His stone crashed onto the board as well.</p>

  <p>Kurt was not famous among the many Godly Geniuses. He was a silent figure.</p>

  <p>Initially, many almighty warriors predicted that of the four warriors from the Thoughtless Minds, at least three would be able to make it into the top five. If this situation were to develop further, then the Thoughtless Minds would become the dominant race in the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>However, the final result was completely unexpected!</p>

  <p>The Thoughtless Minds occupied only one of the top five spots, while the remaining three were in the last five spots.</p>

  <p>Kurt of the Blessed Buddha Land, however, had been able to exploit his full potential and reach this level.</p>

  <p>As for Tianming, he totally stumped everyone!</p>

  <p>While it was true that he originated from the Thoughtless Minds, he himself said that he came from the Cloud Hall, a sect unknown to the onlookers.</p>

  <p>The strength that this person displayed was also shocking.</p>

  <p>He had seamlessly eliminated Xenia, the Godly Genius of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Her premature elimination automatically meant that she could not enter the top ten. This was a big shock for everyone.</p>

  <p>People wondered if Tianming would still surprise everyone by defeating Kurt.</p>

  <p>Kurt entered the board and Tianming also took one step forward. His body floated down and lightly landed on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>His heroic face was already starting to show the fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>After he defeated the man before him, he would face Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Tianming, your desire to win is very strong," Kurt said.</p>

  <p>Tianming flashed a smile. "If you aren't keen on victory, why not just admit defeat now?"</p>

  <p>Kurt slightly nodded, "You are right. I want to win too. But we have different goals."</p>

  <p>"Are you saying that your goal is nobler than mine?" Tianming challenged.</p>

  <p>"No." Kurt shook his head.</p>

  <p>Tianming grasped the hilt of the sword on his back and waved it casually.</p>

  <p>The sheath transformed into a series of shadows in the air, and got embedded two inches deep into the board.</p>

  <p>He could draw the sword out of the sheath if he were to lift the hilt.</p>

  <p>Tianming needed to go all out for this battle.</p>

  <p>Although Kurt's expression was calm, there was a cautious look in his eyes. He took out a Buddhist staff from his cassock.</p>

  <p>The staff was golden red and emitted a dazzling light. Nine rings were connected to the top of the staff. As they rubbed against each other, clear and melodious sounds emitted from the staff nonstop.</p>

  <p>This was the Nine-ring Staff!</p>

  <p>It was the most precious treasure of the Hidden Spirit Temple.</p>

  <p>This supreme divine weapon ranked seventh on the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>This supreme divine weapon had not been seen for many years, and it was unsurprising that Kurt, the number one figure of the Blessed Buddha Land, owned the staff.</p>

  <p>"Amitabha. Tianming, you can make the first move," Kurt said to Tianming with his staff in his hand.</p>

  <p>He had said the same words when he had fought Lawson.</p>

  <p>Kurt never made the first move.</p>

  <p>His strategy was to destroy every move that his opponent made, using an even fiercer method.</p>

  <p>This was contrary to popular fighting methods, where most warriors would choose to strike first to gain the upper hand.</p>

  <p>However, Kurt's technique meant to be released later and arrive later. It laid emphasis on planning before making a move.</p>

  <p>A hint of surprise flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes when he heard Kurt's offer.</p>

  <p>During Tianming's battle with Xenia, he had showcased his awe-inspiring speed.</p>

  <p>It was a good idea to plan before making a move. Kurt would wait for the opponent to make a move, and then cleverly break it apart. While he was doing so, he would also counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming had always won due to his speed, so how would Kurt cope with that?</p>

  <p>Tianming didn't say no. He was a gentleman, but that didn't mean he was not competitive.</p>

  <p>He held the hilt of the sword and took a step forward. However, the sheath was still buried within the board.</p>

  <p>One more step, and his sword would get unsheathed.</p>

  <p>The body of the sword had already been pulled out two feet. The majority of it was still embedded in the sheath, but the two-foot blade, which was revealed, shone with a dazzling light, making it difficult to see clearly.</p>

  <p>Countless pairs of eyes were staring at the sword, to see just how much power the sword could unleash.</p>

  <p>Kurt's expression was calm as he looked at Tianming indifferently, the Nine-ring Staff in his hand slightly tilted.</p>

  <p>He was aware that Tianming's speed was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>But just relying on speed didn't make Tianming a formidable opponent.</p>

  <p>Tianming took another step.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The sound of the sword being unsheathed reverberated through the board.</p>

  <p>A ray of light appeared in Tianming's hand.</p>

  <p>It happened too fast!</p>

  <p>The onlookers couldn't see Tianming's sword clearly, so they thought that he was holding onto a dazzling light.</p>

  <p>He stepped on the light and slashed with it.</p>

  <p>Tianming arrived in front of Kurt in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Tianming's shadow was encircling Kurt.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he appeared right in front of Kurt. However, before he launched a sword attack, his body suddenly disappeared. Then he struck his sword out from behind Kurt.</p>

  <p>Chop, slash, stab, tap...</p>

  <p>Every single sword light was deadly.</p>

  <p>Every step he took was also inextricably linked to the next assault.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Kurt was much slower.</p>

  <p>In fact, compared to Tianming, Kurt was moving at a snail's speed.</p>

  <p>Although Kurt was slow, he was accurately blocking every single strike of his opponent.</p>

  <p>Every time he waved his staff, he fended off Tianming's attack. From the start to finish, it was perfect!</p>

  <p>Those who didn't know the situation might think that the duo had practiced it beforehand. The timing, speed, and strength were all accurate.</p>

  <p>"That's the power of Future Constellation Kalpa."</p>

  <p>"The little monk has mastered the Time Law to such an extent. It's truly amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Kurt also has the capability to compete for first place!"</p>

  <p>Based on Kurt's speed, if he were to brandish his staff once, Tianming might have been able to strike out with a hundred swords.</p>

  <p>But by relying on the Future Constellation Kalpa, he was able to determine Tianming's sword moves and attacks to a certain extent, and block them accordingly.</p>

  <p>Because of this, not only were Tianming's attacks not fatal, they were also getting obstructed in advance by Kurt's staff.</p>

  <p>Kurt only needed to place the staff somewhere and it would force Tianming to change his movement, causing him incomparable distress.</p>

  <p>The first round of exchanges lasted for a few seconds. Then, Tianming turned into a ray of light and whizzed off swiftly.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>He sheathed his sword!</p>

  <p>Tianming took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>The two of them had exchanged thousands of blows in the span of a few seconds.</p>

  <p>It was true that the two of them did not wield much power and influence, but the danger they posed was not insignificant.</p>

  <p>"Your speed is of no use to me. You'd better figure out another plan,"</p>

  <p>Kurt said indifferently and stood his ground.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and revealed a smile. "You are wrong. See?"</p>

  <p>Kurt's gaze turned solemn. At the same time, an explosive sound came from his Nine-ring Staff.</p>

  <p>One of the nine rings was broken!</p>

  <p>"Your sword is so strong! It should be more precious than the weapons on the Spirit Tablet. Huh?" A strange expression appeared on Kurt's face.</p>

  <p>How could a seventh-ranked supreme divine weapon be so easily damaged?</p>

  <p>The Nine-ring Staff had already lost one of its rings in the exchanges just now.</p>

  <p>Even the Saint Killing Spear couldn't achieve this feat.</p>

  <p>"A sword that surpasses the weapons on the Spirit Tablet! Does this mean his sword is beyond the supreme divine weapon?"</p>

  <p>"Then what rank is Tianming's sword?"</p>

  <p>"What? There are weapons that are not recorded on the Spirit Tablet?"</p>

  <p>This controversy about Tianming's sword once again attracted the attention of countless warriors.</p>
