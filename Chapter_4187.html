<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven returned to the Night View Island a few days later.</p>

  <p>He had come to give Zheng the Bird Masters' coordinates.</p>

  <p>In most cases, putting your life in the hands of others was ill-advised and even idiotic.</p>

  <p>But the Bird Masters had nowhere to go and were willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the safety of the Bird Spirit King. They were loyal to him until their deaths.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, they truly believed in the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The friendship between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect was much deeper than Zheng and his companions had imagined.</p>

  <p>On the day the alliance was formed, Manuel squatted beside but still managed to hear every word the two sides spoke.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King and the Great Ape King were both very reckless, but not stupid.</p>

  <p>They trusted Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven because they were humans with the same goal they had. This made them trustworthy.</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters trusted anyone the Monkey Spirit King did.</p>

  <p>However, Manuel had come to retrieve the coordinates on the very same day they were sent to Zheng, claiming they were not safe in Zheng's hands and should be protected by the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Whether he really wanted them protected or just not to be with Zheng remained unknown.</p>

  <p>The addition of the Bird Spirit Sect to the alliance gave the human heroes much confidence.</p>

  <p>They had, after all, been isolated and helpless once before. But now, against all expectations, they had gained the support of the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Entering the Jade Pure Realm was then put on the agenda, but they would still need to prepare carefully to find a better opportunity to do so.</p>

  <p>In the chaos, the primitive land was still methodically devouring thousands of heads.</p>

  <p>The primitive land was once only twice the size of the Pear Hill; it could even touch the top of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>But now, if one stood atop the Pear Hill and looked out into the distance, they would see the boundless blood red sky. The primitive land had become incredibly expansive.</p>

  <p>Zheng had moved the continents that had been floating in the sky down.</p>

  <p>They were now placed in the middle of the Pear Hill and the Ruin Graveyard, serving as a bridge between them.</p>

  <p>Another three mountains appeared on the other side of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Each mountain had a different shape and was about a third of the size of the Pear Hill. These were the lairs Zheng had built for the three Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient Gods had curled up in the Pear Hill before, but now there was enough space for them to have their own lairs.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Thunder rumbled in the blood red sky, causing everyone in the Pear Hill, the continents and the Ruin Graveyard to raise their heads.</p>

  <p>"Mother, it's thunder."</p>

  <p>In the fairy palace, Salome covered her ears with her hands as fear rattled in her big black eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, Salome. It's not thunder; it's your father cultivating."</p>

  <p>Margaret held Salome in her arms tightly and tried to soothe her with words of comfort.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Salome.</p>

  <p>"Look over there. That figure is your father," said Margaret, pointing up to the sky.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the blood red sky, a tiny figure could be seen floating.</p>

  <p>There had been a huge change in Zheng's inner world in the past few days.</p>

  <p>From what they understood of Zheng's explanation, they knew the entire Pear Hill had been placed in the primitive land.</p>

  <p>More surprisingly, even the Ruin Graveyard and the divine land were placed in the primitive land not long after.</p>

  <p>All this considered, Zheng's inner world had become quite lively.</p>

  <p>Aura, Yudie and Xun wished to return to the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Nelly and Liusu couldn't wait to return to the divine land and reunite with their families.</p>

  <p>In the blood mist, Zheng's body floated like seaweed in a calm ocean current.</p>

  <p>Every five minutes, the blood red thunderbolts whipped at him like vines.</p>

  <p>These strikes didn't cause him any pain, but they did infuse strength into his body.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! dozens of blood red thunderbolts surged into Zheng, causing cracks to appear on his body, like a porcelain sculpture that was about to shatter into pieces.</p>

  <p>"My body is going to break. I can't bear it any longer!" Zheng shouted from within the thunder.</p>

  <p>The blood red thunder quickly disappeared and the sky returned to peace.</p>

  <p>Bright green raindrops then rained down onto Zheng's body. They were like tiny bugs, crawling into the cracks and repairing them with visible quickness.</p>

  <p>After being refined, Zheng's body was absorbed by the ancestry-level bloodline to create a nearly perfect body.</p>

  <p>His body now began being refined again. He had already been struck by the blood red thunder thirteen times.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take to reach the limit?" Zheng asked exhaustedly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. As far as I can remember, there is no limit to the strength of the physical body. I once strengthened a host to a truly terrifying level," said the ancestry-level bloodline recalling the past.</p>

  <p>Its memory had always been a mess. Some key memories had disappeared, but some details remained very clearly.</p>

  <p>"Oh? How terrifying do you mean?" Zheng's eyebrows trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>It must have meant something horrible when it said "terrifying".</p>

  <p>"Even a full blow with ninety percent of the Stellar World's energy could not destroy his body," answered the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The Stellar World was the fifth-grade world, referred to as the Deep Space by the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>If it was merely an independent secondary world such as the chaos, Zheng would not be that amazed. But the Stellar World was the fifth-grade world!</p>

  <p>Ninety percent of the energy in the fifth-grade world was undoubtedly a terrifying prospect. What kind of incomprehensible power could withstand such a blow?</p>

  <p>"It's a pity I've forgotten what that host looked like, and even his name," the ancestry-level bloodline sighed dejectedly. "I failed in every battle with those downgraders."</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline possessed intense strength, but its opponents were always able to defeat it.</p>

  <p>"This time is different," Zheng said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Why is that?" asked the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Because this time, I'm your host," Zheng answered confidently.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was silent for a moment; it did not wish to frustrate Zheng. "Let's begin the fourteenth refinement with blood red thunderbolts. After fifty, I will fill your body with space spores."</p>

  <p>"Is that another method to strengthen the body?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it strengthens your body with the power of space."</p>

  <p>"Is it the final method of strengthening?"</p>

  <p>"No, there are several others."</p>

  <p>Soon after, the blood red sky rumbled once more and thunderbolts as thick as tree trunks whirled in the sky and rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just then, countless shadows were suddenly reflected in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He saw the silhouettes of mountains, thunderbolts, and his body in the distance.</p>

  <p>These were the Variable Images!</p>

  <p>Another Shade Stone descended.</p>

  <p>It had only been a few months since the last Shade Stone appeared. It seemed the frequency of its appearance was certainly ramping up.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a square black stone floated over a thousand feet above the middle of the Blood Sea Province, quickly attracting the people's attention.</p>
