  <p>
</p>

  <p>A giant Elephant Man stood behind Luo Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be angry at their arrival. The moment he finished speaking, a huge hand slapped Luo Zheng and Feng Ge around their heads.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to protect Feng Ge and the slap landed on his body. The two of them crashed to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Elephant Man quickly located Luo Zheng and Feng Ge through the grass, raised one huge foot and stomped hard down on them.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>The Elephant Man was huge, his explosive power naturally astonishing.</p>

  <p>He continued to stomp on them for a while before another Elephant Man stopped him. "Ramsay, you've trampled the spies into meat paste!"</p>

  <p>Ramsay snorted and walked towards the black bulls.</p>

  <p>It had been several days since the Elephant Men started to chase these bulls.</p>

  <p>They finally drove the bulls towards the fences made of lightning wood.</p>

  <p>They could easily knock the black bulls down using the lightning contained within the lightning wood. The black bulls could serve as their food for half a month.</p>

  <p>Ramsay had just turned when a rumble of thunder sounded across the skies.</p>

  <p>The sound wasn't loud, but it was clear and audible.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Ramsay was surprised when a tiny bolt of lightning flashed before his forehead and came to a stop a few feet from him. This mosquito-sized fellow hadn't been crushed into meat paste after all!</p>

  <p>"Hey, foreign friend!" Luo Zheng said, an amused smile playing on his lips.</p>

  <p>He hadn't come to the Elephant Men's territory to cause trouble. He had only wanted to know more about Stage Seventeen's terrain. And although Ramsay had thrashed him around like a rag doll, he managed to restrain his anger.</p>

  <p>"You are still alive!"</p>

  <p>Ramsay had no interest in communicating with Luo Zheng. He brought his huge fist smashing down towards Luo Zheng's head again.</p>

  <p>Ramsay's fist was about eight hundred feet wide and to Luo Zheng, it looked like a flying hill was coming for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned at the sight of the fist and he finally let the anger show on his face.</p>

  <p>He knew that if he didn't teach them a lesson, they weren't going to talk nicely.</p>

  <p>The moment the fist landed before Luo Zheng, he punched into the air. Ramsay's fist was three thousand times bigger than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>It looked like a man's fist was fighting a flying mosquito.</p>

  <p>Ramsay had good eyesight. Even if Luo Zheng looked like a tiny speck, he could still clearly see all of Luo Zheng's movements.</p>

  <p>How could a mosquito fight him? Ramsay sneered.</p>

  <p>But the moment he came in contact with Luo Zheng, he felt a dull throbbing pain in his fist.</p>

  <p>He had been forcefully blocked by a man the size of a tiny mosquito!</p>

  <p>"This is impossible!"</p>

  <p>Ramsay said, his eyes wide in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The Elephant Men were large, arrogant, and confident about their own size and strength.</p>

  <p>How could Ramsay allow a mere mosquito to block his attack?</p>

  <p>The muscles in his right arm bulged and his strength continued to explode in an attempt to suppress the mosquito in front of him.</p>

  <p>But the tiny mosquito was like a wall that could not be crossed.</p>

  <p>All the other Elephant Men had originally headed straight for the black bulls but they turned around at the sounds. They watched Ramsay's movements, confused.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Ramsay?" asked the chieftain of the Elephant Men.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to see Luo Zheng from where they were standing.</p>

  <p>Ramsay's face turned red with anger. He used up all his strength, gritted his teeth, and said, "This little thing's strength is terrifying!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he withdrew his fist and sent it flying at Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>This punch hit the invisible wall as well. The air stirred around them and the tall grass came crashing to the ground. But Luo Zheng still managed to stand his ground.</p>

  <p>To take the brunt of Ramsay's fist, Luo Zheng drew out his force and turned it into a fist that was over a thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>If he had gathered his strength in his body just to take Ramsay's punch, he would probably have drilled into Ramsay's fist like a steel needle.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!"</p>

  <p>Ramsay roared, and his fists lashed out at Luo Zheng yet again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood upright in the air and raised his hand. Under the spread of the invisible force, the transparent space around him twisted and formed a tall wall of force that blocked Ramsay's attacks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng planned to talk to Ramsay after his power was exhausted.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Feng Ge called out, "Luo Zheng, watch your back!"</p>

  <p>Despite her cautioning, she wasn't really worried about Luo Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>The Elephant Men were terrifyingly tall, over ten thousand feet, but they were only creatures from the Light Region of Stage Seventeen. They weren't ridiculously strong and wouldn't be able to do anything to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had barely turned around when a giant hand grabbed him. An Elephant Man was intending to crush him to death.</p>

  <p>As the Elephant Man clenched his fist, he felt like he was holding a hard stone in his hand. How was he supposed to crush it?</p>

  <p>A thought seemed to occur to him as he tossed Luo Zheng aside and pulled out a stone spear from behind him. He raised the spear and swung it towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Luo Zheng's body expanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, his body had grown to become several hundred feet tall.</p>

  <p>His body continued to grow rapidly while blocking the stone spear. It had very quickly grown to a height of more than ten thousand feet. He then grabbed the tip of the stone spear with one hand and frowned at the two Elephant Men in front of him.</p>

  <p>The Elephant Men that were hunting the black bulls were stunned as they watched Luo Zheng's body expand from the size of a mosquito to match their size.</p>

  <p>Their huge ears drooped as their jaws dropped in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"My friends, you should know that I will give my all if you insist on fighting with me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said, pulling the stone spear out of the hands of the Elephant Man. He waved it in the air before crushing it in his hand.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>With a resounding crack, Luo Zheng had crushed the stone spear, which was over ten thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>The stone spear was sturdy and was made of solid white stones. There weren't many of it in the Elephant Man race.</p>

  <p>The Elephant Men gulped in fear at this display of Luo Zheng's power.</p>

  <p>Their chieftain was quick to react. Realizing that they couldn't afford to offend Luo Zheng, he hurriedly stepped forward and said, "Sir, there must be a misunderstanding. Please don't get angry."</p>
