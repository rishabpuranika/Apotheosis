<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1831 The Temptation (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>A martial artist entering the Calamity Dispelling Forest would just as much end up giving into their most basic desires. Anyone breathing the oxygen provided by these trees would fold beneath the pressure of temptation in no time. All desires were pushed to their extremes, even the most insignificant. After the desires to eat, to love and to possess had been magnified countless times, people would act like the beasts.</p>

  <p>"They light these bonfires and eat heartily here every day. These people, who have stayed here for a long time, also know that it is time for the members of the Collapsing Mountain race to eat, so they stimulate their appetite," Han Liusu explained calmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "There's no wonder their eyes lit up the way they did when they saw that piece of meat earlier. How long have they endured this?</p>

  <p>Years and years at the very least..."</p>

  <p>Anyone who was tied up, cuffed and forced to look at delicious food that they could not consume every day would go insane. Sure, the warriors were strong willed but this torture was on another level. The Calamity Dispelling Fragrance in the air disturbed their levels and notions of desire, making self-control impossible.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng spoke, his gaze fell on Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Although he'd spoken to her in the past, he hadn't paid much attention to this woman before. Now, he could do nothing but take notice. His eyes looked her up and down, drinking in the beauty he had never noticed before.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu was also a rare fairy-like figure with the typical neat and tidy hair. She also had a delicate, beautiful face. She wore a simple dress with a dark pattern on it, and was wrapped in a long elegant robe. Although she was lying on the ground, her exquisite and curvaceous figure suddenly appeared utterly attractive.</p>

  <p>"Stop looking at me!"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu squealed, as she glared at Luo Luo Zheng with a warning in her big, pretty eyes.</p>

  <p>Caught off guard and snapped out of his thoughts, Luo Luo Zheng held his breath and turned his head slowly in order to face the other direction. Although he couldn't see her straight on, his peripheral vision still caught glimpses of her.</p>

  <p>The Calamity Dispelling Fragrance had the power to arouse a person's appetite of course, but it had this same effect on most any desire. Under regular circumstances, only male martial artists would refine their bodies. Because none of these male martial artists had sexual desires for each other before, their desires were thus not enhanced by the wood.</p>

  <p>Now though, the situation was different. Han Liusu was a woman, she was here, and she was ravishing.</p>

  <p>And that was when Han Liusu finally understood Luo Zheng's reaction, too. She blushed with embarrassment and decided it was best to chant the Heart Purifying Spell in order to calm herself down. Was she starting to feel the increased sexual arousal as well?</p>

  <p>When all the bonfires were flaming high, sending sparks flying in all directions like mini fireworks, it was time for the warriors to face the most painful moment of all! Worse than any form of torment or torture, what they had to face now was the climax of absolute misery.</p>

  <p>Giant chunks of meat had been hauled up into the air and were now rolling and tumbling over the raging flames. The bonfire feast had begun! As the raw meat began to grizzle beneath the flames and the chunks of fat exploded due to the incredible heat, a smell that made everyone run at the mouth quickly wafted over.</p>

  <p>The smells, odors and fragrances of the cooking meat was indescribable.</p>

  <p>To the martial artists, it felt like the devil sitting on their shoulder, whispering in their ear to give in, stirring their most primitive of nerves.</p>

  <p>"UGH..."</p>

  <p>"I just can't take this anymore!"</p>

  <p>"I'm completely starved!"</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors, lying on the ground, were groaning, grunting and screaming. It was clear that they were enduring an unimaginable pain.</p>

  <p>Genuine torture without the use of any physical weapons.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race had become accustomed to hearing the martial artists' cries of hunger. Of course, causing them this pain was intentional, but over time their moaning and groaning had become simply annoying. One of the race members walked briskly over to a warrior. "Shut up!" he said coldly, resisting the urge to kick him in the ribs at the same time. "Do you have the ability? Because if you do, then you can get up, walk right over and enjoy some delicious food and never-ending wine. Isn't that what you want, huh? If you don't have the ability, then you can't have anything to eat or get a drop to drink. And you don't have the ability, isn't that right? So continue lying there obediently!"</p>

  <p>'If only they get up, they'd be able to eat the meat...' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>And over time, this was probably the biggest temptation of all!</p>

  <p>For any warrior to walk this land, the increased desire to consume food was one of the cruelest trials that they had to go through. And any warrior knew that their lives were filled with harsh treatments and difficult physical and mental tests.</p>

  <p>This gravitational force and desire were incomparably strong. The warriors' desires were stimulated all while the incredible power of the gravitation pressed down on them. It was simple though: Resist the terrifying force of gravitation and be rewarded with giant breakthroughs for body refiners. That was how they truly satisfied their desires.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, being a newcomer here, was still highly capable of resisting the temptation of food. Liusu's alluring figure, though, was another issue.</p>

  <p>Her silhouette kept flashing before his eyes, and he had to resist the urge to reach for her sexy curves.</p>

  <p>'It's all so troublesome, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself, all while trying as best he could to stifle the desire in his heart and distract his mind.</p>

  <p>He raised his gaze to the action going on a little further ahead and watched a little while as the members of the Collapsing Mountain race gobbled their food like savages, tearing at the meat with their teeth. They drank greedily in between mouthfuls, going from tipsy to straight out drunk.</p>

  <p>There was no wonder the Collapsing Mountain members were so strong.</p>

  <p>The strength of their children even surpassed that of an ordinary martial artist. Every member gulfed down hoards of meat and food, from the youngest to the very oldest.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was sure he had watched one of the younger members fill himself with food twice his weight. Eating was also an extreme talent around here. Of course, the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance was effective on Luo Luo Zheng and the warriors, but it also had effect on the members of the Collapsing Mountain race. Their desires and needs were multiplied, too.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that an adult member of the Collapsing Mountain race could swallow enough meat to fill an entire house! Without the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance, anyone would burst before consuming that much food.</p>

  <p>"I... I just want to eat..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was beginning to lose himself in his thoughts when suddenly, he noticed a martial artist squirming and struggling on the ground. What was going on? The warrior suddenly stood up.</p>

  <p>As he did so, two terribly crisp sounds rang through the air, one after the other. Those weren't expecting it covered their ears in surprise.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng watched as the warrior's legs began to twist at absurd angles. No bones could fold this way. The warrior's legs were broken in several places, shards of bone pressing against his skin, threatening to pierce it at any given moment.</p>

  <p>When the martial artist erupted with his full strength, he might have held a chance at temporarily escaping the powerful attraction force. Although his mind might have had the will, his body was not capable of withstanding such vicious strength. The martial artist collapsed to the ground, breaking beneath the interaction between his own powers and that of the attraction force.</p>

  <p>And at that, Luo Luo Zheng finally sighed with emotion. Here, in this world, there was no such thing as a free lunch. Sure, it might be wise to raise one's strength in this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but one would also have to experience the most brutal oppression and torture.</p>
