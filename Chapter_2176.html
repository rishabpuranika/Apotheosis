<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had originally intended to throw the White Jade Token up as he pleased. He didn't have any desire to fight for the top spot.</p>

  <p>After all, he did not want to attract too much attention before even joining the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>The only reason he had defeated Eric at the Brilliant Moon Restaurant was that he had been tempted by the five thousand divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have bothered to take action.</p>

  <p>But now, Zane was trying to provoke him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, most of the proving godly warriors expectantly turned to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They wanted to see if Luo Luo Zheng was as strong as the rumors said he was or if they were just an exaggeration.</p>

  <p>"The rest of you, please throw your White Jade Tokens. Then, I will make a list," Malloy said. Although his tone was very faint and he didn't mention any specific names, everyone could tell that his words were targeted toward Luo Luo Zheng in particular. Moreover, Malloy seemed to dislike Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As per Malloy's instructions, the rest of the proving godly warriors threw their White Jade Tokens one by one. Soon, Luo Luo Zheng was the only one left holding the White Jade Token.</p>

  <p>"He must be a coward," a proving godly warrior said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Agreed. He's afraid of losing face."</p>

  <p>"Everyone who is in the Heavenly Han House should behave themselves.</p>

  <p>Why is he going against the Han Clan?"</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng heard these words, he felt a bit helpless.</p>

  <p>He wanted to join the Heavenly Han House. When had he ever gone against the Han Clan?</p>

  <p>It was these fellows who had provoked him!</p>

  <p>"You're the only one left. Stop putting on airs. Just show your strength!"</p>

  <p>Zane demanded with a sour expression on his face. The faint smile on Luo Zheng's face displeased him.</p>

  <p>"Well then..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed softly.</p>

  <p>He then gently flipped the White Jade Token twice in his hand.</p>

  <p>Zane, Seth, Eric, and even Malloy all watched Luo Zheng's White Jade Token with unwavering attention.</p>

  <p>Even though the test of the Han Clan had begun, none of them knew Luo Zheng's name and origin. Even when Zane had asked him about it outright, he hadn't said anything. Since none of the people present had any measure of Luo Zheng's abilities, they were paying close attention to him out of sheer curiosity.</p>

  <p>On Luo Zheng's White Jade Token were clearly carved the words "Tianxing Luo from Misty Mountain Village." As soon as they read it, the place erupted into discourse.</p>

  <p>"So his surname is Luo."</p>

  <p>"Misty Mountain Village? Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Such small villages can be found everywhere in the 36 regions. There might be hundreds of thousands of them. Who knows where this village is?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already decided to disguise himself as a divine citizen who came from Misty Mountain Village. Since he had already stepped into the Divine Dao, no one would be able to tell that he once used to be a secondary creature.</p>

  <p>Ignoring the murmurs around him, he slowly walked forward a few steps before raising his head to look at the sky. Then, he smiled and asked,</p>

  <p>"Do you really look forward to it that much?"</p>

  <p>Zane's face froze. He hadn't expected Luo Luo Zheng to reply with such arrogance.</p>

  <p>"What am I looking forward to? I just want to see you make a fool of yourself!" he retorted without missing a beat.</p>

  <p>"Fine."</p>

  <p>As he gently held the White Jade Token in his hand, Luo Luo Zheng allowed a cynical smile to spread on his face. Then, he lifted the White Jade Token far above his head and slung his arm back like he was about to launch it into the air. At the same time, the nine stars in his inner world began to revolve slowly. His body rose abruptly, and veins bulged out from his temples all the way to his heels.</p>

  <p>35% strength!</p>

  <p>Even though his cultivation level had not increased in recent times, with constant training, both his physical body and his inner world had grown by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>Relying on his body alone, he could easily withstand 35% of the strength source from the nine stars.</p>

  <p>As the strength source madly revolved within his body, it moved through every inch of him in a seemingly distorted way.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>A crisp sound resounded in the air the moment he slung the White Jade Token forward with his hand. It was like a large entity had been slapped.</p>

  <p>The White Jade Token had been crushed into pieces in mid-air.</p>

  <p>The pieces of debris landed on the bodies of some of the proving godly warriors nearby. For a moment, because of the impact combined with the crisp sound, they all thought that they had been slapped by Luo Luo Zheng. Each and every one of them stared stupidly at Luo Luo Zheng, clueless as to what they had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>Zane, who didn't get hit by the debris, saw that the White Jade Token was broken and immediately assumed that Luo Luo Zheng had crushed it on purpose. In the silence that ensued, he sneered, "Humph, it's fine if you don't dare to make a move, but you intentionally damaged the White Jade Token. You're smart!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand at Zane and innocently said, "Sorry. I forgot that the White Jade Token is just a piece of jade. It's too brittle."</p>

  <p>Zane laughed incredulously and said, "Don't make excuses..."</p>

  <p>But before he could finish his sentence, a voice said, "Shut up!"</p>

  <p>It was Malloy; although his words were directed at Zane, he was staring at Luo Luo Zheng with complete caution? and he was not the only one.</p>

  <p>All of the other True Gods, as well as Master Wu, were staring at Luo Luo Zheng in a mixture of surprise and fear.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, they had wondered how this seemingly ordinary man had been able to defeat Eric, who had been given rigorous training by the Hulan Clan, with just one move. Most of them had written it off as a random stroke of luck.</p>

  <p>But now, they could not ignore the truth that was staring them in the eyes.</p>

  <p>Just now, when Luo Luo Zheng had suddenly flung the White Jade Token into the air, he had caused space to bend a little.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Luo Zheng could easily tear space at will.</p>

  <p>However, the stability of space in the divine land was beyond his imagination. Even though he had used 35% of his strength and focused all of it into his right hand, it had only caused space to bend slightly.</p>

  <p>But this slight bend alone had rendered all of the True Gods present speechless.</p>

  <p>Aside from Malloy, who was a mid-rank True God, the rest of them were all low-rank True Gods. However, with their vast amounts of experience, they knew that there were only two types of people in the divine land that could influence space.</p>

  <p>One was the consummate True Gods who had surpassed the level of top-rank True Gods, while the other was Holy Beings. However, there was no doubt that the man standing in front of them had distorted space by relying on his strength alone. This was an unimaginable thing that no one present had ever heard of.</p>

  <p>They had also clearly seen that it wasn't Luo Luo Zheng himself who had crushed the White Jade Token, but the great impact that the token had with the air.</p>

  <p>The air in the divine land was much more viscous than the air in the Evolutionary Universe. Therefore, all life forms that entered the divine land would feel an invisible pressure acting on their bodies. However, the original inhabitants of the divine land had long become accustomed to this. The invisible pressure of the air was similar to the powerful gravitational force of the Collapsing Mountain race's place in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Since the air was so viscous, when the White Jade Token had instantly accelerated to an extremely high speed, the air had formed an invisible wall against it. The White Jade Token was not strong enough to break through the wall of air by itself, so it had been blown to smithereens.</p>

  <p>Although it had all happened in a split second, the True Gods understood this and began to ponder in their hearts how much power Luo Luo Zheng actually possessed.</p>

  <p>As soon as Malloy had realized that Luo Luo Zheng from Misty Mountain Village was not an ordinary warrior, he had begun to be very cautious. However, Zane was still talking nonsense and embarrassing the Han Clan, so Malloy was annoyed and couldn't help scolding him.</p>

  <p>But Zane, who had finally gotten a chance to humiliate Luo Luo Zheng, didn't want to let go of the matter. His eyes blazed with fury as he insisted, "Uncle Malloy, he intentionally broke..."</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Malloy's voice turned as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>As a senior of the Han Clan, he couldn't afford to lose face even if Zane ended up doing a good job today.</p>

  <p>"Zane, as Uncle Malloy said, don't say anything," Seth advised.</p>

  <p>Seth was one of the many people present who hadn't clearly seen what had happened, but he was good at gauging the atmosphere and reading people's minds. From the surprised and cautious way Malloy and the other True Gods were staring at Luo Luo Zheng, Seth could tell that Luo Luo Zheng had done something extraordinary just now and that he couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>With a drastic change in his attitude, Malloy slowly walked over to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The cold smile on his face had disappeared; now, his face was filled with kindness as he said, "You're Tianxing Luo, right? And you are from Misty Mountain Village. Our clan rules 36 regions, and there are a total of 13 Misty Mountain Villages. In which region is the Misty Mountain Village you live in located?"</p>

  <p>"I come from the Misty Mountain Village in the Vast Sky Region," replied Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The Vast Sky Region," Malloy repeated, memorizing the name. He was planning to send someone to investigate Luo Zheng's background. He smiled at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "It's a pity that the White Jade Token has been damaged, but it's not your fault. How about we give you something else to throw?</p>

  <p>Otherwise, I wouldn't know where to put you on the list."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no objections to Malloy's arrangement, so he casually nodded his head.</p>
