  <p>
</p>

  <p>The energy flowing like a river began eroding the Otherworldly Swordsman's body.</p>

  <p>Even the rules of the heavens in the Hall of Causality were nothing in the swordsman's eyes.</p>

  <p>The dark iron sword in his hand possessed enough strength to surpass the heavens, after all.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Illusion Space, the sword itself had told him that the Illusion Battlefield had a special repulsive force against it— no soul nor living creature could enter along with him.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng also failed to bring Xun and the cyan dragon into the Illusion Battlefield. The Illusion Battlefield's projection could only accept Zheng alone. Currently, he was still unable to even communicate with them.</p>

  <p>But the sword of the Otherworldly Swordsman forcibly broke through the rules of the Illusion Battlefield, managing to enter the area.</p>

  <p>The sword clearly knew that if it did not arrive, it would be difficult for the Otherworldly Swordsman to achieve any great outcome with solely his own strength.</p>

  <p>After bringing this sword into the battlefield, the Otherworldly Swordsman had full confidence that he would take the first place among all the warriors.</p>

  <p>In his mind, the ace talents and even the Godly Geniuses, who were considered extremely formidable, were no match for him.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Causality was undoubtedly dangerous— those who weren't cautious enough were likely to end up dead. In only the second Hall of Causality he had just passed through, countless ropes were already trying to trap the warriors in and squeeze the lives out of them. According to the rules of the Hall of Causality, it was impossible to sever those ropes.</p>

  <p>But the Otherworldly Swordsman managed to wield his sword, forcefully shattering the very rules of the heavens.</p>

  <p>With him there, none of the ten warriors were left dead as they challenged through the hall. Of course, this earned him everyone's admiration. The Otherworldly Swordsman called 'Lone' seemed to be a remarkable, practically invincible warrior.</p>

  <p>Under his leadership, they just might pass through the Hall of Causality without any major problems.</p>

  <p>With the great outcome, the ten of them could make it to the top ten warriors of this supreme world.</p>

  <p>But just when they made it to the third Hall of Causality, they encountered another group of warriors. Because they survived the second hall, they thought that with the Otherworldly Swordsman's power, they could easily deal with the seven warriors of the other group.</p>

  <p>But what was about to unfold was beyond their expectations.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, Lone fell into the river of energy.</p>

  <p>"I can't accept this… Take me up there!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, the river of energy eroded the layer of gold on his body.</p>

  <p>The dark colored iron sword was truly powerful and formidable, serving as the swordsman's savior. If any other warrior were to fall into this river, they would be instantly dissolved into nothing.</p>

  <p>"It's useless now. But it doesn't matter if we don't make it this once... We can still catch up," replied the sword.</p>

  <p>"Can't you let me float up first? I have a few words for that guy!"</p>

  <p>Never did the swordsman think that he would be defeated in the Hall of Causality by a nameless young warrior. With his arrogant personality, how could he accept the fact just like that?</p>

  <p>"Alas…"</p>

  <p>The dark colored iron sword emitted a dazzling golden light as it dragged the swordsman up from the bottom of the river.</p>

  <p>With the sword's power at its peak, it was enough to let the man move freely in the river of energy. It was possible for the sword to easily destroy the current round of the heavens, after all. But now that it could not play at its full strength, the swordsman could only remain safe in the river for a short while.</p>

  <p>Even so, the other warriors on both sides of the ravine were left dumbstruck at the scene.</p>

  <p>Seeing the swordsman fall into the river made some warriors' hearts sink.</p>

  <p>After the battle in the second Hall of Causality, those proud talents had great admiration for his strength. Now that he so easily fell into the river, they were stunned even more.</p>

  <p>But the members of Zheng's group immediately recognized the swordsman.</p>

  <p>The moment the Otherworldly Swordsman appeared in the darkness, Janet already recognized him.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman...</p>

  <p>He was the man who turned famous from just a single battle.</p>

  <p>This warrior appeared out of the blue and stole the limelight from Lucille.</p>

  <p>It was a shame Lucille didn't get the chance to fight against him in the four great clans' competition.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey recognized him as well— Lone had become famous after defeating an ace talent of the Blessed Buddha Land in the past. His performance in battle was undoubtedly striking.</p>

  <p>When Janet saw him, she sighed inwardly, already feeling a sense of despair.</p>

  <p>She trusted Zheng— he was far stronger than her, Jeffrey, Hailey, and the others. But no one was certain he could easily go up against the ace talents.</p>

  <p>But in mere seconds, Zheng dragged himself and the swordsman into a life threatening situation. Before Janet could understand what was going on, the Otherworldly Swordsman had fallen into a river of energy and disappeared. She figured he would die there.</p>

  <p>Instead of making use of his own strength to win the battle, Zheng relied on luck this time, managing to drag the ace talent down into the river of energy. This act was enough to earn Janet's further admiration. At the very least, in Janet's eyes, Zheng had more luck on his side than the swordsman.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>Just as Janet had that thought, the shadow of a sword floated out from the bottom of the river. After it appeared on the water, the swordsman's head emerged. As expected, his face was no longer recognizable, having been eroded by the river's pure energy flow. The sword allowed him to survive such a place.</p>

  <p>"He can come up even after that? This guy's amazing!"</p>

  <p>Coleman couldn't help but mutter, marveling at the sight before him.</p>

  <p>Janet, Jeffrey, Hailey and the others found themselves taking a sharp breath as well, afraid that the man would just fly out of the river.</p>

  <p>But flying was prohibited in the Hall of Causality. In such a situation, it should be impossible for him to do so.</p>

  <p>The warriors in Lone's group were also surprised, but filled with some hope.</p>

  <p>But the swordsman didn't leave the river just yet. It was already extremely difficult for the sword to bring him up to the surface— it had almost used up the entirety of its strength to go against the heavens' rules.</p>

  <p>So Lone remained on the surface of the river, with eyes filled with deep hatred. Suddenly laughing wildly, he glared at Zheng as he spoke, "Brat, you've won this time... But that's just your luck! It has nothing to do with your true strength!"</p>

  <p>But Zheng only gazed at the swordsman noncommittally. In truth, Zheng was also rather curious about how Lone was able to survive in the river for so long. Even with his magical body, Zheng would be instantly eroded to death if he were to fall into it. But Lone seemed to be under the protection of some extremely powerful force.</p>

  <p>For one to withstand the power of the rules of the heavens, such a person must be a Supreme Lord or someone who surpassed the heavens.</p>

  <p>Did it have something to do with that sword in his hand?</p>

  <p>"Come on! Continue winning every battle so we can meet again. I do hope you won't resort to using your little tricks when we duel. I will surely defeat you then... Glug, glug…"</p>

  <p>Zheng could no longer hear his words clearly.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman's sword couldn't support him anymore.</p>

  <p>Rapidly, he descended into the river. Upon losing the sword's protection, his body was instantly eroded and melted away, turning into a mere strand of energy within the river.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a huge mass of Illusion Points burst out.</p>

  <p>"So many!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes lit up with surprise.</p>

  <p>With what they had seen before, they believed that the swordsman had released tens of millions of points this time.</p>

  <p>The yellow dots of light floated along the river— they floated neither up nor down, attracting the warriors' attention from both sides of the river.</p>

  <p>Indeed, they all had great interest in earning more Illusion Points, but so what? Who would dare step into the river to absorb them?</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the scene, his face fell disappointed. Such a massive amount of points were likely to be wasted there. It was a shame, he thought, that he didn't personally kill the swordsman— if he did, all the points would have flown into his body.</p>

  <p>With a shake of his head, Zheng shot out a long hook. A smile appeared on his face as he turned to the darkness. Having dealt with the most troublesome warrior, there were only seven warriors left in the other group now.</p>
