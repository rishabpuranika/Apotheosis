</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Law Power of the five elements was independent of the other Original Laws. In most ways, it was the most original Law Power of this world.</p>

  <p>Most substances were made up of the five elements.</p>

  <p>It was quite easy for any warrior to utilise the Law Power of one element since many cultivation methods were driven by the Law Power or used it to perform a specific skill.</p>

  <p>When displaying certain special martial skills, one was required to fuse two or three types of Law Power together or use them alternately in order to achieve the desired results. This skill asked for a massive amount of practice and comprehension.</p>

  <p>For most ordinary warriors, simply comprehending five different types of Law Power was already astonishing enough. But it was not so difficult for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the secret method of the Ji family demanded an absolute balance between the Law Power of the five elements, namely the power of Metal Law, Wood Law, Water Law, Fire Law, and Earth Law. This could prove to be an enormous challenge, even for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, balancing the powers of the five elements was an incomparably powerful martial skill.</p>

  <p>The Five-element Palm Print that Lucille had used was a combination of this secret method and a palm martial skill. It was a dynamic and strong skill, but since Lucille's two bodies had not merged into one, she failed to balance the powers of the five elements perfectly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's thumb flashed with a dazzling golden light. If anyone made the mistake of looking at it directly, they would feel a pricking behind their eyes. This was the power of the Metal Law.</p>

  <p>On his index finger emanated a warm and flickering flame. This was the power of the Fire Law.</p>

  <p>A heavy Mu Ning exuded from his middle finger? the power of the Earth Law.</p>

  <p>His ring finger was enveloped in watery waves? the power of the Water Law.</p>

  <p>As for his small finger, it brimmed with the green energy of life? the power of the Wood Law.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng could not balance these five Law Powers perfectly either, his fingers were still able to firmly clasp on to them because of the advantage of his chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The woman in white looked at Luo Zheng's hand and was shocked to see the powers on his fingers.</p>

  <p>Like Lucille, the woman was also a member of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Her family was as huge as the Ji family. Although she was inferior to Lucille in terms of status and talent, she still recognized that the fusion of the five elements was a secret technique unique to the Ji family.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was the most noteworthy cultivation method of the family's patriarch.</p>

  <p>This secret method, as far as she knew, was not allowed to be taught to outsiders.</p>

  <p>So how did this young man before her not only refine a Magnetic Sacred Mountain, but also learn the Ji family's secret technique?</p>

  <p>She felt more and more curious about where Luo Luo Zheng came from.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng concentrated on the powers of the five elements. These powers severely restricted each other, so it was difficult to keep control of them in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>He had no leisure time to pay attention to others, so he did not know that the woman in white was staring at him unblinkingly.</p>

  <p>'I didn't expect there to be such a strong repelling force when one gathers the five Law Powers in their palm!' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>On one hand, the five elements restricted each other? metal chopped wood; wood broke earth; earth absorbed water; water quenched fire; fire melted metal.</p>

  <p>On the other, the five elements also generated each other? metal produced water; water nourished wood; wood fed fire; fire created earth; earth bore metal.</p>

  <p>'No wonder the first step to this secret method entails balancing the powers of the five elements. If one type of Law Power is even slightly stronger than any of the others, it will affect the other Law Powers and cause a chain of mutual repulsion. Only by balancing them perfectly can they coexist in my palm, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He tried to maintain the powers on his fingers as he pushed his palm toward the Magnetic Sacred Mountain in front of him and tapped it lightly.</p>

  <p>With his touch, he wanted the Ji family's secret method to get absorbed into the mountain. Subsequently, he would draw out the magnetic power from it.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, the watery power on his ring finger flashed and pounced at the flame on his index finger. The flame extinguished automatically. In turn, it exerted influence on the power of Wood Law on his small finger...</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Due to the imbalance, the powers of the five elements on Luo Zheng's fingers dissipated one by one.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled bitterly and shook his head. This was more difficult than he had anticipated.</p>

  <p>As he retracted his hand from the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, the white-clothed woman broke the silence. "The fusion of the five elements is a powerful secret of the Ji family. It seems to me... you have only just begun to cultivate it, correct?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shot her a brief glance and gave her a small nod in reply.</p>

  <p>In the outside world, he would have tried to conceal this fact. But in the Illusion Battlefield, all warriors were at the Soul Sea Realm and very knowledgeable themselves. He could not be bothered to hide the truth from them.</p>

  <p>"I heard that even the ace talent of the Ji family spent six years comprehending it. I'm afraid it's impossible for you to achieve any progress in such a short period of time," the woman continued. In her opinion, Lucille, the renowned genius of the Ji family, was one of the top talents in the younger generation. Few people in the entire universe were more talented than her.</p>

  <p>She thought Luo Luo Zheng was in a great haste to obtain quick results, so he was using the time here to cultivate. It was a terrible mistake for warriors to be impatient for success as they practiced a new cultivation method. The woman felt it to be her responsibility to advise Luo Luo Zheng on this matter.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng only smiled and said nothing in response. Under his control, another group of five streams of chaotic energy were extracted from the chaotic sea. They flowed into his palm.</p>

  <p>Soon, five different rays of light materialized in his hand again, their stunning colors illuminating the room.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>This time, he did not try to control the powers forcefully. As expected, the powers lost their balance faster than in the last attempt.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the five different Law Powers interacted with each other and dispersed.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the woman's eyes flashed with a glint of mockery and disdain. 'Even Lucille had spent six years on this. Even if it takes you ten years to get the gist of this method, it is an achievement to be proud of!' she thought. She believed it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to master the technique so quickly.</p>

  <p>However, she knew nothing of Luo Zheng's personality and his past successes.</p>

  <p>The more challenging something was, the keener Luo Luo Zheng was to overcome it.</p>

  <p>After his second failure, Luo Luo Zheng quickly drew out five more streams of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>This time, he manipulated the arrangement of the powers.</p>

  <p>He condensed the power of Water Law on his thumb, the power of Fire Law on his small finger, and the power of Metal Law on his middle finger.</p>

  <p>In this way, the inter-restricted powers were separated from each other.</p>

  <p>Although he was still unable to achieve a perfect balance, he could feel the repulsive force between the Law Powers weaken due to this arrangement alone.</p>

  <p>Once again, he tapped the miniature mountain in front of him.</p>

  <p id="top_5">As soon as his palm touched the mountain, he began to draw out the magnetic power of the secret method.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Another palm imprint appeared on the other side of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. The shape and size of the imprint was much the same as the one left by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng failed to hold on any longer. The powers of the five elements dispersed from his hand once again.</p>

  <p>However, at the very moment that the powers departed, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with comprehension. He quickly encircled his hands around the Magnetic Sacred Mountain and caused it to rotate like a top.</p>

  <p>As his hands circled around it, a gray ray of light took shape on his palm.</p>

  <p>The light was like an imprint as it hovered on Luo Zheng's palm. It stayed for a moment before it quickly started to dissipate. In mere three seconds, the light vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>'So this is the magnetic power?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that fighting was prohibited in this room. Otherwise, he would have tried to test the might of the magnetic power. Still, even though Lucille had boasted about this powerful skill, Luo Luo Zheng did not take it seriously.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the owner of the Immortal Mansion, and the palace was equivalent to a treasure mountain. He did not care for the cultivation methods of other origins.</p>

  <p>What he did not know was that he had grossly underestimated the magnetic power.</p>

  <p>The magnetic power was a significant part of the cultivation of the Five Elements Divine Dao. To some extent, this was somewhat inferior to Luo Zheng's Emotion Closing Divine Dao, but it was still a Divine Dao in any case!</p>

  <p>As for the woman who had been observing Luo Luo Zheng from the sidelines, her mouth opened in surprise when she saw Luo Luo Zheng draw out the stream of magnetic power. Utter disbelief was written all over her face.</p>

  <p>'Hasn't he only just started to learn the secret technique of the Ji family?</p>

  <p>How is this possible?' she wondered.</p>
