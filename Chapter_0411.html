<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 411 Catching The Blade With Bare Hands </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Wang Clan that Vale came from was a big clan, though it was not one of the top clans in the Imperial Capital. In terms of fortune, it was unable to compete with the top seven noble clans. As such, the Wang Clan was unable to buy an ancient fairy weapon for Vale.</p>

  <p>In fact, Vale obtained this ancient fairy weapon when he accidentally barged into a dust-laden imperial mausoleum. To secure this Gentleman Sword, Vale surpassed the traps and tricks set inside the tomb and got chased by a band of human skeleton guards whose cultivation level could rival those at the Illuminating Soul Realm. It was also true that Vale nearly died in the imperial mausoleum.</p>

  <p>"This Gentleman Sword was the personal sword of Emperor Dillon, from the Imperial Dragon Dynasty in primitive times. Luo Luo Zheng, your body is incredibly strong and firm. It is almost as if you were built with iron and steel. But I wonder whether you can defend against my sword," Vale said as he brandished the Gentleman Sword. A string of lotuses fluttered down around him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his brow as he stared at the Gentleman Sword in Vale's hand.</p>

  <p>He never expected that Vale would have an ancient fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>Allegedly, in ancient times, weapon refiners could grasp the Heavenly Law more effortlessly than present-day refiners. Accordingly, earlier weapon refiners could easily become weapon refining masters. It was also said that weapon refining masters had an easier time when refining fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>Later, a drastic world-wide change occurred. The Heavenly Law became far more obscure, which made it more challenging for weapon refiners to refine fairy weapons. As to the nature of the change and why the Heavenly Law turned more abstruse, no one knew the answer.</p>

  <p>Therefore, ancient fairy weapons were more powerful than those produced in recent years. For instance, though the Gentleman Sword held by Vale had one fairy texture, which meant that it was a low-grade fairy weapon, its power could be at par with a medium-grade fairy weapon refined in this era!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not doubt that this medium-grade fairy weapon would cut his body? after all, his body was not stronger than a medium-grade spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>"Ancient fairy weapon? That must have cost a fortune! But are you sure that your aim is good enough to hit me?" As those remarks faded, Luo Luo Zheng took a step forward. With the full power of the Phoenix Crystal coursing through his body, Luo Luo Zheng moved at top speed, like a gust of wind!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's six demonic phantoms sprang. They hurtled toward Vale from six different directions.</p>

  <p>Seeing the six demonic phantoms rushing toward him, Vale flipped his hand, and the white lotus under his feet unfurled six petals. The petals swept against the demonic phantoms and sent them up in the air one by one. The large white lotus turned out to be another sharp offensive weapon by Vale!</p>

  <p>As the white lotus blocked the six demonic phantoms, Vale leaped gracefully before charging at Luo Luo Zheng with the Gentleman Sword clenched in his hand. "I don't know how you achieved this. At the second-grade of the nature level, you can move at such speed! Without any knowledge of sword intent, you comprehended the Sword Step. You're surely one of a kind weirdo. But as I've said, it's no use. All that you rely on is of no use!"</p>

  <p>In contrast to Luo Zheng's wicked Sword Step, Vale's movements were more elegant. Every time he took a step, a lotus blossomed under his foot. He just shuttled across the arena like a graceful swallow.</p>

  <p>Due to the Flower-Picking Pointing that Vale had performed, many pits appeared on the arena, which affected Vale's swallow-like movements.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Zheng's Sword Step allowed him to make quick and unexpected turns, the present situation was in Luo Zheng's favor.</p>

  <p>Despite all that, the distance between the two still narrowed.</p>

  <p>Right now, everyone's heart shot up to their throats. 'Will Vale kill Luo Luo Zheng?'</p>

  <p>The reason why everyone watched this match so intently was not that Luo Luo Zheng was a dark horse in this year's All Peaks Competition, or because Vale was the best of all the personal disciples. What interested the crowd the most was the grudge between Luo Luo Zheng and Vale.</p>

  <p>When the two were fighting, they kept mocking each other. Apparently, the two had already contracted enmity because of Yan. Although each disciple would go all out at the All Peaks Competition, few would fight desperately. Well, they all knew that when there is life, there is hope.</p>

  <p>It was indeed wonderful to participate in the All Peaks Competition and obtain good marks. However, they did not think that winning at the expense of losing their lives was prudent.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the battle between these two gripped in hatred was different. Both Luo Luo Zheng and Vale wanted to stomp the other and keep him subdued forever. Thus, the battle was far more violent than previous ones!</p>

  <p>Judging by the current circumstance, it seemed that each step Luo Luo Zheng took was tightly blocked by Vale, who was now at an absolute advantage. In such a case, Luo Luo Zheng had only two choices.</p>

  <p>He would have to admit defeat or be killed by Vale. Anyway, the ancient fairy weapon in Vale's hand was not designed for chopping vegetables!</p>

  <p>At this scene, Elder Xu edged towards Kenneth and asked, "Your grace, will you help Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>The All Peaks Competition was the most authoritative martial arts contest in Cloud Sect. It was devised to test the levels of its disciples.</p>

  <p>Hence, the rules of the All Peaks Competition were rigid and harsh. For example, earlier when Mack was attacking and even torturing Yehudi, as long as Yehudi did not yield, the referee would not intervene.</p>

  <p>Also, when Vale nearly demolished the entire arena with his Flower-Picking Pointing, the referee still did not step in, or suspend the match to repair the arena.</p>

  <p>In normal cases, even Kenneth would not interfere in any on-going battle during the All Peaks Competition for the sake of his own business.</p>

  <p>But Xu knew what Kenneth was thinking. From Kenneth's perspective, Luo Luo Zheng was undoubtedly a talent worth further cultivation and education.</p>

  <p>And he had given Luo Luo Zheng a lot of care and high praises, which was not Kenneth's usual style. He always seemed indifferent about the sect's affairs.</p>

  <p>At this point, Vale was wielding the Gentleman Sword and trying to kill Luo Luo Zheng. If Luo Luo Zheng were unique, it would be a huge pity to let Vale destroy him.</p>

  <p>Kenneth locked his eyes on Luo Luo Zheng, furrowed his brows, and answered, "No need! Although this kid has been chased everywhere by Vale, do you see any trace of panic on his face? I guess this kid has a card under his sleeve!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xu turned toward Luo Luo Zheng. He found that Luo Luo Zheng was still very composed.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was zigzagging with his peculiar Sword Step and seemed quite unflustered.</p>

  <p>'But that only proves that Luo Luo Zheng is a sedate guy who can stay calm when in peril. However, it doesn't mean Luo Luo Zheng has no fear of Vale's sword!' In Elder Xu's opinion, Luo Luo Zheng was a spent arrow, and he had no more chances to strike back. 'If no one interferes in the match, in perhaps a few minutes, Luo Luo Zheng will be beheaded by Vale.</p>

  <p>But based on the leader's behavior, it seems that he has no intention to come forward. If so, what else can an elder like I say?'</p>

  <p>At this moment, Vale was inching closer and closer to Luo Luo Zheng. When the distance was reduced to a certain degree, Vale's graceful figure landed on the ground again. A lotus bloomed after he lightly touched the earth with his toe. At the same time, the Gentleman Sword in his hand swung toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This attack was not directed at any of Luo Zheng's vital parts. It seemed as though Vale was aiming for one of Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>The power of this ancient fairy weapon was extremely overbearing.</p>

  <p>Although the domineering air dispersed from the Gentleman Sword was not commensurate to the appearance of the sword, it would not affect its power. An ancient fairy weapon could not only slice clean through iron as though it were mud, but also spiritual weapons, which would be as easy as dicing vegetables.</p>

  <p>Predictably, even if Luo Zheng's body could match that of a spiritual weapon, he would still be hacked in half when the sword hit him.</p>

  <p>Just as Vale launched this attack, Luo Luo Zheng slid sideways as if he had a pair of eyes on the back side of his head. The movement allowed Luo Luo Zheng to shift his shoulder an inch away, thus helping him to dodge the attack successfully.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a sly smile surfaced on Luo Zheng's face. He turned abruptly to face Vale head-on. Now, the two were very close to each other.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death!" It was beyond Vale's expectations that Luo Luo Zheng would dare to fight him face-to-face. Vale flicked his wrist and directed the Gentleman Sword sideways to land another attack on Luo Luo Zheng. Without hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng stretched his hands and reached for the sword.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng doesn't want his hands anymore, does he? Is he going to block the blade with his bare hands? Is he out of his mind?"</p>

  <p>"How could a man catch Vale's sword with his hands? I'm positive that Luo Luo Zheng will lose his hands!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng was attempting to block Vale's sword with his hands, many shook their heads. Confronting a blade with bare hands was not profound Kung Fu. Many people could do it. However, there were many preconditions. For example, their strength must be stronger than that of their opponents, which would ensure that they could stop the sword with their palms.</p>

  <p>Since Vale was more powerful than Luo Luo Zheng, and the sword that he was holding was an ancient fairy weapon, Luo Zheng's attempt was daring to the point of being considered reckless. Many in the audience were already picturing the bloody scene of Luo Zheng's hands being chopped off.</p>

  <p>But the scene the crowd imagined did not occur.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng did not exactly catch the blade with his bare hands!</p>

  <p>Facing the attack of the ancient fairy weapon, Luo Luo Zheng, of course, was not so stupid that he would really catch it with bare hands. He had no intention of losing his hands!</p>

  <p>He suddenly balled his right hand into a fist, took a turn, and punched the Gentleman Sword from the side.</p>

  <p>'I can't launch a frontal attack on the ancient fairy weapon with my body.</p>

  <p>But I can smash the side of the sword!'</p>

  <p>At Luo Zheng's counterstrike, a trace of sneer emerged on Vale's face. He found this trick by Luo Luo Zheng very boring. 'Anyway, inferior people will always be weak. Even when they are cornered, they can't think of a decent counterattack. Their only option is to resort to dull tricks!'</p>

  <p>'It's easy to undo Luo Zheng's little trick. All I need to do is to draw the sword along the force of his punch, and then, swing at him once more. I aimed for Luo Zheng's left shoulder, but this time, I will target his right shoulder instead. Anyway, his little trick will not make a difference.'</p>

  <p>But just as Luo Zheng's fist made contact with his sword, Vale's expression changed radically!</p>

  <p>Vibration rolled out of Luo Zheng's fist. When this vibration flowed through the sword and spread to Vale's hand, Vale lost his grip and nearly let the Gentleman Sword fly out of his hand!</p>
