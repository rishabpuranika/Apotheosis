<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1273 Dark And Light Energies </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that the girls were worried about him. So he looked at them, assuring them with confidence, "Trust me. I'll be okay!"</p>

  <p>The girls showed concerns of varying degrees, but since Luo Zheng had already made his decision, how could they possibly interfere?</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was what the world was like. In the world of martial artists, except for Mu Ning who had grown up well-protected, everyone had to encounter dangerous situations on their path of pursuing marital arts.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had also experienced a few life and death situations. And Luo Zheng had saved Ning Yudie from the jaws of death not long ago.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had set foot on the True Path, Ning Yudie said, "Luo Zheng has a great destiny, and I believe he will pass successfully."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie hadn't gone overseas with Luo Zheng and she had no idea what kind of danger Luo Zheng had encountered during his several trips. But she was very confident about Zheng's strength and luck.</p>

  <p>Just after Luo Zheng had set foot on the True Path, mists began to rise from either side of this ridge. There were two kinds of mists, each of a different color. The mist on Zheng's left was black, while the mist on his right was white.</p>

  <p>"These mists are very strange," Luo Zheng muttered, a strange feeling overcoming him at the sight of these mists. He felt like they could turn into everything in the world.</p>

  <p>Just as a trace of doubt arose in Zheng's heart, Saul's voice floated into his ears, "These are Dark and Light energies. The first owner of the fairy palace had worked them out. You need to be careful."</p>

  <p>At the beginning of heaven and earth, everything was in primordial chaos. It was infinity. This infinity gave birth to the supreme ultimate that then produced two modes. The two modes represented two contrary forces and they generated the four images. The four images included east, south, west and north and the four images gave birth to the eight diagrams. The eight diagrams multiplied to become sixty-four diagrams and they continued to multiply themselves. There was no end to it!</p>

  <p>If the Dark and Light energies continued to develop, it was likely that they would lead to the origin of the entire world. Luo Zheng was unable to figure out the mysteries within them.</p>

  <p>But he didn't need to know anything about them at the current stage.</p>

  <p>What he needed to do was to continuously advance on this True Path.</p>

  <p>As he thought this, Luo Zheng sped up and shot forward like a shuttle.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light energies turned into strange flowers and plants as they rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression did not change and a long sword suddenly appeared in his hand. He swung the long sword to the left and unleashed sharp sword intents. He then spun the sword to the right and grasped the sword with one hand. The sword intents soon wrapped around Luo Zheng to protect him.</p>

  <p>Rays of light from the sharp sword whirled in the air, and in an instant, the strange flowers and plants formed by the Dark and Light energies were ground to dust. They returned to their original forms and became black and white mists, before condensing into different strange plants that continued to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"They are not difficult to deal with," Luo Zheng muttered, dropping his guard.</p>

  <p>He increased his speed tremendously with the protection of the sword intents. As he flew forward, he turned to look back and found that everything behind him had actually disappeared. Mu Ning, Ning Yudie, and Mu Ning were shrouded in the black and white mists. He traversed the narrow path alone, and loneliness suddenly arose in his heart.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued to charge forward, the things that the Dark and Night energies transformed into varied. This time, they transformed into a large number of small insects of different species, of which Luo Zheng could recognize only a few, like butterflies, dragonflies, and beetles. Most of these insects were strange to look and they had hateful countenances.</p>

  <p>The sword intents whirled around and smashed the insects into pulp and powder.</p>

  <p>The insects multiplied in size as more and more of them swarmed out.</p>

  <p>Some were even the size of a fist. The thick shells covering their bodies were so hard that Luo Zheng had to put in a lot of effort to cut them to pieces even with his top-grade sacred weapon. The noise of the sword intents colliding with the shells filled the place.</p>

  <p>But they were still unable to stop Luo Zheng despite there being so many of them. His speed only increased!</p>

  <p>As he dashed forward, these insects gradually disappeared and were replaced by scores of reptiles like lizards and snakes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was suddenly struck by a thought. 'This True Path... It seems to have been arranged in accordance with the evolution of living beings!'</p>

  <p>Creatures throughout the universe had not appeared out of thin air. Every species came into existence, reproduced and gave birth to new generations. Through constant evolution, they would erase their weak points, improve on their strengths, and become stronger.</p>

  <p>It was the survival of the fittest in natural selection.</p>

  <p>A lot of the creatures that came at Luo Zheng were foreign to him. Some had probably already become extinct in this world, while some others had evolved into even more powerful races.</p>

  <p>'But why is the True Path set up like this?' Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish..."</p>

  <p>On both sides of the True Path, Dark and Light energies kept transforming into different colored reptiles of different sizes, and continued to move towards Luo Zheng. Just like the insects and plants, these low level creatures posed no threat to Luo Zheng. He continued to move as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>But the moment he had walked past this area, the difficulty of advancing on the True Path suddenly increased.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light energies began to transform into ferocious beasts.</p>

  <p>There were lions, tigers, leopards, mastiffs, and so many more that Luo Zheng couldn't even recognize.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" But Luo Zheng remained calm. Any ferocious beast that dared approach him would be easily killed.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had killed all these ferocious beasts, primates like monkeys, gorillas, baboons, and a few human-like beings began to appear on the True Path.</p>

  <p>The attacks from these primates were even weaker than those from the ferocious beasts. They held sticks in their hands, and threw stones at Luo Zheng. They even used fire. It was extremely primitive, but Luo Zheng was clear that all human-like creatures like the ogres, Demon Night members, and the Giants could develop into what they were today only because of the wisdom they had activated in the ancient time.</p>

  <p>But who had bestowed such wisdom to them?</p>

  <p>He had no idea. All he knew was that he had to continue killing them.</p>

  <p>The primates' attacks were futile.</p>

  <p>They weren't able to harm Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Under the frenzied slaughter, these primates gradually disappeared. But after that, more human-like beings appeared one after another! They were taller.</p>

  <p>"Humans? But they don't look exactly like humans!"</p>

  <p>These creatures looked very similar to humans, but when Luo Zheng looked closer, he knew it was not the case.</p>

  <p>They were taller than humans, and their every muscle and bone was perfectly in position. They had sharp ears like those of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Their pupils and skin resembled those of the ogres. They also had dark green scales covering their back, and although these scales weren't very beautiful, they could protect them from attacks they couldn't see.</p>

  <p>In addition to their strength, Luo Zheng could feel a perfect Mu Ning emanating from their bodies. What kind of race was this? Why was there such a perfect race? Luo Zheng looked at them curiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had previously considered the Demon Night to be the most perfect race. They were born nature creatures, with pure and flawless bodies.</p>

  <p>But they also had some drawbacks. They were quite weak at reproduction and increasing their population. There were many talents in their race, but their population was still small and the number of powerful masters and talents they had was far smaller than that in the human race. Each race had their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

  <p>The creatures standing in front of Luo Zheng made him feel strange. This race seemed to be a perfect combination of all the strong points of many different races. But why hadn't Luo Zheng heard of this race before?</p>

  <p>Those perfect creatures charged towards Luo Zheng, taking advantage of the time he was spending pondering over his doubts.</p>

  <p>They seemed to have grasped some crucial battle techniques as they directly attacked Zheng's vitals.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grunted but recovered to throw a punch towards one of them. He didn't use the power of the dragon scales. He was still in the early stage of the True Path so he thought he didn't need a lot of strength. Luo Zheng was confident that he could bring a person down with one punch.</p>

  <p>But as Zheng's punch was about to hit him, the one standing in the lead suddenly curled up, reducing the impact he had to suffer. His bones began to twist in an astonishing way that no normal person could have done. He looked miserable as he rolled on the ground in pain. His shattered body began to recover a while later.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked as he saw this.</p>

  <p>The people of this race gave Luo Zheng the impression that they were perfect beings, but they had never cultivated martial arts. Even though their bodies were pure, they were only nature creatures.</p>

  <p>The punch that Luo Zheng had thrown was very powerful. Even a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm would get killed immediately. A nature creature was no match at all.</p>

  <p>Yet this guy had offset more than half the power in Zheng's strike by relying on his flexible body. More surprisingly, he had actually managed to get to his feet unscathed.</p>

  <p>How did he do it?</p>
