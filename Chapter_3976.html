<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The man's body was dark in color. Although the people around him could not see his appearance clearly, his eight-foot-tall figure gave away that he was Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Cough, cough, cough..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng coughed violently and spat out a black mass.</p>

  <p>He coughed up so much it took him a long time to recover.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sawyer and Thurston still couldn't believe and wondered how he had escaped.</p>

  <p>After all, such a thing never happened before.</p>

  <p>The only unexpected thing that happened was that the Cyan Bone Ghosts' bodies were too powerful and remained intact for a long while in the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Cyan Bone Ghosts, who were still alive after being absorbed, wanted to escape, but Sawyer quickly put Thurston's hand down, so they failed to get out.</p>

  <p>However, the situation was completely different this time.</p>

  <p>Usually, they controlled the Black Sun, but now it was the Black Sun that controlled them. The two brothers never imagined that such a thing would happen.</p>

  <p>"He got out of the Black Sun by force. What kind of strength does it need?"</p>

  <p>In shock, Thurston looked at Zheng, who was coughing.</p>

  <p>The two brothers had controlled the Black Sun for a long time, and during that period, they thoroughly studied it.</p>

  <p>According to their study, someone unknown had created the Black Sun. It should be a remarkably perfect prison.</p>

  <p>Anyone who got locked up inside it could not get out unless both Sawyer and Thurston helped them.</p>

  <p>From the design point of view, the Black Sun was perfect.</p>

  <p>Yet, today, someone broke this perfect philosophy and got out of it.</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for? Swallow him again! I don't believe he can escape a second time!"</p>

  <p>Pearson quickly jumped up, and the spider threads swerved towards the opposite direction and shrouded Zheng.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng, who was still in a fit of violent coughs, suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>Then in a bent position, he turned his head and stared at Pearson.</p>

  <p>His whole body was pitch black, but his eyeballs were a little white. His bright and sharp eyes were like arrows that were ready to leave the bowstring any time, which unnerved Pearson and slightly weakened his momentum.</p>

  <p>The moment Pearson paused for a bit, Zheng fiercely pounced forward with his hands on the ground. Then, he ran like a cheetah for two steps and finally grabbed Pearson by the neck.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Pearson's head collided against the ground as Zheng seized his neck and firmly pressed his body down.</p>

  <p>Whap!</p>

  <p>Afterward, Zheng pushed his body to make a ditch on the ground, and then raised a fist to punch him.</p>

  <p>If Zheng punched him, he would surely die.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng's fist touched the tip of his nose, his head and body suddenly turned into thin spider threads!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...</p>

  <p>His threads had a sealing effect and could perfectly close off the bloodline power.</p>

  <p>Zheng had previously been caught off guard, and the ancestry-level bloodline could not help him, so he got trapped inside the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>Hiss, hiss, hiss...</p>

  <p>After Pearson's threads wrapped tightly around Zheng, they continued to weave until they turned into Pearson's head. "What are you waiting for?"</p>

  <p>Pearson angrily yelled at Sawyer and Thurston.</p>

  <p>The three of them cooperated closely. When faced with a tough opponent, Pearson subdued their target with his threads, and then Sawyer and Thurston used the Black Sun to suck in the target.</p>

  <p>Once the Black Sun had sucked in the target, Pearson's spider threads fell off the target's body to prevent Pearson from being sucked into it.</p>

  <p>The three of them always worked together closely and tacitly, almost without any communication.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Sawyer and Thurston just stood still.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had already escaped from the Black Sun once, he could escape from it again.</p>

  <p>However, all the Eternal Realm Hunters were people who lived on the verge of death. They couldn't possibly avoid trying just because it was hard for the Black Sun to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>The real reason they stopped was because of King Ieuan's words during the previous conversation.</p>

  <p>These humans were the current civilization in the chaos.</p>

  <p>They were the hope of completing the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>Based on the actions of the Knotting race in the past, they should be friends of Knotting race and be the ones who the Knotting race supported.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the powers Zheng had exhibited shocked them. Someone like him indeed deserved to be hunted by the Element Spirit Civilization which offered a generous bounty to whoever caught him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he could also possibly complete the Finale Way. "Do something!" Pearson continued to shout.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with... your companions?"</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out his hand and grabbed Pearson's head. With a gentle pinch, Pearson's head immediately turned into countless spider threads.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to kill Pearson.</p>

  <p>When Zheng got trapped in the Black Sun, he did not hear conversation outside. Thus, he did not know the reason.</p>

  <p>However, Pearson's two companions suddenly hesitated, which naturally gave him a chance.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng was about to attack the twins, King Ieuan suddenly said,</p>

  <p>"Zheng, they are not enemies. I think you all have the same stand! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at King Ieuan in confusion. "If you really plan to complete the Finale Way, I think we are indeed not enemies," said Sawyer.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng quickly understood Sawyer's words.</p>

  <p>There were very few creatures on Other Shore who still insisted on the Finale Way, and most of the others paid allegiance to the Element Spirit Civilization or had died.</p>

  <p>But these people were indeed allies.</p>

  <p>Hiss, hiss, hiss...</p>

  <p>The spider threads slipped down from Zheng's body and quickly turned into Pearson's body.</p>

  <p>"Are you idiots?!" Pearson said in exasperation.</p>

  <p>From the beginning to the end, he didn't believe a single word from King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>The two brothers from the Knotting race were too naive. They still couldn't forget about the Finale Way, and now they were fooled by a few words.</p>

  <p>Then again, Pearson didn't have a powerful combat strength. If the two brothers did not want to cooperate, then he definitely could not fight Zheng head-on.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that there were several Eternal Realm warriors with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, it's true that the Element Spirit Civilization tries to kill them,"</p>

  <p>Sawyer confirmed.</p>

  <p>If Pear Hill, which the Snake Goddess had mentioned, could deal with the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization, then Sawyer and Thurston were willing to side with them unconditionally!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a barrage of loud footsteps came from not far away.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>A group of creatures, half human and half horse, charged towards them at an exceptionally fast speed. "It's the Sacred Horse race!" Fuxi exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Horse race might not be the best in the Grand Pure Realm, but they were the most challenging race to deal with.</p>

  <p>They moved too fast that no one could catch up with them or escape from them. They fought their opponents to death.</p>

  <p>Because the Eternal Realm Hunters had delayed Zheng for such a long time, he and the others encountered the members of the Sacred Horse race.</p>

  <p>"I hope you two won't get me into trouble!" Pearson snorted coldly.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he turned around and flicked his finger. Then, he transformed into extraordinarily thin spider threads that quietly spread out on the ground.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>The members of the Sacred Horse race continued to get closer. In a blink, they finally arrived.</p>

  <p>The leader of the group was thirty feet tall and carried a spear full of thorns on his shoulder. He shouted excitedly, "How cooperative of you! Do you wait for us here?"</p>
