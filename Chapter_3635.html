<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3635 Powerful Defense </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The countless Jin Wu formed a black ocean as they raced towards the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>When the mass of crows were within twenty miles of the Sky Net, they broke their original formation and swarmed together to move in one direction. Towards the Mountain Sea Pass!</p>

  <p>The moment they did so though, the Sky Net also began to shift and change.</p>

  <p>It had originally been traversing across the southwest, but now it had begun to fold and roll away from the Mountain Sea Pass to advance on the mass of Jin Wu. It looked to be attempting to encircle them!</p>

  <p>As it began to roll inwards on either side, the generals and soldiers of the Battle Rage Pass on the left, and those of the Heaven Wind Pass on the right, began to converge on the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Other generals and soldiers from the six arrays and eleven passes, excluding those in the Vastness Array and the Mountain Sea Pass, advanced forward along the sides of the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the battalion of Jin Wu grew closer, they scattered, putting more and more distance between each of them.</p>

  <p>In their reformation, they could now see a smaller group of Corpse Spirit Jin Wu amongst them.</p>

  <p>At the sight of about 100 Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, the warriors of the seven arrays of the Taiyi Heaven Palace emerged grim-faced.</p>

  <p>"The Jin Wu... They are absolutely insane!"</p>

  <p>"I can't believe Emperor Di Jun has released the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu..."</p>

  <p>"They are the basis of their race. They truly plan to wage a mighty battle against the Taiyi Heaven Palace."</p>

  <p>In the past, the two factions had a peaceful relationship. They had allied themselves, and their leaders had known one another quite well.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt at all that the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were incredibly powerful, but they rarely ever fought unless their race found themselves faced with the crisis of possible extinction. So the others were boggled as to why they showed up now. They were determined to destroy the Taiyi Heaven Palace!</p>

  <p>Phoenix's lips stretched into a charming smile as she sat at the top.</p>

  <p>There were countless humans gathering like ants behind the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>As far as Phoenix was concerned, apart from the masters of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the soldiers at the Other Shore Realm were the same as these brainless Jin Wu. They were all meaningless and just numbers to her.</p>

  <p>Their numbers would dwindle and disappear, their bodies turning to cheap dust and being swept away with the wind into the sky, forever lost.</p>

  <p>Such was the terrible, pathetic lives of the weak.</p>

  <p>"Begin the first wave of attacks."</p>

  <p>Phoenix stretched her hands out slightly in front of her.</p>

  <p>A gentle glow began to emanate from her shoulders, and turned into a ray of golden light as it wrapped along her arms. The glow was nearly blinding as it stretched past her wrists and towards her fingertips.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Once the golden light met her fingertips, it bloomed and spread away from her fingers.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu, even the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu for all their power, did not possess intelligence. They were under the control of the Divine Lair, which was under the command of Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Since Emperor Di Jun was nowhere to be found, they were controlled by Phoenix in this war.</p>

  <p>As the light spread farther from her fingertips, the eyes of the many Jin Wu glowed with the simple message-attack.</p>

  <p>Quack! Quack! Quack!</p>

  <p>As one, they rushed to the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>In response, Luo Zheng and the other Taiyi Generals entered the positions of the array once again.</p>

  <p>Sinclair stood at the forefront, watching impassively as the Jin Wu charged forward. Without a single thought, he roared, "Soldiers of the Mountain Sea Pass, attack!"</p>

  <p>He had used much strength behind the command, so much so, that it had drowned out the cry of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>"Soldiers of the Battle Rage Pass, attack!"</p>

  <p>"Soldiers of the Heaven Wind Pass..."</p>

  <p>All Taiyi Generals in the remaining eleven passes responded in kind in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards and the warriors at the Other Shore Realm who were stationed in the passes activated their Other Shore Tokens in a flash and were there to greet the first attacks of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>In a battle of this magnitude, Luo Zheng found it hard to concentrate and determine those he should protect.</p>

  <p>He sat upright at his position, eyes closed. There was a constant energy pulsing from his body, and into the space around him.</p>

  <p>He had only used 128 transparent long swords earlier; however, as he continued to draw out the Other Shore Power now, the number of swords increased exponentially.</p>

  <p>Each sword contained ten Jun of force, and this time he had drawn out sixteen thousand Jun of force!</p>

  <p>The sight of more than 1, 000 flying swords nearly made Basil's eyes pop out of their sockets.</p>

  <p>Not to mention the difficulty of controlling the swords, the amount of force it took to shape them was no laughing matter. What incredible Other Shore Tokens had Luo Zheng fused with?</p>

  <p>Now was not the time to question him though. After watching the spectacle for a long moment, Basil held his long sword in the air and made a wide arc towards the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>"Rise!"</p>

  <p>Sixteen hundred flying swords spiraled up as if they were jubilant, dancing birds, and entangled with each other before rushing into the sky.</p>

  <p>Every time a sword pierced through a Sun Crow, a spray of blood would burst from the bird in a cloud of red mist. The weapons were efficient and quick with ridding the sky of the creatures. They had at least cleaned up a good portion of them on the front line.</p>

  <p>"It's that human brat again!"</p>

  <p>Queenie glared at the swords, her eyes glinting dangerously and promising death. "Who will destroy the positions of the array with me?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"I will!"</p>

  <p>"Queenie, allow us to do it together!"</p>

  <p>Two demon women cried in response.</p>

  <p>It seemed Phoenix's goal was not to destroy the Mountain Sea Pass, but the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>The task of demolishing the Mountain Sea Pass was assigned to the demon women of the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>A sharp swishing noise cut through the air.</p>

  <p>Queenie swiftly grabbed the air before her, taking hold of the Invisibility Curtain. With a nonchalant wave of her hand, the five-colored light curtain enveloped three Corpse Spirit Jin Wu. They disappeared instantaneously.</p>

  <p>The size of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu took up much space though, so their sudden disappearance easily attracted Luo Zheng's attention.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hands beside him, drawing out some of the flying swords and sent them hurting towards the seemingly empty air.</p>

  <p>As they neared the space, there were several harsh clanking sounds.</p>

  <p>The swords had encountered some kind of resistance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression did not change despite his irritation. The ten Jun of force could obviously easily kill the fragile Jin Wu, but this was different.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were massive, and not ordinary in any way.</p>

  <p>"Assemble!"</p>

  <p>Swords cut through the air with loud whooshing noises.</p>

  <p>The swords were starting to merge, and as they combined they could contain more and more strength.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand Jun of force!" Luo Zheng called.</p>

  <p>One of the swords finally pierced through the false void.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there was another harsh, metallic clang.</p>

  <p>The sword had met yet another barrier, and spun away from the void.</p>

  <p>There was a brief flicker of surprise on Luo Zheng's face. The defensive power of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu far exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand Jun of force!" he snarled.</p>

  <p>The spiraling sword corrected itself, and once more zipped towards the void at alarming speed.</p>

  <p>Another sharp clang.</p>

  <p>The sound echoed in his ears as the sword spun away erratically.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen thousand Jun of force!" he yelled, his voice shaking.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stopped releasing power to a majority of flying swords, and then forced all the power into a long sword and sent it towards the void once more.</p>

  <p>A crack was heard.</p>

  <p>The sword had finally pierced through an object in the void, but it seemed to have only made it half a foot.</p>

  <p>Although he was elated that the sword had gotten through, he was still shocked to learn it didn't go any farther. With a clenched fist, he released the power within the sword. "How troublesome..." he grumbled to himself.</p>

  <p>The power of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu was far beyond his expectations.</p>

  <p>"How troublesome is it, exactly?" Basil asked in confusion. He had heard Luo Zheng's softly spoken words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pointed ahead and said, "Take a look."</p>

  <p>The three Corpse Spirit Jin Wu that had been hiding were now slowly descending as the Invisibility Curtain was taken away by Queenie. The mouths of the now visible massive creatures were alight with blue flames.</p>
