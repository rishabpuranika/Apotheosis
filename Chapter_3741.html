<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue couldn't help but sigh dejectedly. "If it's already awfully cold at the entrance, how much colder will it be above? I can't imagine what that'll be like," she said while shivering slightly.</p>

  <p>However, Phoenix merely shrugged indifferently. "To be honest, this is not the coldest place yet. You will know when you get up there!"</p>

  <p>"Really? But it's already freezing cold in here. Is this really how we will get up there?" Luo Zheng looked at her questioningly.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that if they climbed to the upper ice field without any preparation, even Luo Zheng would be frozen.</p>

  <p>Phoenix shook her head. "What? Of course not!" She seemed like she had some sort of trick up her sleeve.</p>

  <p>She stretched out her arm for them to see. As they looked at it, a small ring instantly appeared on her wrist. Obviously, this ring was the Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..." It began to vibrate slightly.</p>

  <p>As the ring emitted a flash of light, a circular shield appeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>"This is the Divine Fire Shield. It is a treasure forged by the fire spirit of the Element Spirit race. Under the protection of this shield, we can move safely around the area above," explained Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Emperor Ji had obtained a great deal of benefits from the Element Spirit race when he joined them.</p>

  <p>He didn't seem to need this Divine Fire Shield. Therefore, he gave it to Phoenix instead. It was a good thing he did because this would be a great help in crossing the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>Phoenix began floating towards Luo Zheng. As soon as she passed by him, she had released the divine flames of the Jin Wu on her fingertips.</p>

  <p>The divine flames started flowing upward and all over the Divine Fire Shield. The heat coming from the entirety of the shield radiated towards them and gave them warmth.</p>

  <p>The temperature of the Divine Fire Shield itself was not that high. However, it was able to control the temperature within a certain range.</p>

  <p>"Stay close to me. We'll climb up quickly! Get ready. Here we go!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix said.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Under the protection of the Divine Fire Shield, the three of them dashed upward together.</p>

  <p>They broke through the ice-cold hole that was now starting to freeze over.</p>

  <p>After a while, the trio finally arrived at the upper ice field. They made it with almost no problem at all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh... Suddenly they heard a loud swishing sound.</p>

  <p>They encountered a fierce cold wind that blew over them. It was quite powerful and should not be taken lightly. It almost overturned the Divine Fire Shield.</p>

  <p>"Hold on!" Phoenix's facial expression changed.</p>

  <p>If the Divine Fire Shield was blown away by this monstrous wind, their fate would be sealed. They could already imagine getting frozen to death in this icy wasteland.</p>

  <p>Without second thought, Luo Zheng immediately clasped the Divine Fire Shield in his hands with lightning speed. He gripped it as tightly as he could. No matter how hard the cold wind blew, the Divine Fire Shield did not budge at all. It remained covering the three of them!</p>

  <p>Phoenix breathed a sigh of relief. If Luo Zheng hadn't reacted quickly, the shield would have overturned. "Let's keep moving forward!" She motioned them to follow her. "Over there on the left, you can see the line that marks the end of the ice field. As long as we continue to walk along the line, we should be on the right way... "</p>

  <p>The area of Blooming Jade Stage was quite immense.</p>

  <p>Even though the path Phoenix had chosen was considered relatively safe, it still was not that easy to cross.</p>

  <p>The only thing they encountered in the boundless ice field was the cold bitter wind that blew hard. Other than the vast blue and white ice field, they couldn't see anything else. Not even a single snowflake was in sight.</p>

  <p>Every five minutes, the red light on the Divine Fire Shield would start to dim. In addition to that, the temperature under the shield would also plummet. Every time this would happen, Phoenix would send a divine flame toward the Divine Fire Shield with just a slight flick of her finger.</p>

  <p>The light of the Divine Fire Shield would once again become bright.</p>

  <p>A few hours had already passed since the three of them had made their way above the ice field. However, all they could see in front of them was just pure white space. They couldn't see the way in front of them or the way they had passed.</p>

  <p>"We can't just keep going on like this. It's too slow and we're wasting too much time already," Luo Zheng said impatiently. "Can't we just fly over?"</p>

  <p>He asked because he knew Phoenix was able to fly. However, she merely shook her head when she heard Luo Zheng's suggestion. "The situation on the ice field is completely different from what you actually see. There are some extremely cold and turbulent currents up in the air that are invisible. If we ever get caught up in those currents, even the Divine Fire Shield won't be able to protect us."</p>

  <p>Seeing the serious look on Phoenix's face, Luo Zheng just gave up on that idea.</p>

  <p>All he could do now was to keep moving forward under the shield.</p>

  <p>After they had walked for another sixteen hours, the cold wind gradually stopped.</p>

  <p>Without the sound of the wind, the place was so quiet. It was such a deafening silence.</p>

  <p>"The cold wind has stopped blowing?" Luo Zheng noticed this immediately. He looked around him through the shield. He couldn't feel the wind anymore.</p>

  <p>Phoenix merely shrugged. "Well, that's because the temperature is much lower here than where we were before."</p>

  <p>It was common knowledge that as the temperature reached an extremely low point, any kind of energy would become almost stagnant. The cold wind on the ice field was also considered as a powerful energy.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Luo Zheng! Look! What's that over there?" Li Bianxue had been quietly observing the area around them all along.</p>

  <p>She already knew that it would be very cold on the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>However, never in her dreams did she think that the upper ice field would be like this.</p>

  <p>Northwest of their current location, they saw a portion of the ice field sinking for a few dozen feet. It seemed like there was nothing in that area at all. However, they felt that this zone exuded a particularly huge pressure.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the area that Li Bianxue pointed out. Then, his facial expression was filled with utter curiosity. Instinctively, he grabbed the Divine Fire Shield and tried to move towards that area.</p>

  <p>"No, wait! Don't go there!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix hurriedly pulled the Divine Fire Shield. She said, "That's a Cold Prison. Don't go there!"</p>

  <p>"A Cold Prison? What is that?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows. He had never heard of that before.</p>

  <p>Phoenix nodded. "The temperature in there is much lower than that of where we are standing right now. That makes it the third coldest place on the entire Other Shore." She began discharging a divine flame of the Jin Wu upon her fingertips and turned it into a small flame arrow. She shot the flame arrow made of incredibly condensed heat towards the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! It soared directly towards the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, the flame arrow suddenly stopped the moment it entered the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>The arrow seemed like it was hovering steadily and slowly. Even the flame on it was flickering very slowly as well.</p>

  <p>"The flame arrow looks oddly peculiar," mumbled Luo Zheng as he stared at the arrow.</p>

  <p>He thought that if the "Cold Prison" was truly extremely cold, then the flame arrow should have been extinguished right away.</p>

  <p>In this case, the flame didn't go out immediately. Instead, it actually looked like it was burning really slowly.</p>

  <p>"Believe it or not, the flame arrow has already been extinguished," explained Phoenix. "But due to the extremely low temperature of the Cold Prison, time has been oddly distorted inside. The flame arrow that you see floating slowly right now is merely a mirage."</p>

  <p>Whenever something had reached an extreme level, it was usually enough to render some parts of the basic rules ineffective.</p>

  <p>As the coldness reached its absolute limit, the properties of many things would also change.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle!"</p>

  <p>After the flame arrow floated for a few seconds, it suddenly burned brightly.</p>

  <p>In a split second, the entire Cold Prison was filled with firelight.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the firelight just flashed quickly and disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>The moment the firelight illuminated the Cold Prison, Luo Zheng noticed some light dots with strange shapes that appeared inside it. Those light dots were randomly distributed and they looked very similar to the light dots in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"So those light dots are..."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to ask, Phoenix began to explain. "So far, we still don't know what those light dots are. But I have heard from Emperor Ji that there are some things imprisoned here. That is why these areas on the ice field are called 'Cold Prisons'."</p>

  <p>Simply put, the Cold Prisons on Stage Thirty actually imprisoned the creatures from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>It was too bad that Luo Nian had been left in the Deleting Space. If he was here, Luo Zheng would be able to ask him to tell what these light dots were.</p>

  <p>Driven by his absolute curiosity, Luo Zheng also flicked a few flames towards the Cold Prison. He observed them carefully just as he did earlier.</p>

  <p>As soon as the flames entered the Cold Prison, they all floated slowly like Phoenix's flame arrow. Then with a flash of firelight, they disappeared too.</p>

  <p>After trying several more times, Luo Zheng continued to move forward under the Divine Fire Shield.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he discovered that there were Cold Prisons everywhere on the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>The densely packed Cold Prisons looked like they were holes that had been dug by worms. They had cut the originally sleek ice surface into many parts.</p>
