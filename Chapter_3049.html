<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back in the Sword Light Palace, Athemar had known about Zheng's talents and was determined to introduce him to the Oneness Sky Palace. Besides, he was the only one who could save Winchell's son. He was important, in any way.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he maintained the idea that the Oneness Sky Palace wouldn't simply watch him die.</p>

  <p>A young man had prevented Galen from attacking him, and once he'd passed the Sword Wall, Monica stayed close by in order to give him a few hints.</p>

  <p>Zheng was already confused at this point. If the two weren't sent by the Origin Mountain, then they were most likely instructed by Athemar. But why would they do something like that?</p>

  <p>"I'm just a nobody. Don't put me on the spot," Monica begged as she tugged at Zheng's arm, pulling him.</p>

  <p>'Let me see what tricks you have up your sleeve, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He finally made the decision to compromise on this one. It wasn't for or about himself, but for the sake of many disciples who followed him diligently.</p>

  <p>Monica cautiously narrowed the area occupied by her flag. She raised her eyes toward the somber sky and said, "It's getting dark. Hurry up, please."</p>

  <p>With a single swing of his muscular arm, Zheng stabbed the flagpole solidly into the ground.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As soon as the flagpole collided with the earth, a faint light spread outward, creeping and covering an area of over a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>The disciples willfully followed Zheng into the designated area.</p>

  <p>In comparison to the areas created by others, Zheng's area was obviously much too small for more than a hundred disciples, yet they had no other choice but to make do with it, at least for now.</p>

  <p>Moments after Zheng inserted his flagpole, darkness fell. Now, faint starlight could be seen rising suddenly in the distance from the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The starlight appeared to split repeatedly. In just a few minutes, tons of stars covered every inch of the sky.</p>

  <p>Every single star looked to be about the same size and the distance between them was relatively the same, too. They were as orderly as soldiers in an array, and they appeared quite beautiful, to say the least.</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful starry sky!" one of the disciples exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What are these stars used for?"</p>

  <p>No one replied. Nothing but silence.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and the other disciples had all raised their heads toward the sky. If he had chosen to stay permanently in the Excellence City, he would have never witnessed such a scene. The Source World was so vast. The easiest way to describe the warriors located there was they were like frogs at the bottom of a well. All they could only see was a tiny patch of sky directly above them.</p>

  <p>Although Kenelm had nearly been killed on several different occasions on the way over, he still thought it had all been worthwhile.</p>

  <p>"What are all these stars for?" Beldene asked, still staring up at the sky.</p>

  <p>"You'll soon find out," replied a woman in Monica's flag area, smiling sweetly to the newly arrived disciples.</p>

  <p>With everyone's attention peaked and necks craned toward the sky, the stars grew brighter and brighter.</p>

  <p>"It looks to me like stars are growing bigger," a disciple said in surprise.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the sky too, but he shook his head. "No. They aren't getting bigger. The stars are falling."</p>

  <p>As the white, dazzling stars continued to fall, they were also slowly changing their shapes, eventually ending their transformation in long silver swords.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Like raindrops, countless silver swords fell into the flag-covered areas, gathering into the flagpoles.</p>

  <p>The flagpoles functioned like storage boxes for the thin, sharp silver swords.</p>

  <p>Everyone present felt a special energy. It made their skin tingle.</p>

  <p>"What a pure truth aura!" someone exclaimed from the crowd.</p>

  <p>"It's truly amazing. This method is at least ten times stronger than the Lofty Sword..."</p>

  <p>"Is this for the members of the Oneness Sky Palace?"</p>

  <p>As the disciples felt the truth aura, excitement washed over them.</p>

  <p>"Not only that. The stars have already mixed with the soul pills, which have a great benefit to the warriors at the Other Shore Realm, too. The Oneness Sky Palace is really generous," Beldene added.</p>

  <p>"It's no wonder they stopped Zheng from inserting the flagpole. These silver swords are also clearly very dangerous. If the flagpole didn't absorb the swords, we would have all been killed by the rain of swords," said Jago, furrowing his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The corners of Zheng's mouth curled into a modest smile. From what Monica had just said, if he didn't insert the flagpole, then the swords wouldn't have fallen tonight.</p>

  <p>Of course, the warriors behind the scenes didn't want to break the rules because of someone like Zheng, and therefore asked Monica to beg him instead. He just couldn't bear Monica's pleading, or he really wanted to give it a try.</p>

  <p>The swords continued slipping into the flagpoles, spreading out to everyone beneath the flags. All the disciples closed their eyes and began to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way. Elgin and Beldene, on their behalf, left for their journey to the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Silence reigned in the surroundings. No one wasted any time when it came to cultivation. Zheng quietly activated the Truth of Godly Way and left for the Sea of Truth as well.</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng had condensed his Truth Boat, Dorothy was already there waiting for him. She caught sight of him first.</p>

  <p>"Zheng," Dorothy greeted in a kind tone.</p>

  <p>"Hi," Zheng responded nonchalantly as he continued driving his boat slowly forward and passed her.</p>

  <p>"Are you angry at me?" Dorothy asked, lowering her voice this time.</p>

  <p>"You saved my life. How could I be mad at you?" Zheng replied, in the same flat tone.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>Dorothy sped forward to catch up with Zheng and then slowed to the same pace as him. She said quietly, "In fact, Aunt Daisy isn't like this all the time.</p>

  <p>She has her own unspeakable reasons."</p>

  <p>"Just forget it. You don't have to worry about anything. I'll take care of it.</p>

  <p>I'll save her son," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Dorothy gently bit her lips. Zheng still seemed rather unhappy and she couldn't figure out why. In the moment, she didn't know what to say and thus, she just drove her Truth Boat in order to follow behind him.</p>

  <p>Beneath the endless sword baptism earlier, Zheng had felt his Soul of Light becoming stronger. Although the swords hadn't been as effective as the soul pills whose effect could only last for a short period of time, they wouldn't stop falling until the next morning.</p>

  <p>As he had made up his mind, Zheng didn't want to overthink things. He lost no time in crossing the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, Zheng was near the third line, which was a little more difficult to cross than the second one. However, with the combined help of both the soul pills and the swords, he managed to get through it and ride the waves pretty smoothly.</p>

  <p>Dorothy made no attempt to hide her strength anymore. The necklace on her chest erupted with a strong soul aura, and she quickly followed Zheng through the third line with ease.</p>

  <p>She'd let herself believe that Zheng would stop after getting through the third line, but by the looks of it, she had been wrong. In fact, Zheng seemed to be moving faster against the roaring waves than ever before.</p>

  <p>"Wait for me! Are you going to cross the fourth line?" Dorothy called loudly.</p>

  <p>"Isn't your cousin still waiting for my help?" Zheng shouted his question back at her.</p>

  <p>"There's no reason to hurry like this. Don't put yourself in danger," Dorothy said in a calmer voice.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had no intentions of stopping whatsoever. Instead, he kept driving his boat forward, despite the fact that the sea water was becoming colder and colder.</p>

  <p>It wasn't before long that Zheng reached the fourth line and he began to try crossing it. At this point, Dorothy felt like she had no choice and she gobbled three soul pills at once. Her soul aura increased greatly as she caught up with Zheng's pace once again.</p>

  <p>Crossing two lines in the Sea of Truth without stopping brought an immense pressure on Dorothy, and she could barely withstand it. She was a little tired.</p>

  <p>As soon as they crossed the fourth line though, three Truth Boats suddenly surrounded them in a pyramid shape.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! Crossing the fourth line must have been quite a task. Am I right?" someone asked jokingly from one of the strange boats.</p>

  <p>"Hand over all the soul pills you have immediately, or we'll make you suffer like you've never suffered before!" another of the strangers chimed in.</p>

  <p>"Give us the soul pills, or die here. It's that simple."</p>

  <p>Any warrior who had just successfully crossed the fourth line was bound to be very tired. These three individuals had lurked here for a very long time, just waiting for their next victim. They had undoubtedly become even more arrogant after they profitably robbed others several times.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at each of them indifferently, sensing their Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. "Do any of you have a death wish?" he asked coldly.</p>
