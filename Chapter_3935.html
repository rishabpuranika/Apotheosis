  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Grandpa Tucker," Zheng bowed to Tucker respectfully.</p>

  <p>In turn, Tucker hurried forward and helped Zheng get up. "You are the king of our Nine Li race now. You don't have to salute me," he gently scolded.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, Zheng was currently more than strong enough to command the remaining members of the Nine Li race. Moreover, his origin alone entitled him to a high status in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"This is to thank you for the Latent Theurgy you left for me back then," he said sincerely.</p>

  <p>"Latent Theurgy?" Tucker was bewildered.</p>

  <p>When Ambrose saw Tucker's surprise, he explained, "It's the Latent Theurgies we left behind in the divine land back then. The Grand Chieftain wanted to pass them on to the descendants of the Nine Li race, but it turned out Zheng had gotten them..."</p>

  <p>At that time, Zheng had relied on that Latent Theurgy to escape from Elizabeth's hot pursuit.</p>

  <p>"Our Nine Li race is destined to be blessed. After all, everything is predestined. Our other brothers can finally rest in peace..." sighed Tucker.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the members of the Nine Li race welled up in tears. They were the survivors of the Nine Li race's core members from before, and their blood was relatively pure.</p>

  <p>Ever since the destruction of their race, they had been moving on in difficulties. Now that they finally saw hope in Zheng, how could they not be happy?</p>

  <p>The moment they came to the Pear Hill, they were determined to stand together with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's appearance and his growth surprised all of them. If someone easily defeated him, then there would be no point for them to continue their existence in the world.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the remaining members of the Nine Li race who realized that, though. The super forces that crossed over to the Pear Hill's side also understood that only a very few people were qualified to enter the Other Shore at the end of the chaotic era.</p>

  <p>If the Pear Hill failed, then everything would be over.</p>

  <p>After the survivors of the Nine Li race had settled down, the Snake Goddess asked Zheng about the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>The Deleting Space closed during the battle between Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven. The Snake Goddess speculated that Ziya had closed the entrance to the Deleting Space, but it hadn't been opened yet.</p>

  <p>When she mentioned the matter to Zheng, he tried to enter it again. However, he still couldn't get in. It seemed that there was no better way but to wait.</p>

  <p>"Although we don't know what the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization will do next, you can enter the Other Shore during this peaceful period," the Snake Goddess suggested.</p>

  <p>Zheng never went to the Other Shore after he returned from the Eternal Scroll Painting. However, he didn't forget that he still had a mission.</p>

  <p>The war in the chaos had temporarily come to an end, but the trouble he had to face on the Other Shore was probably even more complicated.</p>

  <p>The vast bronze plain in the Grand Plain Stage, which was Stage Thirty-two had recorded the history of every chaotic era.</p>

  <p>Some of the races became extinct, but some were still active in the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>The civilizations that had gotten a firm foothold on the Grand Plain Stage were the ruling civilizations. Those civilizations were also quite concerned about what happened in the chaos, especially the battle in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>After all, that was the first time the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization were directly involved.</p>

  <p>There were many ways for them to hear about the news, but all the news that spread to the Grand Plain Stage came from the warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the Source World.</p>

  <p>At first, the creatures on the Grand Plain Stage believed that the winner of this war would surely be the Element Spirit Civilization. That was because rarely any race had defeated them for the past many chaotic eras. It was safe to say that the ruling civilizations on the Grand Plain Stage all lived under the shadow of the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the Element Spirit Civilization lost.</p>

  <p>The forces led by the representatives the Element Spirit Civilization had chosen and supported, such as the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race, all suffered a crushing defeat. The Chaos Ancient Gods, Lamont and Herbert, who were behind them had died. Othniel was the only one that survived in the group of Chaos Ancient Gods that sided with the Element Spirit Civilization, and one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization, Claire, was defeated as well.</p>

  <p>What shocked the many forces on the Grand Plain Stage was that even the Grandmaster of Heaven was killed.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill fought against the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization alone, but in the end, they had won the battle. Naturally, the civilizations in the Grand Plain Stage were shocked when they heard the news.</p>

  <p>There was already a group of civilizations that were willing to help Zheng in the Grand Plain Stage. When the news of the Pear Hill's victory reached them, some of the ruling civilizations that had submitted to the Element Spirit Civilization even began to stray from them.</p>

  <p>"Maybe this time is different?"</p>

  <p>"Before Zheng entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire came to him in person. They must be afraid of something!"</p>

  <p>"It was said that the Element Spirit Civilization was not in a hurry to make a move in the beginning. This time, they attacked the Oneness Sky Palace purely because of Zheng..."</p>

  <p>Even though these Eternal Realm masters had surrendered to the Element Spirit Civilization, they didn't necessarily agree with what the civilization had done. The legend of the battle on the Pear Hill and the story about Zheng ignited the flames of bravery in their hearts? but even if they had their thoughts, they kept it a secret at that stage.</p>

  <p>The bronze plain on the Grand Plain Stage seemed endless that it took a lot of time to walk from one side to the other. The entrance to Stage Thirty- three was at the end of the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>"The dots on the ground are...snow..." Zheng looked down at the bronze plain, where there were countless snowflakes on the ground.</p>

  <p>The images on the ground were real, but all the images in the plain refreshed once an hour. Only the snowflakes remained fixed on the ground.</p>

  <p>What was interesting was that when he stepped on the ground, he felt the cold air that came from the bronze plain.</p>

  <p>"The end of the far north is a land of wild snow. Except for those masters at the Eternal Realm, very few other shore creatures come here," Libby, who was beside him, explained.</p>

  <p>Currently, in the Oneness Sky Palace, Zheng was the only one who could go to Stage Thirty-three. Of course, Libby, Pearce, and the other warriors at the Holy Soul Realm couldn't enter, so they only escorted Zheng to the entrance.</p>

  <p>"I can see that," he said as he looked at the ground engraved with dots in the distance. "Is the temperature here lower than that on the upper ice field of the Blooming Jade Stage?" he asked.</p>

  <p>In reality, the space under the bronze ground was quite expansive. Since there were so many creatures from numerous chaotic eras in the Grand Plain Stage, there were many living species within it.</p>

  <p>He had seen all sorts of Other Shore creatures along his way here. The gathering places of the Other Shore forces stretched endlessly, and some kingdoms and worlds crowded the area. However, he saw no signs of life when he arrived here. It was like all the creatures became extinct.</p>

  <p>"I think so." Pearce, who stood next to him, nodded. "Although there is no Cold Prison here, life is still forbidden in this land. Even the Eternal Realm warriors would find it hard to survive here," he explained.</p>

  <p>While he spoke, Zheng saw a great bronze circle appear in front of him. There were Sanskrit words engraved around it.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, it appeared that the Sanskrit words continually changed.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they changed from one to another in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"We're finally here at the Stage End Passage," Pearce announced as he looked at the ring.</p>

  <p>It turned out that it was not a star ring that led to Stage Thirty-three, but this massive ring.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng and his group went towards the passage, a part of the bronze ground nearby suddenly glowed.</p>

  <p>Three white balls emerged from the world of ice and snow under the bronze ground. They were members of the Element Spirit race.</p>
