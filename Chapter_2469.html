<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Right now, most of the True Gods had their names on the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>The lowest name was just above four hundred feet while the highest one, Yan's name, rested at nine hundred and twenty feet.</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods had tried a few times. One of the ones from the Floating Islands had even tried more than ten times, but his best result was just six hundred and fifty feet high.</p>

  <p>In the end, this disciple of the wealthy clan had given up and resigned himself to watching other people's good performances with a sigh.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng walked out with his flying sword, Duke immediately followed behind.</p>

  <p>Reinhard pulled a long face as he watched Duke step out.</p>

  <p>It wasn't prohibited for several True Gods to climb up at the same time in front of the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>However, it was obvious that Duke, as the leader of the alliance of wealthy clans in the debate venue, had waited for the best chance to take his turn.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was finally ready to give it a go, Duke moved close to him, putting Reinhard on high alert.</p>

  <p>"Duke, if you want to leave your name on the stone tablet, you can wait for Zheng to carve his name first. There is no need to go up together,"</p>

  <p>Reinhard said without the least bit of politeness as he stared at Duke.</p>

  <p>"Why do I have to wait for him?" Duke sneered.</p>

  <p>He had restrained himself from fighting or making any moves this whole time, but that didn't mean he was afraid of Reinhard. He had just been waiting for the opportune moment to strike.</p>

  <p>"If you have a problem waiting, you can go first." Reinhard stretched out his hand, gesturing for Duke to go ahead, and then he winked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng knew what Reinhard meant.</p>

  <p>Duke had purposefully been waiting for this moment to make a move.</p>

  <p>Obviously, he was plotting something.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's words naturally displeased Duke, who laughed and said, "I have the freedom to give it a go whenever I want to. Why should I listen to you?"</p>

  <p>No matter what, he was going to follow Zheng.</p>

  <p>He opened his mouth to spit out a retort, but before he could do that, Zheng waved his hand gently and said, "It's okay, Reinhard." Then, with a glance at Duke, he said, "Since someone likes to follow me, just let him do it!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his sentence, Zheng slightly turned over his palm and pressed the flying sword down with a finger.</p>

  <p>In an instant, his body flashed and landed firmly on the flying sword!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With a thrilling noise, Zheng shot into the sky.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng set off, Duke also jumped and climbed up rapidly behind Zheng!</p>

  <p>But when he left the ground, the eyes of Tyrone, Ellis, Gino, and Wesley also flashed.</p>

  <p>The True Gods from the alliance of the rich and powerful clans all received a telepathic message which was transmitted by Duke through his life vitality. The message said, "If I fight with Zheng on the stone tablet, you should immediately attack as well!"</p>

  <p>This was indeed the best course of action.</p>

  <p>In an ideal world, Duke would be able to surpass Yan and Zheng with his own strength and the Energy-extracting Needles.</p>

  <p>He would obtain the inheritance on behalf of the Dongfang Clan. As for Yan and Zheng, their lives would not be that important.</p>

  <p>But if he couldn't surpass these two people, he would definitely fight them!</p>

  <p>By then, the disciples from the alliance of the rich and powerful clans, including the Dongfang Clan, the Tang Clan, the Leng Clan, the Fang Clan, and the Mu Clan, would fight together with him.</p>

  <p>When Reinhard noticed the True Gods exchanging glances with one another, he sneered.</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Sword Clan, make the array!"</p>

  <p>Puzzled expressions appeared on the faces of the disciples of the Sword Clan, but they still quickly followed Reinhard's order and made the sword array.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was much more decisive than Duke.</p>

  <p>Since Duke's goal was to stop the debate over the Godly Ways, fighting at this moment was their only chance.</p>

  <p>Although none of the True Gods from the wealthy clans had made a move, Reinhard wanted to be on guard and ready to fight.</p>

  <p>"Reinhard, why are you arranging the sword array?" Tyrone asked coldly. He hadn't expected Reinhard to react so quickly.</p>

  <p>Reinhard lazily looked at Tyrone. "Just for fun. Can't I do that?"</p>

  <p>As Tyrone rolled his eyes at Reinhard, he suddenly felt the whirlpool in his body quiver.</p>

  <p>He looked up and saw that Duke had crossed the invisible barrier that appeared at the height of four hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Duke had been able to break through the barrier by relying on his strength alone. Now, he had gathered the cultivation bases of seven top-rank True Gods, so he had crashed directly into the invisible barrier without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Why has Duke's aura suddenly become so strong?"</p>

  <p>"I faintly feel the consummate aura from him. But it's impossible for him to break through to become a consummate True God in the debate venue, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And yet, the aura spreading from him is already far beyond the scope of a top-rank True God!"</p>

  <p>Duke felt energy surging endlessly through his body and emerging from his chest. At this time, he had a great impulse to grab and tear Zheng into pieces directly!</p>

  <p>Compared to Duke, Zheng moved at a slower speed. By the time he passed four hundred feet, breaking the barrier was a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>He went through it smoothly and easily.</p>

  <p>"What? How did he break the invisible wall at four hundred feet?"</p>

  <p>"It seems like he didn't touch it at all!"</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that Duke smashed the wall when he crossed this height?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. That's just an invisible force wall. Even if it was smashed, it would recover soon!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was confused.</p>

  <p>After Zheng reached four hundred feet, he continued to ascend unhurriedly as he stood on the flying sword.</p>

  <p>As for Duke, he had reached a height of six hundred feet in the blink of an eye, but suddenly, his speed fell drastically.</p>

  <p>The distance between him and Zheng also shortened rapidly.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to wait for me, you know," Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Duke sneered at Zheng. "When did I wait for you?"</p>

  <p>"If you can surpass me, everyone will be safe. And if you can't, you will attack me, right?" Zheng said lightly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Duke was a little shocked. It was exactly what he had been thinking.</p>

  <p>But even if Zheng had guessed his plan, so what? Unless Zheng chose to give up now, the outcome would not change!</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Duke snorted coldly, and the momentum inside his body suddenly burst out, causing his speed to increase threefold.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he left Zheng far behind him. Soon, he crossed seven hundred feet and went straight for eight hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Zheng still looked calm and unhurried. He was slowly climbing on the flying sword with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Sword Divine City, a trace of tension appeared on Harold's face.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that Duke would have a set of Energy-extracting Needles!" Gibson said flatly.</p>

  <p>Taking a deep sigh, Marsh said, "There are not many Energy-extracting Needles left in the Dongfang Clan. What if Duke surpasses Yan?"</p>

  <p>After Solomon had set the Eye of Perception, strong warriors could see details that weren't obvious to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they had all watched with a long face as Duke quietly distributed the gold and silver needles.</p>

  <p>"Even with a set of Energy-extracting Needles, Duke can only double his strength, at the most. I don't think he can reverse the situation by taking advantage of the needles," said Harold with a frown.</p>

  <p>However, Harold's tone was uncertain.</p>
