  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only the Golden Beast Statue that was thrown outside had the ability to lure away these Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng distracted the Time Ghosts using the Golden Beast Statue a while later, everyone had to follow him. He was the one who had the right to decide whether to go deeper into the Time Sea Forbidden Land or to leave that place entirely.</p>

  <p>"I will continue to go deeper into the forbidden land," Luo Zheng said without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Reginald, Jolyon and others gave a nod of approval. About half of the True Gods didn't want to explore the forbidden land while the other half wanted to continue the exploration with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"And who do you think you are? What makes you think that you can make decisions for us?" a top-rank True God sneered.</p>

  <p>"He is just a low-rank True God," Langston muttered as he made his way towards the rest.</p>

  <p>"We want to go back! Chart out a way for us so that we can return," a mid-rank True God stated boldly.</p>

  <p>The Golden Beast Statue had no importance in the eyes of these True Gods. They thought that since they wanted to return, Luo Zheng was obliged to help them navigate their way back.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings outside the Time Sea wore different expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>According to the female leader of the Sun Blind race, there was a supreme treasure of belief in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. So these Holy Beings hoped that these True Gods would explore the forbidden land.</p>

  <p>Some consummate True Gods had already entered the place, but since the True Gods present were in a larger number, the Holy Beings pinned their hopes on the True Gods as well.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng casually looked at the angry True Gods and softly said, "It seems as if we are no longer on the same page. Therefore, people who are willing to go further can step forward."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Jolyon, Reginald, Pascal and many other True Gods stood behind him.</p>

  <p>And the rest including Langston stayed where they were.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with Tianxing as well." Without hesitation, Aleyna joined Luo Zheng's team as well.</p>

  <p>"I'm following Tianxing." Kelsey walked up to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I want to further explore the forbidden land," Liusu said after pondering for a while.</p>

  <p>"Liusu, if you go further, you'll most likely die. Don't follow him,"</p>

  <p>Langston pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I'm not following him. I'm just making a decision of my own," Liusu said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Langston didn't know how to convince Liusu to stay. He gave Luo Zheng a hard look and said, "Listen, if you want to die, then go ahead, but don't lead others to their death as well. Lead us back to the forbidden land's entrance, and I'll reward you with some divine might coins if I'm in a good mood. Or else you'll regret that you didn't listen to me."</p>

  <p>"That's right. You'll face our wrath if you disobey us," another mid-rank True God said coldly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand and gestured them to leave. "Since you don't want to go with me, feel free to leave."</p>

  <p>At the gate of the Divine Time Temple, the Time Ghosts stood still but carefully guarded the door.</p>

  <p>"You!" Langston said, visibly aggravated.</p>

  <p>"Why are you wasting your breath with him? Let me catch him, and then he'll be at our disposal." A mid-rank True God suddenly leaped out from behind Langston, stretching out his hands to grab for Luo Zheng. It looked as if he wished to abduct Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was a cracking sound.</p>

  <p>Lightning snakes the size of a thumb emerged from the mid-rank True God's hands and started wandering around.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God had reached a high level in the cultivation of the Thunderstorm Godly Way. He underestimated Luo Zheng, considering that he was just a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>When Reginald and the rest of the group watched the events unfold, they were left in utter shock. They didn't want Luo Zheng to be abducted by Langston and the mean mid-rank True God, but there was nothing they could do now.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God's hands suddenly turned into sharp claws and went for Luo Zheng's face. Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with a sharp luster. He gave a cold snort and firmly grasped the mid-rank True God's right hand.</p>

  <p>A powerful force erupted when Luo Zheng's hand made contact with the opponent's hand, and the lightning snakes on the arms of the mid-rank True God went towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, lightning snakes emerged from Luo Zheng's hands as well. They also originated from the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The lightning snakes released by the two men crushed each other to nullify their effects.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng dragged the mid-rank True God slowly. He threw the mid-rank True God with a suplex as his right foot landed on the ground with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>Due to Luo Zheng's force, the mid-rank True God darted towards the gate of Divine Time Temple like a kite with a broken string.</p>

  <p>He smashed into the wall beside the door and fell on the ground.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were dumbfounded by the scenes they were witnessing.</p>

  <p>They were well aware that Luo Zheng intentionally smashed the mid-rank True God on the wall. Had he had tossed him outside the gate of the Divine Time Temple, that man would have been devoured by the Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>Pascal and Langston gasped with astonishment. Luo Zheng had killed Sheridan as a proving godly warrior. He even injured Langston once.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had improved his strength vastly in a short period of time, ever since he became a True God.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God was not weak and was ranked seventeenth in the Arena of Legends. But he was not strong enough to fight Tianxing. Thus, Tianxing's strength shocked the spectators.</p>

  <p>Pascal made a note to himself. He wasn't sure that he'd quite win against Tianxing if they ever fought.</p>

  <p>Nelly, who was analyzing the whole situation quietly thought that Luo Zheng was so strong that no one would be able to defeat him. More often than not, a warrior with strength like his had practiced Might Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Thus, she judged he must be the anonymous man just as her sister had assumed.</p>

  <p>With a sudden whoosh, Reginald and Jolyon stood in front of Luo Zheng, one on the right and the other on the left.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng declared, "Fight me only if you wish to die. I won't be held accountable for my actions."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't want to reveal too many of his moves as there were quite a lot of Holy Beings watching him from the outside of the Time Sea Forbidden Land. He knew enough to defend himself, without revealing much.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing has made clear his intentions of going deep into the forbidden land. You are welcome to follow him if you wish. But if anyone goes against him, they will be facing me and the War God Hall!" Reginald announced, his eyes blazing with a strong intent to fight.</p>

  <p>People from the War God Hall were born to fight. The True Gods of the War God Hall were far more powerful than other True Gods at the same level.</p>

  <p>Reginald's words proved enough to stop those True Gods who intended to return to the entrance from holding Luo Zheng as a hostage.</p>

  <p>As for Langston, his eyes were filled with fear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could sense that everyone was watching him as he made his way towards the door of the Divine Time Temple. In the distance, a pile of golden fragments with even thickness were lying there.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng thought, the golden pieces merged slowly and finally turned into the Golden Beast Statue.</p>

  <p>"Follow me. Just to be clear, it's not my fault, should anything happen to you if you are too slow to keep up," Luo Zheng said indifferently.</p>

  <p>The Golden Beast Statue was a bit far from the ghosts, so it didn't quite attract the Time Ghosts after it got resurrected from the ground. Under Luo Zheng's control, it started running wildly, forming a golden light that flew past the gate of the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts reacted at once. As soon as they noticed the Golden Beast Statue, they flew towards the statue, just like moths flew towards flames.</p>

  <p>Letting out shrill cries, the Time Ghosts turned around and went after the Golden Beast Statue.</p>

  <p>Thus, the gate to the Divine Time Temple was no more blocked.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the first person to rush out of the Divine Time Temple, and the other True Gods followed suit.</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods still weren't convinced and wanted to leave the Time Sea Forbidden land. However, the way back was filled with the Time Ghosts trying to tear the statue apart. If they went that way, they'd be courting death. Thus, they had no choice but to follow Luo Zheng into the depths of the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>
