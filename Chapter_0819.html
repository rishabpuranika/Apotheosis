<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Behind Zheng stood a level nine ogre war fighter. He wore red armor and held a giant blood-colored axe in his hand. His expression was cold and grim, as if he wanted to devour Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, those of the same race usually formed an alliance. That was the only manner in which they were able to monopolize the resources in the tower.</p>

  <p>When a talent showed up, the other races would send their elites to kill him or her while he or she was still young.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was like an accelerated world in its own right— a place for the talents to better themselves. If left to train well and without restraint, they could rise to the ranks as fast as lightning.</p>

  <p>Zheng's first show of power was shocking.</p>

  <p>The ogres were one of the top three forces in the Tower of Sin. How could they be willing to let Zheng go?</p>

  <p>Zheng had originally walked to the edge of the arena, but when the provocation from the ogre fell on his ears, he drew back the foot he had just raised.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Lucky Light in the Tower of Sin was different from that of the Dragon Soar Arena. Each race had its own secret technique. However, since the Lucky Light in the Tower of Sin could also increase one's cultivation level, Zheng naturally had to obtain as much of it as he could.</p>

  <p>In addition, the malicious aura was equally important to him.</p>

  <p>Since entering the Sea God Continent, he had killed dozens of ogres and accumulated quite a bit of the malicious aura.</p>

  <p>The ogre Borgan, whom he had just killed, had an abundance of malicious aura inside of his body. It was the perfect opportunity for Zheng to add on to his malicious aura.</p>

  <p>The "Malicious Wheel of Life and Death" was indeed an extremely powerful cultivation method, but because of the scant amount of malicious aura he possessed, he could only use the "Exterminating Wheel." If he wanted to continue cultivating, he would need more of the malicious aura.</p>

  <p>In the past, he hadn't had many chances to obtain it.</p>

  <p>If he could get his hands on both the malicious aura and the Lucky Light right here, he'd be fortunate.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around and smiled, "I accept your challenge."</p>

  <p>The level nine ogre war fighter laughed out loud. "Very good. My name is— "</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in knowing your name," Zheng said quickly, the smile on his face vanishing.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" the ogre asked, always a bit slow of mind.</p>

  <p>"Why would I care? You are to die soon."</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng said this, the forceful energy within his body erupted, his figure vanishing from where he stood.</p>

  <p>Although the ogre war fighter was slow-witted, he was not slow in movement. The moment he saw Zheng disappear, he raised his axe in a swift motion.</p>

  <p>However, he had only raised it halfway when Zheng's punch came flying straight toward the middle of the axe. The punch held ninety percent of his own power, and he didn't borrow any of the dragon scales' power. Still, it was enough to bend the giant axe.</p>

  <p>The curved axe was sent flying back toward the ogre. His muscles bulging, the ogre tried to use his impressive brute force to withstand the pressure, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>While a war general might have been able to tolerate Zheng's punch, a war fighter fell short.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Under the suppression, the bones in the ogre's body cracked. Then, with a quick movement, Zheng pressed his forefinger against the ogre's head.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Brown-colored blood spilled and scattered on the floor. After a while, it was quickly absorbed by the arena.</p>

  <p>The audience, once again, was engulfed in a state of absolute silence.</p>

  <p>Zheng had defeated Borgan with skill and speed in the first match. And now, he had killed the level nine ogre war fighter with sheer power alone.</p>

  <p>The onlookers were stunned, unable to react for a moment.</p>

  <p>How could the human's strength be a match to the ogre's?</p>

  <p>Ogres were a powerful race on the Sea God Continent. When it came to pure strength, they might not be comparable to giants, but they were far superior to the giants in many other aspects. In terms of individual strength, ogres were only inferior to the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Humans, on the other hand, had never been a race that relied on strength. So why was this human so powerful?</p>

  <p>"He's clearly just a level seven human war fighter, but he has beaten a level nine ogre war fighter with just brute strength."</p>

  <p>"We better not offend him!"</p>

  <p>"We must kill him! If he enters the lower floors of the Tower of Sin, he will win the human race another seat."</p>

  <p>Many spies lurked among the members of the various races in the audience.</p>

  <p>These creatures did not participate in the battles, but they continuously gathered intelligence and took notes if any talents from the other races made appearances. Afterward, they reported back the information so their races could come up with plans to sneakily kill those talents.</p>

  <p>No one dared to challenge Zheng again after the two brutal killings.</p>

  <p>No one dared to mock his race again either. The world had always been this way. If someone's strength exceeded expectations, people would have no choice but to show them respect. Perhaps the creatures would scheme to take out Zheng, but they certainly wouldn't dare taunt him to his face.</p>

  <p>As Zheng walked off the arena, Phoebe smiled at him. "I will take you to get your points registered. The Lucky Light is not the only award here."</p>

  <p>The arena was indeed the core of the Tower of Sin. A perfect set of facilities had been built to support it.</p>

  <p>Following Phoebe's lead, Zheng quickly found out where to get his points registered.</p>

  <p>After winning two matches, he was rewarded with a supreme life vitality crystal and twenty points.</p>

  <p>"What can I do with the points?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Phoebe smiled and said, "Whatever you want!"</p>

  <p>Facilities at the Tower of Sin were arranged well. Points could be used to rent cultivation rooms, or they could be used to buy various other things.</p>

  <p>One could even obtain different types of information and exchange the points for cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>As Zheng finished registering the points, two men and a woman walked over to him. They were human war generals.</p>

  <p>When the three human war generals saw that Zheng was with a woman from the Demon Night, their expressions turned strange.</p>

  <p>The human race too had spies stationed on the first floor. The three war generals had hurriedly rushed here from other floors upon receiving the news.</p>

  <p>The leader glanced at Zheng casually, saying with an arrogant smile, "Zheng Luo? I heard you just killed two ogre war fighters on the first floor? Not bad! Come with us."</p>

  <p>Zheng was not too surprised that they knew his name, but he did not like the tone of the stranger's voice. He stared indifferently at the person, then turned to Phoebe and said, "Weren't you taking me somewhere?"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng had completely ignored him, the stranger flared up and his eyes flashed with a hint of anger. "My name is Dylon," he said coldly. "And I'm from the Purple Heart Sacred Place. Since you chose to enter the Tower of Sin to cultivate, you should know that we humans must form an alliance.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, other than death, you would have no other choice left."</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled his eyes at this. "We humans must form an alliance? I understand that it's important for us, but what qualifications do you have to order me around?"</p>

  <p>"You! You couldn't live longer than three days in here without the protection of the Purple Heart Sacred Place!" Dylon said in anger.</p>

  <p>According to him, the fact that he had personally come here from another floor to visit Zheng was a great honor. But Zheng didn't look like he appreciated the kindness at all. He even had the gall to be arrogant about it!</p>

  <p>"How many days I can live should not concern you," Zheng said. Without another look, he stepped forward, while Phoebe merely smiled apologetically and followed behind.</p>

  <p>After Zheng left, Dylon's face was still red with rage. "That brat!"</p>

  <p>Dylon's another companion did not agree with the sentiment. "Why are you threatening him? He is indeed very powerful. If he can better himself quickly in the Tower of Sin, he might be able to secure a seat for the human race."</p>

  <p>"Are you counting on him? A human war fighter?" Dylon sneered.</p>

  <p>"Could you defeat an ogre war fighter when you were once a war fighter yourself? At that time, you wouldn't even have dared to enter the Tower of Sin!" Olivia Xia, a female warrior, shot at him coldly.</p>

  <p>"Olivia..." Dylon started, only to be cut off.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" Olivia Xia shook her head. "Let's just look on for a while. That female member of the Demon Night seems to be giving him advice. I don't think he would be foolish enough to challenge the warriors he knows he can't defeat. After a while, I'll go and talk to him."</p>

  <p>The humans had already taken note of Zheng. The other races couldn't fall behind either.</p>

  <p>On the first floor of the Tower of Sin, many races were keeping an eye on Zheng. The news of him winning the two matches was also being spread through various channels.</p>

  <p>Aside from the human race, every other race had the same goal, and that was to kill Zheng.</p>
