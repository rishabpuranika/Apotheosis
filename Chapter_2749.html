<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A deafening roar came from the Desperation Plain and echoed throughout the surroundings.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had been flying at a constant speed, froze in midair when he heard this powerful sound. His face darkened immediately.</p>

  <p>Leland and the other three top-rank True Gods also looked grim.</p>

  <p>"Why did you stop? The Desperation Plain is right ahead of us!" the strange fish said, continuing to rush forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out and slapped the air in front of him. At once, a big lone hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed the fish, dragging it back.</p>

  <p>"Why did you grab me? The exit is right ahead of us..." the strange fish complained as it struggled in the big hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't bother to explain. With a slight movement of his finger, the big hand turned into a large net, trapping the strange fish within it. Then, he slowly floated toward a high mountain in front of him, followed by Leland and the others.</p>

  <p>After reaching the top of the mountain, Luo Zheng and the others carefully craned their heads to look at the scene below.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! So many fiends!"</p>

  <p>"Are they waiting for us?"</p>

  <p>"We're doomed..." the top-rank True Gods cried in fear.</p>

  <p>"Do you think we're such a big threat that so many fiends would have gathered here to deal with us?" Leland sneered at them in response.</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of fiends waiting in the Desperation Plain. Aside from them, there was also a large number of ferocious beasts with relatively strong auras.</p>

  <p>In particular, there was a huge fiend standing at the end of the Desperation Plain which had such a strong aura that it struck fear into Leland's heart.</p>

  <p>Even Holy Beings would be fearful of such a powerful fiend. Leland knew that there was no way that all these fiends had come here just to deal with them.</p>

  <p>"But who on earth is here that all these fiends are on high alert and ready for combat?" Leland muttered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced down at the Desperation Plain, and then stared at the other side, where there was a huge space door.</p>

  <p>"The space door will lead to the fifth stage?" Luo Zheng asked the strange fish.</p>

  <p>The strange fish was now tied up by Luo Zheng. It couldn't run around like it usually did, so it settled for nodding passively. "Yes! That's the door!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng used the Reincarnation Soul Weapon once more to probe Tianming's memories.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, a cautious look appeared on his face. "They... have entered this space channel."</p>

  <p>"Who do you mean? Do you know who those fiends are waiting for?"</p>

  <p>Leland asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded solemnly. "Nicholas... The alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands."</p>

  <p>"What?!" Leland's eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>Of course he knew which powerful clans were part of the alliance. He had only been able to get into the forbidden areas before by building a good relationship with these powerful clans.</p>

  <p>"They were in the fifth stage! Does Nicholas want to control the Abyss Demon Region?" Leland continued, excitement replacing the surprise in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"Then we can be safe." Leland finally felt a little relieved.</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods also smiled when they heard this. Although it was impossible for them to make the acquaintance of the Holy Beings, the Holy Beings would at least, as fellow humans, help them and treat them as their peers, which was more than they could ever expect from the fiends even if the fiends chose to spare their lives.</p>

  <p>"Sort of," Luo Zheng said hesitantly. "I can take the chance to leave when the situation is chaotic."</p>

  <p>"Take the chance to leave?" Leland echoed in confusion. It sounded as if Luo Zheng wanted to avoid the Holy Beings for some reason.</p>

  <p>"I have some conflict with them, so it won't be appropriate for me to meet them here," Luo Zheng said lightly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had planned to leave this place before the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands arrived. But now, it seemed that it was too late.</p>

  <p>"You have some conflict with the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands?" There was a strange expression in Leland's eyes.</p>

  <p>There was no one in the divine land who would dare to provoke the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands, not even members of the Moon Clan or the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had just said in an indifferent voice that he had some conflict with them. Whatever it was, it could not be as simple a matter as he made it out to be.</p>

  <p>Anyway, no matter how curious Leland was about the situation, he did not belong to any of the powerful clans, so naturally, he didn't want to get involved in such matters. At the moment, his only priority was to escape from this place.</p>

  <p>However, right at this moment, Gallio, who was on the Desperation Plain, suddenly turned his head to look over.</p>

  <p>"Crap!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Leland, and the top-rank True Gods crouched down. Leland even released a stream of internal momentum and performed a special token to conceal all their auras.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, sir?" a fiend commander asked.</p>

  <p>"Why are humans there?" Gallio asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>The fiend commander shifted his gaze to the mountain range on his right side, and then sneered.</p>

  <p>"There has been a report about it. They are probably the small rats that came out from the Reincarnation Land."</p>

  <p>"Crush those rats. I don't want to leave any room for accidents," Gallio said indifferently. "Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>Since Begaus hadn't killed them, the fiend commander had no choice but to get rid of them himself.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, a giant bird landed in front of him. He leaped up onto the bird and flew toward the mountain on the right.</p>

  <p>In order to hide, Luo Zheng and the others had restrained their spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng heard the sound of the giant bird's wings flapping above them, he knew that they had been too late. He raised his head with a helpless smile on his face. "There's no need to hide. We've already been discovered."</p>

  <p>Standing on the giant bird, the fiend commander looked down at Luo Zheng and the others. Then, in a thunderous voice, he roared, "No matter where you came from, there'll be a chance of survival for you if you surrender!"</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>As the commander spoke, he raised a halberd that was crackling with waves of faint red energy.</p>

  <p>Feeling the power of that energy, Leland twitched his eyes in nervousness.</p>

  <p>This fiend was much more powerful than Begaus, the one they had previously encountered.</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods also trembled in fear. They were not at all capable of going against a being this powerful.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, remained calm. From the corner of his eyes, he glanced at the space door at the end of the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>His best bet of getting out of this situation was to sneak away during the chaos when the two parties fought.</p>

  <p>From Tianming's memories, Luo Zheng knew that the group of people led by Nicholas was very close to the exit of the space channel.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng and his group stay silent, the fiend commander let out a sinister laugh. "You want to waste my time? Then let me finish all of you off..."</p>

  <p>However, before he could finish his sentence, there was a flash of dazzling light at the space door. dozens of powerful auras suddenly burst out through the door. Nicholas had led all the members of the alliance to the sixth stage. The fiend commander naturally shifted his attention to them.</p>

  <p>'Now, this is the right time!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed, and the Shadow Bearing Sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>His body turned into a beam of light and shot toward the fiend commander.</p>

  <p>The fiend commander was quick to react. Seeing that Luo Zheng still dared to make a move in this situation, he sneered and brought the halberd down on Luo Zheng's head.</p>
