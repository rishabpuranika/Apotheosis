<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Heavenly essence filled the nine ditches, shining a beautiful silver in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>The heavenly body was originally a means of creating a puppet.</p>

  <p>A puppet made from heavenly essence was nearly immortal— even if its body was ripped apart, it could repair itself in an instant.</p>

  <p>But refining the heavenly essence was no easy feat.</p>

  <p>Obtaining a small amount of heavenly essence with poor purity already required much energy.</p>

  <p>Although some puppeteers managed to make a puppet with the heavenly body, it was normally of a very small size. For this to work, a soul was needed to be sealed within the puppet— because of this need, it was usually regarded as an evil kind of martial arts.</p>

  <p>It was by using the black flame that Luo Zheng had managed to refine the heavenly essence from abundant weapons in such a short time without any waste or impurity.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Master Feng clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>In an instant, many snake-shaped textures flashed at the edges of the ditches. These divine textures had been drawn after the ditches were dug out.</p>

  <p>Strands of red lines appeared from each divine texture and crept into the ditches like a hoard of worms.</p>

  <p>Buzz…</p>

  <p>Making a series of dull sounds, the strands of lines twisted around the coagulated heavenly essence. From Zheng's view in the air, it looked as though nine red Genuine Dragons were crouching low on the ground.</p>

  <p>"All rise!"</p>

  <p>Waving his hands and clenching his fists toward the ditches, Master Feng shouted. Immediately, the red lines tied the heavenly bodies tightly together and lifted them up from the ditches, making them float in the air.</p>

  <p>Each dragon looked as vivid as a living creature.</p>

  <p>Their tails resembled clouds of fire, layers of scales covered their bodies, and their robust heads raised graphically toward the sky.</p>

  <p>It was clear that the Celestial Position race had put a lot of effort into the nine heavenly bodies, having carved out each of the dragons' details.</p>

  <p>For instance, the largest one had five claws, so naturally, it belonged to the Five-clawed Golden Dragon. Besides that one, all the other dragon bodies had four claws. Such was one of the many differences between the nine Genuine Dragons, all of which the Celestial Position race had detailed in carving the heavenly bodies, down to every characteristic.</p>

  <p>Some of them had two tendrils while others had eight, some dragons had only two horns while others had four.</p>

  <p>Extending his hands into the air, Master Feng yelled at all of the dragons' souls, "Now is the time!"</p>

  <p>It had been an age that the dragons spent dreaming of regaining their physical bodies.</p>

  <p>The new bodies built by heavenly essence weren't weaker than their original bodies. In some aspects, they were even more powerful. But one fatal weakness remained— they couldn't be used for cultivation, so the dragons couldn't improve their cultivation levels in these bodies.</p>

  <p>If they had to live with such bodies in their remaining lives, the only aspect they could improve on in the future was their souls.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, they had no choice but to remain in the powerful heavenly bodies— they were undoubtedly their best options.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The souls of the nine Genuine Dragons spiraled in the air and entered their new bodies one after another.</p>

  <p>The heavenly bodies were all carved out perfectly, so much that they looked almost identical to the nine living dragons. Only their eyes differed.</p>

  <p>Before the bodies were occupied by the souls, the eyes on them were vacant without the might of the Genuine Dragons.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon was the first to occupy his new body.</p>

  <p>After a fierce tremble, the heavenly body began rolling in the air.</p>

  <p>Soon, a peculiar light flashed in the dragon's eyes. From this light, the powerful Mu Ning of the Five-clawed Golden Dragon was sensed.</p>

  <p>Such was the Mu Ning of a real dragon!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon twisted his new body and began ascending into the sky.</p>

  <p>But instead of flying up, he crawled toward it.</p>

  <p>As his robust claws landed in the air, they gathered up power from the Space Law and created an invisible wall for him to climb up. As he crawled up into the sky, his claws would flash with a silver light when they landed steadily into air.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before he surpassed the Supreme Lords that were floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Then, he raised his enormous head and roared deafeningly at the sky.</p>

  <p>The deafening roar reverberated through the entire Breaking Cloud World. Even those inside the supreme world channel at the edge of the supreme world could hear his roar loud and clear.</p>

  <p>After the Five-clawed Golden Dragon merged successfully with his heavenly body, the heavenly bodies of the other Genuine Dragons followed suit and came to life.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon, the red dragon, the green dragon…</p>

  <p>After being occupied by the Genuine Dragons' souls, the colors of the bodies changed accordingly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Following the Five-clawed Golden Dragon, they ascended into the sky, raising their heads.</p>

  <p>Their loud and penetrating roars resounded throughout the sky.</p>

  <p>Each of the Genuine Dragons had the strength to face a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>While they were stronger than ordinary Supreme Lords in terms of physical strength and theurgy, they couldn't carry the Heavenly Destinies. In this universe, only the highest levels of the Laws of Causality were considered powerful martial arts.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the Genuine Dragon race had some special theurgies to them, equal to the Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>Since the Genuine Dragons had obtained their heavenly bodies successfully, they were to be of great help to the human race.</p>

  <p>After the Five-clawed Golden Dragon stopped his howls, he twisted his huge body and turned to face Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Compared to the great head of the Five-clawed Golden Dragon, Luo Zheng was a mere fly. The dragon's eyes were a dozen feet in size, much larger than Zheng's entire body.</p>

  <p>With a soft smile, Luo Zheng looked into the dragon's eyes sincerely.</p>

  <p>The souls of the nine Genuine Dragons had been hiding deep within his brain for a long time, ever since the very beginning of his long journey.</p>

  <p>There had been some disagreements between him and the Five-clawed Golden Dragon, but now Luo Zheng felt reluctant to part with their souls.</p>

  <p>Although they mostly remained silent, they had always given Luo Zheng the help and guidance he needed at his most critical moments.</p>

  <p>"We, Genuine Dragons, were originally Holy Mike's contractual legendary beasts. Since he is now on the brink of death, we must do what we can to help him. You are Holy Mike's son and now, we regard you as our new master."</p>

  <p>After a legendary beast formed a soul contract with a warrior, they became the latter's contractual beast. A portion of both parties' souls became closely intertwined with each other.</p>

  <p>Such a contract existed between Mike and the Genuine Dragons. He had their absolute obedience, allowing no betrayal or resistance.</p>

  <p>Even though they were willing to accept Luo Zheng as their master, they couldn't become his official contractual beasts.</p>

  <p>With a nod, he gave the Five-clawed Golden Dragon a smile and said, "I believe we can overcome this crisis! Believe in my luck and that of my father as well."</p>

  <p>Although the havoc raised by the Sacred race could have been the end of the Supreme Lords in the universe, it was a new starting point for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was well aware that all these things had originated from the divine land— in order to change the fate of the universe, he would have to someday enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>After gaining their new bodies, the dragons had to hide themselves in the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place— one other disadvantage of the heavenly bodies was their inability to transform themselves into humans. It was all they could do to hide their huge bodies in the mountains.</p>

  <p>After helping the dragons obtain their new bodies, Luo Zheng began planning the war against the Demon Night race. Still, there was something he had to figure out.</p>

  <p>In his mansion at the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place, Luo Zheng found a rock to sit quietly on.</p>

  <p>Shutting his eyes, he scanned certain memories in his mind.</p>

  <p>In the past, these memories recorded only the information of a great world.</p>

  <p>Four years ago, these memories had expanded a million times for the sake of the sorcerer race. This was because Luo Zheng had fused with the wills of a million great worlds.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, these wills had extended through the ascending passageways and spread across the supreme worlds. Steadily and quickly, they had covered many parts of the universe, but Luo Zheng still had yet to scan through their memories after returning from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Now, he was taken aback by what he found out through these memories.</p>

  <p>The wills of the one million great worlds had covered over six thousand supreme worlds in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>This included all the supreme worlds belonging to the ogres and the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, Luo Zheng could obtain all information about the Demon Night race in the past years, including pieces from Xun's birth up until her coronation as the queen.</p>

  <p>The entire Demon Night race no longer held any secrets from Luo Zheng— he needed to pick out important details that were favorable for his next plans.</p>
