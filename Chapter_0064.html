<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood among the disciples who had passed the test. One by one, more disciples emerged from the Bloody Mountain. They took turns throwing crystal fragments into the baskets.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Luo Luo Zheng spotted Nory jumping out of a flying chariot. He gave Luo Luo Zheng a cheerful wave before he hurried to the baskets. Luo Luo Zheng watched as Nory took out a handful of crystal fragments and placed them into the baskets.</p>

  <p>Nory had passed the test too!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was quite surprised. Nory was only at the bone refining level. How was it possible for him to collect ten purple fragments in the test? During the test, Luo Luo Zheng had planned to give Nory spare fragments once he had reached the third level. However, Luo Luo Zheng encountered the ogre and then, he didn't get the chance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know how, but it seemed as though Nory had passed the Blooded Test all by himself. It was impossible for a man at the bone refining level to kill the unreal beasts in the third level. How did Nory manage it?</p>

  <p>Could Nory have been downplaying his abilities? The thought flashed through Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Smiling, Nory walked over to Luo Luo Zheng, obviously pleased with himself. "Ha!</p>

  <p>I have passed the test, Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"How did you do that? How did you get enough fragments?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a long story. The short version is that I got lucky." Then he told Luo Luo Zheng what happened after he entered the third level. Nory happened to see two disciples from noble clans fighting each other for a fragment.</p>

  <p>At last, both disciples were critically wounded and forced out of the test.</p>

  <p>Nory took advantage and collected their fragments. That was how he passed the test.</p>

  <p>As he listened, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but marvel at Nory's good luck.</p>

  <p>Flying chariots flew back and forth till the last of the disciples had collected in the square.</p>

  <p>The Blooded Test was finally over.</p>

  <p>While those who passed the test were in high spirits, those who failed looked utterly crestfallen.</p>

  <p>The eliminated disciples from noble clans were quickly taken away by their families. They could hardly contain their resentment. Chad Zhuge shot a look of pure venom at Luo Luo Zheng before he left. He had always prided himself on his ability before taking the test. Although this was his first shot at the blooded test, Chad had been confident that he would pass it.</p>

  <p>After all, it was a rare thing for a disciple from the top seven noble clans to fail the Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>Chad had never expected that Luo Luo Zheng would defeat him. It certainly didn't sit well with him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Nory were talking and laughing at the far side. Of course, Luo Luo Zheng noticed the venomous look from Chad, yet it didn't concern him.</p>

  <p>Being a body refiner was not easy. It was a long and difficult road, full of peril. Luo Luo Zheng felt ready for the upcoming challenges. He would overcome all obstacles in his way. Now that he had decided to go down this road, Luo Luo Zheng knew he must not fear making some enemies.</p>

  <p>At this point, Perrin and Billy looked the most frustrated and exasperated of all.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Billy had sent two of his clansmen who had registered for the blooded test to kill Luo Luo Zheng in the Bloody Mountain. But it turned out that he had underestimated Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dim and Tim also failed the test. They allied with Chad to rob from others. And then they came across Luo Luo Zheng. But before they had the time to use their Final Killer, they were knocked out of the test by other participants.</p>

  <p>It was downright humiliating.</p>

  <p>Even Billy, who always acted casual, was unable to contain his emotions.</p>

  <p>When he learned of what had happened, he launched a furious tirade at them before allowing his clansmen to be taken away. He would have to spend more time thinking about how to deal with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As for Perrin, he could only trail behind Billy with a sullen face. Perrin would just embarrass himself if he went to mock Luo Luo Zheng. He had never thought that Luo Luo Zheng, who had been as insignificant as a tiny ant, would grow into an intimidating opponent.</p>

  <p>That night, all participants who had passed the test officially joined Cloud Sect as outer disciples.</p>

  <p>Since it was late, the mentors from all thirty-three peaks would have to choose their disciples the next day.</p>

  <p>And so, these new disciples had to spend the night at the foot of the Bloody Mountain.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the dormitory was more relaxed. After a tough haul, the disciples had finally met their first goal.</p>

  <p>Some of them were so excited that they could hardly fall asleep. They spent most of the evening talking all about the choices of peaks.</p>

  <p>Master Xu from the Skytop Peak was the most discussed person among these newcomers.</p>

  <p>There were many tales about Skytop Peak. Topping all other 32 peaks, it was said to cream off most talents in the sect.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Nory sat at the corner of the room, listening to this discussion.</p>

  <p>Nory listened intently. His eyes glittered with anticipation. Luo Luo Zheng saw his expression and asked, "So which peak do you prefer? Skytop Peak?"</p>

  <p>Nory scratched his head and laughed, "I wish. But I'm afraid I won't qualify for it."</p>

  <p>Nory was acutely aware of what he was capable of. Skytop Peak would choose the disciples who had performed well in the test. He assumed that the big man with a great sword would probably get into Skytop Peak.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, I have decided to stick with you. I find that I am lucky as long as I stay with you," Nory said.</p>
