  <p>
</p>

  <p>He might have been powerful, but Luo Zheng had already consumed most of his strength and energy to cut off the tail of the mobula using his consummate sword intent. He was still confused as to the composition of the mobula's broken tail.</p>

  <p>After picking it up and briefly inspecting the broken tail, Luo Zheng tucked it inside his space ring. Beast tails like this were quite rare. In the future, he could probably use it for refining weapons. If not, he could make money out of it by selling the rare object at a high price.</p>

  <p>"My friend, thank you very much for saving my life," said the warrior, whose hands were cupped to express his heartfelt gratitude to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Naturally, it was clear to this warrior that the tail of the mobula was of great value. But since Luo Zheng was his savior, he thought it was inadvisable to battle it out with him for this rare and valuable object.</p>

  <p>This warrior was among those from the other grade-two sects, who were at levels much higher than Zheng's. Luo Zheng was only at the third grade of the nature level. Thus, it would be understandable if these warriors looked down on Luo Zheng. Warriors at these levels would have taken for granted that the young fighter lagged far behind them. But since Luo Zheng was his savior, the warrior completely changed his mind and even began to admire him.</p>

  <p>He had attempted to kill the evil fire mobula by using his skilled blade intent and harnessing all his strength.</p>

  <p>But his blade didn't even hurt the mobula's tail at all. On the other hand, Luo Zheng easily sliced off the tail with his sword. The warrior guessed that Luo Zheng even hadn't used all his strength when he did this.</p>

  <p>As he analyzed what had just happened, the warrior decided that he couldn't rashly annoy this guy with such mighty strength.</p>

  <p>"That's alright. Since we're taking the same path, it's natural and unavoidable to need each other's help!"</p>

  <p>Even before he could finish speaking, several more mobulas jumped up, one after another, to attack the warriors on the stone pillars.</p>

  <p>In the face of these beasts' assaults, the warriors masterfully displayed their unique and incomparable skills.</p>

  <p>How would it be possible for them to pass the Cloud Road easily? If they were unlucky, they would risk their lives on their way to complete the trial. At this critical time, every warrior was giving his best to fight off the beasts. Rushing forward, they tried every means to slay the mobulas, whose numbers never seemed to dwindle.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhh!" one warrior screamed.</p>

  <p>A mobula had dragged him into the lava pit. His life vitality protected him from being hurt, while he was only stuck in the lava for a short while. Then, another five or six mobulas emerged and pulled the warrior deeper into the lava.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, several warriors' faces turned ghastly pale. That was the first warrior killed on Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>All other warriors present there were top disciples from different sects.</p>

  <p>They were all exceptional fighters honed by a variety of life and death situations. What was clear to every warrior was that if they wanted to get out of their present situation, emotions like fear or anxiety had no place there. Their only option to get out of this dangerous situation was to fight desperately.</p>

  <p>They stood a better chance of moving ahead if they continued to fight, but death would be inevitable if they so much as flinched.</p>

  <p>Most of them knew this to be true, but it was still hard for them to act accordingly. In this situation, elite disciples were perceived to have been mentally stronger than ordinary disciples.</p>

  <p>"Fight! Run faster!" they heard the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Be careful. Don't just concentrate on attacking the devil fishes. For us, what's more important is to dodge their assaults as fast as we can!"</p>

  <p>Silver flowers flashed on Zheng's long Streamer Sword. He had no intention of killing all those mobulas at all because these devil fishes attacked him in large quantities. Thus, it was utterly impossible for him to kill every single one of them. And because the devil fishes were not small, more time would be needed if Luo Zheng wanted to harm any of the fishes seriously.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng weighed the pros and cons, he was busy dodging and would counterattack when a devil fish got close to him.</p>

  <p>By fighting and dodging this way while running, the warriors at least managed to dash seven or eight miles. It was only then that they gradually escaped the clutches of the devil fishes.</p>

  <p>Except for Luo Zheng, most of the warriors had run out of breath. What was worse, the two female disciples from Iridescence Sect were sweating all over, and appeared to be extremely exhausted.</p>

  <p>But staring at the boundless Sea of Raging Fire and dense stone pillars, no one could rest at ease. For the time being, they could do nothing but grit their teeth and run ahead non-stop. If they slowed down their pace moving forward, tides of lava would rise. Then, they would be on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>One of the warriors patted his pocket. Instantly, ten medicinal pills appeared in his hand. As he swung his hand randomly, the pills flew in different directions towards the other warriors, so every person present got one pill. Soon afterward, he ordered, "Eat it! These pills are helpful for you to restore your physical strength and life vitality to certain extent."</p>

  <p>To cultivate and produce life vitality within their bodies, warriors needed to meditate. Pills that were effective for replenishing life vitality were of great value wherever they were. Today, this warrior contributed ten medicinal pills all at once. This contribution was considerable.</p>

  <p>Contributing the pills was a wise move. Defeating the flock of devil fishes by himself was impossible. He needed the collective effort of every warrior to defeat the creatures. He thought that replenishing the warriors' life vitality and enhancing their physical strength would double their efforts to escape before they finally left the damned place.</p>

  <p>And he was right. The warriors no longer encountered any other ferocious living creatures. Unfortunately, another disaster awaited them.</p>
