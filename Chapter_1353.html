<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1353 Fight For The Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone's breath hitched at the amount this short warrior was proposing. A life vitality jade's value was ten thousand times higher than a mere life vitality crystal.</p>

  <p>With this conversion rate, that would mean that three hundred thousand life vitality jades would be equal to three billion supreme life vitality crystals! Just thinking of such stupendous amount was enough to have someone's palm itching.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword was indeed a first-rank divine weapon, but offering three hundred thousand life vitality jades for it was still too shocking.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the warriors knew the bidder could afford it.</p>

  <p>"Caleb's family controls 80% of the mines in dozens of supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>The price of three hundred thousand life vitality jades is something he could definitely afford!"</p>

  <p>"But if I were the one who had the sword, I wouldn't sell it even for a price that good. Life vitality jades can be earned through time but acquiring a first-rank divine weapon is just once-in-a-lifetime! Besides, having such a great weapon can increase your chances of survival in a tough fight!"</p>

  <p>Caleb Jia did not pay attention to this idle talk and merely stared at Zheng expectantly. "What do you think? The price I'm offering is fair, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>However, Zheng shook his head. "I'm sorry. It's got nothing to do with the price. This sword is simply not for sale."</p>

  <p>Caleb Jia was powerless against Zheng's refusal. There was no way he could resort to force since his abilities were far inferior to those of Jared who had already been beaten up by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to close the door again, not really willing to waste even more time bothering with these Ice Cloud House warriors.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to pull the door shut, a life vitality jade was suddenly thrown into the gap and rolled towards him.</p>

  <p>A voice rang out from the crowd, "Jim of the Swallow Cloud House wants to exchange a single life vitality jade for the sword. If you give the sword to him, he will ensure your safety in the Mist Palace. If you refuse, your life may become forfeit in your stay here."</p>

  <p>"This..."</p>

  <p>Such an obvious display of arrogance had Zheng raging in his mind.</p>

  <p>There was clearly something wrong with these warriors. He was the one who took this sword from the Weapon House. It rightfully belonged to him. These warriors were greedy and were not willing to work hard enough to go to the Weapon House and take it for themselves. Now that he had it, all of them were scrambling to take it away from him.</p>

  <p>His goal in sending Jared flying with a single punch was to intimidate these warriors so they would leave him alone. He didn't expect that they would be far more insistent when it came to the sword.</p>

  <p>And now the warriors from the Swallow Cloud House also wanted to take it.</p>

  <p>He was aware of the gap in power between the two Houses. The Ice Cloud House couldn't be compared with Swallow Cloud House in terms of disciples, but Zheng did not care. He wasn't afraid of anyone in this place.</p>

  <p>He glared at the life vitality jade in front of him. Some people really had the audacity to look down on others this way. Unfortunately, Zheng wasn't someone they could easily bully. He walked towards the precious gem and gently ground it down with his foot.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A hint of life vitality burst forth from the life vitality jade as it was crushed underneath Zheng's foot.</p>

  <p>The life vitality contained within a single life vitality jade was thousands of times more concentrated than that of a supreme life vitality crystal.</p>

  <p>"No matter who you are, just go away…" he said, beginning to close the door.</p>

  <p>The warrior opened his mouth but Zheng quickly slammed the palace door shut, not wanting to hear whatever he still had to say.</p>

  <p>The warrior scoffed but did not dare push the shut door open. He instead ignited a message rune on the spot.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other warriors ruminated on whether to leave or stay.</p>

  <p>Some had initially wanted to leave but now chose to stay after hearing Jim's name.</p>

  <p>The Swallow Cloud House was superior to the Ice Cloud House when it came to their disciples' strength and talent.</p>

  <p>Jim was a formidable figure here in the Swallow Cloud House and he was surely not going to back down from this fight. They expected quite a bit of drama between him and Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was grumbling with rage and annoyance at what had just happened. This Mist Palace seemed to be a chaotic place where everyone tried to snatch each other's belongings.</p>

  <p>Even the mines of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place had some set, structured rules. The gathering and living area was a place of peace where fighting and killing was prohibited. The Mist Palace didn't seem to have that. Did no one supervise or restrain these warriors' training?</p>

  <p>Was that why they were all so arrogant and willful?</p>

  <p>Zheng would have to ask Yolande once he got the chance.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>Zheng thumbed the handle of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword and a cold glint flashed across his eyes.</p>

  <p>He hadn't tested its power yet. With a smile, Zheng held it up horizontally in front of his chest.</p>

  <p>He had no idea who Jim was but if he dared to come and cause him any sort of trouble, Zheng would not hesitate to use the sword to attack him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Xun's figure suddenly flew out from his body.</p>

  <p>"Why are you coming out?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled. "I'm not doing anything. I just want to see how much your strength has increased."</p>

  <p>"They might not come here," he told her.</p>

  <p>But Xun gave him a knowing smile. "They will definitely come here," she said, staring at Zheng intently.</p>

  <p>"How sure are you?" he asked, feeling a bit weird since he wasn't used to Xun's staring.</p>

  <p>"You're an outsider, but you took the best thing in this place," she pointed out. "They would surely come for you."</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but sigh. The Mist Palace had initially been called a gathering place of over three thousand talents but he felt that this place did not deserve such a title.</p>

  <p>Its warriors were arrogant, ill-tempered, and easily jealous of other people's success.</p>

  <p>True to Xun's words, several warriors had flown over to his place in just under five minutes.</p>

  <p>When the warrior in the lead had just arrived in front of Zheng's palace, the one who had tried bargaining with Zheng earlier nodded and said, "Jim, that guy is in this palace but he said he won't see anyone!"</p>

  <p>Jim was a delicate-looking youth with fair skin and long, dark hair that made him look like a woman. His smile revealed a trace of seductive aura. "My words have already reached you. I will give you another chance: one life vitality jade for the sword and I will guarantee your safety!" he called out from beyond the door in a calm, soothing voice but the arrogance was obvious in his words. One life vitality jade in exchange for a weapon of that caliber was already pushing it but to insinuate that Zheng's life would be in danger if he didn't hand over the sword truly showed just how much he looked down on this newcomer.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not be bothered to answer. His eyes were shut and he was too busy pouring chaotic energy into the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>He hoped this weapon was as powerful as everyone claimed it to be.</p>

  <p>Once he was done, Zheng angrily screamed, "Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>A man of Jim's status couldn't help but be extremely arrogant. He was one of the super talents of Swallow Cloud House, after all, and whatever he wanted, he got without even asking.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had just rudely dismissed him. Jim's delicate features morphed into a scowl and his eyes flashed with killing intent. However, it came as soon as it went and the frown was quickly replaced with a smile. "My name is Jim. I am just a swordsman who likes to collect famous swords and treat them as friends! Your cultivation does not match up well with this sword. It will be unhappy if it's left under your possession. I advise you to sell it to me. It's the best choice you can make for yourself and for the sword!"</p>

  <p>Apparently, according to this crazed maniac, Zheng had to give him his sword with three reasons: first, he collected swords and treated them as friends; second, his cultivation did not match with it; third, it was going to be sad if it was left with him. Just what kind of logic was that?</p>

  <p>He had a lot of reasons to refute but Zheng didn't feel like it would be worth it. It seemed the only way to establish his prestige here in the Mist Palace was to fight someone so these warriors would stop messing with him. It seemed he had to do the same thing he did back when he was still in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Taking Zheng's silence as his refusal, Jim once again spoke through the door, "Don't be so silly and reckless. If I fight with you, you're just going to end up losing an arm or a leg..."</p>

  <p>And with that, Jim slowly walked towards the palace entrance, fully intent on entering Zheng's abode.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew Zheng was definitely not going to hand over the weapon willingly. Jim, on the other hand, was a powerful warrior of the Swallow Cloud House. They couldn't help but sigh, knowing Zheng was going to suffer under Jim's hands.</p>

  <p>Inside the palace, Zheng's eyes suddenly opened. He sat cross-legged on the floor and waited.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword lay still in his hands and Xun watched as his eyes grew sharper with each passing moment.</p>

  <p>Just as Jim was fifty feet away from the palace entrance, Zheng's arm shook and the sword suddenly trembled. The momentum of wind and thunder fused with his sword intent and a faint, invisible wave burst out.</p>

  <p>He hadn't used all of his strength since he wasn't intending on killing anyone. The Mist Palace's rules were still unknown to him since he was a newcomer. All he really wanted to do was to teach Jim a lesson.</p>

  <p>However, that formless wave had given Zheng a fright!</p>
