  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors outside of the city saw the city wall, which was more than ten miles wide, begin to collapse like dominoes.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the warriors who were watching the fight on the city wall all quickly fled to avoid being trampled by the debris.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>During the chasing, Luo Luo Zheng thrust again with his sword. Eddie did not dodge in time, and so the sword left a long and narrow wound in his chest, causing blood to spill out.</p>

  <p>If this happened earlier in the fight, right after Eddie activated his fiend bloodline and a special layer of scales appeared on his skin, Luo Luo Zheng probably would not be able to cause him much harm.</p>

  <p>After all, even when Luo Luo Zheng was using all his attacking methods, he could not break through Eddie's defense.</p>

  <p>But now the situation was vastly different.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Double Star Brilliance had completely burnt Eddie's outer layer of skin off, and the flesh underneath that was very tender and utterly defenseless. It would take him a long period of time to fully recover and regain his previous defense. Because of that, he was unable to defend himself against the top-grade sacred weapon that Luo Luo Zheng was yielding.</p>

  <p>If Eddie knew that Luo Luo Zheng was still alive and that he would chase after him to kill him, he would have left the vicinity a long time ago and would have hidden in a remote place to recuperate and wait for his body's defenses to fully be back on their prime before returning.</p>

  <p>But that was neither here nor there. He was now facing Luo Luo Zheng with his body completely vulnerable to attacks and his strength greatly decreased.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chased him from one section of the city wall to another. From time to time, the figures of the two fighting warriors would appear among the shattered parts of the city wall. Everyone became dumbstruck the moment they saw this scene.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is really fierce. He is not afraid of Eddie at all. I thought he had been killed by Eddie, but I was wrong. He appeared again and began hunting Eddie. Wow! I admire him so much!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's power is no longer something we could comprehend. His strength cannot be measured merely by his cultivation. Although his level is lower than Eddie's, Eddie is nowhere near matching his strength!"</p>

  <p>"We're going to win! I can't believe he could really kill Eddie!"</p>

  <p>The unbelievable scene unfolding before their very eyes immediately made the morale of the warriors in Oracle City rise. By the look of what was happening, the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall were being miraculously saved single-handedly by Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Finally, Eddie was able to get past the city wall and out of the city. As soon as he did, he ran towards Simon screaming, "Simon, help!"</p>

  <p>Eddie, who was the number one warrior in the Central Region, was being chased by a man who was only twenty years old and had a lower cultivation level than his. With that, his reputation already took a nosedive.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, this tale would spread throughout the region's tea houses and restaurants, and would be the talk of the town in no time. The story would then be enthusiastically repeated until the end of time by people looking to make their mates cry with laughter. Eddie would become the laughing stock of martial artists and mortals all around the world.</p>

  <p>Hearing Eddie's cry for help, Simon came rushing to him. Eddie dying was a scenario not in his favor!</p>

  <p>However, how would the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance let Simon help Eddie? Before Simon even had a chance to make a move. the three leaders already surrounded him in an attempt to stop him from helping Eddie.</p>

  <p>Simon gave Dillon a weird smile and asked in a cold voice, "Do you really think you can stop me?"</p>

  <p>Simon had fought alongside Dillon, Hobbes, and Haber for a long time, and it seemed that the three of them could stall him. However, the truth was Simon had been conserving his forces all this time.</p>

  <p>Even if all the sects in the Central Region were wiped out by the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom, the beneficiary would be Eddie, not Simon. Simon, a warrior at the Life and Death Realm, was not that generous enough to be willing to give up the Central Region to Eddie.</p>

  <p>And so he made sure that he had his full force intact, because when the right time came, he would naturally clash with Eddie and take everything from him.</p>

  <p>But as of that moment, Simon couldn't risk getting Eddie killed.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Simon's lips curved into a sly smile, as streaks of black life vitality suddenly appeared before him and transformed into hundreds of black snakes, flying towards the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>The little snakes that appeared and writhed in midair were like real living venomous snakes. They all showed their vicious fangs as they flew towards Dillon and the others.</p>

  <p>Transforming life vitality into snakes was something that any warrior at nature level could do. All they needed to do was visualize a real snake.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors would be able to do so in a lifelike manner.</p>

  <p>However, the dangers did not solely lie on how they looked. The poison contained within them was something that would put fear in any man's heart.</p>

  <p>It was only right to name Simon as the "Poison King." He had practiced the internal version of the Scripture of Five Poisons and because of it, his skills with poison had greatly improved to a level that he was virtually unmatched when it came to it. With this attack, the level of poison he used was something that ordinary warriors would not be able to bear.</p>

  <p>The three leaders carefully dodged the black venomous snakes. As they were occupied with that, Simon was able to rush towards Eddie. His body then began to emit multicolored lights to a point that he was basically shining.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! Be careful! He's coming! Don't touch Simon!" Dillon cried out as he continuously dealt with the black snakes that were swamping him and the others. That was the only thing he could do for Luo Luo Zheng at the moment.</p>

  <p>The brighter the color, the stronger the poison!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng cast a glance at Simon before returning his gaze to Eddie. To other warriors, Simon's Scripture of Five Poisons was most likely a fatal existence. Even Eddie was afraid of it. However, to Luo Luo Zheng, it was all useless.</p>

  <p>He had a top-grade fairy weapon's physique, and any kind of poison would not be able to affect him.</p>

  <p>After Simon waved his hand, a colorful net appeared. It headed towards Luo Zheng's direction. Before it could cover him, a fishy smell assaulted his nose.</p>

  <p>"Let's see if you can survive under my net!" Simon shouted as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng with an evil grin.</p>

  <p>This poisonous net was made of eighty-one kinds of poisonous creatures in the Central Region, and was refined with the method found in the internal version of the Scripture of Five Poisons. Eddie would not dare to be enveloped by such a poisonous net, let alone a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Furthermore, according to the internal version of the Scripture of Five Poisons, even warriors at the Soul Sea Realm would die the moment they were covered by the poisonous net.</p>

  <p>For this main reason, many warriors were afraid of fighting against warriors cultivating poison skills. As long as one had deadly poisons, he or she would be able to kill any warrior whose cultivation level was significantly much higher.</p>

  <p>Simon saw the poisonous net cover Luo Luo Zheng completely, and by the looks of it, Luo Luo Zheng did not fear anything. His gaze never left Eddie, and he did not even spare the poisonous net a single glance.</p>

  <p>'Is this guy crazy?' Simon thought, his expression immediately changing.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a large hole appeared on the poisonous net, and only a portion of it ended up hanging on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"If you ignore my poisonous net, you will have to pay a painful price!"</p>

  <p>Simon shouted as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng. The poison on the net would take effect very quickly and it would spread throughout a warrior's body as his or her life vitality circulated. If everything went right, Luo Luo Zheng would live for, at most, thirty seconds.</p>

  <p>"Down!"</p>

  <p>"Down!"</p>

  <p>"Down!"</p>

  <p>"Down!"</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds! Sixty seconds! Ninety seconds!</p>

  <p>The corner of Simon's mouth started to twitch. Only then did he admit, though unwillingly, that his poisonous net had no effect on Luo Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>'What kind of monster is this brat?' he thought, fuming with anger. Simon sighed in his heart just as Eddie did when he realized that Luo Luo Zheng was no ordinary warrior. After all, he knew that his poisonous net was on par with Eddie's Life and Death Wind. It having no effect on Luo Luo Zheng shocked him immensely.</p>

  <p>Dillon, Hobbes and Haber were still struggling with the snakes, but were closely following what was happening below. All of them had huge smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng truly had the ability to stabilize any chaotic situation.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng buried his sword into Eddie's back again.</p>

  <p>Eddie was at the end of his rope, while Luo Luo Zheng had just undergone a cycle of reincarnation. The two were completely different in terms of physicality and mentality.</p>

  <p>As the sword pierced through Eddie's body, Luo Zheng's forceful energy burst forth, pushing the sword down harder. It once again pierced through Eddie's chest, pinning him to the ground. Eddie was down, and had a very low chance to get up once again.</p>

  <p>But how could Eddie be willing to give up?</p>

  <p>The moment he was nailed to the ground, he was about to jump up, but Luo Luo Zheng was already one step ahead. Luo Luo Zheng stomped on his chest, pushing him further to the ground.</p>

  <p>"It's over," Luo Luo Zheng said as he placed his hand on the hilt of his sword. His stare at Eddie was with finality.</p>

  <p>Eddie raised his head and looked at Luo Luo Zheng, his eyes finally showing signs of panic. This sect war was a sure win for him, and he was so close to establishing his own divine kingdom. But thanks to this little brat, the situation had turned for the worse and over a hundred thousand independent warriors were all dead! Now, he himself would be killed by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>How could Eddie be willing to accept his failure?</p>

  <p>Just then, a strange smile suddenly appeared on Eddie's lips. "It's over? Ha-ha! It's still far away from over! "</p>
