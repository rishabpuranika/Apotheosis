  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hamlin volunteered to go, surprising Nicholas quite a bit.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>With their universes, Holy beings could not really be killed. But there were always unprecedented factors that led to accidents.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas led people to chase after Lorena, some of the Holy Beings fell into the Lethal Fire Magma and perished. Lorena had somehow cut off the Holy Beings' connection to the universes for the time being, meaning that their deaths were absolute without any chance of them being reborn again.</p>

  <p>Now, the people they were to face were those from the outer world. No one knew what sort of token they had.</p>

  <p>Going ahead meant taking great risks.</p>

  <p>"If you're willing to go, that's good. I swear to ensure the safety of your universe!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas said in a serious tone. Because Nicholas had promised to ensure Hamlin's universe's safety, that meant securing Hamlin's very life, as well as the position of the Zhao Clan above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Hamlin smiled at that. "Holy Nicholas' words always count. I have no more worries!"</p>

  <p>"The sooner we go, the better. Let's set off now," Hamish said flatly.</p>

  <p>In spite of his calm demeanor, Hamish could feel the anxiety in his heart.</p>

  <p>As a powerful master at the Other Shore Realm, Hamish had always believed that the Yellow Emperor Guards had full control of the overall situation.</p>

  <p>So long as the Mixed Element Seal was removed, it meant the freedom of his many fellowmen? it wouldn't be long until they could take down the divine land.</p>

  <p>But when he suddenly heard of the arrival of someone from the outside world, an ominous sense of foreboding filled his mind.</p>

  <p>He was eager to confirm the people's strength and stand, so he needed to see for himself.</p>

  <p>"The space channel they built has penetrated my Murphy Universe. I think they should be at the very top. Hamlin, you can reach there through my Murphy Universe. If you don't mind. I'll create a space channel first.</p>

  <p>Hamlin, Nicholas, and Master Hamish, follow me," Murphy suggested.</p>

  <p>A universe could only accommodate three True Gods simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Such was the number Nicholas had set after modifying the rule on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Because the Holy Beings, in essence, were also consummate True Gods, it was impossible for Murphy to invite all the Holy Beings in the Goldenrain Hall into the Murphy Universe? they'd trigger the Ruling Slate and be punished by it accordingly.</p>

  <p>For now, he could only invite Nicholas, Hamlin, and Hamish into his Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>But as for Murphy himself, the creator of the universe, he wasn't limited by such a rule. .</p>

  <p>Nicholas and Hamish exchanged nods. Then, Murphy reached out his hand and started using Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>An invisible space fluctuation rose upward, instantly connecting him to the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>Hamlin, Nicholas, and Hamish followed along the space fluctuation and also employed the Grand Teleportation. They went after Murphy into the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>Atop the Murphy Universe was a light-green star.</p>

  <p>To the pseudo-Sacred race in this universe, it was the largest and brightest star, a keeper of countless mysterious legends.</p>

  <p>Many masters of the Murphy Universe dreamed of reaching this star.</p>

  <p>But after reaching a certain height, they'd encounter an invisible "space wall". No matter how hard they tried, the wall prevented them from making it through.</p>

  <p>For creatures in this world, the star was like a flower in the mirror? a moon in the water that they could see and aspire to obtain but never touch.</p>

  <p>No one was aware that it was merely a temporary palace Murphy had built in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As space fluctuated, Murphy had appeared in the palace on the star.</p>

  <p>With a point of his finger?</p>

  <p>A colorful bush of flowers bloomed in an instant, the faint fragrance spreading over the entire palace.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Nicholas, Hamish, and Hamlin appeared before him.</p>

  <p>"That space channel has been constructed in that direction." Murphy pointed.</p>

  <p>Hamlin took his glance and nodded without a word.</p>

  <p>A little deviation was acceptable to a Holy Being. Only a thought was necessary to use Grand Teleportation and cross the distance, after all.</p>

  <p>Murphy, Hamish, and Nicholas each attached a wisp of their soul to Hamlin before he activated Grand Teleportation, took a step forward, and entered the space channel.</p>

  <p>It was connected to the chaos outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>Roaming about this chaos was an almost compulsory course for Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>After the consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings became Holy Beings in the Mountain of Holy Beings, they developed an extreme curiosity for the world outside the divine land, as they had already reached the peak level in the divine land. If they wanted to reach a higher level, they could only seek chances outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>But most Holy Beings were met only with disappointment after traveling through chaos.</p>

  <p>Save for the large space of chaos, there was nearly nothing else there.</p>

  <p>The majority of Holy Beings flew around the divine land a few times before accepting disappointment and returning to the divine land and working on their clans' development, making their Floating Islands notably powerful in the divine land.</p>

  <p>This was Hamlin's second time out of the divine land.</p>

  <p>When he stood atop it, his vision grew wide.</p>

  <p>His view of the world from there was extremely vast? he saw nothing in the broad space. Where were the people he was looking for?</p>

  <p>Standing still, he narrowed his eyes as his spiritual sense spread to all directions around him.</p>

  <p>A thousand miles, ten thousand miles, a hundred thousand miles?</p>

  <p>In another place atop the divine land?</p>

  <p>Emily stood in the air as a colorful ring spun underneath her.</p>

  <p>At the center of this colorful ring were high-speed spinning space waves? they formed an enormous spatial spiral, constantly drilling into the restriction barrier in space.</p>

  <p>She had held this position for a long time.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Ramzi, Leopold, and the female warriors of the Snake Goddess race remained sitting cross-legged with their eyes shut.</p>

  <p>Breaking through the restriction barrier was undoubtedly a time and energy-consuming act? they were prepared for the long haul.</p>

  <p>"Master, you've been holding on for over half a month. We can take over," said a Snake Goddess warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Emily only smiled faintly in return. "This is nothing. I will feel nothing even after doing this for a year or so."</p>

  <p>"But we also..." The warrior trailed off, a strange look appearing on her expression.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Timotheus, Ramzi, and Leopold opened their eyes.</p>

  <p>They felt a faint wisp of spiritual sense spread over them.</p>

  <p>"Who is spying on us?" Leopold said, knitting his brows.</p>

  <p>"It's merely a consummate True God? No? this person is stronger than ordinary consummate True Gods," Timotheus added.</p>

  <p>"Hmph. No matter who it is, we'll find out after I catch the person.</p>

  <p>Cecelia, take my place and continue working!" Emily sneered and disappeared from where she stood.</p>

  <p>Cecelia, the powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm, then replaced Emily and continued drilling into the restriction barrier below.</p>
