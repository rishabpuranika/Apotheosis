  <p>
</p>

  <p>The temperature kept increasing at a high speed!</p>

  <p>"With the violent flow of all the energy, the temperature will rise," the woman said lightly.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>After the temperature reached a limit, the force of primitive fear unexpectedly turned into a light brown flame that bloomed in her hand.</p>

  <p>Then, with a gentle pinch of her fingers, the brown energy and flame disappeared without a trace. "In the same way, if the energy stays completely still, the temperature will decrease and it will release absolute coldness."</p>

  <p>"You mean the cold air?" Zheng had already more or less figured this out.</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of powerful clans were also hit with the realization of what was happening around them. With a mixture of curiosity and excitement, they started to whisper amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>"It can directly control the flow of the energy. What kind of ability is it?"</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, then wouldn't the True Demon Body be able to freeze anything?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you feel it yourself?"</p>

  <p>Just now, all of them had endured the cold air while being attacked by the Cold Fiends.</p>

  <p>They knew just how strong the cold air was...</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the cold air," the woman said lightly, staring at Zheng. "The True Demon Body is divided into two forms. One is the forward-flowing form, that is the red light ball... The other is the reverse-flowing form, that is the blue light ball. If we break these light balls, we can obtain the True Demon Body!"</p>

  <p>Although the woman had casually said these words, Zheng had a vague feeling that the two light balls wouldn't be so easy to break.</p>

  <p>"If it were really so easy to do that, I think you would have already obtained the True Demon Body. Why did you wait for us to come?"</p>

  <p>Clark said from behind.</p>

  <p>The others immediately nodded their heads in agreement. This woman had stayed in the Abyss Demon Region for many years and knew much more about this place than they did. If she could easily break the light balls on her own, she wouldn't have waited until now to do it.</p>

  <p>"You're right. I can't do it all by myself," the woman said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"The two energy light balls are dependent on the True Demon Body as well as on each other. Their energies are interchangeable. If the red light ball is attacked, all the energy in it will be solidified and sent to the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>If the blue light ball is attacked, all its energy will become more active and flow to the red light ball. For countless years, the energy has been bouncing back and forth between these two balls. If you came here just a year later, you would not see an ice palace at the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region; instead, you would see a fire palace! This ice coffin wouldn't be an ice coffin, but a fire coffin. Even this ice volcano would become a real volcano!"</p>

  <p>The environment where the True Demon Body rested transformed once every ten years or so.</p>

  <p>The ice palace had been maintained for nine years so far...</p>

  <p>"A year later..." Zheng murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng understood that the environment of the ice coffin depended on the flow of the energy.</p>

  <p>The more active the energy was, the hotter the coffin would become. When the energy was stagnant, the place would become cold and snowy.</p>

  <p>Now, the energy was slowly getting more active...</p>

  <p>So, the blue light ball was far weaker than the red one.</p>

  <p>"Everyone has to work together to change the energy flow," the woman said, staring at the red light ball. "Now, more than ninety percent of the energy has accumulated within the red light ball. So if we keep attacking the blue light ball, the True Demon Body will naturally transfer the energy to the red light ball. If we keep channeling energy to the red light ball, we will be able to make it swell and explode! "</p>

  <p>"Isn't that a stupid method?"</p>

  <p>"This light ball is only around tens of thousands of feet wide. Can't we just split it open?"</p>

  <p>"After all, they are just two masses of energy..."</p>

  <p>Some of the Demi-holy Beings and Holy Beings lowered their heads in discussion. They seemed to have formed a temporary alliance to discuss countermeasures.</p>

  <p>After working together to break the light ball, they could then fight with each other for the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>Hearing these discussions, the woman raised her head slightly, revealing a look of contempt. "As great Holy Beings from the divine land, all of you have some extraordinary powers and skills. Just give it a try!"</p>

  <p>"Okay. Let me have a try!"</p>

  <p>Zeke, the Holy Being of the Fang Clan, said, stepping forward.</p>

  <p>"Father, be careful," reminded Shahn.</p>

  <p>He believed that the woman was not someone they could trust. She had told them a lot of things, but he was not sure if those things were true or made up.</p>

  <p>What if Zeke's efforts ended up irritating the True Demon Body? Shahn personally felt that it was too much of a risk.</p>

  <p>Zeke nodded slightly, and then stretched out his hands.</p>

  <p>A huge shadow appeared in the void and slowly took the shape of an illusory ax. Although it didn't seem to exist in this realm, it was emitting a powerful aura.</p>

  <p>"Zeke, did you get this ax in the Soul Wilderness? I've never seen you use it before!" Clark said.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had obtained a lot of powerful weapons through the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>However, it was in the Soul Wilderness that Zeke had obtained this ax, the powerful, five-star supreme treasure of belief.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, Zeke pointed his finger at the huge illusory ax.</p>

  <p>Everyone heard a wail of pain coming from the huge ax. A turbulent force surged out of it and immediately slashed at the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>Hoo!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The moment the huge ax made contact with the blue light ball, a cold light flashed on the ball's surface.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The blue light ball redirected the force from the ax to the red light ball, where it turned into a flame.</p>

  <p>As for the huge ax, it had frozen to ice.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, as a supreme treasure of belief, the huge ax couldn't be destroyed. As Zeke gently waved his hand, the huge ax shrank and disappeared in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>"The two light balls coordinate with each other and transfer their energy to each other. How can they be broken?" Zeke shook his head, admitting defeat.</p>

  <p>"Let me give it a try!"</p>

  <p>Clark shouted priggishly.</p>

  <p>He wanted to have a try after watching Zeke take action.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled faintly. "You can give it a try, but it's useless for you to do it alone. The only reason I didn't kill you before is because your Elementary Fire Godly Way is very important."</p>
