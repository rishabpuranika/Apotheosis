  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eddie brought his disciples to compete in the Martial Arts Contest, and it would be improper for him to kill a young warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm during the competition.</p>

  <p>All the people in the world would laugh at him. Despite being a dignified top-ranked warrior in the Central Region, he could not afford to lose? that was what people were going to say about him if he killed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the three fat men from the World Commercial Alliance would not allow such a thing to happen. Moreover, there was an older woman, a powerful master who stood behind Cloud Hall. And she might be watching the scene from somewhere now.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance also had an Ancient Tycoon, who had lived for over a thousand years. Although he was very old, his power was too deep to be fathomable. If it were a one-on-one fight, Eddie would not be afraid of any of them. But if these men came together to fight him, as powerful as Eddie was, he would not be able to battle them all.</p>

  <p>After careful consideration, Eddie restrained his impulse to rip Luo Luo Zheng to shreds, and opted for another way to vent his anger. He decided to utilize the force of his powerful soul to suppress Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If Ning Yudie were to stand in front of Luo Luo Zheng to protect him, Eddie would have trouble carrying out his plan, as he might have to hurt the leader of Cloud Hall first. But he didn't expect that Luo Luo Zheng would step forward and pull Ning Yudie aside.</p>

  <p>"Since you want to be a hero and court death, then no one can help you!"</p>

  <p>Eddie was pleased in his heart, but he appeared calm. Considering the powerful force of his soul, if he wanted to crush the soul of a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm, it would be as easy as a wheel crushing a mantis.</p>

  <p>The moment his powerful soul Mu Ning emerged, it soared toward Luo Luo Zheng with great momentum, as if it had the power to send rocks to hit the clouds and use waves to tear the shore apart. It caused a strong wind and forced its way toward Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Despite facing with the terrifying pressure, Luo Luo Zheng stood straight, a faint smile spreading across his face. At this moment, he was like a reef in the ocean, no matter how forcefully Eddie's pressure was hitting him, Luo Luo Zheng remained steadfast and unmoved.</p>

  <p>The raging wind blew off one of Yudie's golden hairpins from her hair. Her soft hair was unbound, and it fluttered in the wind. She snuggled against Luo Zheng's shoulder and used her hands to brush her hair away from her eyes.</p>

  <p>Then, she raised her head and stared at the heroic figure in front of her.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng calmly handling Eddie's suppression, Ning Yudie forgot that she should feel surprised. She was so lost in her thoughts that she wasn't paying any attention to what was happening around them.</p>

  <p>She remembered that her family had moved from the Northern Region to the Central Region when she was very young.</p>

  <p>She stayed in a carriage during their long and tedious journey. The cold wind howled. Her parents had wrapped her with a warm quilt, the only quilt they had, to keep her warm and keep out the cold. She would occasionally poke her head out of the quilt and crane her neck toward the carriage window. When she felt the chilling wind blowing outside, she realized how fortunate and happy she was to be protected in the warm carriage.</p>

  <p>It was on that night that her whole family, thirty-seven people, including her parents and extended family members, were killed. However, she was lucky enough to be saved by a Cloud Hall disciple who was passing by. It was because of him that she had escaped death and survived.</p>

  <p>Later, she was brought to the Cloud School, an organization affiliated to Cloud Hall. Her astonishing talent was first noticed there, and she made her way up to Cloud Hall... and finally became what she was now, a superior figure in the Central Region, the leader of a top-ranking fourth-grade sect!</p>

  <p>Later on, Ning Yudie found out what happened that night. It turned out that a third-grade sect had mistakenly exterminated her entire family.</p>

  <p>After acquiring enough power to enact her revenge, Ning Yudie went to the third-grade sect alone and wiped it away from the map of the Central Region. She annihilated the entire sect!</p>

  <p>At Cloud Hall, although Ning Yudie appeared immature, and sometimes she was very obstinate like a little girl, she still had her strong stance, like an iron lady. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to remain in power as the leader of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, even though she had avenged her family's death, which had weighed heavily on her, she was aware that the happiness lost in her childhood could no longer be retrieved. She still missed the time she spent when she was in that carriage, with her family members. As she listened to the horse's hooves galloping down the road, the north wind blew past her like a knife scraping against her face, and she was then tucked away in the warm quilt, feeling lucky that she didn't have to suffer from the cold or hunger.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng pulled her into his arms, Ning Yudie felt that she had returned to that time when she was wrapped in the quilt. This young man used his body, though not an imposing feature, to shoulder everything himself and keep all the danger from her. It made her feel very warm. It was the little warmth that belonged only to her.</p>

  <p>The wind quietly dissipated, and the pressure gradually disappeared. Luo Luo Zheng had worn a smile throughout. He had confidently glared at the Evil East Lord, who stood not far away.</p>

  <p>Eddie's eyes were filled with doubt. Soon, the doubt became surprise, and finally, his eyes dimmed as helplessness flooded him. Different feelings struck him within a short moment. He had already released the power of the suppression to perform at its maximum level. In a certain sense, it was equivalent to launching an attack toward Luo Zheng's soul, but in a disguised form.</p>
