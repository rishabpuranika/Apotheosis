<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whether it was in the Central Region or in this chaotic continent, cultivating soul was the most difficult task for warriors.</p>

  <p>Although this ogre war lord was extremely powerful and the ogre race had a secret method of cultivating soul, the war lord Zheng was facing hadn't reached the Fighting Soul Realm yet.</p>

  <p>The ogre war lord was certain that Zheng couldn't destroy his soul as he had a secret weapon, which could protect his soul. But there was still a good chance that Zheng might be able to damage his soul, so the war lord was wary of the oncoming attack.</p>

  <p>They cautiously distanced themselves from each other.</p>

  <p>However, what was even more distressing for Zheng was that the other two ogre war lords were coming up...</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth and once again activated the forceful energy within him, which was starting to drain. His body turned into a thin thread once again and whizzed forward.</p>

  <p>The situation was very grave and Zheng was in a real soup this time.</p>

  <p>The Central Region was dangerous, but he had always been able to defeat his opponents with the protection of the Cloud Hall. Although his opponents' cultivation levels were usually one realm higher than Zheng's, they were on par in terms of true strength!</p>

  <p>But this situation was totally different.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a seventh level war fighter, but according to the ranking system of the chaotic continent, the war general ranked above the war fighter and the war lord ranked above the war general.</p>

  <p>This meant that the war lord was two realms higher than Zheng according to the ranking system in this continent. Moreover, there were three ogre war lords fighting Zheng right now.</p>

  <p>If he was an ordinary war fighter, perhaps, he would have already been killed, but Zheng had managed to escape for over a thousand miles with his life vitality and forceful energy working to his advantage at the same time.</p>

  <p>But running was never a good solution.</p>

  <p>If the three ogre war lords attacked him together, Zheng knew he wouldn't be able to deal with them simultaneously.</p>

  <p>'What should I do?' he thought desperately. Faced with impending doom, Zheng asked the cyan dragon in his mind for help.</p>

  <p>"If there really is no other way, I can use my soul to attack and kill them," offered the cyan dragon calmly. "But I'm afraid that after that, my soul will fall into a deep sleep again."</p>

  <p>When the cyan dragon had devoured the Owl Beast's evil spirit, his soul got energized. A part of the Owl Beast's soul was used to awaken the red dragon. Zheng had used a small portion of that soul to create a soul seed, and the rest was devoured by the cyan dragon. The soul of the Owl Beast's evil spirit was very strong, but it was not enough for the Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>At this stage, the only solution was, as the cyan dragon suggested, one more soul attack.</p>

  <p>But if the cyan dragon went to 'sleep', it meant that he would once again turn into a lifeless statue atop the mysterious furnace.</p>

  <p>"No!" Zheng rejected the idea the moment the cyan dragon suggested it.</p>

  <p>Zheng wouldn't be what he was today without the cyan dragon's guidance.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had taught him to draw the divine texture. Besides, Zheng relied on the cyan dragon's advice in crucial matters. He simply couldn't let him fall asleep again.</p>

  <p>"But right now, there is no better way to deal with those ogres," said the cyan dragon, looking helpless.</p>

  <p>Be it the Heavenly Ogre Fist or the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death, they were useless in front of the ogre war lords. The only things that could pose a threat to them were the broken flying knife and Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>However, these weapons were unable to completely wipe out the ogre war lords.</p>

  <p>"Black flame!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps the black flame within the mysterious furnace was Zheng's last hope.</p>

  <p>This powerful weapon seemed to be able to destroy anything in the world and Zheng thought it might just become his final trump card.</p>

  <p>But Zheng couldn't control the black flame in the way that he wanted. In other words, the black flame had a soul, and all Zheng could do was summon it. He wasn't able to order the black flame to attack anyone. So, on further consideration, it seemed unwise to risk his life by pinning all his hopes on the black flame.</p>

  <p>Zheng was at his wits' end when a voice rang in his ears, "In the northwest, forty miles away, there are three transmission arrays. Go into the middle one. You can escape from there!"</p>

  <p>It dawned on him that this ethereal voice came from a member of the Demon Night, who had warned him not to advance further!</p>

  <p>Zheng knew he shouldn't trust the members of the Demon Night but the voice bore no malice. In any case, it would be better for him to fall into the hands of the Demon Night, against whom he at least had a fighting chance, than to be caught by the ogres.</p>

  <p>He didn't have much time to think. Without further ado, he changed his direction.</p>

  <p>Zheng carefully scanned the mountainous terrain in front of him to look for the transmission arrays that the voice had told him about.</p>

  <p>There were tall mountains covered by lush trees and all kinds of plants.</p>

  <p>After looking hard for a few seconds, Zheng spotted a strange mountain not too far away. The mountain seemed to have been halved by a sword. The upper half of the mountain lay horizontally at the side, while the lower half of the mountain was flattened, revealing a level ground.</p>

  <p>On the level ground, there were some circular patterns.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as a green light flashed in them. After his eyes were cleansed by the sap from the divine tree, not only was he able to see through illusions, his eyesight had improved greatly.</p>

  <p>"Three transmission arrays!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes twinkled at the sight of the transmission arrays and he immediately sped up.</p>

  <p>The three transmission arrays were set up together, but it was very likely that they might lead to different destinations. According to the message from the young lady of the Demon Night, Zheng was to enter the transmission array in the middle.</p>

  <p>But what if that transmission array led him to the area inhabited by the Demon Night? He would be captured by them!</p>

  <p>It was such a critical moment. Zheng felt completely lost.</p>

  <p>He looked up and took a deep breath. Calm down, he reminded himself. In such circumstances, all he could do was take a gamble and pray that he would be safe.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng dove down at the speed of light. He crashed into the ground and bounced into the transmission array in the middle. As soon as he balanced himself, more than a dozen supreme life vitality crystals flew out from the space ring that hung on his chest.</p>

  <p>With a casual wave of his hand the supreme life vitality crystals instantly embedded themselves into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>"Buzz…"</p>

  <p>A blazing white light began to rotate rapidly in the transmission array.</p>

  <p>"Faster! Come on!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had exhausted the last bit of his forceful energy, but the three ogre war lords were still in hot pursuit. The ogre war lords had almost caught up with him.</p>

  <p>Just as they arrived above the mountain, a blazing white light engulfed Zheng.</p>

  <p>The next moment he disappeared into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>"Damn, the human brat escaped!" The ogre war lord in the lead roared angrily.</p>

  <p>"Keep going!" said another ogre war lord who kicked away the supreme life vitality crystals that Zheng had placed on the transmission array. Then, he took out several life vitality crystals of his own and put them on the transmission array. The transmission array would consume all the life vitality in the life vitality crystals, so new crystals had to be used each time to make it work again.</p>

  <p>The three ogre war lords wasted no time and jumped into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>After they disappeared in the transmission array, a young girl named Phoebe, from the Demon Night, also landed gracefully on the level ground.</p>

  <p>She sauntered towards the transmission array and pulled out the supreme life vitality crystals that were embedded on the transmission array one by one, then she placed her own supreme life vitality crystals onto it.</p>

  <p>When she was finished, she let out a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Moments before, she had been anxiously chasing after them.</p>

  <p>Phoebe didn't know why the queen would hang around with Zheng. She had to figure out the mystery, and so she had followed them.</p>

  <p>"But that young man doesn't trust me. He could have run straight to our Demon Night. When Elder Mei arrives, those ogres will all die. Although this guy is only a human war fighter, he runs very fast, so at least he's safe right now." Saying this, she leaped into the transmission array elegantly.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night creatures maintained their poise under all circumstances.</p>

  <p>The transmission array was a small one, capable of sending someone 10, 000 miles away. It didn't take long before Zheng passed through this channel and came out the other end.</p>

  <p>As the incandescent white light gradually dissipated, Zheng saw a desolate world lie in front of him!</p>

  <p>All he could see was grey plains. There was no other color and everything looked lifeless in this barren place. It was as if life had never existed here.</p>

  <p>'What kind of place is this?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Smiling wryly, Zheng crushed another supreme life vitality crystal to replenish his life vitality and, at the same time, he prepared to fly into the air.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to leap into the air, an extremely powerful force pushed him back down on the ground!</p>

  <p>The surge of power was so formidable that it didn't allow Zheng to resist in the slightest bit.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful restraining force! This is a no-fly ban!" Zheng felt a chill in his heart. He was getting more and more confused. Normally, no-fly bans were only used in sects. Why was there such a powerful no-fly ban in this uninhabited land? What the hell was this place?</p>

  <p>Just then, a blazing white light flashed behind Zheng and three enormous figures popped out from the light. They were the three ogre war lords who had chased him for more than a thousand miles!</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened immediately. Despite using the transmission array, he hadn't managed to escape them. Now the only option for him was to put his life on the line and go all out.</p>
