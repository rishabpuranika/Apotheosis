<br/><br/>

  

  <p>If he really fought with Aleyna, he must learn to hide his moves, or he would be easily seen through.</p>

  <p>But Han Liusu was thinking the same as Luo Zheng. She knew that Zheng's strength far exceeded the strengths of people at the same level as him, but he didn't have as many tricks. Now, Aleyna was much stronger than before, so she thought that it would be difficult for Luo Zheng to hide his tricks before her.</p>

  <p>These thoughts wreaked havoc in Zheng's and Liusu's minds.</p>

  <p>But the battle between Luo Zheng and Aleyna did not start.</p>

  <p>Because at this moment, the door on the other side of the hall was pushed open with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>More than a hundred people rushed into the hall. They weren't very strong but they exuded an extraordinary Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Some of these people were proving godly warriors, and the others were low-rank True Gods. Most of them were very young. While the proving godly warriors were only 16 or 17 years old, the low-rank True Gods were only in their early twenties. They were all dressed informally but their clothes were all very fancy. Some had cyan-winged phoenixes embroidered on their shoulders, while some had gold dragons on their sleeves. They must belong to influential clans.</p>

  <p>In addition to these warriors, there were four top-rank True Gods, who were hiding their Mu Ning and keeping a low profile. What was more, they were only the bodyguards of some of these young people.</p>

  <p>"No outsider is allowed to enter this place!" Grant frowned and stepped up to stand before them. He said, "It doesn't matter who you are. Please get out!"</p>

  <p>Since the Princess Royal had come here, all the others on the Han Clan's Floating Island must avoid being seen. No resistance was allowed.</p>

  <p>The fifteen year old man at the front shook his head and laughed as he said, "What? I can't hear you."</p>

  <p>"This guy told us to get out! Ha-ha! Can you hear me now?" Another young man in blue whispered loudly to the young man in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off! I think I'm going to be deaf!"</p>

  <p>"Lower your voice. The two princesses of the Han Clan are here today.</p>

  <p>Don't embarrass Lang!"</p>

  <p>Now that these young people had stirred up trouble, the quiet hall had suddenly descended into a mess.</p>

  <p>Grant's face darkened. He gritted his teeth and made to attack.</p>

  <p>As a top-rank True God, dealing with these juniors was easy for Grant.</p>

  <p>But he had barely made a move when two top-rank True Gods blocked his path.</p>

  <p>"Hey buddy. You'd better stay out of young people's businesses," one of them whispered threateningly to Grant.</p>

  <p>"I just want to protect my princesses," Grant said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Our young master can't be hurt either. Don't force us to do anything," the man continued, his voice low. "Leave the matter to them. If they make a scene, there will be people above them to solve it. Anyone who tries to get involved will only be smashed to pieces. Do you understand what I'm saying?"</p>

  <p>These top-rank True Gods had always been the bodyguards around the core disciples of the wealthy clans. They were already familiar with the rules. They knew that they couldn't be too responsible for their behaviors, or they would suffer from their own actions.</p>

  <p>The Floating Islands above the Time Sea were the core of power. If accidentally involved, ordinary people would be torn to pieces. Even top-rank True Gods were no exception.</p>

  <p>Grant had just been transferred from the Holy Emperor City to the Spiritual Heart Hall, so he didn't know the rules. He just wanted to fulfill his duty and ensure Liusu's and Aleyna's safety. He couldn't bear to see these playboys from all the wealthy clans rushing in like nobody was watching them.</p>

  <p>But the man's words calmed him down. As long as these people didn't move towards the princesses, Grant would not act rashly. Although Grant was a top-rank True God, he couldn't afford to offend the hundred people present.</p>

  <p>Noticing that the others weren't showing them any respect, Aleyna, Han Liusu and Kelsey were angry. "Why are you here?" Han Liusu asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Don't treat us as outsiders. You and Lang are engaged. You're his fiancee. I don't think it's a big deal for him to see his wife! Don't you agree with me?" A young bald man chuckled as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Liusu's expression hardened at this. She couldn't help but glance at Tianxing. Disappointment crushed her heart as she saw Zheng's stiff expression.</p>

  <p>Before anyone could react, the mass of people parted to reveal a handsome man slowly making his way to the front of the crowd. He smiled at her and said, "Han Liusu! Nice to meet you again!"</p>

  <p>This was Langston Leng, also known as Lang.</p>

  <p>The Leng Clan was ranked fourth among all the wealthy clans of the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Even among those in the top ten, the Leng Clan was one of the biggest and most powerful clans. And even in the divine land outside the Time Sea, the surname "Leng" alone could make anyone feel inferior.</p>

  <p>The Han and the Qin Clans used to be on good terms with each other, their clan members often marrying each other. So both clans had children and disciples in each other's clans.</p>

  <p>But by this time, the relationship between the Qin Clan and the Han Clan had started to crack.</p>

  <p>Rumor was that if the Qin Clan wanted to be among the top ten clans, they had to remove the Hans from the list. But the Han Clan had no intention of giving up their ranking. As a result, the relationship between the two clans, which used to be linked by marriage, had now dropped to freezing point.</p>

  <p>The other evidence was the marriage of Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>The Holy Emperor of the Han Clan had many children, but most of them were men. It wasn't until this divine era that he finally had the luck to beget two daughters, Han Liusu and Aleyna, on both of whom, the Holy Emperor obviously doted.</p>

  <p>Since they were the biological daughters of the Holy Emperor, they enjoyed a high status in the Han Clan. Some had thought that the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan would marry off his eldest daughter, Han Liusu, to someone in the Qin Clan. However, as their relationship fell apart, Han Liusu became engaged to Langston, of the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>Everyone was focused on the relationship between the Han Clan and the Leng Clan as well as the possible problems that could crop up in the future. Above the Time Sea, every move of the wealthy clans remained mysterious. They were thus, trying to guess the underhanded meaning of the marriage between the Leng Clan and the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>But despite being the bride, Han Liusu was neglected the most.</p>

  <p>No one cared about what she was thinking, or her talent, or her strength.</p>

  <p>They only knew her value and how she could be an advantage to them.</p>

  <p>And Han Liusu didn't attend the engagement.</p>

  <p>She then went to her father and made a scene. Despite that, her father had her grounded.</p>

  <p>According to the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan, Langston was the best man to marry Han Liusu and she was just creating trouble for nothing.</p>

  <p>People like Han Liusu weren't rare in the wealthy clans, but no one could disobey an order of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>She was not a mortal, so she couldn't just run away with the one she loved.</p>

  <p>Although the divine land was large, how could Han Liusu avoid being chased by a Holy Being?</p>

  <p>They all thought that Han Liusu would eventually compromise with her father after struggling for a while.</p>

  <p>Langston was an outstanding young man. In the Arena of Legends, he had ranked among the top five mid-rank True Gods, and had never fallen out in all these years. Langston was the youngest son of the Holy Being of the Leng Clan. His status was no worse than that of Han Liusu and it could be said that they were perfectly matched.</p>

  <p>Langston greeted her warmly, but Han Liusu was still pulling a long face and was avoiding looking at him.</p>

  <p>As he watched Han Liusu helplessly, Langston wanted to walk over to her.</p>

  <p>But Aleyna and Kelsey were staring coldly at him from either side of Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>"Stay away from her!"</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Although these two girls constantly fought with each other, they were very united when it came to guarding Han Liusu against him.</p>

  <p>"You two little girls, get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>"The girls of the Han Clan are really beautiful. The two girls might become more beautiful than their sister when they grow up!"</p>

  <p>"You can also ask your father to come here to propose marriage, can't you?"</p>

  <p>The playboys were straightforward and even began to comment on Aleyna and Kelsey. They didn't dither before saying something harsh.</p>

  <p>Even though Aleyna looked weak and feeble, she was tough, just like her mother. Their words brought her to the point of explosion, her round eyes widening as two blood shadows emerged from her hands.</p>

  <p>The two blood shadows dragged in her hands like two shapeless knives, and she jabbed them towards one of the playboys.</p>

  <p>She intended to kill them by using all her strength!</p>
