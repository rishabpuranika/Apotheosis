<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Holy Drew didn't dwell on this matter.</p>

  <p>He could only be considered half an insider and he would only secretly help Mike with his plan. Never would he get completely involved.</p>

  <p>After all, he was only a weapon refiner. The only thing he could do was display his specialties to the maximum, which meant refining Luo Zheng's body to a stronger level.</p>

  <p>"Dark and Light Fire Array!" Holy Drew roared.</p>

  <p>With those words, he began to activate his divine textures one after another, equally making use of the black flame.</p>

  <p>The Divine Flame Cauldron was also an ancient treasure within the divine land. The black flame inside such, along with the Sun Spring essence flame and mixed element flame, was ranked first on the Mysterious Flame List in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew wasn't proficient in dealing with the black flame, though.</p>

  <p>To him, obtaining just one of the three kinds of flames would be more than enough. Moreover, all the weapon refiners preferred the mixed element flame, because it was the best choice for weapon refining. The mixed element flame was relatively mild, but the black flame was too fierce; even the slightest mistake would cause the weapon embryo to be burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>It was both Holy Jay's and Mike's choices to refine Luo Zheng's body with the black flame. Thus, it was important for Holy Drew to be careful when handling the black flame.</p>

  <p>A white disc slowly appeared beneath Holy Drew's feet and white life vitality began to circulate around him. Simultaneously, the black flame in the void also began flowing like water toward the disc.</p>

  <p>As a result, a black and white eight-diagram disc was formed.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light Divine Dao was the Divine Dao that Holy Drew cultivated himself.</p>

  <p>The Divine Dao had once wielded great glory in the Sacred race of the divine land. Due to the Sacred race's decline though, from ancient history to today, those who had cultivated it to its pinnacle were few and far between. Not many warriors with this Divine Dao could successfully become Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew didn't become a Holy Being because of the Dark and Light Divine Dao. On the other hand though, his attainment in this Divine Dao was absolutely extraordinary.</p>

  <p>His overall purpose in cultivating the Dark and Light Divine Dao was still to refine weapons.</p>

  <p>Before this, no one had ever used the Dark and Light Divine Dao in weapon refining. Following the rise of Holy Drew like a dazzling star, many people turned their gazes toward him. The Dark and Light Divine Dao became popular among weapon refiners as well.</p>

  <p>They only had one goal, which was to learn from Holy Drew and use the Dark and Light Divine Dao to refine supreme chaotic weapons.</p>

  <p>There were quite a few weapon refiners exploring this Divine Dao in the divine land, but unfortunately, not a single one of them managed to create a supreme chaotic weapon. Furthermore, they all failed to comprehend the main points within. What they didn't know was that the key of refining supreme chaotic weapons wasn't in the Dark and Light Divine Dao at all.</p>

  <p>Once Holy Drew had successfully set up the Dark and Light Fire Array, he casually waved his hand and Luo Zheng's body gently landed in the middle of the array. Immediately, the eight-diagram disc started to revolve rapidly.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, he wasn't a man who followed the rules.</p>

  <p>Although he viewed Luo Luo Zheng as a rather ideal weapon embryo, he would not deliberately refine him into a supreme primordial weapon, or into a supreme chaotic weapon.</p>

  <p>Doing so would cause Luo Zheng's strength to increase in a short period of time, sure, but at the same time, it would also fix him at this said level? he would be unable to make any progress in the future.</p>

  <p>This time though, Holy Drew decided he was going to give it a try.</p>

  <p>"You can leave this place first. I'm pretty sure you don't want to stay in this boring place for too long," Holy Drew said to the nine Genuine Dragons.</p>

  <p>The nine Genuine Dragons didn't speak, but turned on a dime and headed toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Jay, change the time flow rate. He needs a long refining process," Holy Drew said to Holy Jay. He left Luo Luo Zheng alone on the eight-diagram disc and walked out the door as well.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded. Controlling time flow rate was not difficult for Holy Beings. With a casual wave of his hand, the door closed tightly once again. He began to change the time flow rate inside the door.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate behind the closed door began dropping rapidly, becoming abnormally slow.</p>

  <p>1:10...</p>

  <p>1:100...</p>

  <p>1:1, 000...</p>

  <p>1:10, 000...</p>

  <p>1:1 million...</p>

  <p>1:10 million...</p>

  <p>Outside the door, Holy Jay continued compressing the time flow rate inside.</p>

  <p>Tianming frowned slightly as he felt the Time Law escaping from the door.</p>

  <p>It was as if he had suddenly recalled something unpleasant.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had stayed in the secret place of Lord of Weapons for three hundred years, but that time flow rate had also been changed. In fact, outside of that secret place, only three years had passed. This kind of absolute loneliness had messed with and changed his state of mind.</p>

  <p>"What is the time flow rate inside the door right now?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>"About 1:30 million." Without hesitation, Holy Jay continued to change the time flow rate.</p>

  <p>Even though the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was his territory, he couldn't change the time flow rate without restriction. In fact, the rate of 1:30 million was actually Holy Jay's limit.</p>

  <p>If he continued to slow the time, then the escaping Time Law would show signs of chaos. The Time Law was originally quite mysterious. If the time flow rates in the two adjacent places were different, then they would form a kind of "time difference." And this time difference contained an unstoppable pressure.</p>

  <p>The more he slowed the time flow rate, the more the pressure of the time difference would increase.</p>

  <p>This door was a supreme primordial weapon and incomparably sturdy, capable of withstanding pressure of an extreme strength, and showed no sign of weakness. But if the door were to begin cracking, then chances were that the entire door would simply collapse.</p>

  <p>The intense time difference pressure was no joke. After the compressed time intersected with normal time, it would produce a terrifying pressure.</p>

  <p>Originally, this was a powerful method used by warriors who cultivated the Time Law.</p>

  <p>Ordinary True Gods were already terrifyingly powerful when they slowed the time flow rate to 1:100, 000.</p>

  <p>But now, Holy Jay had slowed time to 1:30 million. This was considered pure craziness.</p>

  <p>If the pressure were to erupt, it would be enough to destroy the entire interior world.</p>

  <p>"1:30 million..." Tianming murmured to himself, a bit taken aback. "A single day out here and yet, 30 million days will pass by inside the door.</p>

  <p>That is to say 80, 000 years. Can Luo Luo Zheng bear it?"</p>

  <p>Tianming and Luo Luo Zheng were both too young. Neither of them had ever experienced the scale of even "a hundred years" before, let alone a time scale of eighty thousand years.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. Luo Luo Zheng is sound asleep. To him, this is all just a dream.</p>

  <p>He doesn't actually have to live through all these years," said Holy Jay reassuringly.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of years meant nothing to True Gods or Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Certain True Gods had lived for countless ages up until now and had passed through too many eras to even keep track of, so their understanding of time was naturally different.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng, who had only lived for a few decades, were to endure tens of thousands of years in solitude, it would definitely be one of the greatest forms of torture. That was why, directly from the get go, Holy Drew had tried making Luo Luo Zheng fall into a deep sleep.</p>

  <p>The eight-diagram disc continued to swirl around in circles.</p>

  <p>The black flame travelled back and forth, sinking deeper and deeper into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The golden glow of the Sanskrit words on his body grew brighter and brighter.</p>

  <p>A beautiful figure quietly emerged from within Luo Zheng's body, watching him in silence.</p>

  <p>Xun was left inside the door.</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng had returned from the Illusion Battlefield, Xun's attitude had been rather strange toward him.</p>

  <p>She seemed to be worried about something, and she often appeared to be at odds with Luo Luo Zheng. She had even stopped talking to him.</p>

  <p>Right now though, she raised her head and surveyed her surroundings.</p>

  <p>Looking at the dream-like space, she flashed a lonely smile. "This is a good place for me," she said.</p>

  <p>Of course, she understood that inside the door, the time flow rate was different.</p>

  <p>If Holy Drew needed a full day in order to refine Luo Zheng's body, then Luo Luo Zheng would have to lie here for 80, 000 years.</p>

  <p>She had hoped countless times that time would stop, as long as she stayed by Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>No matter how much she wished it, time continued to push her forward step by step, forcing her into an abyss she had no desire to face.</p>

  <p>But now, time had finally come to a full stop, or rather, it was infinitely close to stopping.</p>

  <p>If one day passed in the outside world, she could accompany Luo Luo Zheng for eighty thousand years. If it was two days, it would be one hundred and sixty thousand years. And that was a long time for Xun.</p>

  <p>Looking at the sleeping Luo Luo Zheng, Xun stretched out a thin finger and gently caressed his face. Although the golden Sanskrit words continued to spin, causing his face to look slightly sinister, his closed eyes still showed a sense of serenity, making her feel strangely calm and comfortable.</p>

  <p>Unknowingly, this man had become so powerful!</p>

  <p>Although time in this space moved at an extremely slow speed, slower than anyone could ever imagine, Xun wasn't bored. To the contrary, she treasured the slow passing of every day even more.</p>

  <p>A day's time passed by quickly for Tianming, Holy Jay, Holy Drew, and the nine Genuine Dragons. Xun though, who had managed to stay inside the door, had accompanied Luo Luo Zheng for eighty thousand years.</p>
