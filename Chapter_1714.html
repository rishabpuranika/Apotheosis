  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake continued to tremble as the waves weaved themselves into snake scales that emitted light.</p>

  <p>More and more snake scales appeared, and they soon formed one giant snake with a single horn--the Soaring Snake.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake had a brilliantly red body with two wings, and a single horn on its forehead.</p>

  <p>Legend said that once it shed its horn, it would become a dragon.</p>

  <p>It was also said that there were no dragons in the world, and the first dragon that ever appeared had evolved from a Soaring Snake.</p>

  <p>"Hiss!"</p>

  <p>Tianming struggled, but he couldn't control the Soaring Snake because it had shown up on its own.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake was currently twenty feet long. It spread out its wings and charged towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It wasn't interested in eating Luo Zheng, but rather the powerful weapon he held in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake liked supreme primordial weapons the most, but found supreme chaotic weapons appetizing as well.</p>

  <p>Had the snake been a live Soaring Snake, to devour a supreme chaotic weapon would've been fatal. After all, chaotic energy was deadly for a Soaring Snake.</p>

  <p>However, this Soaring Snake had already fused with the Soaring Snake Sword. It was now a weapon spirit, so it didn't have to worry about its health.</p>

  <p>Despite the Soaring Snake's length, it moved extremely fast.</p>

  <p>Its thin tail swayed slightly in the air as it faced the four streaks of sword light Luo Zheng had launched.</p>

  <p>When the Soaring Snake attacked, Zheng's golden sword light streaks were instantly broken.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake's shadow passed by in front of Luo Zheng and before he could react, he felt that something had touched his hand.</p>

  <p>He looked at his palm, and the Thunder Wind Divine Sword had disappeared.</p>

  <p>His eyes quickly averted to the Soaring Snake, which had his Thunder Wind Divine Sword in its clutches. The Soaring Snake suddenly raised its head and threw the sword into the air.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword circled in the air and fell downward. In the next moment, the Soaring Snake opened its mouth and ate the sword.</p>

  <p>"Hiss!"</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake hissed above the edge of the Heaven Earth Board before it flew back to Tianming in a flash.</p>

  <p>It moved gracefully and unbelievably swift despite its weight. Now, that was the real 'approaching without casting a shadow and leaving without a trace'.</p>

  <p>The snake was truly dangerous. Even the Supreme Lords in the universe couldn't help but look at it with trepidation.</p>

  <p>Naturally, many people began to desire the Soaring Snake Sword after Tianming's display.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the four clans wanted to recruit Tianming in order to consolidate their clans' power and fortune in the future.</p>

  <p>However, the others had different ideas.</p>

  <p>Some people had found that there was a great chance that Tianming's fortune might be related to this sword.</p>

  <p>Such a weapon was definitely a powerful one which surpassed all the weapons in the Spirit Tablet. In fact, it was much more precious than the supreme divine weapons in the universe.</p>

  <p>While the Soaring Snake looked small and ordinary that many warriors at the lower realms couldn't feel its momentum, the Supreme Lords could feel it emit a deterrent force, which they perceived as a mortal threat to them.</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl who sat on the staircase in the palace amidst the thick clouds stretched out two fingers and crossed them.</p>

  <p>She then observed the Soaring Snake through the gap between her fingers.</p>

  <p>"How would this snake appear? This can be considered as breaking the rules, right?"</p>

  <p>The first rule of the Illusion Battlefield was to fight with one's own power.</p>

  <p>However, different warriors used different methods. Some warriors were good at manipulating beasts, some mainly cultivated spirits. But those things were not allowed to be taken into the battlefield. Though it was unfair to some warriors, the rule had already been set up. It meant to be not able to take everyone into consideration.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there were always warriors knowing how to circumvent the rules.</p>

  <p>For example, Lone had succeeded in making his sword slip into the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>It was a bit similar to how she couldn't stop Tianming from taking his Soaring Snake Sword into the battlefield, even if she knew about it.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't have been a big deal if the Soaring Snake stayed in the sword quietly. However, it suddenly showed up and devoured Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the girl wondered if she should intervene or not.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng dumb-foundedly stared at his empty hands with astonishment.</p>

  <p>'How could he suddenly bring out a snake? How did it eat my sword in just one second?' Luo Zheng thought with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>There was a slight squelching sound as the Soaring Snake tried to swallow the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>However, it failed to do so--then it abruptly twisted its body as its wings began to shake.</p>

  <p>While the Soaring Snake writhed about, it quickly opened its mouth and spat the sword out.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword was broken into pieces. The Soaring Snake violently choked out the pieces which punctured the Heaven Earth Board like nails. The snake's face twisted into disgust as it stared hotly at Luo Zheng. Then, it turned into waves and dissipated as it finally returned to Tianming's sword.</p>

  <p>"What... the hell?" Luo Zheng was dumbfounded and did not know what to say.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Tianming just stood there awkwardly with an apologetic look on his face. He knew that the Soaring Snake did so because it despised Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>This Thunder Wind Divine Sword was not a supreme chaotic weapon.</p>

  <p>It was just a first rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had used the chaotic energy to launch the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Soaring Snake had mistaken his sword for a supreme chaotic weapon.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy Luo Zheng had poured into the sword had been consumed after he launched four strikes, so the snake found that something was wrong with the sword as it chewed it.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake liked to devour powerful weapons, but it didn't find first rank divine weapons in the universe to be powerful enough.</p>

  <p>It was why the Soaring Snake had acted like that.</p>

  <p>All the warriors who watched the scene were utterly shocked as well.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry," Tianming apologized sincerely.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and did not say a word. The damaged Thunder Wind Divine Sword wasn't a big deal since they were currently in the Illusion Battlefield, which meant that the sword wasn't actually broken.</p>

  <p>It was just that Luo Zheng didn't have another proper weapon. It looked like he had to make do with the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>However, he was still hesitant.</p>

  <p>"I have a second rank divine weapon. Would you like to use it?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>Tianming seemed to have felt Zheng's embarrassment, so he offered his opponent a cyan-gray sword.</p>

  <p>He had gotten the second rank divine weapon as a reward in the tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Many warriors in the sacred place had been envious of him during that time when he had claimed his reward, because his cultivation was only on the same level as that of a newly-ascended warrior.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until now did they realize that Tianming didn't consider his second rank divine weapon as something rare.</p>

  <p>"Alright," Luo Zheng said as he nodded his head. He then reached out his hand and was ready to take the sword.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Lone stood still on the stone. His eyes flashed as he communicated with his own broken sword.</p>

  <p>This was a great chance for him and his damaged weapon.</p>

  <p>He and his sword knew that Luo Zheng possessed the chaotic energy, but they didn't know where he had gotten it.</p>

  <p>Lone originally wanted to find Luo Zheng and ask him to nourish his broken sword after the end of the Illusion Battlefield. The chaotic energy was highly necessary for the sword to be fixed.</p>

  <p>Thus, he wanted to seize this chance for his sword. "Wait!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Luo Zheng looked up in confusion.</p>

  <p>"This is an important battle. It is unfair for you to use a second rank divine weapon," Lone said with a smile as he raised his sword and threw it towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The board usually had a constraining force around it which prevented warriors from leaving.</p>

  <p>However, the force had suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>The broken sword flew towards Luo Zheng and landed beside him with a metallic clang.</p>

  <p>Although the sword had been damaged, it still emitted a strong sense of tenacity.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that this sword was extraordinary and thought that it might be good for him if he used it.</p>

  <p>The moment the sword was thrust into the board, Tianming's Soaring Snake Sword began to vibrate once again.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake seemed to smell the fragrance of a powerful weapon and wanted to get out from Tianming's sword.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for the Soaring Snake, Tianming wouldn't allow it to happen again.</p>

  <p>He firmly pressed his thumb on the edge of the Soaring Snake Sword's blade.</p>

  <p>The sword's extremely sharp blade glinted under the light.</p>

  <p>Of course, it cut the skin of Tianming's thumb.</p>

  <p>Tianming then used his thumb as a pen and wrote blood runes on the Soaring Snake Sword's blade. His weapon stopped vibrating.</p>

  <p>"No wonder I had to learn the blood seal skill when I got this sword.</p>

  <p>This Soaring Snake is really active and annoying," Tianming murmured.</p>

  <p>He looked up at Luo Zheng once more, a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Had someone else been faced against Luo Zheng, the one might've continued to attack Luo Zheng and win the battle after the Soaring Snake broke Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming wouldn't do such a thing even if he fought an ordinary warrior, not to mention that Luo Zheng was the one who stood in front of him right now.</p>
