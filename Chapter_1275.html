<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yudie's fists suddenly became clenched when she heard Saul's indifferent words.</p>

  <p>An impossibly large number of Life and Death Realm creatures had surrounded Zheng and were attacking him. The worst part was that every single one of these creatures was proficient in all sorts of Law Power.</p>

  <p>This was perhaps the biggest challenge for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Aura put her hands over her chest and closed her eyes. She knew that she could not change or stop anything now and could only silently pray in her heart.</p>

  <p>As for Margaret, she didn't care about rules and took a step forward, raising her hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Saul asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I am going to break the True Path!" Margaret couldn't be bothered to reason with others. She did not have Yudie's rationality and cared only about Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>However, before she could make her move, Saul piped up, "Your Sky Purple Body is indeed powerful, but you will not be able to activate the space nodes in here."</p>

  <p>Margaret was totally unwilling to listen to this guy. He was kind of a jerk. With a slight movement of her finger, she tried to communicate with the huge swords in the Purple Power World. Her hands circled the area a few times, but there was no response from her surroundings, nor were there any fluctuations. It was just as Saul had said; she could not communicate with the Purple Power World from this place at all. It was as if the place was magically shielded.</p>

  <p>She was at a loss for what to do now. Seeing Zheng constantly struggling in the midst of so many kinds of Law Powers, she was really worried and scared.</p>

  <p>No longer able to bear it, she was about to step forward and jump onto the True Path.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Yudie shouted coldly and grabbed onto Margaret.</p>

  <p>If Margaret had jumped onto the True Path before Zheng, she wouldn't have been in too much danger since the challenge would have been at lower level. But now, those warriors who had been conjured up by the True Path were all at the Life and Death Realm. How could she hope to fight against them?</p>

  <p>"But Zheng..." Margaret said with a face full of worry.</p>

  <p>To be frank, Margaret was indeed smarter than Yudie in certain aspects, such as speculating on Zheng's thoughts. Her EQ was also higher than Yudie's, but in the field of cultivation, she was far from Yudie as she could be. Yudie knew that Margaret would be simply courting death if she jumped onto the True Path now.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, since Margaret's strength was far inferior to Yudie's, no matter how hard she struggled, she could not escape Yudie's control.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Aura chimed in calmly, "Don't worry."</p>

  <p>Margaret looked at Aura and snorted, "You're not worried about Zheng's life at all, are you?"</p>

  <p>"It's not like that." Aura shook her head. "I believe in Zheng. I know that he has the strength to fight back and win!"</p>

  <p>Yudie also nodded. "Zheng's limits and powers are far more than what they seem. Don't listen to this idiot." With that, she pointed at Saul.</p>

  <p>The three women did not have a good impression of Saul. However, it was obvious that the guy did not care about that at all. He was busy watching Zheng's every move as indifferently as if he didn't care about his life at all.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The warriors had been building up their Law Powers and attacked Zheng altogether. But the moment the various kinds of Law Powers struck Zheng, intense rays of light burst out.</p>

  <p>The three women's hands clenched together, their faces full of nervousness and mouths open in shock.</p>

  <p>After the light faded away, Zheng was still standing there, his body completely intact. However, his clothes had been destroyed by the energy.</p>

  <p>"What? This guy seems to have transferred the power that hit him somewhere else." Saul's face once again revealed an expression of surprise.</p>

  <p>As for Margaret and Aura, they both let out a sigh of relief with ecstatic smiles on their faces. They did not care about the process, nor did they want to know how Zheng had survived the attack. What they cared about was that Zheng seemed all right and would live to fight another day.</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes were also filled with shock. "How the hell did he do that?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"For the time being, even I can't tell. He seems to have fused with some kind of will. A will usually belongs to some treasure, and he might have transferred the power to that treasure," Saul tried to explain. Even he was unable to figure out that Zheng had fused with the will of the entire great world. He had just transferred the power he had received to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. The attacks from the mighty warriors were simply unable to break the mountain.</p>

  <p>Relying on this means, Zheng once again rushed forward. Since he knew that they could not hurt him, he let those warriors use all sorts of methods, but he himself did not stop at all.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he felt the warriors falling behind and the road ahead gradually brightening up. Moreover, he saw that Saul and the three women were standing right in front of him.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had set foot on the True Path, these four people had been right behind him. However, he hadn't thought that the end of the road would actually be the beginning of it, which surprised him a bit.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng jumped up and out of the True Path. He smiled at Saul and asked,</p>

  <p>"Did I pass the test?"</p>

  <p>"You passed the first stage," Saul answered in his usual indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>"What about the token?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Saul pointed behind Zheng. The latter turned his head around, and saw that the Dark and Light energies on the fields were slowly drifting.</p>

  <p>Eventually, they congealed. At the same time, the entire fields disappeared, and a token slowly descended from the sky.</p>

  <p>The three women also raised their heads and looked at it. Yudie said cheerfully, "It's a token of water."</p>

  <p>A token carved with the word "water" slowly floated down and dropped into Zheng's outstretched hand. He looked at it and heard Saul say, "With that token in your possession, you will be able to enter the library and read all the books within it."</p>

  <p>"The library!" Zheng's eyebrows shot up.</p>

  <p>Nothing inside this fairy palace was insignificant. But for Zheng at his current level of cultivation, other parts of the palace might not be that important, but the library was definitely an indispensable item.</p>

  <p>"You are much stronger than I have imagined. Even a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm wouldn't have survived under the siege of so many Life and Death Realm warriors. They were from the Sacred Race.</p>

  <p>However, you seem to have transferred the attacks you received onto some treasure. If you have confidence in that treasure, you can also start challenging the second stage of the True Path now," Saul encouraged.</p>

  <p>Saul thought that Zheng possessed some kind of treasure, but actually such a thing did not exist. Of course, he could also view the entire great world as Zheng's treasure.</p>

  <p>The capacity of a great world was terrifying. Even though some of the strongest warriors of the universe could destroy every single creature of the Central Region, it was impossible for them to destroy an entire great world.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng couldn't let the great world suffer from too many strong attacks. Last time, in order to resist the attack of the black eye, Zheng had caused almost every single normal mountain in the great world to be destroyed. This time, he had transferred the attacks he had received to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Sure. I'd like to," Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Saul nodded his head. The fog below dispersed and the True Path was once again opened up in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, the second stage is even more difficult than the first one, so you should be careful," Saul told him. "But since you can transfer the attacks you receive, so as long as your treasure can bear those attacks, there shouldn't be too much danger for you."</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng once again rushed onto the True Path without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Now, Margaret turned her head and smiled at Aura. "Alright, you can turn around now."</p>

  <p>Only then did Aura turn around and look at the True Path. Her face was still filled with shyness and her cheeks were crimson. Zheng's clothes were gone, so she had turned her head away shyly. As for Yudie and Margaret, they were naturally not shy. After all, they had already had sex with him.</p>

  <p>The second stage of the test took an hour, and the strength of the Sacred Race warriors also rose several notches level. Although they still did not use any cultivation methods, the warriors created by the Dark and Light energies were all at the Soul Sea Realm. Even the Law Powers they had grasped had risen to the third or fourth layer.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, these guys did not know how to unleash domains. Once again, Zheng merely transferred the attacks from these warriors to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain and the mountain simply absorbed all the attacks.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was focused on dashing forward on the True Path instead of fighting, and didn't have the time to investigate the condition of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Even though it was impervious to swords and spears and such weapons, there was a limit to the amount of strength it could endure. Just how terrifying was the power contained within the continuous attacks of dozens of powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm? Could it withstand that?</p>

  <p>In reality, the majority of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was located at the bottom of the sea. There was already a shallow crack in it, and that crack was constantly expanding.</p>

  <p>"Done!" Zheng had passed the second stage of the True Path. However, it was only now that he saw Aura's face blushing, and she suddenly turned around. He chuckled as he took out a set of clothes from his space ring and put them on.</p>

  <p>Following the descent of the vast fog, another token appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>This time, it was a token of mountain.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of this token?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>When Saul saw that Zheng had obtained this token, a trace of happiness appeared on his face. "With this token, you can carry the fairy palace around with you!"</p>
