<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>How could the soul of this guy withstand the powerful suppression? This was impossible! Eddie assumed that Luo Zheng had a magic treasure that could reinforce his soul or something else that enabled him to be immune to such kind of damage!</p>

  <p>He cast a meaningful look at Luo Zheng and hid his killing Mu Ning deep inside. He turned around and walked toward his son.</p>

  <p>Eden's hair was disheveled, and his eyes were dull. He looked dejected as if he had aged ten years in an instant. He had lost all his glow and looked pale, like a dead person.</p>

  <p>Eddie grabbed Eden's hand and reached out with his other hand for the saber. The Nameless Saber swirled back into his hand. In a flash, he returned to the high platform where he had been seated earlier.</p>

  <p>The three fat masters from the World Commercial Alliance exchanged glances. Shock registered on Dillon's chubby face. He was transfixed like a frozen statue.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had withstood Eddie's suppression! He wondered how powerful Zheng's soul was.</p>

  <p>Of course, they didn't know that Zheng's soul had already entered the Fighting Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>Even the owl-beast's evil spirit had been unable to destroy Zheng's soul. How could Eddie possibly hurt Zheng's soul?</p>

  <p>From a certain perspective, so far, Zheng's soul, which had entered the Fighting Soul Realm was the most powerful weapon in his arsenal.</p>

  <p>To most warriors, what happened between Luo Zheng and Eddie was only a small clash that lasted less than a minute. However, the situation had been the most dangerous one. Many warriors in the audience failed to see that, but a few cultivators were able to sense the tension.</p>

  <p>However, even though they knew something was happening between the two, the warriors couldn't tell what it really was. The soul realm was a level that was beyond their reach, and it was difficult for them to understand how it worked.</p>

  <p>As for Lady Poison-blood of Bloodwood Cliff, Raven of the Black Mountain Sect, the Elderly Luna of the Mysterious Luna Hall, and a few others, they were all as shocked as the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance!</p>

  <p>If it were them who had been standing in front of Eddie, and if they had been facing the suppression coming from Eddie's soul, their souls would have been injured, and they would have spat a lot of blood. But it was strange that Luo Zheng just stood there unharmed as if nothing had happened. This didn't make any sense.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie gently turned her head and picked up the golden phoenix hairpin from the ground. She pulled her pitch-black hair to the back and locked it with her index finger before she used the hairpin to hold her hair in place.</p>

  <p>Then she walked over to Zheng's side and said softly, "Let's go to the platform." After she finished speaking, cold air surrounded her. She leaped into the air. The long feathers of the ice phoenix fluttered behind her, and within a split second, she landed on the high platform!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained silent. At least, he was sure that he had achieved his goal.</p>

  <p>Even though it was not what he had intended, Luo Zheng had successfully angered Eddie!</p>

  <p>Eddie had brought two disciples to participate in the Martial Arts Contest this year. One was his son, Eden, while the other was Marilyn.</p>

  <p>If Eddie wanted to win in the Martial Arts Competition, he could only rely on Marilyn Si!</p>

  <p>Marilyn Si was at the medium-stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, and she was stronger than Eden. She also had the Purple Power Body, like Yan did.</p>

  <p>This woman had followed Eddie for a few decades, so she must have learned a lot from him. Luo Zheng had no idea how talented she was, or what her real strength was.</p>

  <p>But no matter how strong she was, she must die. Luo Zheng wouldn't let her go like he did to Eden.</p>

  <p>After getting to the high platform, Ning Yudie returned to the large chair prepared for her. She sat there, her mind still a mess, and her eyes wandering around. Occasionally, she would cast secret glances at Luo Zheng, like a little girl, but soon, she would shift her gaze and look at the sky aimlessly.</p>

  <p>Of course, no one noticed her secret movements, because she once again cast layers of icy mist to encase herself.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xiao came to the center of the arena and announced that the competition would be suspended.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had broken the enchanted barrier on the battle arena, they needed to fix it. However, the runes that had been hidden under the enchanted barrier had exploded and needed to be repaired before the next battle could begin.</p>

  <p>It was clear that repairing these runes would take time. After all, the World Commercial Alliance had arranged these runes many years ago and they had put many efforts into building them! If they wanted to repair these runes, they would need to send for the runic experts who had made them.</p>

  <p>When the warriors in the grandstand heard the news that the competition would be suspended, they were annoyed and began to curse.</p>

  <p>"Damn! It cost me a supreme life vitality crystal to get in here. Why the hell would you suddenly suspend the battle?"</p>

  <p>"Is this what the World Commercial Alliance is like? What a good reputation! My good mood is spoiled!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it just an enchanted barrier? Why should you bother? Hurry up, go on fighting!"</p>

  <p>These warriors didn't care about the enchantment barrier being broken.</p>

  <p>They only wanted to watch the fierce battle and bet on the game!</p>

  <p>In fact, the World Commercial Alliance suspended the competition for the safety of the warriors in the grandstand. In a fight between Internal Elixir Realm masters, without the protection of the enchanted barrier, those warriors outside the arena would be easily hurt by the aftermath of the strikes.</p>
