</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not expect to see golden Sanskrit words in the Money Alley of all places.</p>

  <p>What was more shocking was that they were actual, real Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was certain since there was no way to fake the genuine auras they exuded.</p>

  <p>The stall owner was a sleeping old man in plain clothes. He was a low-rank True God and seemed completely indifferent to his surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Can the Sanskrit words be sold?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask? Sanskrit words are normal commodities here in the divine land. Of course they can be traded," Master Evil said in response.</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>It didn't really sit right with Luo Luo Zheng. To him, every single Sanskrit word was filled with extremely rich meaning. If he could decipher just one word, then he was bound to benefit greatly from it.</p>

  <p>The old man's stall was densely packed with over a hundred brocade boxes, so did that mean there were over a hundred Sanskrit words here?</p>

  <p>"Look at the Sanskrit word in your hand. This is the very first word Holy Waldo discovered years ago and its meaning has long been comprehended by hundreds of people. It has been widely spread all throughout the divine land. What's so great about it?" Master Evil said, trying to convince Luo Luo Zheng of the lightness of the matter. "The other words in this stall have most probably already been seen by so many people.</p>

  <p>They're not that special."</p>

  <p>The discovery of the first golden Sanskrit word had left a profound impact on the divine land, causing a frenzy of divine citizens to search for other Sanskrit words all over the land. Each discovered word was then copied countless times.</p>

  <p>This led to the widespread circulation of the early discovered Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>That first batch spanned roughly around 90 words that many talented individuals translated and deciphered.</p>

  <p>These Sanskrit words were by no means rare, and since this old man dared sell them, he must have obtained new understandings and explanations for these words.</p>

  <p>"If it's a new Sanskrit word, never seen before yet readable, then that word's value would be extremely terrifying. That type of Sanskrit word would greatly alarm the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands. That kind of precious Sanskrit word could never be sold here," Master Evil added.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean the value would be extremely terrifying?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, his heart skipping a beat by Master Evil's words.</p>

  <p>Back in the Immortal Mansion, Luo Nian had managed to read the Sanskrit words in the library. Luo Luo Zheng hadn't yet realized the value of these words, and Immortal Book had told him that he'd only understand once he reached the divine land. It was true. He only realized what Immortal Book meant now that he was here, in front of a stall selling Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"All the Holy Beings have their own methods in digging out the Sanskrit words, but only around 20% have been interpreted. I've been imprisoned for seven divine eras so that may have changed. Some Sanskrit words may have been interpreted by now; I can't be too sure. All I know is that those wealthy clans are very protective of the Sanskrit words they've interpreted. A divine citizen once managed to interpret three Sanskrit words, which led to fighting among six of the wealthy clans. The price they offered for those words was something that even top-rank True Gods would yearn for," Master Evil explained.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is..." Luo Luo Zheng nodded silently.</p>

  <p>He hadn't thought too much of it when Luo Nian displayed such a talent, but it seemed that a skill like that was of the utmost importance here in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The old man noticed Luo Luo Zheng standing in front of his stall, deep in thought and not moving at all. He opened his previously half-lidded eyes and glanced at the young man indifferently. "Hey, kid! You want some Sanskrit words? I've put my own hard work and notes in them. They're worth looking at, I assure you. Only ten divine might coins for a word."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled before shaking his head. "No thank you!" Despite his interest, these Sanskrit words were of little use to him right now.</p>

  <p>Moreover, not every word was valuable. Just like the Grand Weapon Refining Method, the kind of word he wanted was the type that had never been passed around in the divine land, which meant it would be difficult to buy no matter how much money one was willing to offer.</p>

  <p>The old man glared at Luo Luo Zheng before going back to sleep.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then decided to look through the stalls one by one and was greatly amused by the number of strange things he saw.</p>

  <p id="top_16">For example, one stall was selling sparkling Godly Tiles that looked like translucent gems and emitted rays of gentle light. The blue Godly Tile contained a kind of powerful, icy power while the red held some kind of strange, flickering flame. The black Godly Tile was intriguing since it contained some kind of unique law.</p>

  <p>To divine citizens, a Godly Tile was an opportunity to prove the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Some wealthy proving godly warriors who were desperate to prove the Divine Dao would often choose to buy a Godly Tile to place in their inner world. Such a method was fast and could give a warrior eternal life. However, it wasn't the kind of route many chose unless absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>The main reason was that these Godly Tiles were brought over from other True Gods. If placed in another warrior's inner world, the foreign Godly Tile would be excluded and rejected which meant they could neither be enhanced nor have their cultivation level raised. Despite the cheap pricing of the Godly Tiles, Luo Luo Zheng simply walked away from the stall.</p>

  <p>After wandering around, Luo Luo Zheng finally managed to find what he actually needed? a space ring. The stall owner, seeing Luo Zheng's identity, raised the price to ten divine might coins. Thankfully, Master Evil was there to tell him that the price being offered was too high, so Luo Luo Zheng was able to bargain with the stall owner and reduce the ten divine might coins down to five.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to spend too much since the space ring was only going to be used as temporary storage.</p>

  <p>As he picked the space ring up, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt his elixir field tremble.</p>

  <p>The inner world within his elixir field seemed to have undergone a slight change as if it was telling Luo Luo Zheng that it was feeling extremely hungry.</p>

  <p>A world, as confirmed by Luo Luo Zheng long ago, had its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>However, this consciousness did not come from the owner. For example, the consciousness of the Evolutionary Universe was not from his father, Luo Xiao, but from the collated individual consciousness of each creature that lived and died within it.</p>

  <p>He hadn't felt his inner world's consciousness once since he stepped into the Soul Sea Realm. This was the very first time he did so.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned, not quite understanding why such a thought was transmitted from his elixir field.</p>

  <p>However, before he could think about it any further, the consciousness reminded Luo Luo Zheng to turn his head. He immediately conceded and found himself face to face with another stall. The owner was a young girl who wore an orange dress. She was very pretty, and looked around sixteen to seventeen years old. Luo Luo Zheng knew though that it was impossible to judge one's age just by their appearance.</p>

  <p>His gaze shifted from the owner to an item she was selling.</p>

  <p>A number of strange things lined the stall, most of which Luo Luo Zheng did not even recognize.</p>

  <p>However, one object caught his eye. It was at the edge of the stall: an unremarkable piece of mud, covered in dust.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled sweetly at Luo Luo Zheng. "Is there anything you wish to buy?"</p>

  <p>"What did you take a fancy to?" Master Evil also asked. There didn't seem to be anything of value in this stall but he could clearly feel the tremble in Luo Zheng's soul. Whatever it was that he saw seemed to be extremely important.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not answer either of them and simply continued to stare at that lump of brown mud.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the consciousness that had come out from his elixir field suddenly wrestled Luo Zheng's own consciousness and took control of his body.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, the young man found himself moving towards that piece of mud.</p>

  <p>This only lasted for a moment. A glint flashed across Luo Zheng's eyes as he immediately suppressed his inner world's consciousness, halting his footsteps. However, he still stared at that lump of mud.</p>
