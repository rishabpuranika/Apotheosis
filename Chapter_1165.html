  <p>
</p>

  <p>War Emperor York did not want to argue with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was a king and Luo Luo Zheng was merely a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>It undermined his dignity to argue with the young man. He knew that he could not kill Luo Luo Zheng with his own strength alone. Since the boy had stolen the little monster's power, he could transfer his power to other things as he pleased.</p>

  <p>However, this was not something that didn't have a solution. Luo Luo Zheng was on his territory now. War Emperor York could sever his connection with the great world easily. In his domain, he was the one who made the rules.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was only a sitting duck.</p>

  <p>Turner frowned. He wanted to stop them before the situation got worse, but he hesitated to do so. He was calm and fair, but it looked like Tianxing was in the wrong here.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, War Emperor York drew himself closer to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, before he could even touch Luo Luo Zheng, a figure appeared in front of the young man. The newcomer wasn't Lord Randy, but Fiona.</p>

  <p>She stood in front of Luo Luo Zheng with a solemn expression, the jade bracelet around her arm quivering.</p>

  <p>When Fiona rushed over to Luo Luo Zheng, Callan too came to stand before Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Back off!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York roared. He was trying to hold in his temper knowing that Fiona was the princess of the Wind Divine Kingdom and Callan its prince. If they had been any other divine-level talents, regardless of which divine kingdom they came from, he would have killed them both then and there!</p>

  <p>"Callan! Fiona! What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>When War King Wind saw Callan and Fiona come to stand before Luo Luo Zheng, he immediately became anxious. He did not know why his kids were getting involved when War Emperor York was in the midst of his infamous fury.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing injured Fredric. He stood up for us. War Emperor York, instead of blaming Tianxing, you should have educated your son!" Fiona was a naive and romantic woman, but that didn't mean she was timid. On the contrary, it was because she was naive that she had an earnest attitude.</p>

  <p>She considered Fredric to be in the wrong in this matter, which was why she spoke in such a righteous and reasonable manner in front of War Emperor York. But he didn't want to reason with her.</p>

  <p>He had always wanted to get rid of Luo Luo Zheng as soon as possible, and Fredric was his best excuse!</p>

  <p>"Humph!" A force swept over Fiona and Callan with a flick of War Emperor York's hand. He wished to push them aside, but just as his power was about to reach them, War King Wind came to stand beside Fiona. In his hands appeared a brown fire shield.</p>

  <p>When the fire shield and War Emperor York's invisible power crashed into each other, an intense flame burst out and the shield destroyed War Emperor York's force.</p>

  <p>"Lucien, at least listen to the kids first before you get angry," War King Wind said grimly. He understood what had happened from what Fiona said. Fiona never lied. Tianxing had helped out his children and that was when he injured Fredric. That was to say, Fredric had taken advantage of his children.</p>

  <p>"Wind!" War Emperor York was filled with rage. The last time he tried to kill Luo Luo Zheng, Turner had stopped him. This time, War King Wind was holding him back. Why was Luo Luo Zheng so fortunate?</p>

  <p>Seeing that War King Wind had stepped forward, Turner walked up to them. "Wind is right," he said to War Emperor York. "If there's a problem among the kids, let them make it clear."</p>

  <p>Even though Turner was polite, he stood by War King Wind's side.</p>

  <p>Clearly, he was trying to stop War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>With these two people urging him, War Emperor York felt somewhat helpless. He could only wait and see how the situation unfolded.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, War King Wind turned to Fiona and said, "Fiona, tell us what happened."</p>

  <p>Fiona nodded and told him everything that had occurred before.</p>

  <p>War King Wind frowned as he heard that Fredric had taken life vitality crystals from Callan with a trick. On the other hand, War Emperor York was embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that a dignified divine kingdom crown prince would do this sort of thing for nine thousand supreme life vitality crystals? It was truly shameful. Obviously, he had done it because he thought Callan was too honest. It was an act of a bully.</p>

  <p>Although War King Wind had been focusing on Fiona all the time, Callan was, after all, the crown prince of the Wind Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>What Fredric had done to him was outrageous.</p>

  <p>After hearing what Fiona said, War King Wind turned to War Emperor York. "Lucien, it sounds like everything happened because of Fredric.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng injured him, but that was something he brought upon himself. Don't you agree?"</p>

  <p>Turner laughed as well. "I think so too. Lucien, your son is a real piece of work. He could have just returned the life vitality crystals after being exposed. But he didn't do so. Isn't it a little..." It was on the tip of his tongue that Fredric was foolish and irresponsible, but he managed to stop himself from spilling out the words.</p>

  <p>"But my son was injured for nothing! The Heart Condensation Necklace and the Heavenly Thunder Halberd are priceless treasures. Someone must pay the price for them!" The reality that Fredric couldn't manage to harm Luo Luo Zheng even after using the Heavenly Thunder Halberd left War Emperor York deeply dejected.</p>

  <p>Turner did not respond to this accusation, but War King Wind's face darkened. "Price? Lucien, all these years you've been getting more and more unreasonable! Your son has always bullied my son. Shouldn't he pay the price as well? I let it go, but I can't believe you're trying to twist the facts here. Do you actually think that York Divine Kingdom is above all the others?"</p>

  <p>War King Wind was not as good-tempered as Turner. Besides, Fiona was the apple of his eye. When she had spoken earlier, he had been quick to figure out that his daughter had been mistreated and that Tianxing had stood up for her. Even in his presence, Lucien was biased against Fiona. It pissed him off.</p>

  <p>"Wind! You..." War Emperor York was too furious to finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>War King Wind snorted dismissively, not bothering to pay attention to Lucien. If it weren't for the fact that the four divine kingdoms had been living harmoniously with each other for so many years, he would have acted out on the spot.</p>

  <p>The development of the York Divine Kingdom in the recent years had indeed been impressive, but that was because of the martial artists of the younger generation. The Soul Sea Realm warriors of the various divine kingdoms had hardly seen any growth. If things got ugly, Lucien would not emerge the victor against War King Wind or Turner.</p>

  <p>War King Wind turned to Luo Luo Zheng and smiled. "Tianxing, you did a good job. As long as I am here, no one will dare touch you. Otherwise, be sure that they will be courting death!"</p>

  <p>The words were heartless and cold.</p>

  <p>A smile crept across Luo Zheng's mouth as he nodded. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>"You're welcome. I should thank you on behalf of Fiona." War King Wind sized Luo Luo Zheng up. The more he looked him over, the more satisfied he was.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not want to extend his stay any longer. "I have to go and mine.</p>

  <p>Please excuse me," he said to Turner and War King Wind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been holding onto the Black Star pickax, which had previously looked too ordinary from afar. It was just like a black hammer. However, when Luo Luo Zheng turned around, the gazes of the Soul Sea Realm warriors latched on to the pickax in his hand. Lucien, Turner, War King Wind, and Scott all had puzzled expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>The pickax in Luo Zheng's hand seemed a bit familiar to them.</p>

  <p>In fact, these leaders had studied the Black Star pickax numerous times and tried to extract it, so they all had deep impressions of it in their minds.</p>

  <p>They had assumed that nobody could retrieve the Black Star pickax.</p>

  <p>Who could do so, if they, the strongest Soul Sea Realm warriors, couldn't? So even though the pickax in Luo Zheng's hand looked familiar to them, they didn't immediately recognize it. Not in a hundred years would they have imagined that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to get the Black Star pickax.</p>

  <p>Lucien stared at the pickax gloomily. His eyes glistened as they landed on the three ten-star divine textures on its head. 'Black Star pickax? In Luo Zheng's hands?</p>

  <p>What is going on?'</p>

  <p>The other Soul Sea Realm warriors all wondered simultaneously.</p>
