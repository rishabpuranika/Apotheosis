  <p>
</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance had hosted the Martial Arts Contest once every decade for hundreds of years. At that rate, it had organized the contest several dozen times.</p>

  <p>After arranging so many contests, it had accumulated much experience.</p>

  <p>For example, it had settled the problem of the enchanted barrier in the arena.</p>

  <p>Seventy years ago, at a contest, two martial artists fought each other in the finals. They burned their blood essence to unleash their strongest power, ultimately breaking the enchanted barrier and affecting the audience in the stands. Over a thousand martial artists were injured, and hundreds died.</p>

  <p>The alliance drew a lesson from the bitter experience and paid more attention to the facilities during the contest.</p>

  <p>The arena used the most reliable material. A type of extremely strong ironwood heart was woven into silk. The hardest basalt was ground into powder and then mixed with the ironwood heart to make bricks. These bricks were paved one by one and covered by a layer of steel plate. The plate was not an ordinary object. It was also forged by a weapon refiner and contained heavenly essence. In a sense, it could be treated as a mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>The light curtain of the enchanted barrier was even more carefully designed. The top runic experts in the Central Region drew over 400 runes to form six enchanted barriers. These six enchanted barriers were only a finger-width distance from each other. With the power of the runes, a dispersive effect was created within these gaps to combine the six enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>This was the protection effort of the World Commercial Alliance!</p>

  <p>In the following seventy years, the light curtain of the enchanted barrier had never been broken.</p>

  <p>Even earlier, when Luo Zheng's sword spirit, Lily, had slammed the Netherworld Yaksha on the barrier with her sword, causing the barrier to show signs of instability, Xiao's expression did not change at all. Even if one barrier was broken, there were still five barriers behind it!</p>

  <p>However, this thought only lasted for less than thirty seconds. After Luo Luo Zheng and Lily switched positions, with a punch, the enchanted barrier shattered.</p>

  <p>The moment the enchanted barrier broke, several explosions were heard in the surrounding area. Smoke and dust floated into the air. The runes that were hidden underneath the ground around the arena couldn't withstand the pressure. At this time, they exploded as well.</p>

  <p>How powerful was Luo Zheng's body?</p>

  <p>It was not challenging for any of the elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm to break the barrier.</p>

  <p>However, Hobbes, who was famous for his explosive power, could not shatter the barrier with the strength of his physical body. It was even more impossible for Ning Yudie, Lady Poison-blood, and Raven. Eddie, however, might have been capable of breaking the barrier.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Luo Luo Zheng was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm. Moreover, he did not direct his power at the barrier, but at the Yaksha's body. The force Luo Luo Zheng used rippled through the Yaksha's body before striking the barrier.</p>

  <p>Although the impact would have reduced upon hitting the Yaksha, it was still strong enough to destroy the barrier.</p>

  <p>Could it be said that Luo Luo Zheng had inherent divine strength? But this wouldn't explain the strength of Luo Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>What was more surprising was that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't summoned all the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng was quite wealthy. In the vast Oracle City, there were many mysterious weapons. Before the Martial Arts Contest, Luo Luo Zheng had collected some mysterious weapons and refined them into heavenly essence. After consuming the essence, he had been able to light up eight hundred dragon scales in one go.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if Luo Luo Zheng wanted to use the dragon scales, he could summon the power of over a thousand dragon scales. However, his body wouldn't be able to bear the tremendous power.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng unleashed all of the power of the dragon scales, his body would probably collapse and suffer irreparable damage.</p>

  <p>However, the power of five hundred dragon scales was already very terrifying.</p>

  <p>The Yaksha rolled out of the arena, but it quickly stood. After all, it could not be killed so quickly with just physical injuries.</p>

  <p>After taking such a heavy blow from Luo Luo Zheng, the Yaksha had grown even larger. Now, it was 30 feet tall!</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>The Yaksha stood and once again charged toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not care about how big the Yaksha had grown. After repeated collisions and blows, the primordial energy in his body flowed continually.</p>

  <p>The energy was now being stored in his limbs and bones.</p>

  <p>In the center of the arena, Eden was hindered by Lily's sword dance, making it hard for him to escape. However, he would occasionally glance at Luo Luo Zheng with a smile on his face. 'Go on, ' he thought. 'The more attacks the Yaksha receives, the bigger its size, and the stronger it will become!'</p>

  <p>Surely, Luo Luo Zheng had noticed the change in the Yaksha. At this moment, the Yaksha was already 30 feet tall. It looked like a colossal monster. Even the explosive power of five hundred dragon scales could not defeat such a huge creature.</p>

  <p>"It's about time!"</p>

  <p>As the Yaksha swung its tail, Luo Luo Zheng utilized the Wind Law. With a flutter of his wind, he dodged the attack and approached the Yaksha's head. The iron sword in his hand instantly collapsed, and the violent power of lightning spontaneously erupted along the iron sword.</p>

  <p>Lightning could ward off evil.</p>

  <p>Almost all ghosts were afraid of the power of lightning.</p>

  <p>Back on Cloud Road, Tianming's Extreme Thunder Sword Intent was extremely effective against the impenetrable Dark Devil Phantom.</p>

  <p>"Putzi ?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng released the first layer of the Thunder Law, Annihilation. The enormous Yaksha was like a block of ice in summer. A large hole immediately appeared in its stomach as Luo Zheng's sword pierced it.</p>

  <p>"The fourth law! This boy has comprehended the power of four laws!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not surprised. After all, he is talented! Even if a fifth power of law were to appear in his body, I wouldn't be astonished!"</p>

  <p>"The power of four laws has appeared on the same person at the same time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it's the full power. What's wrong with this era? How would such a monster be born?"</p>

  <p>"If Eden is a divine-level talent, then what level of talent is Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng display the power of Thunder Law, many of the cultivators were speechless. They didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't have time to listen to the cultivators' nonsense. Instead of stopping after his first blow, Luo Luo Zheng stabbed the Yaksha several times in quick succession!</p>

  <p>The surging lightning and the powerful flicking of the sword mixed. The Yaksha that was originally invulnerable to swords and spears had met its nemesis. Large holes began appearing on its body.</p>

  <p>Finally, with a howl, the Yaksha's body crumbled.</p>

  <p>A scarlet rune appeared under the Yaksha's feet. Its broken body began to fall toward the rune. The giant head was still glaring at Luo Luo Zheng as it snuck into the rune.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng intended to cut off the Yaksha's head. However, when he thrust his sword at the rune, his sword bounced back!</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed. He did not expect that the small rune would be able to block his sword!</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng did not know was that the rune was a symbol that was connected to the Netherworld River. Even the strongest powerhouse in this boundless universe would not be able to destroy it, as it involved the most fundamental thing in the world.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't keep the Yaksha, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to give up and turn back to Eden.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you want me to die?" Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You!" Eden was currently in a precarious state. He was running around to avoid Lily, whose sword dance was an interlocking move. Since he had been caught by it, Eden would die for sure. He had no time to retort as he was busy dealing with Lily.</p>

  <p>"You have a sacred weapon, a powerful father, and divine-level talent. In a word, you have all the conditions to comprehend Law Power, to be exact, two kinds of Law Powers." Luo Luo Zheng smiled and continued, "In the end, however, you are weak in front of me! You even summoned a helper from the netherworld to defeat me. Alas!"</p>

  <p>"You also summoned this woman?" Eden retorted while dodging Lily's attack.</p>

  <p>"This woman? She is not a woman. She is only my sword spirit. I created her while I was cultivating. You know, she's completely different from the underworld ghost that you summoned!" Luo Luo Zheng continued to speak with a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>Eden's face flushed red, but he was helpless. He wanted to save the situation, so he resorted to dangerous moves, but he was still unable to get rid of Lily.</p>

  <p>"You are at the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm, but I am only at the Illuminating Soul Realm. Still, I can defeat you so easily. Are you sure that you have divine-level talent, not earth level? In my opinion, your talent doesn't deserve to be ranked." Luo Luo Zheng did not physically attack Eden. Instead, he provoked Eden with his words.</p>

  <p>In the Martial Arts Contest, Luo Luo Zheng intended to kill only one person, and that was Marilyn.</p>

  <p>Now, if Luo Luo Zheng used his full strength, for example, if he were to unleash the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death, he would be able to kill Eden.</p>

  <p>However, Eden wasn't his target. If he killed Eden, it was likely that his plan would be ruined!</p>

  <p>However, although Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to kill Eden, that didn't mean he would be merciful. The son of his enemy was also his enemy. Moreover, Eden had wanted to kill Luo Luo Zheng. Now, Luo Luo Zheng was trying to destroy Eden's dedication to martial arts.</p>

  <p>"Judging from your appearance, you should be at least thirty, right? You have only reached the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm at the age of thirty. What's worse, you are unable to defeat an Illuminating Soul Realm cultivator..."</p>

  <p>Under pressure by Luo Zheng's constant taunting, Eden suddenly shouted and rushed toward Luo Luo Zheng, ignoring Lily's sword dance.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>How could Lily give Eden the chance to hurt Luo Luo Zheng? The greatsword struck Eden's body, and Eden rolled across the arena toward Luo Luo Zheng, his hair in disarray, and the Nameless Saber in his hand falling to the side.</p>

  <p>"A guy like you wants to propose to Tia? Do you think you're qualified?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he glared at Eden.</p>

  <p>"Enough!"</p>

  <p>The veins on Eddie's forehead popped out as he abruptly stood and shouted.</p>

  <p>As a top expert of the Central Region, he knew what Luo Luo Zheng was trying to do!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wanted to destroy Eden's dedication to martial arts!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gazed at Eddie, sighed, and said, "Too late!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Eden, who was lying on the ground, felt a cracking sound coming from his heart. Although he didn't suffer too much, he suddenly felt an ache in his heart.</p>
