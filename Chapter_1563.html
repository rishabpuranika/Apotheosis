<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The black venom was extremely corrosive! It aggressively disintegrated anything it touched.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the orange protective light shining over Harley was completely corroded.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the frightened crowd heard an intense and ravenous roar coming from below!</p>

  <p>Although warriors would not really die after being killed in the Illusion Battlefield, the pain they experienced was still real. Being slowly disintegrated and eaten by this venom until death set in, was not going to be a pleasant experience. Quite the opposite, as the pain was excruciating.</p>

  <p>When the warriors heard this beastly voice coming from the deep, their hearts trembled slightly, and they nervously looked for a way out.</p>

  <p>"Let's leave quickly. After successfully passing this part, we should be able to reach the first branch!" Vivian said, trying to seem brave.</p>

  <p>Seeing what Harley had suffered, the group did not stop, not even to catch their breath. They were all afraid that the Ailanthus Venomous Bugs would catch up to them once again.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Zheng's eyes flickered with a faint green light. Through the dense white mist, he could see a thick branch!</p>

  <p>Just one branch alone was thick enough to support a city!</p>

  <p>This sorcerer race had been an extremely powerful race in remote ages, and this Sacred Ailanthus was the sacred place where the sorcerer race had dwelt.</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerers of the sorcerer race were also at the same level as the Supreme Lords. Among them, there had been one of the grand sorcerers who even had one of the most powerful Heavenly Destiny in the entire universe!</p>

  <p>This Heavenly Destiny was powerful enough to instill fear in everyone, even those in modern times would still quake at the thought.</p>

  <p>It was said that the grand sorcerer who possessed this Heavenly Destiny only needed to know the name and appearance of his enemy, and then he would be able to turn his thought into a ferocious attack and kill the enemy by merely imagining that scene! He was therefore killing with his mind.</p>

  <p>That meant that if Luo Zheng mastered this Heavenly Destiny, he only needed to picture the scene of him killing someone after knowing what the person looked like. That person would be killed immediately! Like the snap of his fingers!</p>

  <p>The imagination of living beings was limitless, who could resist such a terrifying Heavenly Destiny?</p>

  <p>This was truly a killing method that could be used simply by thinking about it.</p>

  <p>However, for some unknown reason, this sorcerer race had suddenly disappeared from the universe, and not even a trace of them, their elders, or their weapons could be found!</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race, which originally controlled thousands of supreme worlds, was a highly intelligent and large race even in the ancient times.</p>

  <p>However, the entire sorcerer race disappeared mysteriously, and even the bones of this race could no longer be found in any of the sacred places.</p>

  <p>This matter was considered a wondrous story of this grand era, and up until now, it had been seen as a huge mystery!</p>

  <p>"We can go straight up, so why are we stopping here on this tree branch?" Luo Zheng asked as he nimbly stepped onto the huge tree branch.</p>

  <p>Vivian shook her head and said, "It's not that easy from the first tree branch onward. There is a powerful killing spell hidden within. If you don't follow the path on the tree and fly directly up instead, your body will explode! There is no exception!"</p>

  <p>The first time that they had opened the Deadwood Gate, even Aurora had exploded and died. Only after several explorations did everyone slowly figure out that the Sacred Ailanthus could not just be casually climbed!</p>

  <p>Under Vivian's lead, they cautiously walked along the tree branch for a while without encountering any further danger.</p>

  <p>"Aurora and the others have already gone up. The trap on the tree branch should have been cleared away. When the Deadwood Gate opens next time, the insects and beasts on the tree branch will appear again", Vivian explained.</p>

  <p>Without any obstacles to slow them down, everyone advanced at an extremely fast pace.</p>

  <p>Not long after, they arrived at the end of the tree branch. There they found an ancient wooden plate. On this wooden plate, there were fist-sized skulls which were neatly arranged on it. These skulls were so small. And there was no doubt as to their origin. Everyone could tell that these were not adults' skulls, but babies' skulls.</p>

  <p>Reaching this conclusion, Luo Zheng couldn't help but frown.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race gave him a very strange feeling, and he began to suspect that he disliked this race immensely.</p>

  <p>"Walking up to the wooden plate is the only way to break the curse. This is an ancient ritual of the sorcerer race", said Vivian as she was the first to walk onto the wooden plate.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng and the others had stepped onto the wooden plate, it began to slowly rotate. At the same time, all the small skulls began to jabber, continually opening and closing their mouths, letting out weird sounds. It was a frightful ruckus and made everyone look about nervously.</p>

  <p>They were all brave warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. With their great strength, they should not be afraid of even the most evil things. However, the sound that reverberated throughout this empty space from the small babbling craniums, still made their hair stand on end.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the wooden plate stopped spinning. Immediately, all the small skulls stopped their movement and there was silence again.</p>

  <p>Beneath everyone's feet, a shallow ray of light began flashing. This light began to scribble in the air, creating a profound calligraphy.</p>

  <p>After the words appeared, Vivian said, "Okay, we can continue to move up now!"</p>

  <p>It was these golden words that could destroy the killing spell!</p>

  <p>The group continued to ascend.</p>

  <p>Not long after, they arrived at another tree branch. They once again entered it and found another wooden plate. After obtaining another line of scribbled words, they once again ascended.</p>

  <p>After repeating this process seven more times, Luo Zheng and the others finally managed to climb up to the seventh tree branch!</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng began to climb up this tree branch, he could feel a strong Mu Ning of power emanating from within the tree branch.</p>

  <p>"We've caught up to them!" At this moment, Vivian's face also lit up with joy as she said, "Those ogre martial artists weren't strong enough to break through Aurora's Falling Leaves Array!"</p>

  <p>What Vivian had worried about the most was that she had now brought reinforcements, only to find that Aurora and her group had been slain and driven back to the main city by these ogre warriors. It would have meant that they had arrived too late.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows arched slightly as he suddenly turned into a bright streak of light, arced through the air and landed on the top most part of the branch. He gazed forward…</p>

  <p>At the end of the tree branch, Amber stood guard, holding a thin sword in her hand. Her eyes were filled with great vigor, and she radiated a special momentum.</p>

  <p>Ever since Amber had ascended, she had been trapped in a state of despair.</p>

  <p>She did not even have a chance to appreciate the grandeur of the Upper World, nor did she comprehend the berserk vitality that existed between heaven and earth. She had been sent straight to prison by the Queen of Punishment, never to see the sun again.</p>

  <p>But this time, the opening of the Illusion Battlefield had given Amber a slight chance!</p>

  <p>She was like a prisoner who had been released from incarceration, breathing in the air of freedom for the first time in this vast world.</p>

  <p>Amber understood that the Illusion Battlefield was just a stage. She could do whatever she wanted here on this stage, and compete with the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. However, this stage would still end, when the time came. She would then have to return to the prison and continue bearing the solitary pain of despair.</p>

  <p>Because of Amber's outstanding performance and powerful strength, she had been invited by Aurora to be her companion.</p>

  <p>When the Illusion Battlefield had opened, all the warriors entering here were in the states which they had been in before stepping into the Illusion Battlefield. Hence, as Amber had always been in a prison, she didn't even have a weapon.</p>

  <p>The equipment she carried now had been given to her as gifts by Aurora.</p>

  <p>When Aurora had learned of Amber's plight, after she had arrived in the Illusion Battlefield, she had solemnly vowed that once the Illusion Battlefield ended, she would help Amber to win her freedom back!</p>

  <p>Aurora was also a descendant of a Demon Night world lord. Her mother held a seat on the Board of Elders.</p>

  <p>However, when Aurora heard that the Queen of Punishment had personally imprisoned Amber, and tied her up to be corroded, she became silent.</p>

  <p>Recently, no one of the Demon Night would dare to stand against the Queen of Punishment. A few years ago, even the head of the Board of Elders was killed by the Queen of Punishment! Now, no one was safe.</p>

  <p>However, since Aurora had even considered freeing Amber, she was very happy with this small gesture. Aurora was her only friend in the Upper World!</p>

  <p>In these three times passing through the Deadwood Gate, Amber had voluntarily given up her Illusion Points, and given them all to Aurora.</p>

  <p>This was the only thing Amber could do to help her.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that this time, just as they had reached the seventh tree branch, they would be attacked by a roaring group of ogre martial artists!</p>

  <p>For the past few hours, they had been struggling to hold on by using Aurora's Falling Leaves Array and Amber's well-honed sword techniques.</p>

  <p>The truth was that even if she died, it wouldn't be a tragedy. At least the time Amber had spent in this Illusion Battlefield was a happy memory for her. She held the sword lightly and looked at Aurora, who was controlling the Falling Leaves Array. Facing the chaotic attack of the ogre warriors, Amber, however, felt a sense of peace descend on her.</p>

  <p>Above this tree branch, there were many thumb-sized leaves scattered about in an intricate pattern.</p>

  <p>The edges of these leaves were like the razor edge of a blade. If one did not pay attention, these leaves could easily cut through both forceful energy and flesh.</p>

  <p>It was also these sharp leaves that had shredded and created utter mayhem, and had blocked the attacks of more than ten ogre martial artists!</p>

  <p>All the ogre martial artists were riled up and irritable. They stamped their great feet and grunted with malcontent.</p>

  <p>Once the ogres stepped into the Falling Leaves Array, not only would they have to face being cut to pieces by the exceptionally sharp leaves, but they would also have to face the sword radiance of the woman of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>"This time, I must rush through. I must rip these women of the Demon Night apart, and spill their blood with my blade," an ogre warrior standing in the middle roared desperately. It was obvious that this group of ogre warriors had finally lost their last ounce of patience.</p>
