  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1456 Human Pyramid (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>The Endless Abyss in the underground palace seemed to be much easier to pass than those legendary dangerous places of similar renown in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>This abyss was constructed by the Supreme Lord from remote ages through substantial effort. These warriors even saw this underground palace as a trial, where they could obtain golden opportunities and precious treasures. It was a means for testing themselves, and finding their measures.</p>

  <p>However, only now did they realize that they had seriously miscalculated.</p>

  <p>Anyone who was not careful in this abyss would immediately be killed!</p>

  <p>After the warrior was ripped into pieces, his broken limbs fell down above everyone's heads. As they descended relatively slower than those alive warriors, the warriors were constantly below the bloody shower which followed them.</p>

  <p>"Another one!" a fighter screamed with a note of fear in his voice.</p>

  <p>Just as the voice rang out, the crowd heard a whistling sound coming from below, heading straight for them. It grew in intensity as the noise drew near.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was on the left side of the abyss at this time, and the diamond-shaped ice crystal was only the size of a person. So it seemed that he would not get hit by the diamond-shaped ice crystal.</p>

  <p>There were dozens of warriors falling down in the abyss at the same time, and the diamond-shaped ice crystals were rising at a much faster speed. Even if they noticed the diamond-shaped ice crystals, it would not be easy to dodge them during their descent. There was little room for them to maneuver.</p>

  <p>Previously, as they were passing through the Blade Mountain Trap, they had maintained a careful distance from the walls of the abyss. When several giant blades appeared, they would nimbly adjust their positions by pushing the abyss walls. But now there were ice spikes growing on the walls, so this method was obviously no longer suitable as the walls had become like a giant cheese grater and would shred anyone who came too close to them.</p>

  <p>The assault of these diamond-shaped ice crystals were like the uncertain coming of a death god, killing indiscriminately. The fate of most martial artists in the abyss could now only depend on their good luck or bad luck.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In almost the blink of an eye, the diamond-shaped ice crystal shot toward Freya at an extremely fast speed. She instantly froze in place as she saw death hurtling towards her.</p>

  <p>Seeing the diamond-shaped ice crystal shooting towards her, Freya's face paled. She tried her best to avoid the fast approaching death object, but she was unable to fly into the air, and had no way to gain the momentum to change her position. The difficulty of avoiding it was simply too great.</p>

  <p>She watched helplessly as it approached.</p>

  <p>At the last second, she almost twisted her waist into a bow, but was still unable to avoid the diamond-shaped ice crystal.</p>

  <p>'That human girl is going to die!' the other warriors all thought.</p>

  <p>Freya had almost stopped breathing as she stared at the diamond-shaped ice crystal with a look of sheer despair on her face. As what she had already seen before, the only result she could achieve was to freeze, and turn into ice scraps after being hit by the diamond-shaped ice crystal.</p>

  <p>Because the speed was simply too fast, she didn't have the time to crumb the divine texture to return to the entrance of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a black ray of light shot overhead at an even faster speed. Before the diamond-shaped ice crystal struck Freya, the black ray of light had already struck the diamond-shaped ice crystal.</p>

  <p>"Clank! Clank! Clank..."</p>

  <p>The black light had hit and instantly shattered the diamond-shaped ice crystal, showering Freya with its icy remains.</p>

  <p>When the diamond-shaped ice crystal exploded, it had released strong cold energy. After Freya passed through that layer of cold energy, her entire body was snow-white, as if she had been covered in a layer of frost. Icicles even hung from her clothes and hair.</p>

  <p>She subconsciously turned her head to look at Zheng, who was holding onto a long bow. He fell backward in the air, with his chest facing upwards. The bow in his hand was still vibrating, as that black light had been the arrow that Zheng had shot when she was in danger.</p>

  <p>Although she had been in despair just now, she had still clung to one belief for salvation. At this time, only Zheng could save her. However, an apologetic look appeared on her face all of a sudden. She felt ashamed of needing Zheng's protection constantly in the underground palace.</p>

  <p>She hadn't wanted to cause trouble for Zheng in the first place, but she'd been bothering him all the way up, since they'd entered the underground palace. So she felt so sorry now.</p>

  <p>As Zheng saw the apologetic look in Freya's eyes, he only smiled, and with a flick of his finger, a red pill shot towards Freya. Zheng had collected a lot of pills in his space ring. That was a Heating Pill, which was able to catalyze one's life vitality and emit a great amount of heat, although it was not a high level pill. Freya practiced the cultivation method of the ice attribute, but the cold energy emitted from the diamond-shaped ice crystal had still been too much for her to take. Her body was shaking heavily from the chill, and she gratefully accepted the Heating Pill.</p>

  <p>Although the cold energy of this diamond-shaped ice crystal was terrifying and its speed was difficult to dodge, it was only an ice crystal after all. As long as one didn't come into contact with it, you could easily survive it by shattering it in advance. It was simply a matter of avoiding the ice, and remaining alert.</p>

  <p>Everyone had already gotten ready again for the approaching diamond-shaped ice crystals. Some of the human warriors pulled out a row of flying knifes in their hands. As for the warriors of the Demon Night, they all took out their bows.</p>

  <p>"Shoop! Shoop!"</p>

  <p>Accompanied by two whistling sounds, two more diamond-shaped ice crystals shot out from the bottom of the abyss! Their frigid shapes were quickly approaching.</p>
