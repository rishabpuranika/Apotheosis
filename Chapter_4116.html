<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey took a few steps forward, carefully studying the relief sculpture on the platform.</p>

  <p>The relief of the Snake Spirit King was extremely intricate, but something caught Geoffrey's eyes.</p>

  <p>It seemed some parts of the carving were smelted, as though someone had tried to burn them.</p>

  <p>Did someone climb to the top of the pillar to destroy the relief before?</p>

  <p>The pillar was undoubtedly very solid. Geoffrey wouldn't have been able to damage it, even if he tried.</p>

  <p>Back when he was at the foot of the pillar, he had asked Ziya to give it a try, but even Ziya couldn't leave a mark on the pillar.</p>

  <p>Except for these strangely burnt parts, there was nothing exquisite about the relief.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey frowned in disappointment.</p>

  <p>It hadn't been easy for him to climb all this way, yet the journey seemed fruitless.</p>

  <p>At the very least, he had helped the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord connect the sword to the eleventh stair.</p>

  <p>An Other Shore Token on the eleventh stair was supposedly quite decent; however it was still connected to a red light beam like before. This meant it was surely inferior compared to the Other Shore Tokens on the last ten stairs.</p>

  <p>'If I drill a square hole here and insert the black stone in it, will it work?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's eyes flashed excitedly as he came up with this bold idea.</p>

  <p>But he dismissed the idea just as quickly as he hatched it.</p>

  <p>The pillar was too solid. There was no possible way he'd be able to dig a hole in it!</p>

  <p>'What if I asked Ziya for help...'</p>

  <p>It had taken him several months to climb to the top of the pillar, which meant it'd take several more months to go down. Thus, it would take him nearly a year to make a round trip.</p>

  <p>As he pondered over this, he inadvertently walked to the center of the platform, where the Snake Spirit King's eyes lay.</p>

  <p>Without even looking where he was going, Geoffrey accidentally stepped right on the Snake Spirit King's eyes. Then, the sky began to stir, as though it was unsettled.</p>

  <p>Initially, the sky of the main world was as dark as a moonless night.</p>

  <p>Whenever he looked up, the sky was always pitch black.</p>

  <p>But the instant Geoffrey stepped on the Snake Spirit King's eyes, he noticed a huge courtyard floating nearby.</p>

  <p>It was floating in the center of the four pillars.</p>

  <p>Upon a closer look, Geoffrey realized the courtyard was tethered by thick chains that glowed brightly. The glowing chains were connected to the tops of the four pillars.</p>

  <p>"Why is there a courtyard here?" Geoffrey's mouth fell open in shock.</p>

  <p>Back when he was at the foot of the pillar, he didn't notice any courtyard.</p>

  <p>But from where he stood now, it was impossible to miss!</p>

  <p>Right underneath the courtyard were three cone-shaped stones. It looked as though the floating, massive stones were supporting the courtyard, keeping it afloat.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's gaze shifted from the bottom of the courtyard to its top. His eyes suddenly widened in shock.</p>

  <p>"The sky... Is this the real sky of the Abstruse Energy World?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the sky had changed miraculously.</p>

  <p>Instead of the pitch blackness, the sky was now a deep and three-dimensional space.</p>

  <p>It was as though it extended infinitely, with strange yet beautiful things floating around in it.</p>

  <p>A huge, windmill-shaped object floated far away, with its wheel spinning unimaginably fast.</p>

  <p>In the distance, a shape that almost resembled a sphere glowed a deep red, almost like a sun, but it kept changing shape.</p>

  <p>In addition, there were also some fragments floating within its orbit.</p>

  <p>Everything seemed so far yet so huge. Geoffrey was in utter awe.</p>

  <p>For a long time, he stared blankly into the sky in wonder.</p>

  <p>When he finally snapped back to reality, he took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Everything disappeared in an instant. Even the courtyard was gone.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, he took a step backward, and the sky changed once more.</p>

  <p>"Is this some trick of the Four Spirits Sect?"</p>

  <p>Although it felt a little strange, Geoffrey's interest was definitely piqued.</p>

  <p>Once he figured out that the trick was to step on the Snake Spirit King's eyes, an idea flashed through his mind. 'What if I try climbing onto that courtyard?'</p>

  <p>The courtyard was connected to the pillar he was on by a thick chain.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey could easily cross over to the courtyard through the chain.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he could check out the other three pillars, since the courtyard was chained to them, too.</p>

  <p>The only catch was, if he stepped away from the Snake Spirit King's eyes, everything would disappear.</p>

  <p>However, did they? the courtyard, the chains, and the sky? truly disappear? Or were they just invisible?</p>

  <p>After memorizing the location of the chain, Geoffrey took a deep breath and left the Snake Spirit King's eyes. Cautiously, he walked towards the platform's edge.</p>

  <p>He felt his way along the edge carefully, until his fingers brushed against something cold. It was a link in the chain!</p>

  <p>Each link was about ten feet wide. Although the chain was completely invisible, Geoffrey was confident he would be able to navigate.</p>

  <p>The distance from the pillar to the courtyard was long, about half the distance between the two pillars. It was at least a ten-day climb to reach the courtyard.</p>

  <p>After climbing for a few hundred feet, Geoffrey looked down.</p>

  <p>He trembled slightly as he realized there was nothing under him.</p>

  <p>If he fell from such a height, there was no possible way he'd survive.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Star Crane City, Crane Blood Province, Source World, a huge stone heart was beating slowly yet energetically.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Thearch lay on the throbbing stone, staring into space blankly.</p>

  <p>His once incredibly strong body was now extremely weak.</p>

  <p>Claire occupying his body was taxing enough in itself, but the price he had to pay when she was defeated after descending to the Source World was even more unimaginable.</p>

  <p>He was lucky to be alive, but now, the Yellow Thearch was overcome with regret.</p>

  <p>He had chosen to join the Element Spirit Civilization to grow in strength.</p>

  <p>But the so-called strength of the Element Spirit Civilization turned out to be bait!</p>

  <p>And the Yellow Thearch fell for it. After taking the bait, he had now become the Element Spirit Civilization's puppet.</p>

  <p>Now, there was no turning back. He had absolutely no ability to resist, and was completely subject to their control.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>Someone was approaching.</p>

  <p id="top_17">Although the Yellow Thearch's body was badly damaged, he could still acutely sense things around him.</p>

  <p>Instantly he knew that the person approaching him was the Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>"What're you doing here?" the Yellow Thearch asked sourly.</p>

  <p>After the battle with the Pear Hill, the Divine Farmer had actually rescued him.</p>

  <p>But secretly, the Yellow Thearch loathed the Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>It would've been better to die in battle than to continue living as a puppet.</p>

  <p>"The Eye Spirit has sent a message," said the Divine Farmer calmly.</p>

  <p>"The Eye Spirit" were the last three words that the Yellow Thearch wanted to hear, but he had no choice. With a sigh, he struggled to sit up.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Eye Spirit could be spying on them at any given time.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" the Yellow Thearch asked tiredly.</p>

  <p>"Kill the Evil God," the Divine Farmer said bluntly.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Thearch laughed bitterly. "How are we supposed to do that, especially in this condition?"</p>

  <p>In the battle with the Pear Hill, two of the three Chaos Ancient Gods who advocated the Purge Way had perished. Othniel was the only survivor, but no one knew where he was now. How could they possibly kill the Evil God after they suffered such huge losses?</p>

  <p>"We have to do it. The Eye Spirit will help us." The Divine Farmer shrugged.</p>

  <p>"He will help us? How?"</p>

  <p>"We still have Othniel. The Element Spirit Civilization will support us, and the Eye Spirit said he will teach us a special method." There was a hint of excitement in the Divine Farmer's voice.</p>

  <p>"What method?"</p>

  <p>"The Blood-controlling Method. It's a method to activate the bloodline theurgies, developed from outside the chaos..."</p>
