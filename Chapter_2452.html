<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2452 Dangerous </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If it was a group of ordinary snakes, no matter how many they were, they wouldn't pose much of a threat to these True Gods.</p>

  <p>Even if they somehow got stuck in a sea of those snakes, it wouldn't be much of a threat.</p>

  <p>These True Gods were so skilled that any number of snakes would be crushed to smithereens before they could even move an inch in their direction.</p>

  <p>"So what? They are just snakes. Burn them to death!"</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>One of the disciples of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands took out a black fire dragon.</p>

  <p>The fire dragon charged into the sea of snakes, and then proceeded to fall and roll. The tens of thousands of writhing snakes were immediately burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>"Wind Demon, fulfill my command!"</p>

  <p>A light green shadow was formed in the hands of another top-rank True God. It was the Wind Demon. Once the shadow had condensed itself, it immediately turned into a strong wind and tunneled into the sea of snakes, cutting them to pieces.</p>

  <p>Under attacks from all sides, the snakes were unable to rise from the sea.</p>

  <p>The threat had been constrained.</p>

  <p>Even the flying snakes from the sky were instantly killed.</p>

  <p>"Haha! These snakes are not that dangerous. Even in large numbers, they are easily restrained. Why should we be afraid of them?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, Burke, why are you scared of these snakes?"</p>

  <p>"These snakes are easily killed."</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods really didn't give the snakes much thought.</p>

  <p>"It's not what you think," said Burke quietly. "They might not be much of a threat now, but they will grow stronger and stronger with time!"</p>

  <p>"And how strong can they get, exactly?" someone scoffed disdainfully.</p>

  <p>There was, indeed, a small number of Snake Spirits remaining in the divine land. The vast majority of the True Gods had never seen or heard of them, so they didn't know how dangerous they were.</p>

  <p>"They are unimaginably strong. If we can't drive the Snake Spirit out, they will grow strong and large enough to swallow even the consummate True Gods whole!" said Reinhard, his voice somber. With a wave of his hand, dazzling sword lights spread in all directions. The flying snakes in the sky were then immediately cut into smithereens, and the fragments were scattered in the wind.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had finished, someone spoke, "The situation is indeed different. These snakes have grown stronger! Look there, those are level-one ferocious beasts in Forbidden Land of Fallen Leaves."</p>

  <p>There were many kinds of snakes in the divine land, and the difference in strength between them was considerable. Ordinary divine citizens could kill the weakest snakes, but some of the powerful snakes were recorded in ancient legends and could even fight against Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, the most powerful snakes were reclusive beasts. They tended to lurk out of sight, and thus were rarely seen.</p>

  <p>Reinhard had heard the legend of the Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit was a very special creature. In fact, it was not a creature at all. It was the embodiment of a snake curse cast in the ancient times.</p>

  <p>When a Snake Spirit appeared, it could summon an enormous number of its snake underlings, forming a legion large enough to devour all the creatures around it, leaving nothing alive.</p>

  <p>Reinhard had read the ancient books about the Snake Spirit in the Sword Clan. According to those stories, the Snake Spirit had appeared three times so far, and each time it had appeared, it had caused enormous devastation, destroying entire divine cities.</p>

  <p>It had completely demolished two divine cities with the Thousand Commandments Slate, and another one with the Hundred Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>The slates protecting the divine cities were extremely powerful, and there were many top-rank True Gods living there. One of the divine cities that had been destroyed by the Snake Spirit had been guarded by a consummate True God, and it had, nevertheless, succumbed. The True Gods within the city were all devoured by the innumerable snakes.</p>

  <p>The snakes they had encountered just now had been the weak type, so killing them had been easy.</p>

  <p>Now, however, they faced level-one ferocious beasts from a forbidden land.</p>

  <p>Although they weren't the most powerful beasts of their kind, they were not as weak as the ones that had preceded them, and killing them would not be that easy.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they would soon evolve into ferocious beasts of even higher levels.</p>

  <p>"If we stay here, we will surely die! We have to leave as soon as possible!</p>

  <p>The only way we can stop more snakes emerging is by finding and killing the Snake Spirit! If you want to survive, you must follow me!" Reinhard announced, a trace of desperation in his voice.</p>

  <p>Then he and his avatar took the lead, deliberately and quickly moving forward.</p>

  <p>Reinhard and his avatar brandished their swords at the same time. The sword lights quickly created an illusory world, and countless rays of sword radiation escaped from it, forming a whirlwind that moved forward, unstoppable.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The whirlwind scattered the snakes, creating an enormous gap in the middle of the sea.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng and Yan followed Reinhard without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the other True Gods did the same.</p>

  <p>Some True Gods were a little hesitant at first. However, looking upon the boundless sea of snakes, they realized the seriousness of the situation and decided to follow Reinhard and the others.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, Yan, help me open the way. I will look for the Snake Spirit!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard commanded.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "You can count on me!"</p>

  <p>Then, Xun's long spear shot through the air, as fast as a bolt of lightning. All the snakes that were caught in it were minced into pieces. For a moment, the smell of blood and burning flesh filled the air.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's Tribulation Exterminating Sword was still swirling at a high speed.</p>

  <p>There were way too many snakes in this place, so the Tribulation Exterminating Sword aimed randomly.</p>

  <p>"Sword orders cannot be disobeyed. You don't need to report to me if you meet the weak type of snakes. But tell me immediately if you see any strong ones!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard's goal, of course, was to exterminate all these countless little snakes. However, he could only let the Tribulation Exterminating Sword ignore these low-level ferocious beasts for now, in order to concentrate on finding the more powerful Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he noticed that the Tribulation Exterminating Sword had become slow to react and no longer seemed to be responding to the sea of snakes.</p>

  <p>After making a few circles, the sword let out a light roar, and then pointed sharply to the front left.</p>

  <p>"In front, and to the left! Here it is!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard gripped the Tribulation Exterminating Sword tightly in his hands, and the sword emitted a ray of blue light. "I've locked it. Charge!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Xun, who had been the first to rush forward, suddenly changed her direction, now running in the direction pointed at by the Tribulation Exterminating Sword.</p>

  <p>But right at this moment, the sea of snakes began to change again.</p>

  <p>The green snakes disappeared, and smaller, bright red snakes took their place.</p>

  <p>"Red Phosphorus Snakes! They are level two ferocious beasts! They are extremely venomous and can even spit toxic fire!"</p>

  <p>"In just five minutes, the snakes have evolved into level two ferocious beasts!"</p>

  <p>"If we delay even a second longer, will they turn into level three or four ferocious beasts?"</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods didn't feel particularly threatened in the face of the green snakes. After all, it was difficult for low-level ferocious beasts to hurt them.</p>

  <p>However, the Red Phosphorus Snakes were much more difficult to deal with than the green snakes, especially as there were so many of them!</p>

  <p>It was not until then that the True Gods realized that what Reinhard said was absolutely right. In order to survive, they had to find out the Snake Spirit and kill it as soon as they could!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The Red Phosphorus Snakes came in great numbers. They reared their horrifying heads, opened their mouths and spat out corrosive, toxic fires.</p>

  <p>The toxic fire emitted by a single Red Phosphorus Snake was not threatening at all. It was, after all, quite small.</p>

  <p>However, the amount of fire that this enormous number of Red Phosphorus Snakes could emit was dangerous, if not lethal.</p>

  <p>"The Parting Water Enchanted Barrier!"</p>

  <p>"The Enchanted Barrier of Five Elements!"</p>

  <p>"Light of the Shield!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods present each used their own means to block the poisonous fires.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't seem afraid of these Red Phosphorus Snakes at all. He had rushed to the front, taking the lead.</p>

  <p>He had no care for either poison or fire. It was no threat to him.</p>

  <p>These Red Phosphorus Snakes were level two ferocious beasts. Zheng had killed a huge number of them effortlessly, with an air of being completely at ease, as though he were chopping vegetables, not killing countless venomous creatures. However, the speed with which he was moving was too slow to be efficient.</p>

  <p>"We can't go on like this!" Still maintaining control over the Tribulation Exterminating Sword, Reinhard yelled, "The Snake Spirit is fleeing. I'm afraid we can't catch up! We only have fifteen minutes."</p>

  <p>The snakes would evolve every five minutes.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what kind of snake would come next, but they were sure that it would be a level three beast. And after another five minutes, level four beasts would come.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Spirit managed to fill this vast land with level five beasts, even the consummate True Gods would face certain death.</p>
