<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that time, dominated by the intent of the cyan dragon, he was torn and smashed unceasingly. The pain he had suffered when he was still at the Luo house was more intolerable than what he was experiencing now.</p>

  <p>"This pain is nothing! I should just treat it as exercise for my soul!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured in a bid to encourage himself to stay strong. He shook his head and tried to work up the courage to continue walking into the hall.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng found that he could march further into the hall for tier 4 cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>As he approached the small wooden bookcase, despite the attacks of the shadows, Luo Zheng noticed that there was a passageway behind the hall.</p>

  <p>"Why would there be a passageway here? Isn't the hall for tier 4 cultivation methods the last hall?" Luo Zheng was a little shocked.</p>

  <p>Ever since he was a child, Luo Zheng had heard that there were only four tiers of cultivation methods. He had never heard of a cultivation method higher than tier 4.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, his curiosity was aroused. 'Perhaps I should enter the passageway and see if there are any higher-tier cultivation methods, ' thought Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Still undecided, Luo Zheng took a minute to skim the bookcase in this hall. Tier 4 cultivation methods highly tempted Luo Zheng. Earlier, access to a tier 3 cultivation method would have pleased Luo Zheng. He had never dreamed of being in a position to access a tier 4 cultivation method!</p>

  <p>After hesitating and thinking for a while, Luo Zheng found that he couldn't abjure his curiosity.</p>

  <p>Others didn't have a chance to enter the hall for tier 4 cultivation methods, but he did. Now that he had come this far, why shouldn't he try to find out whether there were higher-tier cultivation methods?</p>

  <p>At this thought, Luo Zheng decided to explore the passageway.</p>

  <p>The passageway was not wide or spacious. It wasn't well decorated either. The floors and walls of the corridor had rotten over time. As soon as Luo Zheng entered the corridor, which was about 10 feet long, he felt a reprieve from the attack of the purple shadows.</p>

  <p>'The overwhelming intent of the Vengeful Beast doesn't exist here?' Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>Curious and bewildered, Luo Zheng marched ahead. At the end of the corridor was a stone chamber.</p>

  <p>The chamber was circular, and not very big. In the center stood a black monument.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened when he realized that this chamber was a graveyard.</p>

  <p>As soon as this thought dawned on Luo Zheng, a supernatural beast formed by condensed purple light rushed out of the monument.</p>

  <p>The monster resembled one of the purple shadows Luo Zheng had encountered inside the hall for tier 4 cultivation methods. Comparatively, it looked more real in this chamber. It was purple all over and looked lifelike. A deep hatred could be seen in its eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is the Vengeful Beast's graveyard! Then, this monster is perhaps the soul of the dead Vengeful Beast. This beast is so indomitable that its intent is still perceivable in this space even though it has been dead for many years. The intent of the Vengeful Beast is still remarkable as well! But who on earth killed the Vengeful Beast here?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng whispered as he carefully observed the monster. The soul of the Vengeful Beast was much stronger than the intangible shadows. Besides, Luo Zheng felt more pressure from this monster. The spiritual attack of the monster was so strong that Luo Zheng felt as though someone was pounding on his head with a hammer when the beast glared at him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had put himself in extreme danger!</p>

  <p>His soul would be torn away in a flash if the Vengeful Beast's soul attacked him. If that happened, Luo Zheng would turn into a soulless idiot.</p>

  <p>As soon as he realized the danger that lay ahead, Luo Zheng winced and stepped back in fear. He didn't want to disturb the soul of the Vengeful Beast and accidentally invite its brutal wrath.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng turned around to leave, he saw that the intangible shadows he had left behind in the hall had blocked the passageway. A bitter smile grew on his face when Luo Zheng realized the trap he had stepped into.</p>

  <p>'Cloud Sect is so insidious! I just want to choose a book on a cultivation method. Is it necessary to set such dangerous traps?' Luo Zheng couldn't help sighing.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng didn't know was that very few people at Cloud Sect could enter the hall for tier 4 cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>The power of one's soul was not associated with his or her strength. Even powerful people who had reached the nature level would be unable to step into the hall for tier 4 cultivation methods if their soul wasn't powerful enough. Such people would be never able to enter the tomb behind the hall.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng took a few steps back to get away from the soul of the Vengeful Beast, the intangible shadows in the passageway flew straight towards him like frightened bats. At the same time, the soul of the Vengeful Beast roared and abruptly jumped to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now the situation was indeed terrible.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng was so panicked that he couldn't think clearly. After quickly weighing his options, Luo Zheng rushed toward the intangible shadows in the passageway. He knew that he would be in extreme agony if the shadows attacked his soul. Luo Zheng also understood that it would be better to suffer pain from the attacks of the shadows than to be turned into an idiot by the soul behind him.</p>

  <p>Despite his swift action, the soul of the Vengeful Beast was faster. It almost came behind Luo Zheng in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Ow!"</p>

  <p>The Vengeful Beast's soul uttered a weird shriek. It was only about several inches away from Luo Zheng. If he turned to look, Luo Zheng was certain that he would be able to see his terrified expression in its dark eyes.</p>

  <p>At this critical moment, the huge furnace in his brain rotated slowly.</p>

  <p>From deep within him, a low growl was heard from a dragon.</p>

  <p>"It's the growling sound uttered by the sculpture of the cyan dragon!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the fearsome dragon growl was heard, the purple shadows that were attacking Luo Zheng dispersed for fear of being attacked by the dragon.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the Vengeful Beast's soul jumped away from Luo Zheng. It was almost as if the Vengeful Beast's soul had been scorched from being too close to Luo Zheng. From a distance, it studied Luo Zheng as if on guard. Its dark eyes were full of fear. To Luo Zheng, it seemed as though the Vengeful Beast's soul was in a dilemma. On one hand, it wanted to rush fiercely toward Luo Zheng, but it didn't. Instead, it clawed the floor every time the dragon growled fiercely. Then the soul let out a low howl.</p>

  <p>This brought a smile to Zheng's face. He hadn't thought that the shadows and the Vengeful Beast were naturally fearful of the cyan dragon's growl.</p>

  <p>The Vengeful Beast's soul winced every time Luo Zheng took a step toward it.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked over to it, one step after another without stopping, the Vengeful Beast's soul jumped back onto the tombstone before letting out a ferocious howl. At last, the soul retreated into the black tombstone.</p>

  <p>Its grudges were evidently manifested in its howl. These were also perceived by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng was in grave danger. His soul would have been killed had the cyan dragon not awoken and come to his rescue.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng had gotten past the dangers. Because of that, a flat smile grew on Zheng's face. Then, he began to explore the stone chamber.</p>

  <p>When he had first entered this chamber, Luo Zheng had noticed a bookcase near the black monument.</p>

  <p>He walked toward the bookcase. When close enough, he saw that the bookcase contained two books on cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>'Why are there only two books on cultivation methods? What on earth are they about?' wondered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out and took one of the two books off the bookcase. This book looked very old and shabby. Since a thick layer of dust covered the book and he was unable to read its title, Luo Zheng patted the book to remove the dust. It was then that he could see several big words on the cover.</p>

  <p>'Heavenly Ogre Fist!'</p>
