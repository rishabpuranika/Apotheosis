  <p>
</p>

  <p>The four massive pillars had some sort of a strict ruling in which every thread was not to be touched or moved.</p>

  <p>No one was allowed to change their positions without authorization.</p>

  <p>Anyone who broke the rule would have to face severe consequences.</p>

  <p>After Luo Nian moved one of the threads, at the end of the staircase, a statue suddenly came to life. Its eyes glowed a red light, and its body trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Anyone..."</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Luo Nian, this statue had been asleep for countless years and was practically a few steps away from disintegrating into a pile of dust. If this had taken place a while back, the statue would've leapt into action immediately, killing the intruders on the spot.</p>

  <p>However, it was way past its prime. Its stone body had practically melded into the ground it stood upon.</p>

  <p>Statues weren't supposed to rot, but this one did. In comparison, the four statues of the Eternal Divine Courtyard were much luckier.</p>

  <p>Because of the existence of the Time Lock, they were destined to continue in pristine condition, unlike the statue that angrily flashed its red eyes at Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The statue felt the energy fluctuations coming from the pillar, and desperately tried to free its legs from the ground.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't take long before all its energy was used up, and its eyes quickly dimmed till it was lifeless once more.</p>

  <p>This whole time, Luo Nian didn't know what was going on above. Upon climbing to the 500th stair, he found that the threads of light here were connected to much more Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Stretching out his hand, he lightly brushed some threads of light closest to him, and had visions pertaining to where the Other Shore Tokens were located.</p>

  <p>"This inner world is full of fish," he cried in amusement, as the Other Shore Tokens revealed to him many different inner worlds.</p>

  <p>"What a disgusting inner world! There is sticky blood everywhere.</p>

  <p>None of these looks enticing..."</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Nian found an inner world full of humans.</p>

  <p>"This guy must be a human..."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian didn't know whether the owner of this inner world was friend or foe, nor did he care. The only thing on his mind now was his insatiable curiosity with a hint of mischievousness.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he dug out the square stone under the thread and inserted it into the first black pit on the inner side.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Rose Sect of Li Shan mountain, the sect leader Emily was leading over a hundred disciples to cultivate a unique cultivation method.</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Zheng had given enough Chaotic Source Spirits to Emily. With those spirits, she might be the last one to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Additionally, she was the one who helped bring Yan and Luo Zheng into the Source World, so she was trained with utmost priority by the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Now, the Rose Sect was the most popular among the small sects of the Li Shan mountain. Anyone with a discerning eye could see that it wouldn't be long before it became a powerful sect, and Emily would be promoted to the grand sect leader.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Just then, a beautiful female disciple who had been following Emily shrieked. The other disciples whipped their heads to see where the scream came from, only to find the female disciple trembling slightly, her face as pale as a ghost.</p>

  <p>Emily frowned. "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The female disciple sat there in shock, but answered Emily obediently, "My Other Shore Token seems to have been destroyed."</p>

  <p>This disciple had just entered Stage Four, and her Other Shore Token was very ordinary. However, Emily just so happened to be fond of her. Sooner or later, Emily was willing to help her obtain a powerful Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"Destroyed?" Emily's frown deepened. She too was stunned.</p>

  <p>The female disciple felt the gaze of the other disciples. Afraid that no one believed her, she summoned her Other Shore Token, a white stone flower.</p>

  <p>The stone flower looked pretty ordinary, as though it was a simple decorative paperweight. No energy fluctuations seemed to be pulsating within it.</p>

  <p>"Is this Other Shore Token really broken?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look like its energy has been depleted..."</p>

  <p>"How about replenishing it with the divine crystals?"</p>

  <p>The other female disciples of the Rose Sect broke into an uproar.</p>

  <p>Even the Other Shore Token that had used up all its energy would've reacted. This stone flower truly seemed to be an ordinary object.</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore, everything had energy. It was almost impossible to find something devoid of it!</p>

  <p>Emily's brows furrowed in confusion. She had never encountered such a situation.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The stone flower suddenly shook violently in the disciple's hand. A cold aura gushed out from it and enshrouded the entire hall. It seemed the Other Shore Token had been strengthened by at least twenty times in such a short time!</p>

  <p>"Eh?" the female disciple grunted confusedly, and even Emily was surprised.</p>

  <p>They had never seen Other Shore Tokens become stronger in this way.</p>

  <p>Back on the massive pillar, after Luo Nian once again changed the location of a thread, another strand of energy surged out from within the pillar.</p>

  <p>At the end of the staircase with one thousand pages, the eyes of the broken statue flickered once more, this time with an even brighter red light.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The statue finally managed to break free from its pedestal and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who dares to break in will be killed!" it explained, finally able to complete the sentence it was trying to utter earlier.</p>

  <p>This statue was designed to protect the huge pillar.</p>

  <p>Once untethered, the statue was actually quite nimble. It rushed down the stairs speedily.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Of course, the sound of the statue running caught Luo Nian's attention.</p>

  <p>As the statue closed in on its target, Luo Nian felt a sense of dread welling up within him. Standing at the edge of the staircase, he looked up towards the clamoring sound. Only then did he see the tattered statue rushing down the stairs.</p>

  <p>Instantly, Luo Nian realized that the statue was aiming for him.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to fight the statue, Luo Nian abruptly turned and ran down the stairs.</p>

  <p>However, the statue really was incredibly fast. In just a few moments, the distance between the two closed quickly. Luo Nian was somewhat slow because Ziya was behind him.</p>

  <p>Seeing there was no outrunning this statue, Luo Nian whipped around to make Ziya face the statue. Urgently, he patted Ziya on his right shoulder.</p>

  <p>All Ziya could see were the dense light dots in front of him. He knew that Luo Nian had climbed up the pillar.</p>

  <p>Without the slightest hesitation, he reached out to slap whatever was in front of him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Normally, creatures in the Abstruse Energy World wouldn't stand a chance against Ziya's palm attack.</p>

  <p>However, the statue on the pillar was by no means ordinary. Even a blow from Ziya just caused it to shake its head in a daze for a moment, but it quickly recovered.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian saw this scene, his eyes widened in fear. Ziya was probably no match for the statue, at least not in this form.</p>

  <p>In a rush, he grabbed Ziya's hand and yanked him towards the edge of the stair. Together, they jumped off the pillar and plummeted to the ground.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Upon landing on the ground, Luo Nian immediately jumped up and helped Ziya up as well.</p>

  <p>Ziya was confused. How did they fall? He didn't recall feeling any sort of impact from the statue's counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, when he stood up, he positioned his hands, ready to strike again.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, he felt Luo Nian yanking at the rope.</p>

  <p>No matter what happened, he had to follow Luo Nian, so he didn't have the time to try attacking again and decided to follow Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>The statue was not going to let Luo Nian go. Muttering something under its breath, the statue quickly spiraled down the stairs.</p>

  <p>As they ran, Luo Nian kept one eye on the pillar behind him. Then, he narrowed his eyes ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't deal with the statue here, he would have to lead it into the real world.</p>
