<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2845 Mixed Feelings </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The rings of light that shimmered under the feet of the disciples on the Floating Island disappeared.</p>

  <p>There was also a sudden chill coming from underground.</p>

  <p>And just like that, the two consummate True Gods had broken the Sea Mist Array.</p>

  <p>Several Demi-holy Beings were shocked at this development.</p>

  <p>Pierson, who Lorena had seriously hurt, was also stunned.</p>

  <p>He met these two formidable young warriors only a few days after he had reappeared in the public. A strange panic gripped his heart. This era seemed to no longer belong to those who were old.</p>

  <p>A figure clad in green approached them from a distance.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Iris.</p>

  <p>She rushed over to them as soon as she heard the noise in the transmission array.</p>

  <p>When she was on her way, the Demi-holy Being had activated the array.</p>

  <p>She had had to stop and contribute her Faith Energy to it.</p>

  <p>The moment the array disappeared, she started to make her way to them again.</p>

  <p>The first person she saw was Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Lowell!"</p>

  <p>Uncontrollable joy took hold of Iris's heart.</p>

  <p>She had been restless these past days, and now, she finally had her husband back!</p>

  <p>"Iris," Tianming uttered.</p>

  <p>Iris was about to go straight to Tianming, but Winthrop stopped her. "Iris, do you know who Lowell is?"</p>

  <p>Iris looked at her father and then at Tianming. A look of understanding crossed her face.</p>

  <p>Tianming's identity must have been exposed.</p>

  <p>Iris obviously knew that Tianming was not who he claimed to be.</p>

  <p>When Tianming had carried her and run in that abandoned city, she could not help becoming infatuated with him. That was why she had helped him hide his identity so that he could successfully infiltrate the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>"I know," Iris replied calmly.</p>

  <p>Winthrop looked equal parts shocked and disappointed. But he recovered enough to ask, "Do you know he has harmed our clan?"</p>

  <p>Iris glanced at Tianming and nodded. "I... I know that too."</p>

  <p>Iris hadn't known what Tianming was about to do, but she knew that he wasn't pretending to be a part of the Dongfang Clan for fun. She knew that he must have something important to deal with.</p>

  <p>But Iris had made up her mind that no matter what happened, she would be on Tianming's side.</p>

  <p>"You..." Winthrop stared at his daughter unhappily. "Do you know that he has killed Nicholas? If this news were to spread, everyone would only believe that my daughter is the cause for the Holy Emperor's death. It will bring disgrace on our clan!"</p>

  <p>Iris was amazed at what Winthrop was saying.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, no matter how powerful Tianming was, it was impossible for him to kill Nicholas.</p>

  <p>She looked back at Tianming, confused. She hoped that he would deny what Winthrop was saying, but he only looked at her silently, and did not say anything.</p>

  <p>So it was true!</p>

  <p>Iris was feeling so many mixed emotions in this moment.</p>

  <p>She had thought she would always forgive Tianming no matter what he did.</p>

  <p>But this time, he had killed the Holy Emperor of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was God to the members of the Dongfang Clan and no one had dared disobey him.</p>

  <p>Shock ran through Iris, blanking her mind to the point where her knowledge of the workings of the Dongfang Clan didn't allow her to come to a decision.</p>

  <p>Tianming looked at Iris beseechingly. He had foreseen what would happen the moment he had told Nicholas his identity.</p>

  <p>Lorena sneered, "This girl looks pretty. How can she shame the Dongfang Clan? I think she has done that to save your Dongfang Clan!"</p>

  <p>Winthrop glared at Lorena before saying, "I know I'm not powerful enough, but you can't humiliate me like that."</p>

  <p>Lorena shook her head and said, "The hatred between our Luo Clan and the Dongfang Clan is such that the Luo Clan would do everything in their power to kill Nicholas and destroy all the members of the Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>Winthrop, Pierson, and the others were startled at Lorena's words.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan members were capable of doing that if they made up their minds.</p>

  <p>"We won't do that though for the sake of this little girl," Lorena said, blinking and flashing a smile at Iris.</p>

  <p>She knew all about Tianming sneaking into the Dongfang Clan, and she also knew that he had done a lot for the Luo Clan, which was why she was now intervening on his behalf.</p>

  <p>"So this means that the girl is the savior of the Dongfang Clan. Am I wrong?" Lorena said.</p>

  <p>In fact, her words and logic were unreasonable.</p>

  <p>But the truth was nothing more than a stepping stone of strength in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan had lost its imposing aura and had no way of reasoning with Lorena.</p>

  <p>They might probably get killed if they put Iris in an awkward situation.</p>

  <p>Lorena was, in fact, threatening them.</p>

  <p>The members of the Dongfang Clan were silent. They knew they could not refute Lorena's words and didn't dare argue.</p>

  <p>Lorena winked at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming walked up to Iris and took her hand.</p>

  <p>Iris hesitated. She looked at her father and then Tianming, before finally deciding to leave with Tianming.</p>

  <p>Lorena's eyes then fell on Pierson. "Another thing. I think you have to go with me to the Ray Tree."</p>

  <p>"What kind of thing?"</p>

  <p>Pierson said coldly. He just wanted to send this group of people away as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"My husband died, and you suppressed him in the Ray Tree. It is time to return him now," Lorena said equally coldly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed at his mother's words.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since he had entered the divine land, but he hadn't known his father's whereabouts until now. If his father had died, he would have been reincarnated in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Pierson's eyes flashed, but he knew he had no strength to resist this woman.</p>

  <p>It was a while before he finally nodded.</p>

  <p>He stood up and led the others to the other side of the square.</p>

  <p>Half of the transmission arrays on the square were destroyed, and among the other half, the widest transmission array was the one that led to the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>Led by Pierson, Luo Zheng and his companions stepped into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng and the others left, the members of the Dongfang Clan were relieved, thinking that they had gotten rid of them for the time being.</p>

  <p>"Will they attack Pierson on the Ray Tree?"</p>

  <p>"It's of no use relying on the Ray Tree. Pierson, with his strength, is no match for them."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid our Dongfang Clan will be in trouble this time. That woman said she won't destroy our clan. But the Luo Clan has a grudge against us. I don't think they will let us off."</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Dongfang Clan were anxious and upset.</p>
