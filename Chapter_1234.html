  <p>
</p>

  <p>The pink light that Dorothea released was able to reveal the true form of this Cursed Land!</p>

  <p>Had Luo Luo Zheng been aware of the amount of ghosts that filled this Cursed Land, he wouldn't have ever thought of entering it in the first place.</p>

  <p>Even Woody and Delroy were obviously unsettled, prompting Dorothea to extinguish the pink light with a hint of a smile.</p>

  <p>Once the light was gone, any hint of ghosts disappeared and the black Cursed Land appeared as empty as it had been before.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff?</p>

  <p>"S-So disgusting!" Woody heaved as he touched his chest in mild alarm.</p>

  <p>Max also shook his head, "In that case, it seems impossible for us to break in."</p>

  <p>Delroy nodded at his words. "We can't resist these ghosts. We'll be devoured completely if we force our way in. It seems the only thing we can do is to report this matter to the upper leaders."</p>

  <p>Max sighed, "Our trip to the Lower World has been fruitless. We failed to capture the Evil Dragon. And the Ancestral Dragon..." He couldn't help but glance at Luo Luo Zheng upon mentioning the Ancestral Dragon that had since imprinted on Luo Luo Zheng. "Now that we can't confirm anything about the Tower of Crystal, are we really just going back empty-handed?"</p>

  <p>Delroy shrugged helplessly. "Well, what else do you want to do?"</p>

  <p>Max set his eyes on Luo Luo Zheng, his gaze somewhat calculating. "I want to enter the Tower of Crystal and take a look."</p>

  <p>Delroy couldn't help but roll his eyes. The Cursed Land wasn't just some place they could enter so easily, which was already obvious from what they had just seen earlier. Max, in Delroy's opinion, was spouting nonsense.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to tell him off, an idea suddenly popped in Woody's head, "Hey Luo Luo Zheng," he said, turning to the youth beside him. "You knew we wouldn't be able to enter this Cursed Land all along, didn't you? You were just randomly bragging about that title you've obtained.</p>

  <p>We'd be unable to verify it anyway."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes and sneered but didn't bother to argue.</p>

  <p>Max ignored this exchange and turned his attention to Hank. "Did you bring any puppets with you this time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes suddenly lit up with hope!</p>

  <p>"Puppets!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! Hank's puppets could work!"</p>

  <p>Not only was Hank proficient in all sorts of flying tools, he was also a master puppeteer. If they could take advantage of his puppets, they'd be able to get through the Cursed Land with no problems. They still wanted to take a look at the Tower of Crystal, Woody in particular since he really wanted to expose Luo Luo Zheng and his lies. The youth would have a lot of explaining to do if it turned out that his title wasn't on the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>However, Hank's next words would wipe away any hope they all had,</p>

  <p>"I? didn't bring any puppets with me?"</p>

  <p>Everyone's shoulders slumped at his reply. Their last sliver of hope was gone.</p>

  <p>"But it shouldn't be difficult for you to gather some materials around and make a few of them, right?" Max prodded.</p>

  <p>Hank nodded in affirmation. "Yes, that won't be a problem but the puppets won't be that powerful since the materials would come from the Lower World. I'm afraid I can't produce puppets that would be at the Soul Sea Realm."</p>

  <p>'Puppets at the Soul Sea Realm?'</p>

  <p>That meant Hank could produce puppets that were way stronger! Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but let out a sigh and finally understood why these Celestial Position warriors had been so arrogant. The disparity between the Lower World and Upper World was just too great.</p>

  <p>"That's fine! We don't need puppets to be that powerful. As long as they can help us cross the Cursed Land, they would do. We can just scrounge up some materials." Woody sneered, side-eyeing Luo Luo Zheng. He had wanted to see if he looked anxious or uneasy. Liars usually were nervous just before their lies were exposed. However, none of those emotions were traceable in Luo Zheng's features.</p>

  <p>Instead, he even stepped forward to volunteer, "I'm very familiar with a few races on the Sea God Continent. They might have the materials you need which will be easier for us than searching for them ourselves."</p>

  <p>"That's great!" Max smiled in relief.</p>

  <p>Once the discussion was done, everyone quickly returned to the Eight-diagram Wheel and headed straight towards the direction Luo Luo Zheng had indicated which would lead them to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent wasn't that big, especially since the Cursed Land occupied a huge chunk of its center. The areas surrounding the Cursed Land were actually even smaller than the Central Region, so it only took a few minutes for the Eight-diagram Wheel to arrive above the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>However, just as they arrived, a concerning sight came into Luo Zheng's view: a long column of smoke rose from the holy tree in the distance and massive waves of life vitality were spread out all over the land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes immediately widened, "A war?"</p>

  <p>How could the other races dare challenge the Demon Night with Amber guarding the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place?</p>

  <p>Back when he was in trouble, both the Purple Heart Sacred Place and Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had sent a number of war sages to his aid through the transmission array. Even Miguel and several other powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm from the Demon Night had personally come to the Central Region!</p>

  <p>They could freely leave their homes mostly because they knew Amber would be guarding both sacred places. She was the strongest and the most talented warrior on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>As long as she was there, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place would not dare act rashly.</p>

  <p>So what was this war happening in front of his very eyes? Did something happen to Amber?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression darkened and he jumped down from the Eight-diagram Wheel to rush towards the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh?"</p>

  <p>Numerous beams of light constantly flashed and collided in the sky - a clash between war sages!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze quickly swept over the scene and a trace of cold light appeared in his eyes, "It really is the ogres! The Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place... They actually dared to attack the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place!"</p>

  <p>Above him, two bright beams of light constantly repelled and intertwined. One was long and narrow, within which flowers constantly bloomed and flourished.</p>

  <p>'Esther?' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself, squinting to see clearer. Looking at the direction where the beam of white light flashed, Luo Luo Zheng found that it was indeed a woman and she was rapidly moving in the sky.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Esther was in a very sorry state. Her slender body was already full of injuries and there was a gaping wound on her waist that revealed the white bone underneath the bloody flesh. However, despite the pain and suffering, she visibly gritted her teeth and continued fighting off her opponent.</p>

  <p>It was none other than a fourth-level ogre war sage!</p>

  <p>As a top-level war lord, Esther had been the most powerful warrior in the Tower of Sin. When she left the tower, she had advanced into a first-level war sage and after taking advantage of the Lucky Light she had accumulated in the Tower of Sin, she had tried several times and finally advanced to a second-level war sage. However, despite her advancements, it was evident that she still found it difficult to deal with her fourth-level war sage ogre opponent.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! Just accept your fate and surrender Esther! You're a beautiful Demon Night woman. I don't want your looks to go to waste. I know you and I are of different races, but if you become my captive, I'll make you the happiest woman for the rest of your life!" Her opponent laughed hysterically, waving the fiery red saber in his hand. Bright red lights burst from the saber and headed straight for Esther's vital parts.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't just bear to stand by and watch. He quickly jumped up and rushed towards her.</p>

  <p>Esther's perception was extremely sharp and she was able to sense Luo Zheng's approach even as she tried to dodge the ogre's attacks. Thinking that it was another ogre that had come for her, Esther immediately swerved and launched a beam of light towards Luo Luo Zheng, attacking him with flowers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure flashed and quickly avoided the blooms. "Esther, it's me!"</p>

  <p>The sound of a familiar voice made her turn around in confusion.</p>

  <p>However, the moment she saw him, Esther's face immediately lit up with joy. She never thought Luo Luo Zheng would suddenly appear at such a critical moment!</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!" she called out with glee.</p>

  <p>The fourth-level ogre war sage who was chasing Esther also turned his head once he heard her mention Luo Zheng's name. He too, couldn't help but be stunned at his sudden arrival.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's name was whispered and spat like a curse in both the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place. It was this guy and this guy alone that had driven their entire race out of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>All of them knew this name despite never having seen him.</p>
