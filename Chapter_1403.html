<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Many of the palace leaders paid no attention to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The reason for this was quite simple.</p>

  <p>At present, Zheng was at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm. The sixth small Heavenly Tribulation was incomparable with the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation that Layla had to face.</p>

  <p>And so things proceeded with everyone's gazes fixated on her.</p>

  <p>As Javier started the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation, the warrior, with the surname Li, began to undergo the same trial. In addition to him, several other warriors started to experience their tribulations too.</p>

  <p>Across the sky spanned all kinds of the Heavenly Tribulations' powers.</p>

  <p>Voices escaped through the clouds like the beginnings of a tumultuous storm.</p>

  <p>Two hours had passed.</p>

  <p>Javier's small Heavenly Tribulation had finally come to an end. The Lotus Flower gently spun, its shadow gradually dissipating.</p>

  <p>An immaculate Soul Sea sprung in his body. In its perfection, he was now the epitome of a Soul Sea Realm warrior. As his cultivation base increased, the Soul Sea inside him would grant him greater power. It opened up endless possibilities— some of which could only be obtained with the help of the immaculate Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>Javier closed his eyes and reinforced his cultivation base...</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the small Heavenly Tribulations of Layla and Zheng had yet to arrive.</p>

  <p>The Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill couldn't guarantee the arrival of Heavenly Tribulations on all people. Layla felt the beginnings of her anxiousness grow as time stretched longer. Zheng, however, did not share this worry. It did not matter whether his sixth small Heavenly Tribulation came or not. After all, as his cultivation base increased, it would come sooner or later.</p>

  <p>To Layla, the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation was of utmost importance. She could not afford to let her chance pass.</p>

  <p>Another hour passed, and all the warriors who had taken the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill had passed through the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation. From among them, those who managed to reach the ninth level of the Life and Death Realm were all considered outstanding. The Heavenly Tribulations that they triggered were indeed tremendous, but they had come fully prepared— death was no danger.</p>

  <p>Two warriors had immediately fainted after passing through the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation. This failure was brought about by arrogance. They had underestimated the power of the Heavenly Tribulation and overused their strength.</p>

  <p>"It hasn't come yet.." Layla murmured, her voice edged with anxiety.</p>

  <p>She threw a tentative look at Zheng's direction. He looked calm, as if the prolonged waiting did nothing to agitate him in the slightest.</p>

  <p>It was right at this moment that a faint shadow appeared over Layla. It grew denser, until a Lotus Flower revealed itself.</p>

  <p>"It's here!" Layla exclaimed, a look of surprise crossing over her face.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a faint black dot started to appear in the sky. The black dot grew in size, forming a black hole that was several dozen feet large.</p>

  <p>Purple lightning flashed around it, and mysterious divine textures hovered in its surroundings. These divine textures came with no human intervention— they formed spontaneously, following the world's natural order.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Sacred Thunder Tribulation!" one of the palace leaders exclaimed, a ray of light shooting out from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"This woman... It comes as no surprise. With the level of her cultivation base, even the heavens would not be blind to her abilities!"</p>

  <p>The palace leader's conjecture was accurate. Layla's cultivation defied the heavens. A warrior's Heavenly Tribulation matched his or her own strength. The stronger a warrior was, the more intense the tribulation would be.</p>

  <p>The other warriors from the thirteen palaces watched in awe as the Heavenly Sacred Thunder Tribulation descended. It was a terrible sight.</p>

  <p>Some of them could not help but worry for the fate of the woman who was to face it. With such a powerful Heavenly Tribulation, it would be possible for her to be destroyed into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Boom..." The sound of thunder permeated through the space.</p>

  <p>The tenth small Heavenly Tribulation was truly overwhelming, but Layla's own strength would not pale in comparison.</p>

  <p>Her techniques were endless. From the Enchanted Barrier Tower to the Illusion Space, she had displayed incredible mastery of different skills.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she possessed sharp and precise judgment. It was as if all her methods were both calculated and instinctive— she performed them naturally, but with deadly accuracy. The sight of her in battle was quite a sight.</p>

  <p>As Layla went through the Heavenly Sacred Thunder Tribulation, several more tribulations followed suit. One by one, the Invisible Fire, the Washing Nightmare, and others arrived.</p>

  <p>These small Heavenly Tribulations were the greatest ones among all.</p>

  <p>Even the palace leaders who knew the power of Heavenly Tribulations best were shocked at their appearance.</p>

  <p>A single small Heavenly Tribulation would bring about several others, the difficulty and power of such tribulations increasing gradually. These tribulations that Layla underwent were definitely regarded as the strongest ones among all the warriors'. She would have to face them one by one, each one more terrifying than the last.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Layla felt her strength draining from her body. She was flying in the air, fighting against the descending tribulations with all her power.</p>

  <p>After what had seemed to be an endless stretch of time, the Heavenly Tribulations finally dispersed.</p>

  <p>Layla's shoulders heaved with every breath. She descended to the ground and sat down cross-legged. Despite her fatigue, a small, victorious smile was on her lips. She had successfully passed through the tenth Heavenly Tribulation. Never had she come face to face with a greater power than this.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched with bated breath as the Lotus Flower above her head began to spin.</p>

  <p>Under ordinary circumstances, the shadow of the Lotus Flower would become increasingly faint after the Heavenly Tribulation until it completely vanished.</p>

  <p>But now, not only did the Lotus Flower above Layla's head not disappear, it had even become more and more solid.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, even the lord of the Sunset World's eyes widened, his face revealing his shock. "This is ..."</p>

  <p>Yolande threw him a quick glance. "The Mahayana Lotus Flower..." she finished.</p>

  <p>"Incredible! If it's her, then it's possible. To think that she can activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower even when she is still just breaking through to reach the Soul Sea Realm! This..." A myriad of emotions crossed the palace leader's face. He could not believe his own eyes.</p>

  <p>Even the most knowledgeable and experienced palace leaders found it difficult to maintain their composure at the sudden turn of events.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower were an extreme rarity, but what was even more unbelievable was that Layla activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower when she had just reached the Soul Sea Realm. The implications were both exhilarating and terrifying.</p>

  <p>As she became stronger, she was bound to be an outstanding master, surpassing even the heavens.</p>

  <p>The warriors of thirteen palaces stood petrified at the revelation.</p>

  <p>To be able to participate in the Passing the Torch, one must be among the elites of the thirteen palaces. There were countless of them from sacred places, gathered in the thirteen palaces— all of them in possession of great talent. All of them had at the very least activated the Five-petal Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>However, summoning the Mahayana Lotus Flower was almost inconceivable. And yet, here was Layla, about to activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower right in front of their very eyes.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower above her continued spinning, and an even larger Lotus Flower appeared above it. The second flower had even more petals.</p>

  <p>The Hinayana Lotus Flower had a total of nine petals, and the Mahayana Lotus Flower had a total of twenty-seven.</p>

  <p>When the Mahayana Lotus Flower appeared, the first lotus petal on it slowly unfolded. It was followed by a second, a third, fourth, and fifth...</p>

  <p>Layla raised her head to look at the lotus that was constantly blooming.</p>

  <p>Her tired face brightened with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Five lotus petals bloomed. With the addition of the Hinayana Lotus Flower's nine petals, there were a total of fourteen petals.</p>

  <p>After five petals opened, the Mahayana Lotus flower began to fade and after some moments disappeared.</p>

  <p>The palace leaders looked at Layla with conflicted expressions. The Passing the Torch was arranged to test the junior warriors of thirteen palaces, but the abilities that Layla had displayed were something that sparked the envy of even the palace leaders themselves.</p>

  <p>When Layla's Lotus Flower had disappeared, Layla glanced at Zheng and smiled meaningfully.</p>

  <p>Back in the Enchanted Barrier Tower, he had bested her due to the fact that she had come out in advance.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng had lost to Layla's brother in the Illusion Space. She was able to win over him only because her brother was too strong. If it was her skill against his, Zheng did not fall much farther behind her. This closeness in their strengths irked her. She had wanted to put a gap between them and establish herself as undoubtedly the better warrior.</p>

  <p>Layla smiled in satisfaction. With her results this time, how could Zheng match up to her now?</p>

  <p>Zheng was no fool. He understood instantly what was in Layla's mind.</p>

  <p>However, he remained unbothered.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he cared more about his sixth small Heavenly Tribulation. He waited, wondering why it still hadn't arrived.</p>
