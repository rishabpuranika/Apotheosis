<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>This time, Nicholas was determined to gain control of the entire Abyss Demon Region. He had already gathered so many Holy Beings and consummate True Gods for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Inviting the Han Clan was already unnecessary considering the clan's ambiguous attitude and stand in the whole matter.</p>

  <p>Liusu floated to the front of a high platform and stared at Jeremiah.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Jeremiah, it was my fault for destroying the engagement, but to be honest, Langston's talent is too poor and he isn't really a good match for me!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she quickly retreated and flew towards the consummate True Gods below. She held onto the arm of one of them and leaned into his shoulder. She looked up at Jeremiah and gave him a smile. "Uncle Jeremiah, don't you think this consummate True God and I are well-matched?"</p>

  <p>This consummate True God was Cedric Leng and was also Jeremiah's most excellent son.</p>

  <p>Cedric couldn't help but freeze when Liusu leaned onto his shoulder.</p>

  <p>It was extremely rare for a girl to become a consummate True God, even among the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. When Joy and Estelle broke through and became consummate True Gods, they had a lot of trouble fending off countless pursuers who professed their love for them.</p>

  <p>Later on, Rachelle also reached the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>However, it was already well-known that Rachelle was very ambitious.</p>

  <p>She had no intention of finding a man and showed disdain for married life.</p>

  <p>Liusu, on the other hand, was both beautiful and elegant enough to make people fall in love with her at first sight.</p>

  <p>Her curly hair smelled so good and Cedric couldn't help but feel an immediate attraction towards her.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah was quite surprised at Liusu's actions. "I have said that if the Leng Clan and the Han Clan were to forge an alliance, then the best way to do it was through marriage. I was willing to go for such an arrangement before but the current circumstances are not ideal for a wedding right now. We are slated to go to the Abyss Demon Region in half a month and I don't think we'll have enough time."</p>

  <p>Samuel and Jeremiah had made an agreement for Liusu and Langston's marriage in order to forge an alliance between their clans.</p>

  <p>With this marriage, the Han Clan would automatically join the alliance of the powerful clans as per the rules.</p>

  <p>The Liu Clan and Xie Clan also made use of this strategy in order to join the alliance in the past.</p>

  <p>"Since we don't have the time, we can discuss the marriage first. It can be held after our return from the Abyss Demon Region. What do you think, Jeremiah?" Samuel asked.</p>

  <p>Many of the consummate True Gods showed a trace of contempt upon hearing Samuel's words.</p>

  <p>Samuel would let his daughter marry some random man just so he could enter the Abyss Demon Region. Such a way of doing things was disgusting.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah retained his polite smile. "I don't care so long as you keep your promise. However, whether your clan can join the alliance or not depends entirely on Nicholas..."</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Nicholas was the leader of the alliance of the powerful clans and the decision of accepting the Han Clan or not lay in his hands.</p>

  <p>Nicholas simply looked at Samuel indifferently.</p>

  <p>When the Han Clan entered the Time Sea, they immediately made a lot of achievements.</p>

  <p>At that time, Nicholas tried to build a good relationship with Samuel in order to convince him to join the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel refused his invitation with no second glances. He wasn't someone who was willing to condescend to others.</p>

  <p>Ever since then, Nicholas tried his best to suppress the Han Clan though he did not necessarily do anything cruel to them.</p>

  <p>In the last few decades though, Samuel's attitude considerably changed which made Nicholas doubtful and wary. His wariness caused him to hesitate in allowing the Han Clan to join the alliance of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be a long journey for us this time. If the Han Clan can make a contribution to our alliance, then it wouldn't be too bad,"</p>

  <p>Nicholas said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Samuel practically beamed and cupped his hands towards Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Our Han Clan will wholeheartedly devote ourselves to the alliance."</p>

  <p>What he said made the consummate True Gods despise him even more.</p>

  <p>Different clans had different levels of power. It was just a fact that some clans were stronger than the others, in the end though, all of them were still equal. Even Nicholas, who was the leader of the alliance, held no superiority over the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Samuel saying that they would devote themselves wholeheartedly to the alliance was only because he wanted to be overly flattering.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Samuel," Clark said. "Your elder daughter's marriage has been arranged but your younger daughter has also reached the age of marriage. Why not consider my son as an in-law?"</p>

  <p>The one Clark referring to was Walton.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, Walton had withstood a punch from Luo Zheng. Most of his power had gotten dissolved into the ground and he sustained several serious injuries.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he gradually recovered after being treated for a long time.</p>

  <p>Hearing his father's words, Walton quickly cast a glance at Aleyna from the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>She was only a young girl ten years ago but had now grown up to become quite a beautiful lady. Her charm differed from that of Liusu since Aleyna seemed to have a sweet, lively personality.</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes flashed upon hearing Clark's sudden request. "That would be up to my daughter," he said with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"I agree," Aleyna responded indifferently as soon as Samuel finished speaking.</p>

  <p>She didn't even look at Walton. It was as if this marriage had nothing to do with her.</p>

  <p>This attitude of her made Clark quite suspicious. However, he kept it to himself in the meantime.</p>

  <p>"We can discuss it after we return from the Abyss Demon Region. What do you think, Clark?" Samuel asked.</p>

  <p>"That's great!" Clark agreed with a smile. He'd take this time to observe things before they formalized anything.</p>

  <p>Tianming returned to his residence after leaving Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>He lived in a small, separate, white jade palace which was a luxury since most True Gods were eager to have such a place on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>He opened the door and was suddenly greeted by a tight hug from behind him. A woman in plain clothes had rushed over and held him tightly.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Iris?" he asked, gently stroking the woman's arms which wrapped around his waist.</p>

  <p>"Can I go with you?" Iris asked.</p>

  <p>Her soft voice stunned Tianming but a trace of determination appeared in his eyes. "Iris, you remember our rule."</p>

  <p>Iris was not allowed to interfere with his affairs.</p>

  <p>She had kept this promise for years. After entering the Floating Island, Iris would merely stay in the palace and did not go anywhere.</p>

  <p>No one exactly knew where Tianming went and what he did, much less Iris.</p>

  <p>After a moment's silence, a trace of sadness appeared on the young woman's face.</p>

  <p>"Don't be willful," Tianming said, getting her arms off him before turning around with a smile.</p>

  <p>Iris stared at him and shook her head. "But you promised me that you would take me with you forever. I'm scared that you might not return this time!"</p>

  <p>"How come?" Tianming asked with a laugh, rubbing Iris's nose.</p>

  <p>However, there was no hint of humor on her face. She trusted her gut feeling on this matter very much. "Even if I know you will do something bad to our Dongfang Clan, I don't care. You can't leave me alone!"</p>

  <p>Tianming's heart skipped a beat and a trace of panic appeared on his originally calm face.</p>
