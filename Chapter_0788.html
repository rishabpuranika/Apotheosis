<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 788 Calamity </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now, it was the Holy Maiden's turn to roll the dice again.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden blinked her eyes and the dice once again began rolling in the air.</p>

  <p>There was dead silence in the air as the dice rolled, changing the numbers and then finally stopping with six dots on top. The Holy Maiden smiled profoundly and stepped forward as she said, "Six again!" Then six round discs appeared on by one in the air and the sixth one emitted a faint yellow light.</p>

  <p>"Throw the dice again!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden glanced at Ning Yudie with a scornful smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie stood on top of a disc; her expressionless eyes met the Holy Maiden's. No one could see through her poker face.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the dice in the center of the chasm rolled again, and there was dead silence once more. The dice began slowing down until it finally stopped rolling displaying the five dots.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden's face darkened as the number "five" unveiled before her eyes. There was no way that her luck could be inferior to that woman in the Central Region. She wouldn't accept it.</p>

  <p>The transparent round discs appeared one after another in front of the Holy Maiden. As the fifth disc appeared, it began to emit a brown light.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden didn't like the color. What was more, there could be a punishment hidden within it.</p>

  <p>If it was up to her, she wouldn't step on it. However, she had no choice but to do it. Despite her reluctance, she still stepped on it.</p>

  <p>"Calamity! You can release a calamity on another player and reduce the person's luck for a short period of time," a faint voice sounded in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>"Oh? That means I can reduce someone else's luck?" The Holy Maiden's eyes slightly narrowed as she gazed on Ning Yudie. She looked determined and a sly smile crossed her face.</p>

  <p>The people from the divine kingdom knew that this was a test of luck. No matter how strong and powerful one could be, without luck on his side, he would surely fail the test. If one was lucky enough to pass this test, he would gain great opportunities ahead of him.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter what motives or plots Immortal Mist had, or how powerful his methods were. After experiencing the Five Aging Processes? Filthy Clothing, Falling Hair, Sweating Armpit, Stinky Body, and Restless Mind? he would surely have no chance of reviving at all.</p>

  <p>This was the law of life. Even an existence more powerful than immortals wouldn't be able to bring someone back to life.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only Luo Luo Zheng who guessed that there was some problem with the celestial tomb. Everyone else did. However, these people still decided to explore the celestial tomb despite the horrors that might await them.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden and her companions also had the same thoughts as everyone else. Perhaps they even knew some secrets that no one else knew.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden smiled coldly and pointed at Ning Yudie as she said, "Let's see what she can do now! Time to reduce her luck!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng heard this, he was suddenly filled with rage. He didn't stop himself from saying, "Don't you dare!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden giggled. "But I will! Don't think you can threaten me, you little rat!"</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As the Holy Maiden finished her command, a small black cloud appeared right above Ning Yudie. There was also black lightning appearing from the small black cloud.</p>

  <p>In this turn, the black cloud's purpose was to reduce Yudie's luck, therefore it could not harm her just yet. But Ning Yudie knew that if she was to throw the dice in the next round, her luck would eventually run out and she could get into trouble.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pursed her lips helplessly and looked at Luo Luo Zheng for help. If meeting the Holy Maiden wasn't already her bad luck, she didn't know what else could be.</p>

  <p>"It's fine! It's a part of the game so there must be a way to fix it," Luo Luo Zheng consoled.</p>

  <p>It was the best he could do for now. When Ning Yudie was not looking, Luo Luo Zheng frowned and turned his gaze back at the Holy Maiden. Ning Yudie hadn't provoked her. The only reason why the Holy Maiden had decided to reduce Yudie's luck was that the latter was advancing too fast and even surpassing her.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had already gained a life span of 500 years in the first round and advanced sixty steps in the second round. With her pace, no one could match her luck.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought for a moment and asked the cyan dragon in his mind, "Dude, is it so easy to affect someone's luck?"</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw!" The cyan dragon laughed. "Of course not! One's luck is predestined. If it could be affected so easily, then Immortal Mist would change his luck and live longer instead of encountering the Five Aging Processes."</p>

  <p>"Then why did it affect Yudie's luck?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"One's luck is definitely not something an immortal can change. And Ning Yudie is a special girl. She is favored by destiny. So, you can think that her luck could not be easily affected and reduced. However, there is a way to make Ning Yudie suffer inside this Wheel of Fortune," the cyan dragon suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"How?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"It's actually very simple. Luck can affect the outcome of the dice, the number of steps you take and whether you will encounter fortune or misfortune. But after the Holy Maiden used the calamity on Ning Yudie, every step Ning Yudie takes in the next six steps will be a punishment. No matter how lucky Ning Yudie is and what number the dice rolls, she will step on 'punishment, ' because every step will be a punishment!"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon analyzed calmly and then continued, "Actually, this did not affect Yudie's luck. The immortal cannot change other people's luck, but he did change the rules of the game, making Ning Yudie look 'unlucky.' But her luck is still strong, so she will definitely encounter the lightest 'punishment' among the six punishments."</p>

  <p>"Yudie's luck is that strong?" Luo Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>"Yes! But her luck is slightly weaker than yours," the cyan dragon replied.</p>

  <p>"Is my luck really that good?" A look of dejection flashed across Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He didn't believe that his luck was that good. If it was, he would have taken more than three steps forward.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon chuckled, but didn't answer Luo Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>In the cyan dragon's eyes, Luo Luo Zheng had the fate to lead the world of chaos. No one's luck was better than his.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a new round of dice began rolling.</p>

  <p>At this moment, it was like the microcosm of the fate of all the people present.</p>

  <p>Some people with extremely good luck still ended in death after stepping on equally extreme punishment.</p>

  <p>There were also some people with rough fates that survived the endless trials and tribulations, and they eventually obtained rich rewards.</p>

  <p>However, the fate of these people was neither too good nor too bad. It was the kind of luck that belonged to normal people.</p>

  <p>As for the two top warriors of the Central Region, Eddie and Simon, their luck was not that constantly good. But because of their incredible strength, they were able to survive a series of punishments.</p>

  <p>It was now Luo Zheng's turn to roll the dice. As he rolled the dice for the third time, it unveiled the five dots. Afterward, a brown disk appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat when he saw the brown disc appear. He quickly walked onto it and the voice rang in everyone's ears again, "You can release a calamity on another player and reduce this person's luck for a short period of time."</p>

  <p>'Damn right! My luck is not that bad after all, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Eddie's forehead wrinkled. Seeing that Luo Zheng's eyes were fixed on him, he began to feel nervous.</p>

  <p>"You are very strong. Even if I bring you bad luck, you'll still be able to survive," Luo Luo Zheng said coldly.</p>

  <p>Eddie sneered, "It's good to know that you recognize my strength. I'm flattered."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then quickly turned his gaze onto the Holy Maiden. She got nervous as she locked eyes with Luo Luo Zheng, her chest heaving up and down. She said in a crisp voice, "If you dare to use calamity on me, I will wipe out the whole Sky Northern Region one day!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes. "If you could do that, you would've done it long ago.</p>

  <p>Who would you fool with such a useless threat?"</p>

  <p>"Brat, don't use it on her. I will give you things more precious than you can get in this celestial tomb!" coaxed the handsome man that was with the Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously think I'm that stupid? Or maybe you are stupid for thinking that I would fall for that." Luo Luo Zheng pointed to his brain and laughed. "If you really think there are more precious things than what you can get in this celestial tomb, then why are you here yourselves?"</p>

  <p>The man's face darkened. He then answered, "Friend, you seem not to know who we are. What I am offering you is anyone's dream! You better make the right decision now or you'll regret it!"</p>

  <p>The other cultivators at the Life and Death Realm of the divine kingdom were also coldly staring at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This is the Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom. So are you a prince of the divine kingdom. But it doesn't matter to me! Use the calamity on her!" Luo Luo Zheng pointed to the Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A small black cloud with black lightning suddenly appeared above the Holy Maiden's head.</p>

  <p>She was having a taste of her own medicine. It was like karma had worked its way to her after what she did to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Looking at the dark cloud above her head, the Holy Maiden screamed sternly, "Elders! Kill him!"</p>

  <p>The five elders at the Life and Death Realm behind her all took out their weapons at the same time. The Holy Maiden's anger was not something to be taken lightly.</p>

  <p>However, Elder Gong, who was closest to the Holy Maiden, said helplessly,</p>

  <p>"Miss, we can't break the enchanted barrier set up by Immortal Mist. Now is not the right time to kill him!"</p>

  <p>"I don't care!" the Holy Maiden said. She was the Holy Maiden of a certain great clan, and no one had dared to disrespect her before.</p>

  <p>She was used to people buttering her up and this was the first time that someone had dared to offend her. So, she wouldn't listen to Elder Gong despite knowing for herself that the elder could be probably right. First, someone had dared to use calamity on her. Then now, one of her elders had dared to persuade her to back off. She couldn't swallow her pride in front of her people.</p>

  <p>The handsome man coaxed, "Let's not be reckless. If I get a free challenge, I will help you kill him!"</p>
