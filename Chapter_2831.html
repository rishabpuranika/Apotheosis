<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Staring at Nicholas, who was standing from a distance, Tianming murmured,</p>

  <p>"With Nicholas' cunning personality, he must have figured out a way to prevent us from escaping now that he performed this theurgy."</p>

  <p>"We can't just stay still and wait for death to come," said Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Looking up in the sky, Zheng noticed some changes on the eight-diagram disc.</p>

  <p>He observed it for a while before saying, "The eight-diagram disc is becoming smaller."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, everyone looked up at the same direction.</p>

  <p>Like a millstone, the huge eight-diagram disc still kept spinning, pulling everyone to have them rotate around Nicholas.</p>

  <p>If it continued, they would eventually be pulled into the center of the vortex.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a blazing light appeared from the other side of the huge vortex, spreading out an extremely strong wave of space.</p>

  <p>Even at a long distance, everyone felt the strong fluctuation of space.</p>

  <p>After the light gradually dimmed, Samuel appeared from out of the blue.</p>

  <p>His hand was trembling, as he held onto the Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>His face was ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>Even though he had hit the barrier of the vortex with all his might, Samuel still couldn't break it.</p>

  <p>The woman initially planned to have Samuel's clone to try it out. But having seen this, she couldn't help shaking her head. It would be useless and a waste of energy.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Samuel, do you think you can escape? Dream on!" Nicholas sneered, laughing hysterically.</p>

  <p>Raising his hands in the air, he controlled the eight-diagram disc, speeding up its spin as the vortex' border shrank rapidly.</p>

  <p>All members of the alliance of powerful clans, as well as Samuel, Zheng and the rest tried hard to press themselves against the barrier. But no matter how hard they tried to escape, they were like small boats drawn to the center of the huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>The huge vortex, which was originally hundreds of miles wide, shrunk by half in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now? Are we really going to die here today?"</p>

  <p>"Holy Nicholas, aren't we all members of the alliance? For the sake of our cooperation, please spare our lives!"</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, we followed you obediently, but you want to sacrifice us? You don't deserve to be the head of the alliance!"</p>

  <p>Most people who were members of the alliance were overwhelmed by despair.</p>

  <p>They had followed Nicholas to the Abyss Demon Region hoping it would be beneficial to them, only to find out that he was leading them to their deaths. How could they accept such a cruel faith?</p>

  <p>Despite the cries of the people, Nicholas' face remained expressionless as he turned a deaf ear to them.</p>

  <p>He had always been incredibly famed and feared for his power. Now that he had sacrificed even himself, showing sympathy for these insignificant figures was the least of his concerns.</p>

  <p>As Nicholas controlled the eight-diagram disc even harder, the huge vortex shrank faster.</p>

  <p>Soon, its width shrank to a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Eighty miles...</p>

  <p>Fifty miles...</p>

  <p>Everyone became terrified as they ended up confined on a narrow space, spinning at a very high speed.</p>

  <p>Although they initially fought against each other, they decided to disregard their differences. Right now, all they were thinking about was escaping from the Furnace of Dark and Light.</p>

  <p>But if Samuel and the others had no way to escape, how would an ordinary Holy Being or Demi-holy Being be able to?</p>

  <p>Still focused on the eight-diagram disc above them, Zheng finally saw a glimmer of hope. Making sure that everyone would hear, he announced loudly, "We can't just sit still and wait for our death! If I'm not wrong, the eight-diagram disc above us is actually a huge magic array. We'll need to attack it with all our might. If we can destroy this array, I believe that the Furnace of Dark and Light will fall apart immediately!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's conclusion, everyone's eyes lit up with hope.</p>

  <p>No one was sure if they would be able to destroy the eight-diagram disc, but it was worth a try.</p>

  <p>"He's right! If we all work together, we'll find a way out of this mess."</p>

  <p>Samuel raised an eyebrow, a smile escaping from his lips.</p>

  <p>Zheng paid him an indifferent glance but said nothing in reply. Turning his hand over, a new long sword appeared on it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the Ways-blending Energy burst out from his body, numerous red lotuses started to grow around him.</p>

  <p>The woman, Samuel's clone, Tianming and Sword Chen began to prepare their strongest attacks.</p>

  <p>Samuel also followed their suit.</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of the powerful clans didn't give Zheng a clear response. After all, they still had some scruples about Nicholas. However, they also made sure that they were ready to launch an attack.</p>

  <p>Even Rachelle's eyes were flashing with visible killing intent. The short swords in each of her hands shone brightly with red light. Never did she expect that she would end up fighting on the same side as Zheng.</p>

  <p>But seeing that Nicholas didn't care about their safety, she didn't feel guilty about betraying him.</p>

  <p>"Attack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted, raising his long sword.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>A broad sword radiance shot out from it, heading straight for the eight-diagram disc.</p>

  <p>The rest also followed seeing him starting an attack.</p>

  <p>In order to escape and survive, they all went all out at the moment.</p>

  <p>Sword radiance, blade radiance, palm strikes, flames, and lightning... All these attacks shot straight up into the sky, making gales.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>There were less than thirty survivors from the union of the powerful clans, three of which were Holy Beings and more than ten were Demi-holy Beings. When they exerted their strengths to the utmost, their joint power was earth-shattering, that even the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos from the eight-diagram disc seemed to pale in comparison.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked up, focusing their eyes on the sky as their powers ran their course towards the eight-diagram disc.</p>

  <p>The first attack to reach it was the sword radiance from Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>However, like a little stone thrown into a great lake, the sword radiance only created a few ripples, before disappearing into the spinning eight-diagram disc.</p>

  <p>"It didn't work." Zheng felt his heart sink in despair.</p>

  <p>The others who were watching also revealed their disappointment.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, a small crack suddenly appeared on the surface of the eight-diagram disc and quickly spread to its center.</p>

  <p>During that time, the attacks launched by the other people also reached the eight-diagram disc, expanding the damage and increasing the cracks on the disc.</p>

  <p>"Did we make it?" one asked, seeing the cracks spreading.</p>

  <p>"It worked!" another giggled.</p>

  <p>"The Furnace of Dark and Light is actually fragile!"</p>

  <p>Their eyes lit up with hope and excitement.</p>

  <p>Someone consumed pills, burnt their blood essence, and others even activated secret techniques. They launched the second round of attacks simultaneously.</p>

  <p>With their joint attacks, the cracks on the eight-diagram disc became wider.</p>

  <p>Just as the cracks were about to spread to the edge of the eight-diagram disc, Nicholas suddenly sneered and said, "Ha-ha! How naive are you all!"</p>

  <p>After that, the Dark and Light energies on the surface of the eight-diagram disc started to fuse together, mending the cracks quickly until they disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>Everyone below were stunned and stopped their attacks in despair. They thought they finally found a way out, but it was just a misconception.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt desperate.</p>

  <p>"It's no use."</p>

  <p>"The Furnace of Dark and Light is a perfect combination of Dark and Light energies. It would be impossible for us to break it."</p>

  <p>With all their hope gone, a deeper sense of despair overwhelmed them.</p>

  <p>Just then, the scope of the huge vortex shrank again, making it less than ten miles wide now.</p>
