  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not concerned about everything that was happening now. Both Patrick and Lewis were healing their wounds at that moment, so Luo Luo Zheng decided not to disturb them. So instead, he walked up to Morphens and asked, "How's she?"</p>

  <p>Morphens nodded at Luo Luo Zheng and knew why he was worried. "She's fine,"</p>

  <p>Morphens answered.</p>

  <p>"Don't lie to me. If she's okay, why would those guys dare to act so boldly?" Luo Luo Zheng questioned, his face doubtful of the answer he just got.</p>

  <p>If Ning Yudie was actually fine, Emanuel wouldn't dare to do this no matter what his motivations were. Luo Luo Zheng was afraid that something wrong must have happened to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>It was only when he saw Luo Zheng's expression on his face that Morphens realized that Luo Luo Zheng had misunderstood the situation. He quickly said, "She is experiencing a life-and-death tribulation, that's why these people were taking advantage of her!"</p>

  <p>"A life-and-death tribulation?" Luo Luo Zheng looked shocked as he asked, "What about Lady Yu?" Suddenly, at that moment, all Luo Luo Zheng wanted to know was what Imogen was doing.</p>

  <p>Even though Ning Yudie was trying to break into the Life and Death Realm, Emanuel wouldn't do anything bold or rebellious if Imogen was there, guarding the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"She is out, seeking her own luck," Morphens replied lightly. Actually, Emanuel had tried to talk Ning Yudie out of her decision about breaking into the Life and Death Realm at that moment. It would be difficult for Cloud Hall to deal with any possible threat or trouble if neither Ning Yudie nor Imogen was there.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie insisted on making a breakthrough at such a critical moment. Heavenly Evil Sect was becoming stronger every day. If she was able to successfully enter the Life and Death Realm, she might get herself a chance to fight against Eddie.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie never expected Emanuel's rebellion. If Luo Luo Zheng hadn't appeared at the right time, Emanuel might have already, with his people, broken into the Ice Palace and threatened Yudie's safety.</p>

  <p>"I must go inside and check on her," Luo Luo Zheng said, looking concerned and worried. Although he had never experienced the life and death tribulation before, he had been told that this experience was extremely dangerous and that the death rate was high. Those lesser warriors who rushed to get to the life and death tribulation had a high probability of dying there.</p>

  <p>"But Luo Luo Zheng... Miss Ning has specifically ordered that no one could enter the Ice Palace at this moment," Morphens replied seriously.</p>

  <p>As a response Luo Luo Zheng simply looked at Morphens and then slowly shook his head. Without looking back, he walked straight towards the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Morphens was about to pull Luo Luo Zheng back but as he looked at Luo Zheng's disappearing figure, he began to hesitate. If Luo Luo Zheng hadn't come to Yudie's rescue, Emanuel must have already broken into the Ice Palace and put Yudie's life in danger. Luo Luo Zheng had earned his right to come inside and check on Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Dense icy mist had permeated every corner of the Ice Palace. Luo Luo Zheng could barely see anything as he pushed open the doors leading to the inner part of the structure. He then used his magical eyes to see things that were not far away from him.</p>

  <p>Wearing some light clothes, Ning Yudie was just sitting there cross-legged, with her whole body frozen inside an icy column.</p>

  <p>It had been two years since they last saw each other.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, with great affection, stared at Ning Yudie. As he did so, he noticed that in the two years that they hadn't seen each other, Ning Yudie hadn't changed at all, and her face was still perfect and beautiful.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng circled around the icy column. At that time, Xun came out of Luo Zheng's body quietly, glanced at Ning Yudie and whispered, "She's at the last stage. If she passes it, the life-and-death tribulation will surely descend on her."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at Xun and asked out of curiosity, "What exactly is this life-and-death tribulation? Is it really as horrifying as the rumors say?"</p>

  <p>"Actually, only you warriors from the Central Region call it the life-and-death tribulation. In the Upper World, it's called Small Heavenly Tribulation," Xun explained.</p>

  <p>"Small Heavenly Tribulation?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, now looking more confused.</p>

  <p>"That's right. After entering the Life and Death Realm, warriors have to resist the Small Heavenly Tribulation, because their martial arts refinement is against the Nature. They try to break through the human limits and make their bodies into supreme beings, which is normally prohibited by the Nature. Those warriors have to take their punishments before they can go further. The stronger you are, the heavier the punishments you will face. That's where Small Heavenly Tribulation and Big Heavenly Tribulation differ," Xun said slowly.</p>

  <p>"After entering the Life and Death Realm, the life-and-death tribulation you meet every time is a Small Heavenly Tribulation, is that right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Xun replied, as she glanced at Ning Yudie. With a deep breath, she shook her head and added, "The Small Heavenly Tribulation which will descend on Yudie's body will be horrifying, I'm afraid," said Xun sadly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked nervously, his face starting to get pale.</p>

  <p>If somebody else was waiting for the Small Heavenly Tribulation to descend on his or her body, Xun would definitely mock his or her over-confidence and stupidity.</p>

  <p>However, Xun knew Luo Luo Zheng so well, and he was actually most concerned about Ning Yudie. So, she didn't dare mock Yudie's zeal and determination in front of Luo Luo Zheng. She thought for a moment and picked her words carefully. "Yudie's cultivation method is largely based on restarting and practicing anew, which is greatly against the Nature. If she succeeds in this, her strength and power will be much stronger than her peers at the same level."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, "The Sutra of Empyrean Goddess that she's cultivating truly is much stronger. Regular warriors usually find it nearly impossible to start with."</p>

  <p>"It's more than what you just said," said Xun, once again shaking her head. "You know, there have only been a few warriors in the Upper World who dared to restart their cultivation and practice anew mainly because it will bring a much more severe Heavenly Tribulation. Because of that, most warriors prefer other cultivation methods."</p>

  <p>Xun's words confused Luo Luo Zheng. Back then, the cyan dragon had found the unique nature of the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess. However, he chose to keep those facts from Luo Luo Zheng. Luo Luo Zheng then said to the cyan dragon, "You didn't mention those things back then."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon thought for a few moments and answered, "I know how to offset the negative results of Ning Yudie practicing anew nine times. But..."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon stumbled over his words.</p>

  <p>"She's already attempting the Life and Death Realm. You saying this does not mean anything now," Xun interrupted the cyan dragon, sneering.</p>

  <p>"Young lady, I know what you're saying. But, I think Luo Luo Zheng may be able to help Ning Yudie."</p>

  <p>"How can I do that?" Luo Luo Zheng said quickly. He wasn't understanding anything, but he would do whatever it took to help Ning Yudie. "Also, how come I don't know any of these things?" Luo Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>Both the cyan dragon and Xun shut their mouths up. An awkward silence then sank in. Xun sighed and said, "Although the Small Heavenly Tribulation is horrifying, I believe in Yudie's strength. She isn't like those regular warriors and she may actually find a way to successfully resist the Small Heavenly Tribulation. But if she fails,"</p>

  <p>Xun paused, looking directly at Luo Luo Zheng. "I'll tell you how to come to her rescue."</p>

  <p>Xun's words and the cyan dragon's silence convinced Luo Luo Zheng that he should have faith in Ning Yudie. It wasn't the first time that Xun and the cyan dragon behaved so strangely and cautiously. Luo Luo Zheng had already gotten used to them and their behaviors. And with that, he decided to ask no more questions.</p>

  <p>Standing amidst the icy mist, Luo Luo Zheng accompanied Ning Yudie for a whole day.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie didn't move a bit, and no communication happened between the two of them.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, cracks appeared and started spreading on the enormous icy column. Within a few moments, the icy column broke and its fragments exploded in the whole room.</p>

  <p>After the icy column was completely obliterated, the sky outside the Icy Palace became bright, a dazzling light illuminating everything beneath.</p>

  <p>Then, deafening thunders were heard, and black clouds gathered overhead.</p>

  <p>"So, is the Small Heavenly Tribulation coming?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, looking outside. The emergence of the thunder surprised him greatly.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded and replied, "Yes, this is one of the many anomalies before the Small Heavenly Tribulation descends."</p>

  <p>"If the Small Heavenly Tribulation is so horrifying, what about the big one?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, as what was happening outside continued to intimidate and scare him.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled and replied, "A strong warrior can endure nine Small Heavenly Tribulations, each one more terrifying than the last one. After this, warriors who get into the Soul Sea Realm have to confront the Big Heavenly Tribulations. As for their power," Xun also started looking out and whispered. "It's unimaginable."</p>

  <p>The Big Heavenly Tribulation was still far away from Luo Luo Zheng, but the smaller one was approaching. As long as Luo Luo Zheng continued to raise his cultivation and enter the top-level Virtual Tribulation Realm, he would face the Small Heavenly Tribulation soon.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>At that moment, a dragon-shaped bolt of lightning struck the roof of the Ice Palace!</p>

  <p>The Ice Palace had been built like a fortress, and its top floor was covered with thick ice spikes. However, the lightning, with its great force, was able to cause a large hole. Stones, ice cubes, and broken beams fell down.</p>

  <p>Luckily, those things didn't hurt Ning Yudie at all. Her eyes stayed closed, and cold air was suddenly coming out of her body. It was only moments away until the Small Heavenly Tribulation would fall on her body.</p>

  <p>With her full attention to the incoming ordeal, she wasn't able to notice the presence of Luo Luo Zheng in the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Through the large hole in the ceiling, Luo Luo Zheng cautiously stared at the dragons in the sky created by the lightning. With a deep breath he asked,</p>

  <p>"How can these dragons go through the enchanted barrier?"</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier called Light of Water was set outside of the Cloud Hall. However, it seemed to be incapable of stopping the electric dragons from coming into the palace.</p>
