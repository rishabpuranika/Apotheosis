  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once Kenneth descended from the sky, others who were floating in the air also slowly landed. All the elders from Cloud Sect were present, including Elder Xu, who rarely made a public appearance.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu was highly skilled at using cultivation methods related to life.</p>

  <p>When he landed, he walked up to Zheng and advised him, "Stop resisting."</p>

  <p>Heeding the advice, Zheng felt the slow infusion of green life vitality into his mind.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Ordinarily, being pressed down by two Internal Elixir Realm warriors could cause severe damage to one's soul. So, it surprised Elder Xu to find out this was not the case with Zheng. His soul sustained no serious injuries but was slightly weaker. And this would only take a day or two for the warrior to restore himself.</p>

  <p>Having witnessed Zheng's performance, Elder Xu was aware that his soul was stronger than that of ordinary martial artists, yet he was still surprised. 'Those two are so strong that I dare not despise them. I didn't expect this boy to make it through. So, it is quite impressive.'</p>

  <p>"Master Shi!"</p>

  <p>Recognition had him standing up quickly and Conn bowed to Kenneth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ray, who was on the other side, also carefully bowed to Kenneth.</p>

  <p>Even the emperor had to bow when he saw the leader of Cloud Sect, not to mention the two princes.</p>

  <p>When others saw Kenneth, regarded as the strongest man in the Eastern Region, they were shocked.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Kenneth didn't even bother to look at Conn or Ray and ignored them completely. Instead, he walked over to Zheng, patted him on the shoulder, and smiled. "How ambitious you are! That's my boy. You want to wipe out this country?</p>

  <p>That's great! I'm in!" he laughed.</p>

  <p>When he heard Kenneth's words, Ray felt that his heart was in his throat, and became extremely nervous.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Conn forced a smile, which was worse than a cry.</p>

  <p>If Kenneth wanted to wipe out the Burning Sky Empire, he could.</p>

  <p>When Kane was still alive, the emperor of the Burning Sky Empire was more powerful than Kenneth. Over the years, the empire grew in prosperity and strength because of him.</p>

  <p>But now, Kane was missing. Who could match and compete with Kenneth in the Burning Sky Empire?</p>

  <p>Eunuchs flanked Conn. One of them was a master at the primary level of Internal Elixir Realm and Conn's strongest supporter. Although powerful, he was still no match for Kenneth.</p>

  <p>There was Hendy, who assisted Ray, and had likewise reached the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>However, even if Hendy teamed up with the chief eunuch, they didn't stand a chance of conquering Kenneth.</p>

  <p>Other than Kenneth, there were vice leaders, elders, saints, and other excellent people in Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>So, it was quite impossible for them to confront Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>If Kenneth wanted to, he could kill them all, and recommend someone from other clans to be the emperor.</p>

  <p>He could even end up as Emperor of Burning Sky, and no one would have any objections.</p>

  <p>"Sir, wasn't that a little inappropriate?"</p>

  <p>Though frightened, Ray spoke politely.</p>

  <p>"Inappropriate?"</p>

  <p>Kenneth laughed arrogantly. "So what?" he said. "You think you can bully people? And why do you refuse to let anyone else fight back?</p>

  <p>You think you're the one... The Son of Heaven?"</p>

  <p>The view that the emperor was the Son of Heaven was nothing more than the opinion of ordinary people, or the words of the ruling class used to influence lesser people.</p>

  <p>Son of Heaven?</p>

  <p>That was the last thing martial artists would believe.</p>

  <p>They were trained to practice cultivation methods against the heaven.</p>

  <p>Tough-minded martial artists didn't care if their enemy was the heaven or the heaven's son.</p>

  <p>In a squeaky voice, one eunuch reminded, "Master Shi, you made a deal with our Emperor that you would stay out of Burning Sky Empire's affairs."</p>

  <p>Sneering, Kenneth said, "I know you stupid eunuch would bring this up.</p>

  <p>Relax...</p>

  <p>I have no interest in your country's internal strife, much less in destroying it. I only want to tell Zheng that he can return to you after he passes the test of Cloud Road, and enters Cloud Hall." He added, "I will never allow anyone outside the Cloud Sect to bully my disciples."</p>

  <p>Even with Kenneth reprimanding them, the eunuchs showed no signs of displeasure but felt relieved.</p>

  <p>Their greatest fear was Kenneth interfered in their struggle. If they upset the man, he would probably support the crown prince. In that case, they would have to turn over the throne to the crown prince. After all, no one dared to confront the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Throwing them a cold look, Zheng said coolly, "I will live up to your expectations."</p>

  <p>Conn and Ray looked at Zheng and felt slightly anxious.</p>

  <p>Although both men had gathered intelligence on Zheng, they continued to underestimate him in view of the present situation. In particular, they misjudged Zheng's talent and strength, as well as his status in Kenneth's heart.</p>

  <p>They had thought Kenneth would stay out of this business, as long as they didn't kill Zheng, but only taught him a lesson.</p>

  <p>No one actually hurt Zheng, but this already infuriated Kenneth. Why did Zheng make the leader of Cloud Sect think so highly of him? What on earth was the man capable of doing?</p>

  <p>Perhaps in time, he would be as good as Kenneth.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Raring to get out of the place, Kenneth didn't want to speak to them anymore, so he started getting ready to leave.</p>

  <p>Briefly hesitating, Zheng said, "Sir, Master Su..."</p>

  <p>But he was interrupted. "Of course, Aura will leave with us. And no one will dare to stop us!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Kenneth flew away. His rising figure was like a soaring mountain. According to the rules, flying over Burning Sky Palace was strictly prohibited, but Kenneth didn't care about rules at all.</p>

  <p>In mid-air, something occurred to Kenneth so he said, "By the way, Kane once told me that if he died, you could fight each other. And the winner can sit as the emperor. But I warn you, if you kill the crown prince, I will not let you go!"</p>

  <p>The man's words made Conn and Ray frown slightly.</p>

  <p>Kenneth's word was the law, and it was infallible. In the past, he had stayed out of the affairs of Burning Sky Empire. But now that he had said it, they must follow his orders. After all, he was the strongest man in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>He refused to let them hurt the crown prince. This order meant that Kenneth provided special protection for the prince. But for Ray and Conn, it was nearly impossible to seize the throne without hurting the crown prince.</p>

  <p>Yet, they were bound to obey Kenneth.</p>

  <p>Aura was clearly in an excellent mood. Then a green leaf suddenly appeared at Elder Xu's feet. Zheng and Aura together stepped on the leaf.</p>

  <p>As Aura glanced at her two younger brothers, she broke into a smile.</p>

  <p>Looking at the guy next to her, Aura couldn't help thinking, 'I didn't think he could do it.'</p>

  <p>Before the All Peaks Competition, Aura did entertain such fantasies, but she thought her dream was unrealistic.</p>

  <p>However, in less than a month, Zheng was able to make that dream come true, and this was quite surprising.</p>

  <p>The situation inside the palace had not changed, and Aura understood this. Her brother, the crown prince of Burning Sky Empire, was still unable to change his fate. However, with Kenneth's protection, there was a chance to change the situation.</p>

  <p>Since Kenneth valued Zheng very much, the young disciple could have the power to destroy the country in the future.</p>

  <p>Talks about destroying the Burning Sky Empire was merely a threat.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng had the strength to wipe out the country, he would never do that. After all, martial artists at that level were not interested in being emperors at all.</p>

  <p>The highest goal ordinary people aspired for was to be an emperor.</p>

  <p>Martial artists, however, had even loftier goals.</p>

  <p>In the days when Kane held so much power, he barely cared about the state of affairs. It was the crown prince who handled everything in Burning Sky Empire. As emperor, Kane often accepted missions from Cloud Hall and ventured out to fulfill them. He was not so much an emperor as a martial artist.</p>

  <p>In their return to Drizzle Peak, Aura and Zheng received a warm welcome from the peak's disciples.</p>

  <p>Drizzle Peak was completely different at this point. Numerous practicing realms and magic arrays were built to provide disciples with a better environment for improving themselves.</p>

  <p>As the first among thirty-three peaks that was able to move from the last place to first, Drizzle Peak made history. And this remarkable change benefited all of Drizzle Peak's disciples. They thanked Zheng for everything he had done, and Aura, for having brought Zheng to Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>However, their joy was shortlived. Something bizarre caused it to disappear.</p>

  <p>One day, a huge face suddenly appeared in the sky of Cloud Sect.</p>
