<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This huge skeleton had fallen into this world for eighty billion years.</p>

  <p>Before the appearance of this Chaos Ancient God's skeleton, all the exiles in this world would be purified by the Light of Adjudication every one thousand years. Everyone, not a single soul were saved then.</p>

  <p>But now, the presence of the Chaos Ancient God's skeleton provided them with shelters.</p>

  <p>That was why all exiles, no matter how powerful they were, stood in awe at how marvelous it was.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter if most of them knew that a large part of the skeleton was still buried underground. More importantly, they knew that the Chaos Ancient God's skull would be a perfect shield, when the time came.</p>

  <p>But no one dared to dig it out. What was visible to their eyes already served a good purpose.</p>

  <p>Even if the skeleton was already right in front of them, the exiles would never believe that the Chaos Ancient God had really died. Death was something they never imagined to dawn upon great beings.</p>

  <p>A powerful creature like the Chaos Ancient God had far surpassed the level of a living being. Their mind couldn't possibly grasp what would have happened billions of years ago. Even the boundary between life and death seemed uncertain to a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Inside the huge skull was a world about the size of the divine land, but it wasn't a real world of common sense. By comparison, this world was equivalent to an ordinary human's mind, which was a world made of spirit.</p>

  <p>After the Chaos Ancient God's consciousness had split, it formed a world of illusion. In this illusory world, thousands of brain units were created, each existing in a very special form. They could all think independently, even if there were no individual personalities in them.</p>

  <p>The fusion of these brain units was equal to the soul of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Beep! Beep! Beep!</p>

  <p>The sound went on after a drop of Zheng's blood was sent into the skull of the Chaos Ancient God, making it discoverable to one of the brain units.</p>

  <p>If one would only use their eyes to interpret these things, a brain unit would just be a small ball of light emitting a green halo. However, this form was only a representation in the outside world. If anyone could merge into the Chaos Ancient God's mind, then the image of the brain units would become vivid and specific.</p>

  <p>In fact, in this world inside the Chaos Ancient God's mind, the brain units also had their own aesthetic standard, their own language system, marriage, reproduction and social system. As complex as it seemed, all these were created by the Chaos Ancient God's own soul.</p>

  <p>Buzz! The halo around the small green ball gently fluctuated, which was the special language of these brain units. Its consciousness started conveying some messages. "There's a new blood sample here. I need to report this to the brain masters."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a green light flashed, making the ball disappear from its location.</p>

  <p>For the brain units, in this huge world of mind, the speed of their movements mainly depended on how fast the thoughts of the Chaos Ancient God changed. Therefore, the moving speed of the brain units was almost indefinite, giving them the ability to cross hundreds of millions of miles in an instant.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, the brain unit reappeared in the center of the mind world. A huge halo was inside this place, while many huge light balls hung from it. There were about a hundred huge light balls on the halo, also known as the brain masters.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, the brain masters were in deep sleep. They couldn't be bothered with things of low importance.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, when the small light ball appeared, one of the brain masters came to its senses.</p>

  <p>"No. 9527, what brought you here?"</p>

  <p>The brain master shone with dim light and buzzed. It couldn't help asking with its consciousness when the new presence bothered its sleep.</p>

  <p>Releasing its consciousness to communicate, the small light ball replied,</p>

  <p>"I found a new blood sample, which seems to belong to a Nine Li race member. Its smell is more fragrant than the previous ones. Do I need to observe its owner?"</p>

  <p>"Give up, No. 9527. It's not realistic to count on these people." The brain master sighed and said, "We have already observed each of the exiles here secretly. Sadly, no one has met any of our qualifications and requirements, let alone the descendants of the exiles. There is little hope since the third truth was revised."</p>

  <p>"But, sir, haven't you taught us not to give up at any time?" The small light ball hummed to contest, seeming unconvinced.</p>

  <p>At this time, another brain master also started flashing its light, "Ha-ha, we just want you little guys to live a more interesting life in this world."</p>

  <p>Expressing its anger, a trace of red light emerged on the surface of No. 9527. "You are the brain masters! How could you be like this? I strongly suggest that you test the blood sample that I find!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better give up, No. 9527. Just embrace a happy life in this world.</p>

  <p>That's more interesting than exploring those boring stuff, right?" The brain master persuaded it, "Don't disturb me anymore. Go away. I'm sleepy."</p>

  <p>After refusing its request, the light on the surface of these brain masters gradually dimmed, indicating that they fell asleep again.</p>

  <p>The surface of the small light ball emitted a strong red light and it hummed continuously, trying to wake up the brain masters. It tried for a few minutes but to no avail, none of them responded to it.</p>

  <p>"Fine. If that's the case, I will send the blood sample myself for testing!"</p>

  <p>The small light ball said angrily. It wasn't giving up just because it had been rejected by the brain masters.</p>

  <p>Each of the brain units had different powers. The ordinary ones, like the small light ball, didn't have much power. If it had been like before, they wouldn't have the right to test the blood if at least one of the brain masters was awake, and they would have to rely on the brain masters to do the work.</p>

  <p>But over the years, the brain masters were getting lazier and more relaxed. Sometimes, all the brain masters would be in deep sleep, not wanting to be disturbed.</p>

  <p>At such moments, the small light balls were given the right to do more, working in place of the brain masters.</p>

  <p>Under the brain unit's control, the drop of golden blood continued to fly through the huge skull, flying all the way to the center of the huge mouth of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>When the body of the Chaos Ancient God was still alive, there had been a huge tongue here. However, since his body had long decayed, all the flesh as well as his tongue had already disappeared.</p>

  <p>Instead, there was a funnel-shaped spiral in the middle of the large mouth.</p>

  <p>The small light ball was familiar with this spiral. In the past, the brain masters would get excited every time a new blood sample was collected in the bone towers. They then sent it to the spiral for inspection.</p>

  <p>Each time, the brain masters would start as hopeful as one could imagine, but in the end, the results would always disappoint them.</p>

  <p>After countless times of disappointment, the brain masters had completely given up, finally admitting defeat. They no longer held any hope for the creatures in this world.</p>

  <p>Despite learning about this, the small light ball was different from the brain masters. The brain masters might have lived long enough to witness too much, making them lose interest in many things. As for the small light ball, the world was still young and it believed that miracles might come when you least expected it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The drop of golden blood was sent into the center of the huge mouth, rushing its way inside.</p>

  <p>Tick tack!</p>

  <p>Dropping on the tunnel-shaped spiral, it began to rotate slowly inside it.</p>

  <p>The red glow on the surface of the light ball had dispersed. Its anger had now cooled down. Slowly, it started to emit the peaceful green light, focusing on observing the scene in front of it.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, it was not as hopeful as it was supposed to be. Even though the golden blood was very special and fragrant, it believed that the brain masters had set too high a standard in the past. It was nearly impossible that anyone in this world could reach that standard.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The small light ball's attention was caught by the sound coming from the spiral. Under its silent gaze, the color in the center of the spiral suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>"Blue?"</p>

  <p>Its consciousness seemed confused with the results. The small light ball was stunned for a moment.</p>

  <p>Over the years, every time a blood sample was sent into the spiral, the test result had always been the same. It had always been red.</p>

  <p>This time, however, it came up with a different color, making it so surprised to even react immediately.</p>
