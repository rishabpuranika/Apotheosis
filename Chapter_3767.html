</p>

  <p>"Squeak! There's something wrong with the whole Sanskrit Light Stage!" the Ear Mouse in the lead said.</p>

  <p>This Ear Mouse was called Fidel. It was one of the nineteen elders of the Ear Mouse race and held a high position in the race.</p>

  <p>"Why is there something wrong with the Sanskrit Light Stage? What's the problem?" Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>Zheng had passed through the Soul City quite smoothly. He had expected passing through the Land of Bone Tribulation to not be difficult either. But it didn't look easy.</p>

  <p>"Many bone caves have been damaged! A number of things have come in!"</p>

  <p>Fidel squeaked, horrified.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the Ghost-claw Worms had not been the only ones to drill into the bone caves from the outside.</p>

  <p>"You can leave the Other Shore, but why do you still choose to run like this?" Libby asked.</p>

  <p>The monsters outside the bone caves weren't like the Element Spirit race which stayed in the ice city. If they had no way out, they would recite the Illusion Breaking Rune and retreat.</p>

  <p>Libby didn't want to help the Ear Mice, but she also didn't stop Zheng when she noticed that he wanted to help them.</p>

  <p>If they really couldn't find a way out, the worst that would happen was that she and Zheng would temporarily have to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But even though the Ear Mice kept being chased by those monsters, they still did not retreat from the Other Shore. There had to be a reason for this!</p>

  <p>"Can't you see our feet?" Fidel squeaked.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Libby looked down to see that the footsteps of the Ear Mice were flashing with the pale blue light.</p>

  <p>"Soul Interdicting Water?" Zheng's gaze froze. "Do the Other Shore creatures of the Sanskrit Light Stage know how to use this thing?"</p>

  <p>"I think..."</p>

  <p>Libby was about to answer Zheng's question, but Fidel interrupted her and said, "Zheng, don't you have a good understanding of the Sanskrit Light Stage before entering it?"</p>

  <p>Today was the second time that he had been asked such a question and Zheng's face flamed in embarrassment. "Not really."</p>

  <p>"The entire Sanskrit Light Stage is soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>The Soul Binding Thread, the Soul Interdicting Water, and the Soul Restraining Sand on the Other Shore are produced here," replied Fidel.</p>

  <p>The Soul Interdicting Water in the Sanskrit Light Stage brought about many experiments among the super forces.</p>

  <p>After collecting the Soul Interdicting Water, one needed to steam it with fire to remove all the impurities within it and obtain the purest Soul Restraining Sand. If one processed the Soul Restraining Sand again, they could get the Soul Binding Thread which was more difficult to get rid of.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit Light Stage not only had the Land of Bone Tribulation, but was also considered to be a place rich in mineral resources. The mine here, however, would just be regarded as a tool for the Other Shore Realm warriors of the chaos to kill each other.</p>

  <p>"These bones are soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water!" Zheng exclaimed, astonished.</p>

  <p>"It's common sense. I thought you knew it," Libby said, shrugging.</p>

  <p>There had once been a small number of people who had been to the forbidden area outside the bone caves and seen the Soul Interdicting Water as an ocean. A large portion of bones were soaked in the sea, while the rest of bones remained above sea level.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Libby were at the bottom of these bones when they ascended from the Blooming Jade Stage, which meant that they were actually at the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>Strange creatures like the Ghost-claw Worms lived in the Soul Interdicting Water all year round and were clear about what their prey constituted. They would first attack creatures that were tainted with the Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>So they had taken to ignoring Zheng and Libby during the previous pursuit.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng had cut off their bodies, the Ghost-claw Worms didn't have any intention of attacking Zheng and Libby. They weren't intelligent and only kept chasing the Ear Mice all the time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Four Ghost-claw Worms sped up along the wall of the cave. The three fingers on their heads opened up, clamoring to grab the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>The three Ear Mice didn't give up and kept trying to escape the attacks of the Ghost-claw Worms.</p>

  <p>They were, after all, at the Holy Soul Realm. Their souls were no weaker than ordinary physical bodies.</p>

  <p>Fidel's body pressed against the ground as it rushed up along the circular wall of the cave, and managed to avoid the attack.</p>

  <p>The other two Ear Mice also used the same method to display their agility.</p>

  <p>But the Ghost-claw Worms were faster. One of the Ghost-claw Worms raised its three-fingered claw and grabbed one of the Ear Mice by the head, intending to drag it backwards.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse squeaked and struggled in anguish.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A sudden ray of sword light flashed at the Ghost-claw Worm's head, which was also its hand, and cut through it.</p>

  <p>A mouth appeared in the palm of the Ghost-claw Worm's broken hand, and it let out a painful scream.</p>

  <p>The three fingers released the Ear Mouse, as the Ghost-claw Worm rolled back and forth on the ground in pain.</p>

  <p>Once the Ear Mouse broke free from the Ghost-claw Worm's grip, it recovered quickly and hurried to follow Fidel.</p>

  <p>"This will be easy to deal with, especially since these Ghost-claw Worms are hell-bent on attacking only you," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Ghost-claw Worms were not invulnerable to blades and spears. They only moved fast, were large in number, and were very aggressive. But killing them wasn't difficult, especially with Zheng's current strength.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>Fidel and the other Ear Mice were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>The Ghost-claw Worms had chased them for a long time, and several of their members had died as a result of this.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Several more Ghost-claw Worms sped up and rushed over to them.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his head, his gaze narrowing. The long sword in his hand had already started to emit specks of starlight.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>After several consecutive sword strikes, Zheng stabbed at the wrists of the Ghost-claw Worms, which were also their necks.</p>

  <p>The beheaded Ghost-claw Worms fell to the ground one after another, wailing and rolling on the ground. They were no longer able to chase the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>After he had figured out how to deal with the Ghost-claw Worms, Zheng found that it was easy to handle them.</p>

  <p>There were a large number of Ghost-claw Worms behind him. But as long as there were worms that dared to stretch their heads out, Zheng would use his long sword to chop, stab and behead them.</p>

  <p>In five minutes, Zheng had killed more than thirty Ghost-claw Worms.</p>

  <p>An hour later, there were only a few Ghost-claw Worms scattered on the wall.</p>

  <p>Zheng stopped and waved his long sword towards the sky. An arc-shaped sword light shot out of the sword and cut off the heads of the Ghost-claw Worms. They were now all struggling on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice stopped running and breathed a collective sigh of relief when the Ghost-claw Worms were finally killed.</p>

  <p>"We got rid of them!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng, we would have died if it weren't for you!"</p>

  <p>"What a coincidence! You saved my son in the Chaotic Source World before. You hadn't stepped into the Desire World at the time. I haven't expected you to reach the Sanskrit Light Stage and save my life," one of the Ear Mice exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The three Ear Mice were expressing their gratitude when Libby suddenly asked, "But where are we now?"</p>

  <p>At her question, the Ear Mice began to panic. Caught up in the chase that the Ghost-claw Worms had given them, they had no idea which bone cave they were in now.</p>
