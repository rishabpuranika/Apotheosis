  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since two warriors had already volunteered, the battle commenced.</p>

  <p>Once the sparring began, the crowd roared. Warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were extremely strong, and nothing stopped them from showing everyone the depths of their strength and abilities. If they could, they would move mountains and overturn seas just so they could let everyone know how much they shouldn't be messed with.</p>

  <p>Two warriors at the Soul Sea Realm on the platform walked down the stairs to wave their hands until they created thin lines that later on formed the enchanted barrier that surrounded the square. The space inside the enchanted barrier was where the battle took place.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier created by warriors at the Soul Sea Realm wasn't just something that could be broken by any warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Thinking that those fights didn't have much to do with him, Luo Luo Zheng didn't pay that much attention.</p>

  <p>After all, he wasn't from any of the four divine kingdoms. What he was more concerned about was entering the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>However, he had no other choice at that time but be patient until a victor was announced.</p>

  <p>According to Luo Zheng's estimation, that battle wasn't going to last very long.</p>

  <p>There were only four warriors in the Harlen Divine Kingdom that could be ranked in the first tier. Soon, the warriors who were to represent the entire Harlen Divine Kingdom would only be four people? the crown prince, Lord Randy, Edwin, and Gregory.</p>

  <p>Even if the Star Field and York Divine Kingdoms were slightly stronger than the Harlen Divine Kingdom, the number of warriors that could be ranked in the first tier wasn't too many. At most, there could only be around six or seven from each of the two divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>On the square, many warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were anxiously watching the battle within the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The sense of belonging that the warriors of the four divine kingdoms felt was far greater than that of the disciples of the sects in the Central Region. Warriors that were born in the divine kingdoms paid more attention to the glory of their respective divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>That battle was a showdown between warriors of two different divine kingdoms. Naturally, the other warriors from the same kingdoms who were watching were both nervous and concerned. As for the warriors of the Harlen and Wind Divine Kingdoms, they just watched from the sidelines.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Tongues of flames filled the arena. The moment the two warriors entered the fighting square, the atmosphere had turned fiercely hot.</p>

  <p>It was every young warrior's dream to represent their own divine kingdoms and not one of them intended on losing the battle. For most of them, it was all or nothing.</p>

  <p>"Huh. So Logan Yun is considered an invincible warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, huh? Warriors at the York Divine Kingdom are nothing but a bunch of boastful losers!"</p>

  <p>"I agree with you. Titus is going to kill him. He's definitely not a match for Titus!" The warriors who were discussing were both from the Wisteria Martial House and could be Titus Zhao's friends.</p>

  <p>However, a warrior from the York Divine Kingdom refused to be looked down upon. "Ha! We'll see about that! It will only take a little time before Logan beats your Titus to a pulp!"</p>

  <p>"What did you just say? Will you believe me if I also told you that I can beat you to a pulp right here, right now?"</p>

  <p>As soon as the fight began, the entire square was filled with an extremely loud uproar. The warriors from the divine kingdoms who had representatives on the current duel were all excited as if all of them were ready to fight at any given moment, too.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the craze, Luo Luo Zheng only shook his head and allowed a smile to play on his face. Even if those warriors were already at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, they still acted like kids.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the Central Region and the war lords on the Sea God Continent seemed much more mature.</p>

  <p>The more he looked at the situation, the more Luo Luo Zheng understood. All those Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors grew up in martial houses. Fighting was a way of life for them. They were elites among elites.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the Central Region were over a hundred years old, while those from the divine kingdoms were much younger.</p>

  <p>As for the war lords on the Sea God Continent, they had experienced many trials and tribulations in the Tower of Sin. Their personalities had been hardened by life and death crises, so they were naturally not so naive or easily angered.</p>

  <p>That event happened about once each year. The warriors at the Soul Sea Realm didn't care much about the ongoing banter. Their focus was solely on the fight that was happening mid-air.</p>

  <p>Titus Zhao had cultivated a polished fire-system cultivation method. In addition, he also seemed to have grasped the third layer of the Fire Law.</p>

  <p>Within those flames, extreme power of annihilation was contained.</p>

  <p>As he sized him up, Luo Luo Zheng was able to confirm that Titus Zhao's strength wasn't that simple at all.</p>

  <p>But the other warrior named Logan Yun was even stronger. Space was constantly twisting around his body, forcibly blocking all the flames.</p>

  <p>Was it true that he really was invincible?</p>

  <p>'Huh? Did he just use the space power to create thin layers of space to generate an armor?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered in his heart. At the certain realization,</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed. That was the third layer of Space Law. Even to him, that was something he was unable to comprehend for the time being. It was true that the four divine kingdoms really had a very deep foundation.</p>
