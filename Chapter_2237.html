<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everything happened so fast that it was all a blur. After Luo Zheng used the Eight Smoky Melodies, he suddenly lost his weight and floated in the air like smoke.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Sheridan didn't pull his punches.</p>

  <p>The red light on his fingers intertwined with each other as numerous small red rings circled all around his fingertips. A pleasant, metallic clang rang out every time the rings came into contact with each other.</p>

  <p>When he slightly tapped his fingers, a strange red sword light burst out from his fingertips!</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>The Eight Smoky Melodies was known as a flexible skill in the Evolutionary Universe because it didn't have much gravity, and all the things inside it were relatively lighter than those in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't as effective when used in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, the Eight Smoky Melodies was just an ordinary kind of martial arts technique. Thus, Luo Zheng found it hard to use it against Sheridan's Godly Way. Sometimes, he even had to roll on the ground just to dodge the red sword radiance, and it made him look very awkward.</p>

  <p>"Dodge towards this side!"</p>

  <p>"Move back! Move back quickly!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Aleyna and Kelsey cheered nervously but excitedly for Luo Zheng as they couldn't participate in the battle. They didn't know how dangerous his situation really was, but they believed that he could turn the odds to his favor.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng clearly wanted to do so.</p>

  <p>However, his opponent had the advantage since the beginning, so he almost had no chance to fight back. He was even lucky enough to dodge the sword radiance, but he knew that he couldn't keep going like this.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A red sword radiance left a long trail of red light in the air as it swept past Zheng's face. It left a scratch on his cheek that was almost invisible to the naked eye, but strings of blood gushed out from the very small wound.</p>

  <p>His face remained impassive, but his eyes began to burn with rage.</p>

  <p>His opponent, who was much faster than him continuously shot sword radiance from his fingers to attack. Furthermore, he always maintained a distance of three steps away from Luo Zheng, which left him no way to escape.</p>

  <p>Despite his tight predicament, Luo Zheng quickly did a mental analysis of the situation.</p>

  <p>He knew that he had limited means to use in the face of such a strong opponent. Aside from all kinds of Godly Ways, the best thing that he had thought of was only his physical strength.</p>

  <p>As soon as the idea popped into his head, he suddenly turned around and ran towards the other direction.</p>

  <p>A cold smile was plastered on Sheridan's face as he leisurely chased after Luo Zheng, while the sword radiance in his fingertips continued to shoot his target.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng stopped in his tracks. His feet left two small holes on the solid ground. At the same time, his great power caused the entire hall to shake violently!</p>

  <p>Even if he had no choice but to rely on his powerful strength and body to stop so abruptly, his opponent couldn't do such a thing. If Sheridan tried to do the same, he would've slipped some feet away. Experienced warriors could always foresee their estimated distance in advance and stop at their desired spot, but Luo Zheng didn't give Sheridan the time.</p>

  <p>If he did attempt to do the same thing Luo Zheng did, his body would probably fail to withstand the momentum and his legs would most likely be fractured.</p>

  <p>At one glance, Zheng's move looked rather simple, but it required a high level of physical strength and a tough body. Not even the True Gods could achieve such a feat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was currently faced against a True God, so he had no other better options but to exert his physical strength to the limit.</p>

  <p>Clearly, Sheridan was shocked to see that Luo Zheng could suddenly stop in his tracks then quickly stand still like a tree trunk, while he still rushed towards Luo Zheng with an unstoppable momentum. Yet, he wasn't nervous in the slightest. After all, he was much stronger than Keenan, and knew too many methods to fight against a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew as he rushed towards Luo Zheng with two outstretched fingers, which sent three beams of sword radiance in a row. At the same time, he twisted his body in an attempt to bypass Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was a slight glint in Zheng's eyes as he had expected such a counterattack. His strong body rolled in the air, and his flexible limbs contorted into a certain pose so that all the three beams of sword radiance skimmed through his underarm, crotch, and waist, respectively.</p>

  <p>After he had evaded the three beams of sword radiance, he quickly tried to grab Sheridan.</p>

  <p>However, the sword radiance that was shot towards him forced him to dodge slightly to the left, as Sheridan slid to the right. They were three feet away from each other, but Luo Zheng couldn't seem to reach him.</p>

  <p>"You are too naive," Sheridan said with a complacent smile, as if everything had happened according to his calculation.</p>

  <p>However, he noticed that Zheng's lips were also curved into a mocking grin.</p>

  <p>'What is he laughing at?'</p>

  <p>Just as Sheridan thought about Zheng's intentions, an invisible hand pressed against him and slammed him hard to the ground.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Another violent tremor shook the whole hall once again!</p>

  <p>All the people present were speechless at the unexpected scene in front of them.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"What forced Sheridan to the ground?"</p>

  <p>"It looked like an invisible power. How could that man control his power in that way? Did he cultivate the Might Godly Way to a high level?"</p>

  <p>More and more murmurs filled the hall. They couldn't believe what had just happened!</p>

  <p>Some of them were knowledgeable and knew that there were only two ways to freely circulate one's physical strength around their bodies. The first was to cultivate the Might Godly Way to a high level. After one cultivated to the third stage of the Might Godly Way, they could extend their strength beyond their bodies and form a new body— an invisible body formed from their extended strength. This body was powerful, and could also serve as a shield.</p>

  <p>The second method was to comprehend the Cross-world Theurgy. With this skill, a Holy Being could gather the power from their inner worlds wherever they went.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng wasn't a Holy Being, he couldn't use the Cross-world Theurgy.</p>

  <p>But even if he cultivated the Might Godly Way, he hadn't even condensed his Godly Tile. Thus, how did he get to cultivate to the third stage of the Might Godly Way?</p>

  <p>It was why it came as no surprise when everyone wanted to know how he had managed to extend his physical strength.</p>

  <p>Even the top-rank True Gods who had come with the warriors all looked at him with utter shock and confusion.</p>

  <p>While everyone was still in a daze, Zheng's eyes glittered with murderous intent. He grabbed the air, and the invisible hand lifted Sheridan up from the ground.</p>

  <p>Sheridan was still out of his wits because of the heavy slap. Now, he looked limp and lifeless as he was hung in midair.</p>

  <p>There was an uproar when Luo Zheng suddenly launched his attacks. His fingers continuously hit Sheridan's limbs, chest, and spine!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>All of his moves were extremely precise and crushed the most important bones and joints all over Sheridan's body. It was too much that before Sheridan could react or even scream, he already lost his consciousness because of the immense pain!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was satisfied enough, he threw him onto the ground and stepped on him. He looked around the hall coldly and said, "I didn't intend to offend you here today, but these girls of the Han Clan are my old acquaintances, so I have to step out and help them. If you want to try my strength, I am willing to spar with you inside the Jade Wall of Legends. But if anyone wants to kill me here, I'm afraid that this guy will have to join me in hell!"</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice died down, he lightly stepped on the gem mark on Sheridan's forehead. Had Luo Zheng used his full power, he could even make a top-rank True God's head explode. What more with Sheridan, who was only a low-rank True God?</p>
