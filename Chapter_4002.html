<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Wind ran through the six-headed eagle's feathery wings as it flew slowly.</p>

  <p>It almost had no real opponents in the Supreme Pure Realm, or perhaps no other creatures dared to challenge it.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it also had no natural enemies, so there was no need for it to be too vigilant.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagle's nest was built on top of a mountain, where it housed three crystal-clear eggs.</p>

  <p>All the living beings in the Supreme Pure Realm highly treasured those glowing eggs. That was because the liquid inside the eggs had a magical corrosive ability? and in theory, it could corrode everything, even space itself.</p>

  <p>That corrosive ability was the six-headed eagle's talent. Some creatures hoped to have such an ability, so they tried to subdue, lure, or even force the six-headed eagle, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>After all, the six-headed eagle was the most irritable creature in the Supreme Pure Realm. Anyone who dared provoke it got corroded into a wisp of smoke.</p>

  <p>If they wanted to stay in the Supreme Pure Realm, however, they needed to rely on the six-headed eagle's corrosive ability to break spaces.</p>

  <p>But since they couldn't personally use its powers, they shifted their attention to its eggs. Besides, the corrosive power inside the eggs was much stronger than its own.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the six-headed eagle was not intelligent, nor did it live in groups.</p>

  <p>Thus, it gave the other creatures a chance to steal its eggs.</p>

  <p>At that moment, several people in thick robes came for the six-headed eagle's eggs.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As they advanced, the color of their thick robes steadily changed.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the six-headed eagle did not notice them along the way at all.</p>

  <p>After they followed the six-headed eagle for four hundred miles, they finally saw a massive nest.</p>

  <p>Thick green tree branches sprawled across the mountaintop and their seemingly irregular arrangement formed a typical nest. From afar, it looked like a green ring on top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Aoo! Aoo!"</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagle roared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Six heads popped out from the nest in response. It was another eagle.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the flying eagle was the male, which was responsible for hunting outside, while the female eagle that stayed in the nest hatched the eggs.</p>

  <p>Then, the male loosened its grip and dropped its prey down from the sky.</p>

  <p>The prey was a big stone turtle.</p>

  <p>The stone turtle was one of the sturdiest creatures in the Supreme Pure Realm. Its stone shell had a very tough defensive strength. The shell looked ordinary, but it contained a unique space rule. Even some of the most powerful creatures couldn't capture it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the stone turtle fell, the female eagle caught it with its five heads.</p>

  <p>These eagles' six heads were not independent. The biggest head was in charge of the other heads. If it got decapitated, a second head took its place.</p>

  <p>The five heads were like one hand that caught the stone turtle.</p>

  <p>As soon as it caught its prey, the biggest head opened its mouth and gently spat at the stone turtle.</p>

  <p>Green liquid splattered all over the turtle shell.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The eagle's green saliva was highly corrosive. As a result, the indestructible turtle shell quickly began to crack.</p>

  <p>The turtle inside the shell began to struggle like mad under the intense pain and tried to escape from the female eagle.</p>

  <p>However, it could not break free since it directly fell into the eagles' nest.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the female eagle's heads probed inside the turtle shell through the crack and began to eat the stone turtle's flesh. It was quite a bloody scene.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, it ate up the whole stone turtle and threw the shell down the mountain. The shell fell to the ground with a slight crash, and left a big hole on the soil.</p>

  <p>There were many kinds of bones at the foot of the mountain. All of them were remains from the eagles' food.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the creatures wrapped in thick robes hid at the foot of the mountain. The sudden crash of the turtle shell startled them, and when the leader saw the shell's corroded surface, he could not help but shake his head and sigh.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagle had used a lot of its saliva to erode the turtle shell, and they only needed a cup of it.</p>

  <p>However, the six-head eagle was quite irritable and attacked anyone who trespassed its territory. If they wanted to obtain its corrosive saliva, they had to carefully take the eggs away.</p>

  <p>Just then, the leader raised his hands and secretly made a gesture.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the mountain far away, a man in a black robe brought out an iron cage from his Sumeru Space. Then, he left the cage on the ground and trotted away.</p>

  <p>The iron cage continuously shook after it was placed on the ground like something wanted to get out of it.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The creature inside kept kicking the cage until it finally broke. A black bird that was as tall as a human came out. It was a Black Teeth Swallow. It flew very fast, and it was the six-headed eagles' favorite food.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Black Teeth Swallow did not know that there was a natural enemy above it. It just wanted to return to the sky right now.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to it, the male eagle was at one side of its nest, looking around.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, it saw a black shadow above. Its six heads let out excited squawks at the same time. The Black Teeth Swallow was its favorite food after all, but it was too small to fill its belly. Thus, it was not worth to travel thousands of miles to hunt for it.</p>

  <p>The Black Teeth Swallow seldom appeared in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, but the six-headed eagles did not fear anything. After all, two eagles guarded the nest.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the Black Teeth Swallow saw its natural enemy in the distance, it immediately felt scared to death and used all of its strength to escape.</p>

  <p>The men in robes had previously fed it with the Phoenix Blood, which increased its speed for a few hours. The six-headed eagles would not catch up with it in just a short time.</p>

  <p>Thus, the two birds, one big and one small, quickly flew into the distance.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing what happened, the leader of the men in black robes waved his hand again. Then, another man nearby placed an iron cage on the ground. In a few seconds, a second Black Teeth Swallow came out of the cage.</p>

  <p>The female eagle did not usually leave the nest.</p>

  <p>However, it clearly could not resist the temptation of its favorite food.</p>

  <p>The female eagle in the nest also keenly discovered the Black Teeth Swallow that was quickly rising in the air. It let out an anxious squawk in an attempt to call the male eagle to catch the Black Teeth Swallow.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, the male eagle had left to chase after the first Black Teeth Swallow.</p>

  <p>The female eagle thought about its own situation. It thought that it would not take too long to hunt a Black Teeth Swallow. Therefore, for the first time, it left the nest and chased after the second Black Teeth Swallow.</p>

  <p>The men in robes had also fed the second Black Teeth Swallow with the Phoenix Blood. It flew at top speed and lured the female eagle to fly away quickly.</p>

  <p>"They are really stupid birds!" the leader sneered. "Hurry up! Now is the time!" he urged his companions.</p>

  <p>In turn, the other men in robes jumped and climbed towards the nest at the top of the mountain.</p>
