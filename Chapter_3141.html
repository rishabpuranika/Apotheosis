  <p>
</p>


  <p>
</p>

  <p>The disciples waiting outside the Flow Tower watched the golden dot of light struggle, a satisfied smile playing at their lips.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng was a disciple of the same sect as them; it was improper for them to openly jeer at him. Naturally, they hoped Zheng would fail. Seeing the wobbly golden dot hinted to failure excited them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, those women in white had no scruples about speaking their mind.</p>

  <p>"He has been rated Poor for two consecutive months. He deserves it!"</p>

  <p>"Do you see how he's struggling on the first floor? There's no way he'll last.</p>

  <p>Just you wait. He'll come out when he can't hold on any longer."</p>

  <p>"I'm betting it'll take five minutes, at most!"</p>

  <p>They all shot hateful glances at Trish and Carrie as they spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that Mr. Luo won't make it," Carrie said, her voice trembling slightly.</p>

  <p>"As long as he tries his best, it doesn't matter how this will end," Trish said reassuringly as she watched the golden dot on the wall of the tower. "What matters is he doesn't give up; he's still trying his best to jump onto the second floor."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Trish, you are so good at finding excuses to console yourself..." a woman in white beside Trish said haughtily. "Remember how he promised to you before he entered the tower? Look at him now, he's so lame!" She threw her head back and laughed.</p>

  <p>Trish glared at the girl in white.</p>

  <p>The woman who was laughing was Winnie Su. She was good at making people feel bad. Usually Trish didn't take things to heart. Nevertheless, Winnie Su insisted on creating drama.</p>

  <p>"Time is not up yet. Our master still has the chance to succeed," said Trish calmly.</p>

  <p>"Chance? Hahaha...!" Winnie Su could only laugh at Trish's naivete.</p>

  <p>Anyone who watched keenly could tell that a weak warrior like Zheng barely had the chance of turning the situation around.</p>

  <p>Trish was definitely aware of this, but she was reluctant to admit it. Zheng was her master, after all.</p>

  <p>Time ticked by...</p>

  <p>These people had been by the tower for more than twenty hours, yet surprisingly, they waited patiently.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, was still at the bottom of the Flow Tower, motionless.</p>

  <p>"The Flame of Soul... It's not a real flame. It should be a kind of energy..."</p>

  <p>As Zheng grew stronger, he now had a better understanding of how this world worked.</p>

  <p>Any matter in the world was created with energy. The sea water of the Sea of Truth, the Other Shore Power, the internal momentum and life vitality... they were all different kinds of energy. And the self that formed in the soul was the ruler that controlled the energy.</p>

  <p>'This kind of flame can affect people's emotions. I feel pain because my emotions are affected, ' Zheng pondered as he lowered his head. 'In this case, if I use the Emotion Closing Godly Way, could I avoid being affected by the Flame of Soul?'</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed as he began to channel his energy.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way was a kind of special energy, and, as its name implied, it could also affect one's emotions.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of the Great Dominance Technique had the same function. The difference was that the Emotion Closing Godly Way was targeted at the cultivators themselves, whereas the Great Dominance Technique was targeted at others.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing..."</p>

  <p>As he was gathering the internal momentum, his eyes gradually turned cold and merciless.</p>

  <p>All the things in the world seemed to fall away from him. Only his self-consciousness was left.</p>

  <p>Inside the Flow Tower, there was no more sadness, joy, hatred, nor pain.</p>

  <p>The red Flame of Soul collected itself until it formed a face.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Here comes another guy practicing the Emotion Closing Godly Way..." it said amusedly. Red flames that made up its eyebrows raised in surprise.</p>

  <p>The division of the Godly Ways varied in the Source World. Some forces divided the Godly Ways into over two thousand and seven hundred kinds, and some divided them into over two thousand and nine hundred kinds.</p>

  <p>Different forces divided them in different ways.</p>

  <p>However, very few people in the divine land and the Source World chose to practice the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, the Emotion Closing Godly Way was extremely difficult to cultivate. On the other hand, it was difficult to reach consummation of this Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Actually, Zheng had relied on Fuxi's help to improve his cultivation of the Emotion Closing Godly Way to its consummation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the cultivators in the Source World all aimed at reaching the Other Shore. When one could choose the Five Elements Godly Way which was much easier to cultivate, who in their right mind would consider the more difficult and troublesome Emotion Closing Godly Way?</p>

  <p>The face formed by the Flame of Soul had originally intended to suggest Zheng leave the tower, but now he was a little curious about him. "Be warned: the Emotion Closing Godly Way isn't as omnipotent as you think! Whether you can comprehend its profoundness will depend on your understanding."</p>

  <p>After Zheng used the Emotion Closing Godly Way to cut off his emotions, he looked upwards. For the second time, he jumped.</p>

  <p>Instantly, he felt the Flame of Soul blaze in his chest!</p>

  <p>Zheng felt his negative emotions surging, however, at the same time, he felt them being blocked and almost... contained.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way acted like an enchanted barrier, completely blocking out the negative emotions.</p>

  <p>"I made it... It's so easy!"</p>

  <p>Zheng remained calm. If he wasn't in the state of emotion closing, he'd have probably jumped with joy by now.</p>

  <p>However, the Flame of Soul did not extinguish. As Zheng jumped up, he felt the flame growing more and more intense. Just as he was about to step on to the second floor, the flames collectively shot straight to the spot between his eyebrows as though they were possessed.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a blow to his head and his vision blacked out. Once again, he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way was said to have the ability to cut off all the emotions. But in fact, it only acted as a barrier that kept all his emotions out, leaving him with only his rational consciousness.</p>

  <p>The Great Dominance Technique worked in the same way. It blocked the opponent's self-consciousness and replaced it with the user's own self-consciousness. This way, the user could manipulate their foe like a puppetmaster with their puppet.</p>

  <p>But just because the self-consciousness was blocked, it didn't mean that it didn't exist.</p>

  <p>Zheng's obsession was strong, so the backlash he suffered was powerful. The Flame of Soul had gathered together and all attacked one point, making it possible to break through the barrier, coming straight at Zheng's soul!</p>

  <p>"To be honest, the warriors who practice Emotion Closing Godly Way are indeed suitable for joining the Flow Sword Sect... But it's a pity your obsession is too strong. Also, the way you used the Emotion Closing Godly way is a bit rough, haha!" The face that was formed by the Flame of Soul spoke once again, jeering at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Rough?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had already reached the consummation of Emotion Closing Godly Way, yet his method of using it was regarded as rough. Naturally, he couldn't let this slide.</p>

  <p>However, reflecting upon how the Flame of Soul attacked him just now, he realized something.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng just used the Emotion Closing Godly Way as a way of attack, and he hoped that it would become his most powerful swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>But, he needed to consider that the Source World was different. The Godly Ways had evolved here for a long time and the methods of using them were more diversified. For example, just now, Zheng could have used the Emotion Closing Godly Way to avoid the Flame of Soul from attacking one point on him.</p>

  <p>As Zheng pondered over this, he gathered his wits and sat cross-legged on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way he learned did not teach him such a method, so he could only explore it by himself.</p>

  <p>There were so many theurgies beyond ways in the divine land, which were also figured out by those True Gods themselves, and Zheng thought he could also explore and figure out a theurgy beyond Emotion Closing Godly Way himself.</p>

  <p>From outside the tower, the people counted the minutes. Five minutes had passed...</p>

  <p>Ten minutes had passed...</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes had passed...</p>

  <p>Finally, an hour had passed quickly. The people began to grow restless.</p>

  <p>"He just tried twice, and failed twice. Now, he won't even move. What a coward..."</p>

  <p>"He might be questioning the meaning of his life at the bottom of the tower!"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter what he is doing. Time is almost up."</p>

  <p>As the women were whispering amongst themselves, the door of one of the courtyard houses behind the Flow Tower quietly creaked open.</p>

  <p>A young man in a coir raincoat, with a beautiful girl in his arms, slowly walked towards the tower.</p>
