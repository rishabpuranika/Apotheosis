<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng followed the handsome man's gaze and read the name engraved below the statue.</p>

  <p>"Is King Manard your master?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Both the handsome and the charming nodded, their faces displaying awe and respect at the mention of their master.</p>

  <p>Just from the man's words, Zheng had obtained some valuable information.</p>

  <p>There was a time when the human race had prospered in the chaos. But like the other past civilizations, they had failed to complete the Finale Way. In the end, they had no choice but to hide on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The ancient humans of the Other Shore remained off the grid for countless years— Zheng surmised that they had gone into hiding like the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>From that, Zheng suspected that the birth of the human race in this round of chaos was no coincidence. Perhaps, the human race on the Other Shore had used some kind of special method to revive the human civilization in the chaos through the flourishing of the Nine Li race, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Zheng was well aware that the man and woman had just been waiting for a human, not specifically him.</p>

  <p>His appearance signaled the beginning of the ancient human civilization's plan.</p>

  <p>"Do you agree with my conjecture?" Through his consciousness, Zheng asked No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>Both of them were figures of wisdom and insight, and they found Zheng's speculations to be convincing. But No. 9527 then added, "But humans are not united as they should be. If your speculations are right, all humans born in this round of chaos should be created by the ancient human civilization.</p>

  <p>The problem is, the Bearing race, the Oneness Sky Palace, and Fuxi from the Pear Hill are on bad terms."</p>

  <p>The thought bewildered Zheng. If the ancient humans wanted to achieve a certain goal, the new human race they had created must unite toward a single mission. Why then did they split into several branches, holding different positions and following different paths?</p>

  <p>"Something unnatural must have happened," remarked the Regal Jade Spirit. "The creatures on the Other Shore can't visit the chaos freely due to the Other Shore's special nature. They have to choose spokespersons to fight for them. But the races on the Other Shore don't exactly have much control over the creatures in the chaos."</p>

  <p>"Did you have spokespersons before?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course! Ever since the 751st civilization, we've chosen a spokesperson at the beginning of every civilization. That is, until we were defeated and had to go into hiding at Stage Thirteen. Several of our spokespersons had betrayed us, though. It's rather common on the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>The creatures in the chaos entered the Other Shore in pursuit of greater power.</p>

  <p>All those chosen as a civilization's spokesperson usually had a good amount of luck and willpower— someone who was reluctant to lower themselves to anyone else's level. After converting to another path, it wasn't surprising for them to betray the civilization they represent.</p>

  <p>Having experienced many more rounds of chaos than No. 9527, the Regal Jade Spirit had a greater say on the matter.</p>

  <p>After the short discussion in his consciousness, Zheng turned to the handsome man and said, "King Manard is indeed a great figure— he managed to control this entire place. I just wonder what he plans to do here."</p>

  <p>To Zheng's surprise, the pair shook their heads and replied, "We don't know what Master's plan is. He just tasked us to stay here until the first human is exiled to this place."</p>

  <p>"And what if other creatures are exiled here?" Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>He figured that the Chaos Ancient Gods would get rid of a lot of spaces in a round of chaos. There must have been many creatures of various races who ended up in this place.</p>

  <p>"We killed them," replied the man indifferently.</p>

  <p>The charming woman then smiled, "Long ago, a huge space was sent here, along with a great number of powerful creatures. He slaughtered them all— I didn't even have time to finish off a single one!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, their carefree replies had Zheng standing still in a daze.</p>

  <p>Only the most powerful creatures in the chaos could be regarded as opponents of the Chaos Ancient Gods. Was it really possible for such powerful things to be killed so easily?</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the pair had been there for countless years. Zheng felt no air of deception from them, nor could he think of any reason why they would lie to him.</p>

  <p>"Did King Manard tell you what to do if a human arrived?" Zheng asked, thinking it was alright to be straightforward with them.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled as she replied, "Of course! You must wait for Master to return."</p>

  <p>"How long do we have to wait?" The thought made Zheng frown.</p>

  <p>If he stayed there for too long, he might fail to return before the Chaotic Source World closed— he'd be in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>The man before him merely shook his head. "We don't know. The time of Master's return is never fixed. His last departure lasted for 800 units of time.</p>

  <p>But I believe he will return sooner this time."</p>

  <p>"Eight hundred… how long is that?" Zheng was unfamiliar with the measurement.</p>

  <p>"According to the chaos' time flow rate, a unit of time equals ten thousand years," he explained calmly.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened at the man's nonchalant answer.</p>

  <p>That meant King Manard could return after eight million years— Zheng couldn't stay there anywhere near that long.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be in a hurry, am I right?" Noticing Zheng's worried expression, the woman asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I am! I have something urgent to deal with in the chaos. Is there any way to leave?" Zheng's anxiety was pouring into his voice at this point.</p>

  <p>The woman only shook her head. "No. But perhaps Master can help you."</p>

  <p>"Is there any way to inform your master that I've arrived?" he asked further.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the man and woman exchanged a curious glance before the man said, "Of course. Master told us that if a human was exiled to this place, we could report it to him."</p>

  <p>At that, Zheng's eyes lit up. "Can you inform him right now?"</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, the man nodded. "Alright. Follow me."</p>

  <p>An ancient gate lay behind the palace. Once they entered the gate with Zheng, they arrived at the edge of this world— a wall covered with black fluff.</p>

  <p>The wall seemed to go on endlessly. They couldn't see its end from either direction.</p>

  <p>All creatures, regardless of size, would feel powerless and insignificant in the face of this enormous wall.</p>

  <p>Nearby was a small round cave.</p>

  <p>"No words can be sent out in this place. We have to leave the place to inform Master. This is the passageway that leads outside," the man explained.</p>

  <p>Looking curiously at the cave, Zheng asked, "Did your master dig this cave out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Master started to dig this even before we were born. He spent about eight million units of time before reaching the other end and outside the chaos. Master is a persistent man!"</p>

  <p>Eight million units of time… that meant eighty billion years. 'That's a terribly long time, ' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe someone actually managed to dig through the chaos…" the Regal Jade Spirit muttered in astonishment in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it either…" remarked No. 9527.</p>

  <p>The two had a far greater understanding of the chaos than Zheng did and yet even they agreed that digging all the way out of the chaos was something unheard of.</p>
