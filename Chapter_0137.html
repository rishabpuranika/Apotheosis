<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 137 The Illuminating Soul Realm (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The onlookers couldn't figure out why the man at the Illuminating Soul Realm needed to display such power when dealing with a weaker opponent.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a cultivator at the Illuminating Soul Realm could kill an outer disciple with only one finger.</p>

  <p>"That poor outer disciple must be frightened to death," stated one of the bystanders.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had left, Master Su secluded herself in a pavilion at Drizzle Peak and watched his every move on the picture slab.</p>

  <p>Through the picture slab, Master Su was able to get a better understanding of everything that was happening with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You brat! You are a real troublemaker," Master Su murmured even though Zheng was not around to hear her. Master Su looked northwest and frowned. Even from this distance, she could see the light column emitted by Vale.</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether you survive or not. Since you think you're so good, figure out a solution to the situation in which you find yourself! He's such a pain in the neck," Master Su said to herself angrily.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a talented disciple, but he was stubborn and refused to heed her advice.</p>

  <p>In fact, none of the masters of Cloud Sect had much control over their disciples. In general, there was no tangible mentoring relationship between masters and disciples at Cloud Sect. Only some special disciples could be taught by masters personally.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng didn't have to listen to Master Su. Her anger at Zheng's disobedience was due to her temperament.</p>

  <p>Master Su gritted her teeth as she glared at Zheng's resolute face in the picture slab again. After a few seconds, she left the pavilion and took a flying chariot to Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>On a peak of Hell Mountain, Yan sat on a rock and played with her slingshot. She was immersed in happy memories, and a sweet smile danced on her lips.</p>

  <p>Since her imprisonment on Hell Mountain, Yan had little else to do. Her childhood memories were her greatest treasure on such days.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a white light illuminated the mountain-side. Yan turned in the direction of the light.</p>

  <p>'Is Vale burning his life vitality? Is he fighting with someone?' Yan focused her eyes on the light and frowned.</p>

  <p>Although the distance was long, Yan was able to see every person on the mountain-side.</p>

  <p>First, she glanced at Vale. Then she moved her eyes from Vale to the man standing in front of Vale.</p>

  <p>'The man is in a white robe. Is he an outer disciple? Who dares to challenge Vale so boldly?' Yan wondered.</p>

  <p>When Yan saw the face of the outer disciple, her eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, the outer disciple was her beloved elder brother, Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Brother!" Yan couldn't help shouting though she knew that Zheng wouldn't be able to hear her from that distance.</p>

  <p>Even though she hadn't met Zheng in years, how could she forget her brother's appearance?</p>

  <p>'My brother is on Hell Mountain. What is he doing here? When did he arrive?</p>

  <p>My cousin, Perrin, did not tell me that Zheng was coming to Hell Mountain. Perrin didn't even mention that my brother is at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Why didn't he tell me?</p>

  <p>And what's happening between my brother and Vale?'</p>

  <p>Yan's mind filled with questions. However, she had no time to consider.</p>

  <p>The most pressing problem was that Zheng was confronting Vale who was at the Illuminating Soul Realm. As Zheng was just an outer disciple, the pressure of Vale's life vitality would kill him soon.</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, Yan became anxious and couldn't sit still.</p>

  <p>"No, no! Don't hurt my brother!" cried Yan.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating, she jumped down.</p>

  <p>The moment Yan jumped off the cliff, an energy junction connected by several hexagons appeared under her.</p>

  <p>The energy junction quickly formed a semi-circular wall that blocked Yan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! The six-pointed star array!"</p>

  <p>Yan shouted in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Yan knew that a six-pointed star array constrained her on Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>Since Yan had never thought of escaping she had never actively triggered the six-pointed star array before. At a time of crisis, she did not expect to be stopped by the array.</p>

  <p>Yan glanced at Vale and Zheng again nervously. Since he was just an outer disciple, Zheng couldn't hold on for long. She had no choice but to rescue her brother.</p>

  <p>"I'm gonna tear it apart," said Yan with a determined look.</p>

  <p>After a deep breath, Yan focused her energy on her fingertips. Then she stretched her long, slender fingers and poked the hexagonal energy junction.</p>

  <p>Although it seemed as though her action was gentle, she had actually used a tremendous amount of power.</p>

  <p>"Kirik!"</p>

  <p>The three connected hexagons broke up at once after Yan's action.</p>

  <p>However, the six-pointed star array was a very strong defensive array.</p>

  <p>As soon as it had broken, another three hexagons formed, which blocked the gap immediately.</p>

  <p>'Darn it! What shall I do?' Yan thought with despair.</p>

  <p>She was absolutely frantic by now.</p>

  <p>With no other alternatives, Yan repeatedly tried to break the array.</p>

  <p>However, the six-pointed star array repaired itself again and again.</p>

  <p>No matter how many times Yan tried, the energy emitted by the array didn't diminish. It seemed as though the array could repeat this cycle endlessly. This situation baffled Yan as she had no way to free herself and aid Zheng.</p>

  <p>All this while, Zheng stood rooted in his spot. He calmly faced the enormous pressure from Vale. Even though an ordinary disciple would have been crushed, Zheng stood erect with no sign of yielding.</p>

  <p>Zheng realized this kind of pressure had gone beyond the scope of life energy. It was even stronger than the life vitality of a nature creature.</p>

  <p>'Vale is only releasing a small amount of pressure. And yet, I am having trouble enduring this pressure. He may have surpassed the level of nature creatures, ' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know that Vale was a strong cultivator at the Illuminating Soul Realm until now.</p>

  <p>"Have you not realized the gap in the strength between you and me? I can kill you with just one finger. Despite my power, it's challenging for me to rescue Yan from Hell Mountain, let alone you. You can't even get to the top of the Hell Mountain. It's funny that you are so self-righteous,"</p>

  <p>Vale teased Zheng.</p>

  <p>Several pink lotuses bloomed and withered at Vale's feet, as though in an endless cycle, as he spoke.</p>
