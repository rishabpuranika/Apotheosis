  <p>
</p>

  <p>As for the tomb keeper, the battle of the Warden race had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>He was just a bystander at most.</p>

  <p>And considering his position and real strength, the Warden race had no right to ask him to fight on their behalf.</p>

  <p>He had been imprisoned here for a long time and had failed to explore the secret of the tombstone and win the bet. His days here had been a downright bore.</p>

  <p>As such, he accepted the invitation of the old head of the Warden race just because he wanted something to do.</p>

  <p>Even if all the people of the Warden race died miserable deaths in front of him, he would not be sad in the slightest.</p>

  <p>"Got it." The head of the Warden race nodded.</p>

  <p>Although he knew how powerful the tomb keeper was, he was also clear that he could not pin all his hopes on an outsider who had nothing to lose.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he was exhausted, both physically and mentally.</p>

  <p>He thought that it was perhaps time for him to put the battle between his race and the invaders to an end.</p>

  <p>Six hours later...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his companions were slowly walking along a dark road.</p>

  <p>The air around them was filled with a strange color. Led by Zelda, they turned a corner and saw a disk with a blue light flashing in the distance.</p>

  <p>"That is the Equality Altar," said Zelda as she looked at it.</p>

  <p>Beside the Equality Altar was a light blue stone tablet.</p>

  <p>This stone tablet was none other than the Pray Tablet that she had mentioned earlier. The grace that the Warden race enjoyed befell from it.</p>

  <p>If Zelda and Luther managed to get closer to the Pray Tablet, they would also be able to enjoy the grace of Herbert.</p>

  <p>"Will the effect of the Strength Equalizing token disappear if we destroy the Equality Altar?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Hearing his question, all the other exiles immediately pricked up their ears, waiting for an answer.</p>

  <p>This was what they were most concerned about.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Strength Equalizing token, any one of them, even the weakest one, could defeat the Warden race at will.</p>

  <p>Having their strength equalized had made all of them feel deep discomfort as they itched to fight with their true power.</p>

  <p>After all, all of the exiles were powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm, but many of them had been killed by the Warden race. How could they tolerate such an insult?</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zelda confirmed with a nod.</p>

  <p>Anyway, although the Equality Altar was close at hand, the rest of the Warden race would be guarding it desperately, so it would definitely not be easy to destroy.</p>

  <p>After they walked another half a mile, they came face to face with people in black robes who continuously spilled out the sides of the square, forming a barrier and effectively blocking their way.</p>

  <p>An old man stepped out from the barrier, holding a crooked black crutch in his hand.</p>

  <p>At the end of his crutch was a blue light that continuously flashed.</p>

  <p>"Sir..."</p>

  <p>Zelda came to a halt.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others also stopped behind her.</p>

  <p>"Zelda..." The leader of the Warden race looked at her with a complicated expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Warden race didn't have many members, so they were all familiar with one another. Like a small tribe, they had carefully managed this world by relying on one another.</p>

  <p>Before the conservative faction and the free faction broke up, Zelda had been very popular among the elders.</p>

  <p>Back then, even the leader of the Warden race had taken good care of her.</p>

  <p>However, when the disputes between the two factions had become more and more complicated, the situation had gone out of control and the factions had gradually gone to the point of being dead enemies.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Zelda said, lowering her head.</p>

  <p>She had no choice but to take revenge, but at the same time, she also felt guilty. This ambivalence had been torturing her ever since she entered this world.</p>

  <p>Luther, on the other hand, was much luckier.</p>

  <p>After all, he wasn't nearly as acquainted with the Warden race. Since they had made him and his sister wander from place to place, he had just taken them as his enemies.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to apologize," the leader of the Warden race said calmly.</p>

  <p>"I've thought about it a lot. Maybe you were right back then; maybe our persistence was just a joke."</p>

  <p>Only after the conversation with the tomb keeper had him realized that the prison they were in was not unique.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it did seem that their master had given up this place.</p>

  <p>Initially, it had been hard for him to accept what the mad guy had said, but on second thought, he had realized that it made sense.</p>

  <p>If their master really cared about this place, why hadn't he just killed all these intruders with his power?</p>

  <p>And if he really had abandoned this place, what was the point of the Warden race's persistence?</p>

  <p>So, the decision of the free faction had been right all along.</p>

  <p>"Sir..."</p>

  <p>Zelda was surprised.</p>

  <p>She had never expected that the old man would say such things.</p>

  <p>"But since we have come this far, we don't want to give up," the leader of the Warden race continued resolutely. "Maybe we, the insignificant wardens, are destined to be like this. Even though our master has already abandoned us, we still have to sacrifice our most humble lives for his sake." The old man looked at Zelda, and then at Luther, who was standing behind her. With a complicated smile, he said, "If you win, you must live on. You will be the last remaining bloodline of our Warden race."</p>

  <p>The leader of the Warden race knew that their race was not a great race; it was far inferior to the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>However, he still hoped to see their bloodline continue. In the future, this would perhaps be the last trace of their race's existence in this world.</p>

  <p>"All the members of the Warden race, listen to me. You are not allowed to attack Zelda and Luther," the leader of the Warden race then ordered the clansmen behind him.</p>

  <p>"Why?" The cloaked man with purple hair stepped forward. He didn't understand why the leader was issuing such an order. How could they hope to win a fight if they couldn't attack two of their opponents?</p>

  <p>"Do as I say," the leader of the Warden race said calmly.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated for a while, but in the end, he chose to be silent. In the Warden race, the old man's word was final.</p>

  <p>Then, the old man raised his crutch with his wrinkled hands. As the blue light on his crutch continued to flash, all the people in black robes behind him also raised their weapons.</p>

  <p>Tears fell from Zelda's eyes as she began sobbing. She could no longer tell what was right and what was wrong. She only felt sorry for the fate of her own race.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw this scene, his expression became rather complicated.</p>

  <p>The truth was, he didn't want to attack these people.</p>

  <p>But just as the old man had said, they had already come this far; how could they choose to retreat at this stage?</p>

  <p>The old man hit the ground heavily with his crutch, and at once, the people in black robes charged forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was supposed to give an order in response, but he kept silent, still hesitating.</p>

  <p>Emily glanced at Luo Zheng and slightly shook her head. It seemed that Luo Zheng was still too young.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she gently waved her hand and ordered, "Fight!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The exiles also charged forward at once.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Equality Altar, the tomb keeper slowly walked over and shook his head at the scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>Then, he took out two inconspicuous black knives from behind him.</p>

  <p>When he held them in his hands, there was a dramatic change in his temperament.</p>

  <p>The cynical look on his face disappeared, replaced by fierceness as he slowly swaggered forward.</p>
