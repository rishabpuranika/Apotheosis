<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2623 Cold-blooded </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This kind of situation not only happened in the territory of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>There were countless Wild Gods in the Nine Li race, Star Deer race and other main races that were instigated by the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>However, for the Yellow Emperor race, the Snake Goddess race was their ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>Under the Torrent Bone Tower, about ten million people had activated the Wild God Power. They transformed themselves into figures of a few thousand or tens of thousands of feet high. They all piled up and formed into a layer of wall, blocking the entrance of the bone tower completely.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of the Torrent Bone Tower, six elders from the Snake Goddess race were fiercely guarding the place.</p>

  <p>"How could this be even possible? Who has spread the news of Light of Adjudication?" an old woman with a hunch back exclaimed angrily.</p>

  <p>Previously, before the Light of Adjudication descended, a small number of Wild Gods would try to break into the bone towers, but it would be dozens or hundreds of people at the most. Depending on the situation, the Snake Goddess race would either selectively chose a part of them to let them stay or mercilessly just kill them all.</p>

  <p>But this time, things were different. All the Wild Gods in the territory of the Snake Goddess race were present.</p>

  <p>Now the situation became more complicated.</p>

  <p>Even though the Torrent Bone Tower was considerably large, it was difficult to accommodate so many Wild Gods!</p>

  <p>"Someone is deliberately spreading the news. We are yet to make out the intentions for the attempt," an astonished female elder commented.</p>

  <p>"What can be their purpose?" asked another woman coolly.</p>

  <p>The former lady snorted coldly. "Isn't it clear? Their reason could be the two people from the Warden race."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race had accepted those two people, fully aware of the consequences that they would have to face. It was as good as announcing a war on the Warden race.</p>

  <p>However, they assumed that the real confrontation would come only after the Light of Adjudication descended. They never expected that they would use such tricks before that!</p>

  <p>"That cannot be possible. The Warden race obviously doesn't have so many people. Is it even possible for them to instigate so many people in such a short time?" the enchanting female elder commented with a tinge of doubt.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Warden race rarely revealed themselves to others. They were always mysterious, so it would be difficult for them to convince so many people in a short time.</p>

  <p>As the elders continued to speculate, a circle of light, resembling a rainbow appeared behind them. Emily's voice faintly floated over. "This is not the deed done by the Warden race."</p>

  <p>"Master!"</p>

  <p>"Master!"</p>

  <p>The female elders bowed down to Emily with reverence.</p>

  <p>Emily nodded slightly and looked at the dense crowd of Wild Gods with a puzzled look.</p>

  <p>"If it is not the Warden race who instigated these people, who did it?" the old lady asked.</p>

  <p>The crystal light in Emily's eyes flashed. With a sneer she said, "Not all the races were invited by us. For example, the Yellow Emperor race is excluded."</p>

  <p>"Master, do you mean to say that this is the doing of the Yellow Emperor race?" the old lady asked in bafflement.</p>

  <p>The other elders present were equally stunned with Emily's claim. The elder with a cool expression asked, "Is the Yellow Emperor race trying to court death?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race was the most powerful race in this world, and no race dared to provoke them so far. Even the Yellow Emperor race was no match for the Snake Goddess race. That was why all the elders were shocked at this revelation. The consequences of provoking the Snake Goddess race could be imagined.</p>

  <p>"The Nine Li race doesn't allow the Yellow Emperor race to join our escape plan. Under this situation, if the Warden race gives them an olive branch, what will you do if you were in their place?" Emily asked.</p>

  <p>These elders immediately understood what happened.</p>

  <p>This was actually a counter attack from the Warden race, but they used the Yellow Emperor race as their pawn.</p>

  <p>"In fact, not only the Yellow Emperor race, but even some small races who did not join us, are likely to help the Warden race. Their ultimate goal is the two people from the Warden race."</p>

  <p>While speaking, Emily had a gleam in her eyes. "Luo Zheng is right. I have been looking forward to the Warden race's counterattack!"</p>

  <p>The elders were bewildered hearing Emily's comment.</p>

  <p>The old lady asked, "Why do you say that, master?"</p>

  <p>Emily asked, "If Luther and Zelda are on our side, but the Warden race do nothing about it, what do you think the reason can be?"</p>

  <p>The old lady thought for a while, then her eyes suddenly lit up. "It means that Luther and Zelda are of little significance for them!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. If they did nothing, it must mean that Luther and Zelda are hardly of any help for us to leave this world. Hence the Warden race wouldn't care about them at all. That is the most terrible situation to be in."</p>

  <p>As Emily spoke, she gently stepped forward and continued, "But now that the Warden race have allied with the Yellow Emperor race, along with the smaller races, it must mean that they are now afraid. At the same time, it also means that Luther and Zelda have the ability to help us leave this world!"</p>

  <p>"Then how do we deal with these Wild Gods?" the old lady asked.</p>

  <p>Emily shook her head and said, "It's very likely that the Yellow Emperor race have arranged certain people to lurk among these Wild Gods. Their ultimate goal is to enter the bone tower. And we can't let them achieve that."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Every time Emily moved about, a rainbow hued ripple would spread from the tip of her feet, producing a faint buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>At the same time as the ripples spread, her body also doubled in size.</p>

  <p>By merely taking a few dozen steps, she became a humongous Wild God, towering at five million feet tall. She looked down at the dense crowds of the Wild Gods and spoke in a cold and clear voice, "Everyone should immediately leave our Torrent Bone Tower as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it will be your doomsday!"</p>

  <p>The old lady and several other female elders were shocked at Emily's words. They looked at each other and took a deep breath. It was clearly evident that Emily was on a bloodbath mission.</p>

  <p>They were well aware that Emily had the potential and strength to kill so many Wild Gods, but they didn't expect her to really do so. There were over ten million warriors in this place!</p>

  <p>These several elders were born and grew up in this world after all.</p>

  <p>Although they regarded the Wild Gods as people of wilderness, it was still difficult for them to kill ten million living creatures.</p>

  <p>Emily and Timotheus, who were powerful warriors among the exiles, had already regarded ordinary creatures as weeds. In order to leave here, they wouldn't hesitate even if they were to kill ten times the number of people present.</p>

  <p>Until now, the Wild Gods who gathered, had a sliver of hope that the Snake Goddess race would be benevolent and allow them to stay in the Torrent Bone Tower. That was why, they didn't rush into the tower immediately.</p>

  <p>But now when they heard Emily speak, their hearts sank.</p>

  <p>"We belong to the territory of the Snake Goddess race!"</p>

  <p>"How can you bear to watch us die?"</p>

  <p>"I would rather be killed by you than be cleansed by the Light of Adjudication."</p>

  <p>These people knew their fate, but who would be willing to accept it?</p>

  <p>Sounds of begging, shouting, and roaring reverberated in the air. The whole place was in chaos.</p>

  <p>There were rage and disappointment among the people. Everyone present were torn between emotions.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew who took the lead, but suddenly some of them rushed towards the entrance of the Torrent Bone Tower, and more Wild Gods followed.</p>

  <p>All the Wild Gods united as a force and dashed towards the Torrent Bone Tower behind Emily like a torrent.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the changing scene down below, Emily slightly shook her head and sighed, "Don't blame me for being cold-blooded then."</p>
