  <p>
</p>

  <p>The demon women from the Divine Lair of the Sun Crow race all had a pair of huge sprawling wings.</p>

  <p>Flamine and Feng Ge were as beautiful as those demon women, but they didn't have wings.</p>

  <p>This sudden encounter with Feng Ge's mother had made Zheng uncomfortable and was creating a little trouble for him.</p>

  <p>Looking at a stunned Zheng, Flamine calmly instructed, "Follow me. I'll take you there."</p>

  <p>She entered through the palace gate as she spoke, gliding with graceful steps and dragging purple ribbons behind her.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated a moment before deciding to follow her in.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had many children, and the Phoenix Palace was quite large and magnificent.</p>

  <p>They came across very few people as they walked. Any guards and maids they saw knelt and saluted Flamine respectfully.</p>

  <p>They walked along a tall red wall for some minutes when Zheng turned and was faced with a gigantic palace gate. Just before it stood a triangular bronze furnace. In it, flames flickered and jet out in spurts and a faint golden light glowed from within.</p>

  <p>"This is the divine flame of the Sun Crow race," Zheng pointed out in surprise, raising his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>Flamine walked just ahead of Zheng, but she was stunned when she heard him and turned back to look at him. "You know the flame?"</p>

  <p>"I have been to the Mountain Viewing Province. There I saw... I saw the demon women and such flames," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>He had intended to tell her he had seen Elizabeth then. But after considering the link between Flamine and Feng Ge and the Divine Lair, he changed his mind, afraid that Flamine would ask many questions.</p>

  <p>Flamine pointed lightly at the bronze furnace. A divine flame flew from the furnace, turning into a small fire bird and rushing to Flamine. It then stopped when it reached her and settled itself on her sleeve.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know what material her beautiful purple dress was made of but she clearly was not afraid of the burning of the divine flame.</p>

  <p>The fire bird stayed in her hand for a short while and then snapped into a wisp of flame. It hissed and entered her mouth horrifyingly. Flamine had swallowed the divine flame!</p>

  <p>She spoke as she swallowed, "The Sun Crow race was born in the divine flames, and their blood power is hidden in them. Even the demon women born in the Divine Lair can't live without the divine flames."</p>

  <p>She had just admitted she was a nonhuman creature from the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the bronze furnace was there to produce endless divine flames for her and Feng Ge to devour as they required.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the divine flame, she stepped through the huge palace gate, followed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered the palace gate, two maids dressed in blue hurriedly came to them.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine," the maids in blue greeted, kowtowing to Flamine.</p>

  <p>"Is Feng Ge in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace?" asked Flamine.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is," one of the maids in blue answered respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Take me to her," commanded Flamine.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lady Flamine."</p>

  <p>The two maids in blue led the way dutifully.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Cultivation Palace was a place for cultivation in the Phoenix Palace. Along the way, there were four tall towers and some other large buildings, from which a strong energy could be felt emitting.</p>

  <p>A short while later, the maids had brought them to the Fire Bearing Hall in the innermost circle of the palace.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamine, please wait here. I'll let Princess Feng Ge know you are here." The maid in blue kowtowed to Flamine once more before scurrying into the Fire Bearing Hall.</p>

  <p>Zheng was growing impatient. The Phoenix Palace was like the royal palace of the divine kingdom. There were too many formalities.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Zheng didn't have to wait much more.</p>

  <p>Before long, Feng Ge appeared at the gate of the Fire Bearing Hall. "Mother, what can I do for you?" she asked exacerbating and impatient.</p>

  <p>Flamine smiled and said, "Nothing for me, but Mr. Luo wants to see you."</p>

  <p>"Who is Mr. Luo?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge raised her head and saw Zheng standing close by. A fierce look flashed in her eyes.</p>

  <p>As the direct descendant of the Oneness Mountain, she was fate's favored one. Her parents spoiled her very much, and she was regarded quite highly among her peers.</p>

  <p>Even her brothers and sisters didn't dare to cross her.</p>

  <p>She lost to Zheng at the Seven Mountains Meeting, and even worse, he humiliated her to her face. This enraged her massively and she could not let it go.</p>

  <p>"Look at you," she said with condescending surprise. "You actually came right to the Phoenix Palace. Who brought you here, Athemar or Goran?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge sneered, one eyebrow raised.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened with anger as he barked, "It doesn't matter how I got in.</p>

  <p>Where are Nelly, Liusu and Xun? I will get them back!"</p>

  <p>He had no idea as to where they were or whether they were safe or not. He'd been worrying about them all this time and all the way here.</p>

  <p>A triumphant smile graced Feng Ge's frigid face as she saw the concern drawn across Zheng's face. "They are enduring the Soul Fire Swirl, so I will not give them to you. If you want them back, you have to go through me first!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea what the Soul Fire Swirl was. But it sounded to him like a cruel punishment.</p>

  <p>Rage burned from his heart throughout his entire being.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He kicked off the ground and was gone in a flash, rushing at Feng Ge in complete disregard of Flamine.</p>

  <p>Flamine was close enough to have stopped Zheng if she wanted. But she saw the expressions on her daughter's face before she moved and decided to just stand aside and let this be.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge laughed scornfully at Zheng charging at her. "I may have lost to you at the Seven Mountains Meeting, but that was not a competition of real strength. You just took advantage of the Truth Enlightenment. Do you really think you're powerful enough for this?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's hand was already moving at breakneck speed to grab her when she was done speaking.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyes overflowed with hatred in the face of Zheng's grab. She stretched out her hand and gave it a gentle wave.</p>

  <p>Thanks to her unique body, her slender hand was able to unleash three to four hundred divine megatons of force. Even Marco and Konnor couldn't withstand this gentle wave.</p>

  <p>But when she touched Zheng's arm, the color disappeared from her face. She realized immediately that she had got it all wrong.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if Zheng's right hand was made of fine steel, and the power that he unleashed was beyond her imagination. He grabbed her, swung his arm over his head, and slammed her into the ground behind him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The floor was cracked and near destroyed from the impact.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge appeared almost buried.</p>

  <p>If it were Marco who had been thrown, he would have been seriously hurt if not dead. However, there were indistinct fire textures on the surface of Feng Ge's body, and she appeared unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Tell me! Where are they?"</p>

  <p>Zheng snarled mercilessly.</p>

  <p>If Feng Ge didn't tell him the whereabouts of his wives, he would kill her right in front of her mother.</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground, Feng Ge opened her eyes wide as she looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>She could not believe how Zheng treated her. She had never been treated this way in her life.</p>

  <p>She snapped back to reality and her irritation returned with her.</p>

  <p>She raised her head and sniggered, "As I said, if you want to know their whereabouts, defeat me first."</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, two golden lights suddenly materialized in her hands.</p>

  <p>A golden sun appeared in her right hand, and a golden moon appeared in her left.</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes and slapped both hands into the ground firmly.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A huge stone statue had appeared before Zheng.</p>

  <p>The stone statue had a strange shape. It had sixteen arms in total, and fifteen of them were on its left side. There was only one on the right.</p>

  <p>The moment it appeared, it thrust its only right arm at Zheng.</p>
