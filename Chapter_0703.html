  <p>
</p>

  <p>"W-what?!" Luo Luo Zheng was shocked with the sudden knowledge he had gained.</p>

  <p>He didn't know. And if he knew, he wouldn't have used it!</p>

  <p>The dragons were the supreme beings of the universe. They had power and authority over anything. They could even be considered as gods of this world.</p>

  <p>If the cyan dragon and the red dragon hadn't gotten into such a plight, the possibility of them destroying the universe with one wave of their claws was not far from reality. The world and the Central Region would be in utter devastation. But thankfully, they did not cause such a ruckus.</p>

  <p>The mighty dragon valued the primordial energy, but at first, Luo Luo Zheng used it to cleanse his body only. Moreover, after becoming a nature creature, he didn't practice body refining skills, so he used the primordial energy to wash the body, but unfortunately, the effect was not satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's mouth was agape, left speechless by the revelation. He couldn't fathom out what to say or what to do. He was dumbfounded and lost on what should be done next.</p>

  <p>"However, I have heard from my brother that you woke me up at the cost of your life, and for that, I owe you. To pay my debt, I can teach you body refining skills. But let me warn you. I have never supported human body refining. But your body is unique! It will be a waste not to refine it. The only question left is, will you be able to do it?" the red dragon asked in an emotionless voice. The Genuine Dragon World had many humans in it, but most of them were Dragon Lineage Humans with dragon blood.</p>

  <p>These humans who had dragon blood in their bodies were far stronger and superior than a normal human being when it came to body refining skills.</p>

  <p>But normal human beings were naturally suitable for the practice of life vitality system, and that included the refinement of the body. A lot of them at first opted to refine their bodies. However, the most powerful people relied on the life vitality system since it could lengthen a life span.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes shone with determination as he held the dragon's gaze, "I won't give up, no matter how difficult it is."</p>

  <p>Giving up wasn't an option for Luo Luo Zheng, especially since he still wanted to rescue his sister. He might have been strong. But it was not enough to protect Yan. She got taken away from his care in just an instant. Other than that, a part of him also wanted to pursue the consummate martial arts. He had to make himself stronger until he reached the absolute peak.</p>

  <p>"Impressive," the red dragon said. "That's a good start! You'll need your strongest conviction. Your determination and the strength of your body are needed for you to succeed with me. Let's start with refining your body," the dragon added.</p>

  <p>"Refine my body?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously. "I have reached the nature level by refining my body."</p>

  <p>Before reaching the nature level, there was a need for warriors to practice body refining skills in order to remove the impurities in their bodies. They had to refine their skin, flesh, bones, organs, and marrows in the exact succession. Back in the day, Luo Luo Zheng had used the precious primordial energy to force out the impurities within his body.</p>

  <p>"After reaching the nature level, the primordial energy in your body does not work at all. Except for a small part that has now disappeared, the rest of it continues to flow and spread all throughout your body. You often wash the belly with it, so it is concentrated there. I will use it to refine your body first. Forget the body refining you knew before." The red dragon was obviously against the body refining skills of the Eastern Region where Luo Luo Zheng had practiced. 'I'm skeptical about it, since it is quite pathetic, ' the dragon wanted to add while talking to Luo Luo Zheng, but he shoved the idea away since it was not worth to be commented on.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the red dragon viewed the Purple Light Fist he had learned before as complete trash, and he was perfectly okay with it. The warm currents he felt after he was beaten earlier were exactly his primordial energy, but he didn't use it well.</p>

  <p>After he reached the nature level, the warm currents generated after he was beaten were the primordial energy he never used. Over time, he had built up a considerable amount of primordial energy. Now, the red dragon was fully intended on using it to refine his body.</p>

  <p>"I am warning you once again. The refinement will be very painful and hard. I advise you to be prepared for it," the dragon warned before Luo Luo Zheng could quit his meditation. Luo Zheng's soul just nodded as an acknowledgement.</p>

  <p>He was prepared for whatever it was going to take.</p>

  <p>As the brave warrior came back from his reverie, he squinted his eyes slowly and shook his head. He breathed once more to fully restore his consciousness. After that, he decided to step out and into the courtyard. The Martial Arts Contest was held nearby, so the rent of the courtyard he was in was very expensive. However, it was cheap for him since he had hundreds of supreme life vitality crystals to spend. He rented the whole courtyard that day, so no one could be seen aside from him wandering around that place.</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the space, he heard the red dragon began to speak,</p>

  <p>"I shall now commence with refining your body using the primordial energy." As soon as he finished his words, Luo Luo Zheng felt his entire body become rigid.</p>
