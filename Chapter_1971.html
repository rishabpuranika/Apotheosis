  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, Supreme Lord Lester was not able to think of anything else. All of his awareness was focused on the crisis before him and how they could avert it.</p>

  <p>Master Feng was sure that Luo Luo Zheng played an extremely special and important role in Mike's plan. Luo Luo Zheng would never have been restricted to just one part of the universe.</p>

  <p>Once a martial artist carried a Heavenly Destiny and became a Supreme Lord, their ability to leave the universe was lost. They were no longer allowed to travel where they pleased.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would have lost the capability to go to the divine land.</p>

  <p>But they had no choice. If they wanted to be able to solve the crisis posed by the Sacred race, it was better for Luo Luo Zheng to carry a Heavenly Destiny and become a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>It was not certain whether Luo Luo Zheng could really save the universe. Even if Luo Luo Zheng drove back the Sacred race to the Murphy Universe, it would have only solved their current crisis. It didn't mean that Luo Luo Zheng would be an all-powerful being that could save them from any predicament.</p>

  <p>The people in the Hall of Holy Beings of the divine land would never let Mike go.</p>

  <p>Now that Murphy had initiated an attack on the Evolutionary Universe, other Holy Beings might see their chance to break through the Sighing Wall and invade the Evolutionary Universe. It would have been an infinite war; Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't have been able to fight off so many Holy Beings' attacks even if he had three heads and six arms.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Master Feng's words, Supreme Lord Lester fell silent.</p>

  <p>Burdening Luo Luo Zheng with a Heavenly Destiny wouldn't indeed be the best solution.</p>

  <p>Once he was given a Heavenly Destiny, it would leave a mark behind.</p>

  <p>This mark was deeply engraved in one's soul, and it would never be removed. It also disqualified one from becoming a True God.</p>

  <p>"We'll discuss this matter in the future," Master Feng smiled as he addressed the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished talking, a voice suddenly quipped nearby, "I have a suggestion!"</p>

  <p>"Master Wynn!"</p>

  <p>"Master Wynn!".</p>

  <p>When they heard that voice, all the Supreme Lords adopted a respectful stance.</p>

  <p>Not far away, a figure approached. The old man was dressed in a long, immaculate white robe; his entire body was radiant and spotless, as if dust would be automatically repelled if it as much as brushed his garments. This was the only True God of the Celestial Position race, Wynn.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw Wynn, he also nodded his head in acknowledgment and bowed in greeting, "Master Wynn."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng entered the Celestial Position race for the first time in the past, he did not know their true intentions. A malicious suspicion even arose in his heart and he had a strong dislike for the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw Wynn, another realization made itself known in his mind.</p>

  <p>This True God Wynn was Mike's disciple, his father's disciple!</p>

  <p>If only these other Supreme Lords weren't here in the same room with them, Luo Luo Zheng would have really wanted to ask him what kind of person his father was. Luo Luo Zheng would have wanted to hear more stories about his father.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's memories of his father had gradually faded over time, but it was his father's harsh criticisms and lessons that still lingered in his heart.</p>

  <p>As one of the Holy Beings, he had another personality inside his own body. He was a compassionate father who mentored Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng also had conflicting feelings towards his "father". On one hand, Mike was a superior Holy Being; on the other hand, he was a kind father. Which one of them was real? It was hard for Luo Luo Zheng to distinguish clearly between them now.</p>

  <p>Wynn looked at Luo Luo Zheng understandingly and asked him, "Do you still remember that Crown of Destiny?"</p>

  <p>"Crown of Destiny?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately nodded his head. How could he forget about the Crown of Destiny?</p>

  <p>Back then, this Crown of Destiny was the reason why Luo Luo Zheng was surrounded by many Supreme Lords in the universe.</p>

  <p>But he didn't have the qualifications to carry the Crown of Destiny yet then; the minimum requirement was to become at least a world lord. At that time, Luo Zheng's cultivation level was too low.</p>

  <p>"You mean that Crown of Destiny!" Master Feng's eyes immediately lit up in delight.</p>

  <p>The Crown of Destiny in Luo Zheng's possession was passed on down from the last grand era, which meant that it was the 129th Heavenly Destiny in the universe.</p>

  <p>The Crown of Destiny was still kept safely in Luo Zheng's Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Wynn nodded, and then said, "When the last grand era was eliminated, there was a Supreme Lord who wanted to escape the annihilation. Just as he was about to die, I saved his life, and also kept his Crown of Destiny in return."</p>

  <p>Contrary to popular belief, Supreme Lords' lifespans were limited. Some Supreme Lords could live for up to 300 million years, but they still weren't able to resist the passage of time. There would eventually be a day when they succumbed to the erosion caused by aging.</p>

  <p>Wynn's purpose in saving that Supreme Lord was to keep the Crown of Destiny. And this Crown of Destiny was meant for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You... You saved that Supreme Lord?!" Luo Luo Zheng was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Wynn nodded.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had first entered the Reincarnation Plate, he'd also been rather curious about some things.</p>

  <p>A grand era's cycle was 3.6 billion years. After that, the heavens would collapse and all forms of life would go extinct.</p>

  <p>From Supreme Lords to ordinary mortals, not a single living being was able to escape being annihilated. That was the way of the universe.</p>

  <p>What was so special about this Supreme Lord that he was able to survive safely by hiding in the Reincarnation Plate?</p>

  <p>Livingston also survived together with that Supreme Lord. However, because Livingston only had a puppet body now, he could no longer be fully considered a living being. He was able to continue his life from the last round of the heavens until now. But that Supreme Lord still succumbed into the Five Aging Processes and died.</p>

  <p>"The round of heavens that the Heavenly Destiny once belonged to has been destroyed already; that was different from the current round of heavens now. You can carry that Crown of Destiny and it won't leave a mark on you. Don't worry, it won't affect your ability to cross the heavens in the future," Wynn said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>When they heard this, everyone present including Luo Luo Zheng, couldn't help but sigh in amazement. Mike's plan was quite well thought out. He had probably foreseen it all since tens of billions of years ago.</p>

  <p>The only thing he was wrong about was when Murphy would have attacked the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race's invasion had been advanced by nearly three hundred years.</p>

  <p>A few hundred years seemed like a big error, but for a span of tens of billions of years, his speculation was already quite accurate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's interest in the Crown of Destiny was also renewed. He nodded towards Wynn with a smile and said, "Then I'll go get that Crown of Destiny now!"</p>

  <p>After some thought, Luo Luo Zheng turned to Master Feng and said, "My friends are still in the Immortal Mansion and they won't be able to adapt to the Vitality Pressure in the Upper World. I wonder if there are any ways to get them used to it."</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded and replied, "This won't be too much of a problem.</p>

  <p>Sky, go help Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>A short time later, Luo Luo Zheng led Supreme Lord Sky to the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>After they had been waiting at the entrance of the Immortal Mansion for a while, the martial artists of the Celestial Position race came flying over.</p>

  <p>The leading martial artist held a small purple gold bottle in his hand.</p>

  <p>The group of martial artists were puzzled. The contents of this bottle were only for the martial artists from the Lower World to adapt to the vitality between heaven and earth. Why would they have to deliver it to Supreme Lord Sky in person?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sky took the bottle and passed it to Luo Luo Zheng. He said, "This bottle is filled with Dust Cleaning Pills. The warriors themselves should adapt to the difference in the pressure of vitality between heaven and earth. We cannot change their bodies. However, the Dust Cleaning Pill can neutralize one's surrounding vitality between heaven and earth, and after eating this Dust Cleaning Pill, they will be able to walk in the Upper World for a period of time."</p>

  <p>"How long will this Dust Cleaning Pill last?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sky smiled and said, "The Dust Cleaning Pills are high-grade pills. One Dust Cleaning Pill should last for about thirty years."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had thought that it would be enough if this pill could last for a few dozen hours. He was speechless when he heard that it could last for thirty years.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race was really powerful. He extended his hand to take the bottle of the Dust Cleaning Pills and stepped into the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian, Imogen and many people from the Cloud Hall had been waiting for a long time.</p>

  <p>They had been cooped up in the Immortal Mansion for many years. The environment of the Immortal Mansion was good enough, but to them, it was like a prison.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng brought out the Dust Cleaning Pills and distributed them into everyone's hands. After everyone had eaten it, Luo Luo Zheng headed out to acquire the Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>The moment that Luo Zheng's hand touched the Crown of Destiny, the entire heavens suddenly trembled!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Celestial Position race were not surprised.</p>

  <p>They knew that Luo Luo Zheng had touched the Crown of Destiny, but the other Supreme Lords in the universe all looked up at the sky in surprise, wondering why the heavens were shaking again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to endure this kind of shock. There was a connection between the Crown of Destiny and the heavens. It immediately started to shake once he wasn't paying attention.</p>

  <p>After he took out the Crown of Destiny, Luo Luo Zheng left the Immortal Mansion with Luo Nian and the others.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was bored in the Immortal Mansion; he could only use his talent to decipher the golden Sanskrit. However, he was still an eleven-year-old child and was filled with curiosity towards this world.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng released them, he was naturally elated. He almost jumped up in excitement as he looked up at the Breaking Cloud Mountain, which was like a giant crystal.</p>
