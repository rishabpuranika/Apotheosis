  <p>
</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Since it was the most important building of the Demon Night race, the Inauguration Altar naturally had many defenses.</p>

  <p>It was very difficult to infiltrate it from the outside.</p>

  <p>However, due to the pressure of that massive force, Luo Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Shadow found themselves falling directly onto the thick, stone floor of the altar.</p>

  <p>The altar was built from solid, cyan stone cut three-hundred feet high and three-hundred feet wide. Its surface was intricately carved and gave it a tougher constitution.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to pierce through the thick, cyan stone so Luo Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Shadow merely created two large holes and embedded themselves within.</p>

  <p>While inside the hole, Luo Luo Zheng turned and saw two women standing at the far end of the Inauguration Altar. One was in blue, the other in green.</p>

  <p>These two were slender and had well-proportioned bodies. They looked extremely beautiful, but their temperaments were totally different. The one in blue had high cheekbones that gave her a fierce, domineering look.</p>

  <p>The green one had a gentler face compared to her.</p>

  <p>"Yao... Ying..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng murmured in distaste. He didn't think these two would get here so fast.</p>

  <p>They had fought against him before. Yao almost got involved in the Desperate Melee activated by Luo Luo Zheng back then. Fortunately for her, Supreme Lord Gunter was the one who bit the dust during that event.</p>

  <p>As for Ying... She had initially participated in the Illusion Battlefield as "Shania" and displayed the power of the tenth layer of Life Law, shocking the entire universe's Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't treated her as an enemy back then, but the Celestial Position race thought differently. They were on guard against her from the start and quickly eliminated her from the ten Godly Geniuses. It was these two women, under the orders of the Soul-sealing Needles, that led the Demon Night race on this path.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng managed to kill Supreme Lord Shadow, then he could join forces with Supreme Lord Leroy and completely reverse the situation. He'd be able to enter the Inauguration Altar to destroy the Pools of Faith.</p>

  <p>Who would've guessed that these two women would appear at the worst possible moment? This was going to be extremely troublesome.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow and Supreme Lord Korbin were already hard enough to deal with; what was even worse was that these two queens of the Demon Night race also joined the battle.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was in a bad mood, Supreme Lord Leroy was practically fuming.</p>

  <p>Luck didn't seem to be on their side. The intervention of the two Demon Night Supreme Lords slowed down his movements and it had been too late when he saw Ying and Yao.</p>

  <p>However, they weren't about to give up just yet.</p>

  <p>'Kill Supreme Lord Shadow first!' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow was in terrible condition given how many punches Luo Luo Zheng threw at him. He no longer had the strength to resist when Luo Luo Zheng pulled him out of the hole.</p>

  <p>However, Ying raised her head. Her eyes were jade-green as if they were blossomed with lush flower petals and brimmed with rich life energy. A green beam of light then shot towards Supreme Lord Shadow and filled his body with life.</p>

  <p>Ying's comprehension of the Life Law was unrivalled in the entire universe. Nobody could compare to her since she was the only one who comprehended the tenth-layer Life Law, the perfect Life Law, without carrying a Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe's Life Law was created by Holy Mike which meant that Ying had completely inherited his understanding of Life Law.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow was on the brink of death when Luo Luo Zheng pulled him to his side. However, his wounds began to heal at a rapid pace because of Ying's life energy.</p>

  <p>His internal organs were healing, his bones repairing, and all his broken veins recirculating as he was once again given life by the queen.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's Great Weighty Sword was already coming towards him.</p>

  <p>No amount of healing could ever save him from it.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The blade entered his stomach, piercing through his spine, before finally coming out of his back.</p>

  <p>"Twisting!"</p>

  <p>There was no hesitation on Luo Zheng's part. He was dead set on shattering Supreme Lord Shadow's fleshy body.</p>

  <p>If he didn't kill Supreme Lord Shadow, then the Death Chain would not be severed. Luo Luo Zheng knew his situation wasn't that ideal. If he failed, he wouldn't be able to hide in his Immortal Mansion. The Death Chain was a powerful weapon that could be used to bind the enemy. however, it was figuratively a double-edged sword. Once released, it would also lock the wielder.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Ying giggled and waved a slender finger. "The Link of Life!"</p>

  <p>Beams of green enveloped her entire body, the very same ones that rapidly healed Supreme Lord Shadow's injuries earlier.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Great Weighty Sword had already done its job of killing Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, a strange scene occurred.</p>

  <p>The powerful force of Luo Zheng's blade quickly tore Supreme Lord Shadow's body apart. His head, abdomen, and shoulders were all severed from each other.</p>

  <p>However, the Supreme Lord's Mu Ning did not weaken in the slightest and instead grew stronger.</p>

  <p>Despite the power of his blade, it seemed Luo Luo Zheng was unsuccessful in killing him!</p>

  <p>The broken flesh of the Supreme Lord looked extremely frightening but the green light from Ying merged all his limbs back together and made him whole again.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! The Link of Life is indeed powerful, my queen! As long as you are alive, then I also won't die. You are indeed powerful, you brat, but you're unable to kill me!" Supreme Lord Shadow sneered amidst the rubble.</p>

  <p>Ying's Link of Life was one of the mysteries of the ten-layer Life Law.</p>

  <p>She could choose any person in the world to link to her. That person, despite whatever injury he or she might suffer through, would heal and live while Ying herself was alive.</p>

  <p>Of course, this skill was not completely omnipotent. Ying's life energy was not limitless. If Luo Luo Zheng killed Supreme Lord Shadow multiple times, then he would continuously absorb the queen's life energy.</p>

  <p>However, this problem was effectively solved by the Pool of Faith from which Ying constantly replenished her life energy.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be only one solution: destroy the Pools of Faith.</p>

  <p>This was extremely troublesome.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew he might encounter some trouble in the Demon Night race. He was prepared to deal with any unforeseen circumstance that could delay his plans. However, he never thought that he might actually die from this.</p>

  <p>He couldn't break the Death Chain, he was unable to kill Supreme Lord Shadow, and now he had to face both Yao and Ying.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he was once again facing a life and death crisis.</p>

  <p>"I'm truly surprised that you two helped us deal with Luo Luo Zheng and Leroy.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred race occupies this universe in the future, I will help you obtain some benefits!" Yao promised to both Supreme Lord Shadow and Supreme Lord Korbin. She felt very much in control of the current situation and couldn't help but feel somewhat proud of herself.</p>

  <p>When they heard Supreme Lord Leroy issue the queen's order on behalf of Xun, both Ying and Yao immediately panicked.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy had been in hiding for so many years. With his return, the two queens had no doubt that he had a way to deal with them.</p>

  <p>If he destroyed their Pools of Faith, then their strengths would greatly weaken and fall into the level of an ordinary world lord.</p>

  <p>So, they hurriedly rushed back as fast as possible.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect two neutral Supreme Lords to actually come out and fight with both Luo Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Leroy as soon as they returned to the Rosy Cloud World.</p>

  <p>This made the two queens very happy. However, they didn't expect that Supreme Lord Shadow would be as helpless as a sandbag in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thus, they had to intervene.</p>

  <p>"No need to thank me. I did it for myself," Supreme Lord Korbin replied.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's eyes narrowed at the sight of Yao. His one hand was clutched tight around his bow and his fist was clenched around his three Blood-devouring Bone Arrows he had especially prepared or her.</p>

  <p>At that moment, countless thoughts ran through Luo Zheng's mind. This situation seemed like a dead end with no solution in sight.</p>

  <p>"I've let you live peacefully for many years, Leroy. I thought you'd be happy hiding in a corner to enjoy your old age. Why did you appear now?" Yao asked, walking towards him. Although her words were directed at Leroy, her brilliant eyes were fixated on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
