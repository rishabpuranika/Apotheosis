<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Curled up in the black light was the downgrader, elated to see the third-grade world slowly downgrade into the Wall World.</p>

  <p>It had been too depressing having lost to a human from the third-grade world.</p>

  <p>Now, he was hell-bent on revenge.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!</p>

  <p>The downgrading will only get faster and faster!</p>

  <p>I've already mastered all the Extreme Form energies. Not only will this third-grade world be disintegrated soon, so will the other third-grade worlds, the four-grade world and the fifth-grade world! They will all disintegrate into the Wall World!</p>

  <p>You losers will all die! You tiny ants… insects… derivatives…"</p>

  <p>As the downgrader muttered foul words, the Evil God stretched out his hand, shooting out a purple vine.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The purple vine pierced right through the black light, killing the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead and curse— that's all you can do. You have no power to fight back. You're the real loser," retorted the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As the black light slightly trembled, the downgrader was reborn along with it.</p>

  <p>He knew he was no match for the Evil God on his own, but with the black light infinitely reviving him, he still stood a chance.</p>

  <p>"After the downgrade, you will turn into nothingness! All of you will rot in history. Only I can live forever!</p>

  <p>Insignificant humans..."</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>The Evil God almost couldn't bear his annoyance.</p>

  <p>"You're too noisy for a downgrader! It's shameful! Shut the hell up!"</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Thin threads of ice appeared from the Evil God's hands, shooting into the black light.</p>

  <p>Once they entered, they curled up bit by bit, merging with the black light until they froze. frozen along with them was the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The ice threads came from the "Phase" energy of the tenth-grade world.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the downgrader could rely on his infinite energy to destroy the Phase energy, but it would undoubtedly take a very long time. For the time being, he couldn't curse.</p>

  <p>Once the Evil God sealed him off, his gaze fixated on the transparent thin sheet. Turning to Zheng, he asked, "Is it true that the downgrade can't be reversed?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, there is no solution." Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>Believing Zheng's words, the Evil God merely nodded. They had both fallen into the critical situation— Zheng had nothing to gain by lying.</p>

  <p>"What if I inject energy into the sheet?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>"You can give it a try."</p>

  <p>In the past, Clarence had used all sorts of methods to prevent the downgrade, all to no avail. Zheng didn't think the Evil God stood a chance at all.</p>

  <p>After a while, the Evil God reached out to touch the transparent thin sheet.</p>

  <p>The moment his fingers met the material, they were crushed by an overwhelming force.</p>

  <p>The nails, skin, bones, blood of his hand… all turned to a thin piece.</p>

  <p>He pulled his arm away immediately as though he felt no pain. Looking at his broken arm, he examined his flat nails, skin, and bones. "Are my fingers downgraded?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng affirmed.</p>

  <p>The scene reminded Zheng of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>There, Zheng had also become a picture— but it wasn't a real downgrade, only an imitation.</p>

  <p>The real downgrade was like the Evil God's fingers— as the very state of them changed, they had been completely downgraded from the third grade to the second grade.</p>

  <p>During this process, everything was destroyed. It was impossible for people to survive as a picture on the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>From this perspective, the downgrader was right. Once the downgrade began, everyone would eventually turn into nothingness.</p>

  <p>"The downgrade's power is very strong…but not necessarily stronger than mine!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God finished speaking, a terrifying amount of energy burst out from his arm.</p>

  <p>Layers upon layers of black energy covered the back of his hand, forming a carapace as thick as dragon scales.</p>

  <p>"That's the energy of the eleventh-grade world. There are four kinds of Frequency energy in the eleventh-grade world, all controlled by four respective races. This carapace is that of the Ghost Hand race— it has the strongest defensive power,"</p>

  <p>Clarence explained in Zheng's mind, getting active.</p>

  <p>"Can the carapace resist the downgrade?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No, it can't," Clarence affirmed.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Evil God once again extended his hand to reach for the transparent sheet.</p>

  <p>Woo! Woo! Woo!</p>

  <p>A sudden harsh sound was heard.</p>

  <p>The carapace on the Evil God's arm overlapped with the thin, transparent sheet.</p>

  <p>Its strength was quite astonishing. Even in the face of the overwhelming downgrading power, it still maintained its own shape, albeit lasting only two seconds.</p>

  <p>Bit by bit, the carapace twisted until it was quickly pressed into the Wall World by the downgrading power, along with half of the Evil God's arm.</p>

  <p>"Even the Frequency energy can't stop the downgrade…."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes narrowed slightly, his face turning hard with caution.</p>

  <p>A new hand rapidly grew from his broken arm.</p>

  <p>While the new hand didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary at first, it was formed from the energy of the twelfth-grade world.</p>

  <p>Only two kinds of energy remained in the twelfth-grade world— the "Creation Coke", and the 'Annihilation Coke".</p>

  <p>There was no limit to the two kinds of energy. The Creation Coke, for instance, could recklessly form the toughest material, just like the Evil God's hand.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>For about fifteen seconds in the transparent sheet, the hand held on. But it couldn't avoid its fate of being downgraded. With a cracking sound, the arm's surface began to disintegrate until it was pressed into the Wall World.</p>

  <p>The surprise was evident in the Evil God's eyes as his face went stiff.</p>

  <p>Was Zheng right? Was there really no way to stop the downgrade, he wondered?</p>

  <p>In such a short time, the transparent sheet had expanded about five to six times in diameter, reaching a hundred feet wide.</p>

  <p>Compared to the scale of the entire chaos, the width of a hundred feet was rather insignificant. But according to the downgrader, the speed of expansion would increase exponentially. They didn't have much time left.</p>

  <p>"Everything has a solution. There's nothing in the world I can't deal with!"</p>

  <p>Then, the Evil God used the Grand Teleportation to disappear.</p>

  <p>Still floating in the void, Zheng eventually used Grand Teleportation as well to return to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Neither the Snake Goddess nor the others in the fairy palace knew exactly how the battle was going. When Geoffrey saw his father, he went ahead and asked. "Father, what's happening now?"</p>

  <p>"The downgrader has already been sealed," Zheng replied. Everyone's faces lit up with joy upon hearing the answer, but Zheng's next words made their expressions freeze. "It's not me who sealed the downgrader. It was the Evil God."</p>

  <p>"The Evil God!"</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"The entire Source World was smashed to bits! How in the world does the Evil God still have the ability to do that?"</p>

  <p>The news left everyone confused.</p>

  <p>"His strength far surpasses mine… it even surpasses the strength of the downgrader," Zheng said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Everyone's jaws went slack with shock.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng's and the downgrader's powers were already something beyond their comprehension. To think that the Evil God could still far surpass them…just how powerful was he?</p>

  <p>And the Evil God had always been at odds with Zheng— if he was so powerful, then how could he have just let go of Zheng?</p>

  <p>"Didn't the Evil God attack you?" the Snake Goddess asked, finding it particularly odd.</p>

  <p>"No." Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked in return.</p>

  <p>Given the nature of the Evil God, it was simply unimaginable that he didn't attack Zheng at any opportune moment.</p>

  <p>"Because it would be meaningless. The world has already begun to downgrade. We're all going to die," Zheng replied, calm as ever.</p>
