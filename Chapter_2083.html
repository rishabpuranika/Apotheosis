  <p>
</p>

  <p>The divine land possessed a long history.</p>

  <p>The time span of a single divine era was unimaginably long. Since the establishment of the divine land, numberless divine eras had flowed into history.</p>

  <p>In every divine era, there were countless living beings that became True Gods. And after becoming a True God, their inner worlds would form a perfect closed loop. Their lifespan was unlimited, which normally meant eternal existence for all of these beings.</p>

  <p>True Gods continued to be born, but only a few had died.</p>

  <p>As each of the countless divine eras passed, the number of True Gods in the divine land began to form an extremely large group.</p>

  <p>However, the number of True Gods that were able to become Holy Beings was extremely small.</p>

  <p>Mike Luo was the only one with the surname "Luo".</p>

  <p>When these True Gods heard her speak, they instantly understood what the blue-robed woman meant.</p>

  <p>They had heard that Holy Mike and Holy Bromley were friendly with each other, so even though there was quite a commotion in the Hall of Holy Beings in the divine land, Holy Bromley still remained firmly on Mike's side, resisting the pressure placed upon him. This Luo Luo Zheng must be the son of Mike. Then it was no surprise that he had been able to take Bromley as his master.</p>

  <p>Master Evil and Wayne had sensed Luo Zheng's talent and had considered taking him in as a disciple. They abandoned the idea while they heard that Luo Luo Zheng was Bromley's disciple. Now that they knew he was the son of Mike, they understood that they were overthinking things.</p>

  <p>"Well, I really did not see that coming," Master Evil grimaced.</p>

  <p>Wayne standing beside him nodded his head in agreement.</p>

  <p>At most, he would simply run away after killing three of Murphy's disciples. The divine land was vast and boundless, so although Murphy was a Holy Being and had access to the highest authorities, it would still be difficult for him to learn the truth about what had really happened.</p>

  <p>However, the war between two universes had begun within the inner world of a Holy Being. Murphy was not the only one who was watching this war with interest; the Hall of Holy Beings were also monitoring the situation closely.</p>

  <p>At the start the two of them had been very active, but now they had begun to retreat.</p>

  <p>"I will go," Blayd spoke calmly.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Blayd is eminently suitable. He has a highly esteemed status. And he is not afraid that Murphy will take revenge on him. Then, thank you for being so willing to take on this task," The face of Master Evil was beaming while he spoke.</p>

  <p>Blayd rolled his eyes. He had a very different background compared to these two. The two of them were both known as infamous villains in the divine land. If they were exposed, they would be haunted by many people. Even if Murphy did not act against them, other Holy Beings might be inclined to kill them.</p>

  <p>However, Bromley held Blayd here for different reasons, so he was not afraid of Murphy.</p>

  <p>"Then I will also go." The blue-robed woman smiled slightly. Compared to the two of them, she didn't display any reluctance. Her alluring eyes revealed a faint black fog that escaped along her eyelashes as if it had left a black eye shadow on her eyelids.</p>

  <p>"Alright," Luo Luo Zheng said as he nodded his agreement.</p>

  <p>He was unconcerned who accompanied him as long as he was able to solve this problem without delay.</p>

  <p>At this, Master Evil and Wayne remained behind in the Immortal Mansion, while Blayd and the blue-robed woman followed Luo Luo Zheng out of the Immortal Mansion, heading for the battlefield in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>A demonic red dragon breath soared into the sky.</p>

  <p>The dragon breath was like a dam burst, turning half of the sky a deep crimson red.</p>

  <p>A figure traveled back and forth in the dragon breath. With a leap, he arrived above the head of the Ancestral Dragon and stepped down lightly onto its head.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>An unseen force pressed down, and the giant head of the Ancestral Dragon was forced downwards hard.</p>

  <p>"This young fellow is truly amazing, but unfortunately it's still too young," Pranav spoke quietly. He had been trapped within the bamboo forests by Supreme Lord of Original Sin, but he had not expected to encounter the Ancestral Dragon after expending a great deal of effort to unravel the maze array.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>That head was heavily trampled into the ground of a supreme world, and had sunk down deeply. It directly drilled through that supreme world.</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>Pranav had just stepped on the Ancestral Dragon and the nine different colored Genuine Dragons next to him began to shine. They also spewed out different kinds of dragon breath including acid fog, flames, and lightning and so on.</p>

  <p>"You? You are far more useless than that!"</p>

  <p>Pranav's lips curled up and his body rapidly spun in the air. A soft light was emitted from his body as he unexpectedly withstood the full force of the dragon breath. When he charged towards the Five-clawed Golden Dragon, he extended his hand and clutched at the air.</p>

  <p>A giant, light-yellow hand grabbed a tender spot of the Five-clawed Golden Dragon. He then began to exert force.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon was instantly crushed into two pieces.</p>

  <p id="top_12">However, in the instant his body was broken, the broken section of the Five-clawed Golden Dragon began glowing with a bright light. It appeared like flowing heavenly essence. It ran like mercury, and the two broken parts reconnected to restore the dragon.</p>

  <p>The nine bodies of the nine Genuine Dragons were heavenly bodies.</p>

  <p>Although the heavenly bodies weren't as strong as the original bodies, they were still extremely difficult to destroy. These heavenly bodies had been damaged on dozens of occasions, yet they repaired themselves again and again.</p>

  <p>However, if these bodies continued to collapse and the heavenly essence weakened beyond a certain point, it would be difficult to reconstruct the bodies. Now that they couldn't do anything to Pranav, they were naturally in a bad situation.</p>

  <p>On the other side...</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle and Xun moved back and forth. They appeared almost like two comets in the sky as they circled around Marko.</p>

  <p>"Wow, I never thought that a human girl could possess such a temperament. I, Marko, am deeply honored to have two such beautiful companions."</p>

  <p>Marko narrowed his eyes as he held up the Soul Searching Flag. His eyes were locked firmly onto the two girls.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>With the assistance of Supreme Lord Healum, the bone wings on Xun's back flapped and she suddenly appeared next to Marko. Her eyes took on a red appearance as her whole body was shrouded in dark red fog. The Faith Energy she had accumulated from the Pool of Faith for numberless years was now swarming into the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>This strike held a terrifying determination to kill. Under the condensing of the spear intent, it seemed as if it could pierce straight through everything.</p>

  <p>"The Faith Energy of killing? I like it!" Marko smiled. He didn't attempt to dodge. Instead, he pressed his hand on Xun's Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Supreme Lord of Oracle appeared behind Marko. She looked like a shadow as she traveled through space. The dim light in her hand silently swept relentlessly towards the back of Marko's neck.</p>

  <p>A trace of excitement could be seen on the beautiful face of Supreme Lord of Oracle. At this distance, she had never failed.</p>

  <p>However, right at this moment, a strong sense of danger struck Supreme Lord of Oracle's heart. A gray trajectory suddenly appeared. It struck Supreme Lord of Oracle's mind, leaving her with no time to evade it. She felt only a wave of dizziness before she lost consciousness, falling down from the sky.</p>

  <p>The Flash Bat's speed was unimaginably fast. Previously, it had killed Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment in a single hit, but it had only knocked out Supreme Lord of Oracle. Naturally, it was Marko who showed mercy to her.</p>

  <p>At this time, Marko had already grabbed Xun's Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>With a tug, the Saint Killing Spear flew out of Xun's hands like an arrow into the vast space. Seeing this, Xun wanted to spread her wings and escape, but this was also the time that Supreme Lord Healum wanted to pull back Xun.</p>

  <p>Marko's eyes flashed and he casually patted as he sealed Xun's space. He extended his hand over Xun's shoulder and grabbed her suddenly. In an instant he crushed the bone wings on Xun's back and shook the Soul Searching Flag again.</p>

  <p>A gray belt of light appeared from inside the flag and swiftly encompassed Xun.</p>

  <p>The moment Xun became entangled by the light, she felt her soul unable to move. Even her speed of thought greatly slowed down, and she was unable to control her body to make an escape.</p>

  <p>"Such a beauty, it would be a shame if she died." Marko chuckled before falling backwards. With the Soul Searching Flag in his hand, he shot downwards.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle was falling while unconscious, and she was caught up by Marko after a little while. As Marko shook the Soul Searching Flag, a gray light belt once again appeared from the flag and wrapped around Supreme Lord of Oracle, holding her tightly.</p>

  <p>Marko hung the two girls from the Soul Searching Flag just as if they were spoils of war.</p>

  <p>As for Xun and Supreme Lord of Oracle who was now waking, by this point, their mood had already sunk to rock bottom. It was better to die fighting in the universe than be captured by a person who acted in such a way.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" Marko's face had a dirty expression as he reached out his hand and gently pinched the face of Supreme Lord of Oracle. Supreme Lord of Oracle could not move, but she continued to stare into Marko. Her cold eyes were filled with burning desire to kill.</p>

  <p>"I like the expression in your eyes," Marko patted the face of Supreme Lord of Oracle. Then, he glanced to the side to see Xun. Although the two women both wore cold expressions, their auras were as different as the sky and the earth.</p>

  <p>He was about to play around but just then he suddenly heard the whistling of the wind behind him. His heart froze and he pulled the Soul Searching Flag as he rushed to the side.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A sword light sent from several hundred miles away slashed Marko from the side. The sharpness of this sword light actually chilled Marko's heart.</p>

  <p>If it had not been for his sharp reactions, this strike might actually have killed him.</p>

  <p>A few hundred miles away, Luo Luo Zheng held his Great Weighty Sword as he stared at Xun and Supreme Lord of Oracle, who were hanging on the Soul Searching Flag. The veins on his temples were exposed while his face was filled with a malicious Mu Ning.</p>
