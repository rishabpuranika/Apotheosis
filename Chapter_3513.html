  <p>
</p>

  <p>The use of the metal token was to control the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng pulled it out, the Sanskrit words orbiting it emitted a red light.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately came to the conclusion that the red light indicated Elvinia's existence as the purified being. When the token sensed the presence of a purified being stepping into the energy vortex, its mechanisms would be triggered to activate. The following reaction would be so vicious that it would cause the purified being to instantly perish inside the energy vortex.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had managed to extend the energy vortex to a considerable degree, there was still a chance of him facing an assault if he left the iron house to enter the channel.</p>

  <p>Because of that, it was in his best interest to pick it up and take it with him.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the lower floor of the iron house, Zheng prepared to move past the darkness to leave the house. Before he could make his way out, he heard a familiar voice call out to him from behind.</p>

  <p>"Wait, stop!" Elvinia demanded as she stopped in her tracks.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng asked, looking back, seemingly confused by her sudden change of mind.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were barren of all emotions, as they screamed of murderous intents. "The Element Spirit Civilization is too powerful. We can't afford to offend them. They won't let us go that easily, as we've taken too many things."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, her fingers glowed visibly as a light began to gather at her fingertips.</p>

  <p>The monsters behind the iron bars of the cages became aware of her intentions for them. They shrunk themselves to a corner as they trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit pleaded pitifully, "Please, I beg of you... Spare us!</p>

  <p>I've told you everything I know, just don't kill us..."</p>

  <p>However, Elvinia stood with an unfaltering resolve. She showed no signs of going back on her decision.</p>

  <p>Just as the blazing white light slowly became more violent amidst the darkness, Zheng quickly acted up and grabbed ahold of her arm. "Stop it, Elvinia. Let them go."</p>

  <p>Elvinia glanced at Zheng with questioning eyes reflecting complicated emotions. She turned away and said in a low voice, "Don't blame me for being cold-blooded. You know the consequences of letting them go."</p>

  <p>She was aware of Zheng's tendency to feel sympathetic towards others and treat them with leniency. However, she didn't expect him to stop her in this situation.</p>

  <p>"No, you have my word. My lips are sealed. I won't utter a word to anyone!" The Shape-shifting Spirit begged as it screamed with its voice filled with sincerity to gain Zheng's favor. It even went as far as to morph into a human girl and got on its knees to plead with both hands clasped near its chest.</p>

  <p>At this sight, Zheng couldn't help but let out a loud sigh. Even if the spirit kept its word and didn't expose them, its master would still have various means of obtaining information from its memory.</p>

  <p>He turned his gaze towards the monsters and asked, "You have been confined for so long. Have you ever thought of escaping?"</p>

  <p>"Escape?" the Shape-shifting Spirit switched its gaze between Zheng and the cage and spoke with low spirits. "We can't leave the darkness."</p>

  <p>More than half of the iron house remained cloaked in darkness, which was similar to the environment of the Dark Region. The Shape-shifting Spirit and the monsters trapped in cages were living creatures of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Their adaptive nature towards the dark and their poor resistance against the light were obvious.</p>

  <p>"Then how did you get trapped in here?" Zheng asked, seemingly confused.</p>

  <p>"We were brought here in a box. There must be a black box," replied the Shape-shifting Spirit.</p>

  <p>As soon as he heard it talk about a 'black box, ' a recollection of encountering that object transmitted in Zheng's mind. The furrows on his brows relaxed as the past confusion now cleared up. "I see..."</p>

  <p>After he finished his words, he turned around and climbed back up on the upper floor and took down a black box stationed at the corner of the wall.</p>

  <p>He had overlooked the black box before. The Body-strengthening Jades had directed his complete attention towards them, causing him to disregard it.</p>

  <p>Curious as he was, he began to explore to uncover what was so special about this object. The bottom of this black box seemed to have nothing out of the ordinary. However, as Zheng reached to discover what was inside it, he found an independent Dark Region lying dormant underneath the box.</p>

  <p>"Is this what you were talking about?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes! This is it!"</p>

  <p>Realizing its days of being trapped were about to end, the Shape-shifting Spirit couldn't help but give in to its emotions and felt thrilled. During its rush of excitement, it forgot it had morphed itself into a naked human woman and even made provocative postures. Zheng's eyes widened before he looked away instantly and scowled in an annoyed tone, "Transform back immediately!"</p>

  <p>After the Shape-shifting Spirit switched back to its original shape, Zheng broke the iron cages as though they were insignificant planks of wood.</p>

  <p>The initial appearances of those monsters were intimidating, but they weren't violent in the slightest way. It also helped ease the tension amongst them after they communicated with the Shape-shifting Spirit. One by one, the monsters walked out of their respective iron cages without uttering a word before getting into the black box in Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>After storing the black box securely into Elvinia's Sumeru Space, the pair advanced to the small door in front of them.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the first to walk out of the door. Soon after, a cracking sound echoed in the distance as the dazzling thunder wings appeared on his back and fluttered gracefully before spreading wide. Shortly after, Elvinia walked out of the door and rushed into his embrace, holding onto him tightly.</p>

  <p>The original channel of the energy vortex had expanded seven to eight times. As a result, it was far more spacious. The restless energy bands were rendered useless as they had no effect at all. Elvinia could fly leisurely between them without a hitch by using the Cloud Flying Wheel if she wanted.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't intend on it. She'd rather remain in Zheng's arms and let him escort her to their destination. Silently, she curled up in his embrace and held onto him tightly.</p>

  <p>Flying on the broad and quiet channel was as easy and simple as walking on the ground for Zheng. He maneuvered himself with ease, and within less than half a minute, Zheng had rushed out of the energy channel and fell on the stone platform. As he flew, he left behind a series of electric light that fluttered in the air before it disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Princess Elvinia!"</p>

  <p>"Princess Elvinia has finally returned!"</p>

  <p>"What a relief..."</p>

  <p>Seeing Elvinia descend with the safe embrace of Zheng, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace who awaited their return quickly surrounded them.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Elvinia and Zheng so close to each other, Chaim instinctively glanced at Dorothy, who stood beside him. She watched them with empty eyes as she clenched her fists and bit her lip. Unlike the others, she stood rooted to the ground.</p>

  <p>Curious as they were, the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief also huddled around Elvinia and began throwing numerous questions her way, pestering her.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to explain, Elvinia brushed past them after saying a few cold words.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples could do nothing but bear with Elvinia's cold treatment of them. They had heard of many tales regarding Tianxing and his strength, and now they finally had the opportunity to see him up close.</p>

  <p>They were looking forward to meeting with Tianxing and Elvinia the most.</p>

  <p>The Lust World and the Desire World were worlds apart. The battles that took place in the Desire World were far more violent. However, this time, the Oneness Sky Palace weren't just going to encounter the super forces but also the powerful forces belonging to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter whether it was Tianxing or Elvinia, it was clear both of them would prove to be a great help to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>After all the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace gathered, they were led out of the stone platform by the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, and they headed towards the depths of Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Although they were both situated on the Other Shore, the Lust World and the Desire World were notably different from one another.</p>

  <p>Stage Thirteen in the Lust World was capable of applying pressure on the Souls of Light, but that pressure was resistible. However, the purple light curtain hanging in the sky of the Desire World put even more intense pressure onto them.</p>

  <p>Some of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were unable to resist it.</p>

  <p>Hence, they were forced to constantly consume soul pills after walking a certain distance to support themselves.</p>

  <p>After a short period of being led by the senior disciples, they passed through a mountain. Their gaze fell upon a huge city placed in front of them, with massive aura emanating from it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had encountered cities before in the Lust World. He had visited the large city of the Abyss Spirit race.</p>

  <p>However, the number of creatures in the Lust World could not be compared with that of the Desire World. Even their strength was on a league of its own. The city of the Abyss Spirit race was simply not on par with the one in front.</p>

  <p>"Are there living creatures of the Other Shore in that city?" A new disciple asked while giving his shoulders a nervous rub.</p>

  <p>"Of course, this is the Myriad Spirits City. It obviously has creatures of the Other Shore inside it, and their numbers are immense. But don't worry. As there are many powerful races in this stage, creatures have to follow the rules. As long as they don't act recklessly, we'll be safe," a senior disciple replied to calm the nerves of the anxious disciple.</p>

  <p>Even the senior disciples were nervous when they stepped into Stage Fourteen for the first time.</p>
