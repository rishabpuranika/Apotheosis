</p>

  <p>It took five minutes for Reinhard, who was very familiar with this place, to adapt to the environment.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the others took much longer.</p>

  <p>Some of the grassroots True Gods had indeed cultivated a few Truths of Divine Dao before coming here.</p>

  <p>However, the Truths of Divine Dao spreading around the divine land were not complete. They only consisted of a few dozen words or so. What was worse, some of them were wrongly translated. So, these warriors who had cultivated the Truths of Divine Dao before didn't have much of an advantage here.</p>

  <p>Aside from them, there were warriors who had poor perception. For those warriors, it was impossible to adapt to this constantly changing Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>One by one, they sat down cross-legged as they tried to adapt to or even fight against this unfamiliar environment.</p>

  <p>However, there was no way to wipe out the aura of the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it would be impossible for the Non-combat Zone to forbid a Holy Being from attacking others.</p>

  <p>"Aargh!"</p>

  <p>A top-rank True God suddenly vomited and staggered out of the thin line.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Another top-rank True God fell to the ground, his eyes rolling to the back of his head as he fainted.</p>

  <p>At first, it was the True Gods of the first-tier clans who decided to quit.</p>

  <p>Later, even some disciples from the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands chose to quit too.</p>

  <p>In order to enter the debate venue, one must have a certain degree of comprehension of any Truth of Divine Dao, or else they would find it difficult to move even a step.</p>

  <p>The True Gods who dared to enter the debate venue in the end were more or less prepared.</p>

  <p>About an hour later, nearly seventy percent of the True Gods adapted to the venue's aura, including Enoch.</p>

  <p>As for the remaining thirty percent, they could do nothing but wait outside the thin line.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have adapted to the Truth of Divine Dao here, follow me,"</p>

  <p>Reinhard said indifferently, but he couldn't stop his gaze from falling on Luo Zheng from time to time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's performance was a small blow to him.</p>

  <p>Reinhard had gotten used to the aura in the debate venue within five minutes? a record time for him.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the disciples of the Sword Clan had an advantage in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Since the Sunrest Tree Region was their home, they had had a lot of practice in adapting to the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had dug a big hole in the Sunrest Tree, and the disciples of the Sword Clan practiced by quickly entering and exiting the hole. One moment, they would be in the Non-combat Zone, and the next, they would return to the Killing Zone. As they moved in and out repeatedly, they could imitate the environment in the debate venue where the aura constantly fluctuated between the Truth of Goodwill and the Truth of Malice.</p>

  <p>As the most hardworking disciple in the Sword Clan, Reinhard had set a record of ten minutes to adapt to the aura in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>This time, he had made even greater progress. He had adapted to the aura in just half the time it had previously taken him; obviously, this was something that he could be very proud of. He had thought that he was the first person to get used to the aura in the debate venue and that no one could even come close to being as fast as him.</p>

  <p>But when he opened his eyes, he saw Luo Zheng and Yan talking and laughing as if no one was around.</p>

  <p>Yan was different; she had been recommended by Harold, after all. All the members of the Sword Clan attached great importance to her.</p>

  <p>Her brother, however, was merely a low-rank True God. He had never shown any skill or talent before. How could he get used to the aura so fast?</p>

  <p>Thinking about it frustrated Reinhard.</p>

  <p>These siblings were too powerful to imagine!</p>

  <p>Reinhard helplessly led the way as he wondered what Luo Zheng's powerful performance could mean for all of them.</p>

  <p>"Duke, when do you plan to do it? It will get more and more troublesome as we go deeper," Wesley said using his life vitality as they were walking forward.</p>

  <p>Duke frowned and shook his head. "Just wait. It's not the right time."</p>

  <p>"Actually, we have the advantage in numbers, so it's not too early to attack now," Wesley said.</p>

  <p>There were only 11 members in the Sword Clan; even if they counted the brother and sister of the Luo Clan, there were only 13 people they would have to face.</p>

  <p>Relying on Duke's influence, the top-rank True Gods of the wealthy clans would swarm up; they had a great chance of winning.</p>

  <p>"No!" Duke shook his head and rejected Wesley's suggestion. "I will arrange it myself."</p>

  <p>Seeing how stubborn and determined Duke was, Wesley sighed and gave up trying to convince him.</p>

  <p>Guided by Reinhard, the crowd moved thirty miles, and the mist in front of them became thicker and thicker.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A huge shadow flashed through the mist.</p>

  <p>"There is a monster!" someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I saw it too. It seems to have a pair of wings."</p>

  <p>"No, what I saw is a monster with a long pair of horns."</p>

  <p>However, what Luo Zheng saw was a human figure.</p>

  <p>When he heard the words of the other True Gods, his eyes flashed with a trace of confusion. 'It is definitely a human figure, there's no mistake. But it seems that everyone is seeing something different. What's going on?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods became nervous. The shadow hiding in the deep mist brought them great fear.</p>

  <p>It was said that even Holy Beings would die here in the debate venue if they were careless. Compared to them, these top-rank True Gods were as insignificant as ants, and they would be trampled to death if they were not careful.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic." Seeing the nervous expressions on their faces, Reinhard smiled indifferently. "The things you see in the mist are formed by your malicious thoughts. They are also the things you fear the most in the depths of your hearts."</p>

  <p>"Are they illusory things?" Luo Zheng could not help but ask. He had a vague feeling that there was something wrong with the figure he saw.</p>

  <p>"No, they are not. The strong Truth of Malice in the debate venue will bring what you fear the most into being. So at this stage, we have to deal with our own malice. Only by defeating our own malice and destroying our fear can we pass through this stage," Reinhard explained.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, many people turned pale.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>"Bring what we fear the most into being?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think we can pass through this stage."</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods looked terrified.</p>

  <p>Everyone had a fear, and they also considered it the evilest existence.</p>

  <p>If a boy was bitten by a dog, he would be most afraid of dogs.</p>

  <p>Then, if he came to the debate venue, he would see a dog in the mist.</p>

  <p>However, the top-rank True Gods present here had all participated in countless battles, and were elite warriors in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that the things that these top-rank True Gods feared the most were all rare and terrifying. Hearing Reinhard's words, Wesley and Gino gulped in fear.</p>

  <p>They were obviously afraid of whatever they were seeing in the mist.</p>

  <p>However, to their surprise, Duke had a smile on his face. "Duke, what are you looking at?" Wesley asked.</p>

  <p>Duke took a long look at Wesley and then said, "For the past few years, I wasn't living in our clan. Do you know where I was?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Weren't you cultivating in seclusion?" Curiosity was written all over Wesley's face.</p>

  <p>Until a few years ago, Duke had often fought in the Arena of Legends and had once even ranked first among the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, he had disappeared without a trace, and his points had been cleared up. Even the disciples of the Dongfang Clan didn't know where he had gone, but they had all assumed that he had gone to cultivate in seclusion. After all, it was common for warriors to do that.</p>

  <p>It was only after the opening of the debate venue that Duke had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. None of the disciples of Dongfang clan had been expecting it.</p>

  <p>"No." Duke shook his head. "All these years, I was in the Abyss Demon Region."</p>
