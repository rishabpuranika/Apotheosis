<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2727 The Abyss Demon Region </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen Gregorio's Memory Flame before and knew that there was great hatred between Gregorio and Nicholas.</p>

  <p>After being reincarnated, Gregorio could have begun a new life, but in order to take revenge, he had given up everything without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>A person like that was probably more terrifying than Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't leave Nicholas's Memory Flame until he finished viewing everything, right down to the last drop of his memories. A strange look appeared on Zheng's face then.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Nicholas hadn't wanted to leave Lorena while going to the Abyss Demon Region with the alliance of the powerful clans, so he had taken her along as well.</p>

  <p>'If my mother is in the Abyss Demon Region, what should I do?'</p>

  <p>After viewing the Memory Flames of two Holy Beings, Zheng felt a little tired. He shook his head slightly, trying to forget the trivial memories.</p>

  <p>After descending the stairs, Zheng walked up to Leland and the others.</p>

  <p>These people should not have entered the Reincarnation Land along with him.</p>

  <p>They had almost paid the price of their lives. They should definitely gain something.</p>

  <p>Using the Memory Flame to cultivate was a good method. As long as they didn't destroy their own Memory Flame and were careful enough not to shatter their soul, their cultivation base would be further improved.</p>

  <p>Now, it was time to wake them up.</p>

  <p>Billowing smoke rose up, blotting out the sky and covering the sun.</p>

  <p>However, the Abyss Demon Region was not dark.</p>

  <p>Crimson magma was flowing between the numerous cracks in the ground, shrouding the whole area in heat and reddish light.</p>

  <p>In addition to the light and heat, the magma gave off a pungent smell of sulfur.</p>

  <p>Of course, anyone who stayed in the Abyss Demon Region for a long time would get used to this strange and unwelcoming environment, even the smell.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>A black fish leaped out of the magma.</p>

  <p>Fish like this, without flesh or blood, could only be found in the Abyss Demon Region. The only thing covering the fish's bones was a thin layer of black skin.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the special property of its skin, it could survive in the horrible high temperature of magma.</p>

  <p>Just as the black fish fell back down into the magma, a thin line flew over and hooked onto the fish.</p>

  <p>With a slight tug of the line, the fish was lifted up.</p>

  <p>"The body of this fish is very special. Its skin can be used to make a fire-resisting shield," a consummate True God from the Fang Clan said as he reached out for the black fish at the end of the line.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as his fingers touched the fish, he screamed and threw it up in the air. The fish was burning hot, just like magma! Thinking quickly, he pointed his space ring at the fish and stowed it away.</p>

  <p>Over ten years ago, the rich clans on the Floating Islands had barely known anything about the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>At that time, they had been free to go on adventures in the other three forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>After these forbidden areas were closed, however, the alliance of the rich clans had been forced to go to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Right now, whether they wanted to or not, they knew more about the Abyss Demon Region than before.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>Just then, the magma underneath began to bubble up again.</p>

  <p>"Stan, it seems that another black fish is going to come out," one of them said.</p>

  <p>Stan Fang simply smiled. Then, with a gentle pinch of his finger, he once again threw out the thin thread.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The thread shot out straight toward the magma.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>At the same time, something jumped out of the magma.</p>

  <p>Unlike what Stan had thought, it was not the fish, but a black hand!</p>

  <p>The thread fell straight into the grasp of the huge hand, which closed its fingers around the thread and pulled it down hard.</p>

  <p>It all happened so quickly that Stan was pulled forward before he could react.</p>

  <p>"Stan!" the consummate True God next to him yelled in concern.</p>

  <p>Reacting quickly, he raised his hand, sending a beam of blade light straight down toward the thread that the giant hand was pulling Stan with.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The blade light cut the thread into two pieces.</p>

  <p>But by then, Stan Fang had fallen into the huge hand's grasp and was being dragged down into the magma.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Stan is being dragged down!" the consummate True God shouted.</p>

  <p>A split second later, a flash of light appeared in the distance, where the Holy Beings and the Demi-holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans were resting.</p>

  <p>As soon as he heard the consummate True God shouting for help, the Demi-holy Being of the Fang Clan turned around and flew away.</p>

  <p>He glanced around and, noticing the fluctuation on the surface of the magma, furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>Then, he jumped down from midair and slapped his hand on the ground!</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>With a ringing sound, a wave of cold air rushed out of his body and spread out at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>The crimson magma froze in an instant. It turned pitch black before quickly being covered with a layer of white frost!</p>

  <p>Leaping over to the layer of frozen magma, the Demi-holy Being punched down.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>As the magma began to crack, the Demi-holy Being grabbed two frozen pieces from the ground:</p>

  <p>Stan Fang and the huge hand that had dragged him down.</p>

  <p>Then, the Demi-holy Being lifted Stan's tough body and threw it on the ground; immediately, the ice around him cracked.</p>

  <p>Next, he stepped on the huge hand, which was fragile with cold, instantly turning it to powder.</p>

  <p>He had no interest whatsoever in killing the owner of the hand under the magma. It would just be a waste of his energy.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the chilly air in Stan Fang's body, he started to scold him, "Your cultivation base is very high, but how could you be so careless? You have brought disgrace on our Fang Clan!"</p>

  <p>The hand which had pulled Stan Fang into the magma belonged to a Lava Giant. If Stan had been just a little more careful, the Lava Giant wouldn't have posed any threat to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry..." Stan Fang knew that he had indeed been too careless.</p>

  <p>Without responding, the Demi-holy Being of the Fang Clan took a step forward before turning into a flash of light and returning to his resting spot.</p>

  <p>At that spot, Nicholas and the other Holy Beings were currently looking at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Sitting with his legs crossed, Tianming said lightly, "In the secret land on the second stage, there is an exit which leads to the third stage. I'm sure this is a shortcut. Taking this path will save us at least a month!"</p>

  <p>When the Holy Beings heard this, their faces lit up.</p>

  <p>Sure, a month was not a long period of time for them.</p>

  <p>However, in the Abyss Demon Region, an accident could occur in the span of mere seconds, so the less time they spent here, the better.</p>

  <p>Naturally, everyone was willing to take this shortcut.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you report it to your clan before?" Troy questioned.</p>

  <p>Tianming glanced at him indifferently and replied, "I've never tested this path, and I've already reported the secret land in the second stage. Have you ever been there?"</p>

  <p>In the last year, Tianming had discovered and explored the secret land in the second stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>In fact, on the side of the secret land was a path to the third stage.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming had not stayed long after stepping into the third stage.</p>

  <p>It was too dangerous for him to wander around the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region alone.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not a big deal," said Nicholas drily. "Just follow the path Lowell described!"</p>
