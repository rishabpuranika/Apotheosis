<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng thought that there wasn't anything special about Luther except for the fact that he was smart.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luther had fully mastered the cultivation method for life vitality that Luo Zheng had taught him. In fact, he could be ranked as a talent if he was in the divine land.</p>

  <p>All in all, Luo Zheng didn't expect that Luther could have such a power.</p>

  <p>Luther crossed his hands together and slowly separated them. Then, he put his index fingers and thumbs together.</p>

  <p>A flash of unique energy burst out between his four fingers, which turned into a faint brown light curtain.</p>

  <p>He looked through the light curtain with a faint smile on his face and said, "Of course you are bound by the Curse Chain as well."</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up as he moved forward and looked through Luther's hands.</p>

  <p>Upon first glance, everything remained the same through the light curtain.</p>

  <p>Just then, he noticed that there was something behind him. He looked at it more closely and soon enough, recognized it. His eyes lit up in surprise. "Is it the Curse Chain?"</p>

  <p>The Curse Chain was composed of golden button-sized bugs.</p>

  <p>The bugs' heads and tails each had a hook on them, which were connected to each other and formed a chain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't the only one who owned the chain. Luther and Zelda also had it.</p>

  <p>"How could this be?"</p>

  <p>He had only been in the world he was now in for a short time, so he didn't know when the chain had bound him up.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luther went to the door of the thatched hut. He aimed his hands at the distance and told Luo Zheng, "Take a look again."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked into the distance through the light curtain again as instructed.</p>

  <p>There, he saw millions of intertwined chains that swayed in the air and were scattered all the way to the distance.</p>

  <p>"Every living being in this world has a chain like this, and you are no exception," Luther said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Even the most powerful Wild Gods in this world can't get rid of these chains. They can only hide in the bone towers when the Light of Adjudication comes," Zelda added.</p>

  <p>A bitter frown made its way to Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He wanted to return to the divine land as soon as possible. He didn't expect that the Curse Chain at the bottom of the chaos had bound him.</p>

  <p>"Has anyone tried to destroy the Curse Chain?" he asked. "Yes," Zelda replied.</p>

  <p>"For example, I did," Luther muttered with a small smile.</p>

  <p>His face suddenly looked mature, which did not really match his age.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng was naturally shocked. "But Zelda just said that even the most powerful Wild Gods can't do anything about it."</p>

  <p>"Obviously they can't do anything. It's still impossible for them to break free from the Curse Chain no matter how strong they are," Luther said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"But our race made these Curse Chains." "Your race?" Luo Zheng asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded and explained, "In this world, we're more powerful than all the other races. Only a very few people know our existence, and they call us the Warden race."</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the chaos was an extremely vast world. No one knew how exactly big it was.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God, however, had turned its entirety into a huge prison.</p>

  <p>All those people the Chaos Ancient God had cursed were exiled there, and they could never leave the place forever.</p>

  <p>In fact, ending up in such a prison was considered death penalty.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful the living creatures were, they wouldn't be able to resist the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>Both the powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm and the Wild Gods that were born and raised there would perish under the purification of the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>Such a thing had happened countless times ever since. It was the final resting place for numerous powerful living creatures that had died.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Warden race was excluded.</p>

  <p>They were different from the other races since they were born to manage the prison.</p>

  <p>They had performed their duties well for a long time and they had never missed even one living creature.</p>

  <p>One thousand years marked a cycle of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>The cycle began when those living creatures the Chaos Ancient God had exiled came to the chaos and lived for a thousand years before they died.</p>

  <p>Then, another cycle began.</p>

  <p>"It's said that an accident happened eighty billion years ago," said Zelda.</p>

  <p>The Warden race had existed for a very long time, but Luther and Zelda were still young. Thus, their knowledge of those things came from what they had heard.</p>

  <p>"What accident?" Luo Zheng asked. "A Chaos Ancient God had died."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had heard his mother mention the Chaos Ancient God before, but he couldn't actually imagine what it was.</p>

  <p>She, however, had also said that even the people in the Source World looked up to the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Therefore, how could such a being die?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, eighty billion years was too long and legends changed as they were passed down.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that it was true.</p>

  <p>"It's true." Luther broke into a grin and exclaimed, "His dead body is lying over there!"</p>

  <p>He then pointed towards the horizon.</p>

  <p>The space in the distance was littered with many huge bone towers.</p>

  <p>Despite the remoteness, Luo Zheng saw those huge things clearly.</p>

  <p>After all, the height of a bone tower was comparable to that of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"You mean those bone towers are the bones of that Chaos Ancient God?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked in surprise. "Yes. There's nothing that can resist the Light of Adjudication because it is created by a Chaos Ancient God, but the skeleton of that Chaos Ancient God is not afraid of it," Zelda explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't believe what he just heard.</p>

  <p>The prison's physical conditions did not change at all even when the huge dead body just came down.</p>

  <p>After a few cycles of reincarnation however, some living creatures had discovered its use.</p>

  <p>Those exiles were very clever. They hid in the dead body to avoid the purification of the Light of Adjudication for numerous cycles of reincarnation, and then eventually developed.</p>

  <p>As more and more exiles came, the prison gradually became prosperous.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, the exiles were all united and did not have any conflicts--after all, survival in the prison was more important than anything else.</p>

  <p>All was well until the dead Chaos Ancient God's skeleton had begun to decompose with the passage of time, and the life energy contained within the skeleton had also flowed away. Only his bones that towered into the clouds were left behind, which were now the bone towers.</p>

  <p>After that, the exiles constantly moved from place to place like nomads, but in the end, they could only hide inside the bone towers.</p>

  <p>As time passed by, the living creatures in the chaos increased in number.</p>

  <p>In addition, the strong warriors became incomparably powerful because they took advantage of the wild bones. They began to fight for the bone towers because only the bone towers could protect their lives.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the wars broke out among the clans as well because they wanted to occupy the bone towers and seize the wild bones.</p>

  <p>The long fight lasted until today.</p>
