<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he noticed the scene on the wall, Luo Zheng fell speechless.</p>

  <p>In other words, he no longer had the need to find an opponent at random.</p>

  <p>All he needed to do was accept any True God's challenge. He could have his pick among the one hundred and ninety-five warriors.</p>

  <p>"How fucking weak do I really look if everyone wants to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng touched his nose shyly and forced a smile.</p>

  <p>On the contrary though, the one hundred and ninety-five people who had challenged him didn't actually think Luo Zheng was weak at all.</p>

  <p>The Hall of True Gods had a very reasonable system, in fact. Through constantly adjusting the warriors' rankings, the system could accurately show a True God's genuine strength.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng's situation was completely different. From the very first day he entered the Jade Wall of Legends, never had he been defeated. No one knew his true ranking, and there was no record of this anonymous man in the Jade Wall of Legends. He was currently ranked 96th, according to his room's position.</p>

  <p>"Since I can simply choose my own opponent, I better choose the weakest one."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out his hand and his finger grazed the names on the wall.</p>

  <p>These names were all inscribed neatly in front of him. Finally, his finger came to a stop on someone's name, someone who ranked 196th. This warrior was named Yilia Fang.</p>

  <p>The strength gap between any two warriors among the top two hundred wasn't very large.</p>

  <p>In order to benefit from the most possible consecutive wins, Luo Zheng would naturally choose the weakest opponent. What he wasn't really aware of though, was that his opponent wouldn't really be weak.</p>

  <p>In the Hall of True Gods</p>

  <p>The competition that would decide the Floating Islands' rankings had reached its peak intensity.</p>

  <p>A few of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands had estimated that their points would be beneficial to them, and they thus convinced many of their disciples to avoid accepting challenges so as to prevent being defeated and losing their points.</p>

  <p>Other wealthy clans thought that their rankings would ultimately be lowered, so they naturally forced their disciples to fight in the Hall of True Gods in order to gain more points.</p>

  <p>The Fang Clan's Floating Island ranked sixth in the Time Sea, but it had great ambition. The top three powerful clans, the Dongfang Clan, the Sword Clan, and the Moon Clan, had unshakable positions, and the Fang Clan was unable to deal with them. Yet, with an immense effort from the Fang Clan, they had respectable chances of defeating the Leng Clan. For this reason, the Fang Clan's True Gods were currently very active in the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>Today, Yilia Fang was also looking for her opponents in the Hall of True Gods. She had already won four consecutive wins herself, rising from the 247th ranking to the 196th. Following such a success, she immediately launched a challenge to the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>The anonymous man carried such an incredible number of points. If the anonymous man accepted her challenge and she won against him, she would equally gain a huge amount of points. Furthermore, her contribution would be nearly the same as that of the Fang Clan's consummate True Gods. Everyone's greatest desire was to gain this honor, as well as the highest clan reward.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, losing against this man wouldn't affect her at all, aside from perhaps dozens of points.</p>

  <p>That said though, she also knew that the chances of this anonymous man choosing her were rather slim.</p>

  <p>To her absolute surprise, after she had sent him the challenge just that morning, the anonymous man accepted her challenge no more than four hours later.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the light on the wall, she felt slightly stunned, and then a look of surprise and joy washed over her face.</p>

  <p>Although it felt much longer, only a few seconds passed.</p>

  <p>She entered the Arena of Legends with confidence.</p>

  <p>As the environment around him changed, Luo Zheng too, quietly entered the Arena of Legends. As he entered, his view was filled with a world covered in mist and rain, surrounded by countless pavilions and towers, everything completely drenched by the showers. As he breathed in gently, the unique fragrance of the rain immediately took over his senses.</p>

  <p>"This world isn't half bad after all," Luo Zheng said after taking a quick look around.</p>

  <p>He knew that they could change the environment in the Arena of Legends, and a few wealthy clan members would choose environments that suited them. In Zheng's opinion, besides the pleasant atmosphere, there was no other use to this world full of mist and rain.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Yilia Fang appeared opposite to Luo Zheng. When she saw the anonymous man standing before her, she grinned. "Wow! I'm so lucky.</p>

  <p>Why did you accept my challenge?"</p>

  <p>While this woman had a gentle appearance, she wore a pitiful look on her face. To her question, Luo Zheng replied faintly, "Because you rank the lowest among the warriors who challenged me."</p>

  <p>Yilia Fang smiled anew and immediately shook her head. "Then I'm afraid you've picked the wrong opponent."</p>

  <p>"And what exactly do you mean by that?" Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Yilia Fang stretched out her hand slightly, and a clear raindrop fell onto it. The drop shook slightly, as if it had the power of life. It began attracting the raindrops around her, and suddenly, the single drop turned into a short transparent water-colored sword.</p>

  <p>She gently waved her four fingers and thumb, and the sword floated upward, aiming itself directly at Luo Zheng. It began to spin on itself continuously. As he watched the sword, the woman said, "The anonymous man is best at pure strength. His soul is also very strong. In addition, he has understood the complete Ice Soul Flame, which is an inheritance from Holy Jay. This is all I know about you. With this alone, you are no match for me."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows and his expression displayed nothing but surprise. The only person knew that he used the Ice Soul Flame was the fat man— Moore Moon. "Did Moore Moon tell you that, by any chance?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Now, it was Yilia Fang's turn to look and feel surprised. Her beautiful eyes opened wide. "You don't know? How pathetic! That fat man hid this news very well at first, but before long, he was using it to earn himself money."</p>

  <p>Moore Moon was a mighty warrior ranked 20th, yet he had lost to Luo Zheng, otherwise known as the anonymous man. The anonymous man had accumulated a large number of points, and naturally attracted people's attention. The seniors of wealthy clans were equally willing to obtain more information about the anonymous man. At first, Moore Moon didn't want to reveal such, but he eventually gave in to the temptation of divine might coins.</p>

  <p>In the hands of every one of the top two hundred low-rank True Gods was a piece of information about Luo Zheng. What was more, they had even analyzed Zheng's strength and weaknesses.</p>

  <p>"Wow! He really knows how to make money," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head from side to side.</p>

  <p>"If what Moore Moon was saying is true, then I'll be very honored and more than pleased to end your winning streak!" Yilia Fang said, gently waving her hand upward this time. Thousands of raindrops began to gather as one. Countless water-colored short swords appeared within a one thousand feet radius, with Luo Zheng as the center.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Those swords flew like a torrential rain toward Luo Zheng, all at once and coming from all directions.</p>

  <p>'Even if the water in the divine land is much heavier than that in the universe, do you really think it can hurt me?' Luo Zheng thought in his mind, as a strange expression contorted his features.</p>

  <p>Dense swords rushed toward him in epically straight lines, and there was nearly no way or time to dodge them. Luo Zheng didn't even attempt to move in the least, but let the swords hit him instead.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't afraid, not at all. He knew that these water swords were barely harmful and rather powerless. They couldn't even cause him any harm.</p>

  <p>However, the tender smile on Yilia Fang's face remained, seemingly as calm as ever.</p>

  <p>"What?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>Before long, Luo Zheng too, noticed something was completely off.</p>

  <p>When these swords hit his body, they immediately turned into rain water.</p>

  <p>However, the rain didn't flow down onto the ground. Instead, it was actually glued to his body.</p>

  <p>Realizing how strange this was, Luo Zheng shook his body lightly in an attempt to get the water off him. However, the rain stuck to his body like paste, and no matter how hard he shook, he failed to make it come off.</p>

  <p>"This water is very strange," Luo Zheng murmured, frowning slightly. He had a feeling that something bad was about to happen, and took action without a second's more delay.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng faced Moore Moon, Luo Zheng had almost lost to him. These talents from wealthy clans all had very special tricks up their sleeves. Upon remembering this, Luo Zheng suddenly flashed and rushed toward Yilia Fang.</p>

  <p>"You didn't notice anything wrong until now? It's too late!"</p>

  <p>Yilia Fang stood on tiptoe, and her body quickly slid backward. On a street full of rain, she continued retreating, bringing up bursts of water flowers with every step.</p>

  <p>The water splashed out as it equally turned into a short sword, shooting toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't go too far. More and more rain clung to his body, weighing him down. He couldn't get rid of the thick layer of water. It was even blocking Zheng's speed now. How could he catch up with Yilia Fang with so much water slowing him down?</p>

  <p>"Burn it out!" Luo Zheng frowned and a flame emitted itself from his body. The blazing, orange flame was immediately extinguished the second it shot out.</p>

  <p>"The Parting Water can conquer all kinds of fire, not to mention that your flame hasn't even fully developed yet." Yilia Fang shook her head. "I may as well tell you that you can't break out from the Parting Water's grasp with your strength alone. I'm curious to discover what else you have to resist me with."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, the rain water that was hitting Zheng's body formed a water ball of at least ten feet in height, tightly wrapping itself around him.</p>

  <p>The Parting Water was a thousand times heavier than ordinary rain water.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng simply couldn't exert his strength beneath such dead weight. He had no choice but to accept the fact that he was indeed trapped.</p>
