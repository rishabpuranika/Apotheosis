  <p>
</p>

  <p>King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others remained on the alert.</p>

  <p>They thought even the weaker Treacherous Beings couldn't be taken lightly.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons, however, were used to them.</p>

  <p>Even Campbell, an awakened Treacherous Being, couldn't resist the temptation of the Arcana. How much more these unintelligent, friendly ones?</p>

  <p>More and more Treacherous Beings of grotesque shapes gathered around the group, almost completely blocking their way.</p>

  <p>"Drive them away," Bacchus ordered.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons swung their blades and cut through the Treacherous Beings easily. The weaker ones were sliced into pieces. The friendly-type ones dodged and scampered in various directions.</p>

  <p>Although they couldn't die, the creatures still instinctively evaded danger.</p>

  <p>After clearing the way, the group continued onward.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Mountain was already massive from the outside, almost as large as half of the Night View Island. Its inner space was even more spacious.</p>

  <p>Up ahead, a row of square prison cells came into view. Beside the cells were stone tablets engraved with figures of different creatures.</p>

  <p>"What are those creatures?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"They are also Treacherous Beings," Bacchus explained. "But unlike those outside, the Treacherous Beings here can be fused. You can enter the cells after imprinting the glazed sheets on the stone tablets."</p>

  <p>Decker at the end of the line piped up, "The thorny Treacherous Beings our Wooden Leaf race have fused with are over there."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a cell not far away. There was a pattern of Treacherous Being with poisonous spines on the stone tablet beside the cell.</p>

  <p>"Only the weakest hostility-level Treacherous Beings are kept here," a Glede Demon pointed out disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Of course the Wooden Leaf race would choose such low-level Treacherous Beings. The Glede Demons scoffed at such weaklings.</p>

  <p>The gap in strength between the Treacherous Beings they preferred were quite large. Some top hostility-level Treacherous Beings were as strong as the resentment-level ones.</p>

  <p>Among these were the Wolf Owls that the Glede Demons fused with. They were the strongest among the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>"Now we go to the far right," Bacchus pointed out.</p>

  <p>Everyone followed behind Bacchus and entered the rightmost passageway.</p>

  <p>After they entered, another row of square prison cells came into view.</p>

  <p>Hostility-level Treacherous Beings were kept in these cells as well.</p>

  <p>"Now we go to the passageway at the far left," said Bacchus.</p>

  <p>The layout of the Ghost Mountain was obviously carefully designed.</p>

  <p>Treacherous Beings were kept in rows upon rows of cells, and the passageway leading to the depths of the Ghost Mountain zigzagged from left to right.</p>

  <p>Knowing the Element Spirit Civilization led by the Eye Spirit was very likely to chase after them, the group sped along the zigzag passageway.</p>

  <p>"There are about a hundred prison cells in each row, where about a hundred kinds of hostility-level Treacherous Beings are kept. We have passed seven rows along the way, so seven hundred kinds of Treacherous Beings, too."</p>

  <p>Surprise was written all over Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face.</p>

  <p>He never imagined there were so many kinds of Treacherous Beings in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Bacchus smiled. "There are a total of six hundred rows. At the three hundredth row, there are two bypasses, which lead to the left and right regions of the Ghost Mountain."</p>

  <p>"So there are tens of thousands of different kinds of Treacherous Beings in the Ghost Mountain?" Fuxi asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"We've calculated that there are one hundred and ten thousand kinds of hostility-level Treacherous Beings on this floor alone," answered Bacchus.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned at the number.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan turned its head and glanced at Decker. There were so many kinds of Treacherous Beings, yet the Wooden Leaf race only chose those on the first row. How pathetic!</p>

  <p>Noticing the gaze of King Ieuan, Decker could only smile helplessly. Given the lack of strength of the Wooden Leaf race, they could only choose the weakest Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many?" the Snake Goddess asked, genuinely puzzled.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the chaos could not become Treacherous Beings, after all.</p>

  <p>All the Treacherous Beings came from outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>So how could there be so many of them in the Ghost Mountain?</p>

  <p>"Someone must have captured about one hundred thousand kinds of creatures in the Abstruse Energy World and placed them here," Fuxi deduced.</p>

  <p>"And they were all killed and transformed into Treacherous Beings..." Luo Zheng trailed off. He also didn't know the reason.</p>

  <p>Why, indeed?</p>

  <p>To facilitate the fusion of creatures on the Night View Island with Treacherous Beings?</p>

  <p>It didn't make any sense.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the creatures captured from the Abstruse Energy World weren't originally meant to become Treacherous Beings," the Snake Goddess mused aloud.</p>

  <p>"So what happened?"</p>

  <p>Bacchus asked.</p>

  <p>Even those from the Night View Island didn't know much about the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Over the years, they had just taken it for granted, not thinking deeply about how it came into being.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps there was an extinction-triggering calamity in the Abstruse Energy World, and some people hid in the chaos to avoid it. At the same time, they brought the creatures from the Abstruse Energy World and built this mountain to hold them. Perhaps an accident caused all the creatures to die, so the Ghost Mountain became what it is today," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>"It's possible," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, nodding.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng agreed. "That theory is probably close to the truth," he said.</p>

  <p>It was very likely that there were no original intentions to turn creatures into Treacherous Beings. After all, they were all living creatures before they were brought here.</p>

  <p>It took the group more than six hours to reach the last row at the bottom of the Ghost Mountain. Although they moved fast, the zigzag passageway impeded their speed, somewhat.</p>

  <p>There were also one hundred prison cells in this last row. Luo Zheng finally spotted the tortoises the Red Demon race had fused with and the Wolf Owls the Glede Demon race had fused with.</p>

  <p>At the end of the row of cells, there was a stairway paved with black stones.</p>

  <p>The steps were several thousand feet high, leading up to the second floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>When they reached the second floor, more prison cells came into view.</p>

  <p>However, these cells were larger.</p>

  <p>The prison bars were quite thick, and through them, they could see the huge resentment-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>There was a giant elephant in the nearest cell.</p>

  <p>Its attention was drawn by the arrival of Luo Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>Its long trunk stretched out from the space between the bars and slowly swept toward them. It looked friendly and kind.</p>

  <p>Friendly-type Treacherous Beings were not known to be aggressive, so Fuxi reached out his hand to touch the elephant's trunk.</p>

  <p>But just as he did, the elephant suddenly emitted a disgusting aura!</p>

  <p>The auras released by friendly-type Treacherous Beings were not strong, and could even be negligible. But the killing-type and attaching-type Treacherous Beings emanated extremely disgusting auras.</p>

  <p>Fuxi reacted quickly. As soon as he felt the aura, he immediately jumped tens of feet back. Luo Zheng and the others likewise quickly distanced themselves from the cell where the giant elephant was imprisoned.</p>

  <p>The elephant continued to try to reach Fuxi with its trunk.</p>

  <p>But it was a moment too late. It failed to grab him.</p>

  <p>HOWL!</p>

  <p>The enraged elephant roared in its cell.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say the Treacherous Beings in the Ghost Mountain were all friendly-type?" Pearson asked gravely.</p>
