<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 312 The Counter Attack (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>While James pondered over killing Luo Zheng or not, Luo Zheng acted first against him.</p>

  <p>"The flying knife? I don't fear it at all. It means nothing to me," James blurted out arrogantly.</p>

  <p>Just as he said it, he saw the broken flying knife heading towards him.</p>

  <p>Like a reflex, he lifted his long blue sword up and chopped up the weapon.</p>

  <p>Although James' blue sword was made from his life vitality, it was as mighty as a fairy weapon as it had absorbed loads of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>In addition, James used his Ruin Sword when he chopped up the broken flying knife.</p>

  <p>The chopping manifested James' unique and skilled swordsmanship as his long blue sword landed on the very center of the knife.</p>

  <p>It was what he thought at first--that he could chop Zheng's knife into two halves with his powerful sword.</p>

  <p>But when his own weapon touched Zheng's knife, it was immediately shattered broken.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? My sword was produced from my life vitality and it's even comparable to a fairy weapon. How could a broken flying knife destroy my sword?" mumbled James in shock.</p>

  <p>Never could he have expected that Zheng's broken flying knife would be so strong. As he watched his life vitality-based long sword get chopped into two by a knife, he was stunned agape.</p>

  <p>The long sword was as hard as a low-grade fairy weapon. How was it possible that his sword was cleaved by a defective knife? The idea was still totally unbelievable for James even as it happened right in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>Still, the broken flying knife worked fast. As soon as the long sword was destroyed, it went straight for James' head.</p>

  <p>In any other situation, it would be a piece of cake for James to escape such an attack, but James was still shocked by what had just happened to his weapon. While he was standing in a daze, lost in his defeated thoughts, Zheng's knife dashed right for James' head.</p>

  <p>As James snapped out of the daze, the knife was already extremely close to his face.</p>

  <p>Faced with the cold weapon, he felt an intensely cold chill run up his spine. It was not until that moment that he realized that he would have been killed by a guy who had only reached the first grade of nature level if he hadn't come to his senses timely.</p>

  <p>At the critical moment, James jerked his head away from the broken flying knife almost completely on instinct. His head was stiffly inclined sideways, only inches away from the attack he dodged.</p>

  <p>Thwip!</p>

  <p>The knife flew right by James' face, slashing his cheek and leaving a small wound on his face. A drop of blood trickled down as James' eyes widened.</p>

  <p>Although he had fought several battles before, he couldn't help but feel rather chilled to his bone at that moment.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had defeated James' son with his strength on the first tier of the nature level. In spite of Zheng's amazing strengths and boundless prospects, James took for granted that Luo Zheng was less powerful than him.</p>

  <p>In James' eyes, Luo Zheng was still like an ant, only a little stronger than others at his level. Considering what he achieved in the Illuminating Soul Realm, James thought that he could deal with Luo Zheng easily in any way he wished. Although Luo Zheng was capable of escaping his weapon and could stand his ground, James never thought that it meant Luo Zheng would be a threat to him and arrogantly scorned that Luo Zheng couldn't possibly inflict any harm upon him.</p>

  <p>Contrary to his expectations, Luo Zheng could even put him to death, not only bring him harm.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't instinctively dodged away from Zheng's knife, James would have already been a corpse lying on the ground, the sharp weapon having pierced right through him.</p>

  <p>Normally, people were scared when in danger of death. After narrowly escaping death, however, their fear would turn into an extreme fury.</p>

  <p>Such was the case for James at that moment.</p>

  <p>Originally, he wanted to ponder further upon what Wurth had said to him, so he could weigh the pros and cons of killing Luo Zheng, and hesitated because he had the option to only inflict mild punishment on the man.</p>

  <p>Now, though, James was filled with rage. As a consequence, he thought of nothing but putting Luo Zheng to death.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nory, Wurth, Sean, and Nina were shocked frozen by the scene.</p>

  <p>When James intended to execute Luo Zheng, Wurth threatened him, making him begin to change his mind about dealing with Luo Zheng. Alas, the incident was beyond all expectations.</p>

  <p>Someone like Luo Zheng was able to counterattack James, someone who had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Huh, Luo Zheng was so strong. No wonder that many people spoke highly of his might…"</p>

  <p>Given what just happened, Sean remarked with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Wurth heaved a heavy sigh and complained, "Ah, Luo Zheng nearly killed James and now he's in even greater trouble. It looks like we can't do anything but wait for the clan elders to deal with the current situation. It would be dangerous if James counterattacks Luo Zheng. Would Luo Zheng be able to endure the attack until the elders come?"</p>

  <p>Standing straight and still where she was, Nina kept biting her lips. At this moment, she activated her Immediate Messager again, wondering why the Zhu family hadn't arrived yet. Something in the air made her feel anxious.</p>

  <p>Even Yetta, who stood beside her, turned ghastly pale as well.</p>

  <p>As a female member of the family, she didn't have any right to speak. On one hand, she hoped that her uncle would remain safe and unharmed against Luo Zheng, but on the other hand, it was clear to her how huge the trouble her uncle would cause to the Mo family if he continued to act willfully and arbitrarily. Perhaps Yetta's uncle still wanted to bet on a chance. In his opinion, Nina was only a female member of the Zhu family, so he concluded that her family wouldn't really lay hands on the Mo family only because of her.</p>

  <p>However, as Nina's best friend, Yetta knew her well. There was no doubt that Nina would absolutely not let James go if Luo Zheng was truly killed.</p>

  <p>Given that, she wondered what she should do.</p>

  <p>"You son of a bitch. You looked for trouble deliberately, so you can't put the blame on anyone else," James retorted as his face turned grim. In the meantime, Ruin Sword suddenly beamed with a much brighter, brilliant blue light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Lifting his fake fairy weapon, James pointed his Ruin Sword at Luo Zheng, swaying it up and down for four consecutive times.</p>
