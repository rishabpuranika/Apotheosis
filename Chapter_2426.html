  <p>The three elders no longer doubted Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Mikail wandered all over the divine land and did many good deeds. He unexpectedly died in a supreme treasure of belief," Bill lamented.</p>

  <p>All three of them looked extremely aggrieved.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had a good reputation due to their benevolence.</p>

  <p>It was rare for the members of their clan to get into conflict with others.</p>

  <p>They were upstanding and helped whenever they could, especially if someone was being bullied.</p>

  <p>Back when Mikail was stabbed by the Spear of Time and was at the edge of death, he still reminded Luo Zheng to be careful with his residual consciousness.</p>

  <p>This did not benefit Mikail but helped Luo Zheng avoid the danger.</p>

  <p>He was truly benevolent.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for bringing back Mikail's bones," Clifford told Luo Zheng with sincerity.</p>

  <p>"I should really be thanking Master Mikail," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>After Ivan carefully collected the skeleton, Luo Zheng said, "I'd like to ask for your help."</p>

  <p>Bill looked at Luo Zheng. "What can we do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Harold Yu, a consummate True God of my clan, is also participating in the debate over Divine Dao. I don't know where he is right now, but if you manage to hear any news about him, can you tell me?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Bill, Clifford, and Ivan looked at each other and smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's no big deal. No matter which city he appears in, we will inform you immediately," Bill affirmed with a nod.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, an emerald bird flew over them. It circled the beams and landed on his hand.</p>

  <p>Clasped between the bird's feet was a jade slip that Bill took and crushed.</p>

  <p>The moment the jade slip was pulverized, a wisp of consciousness immediately poured into his mind.</p>

  <p>He was taken aback for a moment before laughing out loud. "What a coincidence! It's a letter from the Sword Casting Divine City."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat. "Harold has already passed the first round of screening with a girl. That girl managed to obtain seventeen swords in the first round," Bill announced.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exclaimed, his eyes flashing with a brilliant light.</p>

  <p>According to Hallet, Harold must participate in the debate.</p>

  <p>However, this wasn't an assured thing.</p>

  <p>This piece of news excited him!</p>

  <p>"Given Harold's speed, he should've already arrived. Let me take you there."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was quick to accept the offer. Together with the three consummate True Gods, Luo Zheng left the hall and headed straight to the edge of the main stem.</p>

  <p>They soon arrived at the entrance of the Killing Zone.</p>

  <p>Upon arrival, Luo Zheng saw the top-rank True Gods entering the Killing Zone one after the other.</p>

  <p>On one side of the entrance was a burly figure wearing a white robe.</p>

  <p>The sight of this burly man could only make Luo Zheng sigh.</p>

  <p>His lifelong ideal had been to climb to the pinnacle of the martial arts.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Life and Death Realm already seemed so high.</p>

  <p>Then, when he met this man, he knew better. In fact, this burly man completely changed Luo Zheng's perspective in less than three seconds.</p>

  <p>With just a small portion of his power, he would already be able to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Such a powerful and incredible individual had shocked Luo Zheng at that time. He had the motivation to advance forward because this man took Yan with him.</p>

  <p>Until he became a True God, Luo Zheng could stand in front of this man.</p>

  <p>Harold felt the auras of the three consummate True Gods of the Sword Clan. He turned to look and his gaze immediately fell upon Luo Zheng. There was no trace of shock on his face, only a warm smile as if he had already anticipated this.</p>

  <p>"Harold! Welcome! Our Sunrest Tree Region is greatly honored by your gracious presence!"</p>

  <p>Bill, Clifford, and Ivan greeted with clasped hands as they bowed to Harold.</p>

  <p>Harold also bowed, acknowledging their politeness.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan had no dispute with the Sword Clan, and they even used to be on good terms.</p>

  <p>However, when the Luo Clan fought with the Mu Clan, the Sword Clan remained silent. Nobody knew why but it was probably due to various reasons.</p>

  <p>After the initial greetings, the three from the Sword Clan figured that Harold might need to talk to Luo Zheng privately, so they left of their own accord.</p>

  <p>Once they left, Harold turned to Luo Zheng with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know why but at that moment, he didn't know what to say and just remained silent.</p>

  <p>It was like a pause, a short moment of silence. Finally, Luo Zheng broke it with a question. "Where is my sister?"</p>

  <p>Harold retained his faint smile. "She's in the second round of screening."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. "Will she be in danger?"</p>

  <p>Harold shook his head. "Yan's talent is at the same level as yours. She's already become a top-rank True God and is one step away from becoming a consummate True God. Do you really think she'll be in any danger?" Harold asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Old memories flashed through Luo Zheng's mind. "You're right," he said after a while but he truly just didn't know what else to say.</p>

  <p>"You must have a lot of questions," Harold remarked.</p>

  <p>He was correct. Luo Zheng did have a lot of questions.</p>

  <p>It was precisely because of this reason that Luo Zheng found himself unable to ask even a single one.</p>

  <p>The young man was deep in thought and it was only after a while did he look up at the entrance of the Killing Zone. "Why do you want Yan to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of agreement Luo Xiao and Harold had, Luo Zheng felt subconsciously responsible for it. He would've preferred it if they left Yan out of it and let him take the risk instead.</p>

  <p>"I know I shouldn't have let Yan get involved but you did not go to the Everest Spirit Mountain. This was the only alternative plan I could think of," Harold said.</p>

  <p>"What is the purpose of this debate? Don't tell me that it's to discuss the highest level of the Divine Dao," Luo Zheng asked once again.</p>

  <p>On the surface, this debate held by the Sword Clan was to study the limits of the Divine Dao, decipher Sanskrit words, argue about the meanings of the Divine Dao, and discuss the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>These were what attracted countless True Gods in participating.</p>

  <p>However, these things were impossible to solve. Not even Holy Beings would be able to do so.</p>

  <p>So what exactly was the true purpose for this event?</p>

  <p>Harold was quiet for a moment but there was a decisive look in his eyes when he opened his mouth again to speak. "You're right. There is another purpose. The true goal of the Sword Clan is to obtain that skeleton," Harold replied frankly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed. "You mean that skeleton of the powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm?"</p>

  <p>"It seems Hallet already told you about this," Harold remarked appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"It might also be Joy," Luo Zheng said but he couldn't deny the excitement in his eyes. At least what he knew was beyond Harold's expectations.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Harold merely shook his head. "Women aren't interested in these things at all."</p>

  <p>With that, he reached out and cast a faint light curtain over him and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were just some things that weren't for other people's ears, even the Sword Clan's.</p>

  <p>"What is the identity of that skeleton?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Harold pointed to the sky. "The captain of the ship," he said, his finger also dropping and pointing to the ground. "The captain of the entire divine land."</p>
