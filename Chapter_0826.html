<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Teresa's goal was to reach the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin in one and a half months.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Tower of Sin, the quickest time for one to advance to the tenth floor was one month. This individual needed to be so strong that no one dared to challenge him from the first day that he entered the tower.</p>

  <p>In the past, a few creatures had advanced to the tenth floor in one month, but they were all war lords.</p>

  <p>Some talents from different races stayed in seclusion in their respective sacred places to cultivate until they became war lords. Once they reached this cultivation level, they would enter the Tower of Sin to gain experience.</p>

  <p>War fighters stayed on the first five floors, while war generals fought on the sixth to the tenth floors.</p>

  <p>No other creatures would dare to challenge these war lords except if they met their peers on the way to the top of the tower. With no opponents for a month, they could reach the tenth floor as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>However, a war general like Teresa had a slim chance of reaching the tenth floor in a month. This was because her peers were likely to fight their ways to higher floors. And it didn't matter whether they could defeat Teresa or not, they would all make her have to waste a few days.</p>

  <p>Teresa had no problem encountering other war generals because she had to respect the rules. She had even spared 15 days just to deal with these idiots.</p>

  <p>She always had it easy because the war generals she had encountered so far were weaklings.</p>

  <p>However, the guy in front of her was different. He was a war fighter of the eighth level. And what was more fascinating for Teresa was that he was a human!</p>

  <p>Since when did cowardly humans have the courage to challenge the noble Demon Night?</p>

  <p>Teresa's beautiful eyes exuded strong killing intent. The killing intent and her perfect face would cause one's heart to palpitate with fear. The metaphor of these two different feelings would create a huge gap and would cause everyone to feel a special feeling.</p>

  <p>"You're truly worthy of being a near-perfect race. Every woman of the Demonic Night is a stunning beauty," Luo Luo Zheng said, slowly drawing his sword.</p>

  <p>"Is that a sacred weapon?" Teresa cocked her slender eyebrows that were like willow leaves. "When did the Purple Heart Sacred Place become so generous that they gave a sacred weapon to a war fighter?"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Luo Luo Zheng brandished his sword and said with a faint smile, "I'm not from the Purple Heart Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>Teresa laughed coldly and said, "Well, it doesn't matter who you are! All I know is that you're no match for me!"</p>

  <p>She lightly tiptoed, and like a mother leopard, she suddenly rushed out. The forceful energy within her body released a faint light, setting off her graceful silhouette on the arena.</p>

  <p>"You're very agile." Luo Luo Zheng smiled, his long sword slightly twisted. He was still using the basic swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng continued to improve his basic swordsmanship, the sword moves were also slowly evolving.</p>

  <p>The basic swordsmanship was created with endless efforts by the predecessors, and then further simplified by Luo Luo Zheng to the extreme. As a result, it had reached its simplest form, but Luo Luo Zheng had no intention to stop improving.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had the intention of making the simple basic swordsmanship complex.</p>

  <p>There were two ways to evolve basic swordsmanship. The one that Luo Luo Zheng had accomplished was evolving from complexity to simplicity. The other one that Luo Luo Zheng had intended to do was to evolve it from its simplest form to its most complex.</p>

  <p>A true grandmaster was able to create his unique martial arts. The unique martial arts, no matter what level they were, were not something that just popped out from the stone. Instead, they were something created by living beings. Even Transcendent Divine Might was the same.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew very well that if he followed this path, he would eventually be able to create his unique technique!</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's reaction was fast. Facing the close-ranged assassination of Teresa, he used the circle parry to completely ward off her attack.</p>

  <p>Despite the power that Teresa was showing, Luo Luo Zheng did not retreat. Instead, he stuck his sword on Teresa's dagger, and launched an attack.</p>

  <p>Teresa was somewhat confused.</p>

  <p>She was quite fast. And this human war fighter was nothing compared to her. Even if a human war general used his sacred weapon to resist her attack, his entire body would still be blown away by the impact. However, Luo Luo Zheng was like a mountain standing steadily in front of her, using only that simple and crude swordsmanship to block her attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Teresa's strength was a bit stronger than that of Brent of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Her physical and explosive strength, as well as the innate advantage endowed by her race, was much greater than Brent's. However, Teresa seemed to have less comprehension of laws because she was a body refiner.</p>

  <p>"Tornado Thrust!"</p>

  <p>She had originally planned to blow Luo Luo Zheng away and then cut off his flesh piece by piece. The more miserable he was, the more she would be able to intimidate those idiots in the Tower of Sin. This way, no one would dare to challenge her again and she would be able to reach the top of the tower in no time.</p>

  <p>Compared with Luo Zheng's simple swordsmanship, Teresa's dagger suddenly became like a violent storm thrusting countless times in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Circle parry." Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly as his long sword moved slightly horizontally and completely sealed himself.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>A series of clear and melodious sounds rang out, as the dagger and sword clashed countless times in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>A thin three-foot-long sword like an airtight shield appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>Teresa's explosive strength was limited. Her forceful energy and physical strength couldn't last as long as the life vitality. After a short burst, Luo Zheng's long sword once again clashed against her dagger. As Luo Luo Zheng gently pressed his sword, the two got much closer.</p>

  <p>They could even almost touch each other's nose.</p>

  <p>Teresa's chest heaved up and down. Her Tornado Thrust would normally be able to instantly deal a fatal blow to her opponent. Once she used this move, the opponent would instantly die. When Teresa used her Tornado Thrust on a war general at the eighth level, the general was torn to pieces by her dagger and there wasn't a single piece of skin left on his body.</p>

  <p>But to her surprise, unlike the war general, this human war fighter in front of her had used a long sword to block all her attacks!</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?" Teresa's eyes revealed a terrified expression. She was so shocked that she was even a little flustered.</p>

  <p>The people of the Demon Night were very slender. And with Teresa wearing her boots, she was even taller than Luo Luo Zheng. Using the Tornado Thrust, Teresa had used a lot of her strength. She was breathing fiercely. Her sweet breath directly brushed against Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was still looking at her with a poker face.</p>

  <p>"It is indeed quite vicious." Luo Luo Zheng laughed faintly.</p>

  <p>"How dare you laugh at me!"</p>

  <p>Teresa clenched her teeth. The dagger in her hand suddenly exerted force.</p>

  <p>The dagger's short blade was pulled apart along the edge of Luo Zheng's long sword. As the two weapons pulled apart, a violent spark was generated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A sharp and ear-piercing sound rang out, and then like a snake, she wrapped herself around Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>In close combat, short weapons had a greater advantage than long weapons.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Teresa did not intend to pull apart the distance between her and Luo Luo Zheng. She tried as much as she could to shorten the distance between them.</p>

  <p>This way, she could get the advantage in this fight.</p>

  <p>However, just as Teresa was about to wrap her slender arm around Luo Zheng's neck, Luo Luo Zheng unexpectedly lowered his head.</p>

  <p>If she succeeded, then she could have stabbed her dagger into Luo Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was stronger than her, he wouldn't be so arrogant once her dagger slashed his neck.</p>

  <p>However, Teresa didn't succeed. Luo Luo Zheng lowered his head to dodge, and then turned around and brandished his long sword, the blade of the sword slashing horizontally at Teresa's buttocks.</p>

  <p>As this event unfolded, Phoebe became anxious and even screamed. She covered her mouth not to distract Luo Luo Zheng from his fight.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the spectator stands, someone suddenly stood up. He was a war lord from the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>As a divine-level talent of the Demon Night's sacred place, it was impossible for Teresa to enter the Tower of Sin on her own. Therefore, she had elders of her race to protect her all the way.</p>

  <p>According to the war lord's assessment, Teresa wouldn't have any trouble completing the first nine floors of the tower with her current strength and power.</p>

  <p>But as for the human brat challenging Teresa, the war lord had a bad feeling about him. It was already strange that he had a girl from the Demon Night following him given that he was just an ordinary war fighter. Even a tenth-level war general was no match for Teresa. Any cultivator superior to Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't even dare to challenge Teresa, so naturally, the war lord wasn't worried at all. Humans were naturally weak!</p>

  <p>To his surprise, however, Luo Luo Zheng managed to resist Teresa's attacks. As Luo Zheng's sword slashed at Teresa's buttocks, his mind went blank. With the sharpness of the sacred weapon in Luo Zheng's hand, he could have cut Teresa in half. He couldn't afford to let Teresa die because there was no way he could explain it to the clan elders.</p>

  <p>The expressions on the other creatures' faces in the spectator stands were also vivid.</p>

  <p>The majority of them could not believe what had just happened.</p>

  <p>How could it be that there was a talent of this level among the weak humans of the Sea God Continent? They wondered whether they were mistaken, but Luo Luo Zheng was no doubt a human war fighter.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned his sword slightly, using the blade to hit Teresa's buttocks, instead of cutting them.</p>

  <p>He let go of Teresa this time.</p>
