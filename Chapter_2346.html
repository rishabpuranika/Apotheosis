<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As she watched her sister walk toward Zheng, Nelly couldn't help herself but feel suddenly uneasy.</p>

  <p>Despite the feelings that were overwhelming her, she agreed with her sister's analysis. She thought that her sister was doing the right thing in trying to eliminate the crisis in the cradle.</p>

  <p>Subconsciously, however, she still wanted to justify Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't realize that danger was looming not far from him. He was getting better and better at killing the turtles.</p>

  <p>The power of blood energy provided by killing these Golden Shell Turtles was coveted, even by a few of the consummate True Gods. It was quite an amazing tonic for Zheng, and the blood energy in his body benefited from a clear qualitative improvement!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>After chopping the four Golden Shell Turtles in half, the four huge swords grew weaker than ever before, and dispersed at once.</p>

  <p>Not even a few seconds later, the four golden turtles were already sending the four swords back at Zheng!</p>

  <p>At that very moment, a cold voice sounded behind Zheng. "I heard that you have two names? One is Tianxing Luo. And the other is...  Zheng Luo?" the voice asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows furrowed slightly as he heard these words.</p>

  <p>He didn't turn around, but continued to concentrate on controlling the four huge swords, in an attempt to kill the Golden Shell Turtles, as if he had no ears.</p>

  <p>As the others noticed the scene, all the True Gods standing under the Goddess Statue glanced at each other in confusion.</p>

  <p>As she too heard the voice, Liusu turned pale, and Aleyna's nerves felt like they were taking over her.</p>

  <p>Kelsey, on the other hand, had no idea what was being said. She whispered curiously, "Liusu, who is  Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>Among the three girls of the Han Clan, she was the only one who didn't know Zheng's true identity.</p>

  <p>Sensing something was wrong, Alfredo turned to his daughter Kelsey and scolded, "Don't ask about what doesn't concern you!"</p>

  <p>Being scolded by her father, Kelsey pouted and stopped speaking immediately.</p>

  <p>Now, Liusu felt deeply remorseful. She had inadvertently called out Zheng's name, but no one mentioned it afterwards. She thought that no one had noticed her mistake since the name "Zheng" wasn't very well known in the divine land.</p>

  <p>At that time, the consummate True Gods, including Rachelle, hadn't entered the valley just yet. Presumably, it could only have been Nelly who informed Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Of course, Liusu didn't know that Nelly had been paying close attention to Zheng this whole time, and she wasn't one to miss out on a single detail.</p>

  <p>As her deft fingers gently fiddled with it, Rachelle's short sword spun back and forth in her hand. She continued, "The name is nothing more than a symbol. It doesn't matter. The most important thing is that you're not a member of the divine land, but from the Evolutionary Universe, right?"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The four swords shattered more turtle shells once again. Zheng pulled the air inward and a Parting Water Divine Mirror appeared. Zheng had repeated this move dozens of times now. It was safe to say that he had become adept at it.</p>

  <p>He still had no response for Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Beneath the Goddess Statue stood many True Gods, and a few consummate True Gods wore odd expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is this crazy woman trying to do, again?" Walton asked, a little confused.</p>

  <p>The fan in Shahn's hand unfolded gently. He frowned and asked, "The Evolutionary Universe? Ah! I see. She suspects that this guy was the stowaway who violated the Ruling Slate earlier."</p>

  <p>Shahn was so smart that within a few seconds, he had figured the connection out. He had no idea, however, how Rachelle could have come to such a conclusion.</p>

  <p>Although she might be a little crazy, she wouldn't have just asked anyone such a question. There must have been a reason.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to answer me. No matter how you defend yourself, I'll kill you," Rachelle said with a faint smile, as she stood behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I've guessed your identity wrong. Therefore, as a compensation, I'll give you a chance to make the first move!"</p>

  <p>As she finished phrase, she raised her head slightly and confidently. Her black unbound hair pulled itself back and tied itself together, making a ponytail, and giving her an even more vivacious look.</p>

  <p>When in a fight, she liked to tie it back, which was her way of symbolizing that she was about to make her move.</p>

  <p>The True Gods present weren't blind, though. The four huge swords that moved back and forth between Zheng and the turtles were extremely powerful. Moreover, they were even a big threat to the consummate True Gods. If Zheng attacked first, she was really giving him a chance.</p>

  <p>But did a low-rank True God really have any chances of winning in the face of a consummate True God?</p>

  <p>"He's always being too cocky. He's going to die soon." Langston couldn't stop himself from laughing. To be honest, Zheng's numerous performances in the Time Sea Forbidden Land had shocked him greatly. His wish for Zheng's death was stronger than any other person, even than that of Rachelle.</p>

  <p>In the end, Rachelle was just helping the Mu Clan and even the entire alliance of rich and powerful clans, in their attempt to kill Zheng. She didn't hate Zheng herself.</p>

  <p>Liusu glared at Langston in disgust. She clenched her hands and then stared at Zheng, not knowing exactly how to help him resolve this current crisis.</p>

  <p>"All you can do is sneer at him like a coward, but you don't dare challenge him head on, do you?" Aleyna couldn't help but retort angrily at Langston.</p>

  <p>"Why the hell not?" Langston pulled a pouty face.</p>

  <p>"Just shut up! Ha-ha!" sneered Liusu.</p>

  <p>Her laughter was full of contempt, which made Langston blush. In Liusu's eyes, the gap between Langston and Zheng was much more than self-evident.</p>

  <p>It was at that very moment that a look of helplessness appeared on Soren's face. He didn't understand why Rachelle was getting Zheng into so much trouble. All he could do was wonder why Zheng, a person the Holy Emperor appreciated so much, had to be such trouble!</p>

  <p>"Uncle, that guy was chosen by the Holy Emperor. Don't let Rachelle kill him," he whispered.</p>

  <p>Not far from Soren stood a middle-aged man dressed in brocade. His name was Troy and he was a consummate True God from the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>"Was he really?" Troy asked.</p>

  <p>In fact, he understood that Rachelle wanted to kill Zheng because she suspected that he was a stowaway sent by Mike. Due to such, he had no desire to meddle in their business.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the situation would have been different if the Holy Emperor had given the order.</p>

  <p>"I received this order from the Holy Emperor," Soren replied in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

  <p>"How about we just wait and see..." Troy frowned and replied.</p>

  <p>Rachelle stood no less than a few feet behind Zheng, but her expression was careless. She watched Zheng's back quietly, and was extremely patient.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng allowed himself to kill the Golden Shell Turtles at will, he still felt disturbed!</p>

  <p>Rachelle's demand was way too sudden!</p>

  <p>Originally, he hadn't thought that exposing his identity as the anonymous man would be so problematic.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to him in the past that Rachelle had successfully guessed his true identity so easily.</p>

  <p>Judging from what she said, Rachelle still wasn't completely certain.</p>

  <p>That, though, definitely wasn't enough to stop her from killing him!</p>

  <p>What a cruel woman she was!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Once again, the four swords bounced immediately back from the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>Zheng spun around on his heel and held out his hands. In the air, two huge swords flew toward each of his hands and then flew back outward.</p>

  <p>The strength source contained within these four swords was even stronger than that of a consummate True God! The swords were raging with ultimate power.</p>

  <p>The four swords flew toward Rachelle in an abrupt gust. The powerful strength source activated strong pressure and made her ponytail fly crazily at the back of her head. Instead of showing any fear on her face, she looked excited. "I may have given you a chance, but it was also a test!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>She quickly jumped down using the tip of her toes and floated backward.</p>

  <p>Her slightly narrowed eyes revealed a cold smirk, and the short sword in her hand became blood red.</p>

  <p>If Zheng chose to attack her directly, then his identity would one hundred percent be determined, alas.</p>
