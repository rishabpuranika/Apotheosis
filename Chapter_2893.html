  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Listen," Clement said, as he signaled everyone to keep quiet. "There might be a space crack in the clouds that is disturbing the Yellow Emperor Magatama."</p>

  <p>Messages were usually sent to them through the space fluctuation from the Yellow Emperor Magatama. Through it, Clement got to know the consequences of a space crack: a violent wave would definitely disrupt the Yellow Emperor Magatama.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Godfrey, you are too paranoid!" one of the others remarked.</p>

  <p>Godfrey felt his heart sink. He didn't realize that was what people thought of him.</p>

  <p>He started to put the Yellow Emperor Magatama away when, all of a sudden, it started making noise.</p>

  <p>"Rustling, rustling... I am... And I'm at..."</p>

  <p>Godfrey held the Yellow Emperor Magatama closely.</p>

  <p>The rest of the group was staring in awe.</p>

  <p>They stooped closer to listen closely.</p>

  <p>"The divine land... Rustling, rustling..."</p>

  <p>"It seems like someone's trying to reach us through the Yellow Emperor Magatama! They might be close by." Clement's eyebrows furrowed in deep thought.</p>

  <p>"Which Yellow Emperor Guard came to this damned place?" a Yellow Emperor Guard asked.</p>

  <p>"What is this divine land, anyway? Not once have I heard of it," said Godfrey.</p>

  <p>The divine land was a name used by its residents to refer to their place, but it was a name unknown to outsiders. Thus, the warriors who weren't part of the divine land didn't understand it.</p>

  <p>"Godfrey, try to communicate with the Yellow Emperor Guard," Clement ordered. "If we continue trying to chase the Chaos Winged Beast, then perhaps we can find that Yellow Emperor Guard. But he seems to have encountered some trouble."</p>

  <p>At that point, they were nearing the bottom of the chaos where it was bleak and deserted.</p>

  <p>It was not normal for a Yellow Emperor Guard to idle around in that area, so he assumed that the Yellow Emperor Guard must have encountered a huge trouble.</p>

  <p>Because of this, they had to reconsider their options.</p>

  <p>Godfrey replied with a curt nod. He brushed the surface of the Yellow Emperor Magatama with his finger. A green light beamed above the Yellow Emperor Magatama and it started to make noises.</p>

  <p>Hamish wasn't feeling optimistic.</p>

  <p>He knew they wouldn't have much luck at finding any Yellow Emperor Guards near the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Hamish had attempted the same before the release of Leyton and others, but to no avail. After many years, he gave up.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Leyton gave the command to go on the mission, so Hamish had to pick up the Yellow Emperor Magatama again.</p>

  <p>Anyway, it wasn't difficult to activate it. It was much easier than collecting blood in the whole divine land.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Magatama continued to give off the faint green light.</p>

  <p>"I'm Hamish," Hamish declared. "I'm in the divine land seeking the help of Yellow Emperor Guards."</p>

  <p>Hamish repeated these words over and over again like a chant. He was starting to feel dumb and pointless.</p>

  <p>Hamish recalled his days in the Silverwing Divine City. Back then, he had many divine citizens by his side.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Hamish could not do anything at will after Leyton came out.</p>

  <p>He also didn't like to show off on the Floating Islands as Zavier did.</p>

  <p>"Rustling, rustling..."</p>

  <p>Hamish was starting to think his chant wasn't working, when suddenly the Yellow Emperor Magatama let out the rustling sound.</p>

  <p>The sound was so faint that Hamish almost missed it.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, it was only the space fluctuation being transmitted that was causing the Yellow Emperor Magatama to make those noises.</p>

  <p>However, that time was different. The sound was nonstop and it was growing louder by the minute.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Hamish stared at the Yellow Emperor Magatama with confusion.</p>

  <p>"Rustling, rustling... I am... I..."</p>

  <p>Hamish held the Yellow Emperor Magatama tightly and drew it closer to him. It was as if he was afraid that the sound would disappear.</p>

  <p>The voices coming from the Yellow Emperor Magatama meant there were Yellow Emperor Guards nearby.</p>

  <p>'We can finally get help!'</p>

  <p>Hamish thought excitedly.</p>

  <p>They received so much pressure from the Other Shore Realm warriors outside the divine land; finally, they were running into some luck with the reinforcements.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>With a flick of his wrist and a wave of his hand, Hamish disappeared.</p>

  <p>The next minute, he was in the Hall of Holy Beings calling out Leyton excitedly. "Leyton, I have great news about the Yellow Emperor Magatama.</p>

  <p>It finally reacted!"</p>

  <p>Leyton manipulated the Sea Cracking Skull without distractions so that it would swallow the blood.</p>

  <p>This task took a lot of control. Even he, as the owner of it, could easily be swallowed by it should he make the wrong move.</p>

  <p>Because of his utmost focus, he barely heard Hamish's announcement.</p>

  <p>After the Sea Cracking Skull finished the blood, Leyton looked up with concern. "Did it really react?" he asked. "Are there any Yellow Emperor Guards nearby?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Listen to this."</p>

  <p>Hamish handed the Yellow Emperor Magatama over to Leyton.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Yellow Emperor Magatama was quiet.</p>

  <p>Leyton glared at Hamish with a look of skepticism. "I swear I heard it just now!" Hamish insisted.</p>

  <p>Leyton smiled. "Perhaps you misheard?" he said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>He was doubtful from the beginning, anyway.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible!" Hamish refuted.</p>

  <p>Leyton opened his mouth to speak when the Yellow Emperor Magatama caught their attention. "I'm Godfrey," the voice coming from it said.</p>

  <p>"Rustling, rustling... Where are you?"</p>

  <p>In the divine land, the top three powerful clans could be seen occupying a divine tree each.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had occupied the Sunset Tree for over a hundred divine eras.</p>

  <p>That clan was originally formed by many first-tier clans that used to be separate.</p>

  <p>This all changed upon the arrival of a Holy Being. The first-tier clans had to be integrated, and the clans in the Sunrest Tree became a unified group known as the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Sword Clan owed its roots to the Sunrest Tree, and their protection to the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they had to give up the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>Samuel ordered all clans who didn't join the alliance of powerful clans to give up the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had no choice but to give up the Floating Island, completely aware of the consequences of their choice.</p>

  <p>As soon as they disaffiliated from the Floating Island, they'd make themselves an enemy of the alliance of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>Not too long ago, the Yellow Emperor Guards killed Harper in front of the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan. As a result, the Truth of Goodwill and Malice disappeared along with the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan members were sullen to have reached their last days in the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings, the Demi-holy Beings, the consummate True Gods and a lot of disciples in the Sword Clan left the Sunrest Tree and entered the Everest Spirit Mountain, leaving only a few people in the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>They didn't want to submit to Samuel, and they also believed Mike.</p>

  <p>And on the other side of the divine land, the Moon Clan in the Hidden Tree had also made the same choice. They were on the way to the Swirl Forest.</p>
