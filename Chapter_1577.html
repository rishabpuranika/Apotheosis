<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's efficiency in gathering Illusion Points was not slow!</p>

  <p>There was no need to tire himself with travelling. All he needed to do was take out the Teleportation Token to get to his next destination. This made everything extremely convenient and saved him a lot of time as well.</p>

  <p>However, he still had a long way to go when it came to bridging the gap between him and other top warriors in terms of the number of Illusion Points they had gathered.</p>

  <p>Why was this the case? Had he missed something?</p>

  <p>Did the other top warriors know something he didn't?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took out the iron ticket and a voice immediately spoke in his mind.</p>

  <p>"You can enter the Hall of Causality after paying five million Illusion Points. A total of ten warriors is required to open the hall, and six more are needed. Would you like to pay the Illusion Points?"</p>

  <p>What? Six more? That meant six more warriors were needed to open the hall.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Luo Zheng first got the ticket, only three more people were needed.</p>

  <p>Why did the number get higher?</p>

  <p>"Oh, wait, I just realized. Ten warriors have already opened the Hall of Causality. The four who are currently waiting must be another group," he said to himself.</p>

  <p>Five million Illusion Points was a lot, even for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But it seemed there were still a few who were willing to make such a risky bargain.</p>

  <p>It was terribly difficult to gather Illusion Points. Warriors didn't just stand in a queue outside the main city for him to kill. He could kill dozens but still gathered only less than a million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>There were tons of warriors around but not many of them were as strong and loaded with points as Lucille.</p>

  <p>It seemed he had no choice but to enter the Hall of Causality despite the terribly high price it asked of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng made his decision and infused a thought into the iron ticket.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to pay the Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With his consent, the Illusion Points immediately shot out from his body.</p>

  <p>Five million Illusion Points was quickly extracted from Luo Luo Zheng and transferred onto the iron ticket. Due to the sheer amount of points to be transferred, the process naturally took quite a long time.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but let his thoughts wander as he gazed at these yellow Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>What were they used for exactly? Were they simply for the sake of the rankings?</p>

  <p>It couldn't be that simple. Could it? Did the Illusion Battlefield and its point system only exist to let warriors experience life and death situations in order to strengthen their minds against pain and inevitable death?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would have to wait until the Illusion Battlefield closed to get his answer.</p>

  <p>After the iron ticket absorbed the designated total number of points, it began to emit a dazzling yellow light.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>There was a sharp, crisp sound and the light began to expand until it was tall and wide enough for a person to pass through.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not hesitate.</p>

  <p>He had to shield his eyes from the blinding light but he willingly stepped inside.</p>

  <p>Once everything dimmed, Luo Luo Zheng looked up and saw a small, square room in front of him.</p>

  <p>He swept his gaze and saw four people sitting in their respective corners.</p>

  <p>One was an ogre and the other three were human, two men and one woman.</p>

  <p>Their auras were not weak at all and he knew they couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Those who activated the iron ticket had to pass through some ancient ruins or secret areas after all. Those who were deemed worthy often had to prove themselves capable first.</p>

  <p>Moreover, five million Illusion Points was also another requirement to open this door.</p>

  <p>Luck could only take a warrior so far. Gathering that many points meant that these four were also strong competitors on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>"We've got another one. Seems like we still need five more," one of them said, glancing at Luo Luo Zheng indifferently.</p>

  <p>The ogre stared him up and down with a faint glint of provocation in his eyes. He had done this to the four other warriors that entered prior to Luo Luo Zheng but they all just ignored him.</p>

  <p>"Is this the place? There doesn't seem to be an exit," he asked and glanced over his shoulder. The skulls had been biting his back all this time but they did not follow him into the hall.</p>

  <p>"This is only a waiting room. It's only until we gather a total of ten people that we can open the Hall of Causality. You can just sit over here and wait," the white-robed, human woman told him.</p>

  <p>This hadn't been the first time she entered the hall, so she was already familiar with the process.</p>

  <p>For her, the first-timers would surely be dragging her down. She couldn't help but show her disappointment in her faces.</p>

  <p>She didn't really have a choice though. The Hall of Causality required ten warriors for it to open, so cooperation with each other was needed to advance. Fighting was also strictly prohibited in this room so it would be impossible for her to drive the others out.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, not minding the slight attitude she was giving him.</p>

  <p>However, the waiting kind of irked him. He didn't like wasting time. If he knew this was going to happen then he would've investigated the iron ticket a bit more.</p>

  <p>Sighing because he realized there was no going about this, Luo Luo Zheng simple chose his corner and sat down.</p>

  <p>The tension inside the room was palpable.</p>

  <p>The woman was at her corner, resting with her eyes closed. The two human men sat cross-legged and seemed to be regulating the life vitality within their bodies. The ogre was the only one who seemed to be glaring at everyone with open disdain. It was quite apparent that he was itching for a fight with someone.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng sat down, he held out his hand and a mini-mountain started spinning out.</p>

  <p>It was the Magnetic Sacred Mountain refined by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After defeating Lucille, he made a deal with her. He exchanged the Blood Refinement Technique for her jade slip.</p>

  <p>That jade slip contained the secret techniques of refining magnetic power, handed down secretly through her clan.</p>

  <p>Since he had time to spare, he would try to refine the magnetic power within the mountain.</p>

  <p>The ogre glared at the mountain. Refining it into a weapon seemed foolish, at least to him.</p>

  <p>The other two males also looked at the mountain and quickly sized Luo Luo Zheng up. A light quickly flashed in their eyes but they did not say anything and simply went back to their thing.</p>

  <p>They felt the power of five elements from the mountain and also something else extraordinary. They sure as hell were going to take this young man seriously now.</p>

  <p>The woman in white also stared at the mountain but her eyes were wide and she was the only one who chose to break the silence.</p>

  <p>"Hey, is that a refined Magnetic Sacred Mountain?" she asked Luo Luo Zheng with a cold, stiff voice.</p>

  <p>She was well aware of how difficult it was to refine the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. In fact, it was close to impossible. But this guy seemed to have done it! She just couldn't help but be slightly amazed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes," he answered.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Luo Zheng undid the seal on the jade slip and started to absorb the secret techniques written there.</p>

  <p>The woman, on the other hand, was already sizing Luo Luo Zheng up and beginning to figure out his background. She lamented at the fact that she couldn't really ask too many questions despite being so curious as to how he refined the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>The magnetic power was a fusion of the five elements.</p>

  <p>The power of the five laws must be balanced and had to be circulated all at the same time.</p>

  <p>The more balanced the powers were, the easier it would be to extract them, but this was difficult since the five laws were not naturally in sync with each other.</p>

  <p>This was the first information Luo Luo Zheng was able to absorb from the jade slip.</p>

  <p>He had to circulate the five different Original Laws and maintain equilibrium among them.</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, he then derived five streams of chaotic energy from his belly.</p>

  <p>The energy flowed into his fingers and through his meridians.</p>

  <p>Numerous rays of light appeared at the end of his fingers with the appearance of five different Law Powers. However, none of them was at a balanced state.</p>
