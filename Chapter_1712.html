<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1712 The Scattered Stones (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>This game of Go had all been played by the mysterious woman alone.</p>

  <p>She could definitely move all the stones on the Heaven Earth Board if she wanted.</p>

  <p>Since Tianming's power scattered some of the stones, and it was a move not made by her, she had all the reason now to reset them.</p>

  <p>But after a while, Nathan still didn't see the woman reach out her hand.</p>

  <p>He dropped his gaze and shook his head.</p>

  <p>The mysterious woman hadn't shown much skill and had made the moves quite casually. Nathan speculated that she had played the game intuitively. This natural way of calculating the future was the most accurate. Thus, it was unlikely that she would reset the stones scattered by Tianming and return them to their original positions.</p>

  <p>"What a pity," Nathan let out a sigh. Perhaps he was the most reluctant one to see this new drastic change.</p>

  <p>According to his calculation of the previous situation on the board, he would become the only dominator of the future, and nobody would be able to fight him.</p>

  <p>If things went that way, no matter how masterfully talented Luo Zheng and Tianming were, they would all become insignificant characters in the end.</p>

  <p>For that sole reason, Nathan felt not worried even if he had witnessed their outstanding talents. Though he might lose to either of them here, he knew that the odds would finally be in his favor.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming's move had significantly changed everything. And even his fate had been profoundly affected.</p>

  <p>This enigma prompted Nathan to hope that the mysterious woman would reset the stones.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, she didn't show that intention at all, or perhaps she refused even to entertain such a notion.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that he would even move the stones! That sword, built by Chiyou, is really overbearing. How did it suddenly appear in the universe after being hidden for so many years?" The mysterious woman stared at the board and muttered, "This is a disaster that will destroy the entire world. By all means, if I reset the stones forcefully, I'm afraid that this game of Go will lose its meaning, and the calculation of the future will be inaccurate."</p>

  <p>With this new situation, all the Supreme Lords also became despondent and looked pessimistic.</p>

  <p>The sudden change on the Heaven Earth Board posed threats not limited to the Godly Geniuses but also all races.</p>

  <p>It was a gloomy and hopeless situation that no one could deal with and change.</p>

  <p>"There shouldn't be such a great crisis even if it's a world of chaos. Why would things become so desperate?"</p>

  <p>"Tianming is the bane of all living beings!"</p>

  <p>"This is the fate of our universe! Trillions of lives will all be doomed!"</p>

  <p>The handwringing cries of the Supreme Lords reverberated around the universe. Everyone was overwrought.</p>

  <p>However, the despairing event on the Heaven Earth Board only lasted for half a minute.</p>

  <p>Much to everyone's surprise, a momentum also emanated from Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>It was almost exactly as powerful as that of Tianming some moments ago!</p>

  <p>As it spread out immensely, it once again scattered the stones on the board. Not a single stone left in the one-thousand-foot radius around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The situation on the board had once again drastically shifted in such a short time!</p>

  <p>"The situation on the board changed again!"</p>

  <p>"There is a way out for the white side! Ha! When God closes a door, he always opens a window!"</p>

  <p>"You are right! It's a good move!"</p>

  <p>Many white stones had displaced from their spots, which had changed the whole situation.</p>

  <p>Although the current situation on the board was still complicated, the black side was also in great danger now.</p>

  <p>All the spectators could imagine that the succeeding two or three moves would eventually decide the final result of the game.</p>

  <p>Anyway, everyone felt it was so much better now. There was still hope, after all.</p>

  <p>Nathan's expression also visibly relaxed when he noticed this new situation.</p>

  <p>This circumstance indicated that he would still play a significant role in the future. Although it was worse than the original situation, it was much better than the one caused by Tianming.</p>

  <p>'Does this mean that Luo Zheng has helped me?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>At this moment, his calculation involved not only the situation on the Heaven Earth Board but also included Luo Zheng and Tianming as well. They had directly moved the stones on the board, so they should also be regarded as one of the deciding factors, as it also showed that they could interfere with their fates.</p>

  <p>Even though Nathan unwillingly came up with such a conclusion, he had calculated that it would be more or less the case.</p>

  <p>So far, Luo Zheng and Tianming both improved and boosted their comprehension of the Beginning Swordsmanship to more than fifty percent.</p>

  <p>Tianming tightly gripped the sword named Soaring Snake in his hand as his face revealed a look of relief. He had failed to make any improvement for quite a long time. To think of a way to break through his bottleneck, he had been on pins and needles day and night.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Luo Zheng, he finally inched a step forward.</p>

  <p>"Now is the time. Let's go on, Luo Zheng!" Tianming said, beaming with a small smile.</p>

  <p>They had both managed to achieve a new upswing development, and their sword skill was currently at the same level. Now was the perfect time for them to decide the result of this fight.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly in response. Under the influence of the momentum he had just comprehended, Luo Zheng felt as if his mind had left his body, and was tossed up in the air. It was a surreal feeling as if he was in a brand new world.</p>

  <p>"Alright, let's continue," Luo Zheng looked calm on the surface, but a storm was rising inside his chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>A large flow of chaotic energy surged like a tornado as it was drawn out of his chaotic sea and circulated violently inside his body.</p>
