<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>War Emperor York quickly looked back to the numerous times when he made Zheng's life hell and even wanted to put him to death� on more than one occasion.</p>

  <p>He thought it both funny and tragic that he was now on the verge of kneeling in front of that very same kid just to beg him to sprout more petals on that Lotus Flower of his.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York was the most ambitious among the kings which meant he was also the one who pined the most for ascension to the Upper World. Therefore, he couldn't help but feel so distraught yet also so hopeful as he watched the petals on Zheng's Lotus Flower unfurl one by one. Now that it had stopped blooming, War Emperor York was ready to get down on his knees to see just a few more petals from that lotus.</p>

  <p>He didn't really hold out hope at first since he thought it would be impossible for Zheng's lotus to have seven petals but he began to change his mind once he saw the flower reveal five.</p>

  <p>But now it had stopped blooming. He wanted to kneel, to cry, to beg, but that would be embarrassing given the animosity he and Luo Zheng had with each other. War Emperor York could only turn to Turner for help.</p>

  <p>He and Turner weren't really in the best of terms but the two were able to hold themselves back given the harmony that the four divine kingdoms enjoyed with each other.</p>

  <p>Still, Turner couldn't help but snort when he saw the embarrassed expression on War Emperor York's face. He shook his head before stepping down the pyramid and walking towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He wasn't doing it for War Emperor York. No, he was doing it for the sake of all Soul Sea Realm warriors of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Turner stopped several dozen feet away from Luo Zheng. The young man still hadn't completed his tribulation so Turner wasn't sure if he should get too close to him. "Tianxing, can you hear me? Er, I mean� Don't you think it's improper to sit and meditate while the Lotus Flower is blooming?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng opened his eyes and looked up at Turner, "What do you mean, your majesty?" he asked with a perplexed look. "Why is it improper?"</p>

  <p>"I mean�" Turner trailed off, not really sure how to explain this to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Just� maybe you should take it a bit more seriously?"</p>

  <p>Turner pointed at the Lotus Flower that slowly spun in the air.</p>

  <p>"Take it more seriously?" Luo Zheng repeated as he also looked at the flower.</p>

  <p>He understood what Turner had meant. They thought it quite halfhearted of him to meditate at this moment.</p>

  <p>The problem, however, was that Luo Zheng himself hadn't really planned on taking this seriously in the first place.</p>

  <p>According to the cyan dragon, the number of lotus petals was something that had already been predetermined by destiny. Luo Zheng had no control over how many petals would unfurl from the bulb.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the serious look on Turner's face was enough to make him feel a tiny bit embarrassed. Luo Zheng chuckled and got to his feet. Turner had taken care of him a lot so he had to show him some respect by taking this matter seriously. The Lotus Flower in the sky now had five petals and he couldn't help but wonder if the petals were significant to Turner and the others.</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't know that the number of petals was actually tied to the fates of those mighty Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The lotus in the sky continued to spin slowly, neither disappearing nor showing any indication of blooming more petals.</p>

  <p>This made the Soul Sea Realm warriors even more anxious.</p>

  <p>"Bloom, please! Please show us more petals!"</p>

  <p>"God, please let the flower bloom faster! All this waiting is torture!"</p>

  <p>"We've been waiting here for an hour but it feels like more than a year!"</p>

  <p>Now, one must understand that a Soul Sea Realm warrior had an average lifespan of around ten thousand years so an hour was like a brief, fleeting moment for them. However, each minute that had passed for the past hour had been extremely stressful for them while they waited for the Lotus Flower to bloom.</p>

  <p>It was only after two more hours that the Lotus Flower would once again tremble, indicating the appearance of another petal.</p>

  <p>"Oh dear god! Do you guys see this? The flower is continuing to bloom!" one Soul Sea Realm warrior shouted with excitement.</p>

  <p>The excitement came in the form of an intensely powerful sound wave. It was nothing to the other Soul Sea Realm warriors but it was enough to render a few young talents unconscious. Even Luo Zheng had to cover his ears.</p>

  <p>"Hey! What do you think you're doing?!" another Soul Sea Realm master berated. He looked at Luo Zheng with concern, afraid that the sound wave might've disturbed the young man.</p>

  <p>The raving warrior immediately realized his mistake. "F-F-Forgive me," he stammered. "I-I was too excited. I-I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"He's right. It is continuing to bloom," Turner mumbled.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was also excited but, unlike the warrior earlier, he made sure to keep his voice low.</p>

  <p>A sixth petal was slowly extending from the inside of the flower, unfurling like a delicate lady's finger. There was a certain beauty to it that captured the hearts of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Fiona couldn't help but stare in fascination at the sight, "This Lotus Flower is so beautiful!" she gushed.</p>

  <p>"Great! We now have some prospect of ascending to the Upper World!"</p>

  <p>"After so many years! I thought we were all doomed to die here in the Lower World. I never expected that this day would come."</p>

  <p>The excitement was overwhelming and many of the Soul Sea Realm warriors felt the waves of unprecedented happiness flood through their bodies.</p>

  <p>However, Derek was quick to douse their hopes with the cold, bitter reality, "You all forget that even if the Lotus Flower yields seven petals, the possibility of repairing the path to the Upper World would only rise to around thirty percent. Though a seven-petal Lotus Flower is indeed rare, repairing the path is more troublesome. It cannot be guaranteed."</p>

  <p>A path to the Upper World was normally repaired in the Lower World. If it was repaired from the Upper World then that would be what they'd call a "reverse repair." However, this "reverse repair" was a hundred times more difficult than the conventional way and the price was also higher.</p>

  <p>"Only thirty percent? Master Derek, maybe we can persuade them?</p>

  <p>Maybe we can�"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York, who had been so happy when he saw the sixth petal, found his mood plummeting as cold sweat trickled down his back.</p>

  <p>"You can what?" Derek scoffed. "What in this Divine Kingdom Continent is worthy of the Upper World's attention? Didn't you try to get that Ancestral Dragon egg for many years but never succeeded? This great world isn't really worthy of any attention!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York choked, "But�"</p>

  <p>Derek's words did make sense. No matter how much they stung, they made sense.</p>

  <p>The difference between the Upper World and Lower World was like that of a capital city and a small mountain village. Why would a lofty capital city ever pay attention to the matters of an insignificant village? They wouldn't even show any interest to a divine weapon!</p>

  <p>However, Derek spoke once again, "Do not worry. I will help as much as I can. Moreover, you will need to rely on the Holy Maiden to send this news to the Upper World."</p>

  <p>His words had everyone looking expectantly at Marine who nodded her head seriously, "I will also do my best�" Marine was very much aware that she was only a messenger. The one who truly held the reigns was still Master Derek.</p>

  <p>"The seventh petal has appeared!"</p>

  <p>While they had been talking, the seventh petal had decided to reveal itself.</p>

  <p>A Lotus Flower only had an odd number of petals. Since a sixth had appeared, they were sure that it would eventually be followed by a seventh. This was within their expectations.</p>

  <p>A Soul Sea Realm master couldn't help but sigh, "Ah� if only it could have two more petals�"</p>

  <p>His remark caused Derek to snort with laughter, "Ah! Yes, if only he could summon a Lotus Flower with nine petals. If that happened then the Upper World would have no choice but to pay attention! No matter how large the cost, they would surely repair the passageway!"</p>

  <p>His words caused a glimmer of hope to appear among the Soul Sea Realm warriors' faces.</p>

  <p>The ascension path was something that was too important for them. A seven-petal Lotus Flower only gave them a thirty percent chance but a nine-petal Lotus Flower could bump that figure to a hundred percent.</p>

  <p>They couldn't stop themselves from hoping that more petals would bloom.</p>

  <p>However, Derek was quick to shatter their hopes once again, "It is a pity.</p>

  <p>A Lotus Flower with nine petals is almost impossible. It is something that is rarely seen even in a supreme world. I'm not saying that Lower World warriors are inferior but I've never heard of one that could summon a Lotus Flower with nine petals."</p>

  <p>His words effectively calmed down those Soul Sea Realm warriors once they heard his conclusion.</p>

  <p>Of course, a better result would be nice, but looking forward to it too much might only lead to bitter disappointment especially if the chances were already too slim. It seemed that they had no choice but to resign themselves to their fate.</p>

  <p>How could they possibly expect a warrior from the Lower World to summon a Lotus Flower with all nine petals? It was preposterous.</p>

  <p>The thought had all of them reverting back to their calm, collected Soul Sea Realm master personas who now stared indifferently at the Lotus Flower that continued to rotate slowly in the air.</p>

  <p>Another two hours passed and, to everyone's shock, the flower started trembling once again!</p>
