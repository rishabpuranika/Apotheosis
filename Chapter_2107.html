  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavens-suppressing Object had already escaped Master Feng's control.</p>

  <p>It had now merged with Luo Zheng's Lotus Flower that had already bloomed.</p>

  <p>This meant that Luo Luo Zheng had to reopen this Evolution Lotus Flower again.</p>

  <p>This Evolution Lotus Flower had never been opened ever since Master Feng had carried the Heavenly Destiny and obtained the Heavens-suppressing Object.</p>

  <p>The Heavens-suppressing Objects were originally precious weapons to the Holy Beings. Only Holy Beings had the right to use them. Letting the strongest Supreme Lord in the universe obtain the Heavens-suppressing Object as a treasure was a common convention among the Holy Beings, but that did not mean that they could use it as they wished.</p>

  <p>Irrespective of whether it was Master Feng or the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race, they could only display a fraction of the Heavens-suppressing Object's true strength.</p>

  <p>Master Feng watched the Evolution Lotus Flower fly away, and with a casual wave of his hand, opened a space crack. In the blink of an eye, he and Wynn had walked into it and appeared beside Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This Evolution Lotus Flower... It is blooming!" Master Feng's face was filled with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Wynn, on the other hand, was calm. "The Evolution Divine Dao is ranked at the 13th place, a high place among the three thousand Divine Dao in the divine land. But very few people cultivate this Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>There are countless True Gods in the vast divine land. But there have only been fewer than a hundred people who have cultivated the Evolution Divine Dao since the ancient times until now. Do you know why?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng didn't have a great understanding of the divine land. The information he had obtained so far came from both Wynn and his own blood. Now that he had heard the story of the Evolution Lotus Flower, he asked, "Why?"</p>

  <p>"The chaos is an entirety. You have heard of the Evolutionary Fifty, right? It originated in ancient times," Wynn said.</p>

  <p>Master Feng knew what the Evolutionary Fifty meant and carried a Heavenly Destiny, but he did not know the logic behind it. His head spun as he listened to Wynn's explanation. "I wonder what sort of a relationship your words have with the number of people cultivating the Evolution Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>Wynn laughed and replied, "This is because this Divine Dao is an attempt to generalize the entire chaos, which is the entire space outside of the divine land."</p>

  <p>"The entire chaos..." Master Feng's eyes lit up as his thoughts drifted.</p>

  <p>As far as mortals were concerned, the great world was already vast enough and without end. One wouldn't even be able to see the edges of the world for the rest of their life.</p>

  <p>When Master Feng had cultivated to the Soul Sea Realm, he had felt that the supreme worlds were very large, each equal to a thousand great worlds. It would take several hundred years for some martial artists to travel across a supreme world.</p>

  <p>Once he had reached the level of a world lord, he began to feel that a supreme world was too small and that it would only take a few days to cross it. What was really large was the universe. A universe might contain 100, 000 supreme worlds, 1, 000, 000 great worlds, and an endless starry sky.</p>

  <p>Now that he had become a Supreme Lord, the universe was nothing more than this, in his opinion. The greatest and most massive place should technically be the divine land.</p>

  <p>But now, Master Feng knew that there was an endless chaos outside of the divine land. The boundaries of this chaos were nearly impossible to explore. It was not only the infinite of the space, but also the infinite of the mind.</p>

  <p>"If chaos can be generalized, it means that it has a boundary," Master Feng muttered after thinking for a while. "Then what is outside the boundary?"</p>

  <p>Wynn smiled and said, "Good question. This is a paradoxical question that even the Holy Beings cannot answer. Or rather, the Holy Beings' understanding of chaos is still in a period of obscurity. If you ask me, a majority of Holy Beings who say that they roam the chaos, other than the few who will never return, are just circling around the divine land."</p>

  <p>Master Feng didn't know what to say at Wynn's evaluation. Wynn continued, "From ancient times until now, the tablet of the Evolution Divine Dao is probably one that has been observed by the least number of martial artists.</p>

  <p>This is besides those few prohibited tablets."</p>

  <p>Every single tablet of the three thousand Divine Dao recorded the name of the first person who had comprehended the Divine Dao in remote ages.</p>

  <p>Most of them were martial artists belonging to the Sacred race, because the Sacred race had been the first race to flourish in the divine land. It had disappeared, true, but the names of those that had comprehended the Divine Dao in remote ages still existed.</p>

  <p>Only Mike's name remained on the tablet of the Evolution Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>This was because Mike had been the first person to comprehend the Evolution Divine Dao in the ancient times. Not only had he comprehended it, he had also used the Divine Dao to become a Holy Being and had created an unimaginable miracle in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Because of how Mike's legend had spread, the Evolution Divine Dao, which no one had cared about before, became very popular.</p>

  <p>Which True God would not be tempted if one could cultivate the Divine Dao to become a Holy Being?</p>

  <p>However, it was not easy to cultivate the Evolution Divine Dao. It had been popular for a while before news about it had petered out. Most True Gods had given up. Only a very few people had comprehended the mysteries of the tablet, but in the end, they had been unable to achieve the same level as Mike had. Moreover, there wasn't another person who had become a Holy Being just by relying on this Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"My master spent his entire life exploring the Evolution Divine Dao. It is precisely because of this that he-" Wynn couldn't continue, having been overcome with emotion.</p>

  <p>At the time, it had been such a great honor for him to have been accepted as Mike's disciple.</p>

  <p>Even Harold, who had been famous for a long time, had willingly become Mike's disciple. Now that it had ended like this, Wynn naturally felt sad.</p>

  <p>But he knew very well that his master had not given up, and that he had seen hope in Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He knew that his Master wanted to truly pass on his legacy.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Evolution Lotus Flower had not stopped blooming.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower petals did not bloom bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Instead, they spread out simultaneously in all directions, like the tentacles of an octopus.</p>

  <p>From the center of the Lotus Flower emerged a fresh, tender stamen, specks of light coiling around it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his head and observed the scene before him. Master Feng had only understood a little of what Wynn had explained but Luo Luo Zheng hadn't even heard the explanation. Which was why he was still confused by what he saw.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng instinctively understood that whatever was happening before him must be related to his father's arrangements. And he would gladly accept it, no matter what happened.</p>

  <p>The faint light surrounding the stamen was like a firefly the size of a grain of rice. It circled around the lotus petals and sprinkled down towards Luo Luo Zheng, enveloping him in a drizzle.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a gentle force on his face, blowing against his cheek.</p>

  <p>This feeling of laziness tired him out a little. His eyelids felt like they weighed a thousand pounds and they then closed. It was not long before he entered dreamland.</p>

  <p>"Of the Evolutionary Fifty, only forty-nine are useful. Of the Evolutionary Fifty, separate one into two. One is variable, and the other one is definite!" a grave voice echoed.</p>

  <p>'I've heard those words before.' Luo Luo Zheng still had clear thoughts as if he was conscious, even though he was still dreaming.</p>

  <p>Irene had said this back in the Illusion Battlefield, but no one, including Luo Luo Zheng, had been able to figure out the meaning of this phrase.</p>

  <p>"The Evolution Divine Dao is the origin of counting-"</p>

  <p>The grave voice continued to speak. Luo Luo Zheng did not understand these words and could only engrave them into his heart, one word at a time.</p>

  <p>It was a while before the voice finally stopped. Luo Zheng's heart was suddenly filled with clarity and he discovered that he now seemed to have a profound understanding of the Evolution Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>This wasn't an epiphany on Luo Zheng's part, but a natural epiphany that followed the grave voice.</p>

  <p>Only now did Luo Luo Zheng understand his father's painstaking arrangements.</p>

  <p>This was the legacy his father had left him.</p>

  <p>    </p>
