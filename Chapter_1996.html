<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This crazy chaos continued for a long time.</p>

  <p>At the end of the Bloody Plain were stationed the ogre martial artists.</p>

  <p>Facing the invasion of the Demon Night race, the ogres were under great pressure. Although they had tried their best to kill the Demon Night soldiers, the two queens and the Supreme Lords were much stronger than they were.</p>

  <p>If the Demon Night race captured the Bloody Evil World, the ogres would have no way of retreating. They would probably have to abandon their territory and seek refuge with the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the ogres had placed a large number of troops in the Bloody Evil World, in their best attempt at stopping the Demon Night race from marching forward in the Bloody Plain.</p>

  <p>The army led by Yao was already quite powerful, though. With the reinforcements from another army of her race, the Bloody Evil World probably wouldn't be able to hold them off for very long.</p>

  <p>Now, the ogre leaders were gathered together, discussing their battle strategy.</p>

  <p>"We need to inflict heavy casualties on the Demon Night army before the reinforcements from the Queen of Life arrive. Only then will we have the chance to thoroughly defend ourselves against them," a golden-haired ogre grand world lord mentioned.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias didn't say a word. To the ogres, this was very risky. And as Supreme Lords, they couldn't afford to die here because they were the decisive force of their race.</p>

  <p>If they didn't take any risks though, their chances of survival would be extremely small. If this whole situation continued to drag on, they would most likely lose the battle.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias had no other choice but to ultimately make a difficult decision. Just as he gave his first order to attack, however, one of his spies delivered a piece of news he hadn't heard before.</p>

  <p>"Report! The Demon Night race has collapsed without battle. Their soldiers are now frantically running away!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this news, all the ogre leaders present couldn't help but become shocked and confused.</p>

  <p>How was this even possible?</p>

  <p>During the battle with the Demon Night race, the ogres had become well aware that their enemies were not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Most of the Demon Night members weren't very talkative, but they were all cold-blooded assassins who weren't afraid of death or pain. They were willing to sacrifice themselves for their race.</p>

  <p>The ogres, on the other hand, were known for their bravery. After the outbreak of the all-out war with the Demon Night race, compared to the warriors of the Demon Night race, the ogres were as weak as kittens.</p>

  <p>In reality though, it wasn't that the ogres were too weak, but that the Demon Night race was too reckless.</p>

  <p>How could such a race suddenly collapse and flee? No one understood.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias' face was filled with disbelief. His massive figure suddenly shot toward the sky, tearing apart the wide tent in an instant.</p>

  <p>His large eyes gazed into the distance, and his expression changed from disbelief to cheer.</p>

  <p>From his position, he could clearly see the warriors of the Demon Night race fleeing toward the other side of the Bloody Plain. The news they had just received was true.</p>

  <p>The other grand world lords also flew upward, gazing into the distance.</p>

  <p>From there, if they wanted to see the absolute end of the plain, they would need to use some token.</p>

  <p>Their faces quickly changed into expressions of joy and happiness too.</p>

  <p>"Is the Demon Night race bewitched?"</p>

  <p>"I just can't believe that they would actually run away."</p>

  <p>"Did something happen on the Bloody Plain, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>The grand world lords began taking their guesses one after the other.</p>

  <p>"This is a one of a kind opportunity. Let's chase after them and kill them all!" one of the grand world lords was shouting with excitement, his eyes gleaming.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias simply shook his head. "We can't. It's highly possible that this is one of their tricks."</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Mathias is right! The Demon Night race has many tricks up their sleeves. If they lure us in deep, we may get ourselves into deeper trouble," another grand world lord echoed, nodding in agreement.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, now that the Demon Night race seemed to be fleeing, it certainly was an opportunity for the ogres to chase after them and kill them. On the other hand though, taking such action was too risky, and they therefore decided to hold off and wait.</p>

  <p>They continued watching and before long, most of the Demon Night soldiers had fled.</p>

  <p>In the end, only a few hundred warriors were left.</p>

  <p>These people were the core members of the Saint Chain Sect. They were absolutely loyal to Yao. They worshiped her, but now, even they didn't dare approach her palace.</p>

  <p>Yao, on her behalf, was still standing alone on top of the Purple Feather Tree. Her azure eyes stared into the distance, her face filled with desolation. Her long skirt fluttered in the gentle breeze, causing her to feel an unprecedented chill.</p>

  <p>After a while, she jumped down from the tree and landed on the ground like a bolt of lightning. She glanced at her trusted follower and the killing intent on her face became even stronger. "Tell Shania that we're going back home."</p>

  <p>"My queen, if we go back now..." one of her subordinates was trying to speak up.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A Thunder Law, thicker than anyone had ever seen, lashed downward like a dragon's tooth, hitting the speaker. She instantly turned to charcoal, still standing motionlessly like a burnt log.</p>

  <p>As the other subordinates watched the scene unfold before them, their eyes began to twitch and bulge fiercely, but no one dared to move an inch, for fear that their queen would get even angrier.</p>

  <p>Yao's expression didn't change in the slightest, though. All she wanted to do now was vent her anger on Leroy like he deserved!</p>
