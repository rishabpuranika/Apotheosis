<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng's question met a ringing silence from all the warriors of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race guarded the strength source, while the Skyland race possessed the Pristine Life Vitality.</p>

  <p>Everything in this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was formed by life vitality. The Skyland race was where the vitality between heaven and earth had originated from.</p>

  <p>With such a unique advantage, the Skyland race's talent in using the life vitality was far greater than that of the other races.</p>

  <p>Their techniques of using life vitality to activate various laws were, obviously, ingenious.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Skyland race, Kaydan was undoubtedly very powerful. He had already activated the Fire Law and pushed it to its limit, but with no effect on Zheng.</p>

  <p>What was even more surprising was that Zheng wasn't moving at all! It looked like he was withstanding Kaydan's flame effortlessly, cutting an impressive figure as he stood there.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Zheng had never taken the Skyland race seriously.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Kaydan started to believe Chapman's words.</p>

  <p>This guy really had obtained the title of wild king, and his real strength was perhaps even more than that.</p>

  <p>But he had spoken so arrogantly to him before. And as the leader of the Skyland race, he was now caught in an embarrassing situation.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for him to arrange an assassin to kill Zheng. Chapman would be the first one to oppose it.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the flame could do no harm to Zheng, Kaydan had no choice but to make it dissipate. He then snorted and said, "I hope you really are as strong as Chapman has claimed! Or the Emerald Flame would have burned you to ashes!"</p>

  <p>"You don't have to worry about that," Zheng said with a soft chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Remember, I am only cooperating with the Collapsing Mountain race."</p>

  <p>Kaydan's face darkened at his words, but Chapman continued to ease the situation. At the same time, he agreed with Zheng, "That's right. Our Collapsing Mountain race and Zheng are cooperating with each other.</p>

  <p>Kaydan, you shouldn't be so rude."</p>

  <p>"Chapman, you!"</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race had cooperated with an martial artist from another race? Kaydan doubted if Zheng was powerful enough to work with them.</p>

  <p>Even when Pascal had become the leader of the Collapsing Mountain race, many warriors in the race had opposed it. The six races in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were essentially very xenophobic.</p>

  <p>For example, there were often warriors in the Collapsing Mountain race who demanded to seal off the Sacred Spring Mountain and forbid the martial artists of other races from entering it.</p>

  <p>This had often happened in the Skyland race, Kaleidoscope race, and other races in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>But the rules of the six great sacred places for cultivation were set up by the prophets, and the prophets followed the orders of the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. It was impossible for them to attempt to change the rules.</p>

  <p>So even though the six great races were xenophobic, they still had to unwillingly accept martial artists from other races to cultivate, and provide assistance to help them improve themselves.</p>

  <p>This reluctance deepened the aboriginals' xenophobia. Deep down in their bones, they believed that the martial artists from other races were here to take advantage of them.</p>

  <p>Now that Chapman had confirmed that the Collapsing Mountain race was cooperating with Zheng, to Kaydan, it felt like an act of degrading themselves. He had thought he had misheard it at first. But as he thought back to Chapman's behavior and opinions throughout it all, Kayden realized that it wasn't that strange at all.</p>

  <p>As he watched realization dawn on Kaydan's face, Chapman sighed. He strode forward and whispered something in Kaydan's ear.</p>

  <p>Kaydan's expression changed again as he listened to what Chapman had to say and then stared intently at Zheng. His face gradually softened, and his attitude underwent a complete shift as his tone became extremely courteous. "That explains it. It looks like our Skyland race has benefited from the cooperation between our respected friend Zheng and the Collapsing Mountain race. I realize that I spoke rudely and might have offended you. Please don't take it to heart."</p>

  <p>The senior leaders of the Skyland race watched, their jaws almost hitting the ground.</p>

  <p>What had Chapman said that had caused their leader's attitude to undergo such a drastic change in the span of a few seconds?</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Skyland race had no idea what had happened. But Zheng knew what was happening. And so did some of the more astute warriors.</p>

  <p>Chapman had probably told Kaydan about their encounter with the Martial Sacred Beast.</p>

  <p>As the spiritual pet of the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Martial Sacred Beast had an extraordinary status. Not only had Zheng confronted the Martial Sacred Beast head on, the Black Weasel had even chosen to take the initiative to leave.</p>

  <p>Just this fact alone was enough to prove that Zheng was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Although the Black Weasel couldn't speak any human language, it wasn't unintelligent. The fact that it had let Zheng go was already very abnormal.</p>

  <p>It was probably worth their time to consider the reason behind it.</p>

  <p>Who could have driven the Black Weasel to make such a decision? Only the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land!</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Collapsing Mountain race did not know the purpose of the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Even the prophets had kept it a secret. However, Chapman and some others had their own guesses.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, Kaydan had no choice but to brace himself and change his attitude, even though it was a little awkward.</p>

  <p>When Kaydan backed down, Zheng didn't plan to continue making things difficult for him. He only nodded and said, "It's just a small misunderstanding. Please just forget it."</p>

  <p>Kaydan might have put his pride aside, but the other warriors of the Skyland race weren't about to. They didn't know what had happened and they simply hated Zheng for it.</p>

  <p>Once this was over, it was time for the meal.</p>

  <p>When the Collapsing Mountain race came to visit, the Skyland race usually treated them with abundant food.</p>

  <p>Kaydan waved his hand, and dozens of Skyland race members flew over.</p>

  <p>In their hands were piles of exquisite plates and wine cups, which they placed one by one before the guests.</p>

  <p>But the plates were empty.</p>

  <p>Zheng was curious as he looked at the plate before him. Just what food was the Skyland race going to serve them?</p>

  <p>Since this was a sacred land for cultivating life vitality, the martial artists here cultivated life vitality and didn't need to eat food. They could just devour the vitality between heaven and earth to sustain themselves.</p>

  <p>What happened next confirmed Zheng's deduction.</p>

  <p>The Skyland race was indeed different from the Collapsing Mountain race. The Collapsing Mountain race needed to hunt a large number of rare and unique beasts for food, the flesh and blood of which would help the warriors greatly in refining their bodies.</p>

  <p>But the food of the Skyland race was life vitality!</p>

  <p>Once the plates were put in place, a dozen women of the Skyland race appeared.</p>

  <p>These women were slim and beautiful, in great contrast to the tall and sturdy women of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Martial artists from other races drooled as they saw these women, feeling that they were beautiful enough that they could feast their eyes upon them.</p>

  <p>The ladies had their hands clasped together before the plates and closed their eyes in meditation.</p>

  <p>'The spiritual projection technique!' Zheng gasped, surprised.</p>

  <p>As the women imagined through techniques of meditation, the rich life vitality in this place began to condense. Emerald green lights began to flicker from the plates and a fragrance began to waft through the place.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, all sorts of fruits and meat appeared on the plates, the cups filling with fragrant wine.</p>

  <p>Zheng was speechless.</p>

  <p>The spiritual projection technique was a method to control life vitality at the entry level.</p>

  <p>But when martial artists cultivated, they could devour life vitality and directly absorb the vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>The Skyland race had maintained their tradition of eating meals, but they did not eat minced meat or grains. They used the spiritual projection technique to serve the purpose.</p>

  <p>These beautiful women were the cooks of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>The spiritual projection technique they had cultivated since they were young was to imagine all kinds of delicacies.</p>

  <p>The best food in the world was still in one's imagination. After all, people's imagination was a wonderful thing.</p>

  <p>Under the constant training, the food they came up with through spiritual projection became exceptionally rare delicacies.</p>

  <p>Of course, the food was only a mass of life vitality. It was similar to absorbing the vitality between heaven and earth when it was gulped down. The only difference was that it could satisfy one's appetite.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I miss the delicacies of the Skyland race every day. Although this food couldn't fill my stomach, its taste is first class! We'll eat this first, and then we'll divide the prey!" Chapman smiled, impatient to get his hands on the plate.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race didn't absorb life vitality. To them, eating all this food was the same as not eating it at all. But the delicacies of the Skyland race had always been tempting to them. They had had a good harvest in the journey through the Calamity Dispelling Forest. That prey could wait. What they wanted to do right now was satisfy their taste buds.</p>

  <p>Once the woman of the Skyland race had finished her meditation, she turned to Zheng and bowed. "Please enjoy your meal," she said and walked towards the next martial artist.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before every plate was filled with all sorts of delicacies.</p>

  <p>Zheng was curious since Chapman had praised the food so much. He took a few grapes and popped them into his mouth. Sweetness exploded on his tongue. The rich sweetness wasn't cloying but was completely different from what he had experienced before.</p>

  <p>He swallowed the food and once it entered his stomach, Zheng could feel it turn into life vitality that began to enter his inner world. But the moment it entered, it was instantly annihilated by the chaotic energy. His inner world had long since been unable to contain life vitality.</p>
