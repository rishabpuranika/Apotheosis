<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wasn't only Malcom who was shocked at the scene. Fabian and Esther were equally taken aback.</p>

  <p>Zheng's black flame appeared almost invincible upon exploding. It had even burnt the tongue of the Bull-like Giant Toad.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful the Bull-like Giant Toad was, it was still flesh and blood. It was less shocking that the black flame could burn the toad like that. But the sword in front of them was definitely something stronger than a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>It could even be a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Although no one was sure, they could guess it was a divine weapon. But Zheng's black flame had even started to smelt the sword! And that too, in a very brief time!</p>

  <p>To Esther and the others, it seemed like an unbelievably fast speed, while to Zheng, it seemed rather slow.</p>

  <p>Earlier in time, when any weapon was burnt by the black flame, a gentle flick of the flame was enough to burn all the impurities of the weapon. But this sword was different. It had resisted the black flame for a few seconds before it started to melt down completely. Parallel to that, a lot of heavenly essence started to fly towards Zheng like water running in a stream.</p>

  <p>"That is a lot of heavenly essence!</p>

  <p>"Wow! This heavenly essence can be used to refine weapons!" Fabian exclaimed.</p>

  <p>But there wasn't a single weapon refiner present at the scene. The heavenly essence was rare, but it wasn't of much use for any unskilled, normal person.</p>

  <p>While Zheng continued smelting the sword further, a small hole started to appear right at its center, gradually growing bigger and bigger. Finally, it grew as wide as the width of the sword and the bottom half of the sword turned into a burning, viscous liquid.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, the upper half fell on the ground with a loud bang, piercing it while causing a deep fissure into it.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not even glance at it as he continued to smelt the remains of the sword, his eyes focused on what was now an undulating surface. The amount of heavenly essence produced by this sword was equivalent to that created by millions of fairy weapons combined! It flowed towards Zheng in torrents and he collected it without letting any of it go to waste.</p>

  <p>Zheng's increased strength would also have an effect on the power of the dragon scales, making them much more important. If used correctly at critical times, the power of the dragon scales could produce a miraculous effect.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had also established the Hundred Meetings Platform in his body and gone through body refinement, his physique had improved impressively. With his new form and the posture that came with it, he could withstand even greater strength.</p>

  <p>As he smelt the sword with all his force, in his mind he asked the cyan dragon, "What will happen if I light up all the dragon scales?"</p>

  <p>Until now, he had only lit up a few dragon scales, and he had never imagined lighting all of them at all. He couldn't even have imagined how much heavenly essence it would take to do such a task.</p>

  <p>But now, he understood that a sacred weapon contained exponentially higher amount of heavenly essence than any fairy weapon. If he continued to smelt more of these, he could get a chance to light up all the dragon scales in the future.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon laughed before answering, "If you light up all the dragon scales, then you'd be able to help me rebuild my Heavenly Body."</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Body?"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon then let out a faint sigh and explained, "When you first lit up the dragon scales, I didn't imagine you growing to this level some day.</p>

  <p>When my and my eight brothers' souls were suppressed by this furnace, our bodies were completely destroyed. The heavenly essence comes from the weapon refiners' comprehension of the Heavenly Law. If you help us rebuild our Heavenly Bodies, we might be able to come back to lives."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon's words seemed to contain a complicated emotion. To rebuild the Heavenly Body was something that he could not even dare to think about. But after he realized that Zheng had the capacity to lead this world of chaos, he knew that it was highly likely that Zheng would help him and his brothers to rebuild their Heavenly Bodies.</p>

  <p>As Zheng continued to grow in strength, the possibility of getting back whatever they'd lost was becoming realer.</p>

  <p>How could the cyan dragon not be moved to hope?</p>

  <p>"Thanks a lot, Zheng!" the cyan dragon said sincerely.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face broke into a smile. "You don't need to thank me. I also need to borrow the power of the dragon scales. Furthermore, I don't even know how long it will take for me to light up all the dragon scales," he said.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I don't think it will take a long time," the cyan dragon said, convinced it wouldn't be long before Zheng became a powerful warrior. As long as he didn't die in the process, it wouldn't be difficult for him to obtain heavenly essence in the future. And once that happened, it wouldn't even be too difficult to light the scales of all the other Genuine Dragons, not just light up the cyan dragon's.</p>

  <p>Just then, a voice sounded in Zheng's mind. "Hey Zheng, you've already helped him light up so many dragon scales. How about helping me light some now?"</p>

  <p>This voice was the red dragon's. He was the cyan dragon's seventh elder brother.</p>

  <p>Zheng chuckled in response and replied calmly, "There's no rush. I'll help the cyan dragon light up all the dragon scales before helping you!"</p>

  <p>The red dragon was only joking. If Zheng could light up all of the cyan dragon's scales and help rebuild his Heavenly Body, he would be able to recover to his full strength. Although the cyan dragon was the weakest of the nine dragons, he was after all a super legendary beast. After all his dragon scales were lit up, he would be able to help Zheng a lot.</p>

  <p>And so, the most important thing right now was to help the cyan dragon light up all the dragon scales and rebuild his Heavenly Body before helping the other dragons.</p>

  <p>Under the heat of the black flame, the sword finally came to an end, and all the heavenly essence got stored in Zheng's space ring.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of everyone who was present, this giant sword was already comparable to a divine weapon. It was indeed a bit of a waste for Zheng to have smelted it completely. But nobody could take it away anyway, and hence they only watched its destruction helplessly in awe.</p>

  <p>About an hour later, the task was finally done to the end. Satisfied, Zheng stood up and said to Esther and the others, "We can all set off now!"</p>

  <p>Yolande looked at Zheng without saying a word.</p>

  <p>Everyone continued to walk forward again.</p>

  <p>Along the way, they could see skeletons and massive holes in the ground, along with numerous potholes all about the path. When they looked at the scarred and ruined ground, they could sense how terrible the battle would've been. Nobody knew how many powerful warriors had died fighting in the battle!</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng and his companions touched the skeletons, they turned to dust, which was ironic as the owners of those skeletons would have been even stronger than the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Malcom, Rehaan, and Shane kept looking around with their eyes wide open, waiting for opportunities. They were sure to rush up to it if they found something unusual. Since they were in the core area and Yolande said she could lead them to leave the place, they were keen on finding as many opportunities as possible.</p>

  <p>However, Malcom and the others were very disappointed to not come across anything decent. They did manage to find some weapons, but they were all broken and decrepit. The heavenly essence of these weapons had long vanished, leaving nothing behind but a pile of waste metal.</p>

  <p>In the end, they might as well have been collecting garbage, as they did not find anything substantial.</p>

  <p>As they continued their search and advanced forward, they started to feel eerily uncomfortable as if something was off in the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>And then they realized that the Dark Nether Death Light was getting stronger and stronger!</p>

  <p>The red dot in the sky was already the size of a wheel. Even with the multiple layers of fog blocking the red dot, the Dark Nether Death Light was able to exert and multiply the pressure on everyone's protective life vitality.</p>

  <p>Although everyone's life vitality could withstand it, the consumption rate was becoming faster and faster. In a very short period of time, Fabian had already taken out two supreme life vitality crystals, crushed them and absorbed the life vitality within to supplement himself.</p>

  <p>Malcom and Rehaan were even more troubled. They were body refiners, and relied on the protection of the forceful energy, which couldn't be replenished with life vitality crystals. It could only be generated by their own bodies slowly.</p>

  <p>It was alright in the beginning as the pressure of the Dark Nether Death Light wasn't too great and the consumption of forceful energy was minimal in its comparison. Malcom and Rehaan could withstand the Dark Nether Death Light with their powerful bodies alone, and did not need the protection of their forceful energy.</p>

  <p>But as they got closer and closer to the red dot, the Dark Nether Death Light became more intense, leaving them no choice but to use their forceful energy to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>They were not worried at the beginning. After all, the speed at which the forceful energy was generated within their bodies was faster than the speed at which the forceful energy was consumed.</p>

  <p>But it was now becoming very troublesome for them to maintain a balance between the two. They were unable to replenish the forceful energy in time, and were slowly running out of it.</p>

  <p>Once the entirety of their forceful energy was used up, their bodies would directly be facing the increasingly intense and deadly Dark Nether Death Light with no protection.</p>

  <p>That was almost like standing naked in a world full of flames, or a world full of ice! How could they possibly resist and get away alive with something like that?</p>
