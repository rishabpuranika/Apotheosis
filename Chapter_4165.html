  <p>
</p>

  <p>Unique creatures were living in the boundless chaos, and the Chaos Winged Beast was one of them.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beasts lived in groups and were ferocious. They launched violent attacks on any other creature approaching their lairs.</p>

  <p>The lairs floated like huge cages in the chaos.</p>

  <p>These lairs were also living creatures. They had extremely special sensitivity to creatures from afar.</p>

  <p>Once they did, they would emit a faint stench that guided the Chaos Winged Beasts to find their targets.</p>

  <p>If the sensed creatures were powerful, the lairs would emit a stronger stench. This served as a warning, reminding the Chaos Winged Beasts to avoid those creatures that inhabited the chaos.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The falling crystals absorbed the chaotic energy, turning into huge heads floating in the chaos. A rotten smell started to fill the lairs as if a corpse had been decaying for days.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beasts that stayed inside the lairs felt nauseated from the stench and came out.</p>

  <p>The smell reminded the Chaos Winged Beasts that terrifying creatures had been surrounding them.</p>

  <p>When the Chaos Winged Beasts flapped their wings and soared from their lairs, the sight stupefied them.</p>

  <p>Many huge heads drifted around. A strong sense of crisis radiated from them even though they didn't move.</p>

  <p>"Waah..."</p>

  <p>"Waah... Waah..."</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beasts communicated with each other.</p>

  <p>Any creature had a way of living. If it didn't, it could have already been extinct.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beasts didn't choose to attack the heads rashly. They sent dozens of subordinates to check instead.</p>

  <p>The subordinates cautiously approached the heads and evaluated them.</p>

  <p>The heads did not emit any aura of life. They only closed their eyes tightly like huge static rocks that appeared to be dead.</p>

  <p>"Woo, woo..."</p>

  <p>One of the Chaos Winged Beasts shouted and drew closer to one of the heads. It stretched out its sharp claw, gently touching it.</p>

  <p>When the tip of its claw landed on the head's surface, its eyes opened suddenly.</p>

  <p>A blinding light blazed from the pair of huge eyes. The head opened its monstrous mouth, attempting to swallow the Chaos Winged Beasts.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beasts were fast. As they discovered the danger, they instantly flapped their wings and turned into streaks of black light to escape. However, it was too late? the huge mouth had sucked them all.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beasts were barely enough to fill the gaps of its teeth.</p>

  <p>Its eyes quickly locked onto the lairs, spotting more to eat. More than ten lairs were connected, and in the blink of an eye, the head devoured them all.</p>

  <p>However, the head still felt hungry. To consistently enhance its strength, it needed to swallow everything that could be swallowed. But what more was left to devour in the empty chaos?</p>

  <p>Soon, it began to target its kind.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>It flew towards another head and bit it hard. The other head woke up and was provoked to bite back. Both of them tried to devour each other.</p>

  <p>One of the heads was completely gobbled up by the other, doubling the size of the surviving head.</p>

  <p>At this point, the head still felt hungry. It fixed its eyes on the next head.</p>

  <p>With its advantage in size, it was easier for other heads to fall into its prey.</p>

  <p>It then started to devour other heads.</p>

  <p>The heads that filled the chaos woke up in various forms and set off devouring each other crazily.</p>

  <p>The heads that woke up first grew stronger exponentially and stood out from trillions of heads.</p>

  <p>However, the ones to grow fastest in the chaos were not them, but the Burial Land on its corner.</p>

  <p>From the moment the heads were born, the three big mouths at the edges of the Burial Land already began to devour them. It grew larger every time it swallowed a head.</p>

  <p>After the Burial Land devoured all the heads around it, its size expanded more than ten times.</p>

  <p>As the size of the Burial Land continued to increase, the speed at which it devoured the heads also doubled. Its three mouths opened as wide as a whale's as they devoured the heads.</p>

  <p>However, the Burial Land was still too small. Although it was also a primitive land, it had never been paid attention to by the Snake Spirit King. Even though it had expanded more than ten times, it was still not as big as a province in the Source World.</p>

  <p>When the crystals landed around the Source World, they turned the chaos clouds into huge heads.</p>

  <p>As the heads awakened, they did not take their companions as first targets.</p>

  <p>The huge Source World beside them was enough. Without hesitation, they swarmed towards the Source World.</p>

  <p>The outer wall of the Source World was several hundred miles thick.</p>

  <p>Although the heads devoured at a fast speed, it would still take a long time for them to enter the Source World.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the Evil God floated atop a mountain. In front of him was a ball of colorful Ways-blending Energy. Although the Ways-blending Energy was only the size of a fist, it was highly condensed for an explosion enough to destroy large provinces.</p>

  <p>After the Li Shan mountain successfully escaped, the Evil God placed his avatars in all the large provinces in the Source World. He visited the major forces and announced to them that he was the ruler of the Source World.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God released the evil intent that spread throughout the Source World, all the super forces and great forces already speculated the presence of a ruler. The Evil God's appearance confirmed their intuition.</p>

  <p>These forces could not separate a large province from the Source World like the Li Shan mountain did. They had no other choice but to surrender to the Evil God who came to them.</p>

  <p>However, other than making them surrender to him, the Evil God did not take any further action. To him, the creatures in the Source World were no different from ants. Even the several powerful warriors at the Eternal Realm were only slightly stronger ants.</p>

  <p>The giant ape that suddenly appeared when the Li Shan mountain left the Source World lingered in the Evil God's thoughts. He asked the former captain to inquire from the Grandmaster of Heaven about the giant ape's origin.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what had happened on the Other Shore. The Grandmaster of Heaven and his people seemed to have disappeared without any response.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had to rely on himself.</p>

  <p>Realizing that there was such a terrifying creature in this world, the Evil God became more eager to enhance his strength.</p>

  <p>On one hand, he wanted to further strengthen his control over the Source World, but on the other, he needed to comprehend the truth power from the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>His control over the Source World gradually increased. It wasn't difficult for him to completely control everything, but when he comprehended the Ways-blending Energy, he encountered unsolvable problems.</p>

  <p>In a short period, he had already understood the embryos of the truth power from the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>The six embryos corresponded to the abilities of the six Chaos Ancient Gods. However, other than the truth power, the Evil God had captured something unusual in the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>He was lost in thought for several days.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Edna walked down the ship and draped a black robe that she made over the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stared at the Ways-blending Energy in front of him and muttered, "The power of the Ways-blending Energy is not just about the six kinds of truth power. It should have been thousands of times stronger now. Why is it so weak in my hands? This shouldn't be..."</p>

  <p>Edna couldn't help but shake her head at her husband's situation.</p>

  <p>Her husband was already the ruler of the Source World. Even the leaders of the super forces had already surrendered to him, but he was still obsessed with strength. She pondered whether it was good or bad.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God was concentrating, he suddenly heard a strange sound from the Source World. He frowned as he directed his sight to the outer wall. His eyes reflected the heads that were frantically devouring it. He raised his eyebrows, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"What are they?"</p>
