<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1259 The Purple Jade Building </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The woman in the purple robe was jealous but she didn't let it mess with her mind. She thought that Xi Youqin's ability of controlling the swords was amazing. Moreover, since Mu Ning could use millions of giant swords at will, her Purple Power Body must surely be at a high grade.</p>

  <p>As she thought this, the woman in the purple robe controlled the large ship and descended slowly.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was enjoying playing with the swords. As her eyes flashed, she pulled them out one by one from the slowly spinning whirlpool. They came together to form words in the air.</p>

  <p>"In the cold, long night, only loneliness comes to me when I think of you."</p>

  <p>As Mu Ning gazed at the sentence in the sky, her eyes turned wistful.</p>

  <p>She might look happy as she played, but she still couldn't drive away the loneliness in her heart.</p>

  <p>The woman in purple had already left the large ship. As she looked up at the words, a sneer took place on her face. "Such a pathetic woman!" she muttered acidly.</p>

  <p>She fumed inwardly for a while as she thought and then said to Mu Ning,</p>

  <p>"With your talent, you can choose any outstanding man in the entire universe once you achieve your cultivation. Why do you have to be so miserable?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had been too focused to notice the large ship and the woman in purple. But at the woman's words, she turned and took a long look at her before saying, "No matter how outstanding the other men are, they won't ever match up to him."</p>

  <p>"Other men are inferior to him? I don't believe that," the woman in purple said disdainfully. According to her, Mu Ning only had a cultivation base that was at the Internal Elixir Realm and she didn't know anything about the Purple Power World. She must have been born in some Lower World, and she was of the opinion that warriors of the Lower World were not very remarkable.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Mu Ning was just an Internal Elixir Realm warrior, which meant that the man she was longing for might not have a high-level cultivation base, probably at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. But if he was really so outstanding, he might, at most, be a Life and Death Realm warrior. And according to the woman in the purple robe, such a warrior was a mere nobody. The female warriors of the Lower World always had limited horizons and didn't know that there were far too many outstanding men in the universe.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not want to talk about this and was a little incensed with the woman in purple, but she asked suddenly, "Are you my master?"</p>

  <p>She had learned from the old man that as long as she entered the Purple Power World, a 'master' would naturally come looking for her. Since the woman in purple had appeared alone, Xi Youqin's mind had immediately jumped to the thought that perhaps this woman was her master.</p>

  <p>The woman in purple was taken aback at Xi Youqin's words.</p>

  <p>She was at the Spirit Supreme Realm, which meant that she was definitely competent enough to be the master of an Internal Elixir Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>The woman in the purple robe had already figured out that Mu Ning was not an ordinary warrior. If she really took Mu Ning as her disciple, her own master would probably chase her out of the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>But if she informed her master about Mu Ning, her master would probably be overjoyed.</p>

  <p>This thought brought the bitter taste of jealousy to the woman's heart.</p>

  <p>But she rearranged her features and a courteous smile surfaced on her face as she said, "You want to find a master here?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning replied, "Yes." She wanted to cultivate but she really didn't know how. She had learnt a few cultivation methods of the Ethereal Spirit Sect back at the Xi Clan, but they were incompatible with the Purple Power Body and couldn't be used at all.</p>

  <p>She would be more than willing to cultivate if she had a master. The thought that she would be able to help Luo Luo Zheng in the future and even give him a big surprise brought her a sense of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>The woman in purple smiled. "You're qualified to have a good master.</p>

  <p>Just wait a moment. Your master will be here very soon."</p>

  <p>The woman in purple believed that recommending Mu Ning to her own master would be a great deed, a chance that she would grab with both hands.</p>

  <p>But she was not the only warrior present in the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had suddenly pulled out millions of gigantic swords, which would probably also shock other warriors in the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>The woman in purple intended to introduce Mu Ning to her master before anyone else got a chance to meet Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>So the woman in purple quickly took out a message rune and burned it.</p>

  <p>The rune she was using was naturally much stronger than the ones from the Lower World. It could even send voice messages across this supreme world.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning took the woman at her word when she said that the master would be arriving soon. Mu Ning was pretty weak in aspects other than her EQ. Or rather, she couldn't be bothered to think too much about other things. So she picked up the Ancestral Dragon and continued to control the millions of giant swords. This time, the words she spelled out in the air were: "Staying in the pale moonlight, I miss you very much."</p>

  <p>As she waited for her master to arrive, the woman in purple looked at the words in the air. The melancholic words rendered her speechless, but also surprised her and made her a little curious as to why Mu Ning missed a man so much.</p>

  <p>She then spoke, "My master is a supreme expert of the Purple Power World. If you are lucky enough to become her disciple, you have to cultivate wholeheartedly. As for the man you love, don't even think about him anymore."</p>

  <p>To the woman's surprise, Mu Ning suddenly turned and blinked, a smile gracing her face. "If you don't allow me to think of him, I'd rather not cultivate."</p>

  <p>The woman in purple frowned, and then said, "If you become my master's disciple, I will be your senior. You should remember what I tell you today. My master is an outstanding warrior, and there are very few warriors in the universe who are qualified enough to become her disciples. You have to seize this opportunity, and once you grow stronger, you have the chance to select any young and excellent man you like! But right now, you should focus on your cultivation instead of thinking of the man you like."</p>

  <p>"I choose to cultivate just because of him," Mu Ning said. "If you're telling me not to think about him, then I will not cultivate. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" The woman in purple was stunned at Xi Youqin's words, wondering about the logic behind them. How could she cultivate just for a man? She thought about it for a few seconds and said, "Cultivating martial arts will strengthen your mind so you can break through your mental barrier and reach the top level of cultivation. You should cultivate for your own sake? think about yourself. How can you cultivate for someone else?"</p>

  <p>"But what's so inappropriate about my wanting to cultivate for someone else?" Mu Ning asked, tilting her head.</p>

  <p>The woman in purple was now in shock. She thought she should let her master persuade and teach Mu Ning. There was no need for her to meddle in this matter. In her eyes, it was hard to communicate with a woman like Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Minutes later, beams of purple light gathered and someone slowly appeared on the large ship.</p>

  <p>The woman in purple turned to watch, respect replacing the shock on her features. She knelt to the ground and greeted, "Master!"</p>

  <p>The person on the ship was dressed in a light purple robe. She was a beautiful woman, seemingly about forty years of age. The moment she had appeared, her eyes found Mu Ning and then shifted to the giant swords floating in the air.</p>

  <p>She had just learned from her disciple about the woman with a high-rank Purple Power body that her disciple had discovered. Her body might be at least a third-rank blue-purple body. At this news, she had hurriedly rushed over from the Purple Jade Building.</p>

  <p>The number of the Purple Power Bodies in the universe was huge. But most of them were light purple or cyan-purple. The light purple body and the cyan-purple body were at the sixth rank and the fifth rank respectively. The number of fourth-rank Purple Power body was extremely small. And if a woman had a fourth-rank Purple Power body, she had the qualifications to unconditionally join the Purple Jade Building.</p>

  <p>So when her disciple had told her that there was a woman with the blue-purple body, she was eager to meet her. She believed that Mu Ning might have the third-rank Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>But she was left shocked when she saw Mu Ning. It wasn't a third-rank or a second-rank Purple Power Body that Mu Ning had. It was much higher! She had the first-rank black-purple body. How had a first-rank Purple Power Body appeared? It was next to impossible! The beautiful woman was momentarily confused.</p>

  <p>"Master..." the woman in purple uttered softly, kneeling before her master.</p>

  <p>Realizing that she had lost her composure, the beautiful woman said to the woman in purple, "Bridget, please stand up."</p>

  <p>She then walked over to Mu Ning as Bridget went up to take the beautiful woman's arm. As they came to stop before Mu Ning, she asked her, "What is your name?"</p>

  <p>Realizing that the beautiful woman was her master, Mu Ning bowed and replied, "My surname is Xi, and my first name is Mu Ning."</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning Xi?" the beautiful woman asked.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded.</p>

  <p>The beautiful woman then said, "I'm the leader of the Purple Jade Building. If you take me as your master, then you'll have to join the Purple Jade Building."</p>
