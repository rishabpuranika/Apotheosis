<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before Tyler could even draw out his saber, Zheng had already passed the Wights. He raised his sword and rushed into the shadows.</p>

  <p>When Zheng charged in at first, he had attracted a large group of Wights.</p>

  <p>The fragrance of medicine emitted by Tyler and the others scared those creatures, so they never followed them.</p>

  <p>That very moment Zheng came through, a beam of blade light slashed towards him.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Zheng realized something and placed his long sword horizontally right in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The collision of the sword and the saber sent Zheng a few steps backward.</p>

  <p>When his eyes had already adapted to the darkness, he finally saw the person before him clearly.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows and smiled. "Tyler? So, we meet again."</p>

  <p>Indeed, Zheng had faced that man before.</p>

  <p>When the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race fought against each other, that exile controlled David as he battled against Zheng. Later, he was forced out of the void by that arrow shot by No. 9527. At that particular time, he was in a helpless state.</p>

  <p>Back then, there was a huge gap between Zheng and Tyler in terms of strength, which was very difficult to narrow out. After all, Tyler had already reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Tyler nonchalantly stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, he could easily kill Zheng with just a wave of his hand. Now that everyone became equal due to the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, Zheng had become Tyler's strong opponent, which displeased him a great deal.</p>

  <p>With an untamed smile, he told Zheng, "You're only a True God. How dare you assume that you're my match?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately swung his saber towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang!"</p>

  <p>Along with those three crisp sounds, Zheng himself had retreated three steps backward.</p>

  <p>Tyler's saber skill was very powerful. In the Source World, he successfully became an outstanding warrior from an ordinary man by doing it step by step. He went through a lot of fatal battles and had survived countless dangers.</p>

  <p>When he became an Other Shore Realm warrior, Tyler managed to restrain his behavior for many years while imprisoned in that world, seldom taking action.</p>

  <p>The current situation had awakened his ferocity. When he wielded and flourished his saber, he only meant to attack violently and did not just defend himself.</p>

  <p>Although there were many flaws in his body, Zheng didn't have time to attack them as he had to dodge the saber first.</p>

  <p>If he prioritized attacking Tyler first, he could be split in half.</p>

  <p>"This saber skill..."</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned. He could only temporarily avoid Tyler's attacks.</p>

  <p>With each and every strike, Tyler became more aggressive. He didn't plan on giving Zheng a break.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang!"</p>

  <p>Tyler put more force in every fatal attack he made.</p>

  <p>Zheng's steps were steady, and his long sword acted as a shield that blocked Tyler's every pounce.</p>

  <p>He rushed in to prevent those people from secretly releasing arrows. As long as Emily, Timotheus, and the others killed the Wights, they could come and help him.</p>

  <p>As long as Zheng held on, his goal could be achieved.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect Tyler to have such a quick temper and was just charging towards him nonstop.</p>

  <p>"You... go to hell!"</p>

  <p>With gritted teeth, Tyler pulled Zheng's sword away and marched towards him.</p>

  <p>That move put him in danger. In that case, Zheng could easily chop him in half using his sword. But if Zheng chose to do such a thing, he could potentially be smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng's body was not made out of steel.</p>

  <p>When he realized that Tyler's saber was about to hit him, Zheng's eyes flashed. He suddenly moved at a rapid speed. To avoid the attack, he almost pressed himself against the blade. As a result, his clothes were ripped apart.</p>

  <p>As he tried to dodge the attack, Zheng raised his arm and pointed his elbow unto Tyler's face.</p>

  <p>Tyler's attack was savage, but his face had actually crashed against Zheng's elbow.</p>

  <p>With a loud crack, Tyler's nose broke, blood gushing out of it and his mouth. The pain made him curl up into a ball.</p>

  <p>With an ordinary expression plastered on his face, Zheng took his chance and gently swung his long sword to stab Tyler.</p>

  <p>However, three exiles also charged towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>They weren't able to keep up with both Zheng and Tyler at first, but now that Tyler had stopped, they found their chance to meddle in.</p>

  <p>"Ding! Ding!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's long sword bent and swept across in a rather relaxed manner. The sword tip pointed somewhere else with precision while he struggled to use it to dodge the attacks.</p>

  <p>Then, the three exiles' weapons were blocked and pushed away by Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>That shocked the three exiles. They didn't expect that Zheng had such skillful swordsmanship. They grew very afraid.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they had no choice but to save Tyler, who was their mainstay.</p>

  <p>Right after the three of them were taken aback, they prepared for another attack. That time, Zheng's eyes went dark. If he was going to kill Tyler, then he needed to kill those three first.</p>

  <p>As that thought entered his mind, the long sword in his hand began to move faster. Facing the exile who used an axe on him, he gently lifted his sword and slashed it towards him, right along the axe helve.</p>

  <p>Realizing that his hands were about to be cut off by the sword, the exile became so terrified that he threw his weapon away. Zheng took his chance and pointed the sword tip at the man's face.</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing the scene, the other two exiles tried their best to stop Zheng's strike to save their companion.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng then withdrew his sword. It was just a fake attack. Instead, he went for the exile who held a dagger.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The long sword flashed with a short sword light, which swept past the exile's throat and cut off his entire neck. Thick blood flowed out of the wound.</p>

  <p>"What a cunning boy!"</p>

  <p>The two other exiles, holding the axe and the sword, had a distressed look on their faces. It seemed as if they were grieving.</p>

  <p>Although the three of them came from different races, they took care of one another in that world and had become close friends. They had a wonderful relationship over the years and treated each other like blood brothers.</p>

  <p>Now that one of them was badly hurt, they grew very angry.</p>

  <p>If only the exile's cultivation base was still high like before, such an injury was nothing. However, their bodies weren't stronger than that of mortals now, so that wound was enough to kill him.</p>

  <p>"Aaaargh!"</p>

  <p>The remaining two exiles let out a roar and immediately pounded towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Tyler, who had recovered, wiped the blood off his face and also rushed towards Zheng with his saber clutched tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>The three exiles put their lives at risk fighting a True God.</p>

  <p>Facing three bold guys, Zheng felt more pressure. If he kept retreating, he would be in so much danger.</p>

  <p>Then, they heard the sound of footsteps not far away.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been facing the four men by himself for such a long time. After a while, Timotheus managed to lead a group of people to head towards Zheng.</p>
