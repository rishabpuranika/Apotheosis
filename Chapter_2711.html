<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2711 The Lethal Fire Magma </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The four-legged Earth Ghosts had terribly bitten Cameron.</p>

  <p>Half of his chest, neck, and arm were all gnawed off.</p>

  <p>When it all happened, he thought he was doomed.</p>

  <p>He also thought that Luo Zheng had intended to kill him when he saw his palm coming for him. After all, he had been rude to him before.</p>

  <p>It was beyond his expectations that Luo Zheng could shake off the four-legged Earth Ghosts in just one forceful swing of his hand.</p>

  <p>"You? You?" Cameron stared at Luo Zheng for a while.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was rushing forward, he waved his right hand and threw a light green pill right into Cameron's mouth.</p>

  <p>As soon as the pill melted in his mouth, the deep wounds on his body healed quickly. His skin and flesh regenerated.</p>

  <p>He was quite grateful to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that some seemingly wicked stranger would save him from potential death.</p>

  <p>As he looked at Leland and the other True Gods running in front of him, a sense of disgust suddenly emerged in his heart.</p>

  <p>Upon discovering the abnormal phenomenon in this place, he immediately reported it to Leland.</p>

  <p>Leland had promised him a reward if he could find something valuable inside the cave. When he was in deep trouble, however, his companions did nothing to save him.</p>

  <p>"Hiss?"</p>

  <p>The four-legged Earth Ghosts moved at an unusual speed on the cave walls. Even if Luo Zheng flew through the cave, he was unable to get rid of them.</p>

  <p>"Look! There are a lot of Earth Ghosts behind!"</p>

  <p>Cameron told Luo Zheng with a terrified face as he heard more hisses from hundreds of black Earth Ghosts that were pouncing on them from behind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng no longer needed to hide himself. He could feel and see around him through his spiritual sense without even looking back.</p>

  <p>"The Gods Killing Sword Array!"</p>

  <p>Four invisible force fluctuations spread out, which immediately turned into four invisible swords that hovered around rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Power Shaping? Are you a consummate True God who mainly cultivates the Might Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>Cameron's eyes were wide in shock upon noticing the strong force fluctuations. He had been in the Evil Ghost Region all year round and was well-informed, but Power Shaping was very rare. He had heard of it but had never actually seen it.</p>

  <p>The Earth Ghosts that were chasing them were easily swayed away by the swords.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>The four-legged Earth Ghosts boasted infinite power and thick skins, so it was difficult even for consummate True Gods to kill them, but not for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With loud shrieks, the four-legged Earth Ghosts smashed onto the cave walls formed by soft stones. Immediately, the soft stones swallowed their black bodies.</p>

  <p>One of those creatures' talents was that they could easily walk through the layer of soft stones.</p>

  <p>In no time, a large group of four-legged Earth Ghosts appeared right above Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!"</p>

  <p>They began to climb on top of each other and formed a huge net using their own bodies.</p>

  <p>"They're going to block our way!" Cameron said in horror.</p>

  <p>"These monsters are smart," Luo Zheng muttered as his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Thunder Materialization!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A pair of huge thunder wings popped out of Luo Zheng's back. His speed had swiftly doubled.</p>

  <p>Cameron felt as if he was flying high above the sky. Before the huge net created by those creatures even closed in on them, Luo Zheng had already sped away with him.</p>

  <p>"Is this the consummate level token of the Thunderstorm Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>Cameron was baffled. He thought to himself, 'I was wrong. This guy mainly cultivates the Thunderstorm Divine Dao, doesn't he?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sped up and approached the team ahead.</p>

  <p>Leland took the lead.</p>

  <p>As long as the four-legged Earth Ghosts stood in his way, he waved his hands and easily swept the black monsters using five-colored internal momentum.</p>

  <p>"We can't keep on descending!" Jelan, who followed closely behind Leland, said with a worried face.</p>

  <p>An anxious consummate True God also said, "If we stop, they will tear us into pieces. What should we do?"</p>

  <p>"No matter how deep this cave is, there will be an end. I'm not going to die here today," Leland stated flatly.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they heard a thunderous explosion behind them.</p>

  <p>Their spiritual senses charged back and they were all surprised to see the pair of thunder wings that Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>"That guy actually saved Cameron?"</p>

  <p>"Just leave him alone."</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Zheng had caught up with them, many more four-legged Earth Ghosts appeared from both sides of the cave.</p>

  <p>The creatures didn't go after them and just glared at them from a distance with their round eyes.</p>

  <p>It was a little strange.</p>

  <p>Leland was slightly fixated at that scene. Then, on the corner of his eyes, he saw holes the size of a fist appear on the wall of the cave. Inside those holes were rays of dark green light being released.</p>

  <p>He had doubts in his mind, but as he realized what was happening, his expression changed. "Everyone, be careful! Stay away from those holes!" Leland cried out.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, green magma suddenly gushed out from the holes where the four-legged Earth Ghosts came out of.</p>

  <p>"It's Lethal Fire Magma!"</p>

  <p>Failing to defeat them, the four-legged Earth Ghosts drilled holes through the layer of soft stones so they could draw out the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>The magma underground was worse than the water in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>They could turn even the Holy Beings into ashes. How could they get past it?</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Three top-rank True Gods who were unable to dodge were immediately cut through by a stream of Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma resembled sharp arrows and left fist-sized holes on their chests.</p>

  <p>Such injuries were not fatal to the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>But around the holes on their chests, there was still some Lethal Fire Magma left.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other with horror in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Help! Help! Who can help me?" one of the True Gods frantically wailed.</p>

  <p>"Pull the Lethal Fire Magma out of your body!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>But no one dared to help them.</p>

  <p>The presence of the Lethal Fire Magma could undoubtedly cause death.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The small bit of Lethal Fire Magma that remained on their bodies instantly ignited, turning into balls of green flames that quickly enveloped the three top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>In just a split second, they all vanished.</p>

  <p>Their bodies, souls and inner worlds had been burnt to nothingness, turning into green streams of Lethal Fire Magma, and flowing into the gaps between the soft stones on the ground. .</p>

  <p>If there was anything in the world that could resist the power of the Lethal Fire Magma, it must be the layer of soft stones.</p>
