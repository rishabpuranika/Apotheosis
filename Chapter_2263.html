  <p>In the past few years, the rankings of the Floating Islands happened to be very stable and organized. Because of this, all the powerful clans already knew who was in the lead, and who was falling behind. It was rare for them to guess it wrong.</p>

  <p>For example, the Han Clan was in danger of falling out of the top 10.</p>

  <p id="top_21">This led them to become allies with the Leng Clan, so they could both boost up their rankings.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's presence made the battle unpredictable. As he continued to win, it directly affected the clan rankings, so there was a need to monitor him throughout the process.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng returned to his room, the door to his room flashed with blue light and began to float upward. His ranking had been increased more than thirty places.</p>

  <p>"So fast!"</p>

  <p>"Plus, considering the time he spent in finding his opponent when he went back to his room, it only took him less than a minute to find and defeat his opponent, another low-rank True God!"</p>

  <p>"He has already had five victories in a row! This is truly something to worry about. Which clan did they say he was from?"</p>

  <p>The doors in the Hall of True Gods continued to shift from rays of light up and down. This wasn't a surprise to anyone, but none of them were attracted to any of the doors aside from Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Around five minutes after Luo Luo Zheng won his fifth round, the door began to move upwards once again.</p>

  <p>Just like that, he was at his sixth consecutive win!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng easily dominated his matches. What made him feel the most accomplished was being able to smoothly absorb the Internal Momentum of two new Divine Dao throughout these matches. Moreover, the extra reward points doubled, so he gained more than one thousand and two hundred points which shocked himself.</p>

  <p>However, according to what Joy had told him, Luo Luo Zheng didn't use the Gods Killing Sword Array at all.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Holy Beings of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, the Gods Killing Sword Array was equivalent to Joy. As a Demi-holy Being, she was able to fight against with a Holy Being with the assistance of this particular array. Many of them did not pay enough attention to the Cross-world token. Joy, on the other hand, was able to use the Power Shaping and the Cross-world token to their maximum potential.</p>

  <p>The only difference between Joy and the Holy Beings was that her Purple Sky Land did not guarantee her immortality. The Holy Beings, however, for as long as the universes they created were immortal, they would be immortal.</p>

  <p>In the end, she wished for Luo Luo Zheng to be a variable of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng earned a great deal of points and gave them to the Purple Soul Hall when it was necessary, he might as well be the key to increasing the rank of Han Clan's Floating Island. But if he executed the Gods Killing Sword Array earlier than he should, wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, such as the Qin Clan and Tang Clan, would know the anonymous man was from the Han Clan and suppress their points.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had to play smart in his battles, using only his own strength and soul to deal with his opponents.</p>

  <p>Two hours had passed and Luo Luo Zheng had just bagged seven consecutive wins, while the extra points in one single round had increased to one thousand points.</p>

  <p>Two hours turned into four, and at this point, Luo Luo Zheng had won nine consecutive wins. The extra points for one round had increased to two thousand and six hundred points, and it looked like nothing was going to stop him.</p>

  <p>Four hours turned into a quick six hours, and Luo Luo Zheng was standing with ten consecutive victories. The extra points amounted to four thousand seven hundred.</p>

  <p>His door's ranking was also getting higher and higher around the Hall of True Gods, and it was almost so high that people couldn't even see it anymore.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the noises in the Hall of True Gods began to fade into softened tones. When they saw this scene, many of the warriors began to retreat to their clans in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Can you believe it? The anonymous man has accumulated ten consecutive wins already!"</p>

  <p>"If he wins one more, he'll obtain eight thousand and three hundred points!"</p>

  <p>"He definitely has potential to beat warriors with higher cultivation levels than him, and he has never lost one battle. Does anyone know what clan he is from?"</p>

  <p>"This is a crisis. If that guy is from the Zhou Clan, our Bai Clan would be suppressed!"</p>

  <p>"But okay, this is also an opportunity, people! Imagine it? if we defeat the anonymous man, we can gain his points, too! Just where is he from?"</p>

  <p>"He's been a mystery throughout all the battles. He has never been defeated when he was fighting against proving godly warriors; even his ranking has not appeared once. Why is it so impossible to determine his identity?!"</p>

  <p>"I want to challenge this man!"</p>

  <p>Every time a person who took part in a battle that was beyond their cultivation level appeared, the True Gods in the Arena of Legends would fuss like never before. It left people enraged, giddy, and perplexed all at the same time.</p>

  <p>Historically, powerful clans hated people who challenged warriors with higher cultivation levels because it broke the balance among the clans.</p>

  <p>What made it worse was that no one knew who he was, which made them very suspicious and frankly, mistrusting.</p>

  <p>However, this was also a huge opportunity. Everyone looked forward to garnering his points and some low-rank True Gods, who were highly confident in their strengths, were now eager to get a fight out of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>To their disappointment, Luo Luo Zheng had no plans to leave his room. He was still going to choose his opponents at random, so everyone waiting just had to bank on their luck in order to fight him.</p>
