  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stayed in the void for a long time.</p>

  <p>Several streams of different powerful consciousness successively launched attacks against the will of the great worlds, but Luo Zheng blocked and annihilated all of them in one go.</p>

  <p>There were a staggering total of forty-five attacks that were aimed at the will of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>Some of the streams of consciousness evidently came from the same person. Afraid to be killed by Luo Zheng, they focused all their effort and attacked at rapid successions to gain a solid foothold within the will of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>However, their efforts were in vain.</p>

  <p>There were one million and thirty three great worlds' wills that fused together, which worked to Zheng's advantage and had been taken for his own uses. Who knew just how powerful this new fused will was?</p>

  <p>Even if those streams of consciousness were as strong and mighty as Supreme Lords, just a mere thought from Luo Zheng was enough to crush all of them like pesky ants under his boots. They stood no chance against his prowess.</p>

  <p>The destruction of the consciousness had caused great damages to the souls that had sent out the consciousness. After Luo Zheng killed the streams of consciousness over and over, the souls that were initially unwilling to give up finally saw how futile their attempts had been and stopped. It didn't take long before the great world fell into silence.</p>

  <p>"Those guys must have come from the sorcerer race," Luo Zheng analyzed with deep calmness.</p>

  <p>With undivided attention, he tried to search through the memories of the great world's will to pin down the location of the creatures that launched the attacks, but the memories that came out were completely blank and gave him no substantial information. These people were definitely not aboriginals of the great worlds, and they could not be Master Feng or the other Supreme Lords with him either. The only one whom he suspected that was most likely to have done it was the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>After the attacks ceased, Luo Zheng continued to move forward in the void. He traveled all the way without rest until he reached the location of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. The area behind it, he noted, was completely bare and empty.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng originally thought this was the lair of the sorcerer race, but now, he found that there were no living creatures existing here. Could it be that they had already been cleared by Master Feng and the others?</p>

  <p>Of course, he did not know that in order to spread the fake will, all the sorcerer race members had already sacrificed themselves. Even the tower that originally existed there had been burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>Oblivious to that information, Luo Zheng opened a crack and entered the space on the front side of this world.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that what awaited outside the crack was a calm and peaceful scenery.</p>

  <p>"This... Is this still the Chaotic Ocean of Stars?" Luo Zheng asked, stunned and completely at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>The storm that had been ravaging in the skies above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars for countless years had vanished into thin air, as if it had never been there.</p>

  <p>A gentle wave slowly lapped at Zheng's feet. The sea, which was once angry and relentless, seemed to have calmed down.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already guessed that the great worlds' wills had relied on storms to spread. Now that all of the wills of the great worlds had fused and merged into one, the storms' mission was finally over.</p>

  <p>Although Master Feng and the others were nowhere to be found and Luo Zheng couldn't find them through the will of the great worlds, he assumed that the Supreme Lords had the situation under control, considering how peaceful the great world was so far.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Zheng's shoulders sagged in relief and he let out a long breath. The reason why he didn't want to leave with the other Godly Geniuses was because he was afraid that the entire Central Region would be destroyed. If the Supreme Lords were able to suppress the sorcerer race, then Luo Zheng could finally rest his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng circled around the sea and saw a few ferocious beasts coming out from the depths of the ocean floor now that the storm had stopped. Like him, they seemed to be confused why the Chaotic Ocean of Stars suddenly turned calm.</p>

  <p>Some of the beasts discovered Luo Zheng, but after they took a glimpse of him and noticed his cultivation level, they returned to the sea without further incident. Zheng's Mu Ning was a clear message that he was not someone they could trifle with.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Zheng returned to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Due to what had happened before, all of the people in the Central Region were in a state of panic, and when Luo Zheng killed the consciousness of the powerful warriors of the sorcerer race, he had released strong waves of killing intent, which made the people in the Central Region panic even more. Everyone was paralyzed with fear, as if the apocalypse was about to knock on their doors.</p>

  <p>The people of the great world didn't know what the heavens were really like. They created their own legends and understanding of them based on their own cultures; however, the invisible killing intent he spread had caused a large portion of them to sink into fear and assume the worst.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall was remarkably empty, too. The huge Cloudy City, which was once buzzing with life, felt like an abandoned ghost city now.</p>

  <p>Even the martial artists, in fear of what was to come had run for their own lives, and the ordinary people had more reasons to do so as they brought their families out to flee. The sense of crisis had spread from top to bottom, quickly reaching everyone and inciting mass panic, which drove the people to pack up and leave.</p>

  <p>Only after returning to the Cloud Hall did Luo Zheng activate the token of mountain and release all those who had been hiding in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Cloud Hall was not damaged, Ning Yudie and the rest also let out a sigh of relief. In the end, it was just a false alarm.</p>

  <p>If the Supreme Lords had really fought here, even a hundred Central Regions would not be enough for them to destroy.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng himself didn't know that it was because he had fused with the great worlds' will that he managed to stop the Torch Dragon from fusing with the great worlds' will; otherwise, it would be hard to say how everything could have ended.</p>

  <p>After all, if the Torch Dragon had fused with the will of the great worlds, it would inevitably fight the Supreme Lords regardless of whether it could defeat them or not. Since the Torch Dragon knew how to fuse with the will of the great worlds, it definitely knew how to transfer the strength. In fact, it might even have a much richer knowledge of how to use the will of the great worlds than Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>If the Torch Dragon took the Supreme Lords' attacks and transferred the power to this great world, then it wouldn't have taken long before this great world faced its doom.</p>

  <p>Soon, Ning Yudie summoned back all the disciples that had been dismissed and reorganized the Cloud Hall with careful, thorough plans.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Supreme Lord Mirage reappeared in the Cloud Hall and informed Luo Zheng that Master Feng and the other Supreme Lords had returned to the supreme worlds. In the same breath, he also informed him of the situation in the universe.</p>

  <p>Currently, the entire universe went up in arms and made several actions to wipe out the sorcerer race. Under the leadership of Supreme Lord of Original Sin, they went from one supreme world to another, to hunt down the supreme sorcerers, which caused the sorcerer race to nearly disintegrate.</p>

  <p>The trouble brought about by the sorcerer race had caused terrible chaos in the universe, but with the help of many Supreme Lords, it was diminished and suppressed.</p>

  <p>"Actually, what's more important is the battle with the Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>These fellows wanted to steal the heavens, but something seems to have happened. As we speak, Master Feng is still tracking down the person who fused with the worlds' will," Supreme Lord Mirage informed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing it, Luo Zheng schooled his expression to keep his face straight, but his chest burst with a strange, unfathomable feeling.</p>

  <p>Wasn't he the one who had fused with the worlds' will?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage couldn't read what Luo Zheng had on his mind. He was sent here on the orders of Master Feng to tell Luo Zheng to come back to the Celestial Position in time and enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race was not the biggest threat from the start. The most powerful threat came from the other side of the Sighing Wall, and the Sighing Wall could be broken down any moment. So the Godly Geniuses must improve their cultivation as soon as possible to prepare for the worst.</p>

  <p>A few days later, all the disciples had come back to the Cloud Hall upon Yudie's summons. Once they were all gathered, she announced her intent and passed the position of leadership to Morphens.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, Luo Zheng took Geoffrey and his wives to the fairy palace, and then he activated the Teleportation Token again. He was more than ready to return to the supreme world where the Celestial Position was.</p>

  <p>Although the Teleportation Token was extremely convenient and could allow Luo Zheng to travel freely, there was a problem at hand. It was difficult for him to pinpoint the exact location, whether it was in the supreme world he wanted to go or in the great world.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it wasn't that difficult to move in the great world through flying because the great world wasn't very large to begin with. And with Zheng's current speed, it wouldn't take him too much time to cross it. But it was a different case with the supreme world. No matter where he landed in the supreme world, it would still be very far from his destination.</p>

  <p>This time, he encountered the same problem. Luo Zheng had been sent to the edge of the supreme world, which frustrated him to no end.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't find the ascending passageway right away, even if he traveled at the maximum speed, it would still take him at least half a year to reach his destination.</p>

  <p>Helpless and left with no other choice, Luo Zheng could only resort to the Roaring Token to call for help.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng finally returned to the Celestial Position, the ten Godly Geniuses were finally reunited. Luo Zheng noticed that Nathan's originally blind eyes had now recovered.</p>

  <p>One other thing that changed was Nathan's behavior toward him. His strong hostility toward Luo Zheng was gone, probably because he had saved Nathan before. Luo Zheng smiled, pleased at the turn of events.</p>
