<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 638 The Wonders Of Cloudy City (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Top powerful clans were also present in the Burning Sky Capital, such as the top seven noble clans and the royal family. Cloud Sect was located there too, which was a grade two sect. Aura's royal family could only be regarded as a grade two force too, while the top seven noble clans had no rank.</p>

  <p>The Cloudy City, on the other hand, had eight grade three sects. This did not include the Cloud School as it was affiliated to Cloud Hall and they shared the same system.</p>

  <p>On way to Cloudy City, practitioners at the Illuminating Soul Realm could be seen everywhere. And if one was lucky, he could even see some Internal Elixir Realm practitioners. They walked in the streets in small groups. Their only purpose in coming to Cloudy City was to buy some supplements.</p>

  <p>On the streets of Cloudy City, no one paid attention to Luo Zheng. Though he was known in many other locations, in here, he was nobody. It was quite a relief for Luo Zheng because he didn't like much attention. This would make his journey a more pleasant one.</p>

  <p>He followed the instruction that Lasseter gave and immediately found the location of the branch alliance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also had done some research about the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>He found out that although this alliance didn't rank in the power list, the power behind it was striking. It was even a little higher than Cloud Hall and at par with Ethereal Spirit Sect, the most powerful sect in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Given its striking power, Luo Zheng was expecting to see a grand location of the branch. For the first time, he was concerned that he wasn't dressed enough to enter its office. However, when he finally reached the location, he was stunned. The branch alliance kept a very low profile. It was located among the dwellings and if not for the two Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners guarding the gate, no one would think that this was a special place.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng approached, one of the Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners gestured to him and said coldly, "Stop! This is the branch of the World Commercial Alliance. This is no place for a child like you. Now, turn around and be on your way!"</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance owned many shops in the Central Region, so generally, its branch wasn't involved in retail businesses. The practitioners would usually come here only for important issues or block trading. And these practitioners should have reached at least the pinnacle of the Illuminating Soul Realm, Internal Elixir Realm, or any level higher.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Luo Zheng, the two Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners immediately recognized that Luo Zheng was just a nature creature. Given his level, he was not qualified to enter the gate. Thus, the two Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners insisted on driving Luo Zheng away. "Hey, buddy!</p>

  <p>You better leave soon. Don't waste our time. Our patience is short!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't like the attitude that the two Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners showed him. He frowned and thought, 'The World Commercial Alliance seems to think highly of itself! If I didn't need something from them, I wouldn't have come here!' Then he took out an invitation letter from his pocket and tossed it to them. He said, "This is the invitation letter the World Commercial Alliance gave to me!"</p>

  <p>One of the Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners picked up the invitation letter. He thought that it was a bluff that Luo Zheng was trying to play. He was smirking as he opened the letter. But when he read the name of Lasseter, his attitude immediately changed and the smirk on his face was wiped away instantly.</p>

  <p>Lasseter was an ordinary steward at the headquarters of the alliance, but he was the top at the branch. He had that reputation at the branch, and everyone knew who Lasseter was. So, it was just customary that these two practitioners guarding the gate became curious as to why Lasseter would have given an invitation letter to a nature creature.</p>

  <p>Despite being Illuminating Soul Realm masters, they could only become the doormen of the branch alliance. That meant that even at their level, they still didn't deserve a high-ranking position. So, it was a bit odd for a mere nature creature to be greeted and welcomed by the alliance. 'Is he related to Lasseter? Does he come here for a job?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>While they were in a dilemma, a burst of loud laughter roared from behind them. When they turned to see, an old man appeared from the gate and walked towards Luo Zheng with a smile. He greeted Luo Zheng politely, "You must be Luo Zheng! Welcome, my little friend! I apologize for being late. I hope you can forgive me!"</p>

  <p>Their jaws dropped open in shock. They immediately bowed before the old man as a sign of respect. They could feel their breath becoming heavy and their hearts pumping harder. It was no other than the leader of the branch alliance named Michael Mo.</p>

  <p>'What's going on? Is this guy some bigwig? Why is Michael greeting him in person?' The two Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners were so stunned that sweat started to show on their face. They could feel the mighty presence of Michael.</p>

  <p>They almost believed that Luo Zheng was a big shot when they heard him say,</p>

  <p>"There must be a mistake. Could you please tell me who you are?"</p>

  <p>'He doesn't know Michael?! But why Michael is so polite to him? This young man..." Though they didn't like Zheng's straightforwardness towards Michael, they were worried that Luo Zheng would speak ill about them to Michael. Given the arrogance they had shown him earlier, it was highly possible. This could be the end for them.</p>

  <p>"My name is Michael Mo. Luo Zheng, may I invite you to come in? Let's discuss in detail over some tea," Michael said with a smile. The tone in Michael's voice felt like he was talking to his senior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng politely nodded. As he was about to follow Michael, he glanced at the two Illuminating Soul Realm practitioners indifferently. The two practitioners were relieved.</p>

  <p>The look on Zheng's face appeared to them as calm. If he wasn't that annoyed, they guessed that he wouldn't rat them out in front of Michael.</p>

  <p>As Michael's and Zheng's figures eventually faded from afar, they started to wonder as to who Luo Zheng really was.</p>
