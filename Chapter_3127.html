<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng's inner world trembled as the demonic eye fell.</p>

  <p>Almost all the creatures in the inner world raised their heads to look at the sky at the tremors.</p>

  <p>The power of the Godly Way was far greater than that of life vitality, and the Other Shore Power was far superior to that of the Godly Way. There were qualitative changes among the three kinds of powers.</p>

  <p>When he appeared before the red stone in the Dragon City for the first time, Zheng had gathered most of his strength, but the test told him that his force only reached one divine megaton.</p>

  <p>However, the Other Shore Power that the demonic eye contained reached dozens of divine megatons.</p>

  <p>The demonic eye's aura could shake the entire inner world.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The great pressure forced the water of the chaotic sea to rush in all directions.</p>

  <p>The seawater surged to the edges of the inner world, but the invisible walls formed by the Thousand Sanskrit Land blocked it, causing it to rebound towards the continents in the form of a tsunami that was ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>There were thousands of villages and cities on the continents.</p>

  <p>The people of these villages and cities were frightened as they spotted the tsunami in the distance.</p>

  <p>Powerful warriors and True Gods began to escape, while ordinary mortals didn't even have the chance to do so. Ordinary people were weak as ants in the face of natural disasters like this.</p>

  <p>The tsunami was about to make its way to every continent when Zheng's avatar raised an arm.</p>

  <p>He would not allow such a disaster to wreck his inner world.</p>

  <p>Air walls appeared from the coastlines of all the continents.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even though the tsunami was extremely powerful, it could not break through the air walls.</p>

  <p>"This must be a miracle!"</p>

  <p>"It is a miracle!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for protecting us!"</p>

  <p>"The Creator is helping us."</p>

  <p>The mortals knelt on the ground, heads bowed and hands clasped in worship.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the Faith Energy they were sending out to him, Zheng felt his internal momentum increase.</p>

  <p>In order to increase the Faith Energy of the creatures from their inner worlds, some True Gods would cause disasters on purpose and then save the creatures in their inner worlds. Only in this way could the creatures feel grateful and believe in their creators.</p>

  <p>Some powerful warriors and True Gods were staring solemnly at the sky.</p>

  <p>Their spiritual senses were extremely powerful. They sensed that an extremely powerful thing had come to this world, and the power contained within it was countless times stronger than that of the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>It was hard for them to imagine that there was such a powerful thing in this world.</p>

  <p>In a small pavilion on a mountain of the Flower Dancing Sect, a pretty woman was pouring a cup of tea for Geoffrey. She was the Holy Maiden of the Flower Dancing Sect. Her name was well-known in this continent and countless young men admired her.</p>

  <p>She handed the cup to Geoffrey, but he suddenly raised his head to look at the sky.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden also sensed the strong aura and panicked.</p>

  <p>If this force was brought down upon them, it would be powerful enough to destroy the whole continent.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden looked up at the sky and said, "I wonder what it is. It's so powerful!"</p>

  <p>"Let me take a look!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey knew that there was no one in the world, except his father, who could put such a powerful thing in his inner world.</p>

  <p>"But it's too dangerous. Please don't go!" the Holy Maiden cried out, trembling.</p>

  <p>Even though Geoffrey had defeated the three most powerful warriors of the Heavenly Annihilation Sect and ranked first in the continent, there was still a huge gap between his power and that of the thing descending upon this world.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I will be fine," said Geoffrey, his eyes softening as he took her delicate hand. He then used the Grand Teleportation and disappeared.</p>

  <p>He walked out of the space channel only to be confronted with the sight of a huge eyeball.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling rose in his heart.</p>

  <p>He thought of death and everything that would make him panic.</p>

  <p>And before he could react, Geoffrey's spirit had almost collapsed.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Zheng found his son in time. With a wave of his hand, he created a space to shroud Geoffrey's body so that it was utterly isolated from the outside world. He simultaneously cut off the power of the demonic eye.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey gasped for breath, still tensed.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, how could you be so reckless?"</p>

  <p>Zheng berated the young man.</p>

  <p>Quite a while passed before Geoffrey finally calmed down and was able to speak. "I thought it wouldn't be dangerous."</p>

  <p>Since everyone else was too frightened to approach the demonic eye, Zheng wasn't worried about hurting anyone.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't expected his son to appear here. How could Geoffrey stand the power of the demonic eye, given his current cultivation base?</p>

  <p>"Leave this place. I am going to carry the demonic eye now," Zheng said, waving his hand. He threw the space that enveloped Geoffrey's body onto the continent.</p>

  <p>It was not until he had chased Geoffrey away that Zheng began to focus on carrying the demonic eye.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>When the demonic eye descended to a certain height, the Sanskrit words on the edge of the inner world started to move.</p>

  <p>One Sanskrit word began to glow and then started to absorb the water of the chaotic sea. The water turned into a golden chain and extended towards the demonic eye.</p>

  <p>With a resounding clink, the huge chain wrapped around the demonic eye.</p>

  <p>The second Sanskrit word formed another chain and wrapped around the eye. Then the third. The fourth. The fifth... The tenth...</p>

  <p>There were finally one hundred and four Sanskrit words that formed one hundred and four golden chains that wrapped around the eye.</p>

  <p>"If an Other Shore Realm warrior with the Ten Sanskrit Land were to carry the demonic eye, their inner world would probably collapse," Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>A large portion of people in the Dragon City didn't have the Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>They entered the Other Shore Realm and got the Other Shore Tokens, but were unable to put them into their inner worlds. Because of this, it was difficult for them to exert the real power of the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>A small number of them, like Monica and Gant, had the Ten Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>They were stronger than ordinary Other Shore Realm warriors, and were qualified to become Flag Masters. They could, at the very least, give full play to the power of their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't yet known of anyone having the Hundred Sanskrit Land or the Thousand Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>The golden chains twined around the demonic eye, and then released gold light that illuminated the whole inner world so that it looked like it was daytime. Soon, all the chains disappeared, leaving the demonic eye floating in the air.</p>

  <p>The demonic eye, like a tamed beast, had been integrated with Zheng's inner world like the Nine Divine Stars. Even if it was extremely powerful, it wouldn't exert pressure on the inner world and was now under Zheng's complete control.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to study the demonic eye again.</p>

  <p>He looked surprised after a while of studying it. He then left his inner world and opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>This demonic eye was known as the Eye of Will. In the long history of the Dreaded Eye Demon race, there were a total of nineteen Eyes of Will. Two of them had been kept in the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>The theurgy to arouse people's fear was an innate theurgy of the Dreaded Eye Demon race, and any one of the Dreaded Eye Demons could use it.</p>

  <p>But the Eye of Will had another ability, which was the Authentic Visual World.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows shot up, a ray of white light shooting out of his right eye.</p>

  <p>An illusion of a huge cave sat in the practice room of the Sword Tower. The long swords, huge swords, and even the jade cushion beneath him didn't actually exist. But Zheng couldn't see through them with his current strength.</p>

  <p>However, the illusion had disappeared in the vision of Zheng's right eye. He was sitting in a bare room.</p>

  <p>"This ability is amazing!"</p>

  <p>He remembered that there was a manual called Sword Texture Technique in the Truth Library. He could combine the Authentic Visual World and the Sword Texture Technique.</p>
