  <p>
</p>

  <p>Two strange rays of light shot out of Livingston's iron head. They glowed with vigor.</p>

  <p>Even though his puppet body was simple and crude, it was still able to express his emotions. The radiance clearly indicated that he was excited.</p>

  <p>"How.. how is this possible?" he exclaimed with surprise.</p>

  <p>It was hard to believe that this large piece of Star Essence Iron, which was unimaginably heavy, had been picked up by Luo Luo Zheng so easily!</p>

  <p>It was something beyond Livingston's imagination.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng swung the sword embryo in a circle and smiled at Livingston. "Do you also want to give it a try?" He then handed the pincers to Livingston.</p>

  <p>Livingston took the pincers from him and discovered that as he held them, he did not feel their weight at all. "What a miracle!" he said. "This tool is extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>He had high expectations of the weapon refining workshop and knew that the items here were all special, but still, this miraculous tool exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>He examined the pincers closely but could not find anything special in them. Livingston failed to understand how the heavy iron became weightless by the tool.</p>

  <p>"This pair of pincers is made of the Infinity Stone, so theoretically, it should be able to lift anything, regardless of the weight it has," Saul explained in a flat tone.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Destiny of Infinity!" Livingston shouted out a strange term at Saul's explanation.</p>

  <p>Saul gave him a surprised glance and asked curiously, "What's that?"</p>

  <p>"It's the Heavenly Destiny of the last grand era. It was contained in the Crown of Destiny which was obtained by Supreme Lord of Infinity!"</p>

  <p>Livingston recalled.</p>

  <p>The so-called Heavenly Destiny of Infinity was also a Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>After the Supreme Lord of Infinity grasped such a Law of Causality, he could lift anything, including the sun, the moon, and the stars.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's impressive," Saul responded listlessly. He then turned to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, my master, you don't have to worry about the weight of the sword.</p>

  <p>There should still be some Infinity Stones in this workshop. After the Star Essence Iron is shaped into a sword, its hilt can be made out of the Infinity Stone. Then you can use the sword at will."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Judging from the materials alone, it would be nearly impossible for his opponents to destruct and damage this new sword of his.</p>

  <p>But how powerful it turned out to be would depend on Livingston's workmanship.</p>

  <p>"This is great!"</p>

  <p>Livingston was wild with joy. He held the pincers in his hand and toyed with the sword embryo skillfully.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>He was so happy that he threw the iron upward and loosened the grip of the pincers at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Freya screamed. His outrageous action scared the life out of her.</p>

  <p>Although the sword embryo was only four inches long, it weighed more than ten million mountains. If it were to fall on someone, they would be smashed into meat paste! What a careless puppet!</p>

  <p>However, the puppet in question, Livingston, was quite confident of his movements. He unhurriedly waited for the sword embryo to spin once in the air. Before it fell to the ground, he extended the pincers and caught it steadily. He had immersed himself in weapon refining for hundreds of millions of years. How was it possible for him to make stupid mistakes like that?</p>

  <p>After he put the sword embryo into the furnace, he turned to Saul and asked, "I can now handle the Star Essence Iron with these pincers, but how am I to forge it?"</p>

  <p>Obviously, ordinary hammers could not be used to forge this rare material.</p>

  <p>However, Livingston also knew that since the sword embryo was found in the workshop, there would be a suitable tool for it here as well.</p>

  <p>"Please follow me." Saul smiled and led them into the storeroom of the workshop.</p>

  <p>Aside from the various tools in the storeroom, there were countless rare materials, all arranged in a neat manner. It felt like a great treasure house.</p>

  <p>Livingston was dazzled by what he saw. He jumped with joy.</p>

  <p>This workshop was like paradise to him. Both him and Luo Luo Zheng were lucky to be able to utilize this place.</p>

  <p>However, it would still take him some time to make full use of this weapon refining workshop. The day he would forge the sword embryo was yet to be on his agenda, but ever since he had entered the workshop, he could not move a step away from it.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he once again immersed himself in the library.</p>

  <p>Gus' embodiment of Dark and Light energies had been defeated by him.</p>

  <p>He had later recommended three martial arts books to him.</p>

  <p>They were Enemy Repelling Arts, Thunderbolt Annihilation and Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>There were countless martial arts books in the library, but since Gus specifically recommended these three books to him, Luo Luo Zheng decided to find them and read through them in detail. Whether or not he practiced them would depend on their suitability to him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a number of world lords guarded the Immortal Mansion outside.</p>

  <p>After the Supreme Lords left, several large races had sent out some of their world lords to spy on the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>These world lords maintained a certain distance from the palace. After all, even the Supreme Lords were unable to escape the Desperate Melee.</p>

  <p>If these world lords were caught in it, it would not be a good end for them.</p>

  <p>With them around, Luo Luo Zheng had no other choice but to hide in his Immortal Mansion and continue his cultivation.</p>

  <p>So it was that one month passed.</p>

  <p>Then the second month.</p>

  <p>And then the third.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion still continued to float through the deep space.</p>

  <p>The universe had restored its peace.</p>

  <p>During this time, many Supreme Lords chose to stay indoors.</p>

  <p>Although they could not snatch the Crown of Destiny from Luo Zheng's hands, they knew that four new Crowns of Destiny would appear now that four Supreme Lords had fallen.</p>

  <p>Obtaining a Crown of Destiny meant the advent of a new Supreme Lord in their race. All races in the universe were ready to fight for the Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Soon, the sixth month arrived.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords felt the heavens shake.</p>

  <p>The first Crown of Destiny had appeared.</p>

  <p>In the seventh month, the heavens shook again.</p>

  <p>The second Crown of Destiny had manifested.</p>

  <p>In the eighth and the ninth months, the other two Crowns of Destiny arrived.</p>

  <p>For these four Crowns of Destiny, the Demon Night race, the ogres, the human race, and many other races fought four intense battles, expending their formidable strength.</p>

  <p>The fight for the Crowns of Destiny involved high stakes. Only the Supreme Lords and the world lords participated in the war. It had little influence on the warriors under the world lord level.</p>

  <p>Even though the Supreme Lords fought tooth and nail for the Crowns of Destiny, not a single one of them was killed. Six world lords were the only sacrifice of the war.</p>

  <p>In any case, it was a near impossible task to kill a warrior who had become a world lord and mastered the skill of spatial transference.</p>

  <p>It was proof of the Desperate Melee's powerful effect. Four Supreme Lords had died at the same time because of it.</p>

  <p>One of the three big human forces, named Thoughtless Minds and led by Supreme Lord of Original Sin, obtained two Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>The other two were taken by the Demon Night race and the ogres respectively.</p>

  <p>However, Yao did not feel too happy about obtaining a Crown of Destiny. Since Gunter had died because of the Desperate Melee, the Demon Night race still had the same number of Supreme Lords as before.</p>

  <p>It was the same with the ogres.</p>

  <p>As for the Thoughtless Minds, no Supreme Lords from their group had died previously. The newly obtained Crowns of Destiny undoubtedly enhanced their human force by a wide margin.</p>

  <p>The Thoughtless Minds had originally been the greatest force of the human race. They had controlled four thousand supreme worlds. Its leader, the Supreme Lord of Original Sin, was one of the few top-rank Supreme Lords in the universe, and his Heavenly Destiny contained an extremely powerful Law of Causality. After this particular war, two members of the Thoughtless Minds would become Supreme Lords. This fact was the cause of worry for the rest of the races and the other two big human forces? the Humanity Alliance and the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, knew nothing of these events in the outside world. Since he could not leave the Immortal Mansion, he decided to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>Time went by quickly.</p>

  <p>One year.</p>

  <p>Two years.</p>

  <p>Three years.</p>

  <p>Four years.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, five years had passed.</p>

  <p>To most warriors, five years were almost negligible compared to their long lives.</p>

  <p>Freya, for example, was much older than she looked. But for Luo Luo Zheng, five years was already a sixth of his past life.</p>

  <p>In these five years, Luo Luo Zheng experienced three big Heavenly Tribulations, while his cultivation base reached the middle stage of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>As for the seed of the World Tree, it grew inside Luo Zheng's Soul Sea of chaotic energy. A trunk also emerged from the surface of his Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>One day, the heavens suddenly shook again.</p>

  <p>This time, it was not because a Crown of Destiny had appeared. The one hundred and twenty-eight Supreme Lords were all alive, so no Crowns of Destiny were to appear.</p>

  <p>However, the creatures in the one hundred thousand supreme worlds around the universe paid close attention to it.</p>

  <p>They knew the Illusion Battlefield was about to begin.</p>
