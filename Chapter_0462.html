  <p>Killing aura was also referred to as the malicious aura.</p>

  <p>The gestures and expressions of soldiers and bandits, who had killed many people with their swords and knives, were filled with a malicious aura. As they had murdered numerous people, they were bound to be tainted with this killing aura.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the killing aura was so powerful that it could confuse the human mind and distract them on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>If a person were corrupted with an intense killing aura, it would negatively affect his martial arts cultivation. At a critical time, that person could also be possessed by his inner demon and be trapped in the endless thought of killing methods forever.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man named Trent Yu. He hailed from the Yu Clan, one of the top seven noble clans in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Trent Yu practiced these killing methods. As he increased his practice in killing methods, Trent Yu's character turned increasingly cruel, and his killing means also became more vicious. In a short while, he had massacred innumerable people at random.</p>

  <p>At first, the Yu Clan protected Trent Yu. After all, at that time, all things were dominated by power and strength, and the practice of killing methods had obvious benefits to the promotion of strength. In fact, its power was extremely terrifying. According to Trent Yu's growth rate, he would soon become the backbone of the Yu Clan. Therefore, they allowed Trent Yu to kill randomly.</p>

  <p>However, as time went by, Trent Yu killed more and more people, and once, he even killed two men from the Yu Clan. Then, the members of the Yu Clan realized that Trent Yu had gone crazy and that the killing aura had entirely dominated him. He had, by then, become an egoistic killing machine.</p>

  <p>Sadly, by the time they learned of the facts, it was already too late. The power of the Yu Clan was insufficient to arrest Trent Yu. Thus, the Yu Clan united with the other six top noble clans to carry out the encirclement and arrest of Trent Yu. However, he killed a majority of the members who had volunteered to help. This act, in turn, increased his killing aura.</p>

  <p>After that, Trent Yu only continued to grow stronger. Finally, Cloud Sect was alerted. As a result, the sect immediately issued a hunting order and sent its top ten saints, and three elders to hunt him.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, despite being hunted by so many powerful masters, Trent Yu managed to escape.</p>

  <p>At that time, Trent Yu was considered a murderous demon in the Eastern Region. While he was on the run, he kept killing innocent people. No matter which prefecture and county he fled to, Trent Yu would massacre people to cultivate his killing aura.</p>

  <p>This man had become a nightmare for all the people in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Even the leaders of Cloud Sect felt as though they were at their wit's end and that they had no way to deal with Trent. At this time, Trent Yu went missing. No one knew where he was and why he had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Many people guessed that either Trent Yu was hiding somewhere to escape being hunted or he was practicing his killing methods in a hidden corner.</p>

  <p>Three years passed, and no one had any information about Trent Yu.</p>

  <p>Until one day, a woodcutter in the W County found Trent Yu's remains and his blood-stained sword when he was on the way to a mountain to cut wood.</p>

  <p>It turned out that Trent Yu was not hiding. Instead, while practicing, he had been possessed by his inner spirit demon. As a result, he had gone mad and been killed by his killing aura.</p>

  <p>There is a proverb that says: As a man sows, so shall he reap. Although the practice of the killing method could sharply improve a person's martial arts, its deadly side effect was that the power was so strong it was beyond a person's ability to control it. Trent Yu had killed too many people with his sword, and it was bound to bring him bad karma!</p>

  <p>The killing aura was indeed Trent Yu's greatest strength, but it was also his biggest nemesis— one that could kill him.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not choose the killing way to practice his sword skills. However, it was fate that led him to figure out the sword intent at the consummation grade. For the same reason, he unwittingly entered the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Or, the unfathomable God of fate gave Zheng a hint that sooner or later he would go on the path of killing, which was why it was arranged for him to enter the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain was a sacred place for swordsmen. It was one of the three swordplay holy lands.</p>

  <p>As it was a sacred place for trillions of living creatures, only a few lucky people would be chosen to enter. So, the Killing Sword Mountain was of great use to swordsmen.</p>

  <p>As long as the swordsman inserted his sword into the Killing Sword Mountain, he could establish a connection with it, release his killing aura, and deposit it in the special place of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>That way, he would not be subjected to the attack of the killing aura during his practice!</p>

  <p>And when the swordsman needed the killing aura, he could get it back from the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain was like a bank where a person could deposit and withdraw his killing aura, kind of like real banks in the Eastern Region where a person could deposit and withdraw cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>Also, according to the rules of the Killing Sword Mountain, the higher the place where the sword was inserted, the more malicious aura the swordsman could deposit and withdraw!</p>

  <p>It was necessary to know that the killing aura was a very valuable asset, and it was also called the malicious aura. When it was used to drive many cultivation methods, it would significantly improve a disciple's power. Especially when a disciple was practicing a unique cultivation method that would use malicious aura, it would generate an oddly good effect.</p>

  <p>For example, if a streak of malicious aura could increase the power of a cultivation method by one degree, then two streaks could double the power of the cultivation method, and so on.</p>

  <p>However, there was always a limit to the malicious aura owned by disciples who practiced the killing method. Moreover, they needed to be careful about being attacked by the malicious aura and to prevent themselves from being controlled by their inner spirit demon.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the practice of killing method was regarded as a double-edged sword! Powerful though it was, it could at any moment cause damage to anyone who practiced it.</p>
