<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>He was naturally unhappy to do hard manual labor after he had ascended to the Upper World, but Zheng did not hold grudges against anyone.</p>

  <p>Back then, if he had let Yolande extradite him or even left with the Celestial Position members, he would not have been treated like this.</p>

  <p>However, since he wished to ascend on his own, he had to now face all kinds of things all by himself. He had left himself no other choice but to move on.</p>

  <p>Zheng flew for a while and soon discovered that the woman in plain clothes had been following him all the way.</p>

  <p>He stopped at once. Turning around, he asked, "Why are you following me?"</p>

  <p>The woman in plain clothes flashed him a small smile. "Oh, nothing! I just think I would be lucky to dig minerals with you."</p>

  <p>"You haven't asked me if I am okay with that," Zheng said faintly.</p>

  <p>His words slightly stunned the woman.</p>

  <p>In fact, no one would expect a Life and Death Realm warrior to speak like this to a Soul Sea Realm master. One would think that a warrior at the Life and Death Realm would be eager to tag along with a Soul Sea Realm master. How could Zheng, a Life and Death Realm warrior, have no desire to be with her?</p>

  <p>The woman in plain clothes smiled. "Okay. So do you mind me following you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged casually. "It's up to you."</p>

  <p>"Okay. My name is Freya Mu. May I know your name?" the woman inquired him.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng uttered his name, he flew toward the mountain range without lingering for another moment.</p>

  <p>Freya Mu stared blankly at Zheng's back, her exquisite face betraying a helpless and bitter smile. She thought that Zheng was just a Life and Death Realm warrior, but he was also arrogant. It seemed that he really had extraordinary abilities. She instinctively felt him to be very special. If she followed him, it would only help her fortune.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Over the years, many warriors had entered the mountain range and returned with a plethora of treasures. Of course, there were some who never returned at all, becoming lifeless corpses on the mountains.</p>

  <p>The range had a total of over a hundred huge mountains, each one a hundred thousand feet tall. They were covered with mine holes of various sizes. These pits had been excavated by the predecessor warriors bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Zheng had gathered information about the distribution of life vitality crystals across the mountains.</p>

  <p>There were many low-grade life vitality crystals on the top layer of the mountain range. If such a mountain range was found in the Lower World or even the Central Region, it would have been considered a rich mine.</p>

  <p>However, the Soul Sea Realm masters present here ignored the low-grade life vitality crystals. They needed one trillion low-grade life vitality crystals in exchange for one hundred life vitality jades... The number they were expected to offer up was simply mind-boggling. It was easy to find low-grade life vitality crystals, but it would take them a long time to find so many of them.</p>

  <p>The middle layer of the mineral vein was covered with mid-grade life vitality crystals. The lower layer had supreme life vitality crystals. Life vitality jades could be found and dug in the bottom layer.</p>

  <p>The dangers to be encountered in each layer were different. For a Soul Sea Realm master, the top layer and the middle layer were almost completely safe. However, the lower and the bottom layer could well be dangerous.</p>

  <p>Zheng casually chose a pit and flew down into it. The walls of the cave were marred with traces of excavation. This place had probably been excavated countless times, so naturally, he would not waste any time here. Freya Mu, who was following Zheng closely, became increasingly curious. Where exactly did Zheng want to go? Could it be that he was planning to head straight to the bottom layer?</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, Zheng had entered the depths of the mine hole over ten thousand feet away from the entrance. This was already the lower layer of the hole. There was a good chance that Zheng could dig out the supreme life vitality crystals here.</p>

  <p>Everything was silent here. Only the occasional sound of dripping water could be heard. Still, Zheng did not stop once inside the dark hole.</p>

  <p>While he was flying, a few black shadows seemingly flapped their wings at the top of the cave. They quietly followed Zheng, aiming to charge straight at him while hiding in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Freya Mu seemed to have practiced a kind of special cultivation method which made her perception skills sharp. The few black shadows did not emit any aura, but she was still able to sense them easily.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, be careful!"</p>

  <p>However, just as she was about to take action, a sharp sword appeared in Zheng's hand. He swung it casually and then it dematerialized. He did all this without stopping for a second or turning his head, as if there were a pair of eyes stuck at the back of his head.</p>

  <p>"They were just some tenth-level fierce beasts..." Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>Freya Mu, who still followed him, smiled wryly. A tenth-level beast was equivalent to a Life and Death Realm warrior. Zheng was only at the Life and Death Realm, but he spoke so indifferently about it, as if he was much superior to the level.</p>

  <p>The sword attack that Zheng had displayed just now indeed surprised Freya Mu. She was born into a famous and powerful clan and had seen many masters in the Lower World. However, she had never seen a warrior slash out his sword and make such a sharp and strange arc. She assumed that Zheng was far more powerful than what his level suggested. It could not be measured from his cultivation base as it far surpassed that of an ordinary Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Freya Mu had already made certain conclusions in her head.</p>

  <p>As they continued moving forward, their surroundings began to change gradually. At first, the cave seemed to be made up of brown rock walls, but now the surrounding rock walls began to turn translucent and crystal clear, formed with pieces of pure quartz.</p>

  <p>Some other ores were embedded within the quartz, a few of them emitting a faint luster. Under the gentle shining light, the environment in the lower layer was not so depressing and dark.</p>

  <p>"This place is rather beautiful..." Freya Mu whispered as she glanced around.</p>

  <p>"But the supreme life vitality crystals have all been dug out." Zheng pointed at the marks carved into the walls of the cave. The other ores did not have much of an attraction for those who had ascended to the Upper World, but the supreme life vitality crystals had all been dug out and taken away.</p>

  <p>The supreme life vitality crystals were formed by the vitality between heaven and earth. It took a long time to form such crystals. As the mine had been continually excavated for so many years, the number of supreme life vitality crystals must have dwindled day by day.</p>

  <p>A newcomer like Zheng had to rely on his luck if he wanted to find the supreme life vitality crystals and take them out.</p>

  <p>"My fortune is not so bad today. I see one here!" Freya Mu was looking around. She discovered a supreme life vitality crystal not too far away.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled easily. He did not move but instead let Freya Mu go ahead to dig it out. He had to accumulate life vitality crystals if he intended to obtain a large number of them, but he did not really care about one or two stray pieces.</p>

  <p>However, as Freya Mu walked over, a look of surprise and joy washed over her face. "It's not just one crystal. There seems to be a cluster of them growing here!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng approached her, he saw through the sub-transparent quartz wall and found there was a mass of supreme life vitality crystals hiding inside. There might be several hundreds of them.</p>

  <p>"Look! I told you! My hunch is always right. I get luckier if I follow you." Freya Mu smiled, adding, "Let's share them equally!"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded noncommittally.</p>

  <p>In fact, Freya Mu's hunch had indeed been correct. When Zheng had been in the Central Region before, his fortune had been much discussed by others. They came to the conclusion that he was a warrior with great luck.</p>

  <p>A warrior like Eddie might also have had great luck, but he devoured the good fortune of the people around him to strengthen himself. Such had been the case with Marilyn and Simon. Their luck was devoured by him and they ended up being killed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's own fortune spread to the people around him, such as to Yudie, Margaret and even the fat men from the World Commercial Alliance...</p>

  <p>Freya Mu had the right inkling because she was sensitive to the luck of others. However, it was not easy to be sure of such a thing, so she could only rely on her intuition.</p>

  <p>She was also a warrior who practiced the Ice Law. As she leaned to the side, she reached out and flicked a hand lightly. A gust of sharp, chilly air spread out along the piece of quartz, freezing the entire cave wall. In the cold, the incomparably hard quartz became brittle and countless cracks appeared on its surface. As she gently stretched her hand and touched the wall, it collapsed in an instant. Several hundred supreme life vitality crystals revealed themselves before them.</p>
