<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Due to the battle between Mike's and Murphy's energy souls, the Rosy Cloud World was on the verge of collapse.</p>

  <p>Although the Upper World and the Lower World possessed the ability to repair themselves, the process was extremely long. Due to the severe damage caused by the battle, it was likely that the Rosy Cloud World would disintegrate.</p>

  <p>Right now, the priority of the tenth grade sacred places in the Rosy Cloud World was to transfer their members to somewhere safe and then think of measures to stabilize the world.</p>

  <p>The entire responsibility of restoring the Rosy Cloud World fell on Ying's shoulders.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, she had dispersed countless seeds of holy trees in the world. These gigantic plants could expand indefinitely. Once they were firmly rooted into the ground, they would intertwine and pull each other to close the huge crevices. Thus the world would be restored and stabilized.</p>

  <p>However, this was not the result of a single day's effort. It needed a long time to heal the wounds of the world.</p>

  <p>Finally, the peace of the Demon Night race was restored. Out of the statues of queens in the race's sacred places, two had been smothered once and for all. The members of the race knew very well that from now on, they would only have one queen.</p>

  <p>In addition, Xun had also pardoned the members of the Saint Chain Sect.</p>

  <p>Yao was the reason behind all sins. After all, the six sects of the Demon Night race instinctively supported their queens.</p>

  <p>Xun's pardon had relieved those Demon Night clansmen who followed Yao, though they clearly knew that with Yao's death, it would be very difficult for them to obtain Xun's trust, and it was unlikely that they would be placed in important positions any more.</p>

  <p>However, since they weren't killed in the chaos and also received their freedom, they were deeply grateful to Xun.</p>

  <p>Although Xun wasn't a kind-hearted person, she understood that the Demon Night race had already suffered enough after such a serious internal conflict. They really couldn't afford any more disorder.</p>

  <p>Xun and Luo Zheng were lying in a hammock made from the branches that swayed gently in the breeze. She bent her knees and curled up into a ball as much as possible to fit in Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Over the last few years, she had spent most of her time inside Zheng's body, treating his body as her home. Now that she had used Ying's spirit embryo to regain her original looks, she couldn't possibly stay any longer inside Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently caressed her silky skin and asked, "Have the people from the Saint Spear Sect been rescued?"</p>

  <p>He hadn't forgotten the agreement he made on the Illusion Battlefield. He wanted to save not only Amber, but also Hailey from the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Xun replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>The Saint Spear Sect had always been Xun's most important supporter. These days, the first thing she did was to gather the members of the Board of Elders and announce the sect's rehabilitation. Currently, in the entire Demon Night race, all three Supreme Lords were in favor of Xun and she was the sole queen of the race. How could the other sects dare to reject her? They could only obey her orders.</p>

  <p>"How is Supreme Lord Leroy now?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Xun was pressing her face against Zheng's chest. When she heard him mention Leroy, there was a trace of sadness on her face.</p>

  <p>Although she had returned to the throne, Leroy had unfortunately fallen into the Five Aging Processes. This was probably the worst thing that had happened in this period of time.</p>

  <p>In fact, the normal burning of life force would not cause a warrior to fall into the Five Aging Processes. In the past, Ning Yudie had almost used up all her life force, but she still remained young. However, the Blood-devouring Bone Arrows not only exhausted Leroy's life force, but also caused him to age rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Five Aging Processes was like a huge pit that was impossible to crawl out. If Leroy was just at the edge of the pit without falling down, then Xun could have done everything in her power to extend his lifespan. But he fell into the pit and there was nothing that Xun could do to pull him out.</p>

  <p>This was a rule of the Evolutionary Universe, and no one was an exception.</p>

  <p>"He's in secluded meditation inside a holy tree of the Square Spirit Sacred Place." The so-called secluded meditation was just an excuse.</p>

  <p>Xun very well knew that Leroy had been very depressed lately.</p>

  <p>Everyone wanted to live as long as possible, and eternal life was always the top goal in the universe.</p>

  <p>To the Supreme Lords, it was very painful and traumatic to fall into the Five Aging Processes. Their bodies would begin to age rapidly, and from their bodies, filthy and foul smelling substances would gush out.</p>

  <p>So to avoid further humiliation, they would find excuses to go into seclusion. In reality, they did not want their ugly looks to be known to the public. They gave in to fate and silently perished.</p>

  <p>"From what I can tell, the Five Aging Processes is a Law of Causality, isn't it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Xun thought for a moment and then nodded. It was not wrong to say that. It was just that no one wanted to bear the Law of Causality, and no one could avoid it.</p>

  <p>"What if I find a way to eliminate it?" Luo Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Xun blinked her eyes, confused. The first thought that entered her mind was, who in this world could escape from the passage of time?</p>

  <p>However, her doubts quickly vanished. Luo Zheng had special power after all, and he had never done anything that he was not sure of!</p>

  <p>The thought ran through her mind a few times before she came back to her senses. "Luo Zheng, do you really have a way to solve this problem?"</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was able to eliminate the Five Aging Processes, there was still a way for Xun to restore Leroy's life force.</p>

  <p>"I will give it a try." Luo Zheng was not completely sure. Although the book Enemy Repelling Arts could remove cause and effect, the Five Aging Processes wasn't in the form of Heavenly Destiny. Therefore, he didn't speak in absolute terms.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Xun revealed a bright smile. She gently flipped her body, and a bright red silk dress was instantly draped around her slender body. This was the first time Luo Zheng had seen her in this outfit.</p>

  <p>Xun had a nearly perfect figure, and in this outfit, she looked stunning and elegant. The spirit embryo had grown rapidly after being occupied by her. So she was less than a month old now.</p>

  <p>"Let's go now!"</p>

  <p>Square Spirit Sacred Place was a tenth grade sacred place that was the closest to the Inauguration Altar. In the absence of a Saint Lord, the Board of Elders directly controlled the place.</p>

  <p>When the people of the place saw Xun, they immediately paid their due respect. Many girls looked behind Xun, their eyes faintly discernible. They were curious about the appearance of the mysterious human youth in the universe.</p>

  <p>While staring at Luo Zheng up and down, they started whispering among themselves. Of course, they didn't dare to discuss in front of Xun.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed Xun into the holy tree of the Square Spirit Sacred Place. After passing through a narrow passageway, they found Leroy.</p>

  <p>The secluded meditation was meaningless for Leroy now. Supreme Lords only needed to constantly consolidate their Heavenly Destiny and use it to its fullest. Once they carried the Heavenly Destiny, they wouldn't be able to become Godly Geniuses, nor would they be able to obtain the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>He didn't cultivate in seclusion there. It would be more accurate to say that he was hiding here.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Xun entered, they could sense a foul stench.</p>

  <p>Leroy was a handsome man when he was young. Now, he didn't want anyone to see his ugly looks.</p>

  <p>"Who is trespassing? Back off!" Leroy shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>"It's me," Xun answered back.</p>

  <p>Leroy frowned, but he still paid his due respect. "My queen, what brings you here? It's intolerably dirty here. You shouldn't have come."</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes narrowed. "Stop that. I came precisely for this reason."</p>

  <p>"What reason? I don't follow you." Leroy was confused.</p>

  <p>"We'll try to help you eliminate the Five Aging Processes." Xun smiled.</p>

  <p>"What?" Upon hearing these words, Leroy rolled his yellow eyes. "My queen, are you trying to make fun of me?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Leroy was too arbitrary, but he had never heard that the Five Aging Processes could be eliminated. If there really was a way to get rid of it, no one would tremble with fear on hearing of it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if one could really eliminate the Five Aging Processes, he or she would never die. Before becoming a True God, this was obviously impossible.</p>

  <p>"That's why I will only give it a try, but I have confidence in it," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's words, Leroy felt his heart skip a beat. He had personally seen what Zheng's father did. As the master who constructed the universe, his father had set all the rules in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Leroy thought there was really a possibility.</p>

  <p>Leroy seemed to have grasped onto a lifesaving straw. His dull eyes were instantly ignited with passion.</p>
