<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The mountain that stood in front of Luo Luo Zheng looked like a wild beast from ancient times.</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of thousands of swords embedded in the mountain, one on top of the other, from the bottom to the top.</p>

  <p>"These swords..." Luo Luo Zheng, amazed by the sight, was suddenly at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>It was hard not to gasp in awe as he looked at those long swords protruding from the mountain.</p>

  <p>The metal blades at the foot of the mountain were not high grade. But all were classified as mysterious weapons, whether low-grade, middle-grade, or top-grade. A variety of sword types were in that mountain.</p>

  <p>There were wide blade swords, short-handle swords, serpentine swords, jade swords, and so on.</p>

  <p>The mysterious weapons of different grades spread from the foot of the mountain to the top. But when Luo Luo Zheng examined the slopes closer, he discovered the swords embedded there were not all the mysterious kind.</p>

  <p>There were also spiritual weapons!</p>

  <p>The spiritual weapons only covered the lowest portion of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Looking further up, Luo Luo Zheng found many more fairy weapons halfway up its slopes!</p>

  <p>To his amazement, there were low-grade, middle-grade, and even top-grade fairy weapons!</p>

  <p>Even a low-grade fairy weapon was tough enough to make the martial artists of the Eastern Region go crazy. Disciples from the declining noble clans like Nory, and even family-owners like James, didn't have a fairy weapon yet!</p>

  <p>The top seven noble clans might have more low-grade fairy weapons, but on average, each family would only have a few of these, at most.</p>

  <p>Middle-grade fairy weapons were even rarer. Only five of the top seven noble clans owned this type of weapon. The Yu and Yun Clans were the two that did not have middle-grade fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>Each of the top seven noble clans was fabulously wealthy and were known for having illustrious family backgrounds. And the inheritance that came down to the Yu and Yun Clans was no weaker than that of the other five clans, so it was puzzling why they had yet to possess a middle-grade fairy weapon. So, it was not difficult to imagine how precious the middle-grade fairy weapon was in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>As for the top-grade fairy weapon with three fairy textures...</p>

  <p>It was already legendary. It might exist in the Eastern Region, but no one had ever seen it.</p>

  <p>However, there were many and various fairy weapons halfway up the mountain. There were tens of thousands of middle-grade and top-grade fairy weapons as far as the eye could see.</p>

  <p>And it shocked Luo Luo Zheng to see so many of these fairy weapons stuck in the mountain. These were clumped together like cabbage, which anyone could take at no cost.</p>

  <p>"It will likely ignite every scale of the cyan dragon in my body if I can swallow all these mysterious weapons, spiritual weapons, and fairy weapons!"</p>

  <p>In his excitement, Luo Luo Zheng didn't realize he had voiced out his thoughts.</p>

  <p>His gaze wandered further beyond the fairy weapons, and Luo Luo Zheng found there were other swords that spread from the mountainside to the top ridge. What grade of swords could those be?</p>

  <p>"Sacred weapons..." Luo Luo Zheng murmured in wonderment.</p>

  <p>If people of the Eastern Region found it hard to imagine a top-grade fairy weapon as a kind of powerful weapon, what more would they think about a sacred weapon?</p>

  <p>What exactly was this sword mountain anyway?</p>

  <p>Why was the mountain immediately visible to him as soon as he comprehended the consummation of the sword intent?</p>

  <p>Clouds and mists shrouded the upmost part of the mountain, so Luo Luo Zheng was unable to see what was on it. But based on the way those swords were arranged presently, would there be divine weapons on top of the mountain?</p>

  <p>Using his present insight, Luo Luo Zheng could well imagine the power and strength of the sacred weapon. But the might of the divine weapon was beyond his imagination. He had no idea what the divine weapon looked like, nor could he visualize its strength.</p>

  <p>He had a sense that in imagining, he would make it appear ridiculous.</p>

  <p>As an example, he thought of peasants from remote mountains who believed the shoulder pole used by the emperor to carry water was made of gold since the royal leader had a lot of gold and silver jewelry. And that was ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Inhaling deeply, Luo Luo Zheng took a drink of water, restrained his cranky thoughts, and approached the sword mountain. When he reached the first mysterious weapon, he attempted to pry it out. But the low-grade weapon remained deeply embedded in the mountain and could not be pulled out.</p>

  <p>Initially, Luo Luo Zheng thought his strength was insufficient, thus his failure. But after expending all his energy, it remained stuck in the ground, hardly moving an inch.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng clearly heard a voice in his head.</p>

  <p>"It's a sword on the Killing Sword Mountain, so you cannot pull it out even if it is a mysterious weapon," he heard the voice say. It sounded quite old to him.</p>

  <p>Aghast at what he was experiencing, Luo Luo Zheng stood still and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Who am I?" the voice spoke, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"I've been inside your head for so long yet you don't even know who I am?" There was a hint of desolation and majesty in his tone as he replied.</p>

  <p>"The cyan dragon?</p>

  <p>You're the cyan dragon!" Luo Luo Zheng blurted out.</p>

  <p>The young disciple could not believe what was happening.</p>

  <p>He had suspected a long time ago that the cyan dragon had his own consciousness as a dragon. But he had never taken the initiative to communicate with him until Luo Luo Zheng competed with Jacques on the battlefield. The cyan dragon's goal then was to secure the flood dragon bone, and this was what eventually prompted him to roar so he could communicate with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was with the help of the cyan dragon that Luo Luo Zheng finally defeated Jacques and swallowed the flood dragon bone.</p>

  <p>So technically, Luo Luo Zheng didn't defeat Jacques with his strength alone but with the help of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't seem fair to Luo Luo Zheng to give all the credit for the victory to the dragon. After all, Jacques also took advantage of the flood dragon bone spear in his hands.</p>

  <p>The birth of a genius always depended on several aspects: strength, talent, adventure, and luck. And you could not do away with a single one of them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right. I am the cyan dragon in your mind," the dragon made the confirmation.</p>

  <p>It was when Luo Luo Zheng ignited the first of his dragon scales that the cyan dragon woke up.</p>

  <p>But he didn't have much reserve energy to communicate with the young disciple after waking up. He had been confined to the mysterious smelting furnace for so many years and was far too weak.</p>
