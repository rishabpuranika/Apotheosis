  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Abdul had a contempt for Zheng, his expression did not show it. "It can be said that the Land of Sword Grief has gathered most of the resources of the Oneness Sky Palace," he explained patiently. "But these resources are not given to good-for-nothing warriors."</p>

  <p>He said 'good-for-nothing warriors' emphatically as if his remarks were aimed at the hundred people in front of him.</p>

  <p>Many of them, including Elvinia, frowned after hearing him say this.</p>

  <p>Elvinia and Dorothy held high positions in the Oneness Sky Palace, and no one ever dared to speak to them with disrespect up until this moment. They were not pleased.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Abdul didn't care about what anyone thought and how they reacted. He turned around and pointed at the bronze palace. "There are more than 1, 100 people in the Land of Sword Grief." he said bluntly.</p>

  <p>"About 30 people on the third floor, 200 on the second floor, and then 900 on the first floor. Each of them possesses their own unique rankings."</p>

  <p>"Excuse us, Abdul," a Bright Mountain disciple spoke. "But when you last returned to the Bright Mountain, you were ranked 630th. I wonder how much you've managed to improve since then?" This man was furious, wanting so badly to embarrass him after everything he had said.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Abdul smirked and responded proudly, "I worked up the ranking in last month's challenge, and I am now ranked 570th."</p>

  <p>After Abdul bragged, warriors in the crowd began to chatter and whisper among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. I thought he is good especially because he speaks so arrogantly.</p>

  <p>He's ranked only 570th, and he still stays on the first floor."</p>

  <p>"In any case, that means this guy must have stayed on the first floor for around 20 years, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! He stays on the first floor, yet he shows off like he's from the third.</p>

  <p>What a guy."</p>

  <p>Among the new disciples, many of them were direct descendants of various mountains. Although they were new to the Land of Sword Grief, they knew the rules here all too well.</p>

  <p>Warriors were treated differently based on the floors they stood on. The disciples on different floors of the Land of Sword Grief also showed the gap in their strengths. Chance, who was also a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, ranked at the bottom on the first floor. He had been so harshly defeated by Zheng before.</p>

  <p>Because Abdul was a resident of the first floor, the direct descendants naturally looked down upon him.</p>

  <p>Abdul couldn't take the taunting and disrespect, a look of sudden anger flashing across his face.</p>

  <p>However, he managed to control his emotions and spoke in a calm voice,</p>

  <p>"In the Land of Sword Grief, there is a challenge every month. First timers, like yourselves, all rank at 1, 117th. However, you can fight one another to get a new ranking. You can also choose an opponent on the first floor to challenge and promote your ranking." As he said this, he paused and looked at them with intent. "Please know that the last one hundred in the new rankings will not have access to any resources."</p>

  <p>Abdul looked at the several direct descendants who once laughed at him but now filled with deep anxiousness. "Guys, I don't mind if you choose me to be your opponent," he sneered.</p>

  <p>Although Abdul was on the first floor, he and the others had spent many years wandering in the Desire World of the Other Shore after their cultivation base at the Chaotic Source Realm had stabilized.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens they carried were from Stage Fourteen and above.</p>

  <p>At this point, their strength was something that newcomers could not go against.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, how could these newcomers be so reckless and cocky to challenge them?</p>

  <p>They knew too well that most of them wouldn't be able to defeat even the longtime residents of the first floor.</p>

  <p>While Abdul noticed the newcomers grow silent, his attitude shifted from cocky to demanding. "Didn't some of you look down on the warriors of the first floor? What did you just say?"</p>

  <p>He pointed at a disciple from the crowd, a direct descendant of the Azure Mountain.</p>

  <p>The disciple lowered his head under the pressure that was just put on him by Abdul.</p>

  <p>"How about you?" Abdul turned towards another direct descendant. "Are you willing to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Shakily, the direct descendant took a few steps back, trying his best to disappear into the crowd.</p>

  <p>Other disciples in the bronze palace watched and smiled, seeing the newcomers shrivel up to Abdul's presence.</p>

  <p>"Abdul is bullying the newcomers," one pointed out.</p>

  <p>"But there is no better way to deal with them. These disciples just got here, and they're already so damn conceited."</p>

  <p>"They have no idea that the Chaotic Source Realm is merely a threshold for the other things they will encounter in the future."</p>

  <p>The disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were all well experienced, so seeing the newcomers come in so proudly disappointed them. They had seen countless arrogant warriors who had suffered much in their first battles.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Abdul's eyes finally fell on Elvinia.</p>

  <p>Elvinia was always the apple of everyone's eyes in the Phoenix Palace. She was the most honorable direct descendant.</p>

  <p>Abdul's goal was to suppress the newcomers, so seeing Elvinia gave him an idea. If he could suppress Elvinia, the other direct descendants would learn to keep their mouths shut.</p>

  <p>After all, the Land of Sword Grief was not a place for the arrogant warriors to enter just by means of high positions or special identities.</p>

  <p>Abdul walked up to Elvinia and smiled. "So I've heard that you are one of the outstanding warriors of the Phoenix Palace. Why don't you challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Elvinia and Dorothy didn't know how to react.</p>

  <p>After all, they didn't even care about the resources of the Land of Sword Grief or even the rankings.</p>

  <p>But hearing this, Elvinia had to think hard. With her current strength, she might not be able to defeat Abdul at the moment.</p>

  <p>Elvinia frowned at the thought of this and glanced at Zheng. Meanwhile, the other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace also ended up looking at Zheng.</p>

  <p>They had explored the Chaotic Source World together with Zheng, and they were very knowledgeable of Zheng's strength and capabilities.</p>

  <p>If he made the Inheritance of World descend, he'd be able to kill a great number of warriors in the Land of Sword Grief. However, Athemar and the leaders of various mountains had given a crucial order that the disciples couldn't bring up what had happened in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Moreover, almost all of them obtained Chaotic Source Spirits and reached the Chaotic Source Realm with Zheng's help. They owed him a lot for his kindness.</p>

  <p>That was why no one wanted to volunteer Zheng for Abdul's challenge.</p>

  <p>However, everyone still had a little hope that Zheng could stand up for them.</p>

  <p>Seeing everyone look at Zheng, Abdul turned around to face him. "It seems that everyone wants you to challenge me."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at Abdul with a calm, composed expression in his eyes. "I challenge you?" he said, pointing at himself and raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Dare you?" Abdul asked.</p>

  <p>"It's not a matter of whether I dare or not." Zheng smirked and put his hands behind his back. "You're too weak. You're not even qualified to fight me."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't intend to join the Land of Sword Grief at all, but he was loyal to the Oneness Sky Palace and their rules.</p>

  <p>If Abdul hadn't provoked Elvinia, Zheng would have just kept silent.</p>

  <p>But because he was so insistent on challenging Elvinia, how could Zheng possibly let this slide?</p>

  <p>After Abdul heard Zheng's response, his face went from arrogant to furious.</p>

  <p>Just then, a sharp light burst from his eyes like the sword radiance, and shot straight at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two men behind Abdul looked angry as well. How dare this newcomer speak with such disrespect!</p>

  <p>Likewise, the disciples in the bronze palace were surprised with Zheng's confidence.</p>

  <p>"Check this out! A troublemaker appears!"</p>

  <p>"I think I've seen that guy... He won first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting!"</p>

  <p>"So what? If one can't even figure out their real strength, they are bound to suffer!"</p>

  <p>The disciples on the first floor were discussing and debating Zheng and his arrogance towards Abdul.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the disciples on the second floor were much calmer.</p>

  <p>The first floor and the second floor were completely different. Those who were on the second floor usually had no business in the disputes in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>Therefore, only 20 to 30 warriors on the second floor came out to welcome the new members today. However, at this moment, Zheng's words attracted their attention.</p>
