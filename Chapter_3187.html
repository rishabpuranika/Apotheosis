  <p>
</p>

  <p>Cailen couldn't hide the nervousness in his face. Noticing his expression, Luo Zheng gave him a slight, soothing smile. "This is a reward from Master Goran," he said lightly.</p>

  <p>"A? a reward?"</p>

  <p>Cailen stammered. Instead of being reassured, his doubts intensified. Even Gant looked disbelieving.</p>

  <p>Although the Seven Mountains Meeting had been a heated and intense event, only warriors of the mountains belonging to the Taiyi Heaven Palace were allowed to attend. Most of the people in Dragon City simply weren't qualified to know anything about the meeting.</p>

  <p>So while Gant and Cailen had both heard of the Seven Mountains Meeting, neither of them was familiar with what happened during the event. They didn't know who won first place.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they didn't believe that Goran would just give Luo Zheng a premium Other Shore Treasure.</p>

  <p>"A premium Other Shore Treasure is precious, even to someone like Master Goran. Why should he give it to you?" asked Cailen in a bewildered tone. dozens of ideas crossed his mind one after the other.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone was solid and all but indestructible. Indeed, across the entire Bloom Divine Province, no one but the Su Clan had the ability to melt the stone and remake it into a weapon. If Luo Zheng had gotten this sword in an unethical way, he could only ask the Su Clan for help.</p>

  <p>Cailen could help Luo Zheng. But if his suspicion was true and Goran knew about it, how could the Su Clan be able to survive the consequences?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could tell from their anxious expressions what they were worried about. He smiled again and said, "I won the championship during the Seven Mountains Meeting. This sword is the reward given to me by Goran for my victory. Do you doubt my word?"</p>

  <p>"You won first place at Seven Mountains Meeting?" Cailen said incredulously, his eyes opening wide.</p>

  <p>Gant opened and closed his mouth like a fish, looking astonished. "Flag Master, you participated in the Seven Mountains Meeting? And won?"</p>

  <p>Some members of the Su Clan were also disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but none of them had been qualified to participate in the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>Cailen and Gant were amazed. Luo Zheng had been a disciple of the palace for a much shorter period of time compared to the Su Clan members, but now he had been invited to the Seven Mountains Meeting, and he had even won first place! It was incredible.</p>

  <p>"My master was well qualified not only to attend the Seven Mountains Meeting, but to win first place against everyone else. Why are you so surprised?" Trish interjected, grinning.</p>

  <p>Cailen coughed to cover his awkwardness.</p>

  <p>He gazed at Luo Zheng and felt that he had to revise his entire opinion of him.</p>

  <p>However, he could not quell the last tiny shred of doubt in his mind. He believed Luo Zheng was much more powerful than himself, but these claims were all just based on Luo Zheng's words. He could have planned an elaborate lie in advance.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's next words instantly banished all his doubts.</p>

  <p>"In addition to this Shade Phoenix Sword, I also have a hammer made from the Shade Stone. I'm hoping you can help me melt these two treasures," Luo Zheng said, showing them the hammer. He gave them a pleading look.</p>

  <p>"So... you have another treasure made from the Shade Stone? You have two in your possession?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it said that there's only one treasure made from the Shade Stone in the entire Bloom Divine Province?"</p>

  <p>Cailen and Gant stared at the precious hammer Luo Zheng had brought to them.</p>

  <p>They could tell that the hammer had been forged poorly, yet what Luo Zheng said was true: it was made from the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>"It was Master Hai who gave me this hammer. I want to accumulate more, but unfortunately I was only able to obtain two such treasures in this brief period of time," Luo Zheng said ruefully, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>'Only two? Only?'</p>

  <p>Cailen could see that Luo Zheng was serious, and he almost felt like crying. He recalled the long, hard work the Su Clan had done in order to forge a single weapon from the stone, the Shade Phoenix Sword. What Luo Zheng said made it sound so easy to get such a weapon.</p>

  <p>Then something else occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it would be fine to just melt this hammer to form a new Other Shore Treasure. After all, the Shade Phoenix Sword is already a top-tier weapon. You can't imagine the hours of labor spent into crafting that. It's too precious to destroy," Cailen said, hoping to persuade Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that Luo Zheng didn't need either of these two weapons at all. Luo Zheng only wanted the Shade Stones.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said firmly, "I'm not here to ask you for help with making new weapons. I only need you to help me melt these two treasures."</p>

  <p>"Melt? Do you mean to destroy them and turn them into Shade Stone liquid?" Cailen asked, finally understanding Luo Zheng's plan.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The only way to do that is by using your Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Cailen took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>This was probably the strangest request that he had ever heard.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only wanted these weapons melted. He didn't need them to be improved or transformed. Just melted.</p>

  <p>Cailen wondered why Luo Zheng wanted the Shade Stone liquid. Was he going to drink it?</p>

  <p>He remembered the Shade Stone liquid he had thrown to Luo Zheng in the Mountain Viewing Province. But of course he couldn't figure out the connection between Shade Stone and his body.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with the Shade Stone after melting it?" Cailen asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't answer that right now," Luo Zheng said politely.</p>

  <p>He had decided not to share with others his practice of using the Shade Stone liquid. Moreover, he did not want to invite further questions. If he explained his motives to Cailen, then Cailen would ask him about the Shade Stone liquid in the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>Cailen sighed. He explained to Luo Zheng, "I will try to help you, but I can't set the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array on my own. I must speak with the other members of my clan and see what they decide."</p>

  <p>"Before that, Flag Master, you can stay here tonight," Gant offered quickly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't in a hurry. He accepted Gant's invitation and stayed at the Su Clan's house that night.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, that same evening, Cailen gathered several members of the clan and explained Luo Zheng's request to them.</p>

  <p>When they heard what Luo Zheng wanted, several people furrowed their brows and exchanged solemn glances. Gant's uncles, in particular, looked quite severe.</p>

  <p>"Of course, we respect the talents of Luo Zheng. It's very impressive how he has already participated in the Seven Mountains Meeting after being in the mountain for less than half a year."</p>

  <p>"My son Nevyn has been in the mountain for thirteen years. He is still not qualified to be invited!"</p>

  <p>"We don't know what Luo Zheng plans to do with the Shade Stone liquid. He is only telling us one part of the story. It's better not to get involved with this!"</p>

  <p>As everyone spoke up, it became evident that the Su Clan was united? they did not want to grant Luo Zheng's request.</p>

  <p>Cailen's initial misgivings resurfaced at the vehement refusal of his fellow clan members. He wondered anxiously if he should tell Luo Zheng his request had been turned down.</p>

  <p>Raphael sat in a corner of the room and listened to the others talk. When there was a lull in the discussion, he took the opportunity to speak. He looked around at everyone and said, "The Ripple Pavilion competition is about to begin. Nevyn, Irving, and Osrid will be returning in a few days.</p>

  <p>They must know about the Seven Mountains Meeting. Why don't we just ask them about it when they arrive?"</p>

  <p>Although Cailen had invited him to join the discussion, Raphael held a low position in the Su Clan. Most of the time, no one took anything Raphael said seriously.</p>

  <p>But Cailen looked interested. He scratched his head, thinking, 'That's true, I didn't think of that...'</p>

  <p>The next day, Cailen went to Luo Zheng and asked him if he could wait for a little while. Cailen told him he needed a few days to prepare the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng agreed. He could afford to be patient, and he knew that melting the Shade Stone would be a long and slow process.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng waited, Gant took him and Trish to see the best places in Su City. They enjoyed their impromptu tour very much, although they were also eager to get updates from Cailen.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the transmission array located in the northern area of the Dragon City became very busy.</p>

  <p>During the first days of May, every year, the disciples of the great clans in the Bloom Divine Province returned home.</p>

  <p>So would the disciples of the seven mountains.</p>

  <p>Marco knew his arrival in the Clear Lake would be unexpected. Though some members of Marco's clan were still in Clear Lake, their main line had its roots in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Those who remained in Clear Lake were from the insignificant branches of the clan.</p>

  <p>Marco had only visited Clear Lake once, when he was young. When he came to visit this time, all the Xu Clan's branches in the city gathered to give him a proper greeting.</p>

  <p>It was a grand scene, but Marco did not seem to be enjoying the attention.</p>

  <p>His face was cold as frost. His three gloomy guards were equally stone-faced.</p>

  <p>He wasn't here for the Ripple Pavilion competition.</p>

  <p>In the wake of his humiliating defeat in the Heart Flow Sect, Marco began regretting the impulse that had driven him there. Of course, Luo Zheng was a member of the Heart Flow Sect now and they would stand united against outsiders. It had been very foolish of him to go to that sect to make trouble for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yet, upon discovering that Luo Zheng was also at Clear Lake, all the old resentment flared up again. He realized that fate had given him another opportunity, one he couldn't pass up.</p>
