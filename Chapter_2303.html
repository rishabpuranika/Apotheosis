<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the blood was drained from Ackley's face as he panted desperately and uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>Since he was a member of the Tang Clan, an ordinary mid-rank True God wouldn't dare offend him, let alone a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>He never expected that Zheng, who certainly wasn't an elite disciple from any large clan, dared to fight back and even wanted to kill him!</p>

  <p>Now however, his life was on the line. Thus, he refrained from saying anything that might irritate Zheng. Puffs of hot air escaped his lips as all he begged for at that moment was mercy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng really didn't want to provoke those disciples from the large clans.</p>

  <p>There were indeed many outstanding and highly talented people on the Floating Islands, but there were always some rotten fruits at the bottom of the fresh pile.</p>

  <p>He tried his best to avoid such kind of people, but Ackley had gone too far this time.</p>

  <p>Then again, his righteousness prevailed as he still had some scruples and did not have any intention of killing Ackley. After all, his identity was a sensitive issue and this place was not safe for him in any way.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A small breeze blew as Zheng lifted Ackley with force and smashed him against the disk.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what the disk was made of, but its surface was abnormally hard. Even though Ackley was a mid-rank True God, he still felt uncomfortable when he collided against its surface.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, Ackley was on his knees begging for mercy. After he landed on the ground, however, his attitude suddenly changed. He thought that it was just because Zheng's attack had caught him off guard but if it wasn't for that, Zheng would've never stood a chance against him!</p>

  <p>He stood up and released the power within his body with newfound hope. Yet before he could even steady himself, he saw a figure flash in front of him. It turned out to be Zheng, who raised his leg and kicked downwards.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The great force hit him square on the head. His legs gave away as he couldn't bear the immense pressure, and ended up kneeling in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"If you dare make another move, I will kill you straight. Don't think that I wouldn't dare to do so," Zheng coldly said and stared down at him.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng couldn't use the Faith Energy in his inner world and couldn't release his 'momentum, ' his strength had increased significantly after he had condensed the Godly Tile. In addition, the improvement of his cultivation level had also caused his body and soul to completely change.</p>

  <p>His cold aura hung above Ackley's neck like an invisible guillotine, ready to chop down anytime if Ackley moved even a bit. In the end, Ackley couldn't do anything but kneel still like an obedient dog.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the huge disk fell silent. All of them quietly observed Zheng and guessed about his background in their heads.</p>

  <p>The total number of True Gods from the 36 large clans on the Floating Islands, however, was over a million. The only time Zheng had fought in public was in the Holy Emperor City of the Han Clan, so no one on the disk had recognized him.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, he lifted his leg from Ackley, turned around, and stood aside. His eyes once again fell on the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>When Ackley saw that Zheng had distanced himself from him, he slowly got up from the ground. Even though he had undergone a great humiliation, he didn't dare fight back again.</p>

  <p>He couldn't see through Zheng's strength at all. Only the disciples of the Holy Emperors could have such power as a low-rank True God, but this guy in front of him... 'Which clan does he belong to? Why haven't I seen him before?' Ackley wondered.</p>

  <p>Some members of the Han Clan were also present. They had left the Floating Island together with Zheng, so they clearly knew that he belonged to the Han Clan. However, they didn't spread this piece of information.</p>

  <p>After all, they belonged to a same Floating Island, the same clan.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a small black dot appeared on the distant Time Sea. All the True Gods on the round disk immediately broke into cold sweats at the sight of the black dot.</p>

  <p>They were only present because they had to wait for the Sun Blind race's invitation. Now, a boat had arrived to invite someone, and no one knew who the lucky person would be.</p>

  <p>The small black dot continued to approach them rapidly. A young man from the Sun Blind race rowed the boat, and it took him only about half a minute to arrive at the huge disk. When it stopped, everyone held their breaths as they anticipated with excitement.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The young man from the Sun Blind race whistled sharply, and pointed at Ackley at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Me?" Ackley exclaimed as he slowly pointed to himself. He couldn't believe what he just heard. All of the humiliation he had felt until that point seemed to be gone at that moment.</p>

  <p>He silently jumped up and boarded the boat. Suddenly, his eyes lit up as if he had remembered something, and then he turned his head towards Zheng. "Hey! Are you still expecting to be invited by the Sun Blind race?</p>

  <p>Maybe in your next life!" he taunted with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Ackley was truly happy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng simply crossed his arms and looked at Ackley with dead eyes, and his face remained stoic as ever.</p>

  <p>As for the others, they couldn't help but be envious of Ackley. Against all odds, Ackley had actually received the Sun Blind race's invitation.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the boat sailed away and everyone was quiet again. Then, someone quickly pointed to the distance and said, "Look! There comes another boat!"</p>

  <p>The rest of them looked in the direction he pointed and saw a larger black dot appear on the sea surface. The black dot repeatedly neared them, until they realized that it appeared to be a large ship.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Sun Blind race used two kinds of boats. The first one was a small boat that could only carry one passenger. A member of the Sun Blind race usually rowed it. The second one was a large ship that was several hundred feet long. Back then when the Zhou Clan's Floating Island had fallen into the sea, such a ship had been used to evacuate the disciples of the Zhou Clan. Nowadays, it was rare to see one.</p>

  <p>"Why did they send a large dragon-bone ship here?"</p>

  <p>"Are they going to invite all of us there?"</p>

  <p>"In your dreams..."</p>

  <p>Despite the large dragon-bone ship's appearance, the True Gods didn't think that it was sent to pick someone up. Considering the members of the Sun Blind race's personalities, not even a consummate True God could receive such treatment from them. The first group of people who were taken away included the consummate True Gods of the large clans.</p>

  <p>All of them had taken small boats to leave.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes followed the big ship as it neared slowly. On the ship's deck stood an old man from the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>"It's him," Zheng said. He recognized the old man. He was the ferryman he had met when he had entered the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"Our distinguished guest, we sincerely invite you to join our Astronomical Transit Day gala," the old man politely said as he gestured Zheng to get on board.</p>

  <p>A faint smile made its way to Zheng's lips as he took two steps forward. He tapped the edge of the platform with his toe, then he flew into the air and gently landed on the deck like a bird.</p>

  <p>The True Gods on the huge disk watched the scene incredulously. They stared at Zheng blankly and couldn't understand why that happened.</p>

  <p>"Who, who the hell is he?"</p>

  <p>"How could he get such a treatment from them?"</p>

  <p>"Only the Holy Emperors are qualified to board the dragon-bone ships, right?"</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Holy Emperors could enjoy this treatment, but they were different from the consummate True Gods. The consummate True Gods were forbidden to use the spatial transference skill on the Time Sea, but the Holy Emperors and the Demi-holy Beings were allowed to do so and they did not need to be taken by the Sun Blind race with ships.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng was probably the first one to be picked up by a dragon-bone ship on the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the island!" The old man shouted.</p>

  <p>A large ship like the dragon-bone ship needed over ten people of the Sun Blind race to steer it, which naturally made it faster than ordinary small boats.</p>

  <p>It had only been a while since Ackley had left, so the ship Zheng had taken soon caught up with the small boat.</p>

  <p>The wind gently blew through Zheng's hair as he stood on the deck. He looked down and saw Ackley on the small boat.</p>

  <p>Ackley looked up as well and saw Zheng. His lips subconsciously twitched a few times. He too, stared at Zheng dumbfoundedly like those True Gods on the disk. He immediately felt rather insignificant in the presence of the large ship.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The ship moved with a sudden burst of speed, which caused large waves that rocked the small boat.</p>

  <p>Ackley turned to the young man who steered their boat and couldn't help but ask, "Why could that guy ride a big ship? What the hell are you thinking about? Who the hell is he?"</p>

  <p>Yet, the young man only shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>For the majority of the time, the members of the Sun Blind race did not say a word, but they were able to communicate with each other even in silence. Besides, the young man couldn't possibly answer such questions.</p>
