<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2429 Marsh Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Tree was the largest out of the four divine trees. Standing tall and glorious with its massive trunk, its top was easily as large as a quaint region in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was so humongous that the Sword Clan managed to build sixteen divine cities around the top of its trunk, a testament to its powerful size.</p>

  <p>The Orchid Sword Divine City, the divine city where Zheng participated in the second round of screening, was located on the edge of the tree trunk. He couldn't help but admire the Sunrest Tree for its otherworldly appearance.</p>

  <p>He was not a stranger to beautiful, mysterious places, but the Sunrest Tree was arguably one of the most astonishing places he'd been to. It was simply unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Originally, after the screening, Zheng should be with Enoch and the other True Gods who had passed, so they could move to the Sword Clan's ancestral land— the Heavenly Sword Divine City— together to participate in the debate over the Godly Ways, but the plans had changed.</p>

  <p>With the sudden arrival of Harold, both Zheng and Yan were permitted to go to the Heavenly Sword Divine City ahead of the other participants, because, as per the rules of the Sword Clan, all the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands were given the permission to send several disciples to join the debate without undergoing the screening process.</p>

  <p>Being fortunate enough as their Floating Island did not fall into the Time Sea, the Luo Clan was still a big clan, so Zheng and Yan could join the debate directly.</p>

  <p>Zheng soon found himself entering a palace of the Sword Clan. It was a grand and exquisite palace located in the north of the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>He lifted his gaze and studied the long historic walls with admiration.</p>

  <p>They were filled with a series of breathtaking frescoes he'd never seen before.</p>

  <p>The frescoes showed various pictures of a True God wielding his sword in refined but mysterious ways. Each image was different than the last, and Zheng found himself immensely absorbed in studying every intricate detail he could lay his eyes on.</p>

  <p>"This kind of swordsmanship is powerful and daunting in the divine land.</p>

  <p>But here, in this place, it's just a mural?"</p>

  <p>Zheng mumbled with a sigh, unable to pry his eyes away.</p>

  <p>Yan sat on the steps nearby, her hands supporting her head, as she stared at her brother, who was still lost in his own world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Harold, who was standing behind Zheng, said in a flat voice, "The Sword Clan is called the Sword Clan because their style of swordsmanship is unique. They have spent a lot of time and effort practicing sword skills, and no one else has ever managed to challenge them since. It's a pity that they are still too pedantic, though." He couldn't help but shake his head at the thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked, turning to him. "Pedantic? What do you mean?" he asked, curious.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile on his face, Harold answered, "The Sword Clan requires its members to be merciful. They even have the Theory on Moral Spirit to back that up. See, they are pedantic to the core!"</p>

  <p>Zheng furrowed his brows, unable to agree with him.</p>

  <p>All the Sword Clan members that he had come into contact with were righteous and kind. That alone was rare in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you mean, Harold," Zheng said, perplexed, a soft frown marring his face.</p>

  <p>With a sigh, Harold flicked his gaze to the frescoes and said, "The Sword Clan has developed well in the Non-combat Zone. However, because of their good and righteous nature, they're not as prosperous as the Dongfang Clan. Their good will and gentle heart are no doubt their sole weaknesses."</p>

  <p>"Does that really mean that they are indeed inferior?" Zheng asked, doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you've misunderstood me," Harold responded. "The Sword Clan members are all kind and merciful indeed. Back then, your father hoped to join hands with them, but they refused. If only they had accepted his offer, then for sure the divine land wouldn't have fallen into such a crisis. Up until now, I am still trying to convince the Sword Clan to cooperate with us, but all this push and pull are leading us nowhere. The price we have paid is much higher than before, and the chances are even slimmer now!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Zheng was even more confused now.</p>

  <p>But he could vaguely tell from Harold's words that when his father was still competing against the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, the Sword Clan could've had chosen to stand beside him.</p>

  <p>With their strength and prowess, they possessed the qualification to fight against the alliance of the wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>However, the Sword Clan members ultimately chose to look the other way and stay neutral because of their core values.</p>

  <p>No wonder Harold would always flare with anger every time the topic would come up.</p>

  <p>"Harold, did you manage to force the Sword Clan to help us?" Zheng asked, intrigued.</p>

  <p>Harold nodded his head. Narrowing his eyes, he added, "Yes. To put it more precisely, I didn't force the Sword Clan to do anything, but the situation at hand forced them to do so. Now, the Sword Clan is swimming in anxiety."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he threw several glances at the door of the palace and sneered.</p>

  <p>"It seems they are even more anxious than I thought. That old man, Marsh, is already here."</p>

  <p>As soon as he said that, the door of the palace slammed open, creating a reverberating sound.</p>

  <p>Two rows of Sword Clan members marched into the palace.</p>

  <p>Between the two squads, an old man made his way over to them, his gait slow and steady.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately took note of his immense aura. The old man had a look that could make an entire world cower in fear.</p>

  <p>His body was average at best, nothing spectacular or different, and yet there was a huge universe hidden within it where countless secondary creatures lived and thrived.</p>

  <p>Realization crashed over him like an avalanche of snow. 'He is a Holy Being!' Zheng thought, his eyes flashing with recognition.</p>

  <p>This old man was a Holy Being of the Sword Clan. Zheng couldn't be mistaken. He'd seen him before outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land, and he could distinctively remember the old man asking him about the whereabouts of Mikail.</p>

  <p>"It is quite rude for Mike's disciple to call me an old man. You should know it is a grave offense to disrespect a Holy Being," the old man said in a stony voice, throwing a displeased look at Harold.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Yan bowed to the Holy Being in respect, making the connection.</p>

  <p>This man was Marsh Sword, the one Harold mentioned earlier.</p>

  <p>Unlike the siblings, Harold made no move to show his courtesies to Marsh Sword. Instead, he snorted. "You have a pair of sharp ears," he commented.</p>

  <p>Despite the rude behavior, Marsh Sword remained calm.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Zheng with deep, assessing eyes before he deemed him unimportant and shifted his attention to Yan.</p>

  <p>"Is this your hope?"</p>

  <p>Intimidated by his presence and attention, Yan blushed beet red and fought the urge to hide behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, she was already aware of the heavy burden placed on her shoulders and pushed down her fear. She stood her ground, squared her shoulders, and raised her chin as a gesture of confidence.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is," Harold confirmed, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>Marsh Sword assessed Yan with probing eyes for what felt like an eternity before he summoned a long sword out of thin air.</p>

  <p>Dropping into a fighting stance, he went straight to Yan.</p>

  <p>It was virtually impossible for one to harbor and summon killing intent in the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>But this was still the Sword Clan's territory, and none of them knew what kind of power and method this Holy Being had. They were blind to his abilities.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw his attack, his face darkened and the urge to protect Yan surged in his chest like hot fire. He was about to step forward and defend her when Harold placed a hand on his shoulder, keeping him in place.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. He won't hurt Yan," Harold reassured.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Harold would never do anything to put Yan in grave danger, Zheng stepped aside.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yan stood still in shock, looking on at Marsh Sword with rounded eyes.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>After a split second, Yan's eyes shone just as a white mist began to leak out of her.</p>

  <p>Wisps of air formed and went around her body like a protective shell.</p>

  <p>Then an invisible aura spread out of her, extending outward into the hall.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had a startling realization when he felt and noticed the aura coming out of his sister.</p>

  <p>This was not an attack meant to harm Yan. Instead, Marsh Sword was using this battle to gauge and test Yan's Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>If he would be honest, he himself had no inkling as to what kind of Truth of Godly Way his sister had cultivated.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was very proficient in the Truth of Cultivation Nature, so he focused on Yan to feel and distinguish her Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>As he tried to get a read on her power, he came to an understanding that his sister had also mastered the Truth of Godly Way to a much deeper level.</p>

  <p>One step, two steps, three steps...</p>

  <p>With each passing second, Marsh Sword was getting closer and closer, his blade glinting in the air.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>While he was still a good distance away from Yan, everyone in the hall heard the sound of cloth tearing apart. A sound so distinctive and loud despite the commotion.</p>

  <p>There was no physical contact made, and yet it felt as if he managed to pierce through Yan's aura.</p>

  <p>Despite the brunt of his force, Yan remained collected and closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>She cast her head low and recited something in her head.</p>

  <p>As she finished the words in silence, her aura intensified and became more aggressive, effectively slowing down Marsh Sword's advances.</p>

  <p>In the end, the tip of his sword stopped inches from her forehead. Sensing that the fight had concluded, Marsh Sword then stepped backward, setting his weapon aside. The blade disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>He nodded and looked at Harold, saying, "She is not bad, I'd admit, but she hasn't reached the level that you have promised."</p>
