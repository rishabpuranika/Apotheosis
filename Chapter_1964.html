  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Luo Nian was only eleven years old, he had wonderful handwriting? much like the style of a famous calligrapher.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng just stood silently beside Luo Nian and watched him write. The longer he watched, the more amazed he felt.</p>

  <p>It was only one word of golden Sanskrit, but he had written over a thousand words to explain it.</p>

  <p>Just like Holy Jay had said, these top extraordinary creatures were advanced beings. Their ways of existence and communication were difficult to understand!</p>

  <p>At this stage, the entire divine land was still trying to comprehend these extraordinary creatures. Furthermore, they had only obtained a portion of this race's language. There was no other way to explain it: Understanding them was hardship.</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian had written out the last word, he looked up and smiled at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book eagerly reached out his hand to snatch the piece of manuscript, but Luo Nian slightly moved his hand and passed it to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book could do nothing but glare at Luo Nian. He couldn't do anything about Luo Nian, let alone to Luo Luo Zheng, who was his owner.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grabbed his son's manuscript and began to read it word by word, the curiosity no longer just an expression, but an action.</p>

  <p>"The golden Sanskrit word seems to be used to describe a certain place's scenery. It seems to be a lake, doesn't it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian nodded and answered, "Probably. Besides, this lake would be outside of the divine land."</p>

  <p>"You know about the divine land?" Luo Luo Zheng could barely believe what he was hearing, especially from his son's mouth.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian rolled his eyes, giving him the look of a real old soul, as if it was only normal for him to know about the divine land.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book next to him chuckled anew and said, "This little guy has been very diligent these past years. He has read through many ancient books in the library. He may know even more than you, Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but feel quite ashamed.</p>

  <p>Even though he had opened the library, he hadn't spent much time reading. Generally speaking, he acted like a utilitarian. He only took the cultivation methods that he needed from the library.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't to blame because he had always been troubled by many crises, leaving him little time to spend on reading.</p>

  <p>Even right now, Luo Luo Zheng still had a heavy burden on him.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was intelligent, and he should have also inherited Luo Zheng's talent.</p>

  <p>Although he had no intention for training in martial arts, he would naturally be capable of achieving good results if he put his talent forth on something else.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly skimmed through the thousand words and grasped a general idea of what it said.</p>

  <p>The owner of this Immortal Mansion, Luo Zheng's master, Bromley, was still traveling in the endless chaos.</p>

  <p>In the Chaotic Storm Chronicle, there was a record of Bromley's passage through the chaos. In his exploration, Bromley hadn't discovered any other civilizations. In the endless chaos, other than the boundless chaotic energy, there was nothing but an unbreakable lightning bolt. It was an empty and lonely world.</p>

  <p>According to Luo Nian's manuscript, the golden Sanskrit word seemed to record the existence of a huge lake amidst the chaos. It was a dark blue lake, which was fairly large. But as to the specific area of the body of water, Luo Nian couldn't describe it. After all, the extraordinary creature's distance scale was completely different from that of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The lake was located somewhere in the depths of the chaos. As for whether or not the lake was a gathering place for extraordinary creatures, it was impossible to tell from the golden Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that the information recorded in the golden Sanskrit word isn't of much value," Luo Luo Zheng said regretfully after reading it.</p>

  <p>At Luo Zheng's most recent utterances, Saul and Immortal Book both immediately laughed.</p>

  <p>"This was already quite a shocking discovery," said Immortal Book, shaking his head at Luo Luo Zheng. Then he added, "In the divine land, the value of this piece of manuscript is hard to imagine? You'll know when you go there."</p>

  <p>Saul also nodded in agreement and said, "Master, you have indeed underestimated the value of this golden Sanskrit word."</p>

  <p>The divine land was an unknown world to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After countless eras of development, the entire divine land had already reached its peak. When civilization reached this step, the only way was to expand outwards. But that endless chaos actually covered the divine land, and the place looked like a lonely island.</p>

  <p>In this case, the golden Sanskrit represented the information that was outside of the island. Even if the record was boring, it still had an extraordinary value in the divine land, not to mention the fact that it was about a lake!</p>

  <p>In the future, when Luo Luo Zheng went to the divine land and learned the value of this translation, he would have a different understanding of it, and would even marvel at how precious it was.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only understand a small part of what Immortal Book and Saul had said. He revealed a gratified expression and said, "Luo Nian has indeed grown up!" With that, he handed the stack of papers over to Immortal Book. After reading it himself, Immortal Book carefully stored it away with the others.</p>

  <p>That was when the small group of people suddenly heard a series of banging sounds coming from the entrance of the library.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! Luo Luo Zheng! You're back!"</p>

  <p>An iron puppet charged into the library.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the individual, Ning Yudie slightly stepped in front of her son in order to protect him. Her face revealed a trace of vigilance.</p>

  <p>They had stayed in the Immortal Mansion for a few years now, so they had long since known that there was a strange iron-made monster in the weapon refining workshop.</p>

  <p>This puppet was different from Immortal Book and Saul, though.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book was amiable and approachable, while Saul was extremely respectful. Most importantly, the two of them actually looked no different from regular humans.</p>

  <p>As for the iron-made monster in the weapon refining workshop, not only did he have a strange personality, his appearance was also unnatural, like an iron man stuck in a glass jar.</p>

  <p>"Livingston!" Luo Luo Zheng bared his teeth when he saw the iron-made man.</p>

  <p>Livingston walked clatteringly to Luo Luo Zheng and circled around him a few times, continuously sizing up Luo Zheng's physical body. He finally stammered his question, "Are, are you still Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Livingston asked this because he sensed a trace of an unusual Mu Ning coming off Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>BOOM! BOOM!</p>

  <p>Then Livingston reached out his hand? his iron pincer, rather? and struck Luo Zheng's body. "You! What happened to your body?!" he asked, in a rather agitated voice.</p>

  <p>When others simply looked at Luo Luo Zheng, they only felt that his cultivation base had increased, and perhaps that his Mu Ning had become more pure and calm overall.</p>

  <p>Livingston on the other hand, could clearly see that there had been an extraordinary change in Luo Zheng's body!</p>

  <p>Deep inside himself, he felt that Luo Zheng's physical body had undergone a qualitative change. It was as if Luo Luo Zheng had encountered an extremely skilled weapon refiner who had transformed his physical body!</p>

  <p>If he were to compare the Luo Luo Zheng of the past with the Luo Luo Zheng of the present, then the former would resemble a pile of scrap metal next to the latter.</p>

  <p>This was an instinctive feeling for Livingston. What made him even more bewildered was the method for tempering Luo Luo Zheng. Such was a powerful one, far beyond his own imagination. "This is so strange! Luo Luo Zheng, where in the world did you receive such tempering?!"</p>

  <p>It had only been a few years since Luo Luo Zheng had left the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Livingston could clearly see the traces of time engraved on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng smiled slightly but omitted to reply right away.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, Luo Luo Zheng was over eighty thousand years old now, but his bones couldn't accurately reflect his true age.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng held his silence, Livingston too stopped asking. He chuckled and said, "Since you've returned, I'll show you the results.</p>

  <p>Follow me, quickly!"</p>

  <p>Once Livingston had finished speaking, he grabbed Luo Luo Zheng and began dragging him at running speed toward the weapon refining workshop.</p>

  <p>At the sight of his father being dragged away by Livingston, Luo Nian couldn't help but immediately follow them.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was at the age where curiosity usually got the best of him. He was curious about everything. He was interested in every part of the Immortal Mansion, and the weapon refining workshop was no exception. This iron monster though, was too bizarre; his mother never allowed him to go near the weapon refining workshop anyway.</p>

  <p>Now that he had his father leading the way, Luo Nian naturally felt like he had nothing to fear.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the weapon refining workshop, Livingston suddenly struck the enormous weapon refining furnace.</p>

  <p>Clank!</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, the furnace's mouth clanged open. Within the furnace, there was a long, thin and sharp treasure sword, shining with a dazzling shimmer.</p>

  <p>"Is this the sword embryo?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Livingston's face revealed a proud look and he replied, laughingly, "This heavy sword, made from Star Essence Iron, is basically formed. It's just that there's a little problem with the sword hilt."</p>

  <p>The little problem Livingston spoke of was actually an extremely fatal one. This sword was too heavy.</p>
