  <p>
</p>

  <p>Livingston threw himself crazily onto the cyan brick, as if he had met his most beloved lover after a long absence.</p>

  <p>After lying on the ground for a short while, his gaze shifted to the wide open space in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>He then lay down on the ground again and began to carefully observe the details on the floor which was over one hundred feet in length and width.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>After a while, he let out a high-pitched shriek of excitement.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards, he used his claw to carefully tap on the floor and shouted in disbelief, "This is emperor vigor stone, a genuine emperor vigor stone! All my life, I've only seen a piece of emperor vigor stone once, and it was only palm-sized."</p>

  <p>Livingston had enjoyed an exceptionally long lifespan, even longer than those of some of the Supreme Lords. Just as the puppet had said, the emperor vigor stone was indeed extremely rare.</p>

  <p>However, the floor of the fairy palace, which was as huge as a plaza, was completely inlaid with the priceless emperor vigor stones. It did seem extremely exaggerated.</p>

  <p>A hint of a smile flashed onto Zheng's face as he watched Livingston's crazed performance while the puppet continued to admire the stones. It seemed that Luo Zheng had found a knowledgeable fellow this time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had known that the fairy palace was extraordinary, but he hadn't truly noticed the floor and walls before. He would also never have thought that the materials needed to build the fairy palace would be so rare. It gave him quite a shock to discover this.</p>

  <p>Just then, Saul appeared. He greeted Luo Zheng with a slight bow. Then he smiled warmly and said, "Master, you've returned."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had previously obtained three tokens and had acknowledged the first master of the fairy palace as his master, so he was now considered to be a half-master of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could reply to Saul's greeting, Livingston rushed forwards.</p>

  <p>"Are you a puppet?" Livingston crawled all over Saul as he looked him up and down, sometimes tapping on Saul's legs and sometimes tapping on his chest. "You are really a puppet! Heavens! I didn't ever believe it possible for someone to be able to make such a perfect puppet!"</p>

  <p>Livingston was very proud of his skills in weapon refining, but he didn't hold a candle to the creator of Saul.</p>

  <p>Although the puppet that Livingston had made for himself was ugly, it contained an incomparably perfect Life Law within it. This was also the reason why his soul had been able to live until now without withering over time.</p>

  <p>In Livingston's eyes, except for him, there had probably never been anyone else in the world who could achieve such a remarkable accomplishment.</p>

  <p>However, now that he saw Saul's puppet body, Livingston finally understood what it meant to have met his match, or perhaps his peer. His own puppet body was simply insignificant when compared to Saul's.</p>

  <p>Saul looked at Livingston and said with an indifferent expression, "Don't touch me so randomly."</p>

  <p>Livingston was deeply fascinated, and he was not willing to stop. How could he? Although he had stopped touching Saul, he still walked around the artificial body, conducting a visual inspection.</p>

  <p>Saul could only look at Luo Zheng for help in exasperation. He couldn't understand why Luo Zheng had brought this strange man here.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only shrug his shoulders helplessly and explain, "He is a weapon refiner. According to him, he was the best weapon refiner of the last round of heavens."</p>

  <p>"He has survived the end of the previous round of heavens?" Saul's indifferent facade showed a slight hint of surprise. Then he looked at Livingston and remarked, "It's not bad. With limited resources available, he was able to construct such a puppet body for himself. Although the appearance is a little crude and ugly, he has displayed the characteristics of these trashy materials to the limit."</p>

  <p>Saul's perfect puppet body was certainly not something that Livingston could compare to. The materials used in Saul's construction were unfathomable to Livingston, because he had never seen them before.</p>

  <p>Materials and technologies had changed greatly with the passage of time.</p>

  <p>Saul had lived for so many years, and he had followed his master for many years, so he had developed a good eye. He had taken a dislike to the materials from which Livingston was made. These trashy materials had produced an ugly and strange puppet body, which meant that Livingston must be a truly talented weapon refiner to have made something that lasted this long, while using scraps.</p>

  <p>"Trash?! You said I used trashy materials?"</p>

  <p>Livingston was unwilling to accept this. Back then, in order to obtain these materials, Osborn had gone out of his way. How could Saul say they were trash?</p>

  <p>However, on second thought, Livingston felt discouraged. Not wanting to dwell on the insults, he directed his attention back to the fairy palace instead.</p>

  <p>Light peace sand had been used to bake the bricks that were used to build the walls, and the emperor vigor stones were used to pave the floors.</p>

  <p>Livingston realized then that if he had been the owner of the fairy palace, he would also have thought that the materials he had used were trash, especially when compared to such opulence.</p>

  <p>Saul didn't ask Luo Zheng why he had returned to the fairy palace. He was merely a servant left behind by his master to serve Luo Zheng. He would do his best to help Luo Zheng in governing the fairy palace and settling into it.</p>

  <p>The purpose of Zheng's return to the fairy palace this time was to place Freya and Livingston in it.</p>

  <p>Freya was becoming more and more curious as she traveled along the walkways through the fairy palace. The fairy palace was not a place that she could easily understand, but she also understood now why Luo Zheng had been so confident before. It would be very difficult for outsiders to invade such a fairy palace, right? It was a magnificent place of mysteries and marvel.</p>

  <p>Livingston was at the back of the little group. Soon he had already become somewhat numb. In his eyes, every kind of material that had been used to build the fairy palace was a precious treasure. He couldn't wait to plunder the pavilions, the railings and the floor tiles. Livingston almost trembled at the thought of everything that he could make with this wealth of materials at his disposal.</p>

  <p>However, after seeing so much, he finally seemed to slump into a haze of befuddlement. Just as he passed by the pavilion in the center of the pond, his eyes became fixated in that direction.</p>

  <p>There were several passages connected to the pavilion, and each passage led to a different hall. Among them were the library, the pill refining workshop, and the weapon refining workshop--magical places all!</p>

  <p>"The weapon refining workshop!"</p>

  <p>Livingston recalled that Luo Zheng had said that he would help him settle down in a weapon refining workshop. Was this to be his workshop?</p>

  <p>As a puppet, Livingston didn't have a heart. If he had one, his heart would probably have started beating crazily at this very moment, at the mere sight of the weapon refining workshop.</p>

  <p>The fairy palace was amazing, so the weapon refining workshop definitely seemed to be extraordinary. There were a multitude of tools and materials carefully stored in the workshop, and Livingston eagerly feasted his eyes on the sight which tempted him so much.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, Livingston's pace quickened as he charged on his wobbly legs toward the weapon refining workshop, hoping to explore the hidden secrets within.</p>

  <p>Half way into the workshop, with a tremendous crash, Livingston hit a transparent enchanted barrier that had suddenly materialized. He hit the ground hard, sat up for a moment and then lay back on the ground, motionless.</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing this scene, Saul was left speechless. "Has he used up his life vitality crystals?" Earlier, Saul had noticed that the energy used to drive Livingston's puppet body was extremely inferior. He was actually driven by life vitality. If one wanted to control him, he or she would have to spend a massive amount of life vitality. It would be a costly exercise to keep the ancient puppet running.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled wryly at Saul. As he walked up to the Livingston, he heard Livingston's nearly inaudible cry. Then he once again took out life vitality jades, supported Livingston up into a sitting position, and slotted the life vitality jades into the groove on his back.</p>

  <p>Very soon, Livingston was able to move again. Immediately after he recovered, he said, "Why can't I go in the workshop?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. "The reason is simple. I don't have the right to enter it, so neither do you."</p>

  <p>"Ahh…"</p>

  <p>Livingston let out a miserable cry and leaned back against the invisible barrier. He eagerly looked at the workshop, which was just out of reach, wanting to open a hole on the door. "How can I get in?"</p>

  <p>"It depends on luck," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would definitely push his way through the True Path. After all, he only had three tokens with him. However, he wasn't too sure if he could obtain the token to open the weapon refining workshop, so he didn't make Livingston any promises.</p>

  <p>Livingston was very disappointed as there was clearly no hope for him to enter the workshop. He clambered to his feet to follow Luo Zheng in leaving, but turned to look back repeatedly with every reluctant step. He kept saying, "It depends on luck? What kind of luck will it take to open the workshop?"</p>

  <p>Saul, who was leading the way, calmly said, "With your lowly weapon refining skills, even if you manage to open the workshop, you still won't be qualified to control it!"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>Livingston, after years of believing that he was the best weapon refiner, was not convinced by Saul's doubt.</p>

  <p>People could doubt everything about him, like his life, but he absolutely would not allow them to doubt his weapon refining skills. He had intentionally turned himself into an ugly puppet just to survive in the world and study his refining skills. How could people doubt him without even knowing all that he had survived?</p>

  <p>Saul smiled faintly. He pointed at the library and said in a conciliatory tone, "My master's library contains a myriad of things, including many books on weapon refining. You are free to read them."</p>
