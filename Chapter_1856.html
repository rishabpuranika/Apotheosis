  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng's steps were as light as they had never been before.</p>

  <p>When he first entered the territory of the Collapsing Mountain race with Han Liusu, he was incomparably shocked, seeing the Collapsing Mountain people moving freely on the giant silver boulders.</p>

  <p>With his half a year of experience in this place and after absorbing the strength source, the gravitational force had become nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p>

  <p>Having lived on the Sacred Spring Mountain for many years, the monstrous badgers had absorbed quite a bit of strength source.</p>

  <p>Three monstrous badgers as large as barbarian cows pounced on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The power within them was by no means small? even Teigan couldn't help but take a few steps back upon witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>He had placed all his hopes on Luo Luo Zheng. While he wasn't certain about Luo Zheng's strength since the latter had only been in the Collapsing Mountain race for a short time, he had still absorbed so much strength source.</p>

  <p>After shifting his posture, Luo Luo Zheng took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Sacred Spring Mountain, his every move was incomparably clumsy. It was difficult for him to cross over a distance of twenty to thirty feet? it was like he had fallen into some invisible quagmire.</p>

  <p>Now, the gravitational force had no effect on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His punches were unbelievably fast.</p>

  <p>Pop, pop, pop!</p>

  <p>Each the size of a raging bull, the three badgers froze midair before bursting apart. Their skin, flesh, and bones were busted until finally, they dissolved into blood and fell to the ground before Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These badgers were considered to be at the top of the food chain at the bottom of the mountain. Once, they had surrounded and captured the Collapsing Mountain people, including even some warriors from other clans. But never had they thought a human's strength could be so terrifying.</p>

  <p>As they wailed in agony, the rest of the monstrous badgers dispersed.</p>

  <p>How could they stay and face Luo Luo Zheng after that?</p>

  <p>"Impressive?"</p>

  <p>Teigan took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Thinking of how Luo Luo Zheng was treated in the Collapsing Mountain race, Teigan wasn't initially convinced of Luo Zheng's strength. And it wasn't just him, even the other warriors and clansmen weren't accepting it.</p>

  <p>As far as they were concerned, Luo Luo Zheng was merely relying on his natural talent, being unafraid of fire, to swindle resources from the Collapsing Mountain race. Whether or not he could really help the Collapsing Mountain race was a big question mark.</p>

  <p>But now, Teigan saw it with his own eyes? he was truly convinced that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the same as the other foreign warriors.</p>

  <p>Rubbing his fists and curling the corner of his mouth, Luo Luo Zheng called him over. "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>With a nod, Teigan followed him.</p>

  <p>The huge cave sloped upward. Along the way, Luo Luo Zheng encountered a few strange beasts.</p>

  <p>But according to Teigan, these strange beasts weren't particularly powerful. They could actually be considered lucky.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the ground rose as they reached the middle of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Many holes suddenly appeared in the surrounding area, all of which were connected to the densely packed caves at the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>Regardless of which path was chosen, one would eventually come out of the hole and leave.</p>

  <p>Many warriors tossed and turned in the Sacred Spring Mountain. Finally, they had managed to absorb a considerable amount of strength source.</p>

  <p>Then, they all left and gathered with Luo Zheng's group.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes of walking, the road ahead of them grew brighter until a huge mountain pass finally came into view.</p>

  <p>At the entrance, Chapman stood with his arms crossed. Behind him were numerous Collapsing Mountain people? all of them had been waiting a long time.</p>

  <p>Warriors who could leave the mountain safely were able to pass the Collapsing Mountain race's coming-of-age ceremony which signified one's maturity.</p>

  <p>"How was your journey?"</p>

  <p>Every year, there'd be some warriors who had a great harvest. But the luckiest warriors were those of the Collapsing Mountain race. Unless they encountered an especially lucky chance, warriors of other races would have poor harvests.</p>

  <p>This time, Chapman was feeling concerned about an outsider.</p>

  <p>The place he was bringing Luo Luo Zheng to was all too dangerous. So he could only hope that Luo Luo Zheng would grow as much as he could.</p>

  <p>"Not bad," Luo Luo Zheng faintly nodded.</p>

  <p>Originally, Teigan wanted to inform others of the secrets they found in the cave. But on the way, Luo Luo Zheng had quietly warned him of some sort of magical power from within the cave. It was probably controlled by some kind of creature that wanted the secrets to remain hidden.</p>

  <p>There was an itch in Teigan's heart, but he knew that Luo Luo Zheng had a point.</p>

  <p>The Eight-diagram Ball was eventually returned to the original spot? if he just casually revealed such a secret, would it bring great trouble to the Collapsing Mountain race? So Teigan decided to hold it in.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could give Chapman a reply, a Collapsing Mountain warrior suddenly laughed out loud. "Haha! Uncle Chapman! I soaked in a pool of strength source!"</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Chapman's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"The pool of strength source suddenly began raining down on me. Even I was stunned! But in the end, I could only absorb a small part of it?"</p>

  <p>The rest of the race merely sighed.</p>

  <p>"A pool of the strength source is being poured? That's because the gravitational force of the strength source has been flipped over! This..."</p>

  <p>Something seemed to dawn on him, and Chapman looked excited. Such a situation rarely happened in the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>"What's so amazing about that? A small stream just poured over me in my journey. There was so much strength source I couldn't digest?" A warrior of another race sneered.</p>

  <p>In truth, as they walked forward, they weren't able to interact with each other.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, everyone thought they had chanced upon a fortuitous encounter. But after all their interactions, they realized that everyone seemed to have similar experiences. Only few warriors hadn't discovered the strength source and they could only beat breasts and wail about missing out on the god-sent opportunity.</p>

  <p>After hearing everyone's chatter, Chapman finally understood what was happening at the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>It was as if after they stepped into the mountain, the gravitational force was greatly disturbed, causing many warriors to get tossed about. Also, because of this, the strength source that was too far out of reach had suddenly been poured down.</p>

  <p>In the past, only a few warriors could obtain such a lucky chance. But this time, it was so common that most of the warriors had discovered the strength source.</p>

  <p>Many of those who had gone through the coming-of-age ceremony before and those who hadn't yet gotten the chance to participate had envy growing in their eyes.</p>

  <p>The strength source was all too important for body refiners. It often determined the limits of their future growth. The warriors who had entered the Sacred Spring Mountain this year were truly lucky, but none of them were aware that it was all Luo Zheng's doing.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, everyone's harvest is looking good. How about you?" Chapman sounded concerned about the man.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng merely nodded. "My luck wasn't so bad. I managed to absorb some of the strength source."</p>

  <p>"Like how much?" Chapman pursued the matter.</p>

  <p>"I've absorbed to the limit of my body's capacity, but there's still quite a bit that I haven't taken, so it's a waste," Luo Luo Zheng replied regretfully.</p>

  <p>The answer he gave prevented Chapman from questioning him further.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Luo Luo Zheng had absorbed until his limit, but he had managed to break through the inner world, directly turning the strength source into nine stars and placing them inside. There was still much that had failed to be absorbed, but Chapman had no clue that Luo Luo Zheng was regretful about the entire lake full of strength source. Even if a True God submerged in it, they probably wouldn't be able to absorb it completely.</p>

  <p>"Very good! Everyone, you've received the favor of the Sacred Spring Mountain. Follow me!" With an understanding nod, Chapman called everyone over.</p>

  <p>After passing the Sacred Spring Mountain, many warriors had to undergo the Collapsing Mountain race test. After that, if the warriors from other races wanted to continue their cultivation here, they could choose to join the Collapsing Mountain race to go hunting. Of course, they could also choose to leave the race on their own.</p>

  <p>According to the results of the test, the Collapsing Mountain race would put the warriors into different teams. As they were out to face powerful strange beasts, during the division of labor, everyone's strength was fully taken into account.</p>

  <p>Under Chapman's lead, all the warriors began moving, returning to the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>On the giant square stood a massive golden rock about ten feet high.</p>

  <p>Under the light, it emitted a dazzling golden splendor as if it was pure gold.</p>

  <p>It was even more solid and heavier than the silver rocks on the grounds within Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>"They're back, Princess Royal," Kennan said as he watched the troops from a distance.</p>

  <p>In this Sacred Spring Mountain test, Han Liusu wasn't qualified to participate. Though she could stand up, it took everything for her to merely stagger forward? one could imagine how upset she was.</p>

  <p>"Has Luo Luo Zheng returned?" Han Liusu asked. She was well aware of the death rate in the Sacred Spring Mountain. Usually, some unlucky individuals failed to return. Of course, she didn't want Luo Luo Zheng to be such an unlucky warrior.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's there," Kennan replied. "The kid has safely passed the Sacred Spring Mountain's test?I wonder how far he'll manage to push the stone in the next test."</p>
