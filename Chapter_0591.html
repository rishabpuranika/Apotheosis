<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 591 The Treasure Box Flew Away (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>She instead concentrated on controlling the flood dragon puppet and carefully searched above the Sea of Raging Fire.</p>

  <p>"There it is!" Tia suddenly exclaimed excitedly. They saw an island in the Sea of Raging Fire. It was totally deserted and there wasn't any path to it.</p>

  <p>There was also a huge blood-red enchanted barrier outside it, which covered the whole island.</p>

  <p>"Get down," Tia said, then she drove the flood dragon puppet down.</p>

  <p>When the flood dragon puppet got close to the blood-red enchanted barrier, a huge hole suddenly appeared in the barrier and the flood dragon puppet went inside.</p>

  <p>There were many buildings on the island. In front of the gate was a huge square. A huge black column stood in the center of the square.</p>

  <p>When Tia saw that Luo Luo Zheng was confused probably by the presence of the black column, she drove the huge flood dragon's body and made it twist around the column. After many rounds, the head of the flood dragon finally landed on the ground and at the same time, its mouth opened.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng carefully walked outside the flood dragon's body and raised his head to observe the column. 'If the huge flood dragon directly lands on the ground, it will need a large area. It is really smart to let the dragon's body twist around the column. It spares much room and is also convenient.</p>

  <p>How smart of the Blood Fiend Emperor!' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>A large main hall stood behind the huge square. There was a tablet on the hall with three words "Blood Fiend Hall" inscribed on it. It looked like it was the original home of the Blood Fiend Emperor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tia also walked out of the dragon's body with the crystal key in her hand. She went to the platform at the center of the square first instead of the Blood Fiend Hall. The feather of the Ice Phoenix trailed on the ground behind her, and Luo Luo Zheng followed.</p>

  <p>There was a crystal cube on the small platform that measured two feet long on each side. The inside of the cube seemed to lack a small piece that was needed to form a groove.</p>

  <p>Tia looked around the small platform and stared at Luo Luo Zheng, then said, "You'd better get close to the platform."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still asked even though he got closer to the platform.</p>

  <p>Tia didn't answer his question but put the crystal key into the groove of the cube instead.</p>

  <p>The moment Tia had inserted the key, the ground started to shake as if there was an earthquake. The whole square shook and trembled.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng saw that numerous light spots appeared. It was not from the sun, because there wasn't the sun in this space at all. The light spots on the square should be some special runes.</p>

  <p>Some of the runes were big and some of them were small. Some were shaped like the petals of a huge flower, while others were like rotating gears. Their shapes and sizes varied from one another.</p>

  <p>The one common thing about the runes was that they all started to rotate in the same direction. A slim, long, line of light appeared from each of the runes as they rotated at a certain speed. Then, the light flew in all directions.</p>

  <p>The lines looked like pieces of an arc that were meant to connect all the places inside the trial. What Luo Luo Zheng didn't know was that one of the lines had flown to the hidden trial inside the Sea of Raging Fire, where Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the silver treasure box.</p>

  <p>When the light line rushed toward the hidden trial, Lennon was down on the second platform. He was burned black all over. If one didn't look carefully, nobody could tell that it was a human.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the valley, all the other disciples from Cloud Hall had left.</p>

  <p>Lennon was the last one who jumped on the platform. He wanted to be well-prepared for it, so he got delayed until the last minute.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Luo Zheng and Lewis, Lennon had also obtained the red treasure box on the first platform. It clearly cost him a great amount of life vitality and strength, so he chose to rest and recover first. He chose to meditate and recuperate until he was in the best condition since the hidden trial had no time limit.</p>

  <p>After quite a while, Lennon stood up and confidently jumped on the second platform. He mentally thought about the guy at the third grade of the nature level who managed to get the silver box. He could easily do that since he was the top disciple of Cloud Hall. It would be ridiculous if he could not!</p>

  <p>He faced the flame and fireball, and tried his best with gritted teeth. In the end, he had survived!</p>

  <p>Lennon was completely exhausted after he had passed the trial on the second platform. He was severely burned. He successfully passed the trial because of the temptation of the blue box in front of him.</p>

  <p>As long as he had the blood vigor of the nine-headed dragon, he could obtain huge power and his body could recover in a short time!</p>

  <p>However, he was too badly hurt that he couldn't walk anymore. Thus, he crawled forward slowly. Even if the blue box was ten feet away from him, it seemed so far away like the end of the world.</p>

  <p>Still, Lennon pushed himself. "It doesn't matter! It will be worth it to obtain the blood vigor of the nine-headed dragon!" he encouraged himself with gritted teeth. With great pain and a whole lot of effort, he had almost touched the blue treasure box.</p>

  <p>Just before he offered his hand, a light line suddenly shot towards the blue box and covered it.</p>

  <p>Then, the blue box turned around and raised itself. It flew away and followed the light line.</p>

  <p>'What? It is flying away?' Lennon asked himself in shock. Stunned and dumbfounded, he stared at the flying blue treasure box.</p>
