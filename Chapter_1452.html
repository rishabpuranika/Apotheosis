<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors, including the ogres, humans, and the Demon Night members, stared at Luo Zheng with dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"The seed of the World Tree has been swallowed by him!"</p>

  <p>"Can we get it back by cutting open his stomach?"</p>

  <p>"That is impossible. Once an Elixir Field Treasure is devoured, it enters the warrior's inner world. If we kill him, the inner world will collapse as well, and then everything within will be annihilated!"</p>

  <p>"Then we can do nothing about it."</p>

  <p>Once an Elixir Field Treasure was devoured, not even the person who had swallowed it could take it out, let alone someone else.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was floating at the top of the cave, had not moved an inch.</p>

  <p>From what Xun had told him, it would be best if he rested for a moment after swallowing the World Tree's seed, so that it could sink safely into the sea of chaos in his belly.</p>

  <p>As for the other warriors in the cave, their gazes reflected their desire to kill Luo Zheng, but he turned a blind eye to them.</p>

  <p>While everyone was deep in discussion, the ogre warrior smiled widely.</p>

  <p>His smile was ferocious. Anyone could see that the ogre wished to devour Luo Zheng in one go.</p>

  <p>"Kid, I already warned you before. If you dare to swallow the seed, this underground palace becomes your grave!"</p>

  <p>The platform across the cave was small. But as the ogre warrior released his Mu Ning, the other warriors began to retreat.</p>

  <p>"He has the Ancient Evil Ape bloodline!"</p>

  <p>"That bloodline is very pure."</p>

  <p>"Once that human brat comes down, we will work together to attack him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the World Tree's seed hasn't entered his elixir field yet."</p>

  <p>Zheng's previous performance had made the warriors of the three tenth-grade sacred places wary of him. But when the ogre warrior who had activated the Ancient Evil Ape bloodline took the lead, the others responded in unison.</p>

  <p>If they killed Luo Zheng, there might still be a sliver of a chance to win over the World Tree's seed. If they did not act now, that chance would cease to exist.</p>

  <p>Under this increasing greed, the warriors would easily lose their heads.</p>

  <p>After all, obtaining a World Tree's seed meant that their future paths would expand and their destinies would become full of countless possibilities. In addition to that, no one wished to live in their barren supreme world forever.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the Demon Night warriors were much more reserved.</p>

  <p>The blonde-haired woman of the race pulled her people into a corner.</p>

  <p>Although she was disappointed that Luo Zheng had obtained the World Tree's seed, he had done so with his own strength. Other than Luo Zheng, no one saw through the true trajectory of the gusts of wind.</p>

  <p>The woman was puzzled. How did Luo Zheng manage to find the correct way in so many gusts of wind?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng floated at the top of the cave, quietly watching the crowd of warriors. His eyes were calm as he waited in silence. After about five minutes, he sensed a strange feeling come from his elixir field.</p>

  <p>When the World Tree's seed sank into the chaotic sea, Luo Zheng could no longer sense its existence.</p>

  <p>The seed sank slowly in the sea of chaos. Eventually, it reached the bottom. As it did so, the originally smooth seed revealed tiny, slender tentacles. As the tentacles extended out, they quickly took root in Zheng's elixir field.</p>

  <p>Once the World Tree's seed took root, he felt its existence again. In a sense, the seed had already become a part of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"All right, it's done." The corner of Zheng's mouth curled up slightly as a faint malicious Mu Ning surfaced in his previously calm eyes.</p>

  <p>The spiraling gusts of wind originally maintained a delicate balance. As Luo Zheng leaned forward slightly, his body glided forward and was soon sucked into a gust of wind, flying toward the other side of the cave.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng flying downward, the ogre warrior with the Ancient Evil Ape bloodline roared aloud. At the same time, he took out a giant hammer from his Sumeru Space. The hammer glinted with dark golden light.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, both of his eyes turned red. The Ancient Evil Ape's Mu Ning that surged from his body was incomparably formidable. Even Freya, who stood far away from him, had a deathly pallor under the pressure of the Mu Ning. Lincoln, on the other hand, had a cautious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>He knew that the moment Luo Zheng descended, he would face a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior was planning to use his dark golden hammer to smash Luo Zheng into a pulp the instant he descended.</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone present, Luo Zheng flew along the gusts of wind and landed on the ground. With an indifferent smile on his face, he leisurely took out a sword from his space ring.</p>

  <p>"Thunder Wind Divine Sword! This boy is from Mist Palace!"</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng took out the sword, the human Saint Lord's face became grave.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Magnolia Sacred Place immediately saw through the origins of the sword in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>From the start, the Saint Lord had suspected Zheng's and Lincoln's origins.</p>

  <p>As per common sense, with such strength at their cultivation levels, they must have had a powerful background in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord had planned to engage in a talk with Luo Zheng and Lincoln once they left the underground palace. If the two of them were truly independent warriors, he would have liked to invite them to the Magnolia Sacred Place. However, the strength that Luo Zheng displayed caused the Saint Lord to be certain that his origins were not so simple.</p>

  <p>His deduction was turning out to be true.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng revealed his Thunder Wind Divine Sword, the human Saint Lord recognized it.</p>

  <p>"The sword used to belong to Kyron Xiao. There is only one possibility, and it's that this boy comes from Mist Palace. It isn't strange for him to show such strength." The human Saint Lord sighed, a hint of disappointment appearing on his face.</p>

  <p>He could see through the origins of the sword. However, the other warriors in the underground palace could only see the grade of this sword.</p>

  <p>"A first-rank divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>"It is indeed a first-rank divine weapon. How did this rascal come to possess such a treasure?"</p>

  <p>"As the saying goes, never reveal your wealth! You are only at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm, yet you dare to use a first-rank divine weapon to brag about your possessions. Hah! It is not that we want to kill you; it is you who seek death!" the ogre warrior taunted Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The rest of them had been waiting for the ogre warrior to make his move, so they could follow after him. When they saw the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, the greed in their eyes strengthened.</p>

  <p>The Dark World was much inferior to other supreme worlds in terms of resources. These warriors were young talents of various sacred places.</p>

  <p>The resources they had access to were far inferior to those that the warriors of the thirteen palaces possessed. For the warriors of the thirteen palaces, this first-rank divine weapon was of course extraordinary, but to the Dark World warriors, it was a fantasy coming true. It was much like the World Tree's seed that Luo Zheng had swallowed.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng took out his sword, he flew over at a fast speed. The ogre warrior with the Ancient Evil Ape bloodline raised his dark golden hammer.</p>

  <p>An earthen yellow light gathered on the giant hammer, causing the ogre warrior's Mu Ning to become several times more intense. Once again, he roared loudly, "Earth, go berserk! Tear apart the sky!"</p>

  <p>Normally, most ogre warriors focused on refining their bodies. This particular ogre warrior's body was not inferior to those of the ogre body refiners, and he also specialized in the Earth Law. With the two different kinds of cultivating systems, the power of his hammer strike was much more forceful.</p>

  <p>As the other warriors witnessed the ogre warrior's full attack, they could not help but widen their eyes. The hammer strike could smash Luo Zheng and his sword into a pulp. Although Zheng's sword was a first-rank divine weapon, the sword blade itself was not too thick. It could easily be bent or broken.</p>

  <p>Freya looked at Luo Zheng, her heart racing with worry. However, when she saw the smile on his face, an inexplicable confidence rose in her heart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng certainly knew how to deal with this.</p>

  <p>The moment the ogre warrior swung his hammer, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in Zheng's hand charged at his opponent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not choose to dodge the ogre warrior's attack; rather, he faced him head on as he wielded his sword.</p>
