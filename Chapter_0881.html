  <p>It was the first time Luo Luo Zheng had encountered a second-level war lord after becoming a war general.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, Cheryl and the other Demon Night members, as well as Olivia and the other human warriors were not overly concerned about him.</p>

  <p>Back then when Luo Luo Zheng was only a level ten war fighter, he had already successfully defeated Boris who happened to be a level ten war general. It was well-known to everyone that Boris possessed powerful abilities that enabled him to be considered as the strongest divine-level talent in the two sacred places of the ogre. The early-stage war lord might not be a match for Boris.</p>

  <p>At the present, the orc war lord seemed to be impatient. As soon as he finished speaking, he grunted while lifting the two huge axes from his back, and rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, all of the orcs were short in stature, and the orc war lord in front of Luo Luo Zheng was not even tall enough to reach Luo Zheng's chest. However, what they lacked in height was made up in other aspects. The bodies of the orcs were sturdy, and their blood energy was far stronger than other races.</p>

  <p>For the orcs, injuries and fatal wounds were nothing to worry about, as their healing abilities were much stronger than other races.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the orc war lord charging towards where he stood, Luo Luo Zheng sported an apathetic expression on his face as he pulled out a long sword from his space ring.</p>

  <p>The moment the spectators observed the scene, they were immediately stunned by the appearance of the long sword in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"This guy has changed his weapon again?" a member of the audience asked.</p>

  <p>"His previous long sword is at the low-grade of sacred level, right? His current sword?"</p>

  <p>"It is a top-grade weapon! It's a long sword at the top-grade of sacred level," one of them mused before continuing. "That guy must be very wealthy to possess something like that?"</p>

  <p>In reality, a top-grade sacred weapon was rare indeed even in the sacred place.</p>

  <p>As a supreme master of the Demon Night, Amber would not lie to Xun. The long sword that Luo Luo Zheng had and the weapon that Amber used were the only two top-grade sacred weapons left in the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Across the Sea God Continent, only the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place respectively possessed one top-grade sacred weapon. Furthermore, there were only two top-grade sacred weapons in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. As for the Purple Heart Sacred Place, although there existed only a few middle-grade sacred weapons, there was not a single top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>As the orc war lord dashed forward and prepared to strike, the forceful energy within his body exploded forth, emitting a vibrant black light. The sound of a beast-like roar reverberated throughout the walls as the orc attacked.</p>

  <p>The axe in his hand shot out from his grasp and circled high in the air, leaving a visible arc before it directly struck towards Luo Luo Zheng as his back was turned.</p>

  <p>All the while, the orc war lord was also firmly holding a battle axe in his hand as he remained in front of Luo Luo Zheng and swung it at him in full force.</p>

  <p>What his opponent had intended to do was to attack Luo Luo Zheng simultaneously from the front and from the back. The might of the battle axes were formidable and powerful, so if Luo Luo Zheng were not careful enough, he might be chopped into two.</p>

  <p>For the meantime, Luo Luo Zheng was still eerily calm. Despite the sword in his hand, he did not bother using it to defend himself, but instead made a backward somersault above the air. As if he had somehow activated a second pair of eyes behind him, he accurately dodged the axe which flew towards his back and kicked it out of the way.</p>

  <p>Right after, the spiraling battle axe was now spinning faster than it had been a moment ago. This time, its momentum led itself towards the incoming orc war lord.</p>

  <p>Without much preamble, the orc war lord grinned hideously and then caught the battle axe with his hand, like he had planned to do so all along.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to land on the ground after his flip, the war lord's forceful energy erupted a second time and started to rapidly approach the young man again.</p>

  <p>"Savage Slash!"</p>

  <p>With a shout, the gigantic axe swung out a beam of scarlet-gold light, tearing through Luo Zheng's shadow and intending to disintegrate it into fragments. As he did so, the orc war lord laughed maniacally and roared out, "Break into pieces for me! You cannot withstand a single blow!"</p>

  <p>In actuality, this was the usual case for the orcs. Once they started to feel the thrill of a good fight, they became extremely out of control!</p>

  <p>Within a mere moment, the orc war lord unleashed dozens of strikes, all deliberately done to inflict harm on the warrior. When he stopped to gasp for breath from the effort it took to land all those attacks, he looked up and dumb-foundedly discovered that Luo Luo Zheng was standing not far away. There was not a single scratch on him as he stood there safe and sound, staring back at the orc with amusement dancing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>As expected, this was the power of the Space Law. No matter how powerful one's bodily movement skills were, they could never compare to something like this!</p>

  <p>"It seems like Luo Luo Zheng is not weak at all!" one of the creatures mused, amazed at the display of Luo Zheng's Space Law.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that even an average middle-stage war lord may not be able to defeat Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>In response, another audience expressed his opinion, "In that case, the only ones who can probably suppress Luo Luo Zheng in the Tower of Sin are the top-level war lords!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, many of the creatures in the Tower of Sin thought highly of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Luo Zheng was just a first-level war general that had accomplished great things thus far. One of the main reasons as to why Luo Luo Zheng could resist the second-level war lord was that this particular war lord was merely an independent warrior, not from the orc sacred place.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, many independent warriors were much stronger than those who came from various sects. This was due to the fact that independent warriors' strength grew more and more powerful and ultimately greater by totally relying on their own abilities. Although the sect warriors did possess some sort of sect inheritance, their battle experience was significantly inferior to the proficiency of independent warriors in that area.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, in the Sea God Continent, when it came to sacred places, the inheritance one might get was more important than battle experience.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, most of the warriors of the Sea God Continent had climbed up in the Tower of Sin after defeating numerous warriors from all kinds of races. Even the warriors from sacred places did not lack combat experience, so the independent warriors of the continent were substandard when compared to the geniuses of the sacred places.</p>
