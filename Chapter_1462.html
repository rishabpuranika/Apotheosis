  <p>
</p>

  <p>The number one weapon refiner in the universe. What an awe-inspiring reputation.</p>

  <p>These juniors were ignorant and ill-informed, and never had heard of the name of Livingston, but they were greatly shocked.</p>

  <p>The puppet was furious, but he turned his nose up in the air.</p>

  <p>Many of the martial artists stared at him in a daze, including Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The number one weapon refiner in the universe?"</p>

  <p>"Don't give yourself airs. What I see before me is just a lousy puppet.</p>

  <p>How dare you claim to be the number one weapon refiner?"</p>

  <p>"It's known to all that among all clans in the universe, the number one weapon refiner is Delroy Xu from the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>Weapon refiners played a significant role in the world of martial artists.</p>

  <p>The sacred places of all the races had their own weapon refiners, but first-class refiners were apparently rare. The Universe Spirit Tablet was often modified because of the existence of these refiners.</p>

  <p>The title 'number one weapon refiner of the universe' fell like thunder upon the ears of most martial artists.</p>

  <p>There was no question that the number one weapon refiner of the universe was Delroy Xu. No one dared to doubt that. The reason for it was obvious. The supreme divine weapons ranked from one to ten on the Spirit Tablet had all been refined by Delroy alone.</p>

  <p>They were all puzzled about this puppet and could hardly believe him when he said that he was the number one weapon refiner in the universe.</p>

  <p>"I'm not boasting! I am Livingston! Go and ask your elders. I..."</p>

  <p>Livingston exclaimed dramatically, waving his arms about. However, as he spoke, his voice became softer and softer. After a while, he was no longer able to move at all and his voice once again became inaudible.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the life vitality jade that Luo Zheng gave him was completely used up now.</p>

  <p>"The puppet is fascinating. I will bring him to Magnolia Sacred Place to study him." A human martial artist smiled as he stepped forward, holding ten life vitality jades in his hands. He wanted to supplement the jades for the puppet.</p>

  <p>He was clever. The puppet might have been found and unearthed by Luo Zheng, but it seemed that he had his own thoughts. Thus, he could be classified as a living being.</p>

  <p>This way, it was up to the puppet to decide whom he wanted to follow.</p>

  <p>The human martial artist handed over ten life vitality jades to Livingston, trying to please him. If he persuaded the puppet to leave with him, Luo Zheng would presumably not stop him.</p>

  <p>However, he had only taken a few steps when one of his legs got stuck to the ground. He was unable to move any farther. Luo Zheng stared at the human martial artist indifferently. Although there was no killing intent in his gaze, the human martial artist did not dare to act rashly. After all, he did not wish for death.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then smiled faintly. He once again took out dozens of life vitality jades and stuffed them into the groove on the puppet's back.</p>

  <p>Very quickly, the puppet returned to life, brimming with energy. "Go back and ask your elders. You will know that I am..."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to know who you are," Luo Zheng interrupted him abruptly.</p>

  <p>Livingston stared at Luo Zheng in a daze. "So you claim to be the number one weapon refiner in the universe," Luo Zheng continued. "You must know how to refine weapons very well."</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Livingston pointed to the divine weapons that were piled high on the ground. "I refined all of them. They are all my works… But what's wrong with them?" He finally managed to say a few words normally, but then he started to turn abnormal once again. The puppet cried out in grief and indignation, "Why? Why have they all died?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyelids quivered. He felt like he had met a madman.</p>

  <p>On the ground were just a bunch of inanimate divine weapons. Why was Livingston saying that they were dead?</p>

  <p>Livingston walked over and knelt on top of the pile of ancient treasures clumsily. He took some of the ancient treasures in his hands, looking comically upset.</p>

  <p>"He really is a madman," said Xun.</p>

  <p>But the cyan dragon disagreed on this. "No. He's not mad."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes glinted before he asked, "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I am not obsessed with weapon refining, but my fourth brother is talented at weapon refining in the Genuine Dragon race," said the cyan dragon softly.</p>

  <p>So far, among the nine dragons, only two had been awakened. The cyan dragon's fourth brother was the fourth oldest dragon among the nine dragons. He was the green dragon.</p>

  <p>According to what the cyan dragon just said, his fourth brother was a good hand at weapon refining. The Genuine Dragon race was not generally good at weapon refining. After all, super legendary beasts did not value weapons very much, so their refiners were incomparable to the human ones.</p>

  <p>"Although my fourth brother's attainments in weapon refining were not profound, he was always engrossed in the work. Every time he spoke of it, he insisted that the divine weapons he refined had their own souls.</p>

  <p>They were like living things created by him, meant to continue his bloodline," the cyan dragon continued.</p>

  <p>It was hard to believe that Livingston was the number one weapon refiner in the universe, but the cyan dragon believed that he showed special preference to weapon refining.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Livingston was heartbroken. He grabbed one of the short swords and said in a low voice, "This one is just a second-rank divine weapon. Back then, I had poured heavenly essence into it and used divine textures to stabilize it. The heavenly essence would slowly fade away, but its speed should be much slower than that in normal divine weapons. It should have taken at least three hundred million years for it to completely ebb away. But now, I see the heavenly essence has completely disappeared. How many years have passed?"</p>

  <p>Three hundred million years?</p>

  <p>"My word! What a long time!"</p>

  <p>"Three hundred million years! Do the Supreme Lords have such a long lifespan?"</p>

  <p>"I heard that they do. Their sense of time is completely different to that of common martial artists."</p>

  <p>Even to a martial artist with a long lifespan, the time span of three hundred million years was unimaginable.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng heard this, his eyes turned hard.</p>

  <p>This time span was just Livingston's speculation. The actual amount of time taken must have been far longer than what he had speculated.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord's origins were mystifying. Livingston considered himself to be the number one weapon refiner, but no one in the universe even knew of his name. No matter which way Luo Zheng thought of it, there was something odd about this.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, many years have passed. However, I just don't understand. If you are a weapon refiner, why did you become a puppet?" Luo Zheng asked him.</p>

  <p>"You have no idea," Livingston said, any warmth absent from his voice.</p>

  <p>"A weapon refiner is destined to be unable to go far on the path of martial arts. To me, the body is just a shell. I personally made the body of a puppet for myself. It was the only way for me to fully immerse myself in weapon refining, and at the same time acquire an even longer lifespan!"</p>

  <p>So, Livingston had turned himself into a puppet.</p>

  <p>He was truly a fanatical weapon refiner.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng thought of this, the corners of his mouth curled up. He knew of the weapon refining workshop in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The workshop was yet to open, but as Zheng's cultivation level increased, he would once again set foot in the True Path. By then, he would need Livingston's help after obtaining the token to open the workshop.</p>

  <p>It did not matter whether or not Livingston was the number one weapon refiner in the universe. If he was able to refine so many divine weapons, his refining skills and techniques must be extraordinary. He was also a puppet, which was a fact that appealed to Luo Zheng. If his origins had been different, or if he had been a refiner from a large clan, Luo Zheng would probably not have considered taking him to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng smiled. "Do you still want to refine weapons?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I was born to refine weapons. If I didn't refine weapons, I would have long been dead!" Livingston's voice rose to a crescendo once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not expect Livingston to be so excited at his proposal, so he was a bit speechless. "If that's the case, I know of a weapon workshop where you can put your superiority into full play."</p>

  <p>"A weapon workshop? Ha-ha!" Livingston sniffed arrogantly. "There is no refining workshop in the universe that could accommodate me." He paused for some seconds before continuing, "However, I can make do with it."</p>

  <p>Livingston changed his attitude abruptly. Because he was addicted to weapon refining, he could not be too picky about his place of work.</p>

  <p>However, he still had his pride. He turned up his noses at ordinary places.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not bother to waste more words with Livingston. He straightaway grabbed him and stuffed him into the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>Living beings could not exist in the Sumeru Space, but Livingston's soul was in the puppet, so he would have to stay in the spirit beast bag for the time being.</p>
