</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Fuxi dragged the Evil God like a soiled piece of rag that left a bloody trail on the ground.</p>

  <p>He pointed at Shera with a glare. "You and your ship get out of the Icy Snow Province. Now!"</p>

  <p>His harsh, unfriendly tone served as a warning to Shera that if she didn't heed his words, a fierce battle was bound to ensue.</p>

  <p>Shera willed herself to calm down, her eyes returning to normal as she relaxed. Fuxi, with his formidable strength, could've easily killed the Evil God with the tip of his finger but chose to only teach him a lesson instead.</p>

  <p>Shera knew he was going to be fine despite his dismal state.</p>

  <p>'Well, this isn't so bad, ' she thought to herself as she looked down at her beaten disciple.</p>

  <p>She was a soft-hearted woman who accepted the Evil God and his arrogant personality.</p>

  <p>However, his arrogance could get extreme at times and would only grow in the future. Shera hoped that Fuxi's lesson would serve to temper his insolence and strengthen his character.</p>

  <p>She walked towards the Evil God and threw a golden pill towards him. "Get up. We'll wait for you outside the Icy Snow Province."</p>

  <p>Then, she lifted the hem of her black dress and gave Fuxi a respectful bow.</p>

  <p>"It'll be hard for us to explain to our captain if there's anything wrong with him. Please hold yourself back, Human Sovereign."</p>

  <p>There was an edge to her tone, an evident warning. If the Evil God died in the Chaotic Source World then he would only have himself to blame.</p>

  <p>However, dying outside the Chaotic Source World was another thing entirely. Whoever attacked him would earn the wrath of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>After saying her piece, Shera departed by vanishing on the spot. At the same time, the Black Ship began to sail away serenely like a graceful spectre.</p>

  <p>Fuxi snorted, watching the Black Ship's departure with a frown. He lingered for a few moments before he too employed the Grand Teleportation technique and disappeared.</p>

  <p>At the next moment, he suddenly appeared on top of a snowy mountain where he could see the entirety of the Chaotic Source World. He picked up a wine jar from somewhere and took a healthy swig.</p>

  <p>Fuxi hated trouble. The only reason he stood with Li Shan mountain and maintained order in the Icy Snow Province was to beg for someone's forgiveness.</p>

  <p>The Evil God remained curled up on where he lay. He looked like a soiled rag wrung together to get rid of excess water. This humbling sight gave everyone a sort of pleasant feeling in their hearts.</p>

  <p>An arrogant man was never pitied by anyone, especially since that man also turned out to be the notorious Soul Devouring Demon.</p>

  <p>Many great races hated him right to the core!</p>

  <p>Grunting heavily, the Evil God forced himself to sit up and threw the golden pill Shera had left into his mouth. He then crossed his legs and closed his eyes as a sinister smile hung on the corner of his mouth.</p>

  <p>Shera fully believed that Fuxi could teach the Evil God a lesson, however, she was wrong. Even Luo Zheng, who had been the Evil God's creator, did not fully understand how his mind worked, so what more could she?</p>

  <p>The Evil God once dared to rebel against Luo Zheng when he was still in his creator's inner world.</p>

  <p>He perfectly understood Luo Zheng's significance to the entire inner world along with the fact that he was an invincible being, nevertheless, the Evil God commenced with the rebellion.</p>

  <p>To his misfortune, Luo Zheng was an omniscient and omnipotent being in his inner world.</p>

  <p>His avatar was only a minuscule part of his soul, and even if it was killed, that would scarcely even harm him, much less kill him.</p>

  <p>With this, the Evil God was driven to try harder. He was motivated by a primitive evil will that refused to make him compromise to anyone, even his creator.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already noticed the Evil God's intents back then and had wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>During that time though, Luo Zheng had just entered the divine land and had no time to take care of his inner world. He needed a powerful individual to help him manage his inner world and thus spared the Evil God's life.</p>

  <p>Initially, no sort of crisis occurred in his inner world as the Evil God chose to behave obediently. Even when living in seclusion, he left behind a system that maintained peace in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng didn't know was that the Evil God was merely restraining his evil will while he absorbed the power of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was extremely talented and grew his strength rapidly. He even managed to blend together a large number of Divine Dao and gained freedom from Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>In short, the Evil God was someone who never gave in to anyone.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's power may have been great but he was not an unbeatable enemy.</p>

  <p>If the Evil God refused to submit to his own creator, what more Fuxi?</p>

  <p>As he healed himself with the aid of the pill, a weird aura emanated from his body.</p>

  <p>Those who sensed his aura felt terribly annoyed by it. Even Phoenix and Qiu Yinhe, despite being powerful beings, couldn't resist the feeling of aggravation in their guts. It couldn't be explained in terms of physical strength or soul power. The Evil God was just born to be evil, as the enemy of the world.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, this person from your inner world... He is quite ...extraordinary,"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge remarked with disgust.</p>

  <p>The pill had done its work, healing most of the wounds on the Evil God's body.</p>

  <p>He was incredibly handsome for someone so evil, charming too if only the vileness he emanated didn't disgust Feng Ge that much.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but regret ever releasing this man from his inner world.</p>

  <p>He had made a strong enemy for himself that he now had no way of restraining.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, have you ever heard of an Inner-world Generating Avatar?" Dorothy suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>"A what? Inner-world Generating Avatar?" He turned to her with a confused look.</p>

  <p>"It's a special cultivation method that was quite popular a long time ago,"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe said.</p>

  <p>There were numerous creatures within a warrior's inner world. As always, elites would always sprout amongst these creatures, armed with peerless talents and endless potential.</p>

  <p>If a warrior trained these elite creatures separately, allowing them to grow and even taking them out of their inner worlds, then they could turn them into their avatars.</p>

  <p>"But these avatars have their own consciousness. They're their own person, right?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe nodded. "That's true. In fact, the Inner-world Generating Avatar is regarded as an evil skill. The Rebirth Land is used as a method to better cultivate and control an Inner-world Generating Avatar."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered his words for a bit. "I don't think many people create their avatars nowadays though. Why is that?"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe did mention that this skill was popular a long time ago but not anymore. That meant there was something probably wrong with it that rendered it unacceptable.</p>

  <p>"Because it's very difficult to control the avatars through the Rebirth Lands.</p>

  <p>Many secondary creatures betrayed their creators after leaving their inner worlds. They never gave their creators a chance to annihilate their consciousness at all," Qiu Yinhe explained.</p>

  <p>There were two steps in the creation of Inner-world Generating Avatars.</p>

  <p>The first would be to select the target creatures and build Rebirth Lands for them. The second would be to take them out of the inner world for training.</p>

  <p>After a certain amount of time, when the creatures were deemed ready, the creators would then erase their consciousness and turn them into avatars.</p>

  <p>Since they were born in their inner worlds, the creators would find no rejection at all when entering their avatars. They would feel like their own bodies. Avatars created this way were deemed the strongest.</p>
