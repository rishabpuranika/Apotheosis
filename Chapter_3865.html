<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3865 The Descending Man In Black </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The captain of the Black Ship, Shera, and the others also stared at the brass man, feeling quite confounded.</p>

  <p>The brass man shrugged his shoulders while carrying Luo Zheng to show that he had no understanding of the situation...</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God was unable to retrieve someone from a Holy Soul Realm warrior. Even Othniel's expression became quite unnatural.</p>

  <p>Othniel reached out his hand towards the brass man again, and the irregular power of space folded around Luo Zheng. However, when the power of space was applied to Luo Zheng, it vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had become like a black hole in the shape of his body. He could absorb all forms of power.</p>

  <p>After failing twice in a row, Othniel finally relented and quit. His figure flashed, and he came to the Invisible Ship. He glanced at the captain and then reached out his hand to grab hold of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The brass man looked at the captain in a mute appeal for help. Given the situation, if the captain did not make a move, the brass man would not take action either.</p>

  <p>As Othniel's hand grabbed out, the white fog created by the brass man's Combat Dragon Absorb began to thin and dissipate, and Luo Zheng was taken away by Othniel.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, Othniel glanced back at Edith and flippantly commented,</p>

  <p>"This space ship is very exquisite. It will make a fine tomb for you..."</p>

  <p>Once Othniel finished speaking, his figure disappeared, and he reappeared beside Xuanyuan still holding onto Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After they had left, Edith suddenly sensed trouble brewing and exclaimed in a state of panic, "Captain, I can't control the Invisible Ship..."</p>

  <p>The Invisible Ship was Edith's Other Shore Token, but now it was no longer under her control.</p>

  <p>"Your Other Shore Token is out of control?" Shera arched her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Yes..."</p>

  <p>Edith stared at the transparent Invisible Ship in horror. "The Invisible Ship is shrinking!"</p>

  <p>The Invisible Ship, which was thousands of feet in size, had steadily begun shrinking. In less than nine seconds, it had already shrunk by half. The people of the Black Ship, who were in the cabin, would soon be squashed by the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship used their Grand Teleportation technique at the same time, trying to teleport from the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>However, the instant they used this technique to escape, they were surprised, and their expressions filled with fear. There was no fluctuation in the space. It must be Othniel's ploy to have trapped them here using some skill.</p>

  <p>It would be a small feat for the Chaos Ancient God, who was in charge of the space truth, to trap them!</p>

  <p>"Captain!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>"We are trapped here!"</p>

  <p>While the crowd panicked, the Invisible Ship had shrunk to the size of ten feet, and there was only one shoulder width on the left side and the right side. Tomos from the Ear Mouse race and Shera could still fit in the small ship, but the ship was not large enough to accommodate the tall and strong brass man.</p>

  <p>The brass man stretched out his hands, trying to push the Invisible Ship outwards and stop it from shrinking more.</p>

  <p>However, he had used almost all of his strength, yet he couldn't stop the Invisible Ship's shrinking even an inch.</p>

  <p>The power which was shrinking the space was not something the brass man could oppose. The bones in his body creaked loudly, and his face turned cherry red.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>An explosive sound emanated from the brass man's chest, and the bones of his arms suddenly broke completely off!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, other members of the Black Ship, such as Shera and Edith, had also joined hands to stop the ship from shrinking. However, even though all the members of the Black Ship took action, the Invisible Ship continued shrinking at the original speed.</p>

  <p>After a short while, they could no longer even turn around. If the ship continued to shrink, they would all be squeezed to a pulp!</p>

  <p>Then Shera craned her neck to look at the captain. It would be too late if they didn't summon that man now.</p>

  <p>Just as Shera was becoming desperate, a golden circle of light suddenly appeared behind the captain. Within the golden circle of light stood a man in a black robe. The man had a pair of deep eyes, and their depths seemed to be filled with stories and secrets. The faint stubble on his chin hinted at an unruly character.</p>

  <p>"Do you need any help?"</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>He stretched out his feet and kicked up against the transparent wall of the Invisible Ship. It seemed unnervingly easy for him to do that. The ship shook violently and stopped shrinking.</p>

  <p>As the man began exerting his strength on the Invisible Ship, the unbreakable space barrier around the ship shattered into thousands of pieces with a bang.</p>

  <p>He gently hitched up his robe and flew upwards like a black goshawk. At the same time, a rumbling sound echoed from the sky. A terrifying energy quietly swept past and then disappeared without a trace. This was the punishment of truth that could not descend.</p>

  <p>Othniel didn't think the members of the Black Ship would ever escape. In his mind, it was inconceivable they would be able to escape from the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>After he had dealt with the Black Ship, there were only two targets of the Li Shan mountain remaining.</p>

  <p>Since he made his move, he would not let any of his targets escape.</p>

  <p>But moments after he left the ship, he felt a huge movement coming from behind him.</p>

  <p>Othniel turned around and saw the man in black. His cold eyes flashed a trace of seriousness.</p>

  <p>In the chaos, even the strongest Eternal Realm warrior couldn't oppose the Chaos Ancient Gods who controlled the truth. Therefore, even Fuxi and the Black Ship had not been taken seriously by Othniel. At least, Othniel felt that these Eternal Realm warriors posed no threat to him.</p>

  <p>However, the man in black who had now appeared made Othniel feel an instinctive vigilance. This vigilance only happened when he was facing other Chaos Ancient Gods. He didn't expect that he would have such a feeling when facing a mere human, and this left him feeling a little confused.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, who had been pulled here by Othniel, quietly exchanged nervous looks.</p>

  <p>Of course, they knew that the man in black had descended from the Other Shore and must be a member of the Nihility race. However, the members of the Nihility race always took mysterious and unpredictable actions, and they were unable to determine the man in black's identity.</p>

  <p>In fact, not long ago, the man in black had appeared in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. If Pearce had been present, he would have been able to recognize him.</p>

  <p>However, if the Nihility race could duel Othniel to the death, Fuxi and the others would celebrate seeing it.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked Othniel.</p>

  <p>The man in black sniffed the air, revealing some enjoyment on his face.</p>

  <p>"I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time. Even though more than a thousand chaotic eras have passed, the scent of this world still hasn't changed," the man in black said without answering Othniel's question. Othniel's face darkened, and he asked in a low voice, "Tell me who you are!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he suddenly lashed out at the man in black, and a crescent-shaped space crack hurtled straight towards the man in black. The space crack that the Chaos Ancient God had so casually created was extremely lethal.</p>

  <p>Facing the space crack, the man in black smiled faintly and extended his palm to block the crack as if swatting a fly.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>When the man's palm met the space crack, a grating noise sounded, and the space crack disintegrated.</p>

  <p>Then his lips formed a warm smile. "It doesn't matter who I am. The most important thing is that man. You have to hand him over to me," the man in black said, pointing at Luo Zheng, who was draped over Othniel's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Not in your wildest dreams," responded Othniel.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that Luo Zheng was able to absorb all the energy and couldn't be transported away, Othniel would have hidden Luo Zheng in a corner of the chaos as he had done to Gerald.</p>

  <p>If Othniel had done so, it wouldn't matter how strong the man in black was.</p>

  <p>Finding a human in the vast chaos was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>
