<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite Luo Zheng's aggressive attack, it took time for Mathew to be convinced he was inferior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng might be good at practicing sword strikes, but would probably not be able to beat Mathew. What was more, Mathew had Jayden's help now, which meant that they could even defeat a Holy Being together.</p>

  <p>Annoyed, Mathew had chosen to fight Luo Zheng again head-on.</p>

  <p>But the result was cruel and not something that he had expected to happen.</p>

  <p>After his Invisible Incantation Sword had disappeared again, Luo Zheng had cut off his hand with one strike of his sword.</p>

  <p>If Jayden hadn't pulled him on time, Luo Zheng might have cut him in half.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Mathew began to believe that he was indeed no match for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Jayden, on the other hand, understood much more than Mathew did.</p>

  <p>It was true that Mathew was more powerful than Jayden, but Jayden was much more far-sighted than Mathew.</p>

  <p>Even as Luo Zheng was employing the Emotion Closing Godly Way, Jayden was planning to retreat.</p>

  <p>According to him, the passageway from the sixth stage to the upper stage had already been closed, so even if Luo Zheng had a pair of wings, he still wouldn't be able to leave the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>'It's not shameful that we didn't catch Luo Zheng. If Nicholas takes control of the Abyss Demon Region, it will be easy for us to kill him.</p>

  <p>Why would we have to risk our lives to fight this guy?' Jayden thought.</p>

  <p>But Mathew was a stubborn man. Now he wouldn't be able to deal with Luo Zheng, who was chasing him down.</p>

  <p>"Golden Sword Condensation!"</p>

  <p>Mathew yelled.</p>

  <p>He was firm about the fact that he would fight. So what if he had only one arm? His eyes gleamed with fighting intent.</p>

  <p>The Invisible Incantation Sword had blocked him several times now. But Luo Zheng uttered a single word, "Break."</p>

  <p>The explosive power on the Shadow Bearing Sword suddenly increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>The golden sword shattered and turned into golden runes again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was about to launch an attack when Jayden raised his snake spear and stabbed it at Luo Zheng yet again, from a different angle this time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was taken aback. It was true that he could kill Mathew with a sword strike. But if he did so, the snake spear would pierce his body and he'd either die or become seriously injured.</p>

  <p>He knew that it was unwise for him to injure himself so badly in such a dangerous place as the Abyss Demon Region. He had to dodge Jayden's attack.</p>

  <p>'He is still a Demi-holy Being!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't taken their strength seriously before this.</p>

  <p>But he had come to realize that their visions and judgments were far from anything an ordinary consummate True God could match up to.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a step backwards just as Jayden charged at him with his snake spear, his eyes flashing dangerously.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The snake spear began to spin at an incredible speed, a terrifying explosive force forming around it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was surprised to see Jayden launch the deadly attack after having restrained himself for so long.</p>

  <p>But he knew he couldn't panic right now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no intention of changing his mind.</p>

  <p>But he raised the Shadow Bearing Sword in his hand so that it was horizontal in the air between him and Jayden.</p>

  <p>He flicked the Shadow Bearing Sword, using seven moves in a row to dispel Jayden's attack.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>The excitement in the eyes hidden in the dark water grew.</p>

  <p>The owner of the eyes was not only pleased at Luo Zheng's swordsmanship, but also awed.</p>

  <p>He had created the Gods-intimidating Strike, but it was not complete.</p>

  <p>Except for the most formidable sword strike, this sword skill still had many shortcomings.</p>

  <p>And every one of Luo Zheng's moves was a perfect match. It looked like he was born for the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The owner of the eyes within the dark water didn't know that the simple swordsmanship that Luo Zheng had cultivated was suitable to the Gods-intimidating Strike, which was why Luo Zheng had succeeded in cultivating the Emotion Closing Godly Way. His achievement in swordsmanship had reached its peak after he watched and learned the Beginning Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Jayden's series of fatal attacks didn't work on Luo Zheng, but he didn't regret using them on him. He pushed Luo Zheng back for a distance and then returned to Mathew so that they could run away. Luo Zheng merely clenched his teeth as he watched.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, a ray of cyan light flashed in the distance.</p>

  <p>"A Holy Being?" Jayden squinted, trying to see who had made an appearance. As he spotted the figure, astonishment and vigilance took their places on his face. "Samuel!"</p>

  <p>Mathew laughed and said, "Great! A Holy Being is coming! He is the Holy Being of the Han Clan! I don't think you have the ability to survive a Holy Being's attack!"</p>

  <p>Mathew had wanted to kill Luo Zheng as soon as possible. But he was not strong enough to defeat him. And now that a Holy Being had appeared, he was overjoyed and didn't seem like a Demi-holy Being at all.</p>

  <p>However, Jayden was thinking differently.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had allowed Samuel to enter the Abyss Demon Region, but he had always been skeptical of him.</p>

  <p>Samuel had been arrogant before. After he had brought the Han Clan onto a Floating Island, he had turned down the generous invitation from the union of the powerful clans and hadn't even taken Nicholas seriously.</p>

  <p>But his attitude had changed a lot over the past few decades, which made others suspicious of him.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He was dozens of miles away, but Samuel had sent something towards them.</p>

  <p>The cyan light swept across the fifty miles between them and shot towards Luo Zheng. It split the space between Luo Zheng and the two Demi-holy Beings, forcing Luo Zheng to retreat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression shifted into one of wariness as he watched the light split the space.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew he could win against a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>But he had no idea how to deal with a real Holy Being.</p>

  <p>What was more, Samuel was also one of the strongest Holy Beings, which was why he had fought alone and made the Han Clan become one of the top ten powerful clans in the past.</p>

  <p>It took Samuel only six seconds to reach Mathew and Jayden.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your help," Mathew said, bringing his hands together in respect and gratitude.</p>

  <p>Everyone could call Samuel 'Holy Samuel' out of respect.</p>

  <p>But Samuel was not in a high position in the alliance of powerful clans, which was why he wasn't qualified to be conferred that title.</p>

  <p>Samuel fixed his gaze on Luo Zheng as he smiled and said to Mathew, "Who said I was helping you?"</p>

  <p>Mathew was confused.</p>

  <p>Jayden's brow furrowed as he thought for a little while, instinct telling him that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" Mathew asked.</p>

  <p>Samuel said calmly, "I was worried that if Luo Zheng didn't kill you completely, wisps of your souls might escape and return. It would be a problem if that happened, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>Jayden and Mathew were shocked at Samuel's words.</p>

  <p>They weren't stupid to not see that something bad was about to happen.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Demi-holy Beings were about to escape, Samuel clenched both his hands and sent two killing forces towards them.</p>

  <p>Mathew had barely opened his mouth when the force struck him and he shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" cried Jayden angrily, but before he could say anything else, his body also shattered into a thousand pieces.</p>
