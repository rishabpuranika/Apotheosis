<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though he had received the praise of the emperor of York Divine Kingdom, Logan could only smile before asking, "Who else wants to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Ever since Logan first wielded his Space Chopping Sword, two people already had their arms chopped off. The initial excitement of the Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists disappeared and the crowd turned silent.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they lacked self-confidence. Out of all the martial artists of the divine kingdoms who could stand on the first tier, which one of them wasn't an outstanding character of their respective martial house? If they didn't have absolute confidence in themselves, they wouldn't be able to stand on the first tier.</p>

  <p>However, Logan was just too outstanding, causing the talents on the first tier to hesitate.</p>

  <p>It would've been fine if they won, but what if they lost?</p>

  <p>They still had to head toward the Feather Holy Sea. Losing arms wasn't a big problem, but they wouldn't be able to return to peak condition in a short period, so it would be quite a burden along the journey.</p>

  <p>In the very beginning, the match had only been held for entertainment before entering the Feather Holy Sea. But after many years of evolution, it had slowly turned into a battle among the young warriors of the four divine kingdoms, giving them a chance to show off their strength.</p>

  <p>Even so, compared to exploring the secret lands within the Feather Holy Sea, it wasn't all that important.</p>

  <p>With that, many of the first tier talents began to retreat.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that the imperial members on the stairs were beginning to get angry. Although the Soul Sea Realm masters kept quiet, they were inwardly unhappy with Logan and War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>Once again, the Star Field Divine Kingdom was defeated. This time, it was the Wind and Harlen Divine Kingdoms' turn.</p>

  <p>The emperor of the Wind Divine Kingdom didn't say a word, nor did the crown prince and the other princes behind him.</p>

  <p>Turner, the emperor of Harlen Divine Kingdom, scanned over Randy and the crown prince Bram, his eyes flashing. Even in his silence, his gaze told them everything.</p>

  <p>Under such a gaze, Randy felt his heart heat up in nervousness. Just as he was about to recommend Luo Zheng, Bram was already one step ahead. In a clear voice, he said, "Edwin Xiao will fight on my behalf!"</p>

  <p>Randy's gaze turned cold at his words, but he remained silent.</p>

  <p>'Since you're determined to make a comeback, just do it. Edwin is your last chess piece. If he's defeated or even loses an arm, it will be a huge blow to your team. You'll face many difficulties exploring the secret lands. Let's see if you will fight personally after Edwin loses, ' Randy thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Bram was rather anxious. He spoke highly of Edwin and Gregory, and he wanted to prove himself in front of Turner. He wanted to prove that he had good judgment and skill in controlling others. But Gregory let him down, having been so easily defeated in battle.</p>

  <p>Now, Edwin was the only one he could place his hopes on.</p>

  <p>The Dark Martial House was the largest martial house in the entire Harlen Divine Kingdom. Although it was considered a sixth-grade force like the Jade Martial House, the latter could only be ranked second.</p>

  <p>Because Edwin was the strongest in the Dark Martial House, the crown prince, along with many of the Harlen Divine Kingdom's martial artists, had high hopes for him in the coming fight.</p>

  <p>Hearing the crown prince's declaration, Edwin lept up and cupped his hands toward the prince and the emperor before pulling out a spear from his space ring.</p>

  <p>"It's a top-grade sacred weapon!"</p>

  <p>"The martial artists from the Harlen Divine Kingdom are enviable. Those who have reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm can obtain top-grade sacred weapons. I'm green with envy!"</p>

  <p>"Well, as you know, the Harlen Divine Kingdom has a plethora of weapon refiners. Most of the sacred weapons in the divine kingdoms are made by them. Similarly, the Wind Divine Kingdom has an abundance of alchemists, and the York Divine Kingdom has many runic experts."</p>

  <p>It was undeniable that the Harlen Divine Kingdom's refining techniques were the most famous and, more importantly, weapon refinement was a tradition within Edwin's family. Even so, top-grade sacred weapons were still very rare. In any other situation, Edwin wouldn't have such a sacred weapon with him.</p>

  <p>But because exploring the secret land of the Feather Holy Sea was a huge deal for his future, his family had provided him with such a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, the spear seemed to be extremely flexible. As Edwin brandished it hard, it was like a whip smashing into the air, creating a deafening explosion.</p>

  <p>Edwin's gaze was ice-cold as he stared at Logan.</p>

  <p>This time, Logan raised his open palm facing him. "Five strikes. I only need five strikes to defeat you."</p>

  <p>With a cold snort, Edwin returned, "Cut the crap. Don't make the fight child's play. I don't care how many strikes you need. Victory or defeat will be decided soon!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Edwin's statement, Logan smiled mischievously. "This opponent isn't bad. It seems I need to be more serious!"</p>

  <p>"What does that mean? Didn't he already go all out?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe that. He's so pretentious!"</p>

  <p>"He defeated Gregory with three strikes and Willard with four. Maybe he really didn't use his full strength."</p>

  <p>Except for those of the York Divine Kingdom, other martial artists seemed to have the same hatred for a single enemy. Logan was just too arrogant. Still, he had the right to be arrogant as his strength was immeasurably strong. So far, no one had even touched him.</p>

  <p>This time around, it was still Logan who took the initiative to launch the first attack. His body became as fast as a shuttle, piercing through space as he brandished the deadly Space Chopping Sword in his hand once again.</p>

  <p>With a cold snort, Edwin held the long spear in his hand as it coiled around his limb like a snake.</p>

  <p>The speed of Logan's Space Chopping Sword was extremely fast, but after Edwin coiled his spear, it immediately began to shake and fly out. It was as fast as lightning, charging toward Logan.</p>

  <p>Before its tip stabbed at Logan, the flexible, long spear circled the Space Chopping Sword before moving forward and stabbing right at Logan's face.</p>

  <p>Not only did Edwin's spear seal Logan's Space Chopping Sword, it also wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>Logan's Space Chopping Sword was undoubtedly sharp, and an ordinary sacred weapon wouldn't be able to resist it. However, Edwin's spear was a top-grade sacred weapon. It was also flexible. As it twined around the sword, the weapon was sealed to the point of immobility.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The tip of the spear was like the head of a venomous snake, going straight for Logan's face. When Logan slightly tilted his head, the tip of the spear brushed past his ear.</p>

  <p>But the spear seemed to have a will of its own. As soon as it missed, it twisted again and went for the back of Logan's head.</p>

  <p>Putting on a faint smile, Logan loosened his grip on the sword. Suddenly, he sank just as his sword disappeared. Being a space-made weapon, even if it disappeared, Logan could remake it in an instant.</p>

  <p>In just one strike, Edwin had forced Logan to give up his weapon and choose to retreat.</p>

  <p>With that, it had to be considered the best result so far.</p>

  <p>The crowd from the Dark Martial House immediately sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, in their hearts, the younger generation of the Harlen Divine Kingdom had no way to defeat Logan. The fact that Edwin forced him to retreat like that saved some face for them.</p>

  <p>However, Bram and Turner didn't agree.</p>

  <p>For the dignified Harlen Divine Kingdom to be unable to find anyone to confront Logan, it was something they wouldn't ever be able to accept.</p>

  <p>Although the kingdom had been rather weak over the years, they weren't weak to such extent.</p>

  <p>Bram's eyes darkened at the thought. He already began putting together plans in his mind. If Edwin really lost, he might even make it on stage to crush Logan. As the crown prince of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, he had the obligation to protect the dignity of his kingdom.</p>

  <p>Although it would be shameful for him to fight in person as the prince, he couldn't care less about that fact at the moment.</p>

  <p>Lowering his body, Logan pulled back to put some distance between him and his opponent. With a wave of his hand, another Space Chopping Sword appeared in his hold.</p>

  <p>"Not bad. You remind me that I should be a little more serious!"</p>

  <p>Logan pointed his sword straight at Edwin.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap!" Holding his spear with one hand and pressing the spear's body with the other, he swept his fingers along the spear.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>Then, he lifted his spear. The weapon seemed to have a mind of its own as it turned into a snake, coiling around Edwin, with its tip pointing right at Logan.</p>

  <p>A smile hung on Logan's lips as he gently waved the Space Chopping Sword in his hand. In the next moment, he struck a second time.</p>

  <p>After Edwin activated the spirit of the spear, it was like a beast with a keen sense of smell, attacking Logan the moment he got close.</p>

  <p>Tinkle!</p>

  <p>The tip of the spear pierced Logan's body, but just then, the space armor covered his body once again.</p>

  <p>With that defense, the spear only left a deep mark on his space armor. It couldn't completely penetrate it. Rather, it was impossible to break through in a single strike.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the expressions of the Harlen Divine Kingdom's martial artists seemed to turn grim.</p>

  <p>Originally, everyone was sure that Logan would be unable to condense the space armor after he had condensed the Space Chopping Sword.</p>

  <p>Presumably, he just believed it to be unnecessary.</p>

  <p>But this fellow possessed invulnerable space armor, as well as the Space Chopping Sword that could slice through anything in its path. How could they hope to defeat him? It was no exaggeration to say that their odds were slim to none.</p>

  <p>Just as they all thought, Logan, whose attitude began to take a serious turn, simply gave up on dodging and defense, allowing Edwin's long spear to pierce him. Meanwhile, the Space Chopping Sword in his hand continued to slide into space and slash at Edwin.</p>

  <p>A third strike, a fourth strike, and then a fifth strike…</p>

  <p>After the fifth strike, Logan slid to the side. With a spray of blood in the air, another arm fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>The crown prince's gaze flickered unsteadily. Disappointment was evident in his eyes as his brows creased. What should he do? Was he really going to fight on his own?</p>

  <p>At that moment, his gaze suddenly landed on a somewhat skinny figure on the square. It was Luo Zheng, with his eyes fixed on the battle.</p>
