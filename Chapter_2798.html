<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the cold air gently swept past his back, Clark felt like his back had lost all feeling.</p>

  <p>But since he was a Holy Being who cultivated the Elementary Fire Godly Way, the cold air didn't actually manage to hurt him.</p>

  <p>He had barely had to think about it before the internal momentum in his body had begun circulating madly, expelling all the chillness inside his body.</p>

  <p>But while this stream of cold air didn't hit Clark, the one behind him wasn't so lucky.</p>

  <p>That was Abelard, a Holy Being from the Qin Clan.</p>

  <p>Before Abelard could react, a stream of cold air hit him squarely in the chest.</p>

  <p>Even though he was one of the top Holy Beings, he didn't even have time to say anything; there was merely a stunned expression that froze on his face.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Abelard turned into an ice sculpture and plunged into the darkness like a stone.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings near him might have been able to stop him from falling, but they were all wary of this strange cold air. It was more like a cold poison without an antidote!</p>

  <p>Nobody came to his rescue, and he soon disappeared in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>They all held their breath as another two streams of cold air swept past them. Luckily, these streams passed without hitting or killing anyone.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, everyone in the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands began to panic over Abelard's sudden death.</p>

  <p>After all, the Holy Being of the Qin Clan had been on par with Murphy, Jeremiah, and Clark, but he had died just like that in the blink of an eye. It was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>No one dared to make a move in this situation.</p>

  <p>However, the intervals between the eruptions of the ice volcano were very short.</p>

  <p>Whooshing sounds began coming from below, meaning that the cold air at the bottom was about to erupt again. Whatever it was, they had to make a decision right now.</p>

  <p>Most of them gritted their teeth and entered the next groove. At this point, it seemed like they would die either way, but they had a better chance of surviving if they stuck with Nicholas, who might be able to solve the threat in the grooves.</p>

  <p>But a small group of people began to hesitate...</p>

  <p>After all, the safer option of returning to the previous groove was too tempting.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Two consummate True Gods and two Demi-holy Beings made their decision and returned to the last groove.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as they returned, their faces filled with regret.</p>

  <p>During a moment of desperation, they had forgotten that if they went back, they would have to face that horrible woman...</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Cold air surged up and sealed all the grooves.</p>

  <p>The two consummate True Gods and two Demi-holy Beings had no way back.</p>

  <p>The woman glanced at them and said coldly, "Get out!"</p>

  <p>The two Demi-holy Beings were from the Liu Clan and the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>Initially, they were flustered, but soon, they calmed down.</p>

  <p>Although they could sense a trace of evil radiating from the woman's body, she didn't seem like a bloodthirsty person.</p>

  <p>Maybe they could beg her to spare their lives.</p>

  <p>"It was a critical situation just now. We will go down again when the next interval comes," the Demi-holy Being of the Liu Clan said, clasping his hands together to beg her.</p>

  <p>The other three observed the woman's expression secretly.</p>

  <p>If this woman chose to attack them, they would definitely not sit still, but it would be ideal if she was willing to spare their lives.</p>

  <p>"Are you getting out of here yourselves or do you need me to send you out?" Her voice became colder.</p>

  <p>The four men looked miserable. They knew that no matter how they answered this question, they would die.</p>

  <p>Before the four men could beg for mercy, several forces came from behind the woman and attacked the four warriors.</p>

  <p>The invisible forces which were activated by the clones of the Holy Beings could topple mountains and overturn seas.</p>

  <p>How could the four of them resist these forces?</p>

  <p>They were promptly pushed out of the groove, exposing them to the cold air. In an instant, the four of them turned into ice sculptures which fell down immediately.</p>

  <p>Without having a chance of even struggling against the clones of the Holy Beings, they died instantaneously.</p>

  <p>As Zheng watched this scene, he frowned.</p>

  <p>As if having noticed Zheng's expression, the woman said, "Those who are not one of us are ants. You and I are both people of the Nine Li race. We shouldn't show mercy to ants."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>This woman had been born in the Abyss Demon Region. It was meaningless to reason with her.</p>

  <p>In the groove below, three heads were smashed into pieces. The ground was covered with transparent fragments of their heads.</p>

  <p>These heads belonged to the Cold Fiends that the woman had just mentioned.</p>

  <p>They were not really powerful, but the cold air that they spewed out of their mouths was fatal!</p>

  <p>The remaining members of the alliance looked deathly pale.</p>

  <p>In the span of just a few seconds, Abelard, two Demi-holy Beings, and two consummate True Gods had died!</p>

  <p>Although they hadn't seen the scene with their own eyes, they had known that the four were forced to their deaths.</p>

  <p>"This woman is going too far!"</p>

  <p>Clark said angrily through gritted teeth. He had been on good terms with Abelard, so he was more furious than the rest.</p>

  <p>"Should we continue to go down? God knows what strange things we'll find below... " Zeke said.</p>

  <p>Even the Holy Beings couldn't keep themselves safe in such a damned place!</p>

  <p>"Yes, let's go on," Nicholas said firmly with a gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>That woman was guarding the mouth of the volcano with a group of Holy Beings' clones. They had no choice but to move forward now.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed. When the interval came, Nicholas rushed out first again. "I will check whether there is any danger in the next groove. You can enter it after you get my message."</p>

  <p>In fact, regardless of whether there was danger or not, everyone had to get in, because if they went back, they would have to face that woman, which would be like facing certain death.</p>

  <p>The remaining two-thirds of the journey was far smoother.</p>

  <p>There were only a few Cold Fiends and Explosive Crystals scattered in the grooves created by Sword Chen's clones.</p>

  <p>All the Explosive Crystals had already exploded. And for the Cold Fiends, they weren't much of a threat as long as the members of the alliance were cautious and prepared. Every time, Nicholas was able to shatter the Cold Fiends the moment he found them.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands finally reached the last groove at the bottom of the ice volcano.</p>

  <p>"Look! It looks like a huge hive!"</p>

  <p>"There are so many Cold Fiends... I never imagined that the cold air was being spewed out of their mouths!"</p>

  <p>"The sight of them packed together so densely is disgusting!"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods stretched their necks to take a look at the scene below.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because they had been so frustrated and frightened all the way that they felt a little excited after getting through the tough journey and finally reaching their destination.</p>

  <p>There was a small mountain at the bottom of the ice volcano, and the surface of this mountain was covered with hexagonal grids. They wondered whether these grids were naturally formed or man-made.</p>

  <p>Each hexagon was inlaid with a translucent Cold Fiend.</p>

  <p>These Cold Fiends looked up at the sky and, with their mouths wide open, they unceasingly spat out cold air. As millions of Cold Fiends spat out cold air at the same time, they created the wondrous eruption of the ice volcano.</p>
