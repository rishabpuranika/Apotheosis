<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3777 The Eighteenth Layer </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>During the period he was unable to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, aside from comprehending the Truth Enlightenment, he turned into the incarnation to enter his inner world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven continuously transformed Zheng's inner world, which made more and more strange things appear.</p>

  <p>After he heard the related introduction, Zheng made his way to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Over the several months of her pregnancy, Margaret's belly grew day by day. She would give birth in four months' time.</p>

  <p>Being cared in the fairy palace also meant that she was in good hands. They were so meticulous so there'd be no room for accidents and mistakes. It was during this month that Zheng spent most of his time lounging around in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Days went by, and eventually, one month had passed.</p>

  <p>With his physical body, Zheng entered the Other Shore and appeared on the bone island.</p>

  <p>The creatures on the Other Shore were basically the natives to the place.</p>

  <p>They were aware of the Source World below the Other Shore, but because of the Element Spirit race, they were hostile to the warriors from the Source World all the time.</p>

  <p>But since Zheng showed up, they finally had the opportunity to understand him. After all, they still wanted to know more about him.</p>

  <p>"Buddy, can your body withstand all the suffering when you travel back?" the member of the Sturdy Bull race asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't return just by traveling," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Oh really? What method do you use?" another Other Shore creature asked.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Zheng answered, "Maybe I have created a new body."</p>

  <p>There were various debates on the relationship between the warrior's form on the Other Shore and that in the Source World. However, there remained a common truth that the warrior created an identical avatar on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You created a new body? Can your another body move?" The strange questions made Zheng morose.</p>

  <p>After he answered them with a few perfunctory words, the Other Shore creatures stopped asking.</p>

  <p>A period of time later, the skull rose once again. Its jaws opened, which revealed a set of bone stairs.</p>

  <p>After they entered the wide space under the island, the Myriad Tribulations Storm began to spin once more. Everyone was cautious, and they stepped on the bone plates as they made their way into the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>Zheng entered the third layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm in order to receive the baptism of the small water drops.</p>

  <p>Compared to everyone else, the member of the Sturdy Bull race was the most curious about Zheng. He remained at Zheng's side and reminded, "You've cultivated on the sixteenth layer for nearly a month, so cultivating here would be pointless. I suggest you enter the seventeenth layer, although that would be difficult for you..."</p>

  <p>Because he knew that Zheng stayed on the sixteenth layer for nearly a month, he assumed that this was Zheng's limit. The seventeenth layer would be a challenge to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around to look at the Sturdy Bull and nodded politely. He was not in the mood to argue.</p>

  <p>As he saw Zheng's disinterest, the Sturdy Bull shrugged his shoulders and moved away without another word.</p>

  <p>As the Chaotic Source Spirits grew to the size of an ant, they increased in speed as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved quickly to the fourth layer, the fifth layer, the sixth layer...</p>

  <p>The small light dots continued to grow, eventually into the size of a mung bean and then as big as a broad bean.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Zheng was finally back and safe in the sixteenth layer.</p>

  <p>The last time he was here, he reached his limit.</p>

  <p>However, this time was different. For some reason, there was still enough room for the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body to grow!</p>

  <p>Having stayed in the sixteenth layer for more than twenty hours, the Chaotic Source Spirits grew to the size of two broad beans. This was the standard size of the normal Chaotic Source Spirit. However, as the amount of the Chaotic Source Spirits increased threefold, the damage they could bear would naturally increase by three times.</p>

  <p>Naturally, this meant that within such a short period of time, Zheng reduced from the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm to the early stage, and then cultivated to the late stage again.</p>

  <p>Carefully, Zheng tilted the bone plate ever so slightly, but just as he was about to enter the seventeenth layer, the centipede beside him began to speak,</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to the guy from the Sturdy Bull race. The seventeenth layer is too much to handle, compared to the sixteenth layer. I would advise you to stay on the sixteenth layer for even a few more years."</p>

  <p>This was true. The Myriad Tribulations Storm had twenty layers, and the higher layer one attained, the more brutal the tearing force became.</p>

  <p>Although the centipede believed in Zheng's capabilities, he also knew well that everyone had a limit in terms of the growth and cultivation speed.</p>

  <p>In the centipede's eyes, the sixteenth layer was Zheng's limit, and entering the seventeenth layer was not going to be a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the kind reminder."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and smiled at the centipede. Then he moved on and entered the seventeenth layer without hesitation. He was quite eager to see the potential of the Chaotic Source Spirits, especially after their amount increased by three times.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>Beneath the tearing of the small water drops, the six hundred light dots in Zheng's body wore out quickly, while the Truth of Godly Way continually repaired the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"I can withstand that!"</p>

  <p>The corner of Zheng's mouth curled up in a grin. He looked around, but eventually his gaze fell on the tribulation skeleton opposite him. Within a second, his grin turned into a frown.</p>

  <p>A part of the tearing power of the water drops within the seventeenth layer was most probably borne by the tribulation skeleton. This was far beyond what Zheng wanted, and he was probably the first one to be displeased by this.</p>

  <p>"Really? Can you really hold on?"</p>

  <p>As the centipede saw this unfold, he couldn't help but let out a screech of surprise.</p>

  <p>He was shocked by what Zheng had achieved when he entered the Land of Bone Tribulation for the first time. But this time, the scene made him get even more shocked.</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng managed to step into the sixteenth layer with his unique body refining method.</p>

  <p>Then, after he cultivated in the Land of Bone Tribulation for a month, he entered the seventeenth layer. This was too fast.</p>

  <p>However, as the centipede was still speechless in surprise, he saw Zheng directly enter the eighteenth layer.</p>

  <p>For some reason, Zheng could still withstand everything!</p>

  <p>The black cracks that formed from the small water drops in the eighteenth layer resembled long bugs, lasting longer than those in the previous layers.</p>

  <p>Therefore, their tearing power naturally increased by several times.</p>

  <p>Over time, the six hundred Chaotic Source Spirits in his body dimmed and were repaired again and again. Within a few minutes, Zheng regained the balance point. He was ready to continue on.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the tribulation skeleton opposite Zheng underwent an unprecedented refinement.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng was much more vigilant than last time!</p>

  <p>As he received training, Zheng studied the Chaotic Source Spirits all the time.</p>

  <p>After all, the energy of the water drops in the eighteenth layer was several times stronger than that on the sixteenth layer. If the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits failed to work, his body would be shattered by the small water drops...</p>

  <p>On one hand, Zheng made sure he paid attention to the Chaotic Source Spirits, always checking if they turned non-effective. Simultaneously, he expected they would split up again.</p>

  <p>If one Chaotic Source Spirit divided into three like before, this meant that the six hundred Chaotic Source Spirits in his body would be divided into a thousand and eight hundred. If this happened, the Chaotic Source Spirits could withstand around one hundred thousand divine megatons of force, which would help him a lot in his quest.</p>

  <p>A few minutes had passed and Zheng observed the Chaotic Source Spirits continuously.</p>

  <p>Eventually, sixty hours had passed and he finally saw that the light dots of Chaotic Source Spirits in his body began to flash. Each of the light dots divided into three dots, dimming quickly throughout the process.</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>Zheng drove the bone plate and leaned backwards, after which he rushed out of the Myriad Tribulations Storm at high speed.</p>

  <p>But even though Zheng reacted quickly, his physical body could not escape the water drops of the eighteenth layer. Within seconds, the long and thin black cracks created wounds across his back, chest, and legs.</p>
