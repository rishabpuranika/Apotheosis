</p>

  <p>Of the eight enchanted laps, the warriors of Central Region were only aware of two? one was held by Eddie, and the other was held by the World Commercial Alliance. No one knew who held the other six. Maybe the Bloodwood Cliff had one, maybe the Mysterious Luna Hall, or perhaps the owners did not even reside in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, no matter who the owners of the other six enchanted lamps were, those who held one hoped that the last enchanted lamp would be lit by tonight.</p>

  <p>As the various lamps danced in the sky like tiny, flickering stars, a lone figure stood on a platform at the edge of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The lamps were beautiful and elicited a soft sigh from Ning Yudie. The elders of Cloud Hall had already received news the day before that the last enchanted lamp had in fact been at her hands since months ago.</p>

  <p>It was a great shock, to say the least. None of the elders ever thought that, after so many years, the final enchanted lamp would actually belong to Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The Lantern Lighting Festival was a very significant event. Hidden deep within the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb were countless precious treasures that would make any great warrior drool.</p>

  <p>These treasures were the primary reason why many warriors had, time and again, gone to the Chaotic Ocean of Stars in hopes of sneaking into the celestial tomb. Hundreds of thousands of warriors ventured forth, but none of them ever succeeded in even getting a glimpse of the treasures that the celestial tomb housed.</p>

  <p>It was said that the only way to get inside was to light all the nine enchanted lamps.</p>

  <p>However, a lot of people thought it couldn't just be as simple as that, so a lot of conspiracy theories had been circulating all around Central Region.</p>

  <p>Some people believed that the whole thing was a trap. Why would Immortal Mist leave behind nine enchanted lamps to make it easier for outsiders to enter his tomb?</p>

  <p>It was highly suspect, even for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the mind of a warrior would never be deterred by just mere conspiracy. An opportunity always came with risk, and a timid warrior, unwilling to face that risk, would simply never grow.</p>

  <p>After finding out that the last enchanted lamp had been with Ning Yudie all this time, six elders of Cloud Hall had then banded together and decided to enter the celestial tomb, all for different reasons.</p>

  <p>For Emanuel, his tyrannical strength and relatively young age made it a given that he was pursuing a greater opportunity in the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>For Elder Fernandez, who was already very old, he was also pursuing a great opportunity that would hopefully lead to a breakthrough or else he would reach the end of his lifespan and die.</p>

  <p>Venturing to the celestial tomb was a great gamble for the realization of their own interests.</p>

  <p>Imogen, like Elder Fernandez, had also decided to go as her need was even more urgent than his. As a warrior at the Life and Death Realm, it was only fitting that she had to face a life and death crisis. However, she knew that she would not be able to survive the second life and death crisis? it was her destiny to die.</p>

  <p>So her only hope was to find the legendary Flower of Life and Death.</p>

  <p>"Let's light up the enchanted lamp," Ning Yudie ordered in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and quietly circulated his life vitality onto his hands, forming a tongue of flame that slowly floated towards the enchanted lamp.</p>

  <p>And just like that, the ninth enchanted lamp was finally lit.</p>

  <p>All the enchanted lamps were finally lit, and those that held the other eight were rejoicing.</p>

  <p>"The ninth mark lit up!"</p>

  <p>Hobbes laughed out loud in the World Commercial Alliance's headquarters.</p>

  <p>In the Dreamy Swampland, the short warrior's tense expression slowly relaxed as he stared at the enchanted lamp in front of him.</p>

  <p>Even Eddie was excited.</p>

  <p>It was something they had all waited for over a thousand years. Of course, everyone would be excited.</p>

  <p>After all nine enchanted lamps were ignited, a huge building deep in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars started emitting a soft, green light. It seemed that the lighting of the ninth lamp had also awakened Immortal Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>A lot of warriors in the Central Region had seen this building before, but they could only look at it from across the sea. All the warriors who had ventured near the building had been killed by the special curse of the celestial tomb. Whether it be a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm or even the Life and Death Realm, the curse would indiscriminately kill them.</p>

  <p>As the celestial tomb emitted the faint, green glow, a halo suddenly appeared and started spinning slowly.</p>

  <p>Then, nine small light balls appeared at different locations.</p>

  <p>At the very top of the celestial tomb was a triangular secret room. Inside the room was a small crystal ball filled with fine powders that had existed for thousands of years. At that moment though, it seemed the powders were finally awakening. Inside the crystal ball, the powders had condensed and eventually turned into a black substance that morphed and fused together before turning into something that resembled a human face.</p>

  <p>"So slow! I didn't expect that I'd be waiting for more than two thousand years?"</p>

  <p>The face spoke hoarsely, as if extremely weak for having spent two millennia in deep sleep.</p>

  <p>In Cloud Hall, streaks of blue light had emanated from the enchanted lamp's smoke, rising and falling all around it.</p>

  <p>"A portal," Ning Yudie murmured.</p>

  <p>Although everyone knew that lighting the nine enchanted lamps was the only way to get into Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, none expected that the tiny lamp could actually summon a portal.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at her master and then at Luo Luo Zheng. "Let's get in."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and was the first to step into the blue vortex with Ning Yudie following closely.</p>

  <p>Imogen, the six elders, and some elite disciples of Cloud Hall followed suit.</p>

  <p>Although some of the elite disciples were only at the Internal Elixir Realm, the celestial tomb was sure to have many opportunities that could help them get stronger. As long as they did not die, they would surely benefit a lot from the trip.</p>

  <p>Upon stepping into the blue portal, everyone immediately felt as if they had been wrapped in a bright ball of light. What was strange was that this transmission array was extremely stable without any space windstorm.</p>

  <p>Such a method was far from what the warriors in Central Region knew of and was most likely made by Immortal Mist.</p>

  <p>The passage of time couldn't be felt within the spatial passageway. It was strange actually? it felt as if time was passing by very slowly, but at the same time, they were able to pass through the passageway in just the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the first out and the moment he left the spatial passageway, he immediately saw a huge, snakelike beast with a bloody maw charging straight towards him.</p>

  <p>He immediately adopted a fighting stance, ready to defend himself.</p>

  <p>However, before the beast even got close, it collided with a thin wall of light and bounced back, wandering deeper into the sea.</p>

  <p>"Leviathan! Its mouth can devour anything and its strength is comparable to that of a warrior at the Life and Death Realm," Ning Yudie said, arriving next to Luo Luo Zheng. "That beast is one of the reasons why it is so difficult for warriors to approach Immortal Mist's celestial tomb."</p>

  <p>A huge beast comparable to a warrior at the Life and Death Realm?The Chaotic Ocean of stars was truly chaotic.</p>

  <p>For those in the Central Region, the Chaotic Ocean of Stars was like a forbidden area. It was seemingly wide, where all kinds of ferocious beasts and creatures lived, numbering at around tens of thousands more than the entirety of creatures in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>It was even said that in the depths of the sea were a few races, tribes, and even entire countries that had adapted and flourished.</p>

  <p>"It's fortunate that there's an enchanted barrier outside Immortal Mist's celestial tomb," Luo Luo Zheng remarked. Even the Chaotic Ocean of Stars wasn't something he could imagine.</p>

  <p>Imogen, Emanuel, Elder Fernandez, Saint Morphens, and the others all left the spatial passageway.</p>

  <p>They had discovered that they were actually at the edge of the celestial tomb. In front of them was a long and narrow path while around them was an enchanted barrier that held back the endless seawater.</p>

  <p>"There's only one entrance," Saint Morphens said, standing in front of the passageway. It was then that he took out a "man" from his space ring.</p>

  <p>This man was no different from an ordinary warrior. However, there was no expression in his eyes. Though his skin and appearance were exquisite, his eyes were that of a dead man.</p>

  <p>The man then suddenly ran into the passageway at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>"It's a puppet!"</p>

  <p>This was Saint Morphens' puppet technique. Luo Zheng's eyes twitched as he remembered when he had just entered Cloud Hall, he had been manipulated by Saint Morphens for a very long time.</p>

  <p>The puppet was extremely useful for scouting the path to see if there were any hidden dangers or traps.</p>

  <p>Everyone waited for a bit before Saint Morphens nodded, "There are no dangers in this corridor. We can go in now."</p>
