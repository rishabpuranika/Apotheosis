<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch was infused with great power. After it hit the giant stone, a soft, muffled sound rang out.</p>

  <p>Peng!</p>

  <p>The sound seemingly came from inside the stone. It was not very loud, but everybody heard it clearly.</p>

  <p>Soon after, multiple cracks began to appear on the huge stone, making it look like an egg with cracks on its shell. As the cracks continued to appear on it, the giant stone began to collapse. A loud rumble accompanied that, and soon enough, the huge boulder was turned into dust.</p>

  <p>Then, a gust of wind blew past.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was immediately engulfed by the surging dust. After what seemed like an eternity, the dust finally dissipated and settled down, and the huge stone in front of him was no more. The only thing left was dust.</p>

  <p>Shock appeared on the faces of many green-skinned creatures who were on top of the city wall. It was only then did the creatures understand that the warrior in front of them was not someone they could underestimate.</p>

  <p>Immediately, they started screaming out words that Luo Luo Zheng could not comprehend.</p>

  <p>Even Malcom could not hide the shock on his face. If it was him in Luo Zheng's position, he would have had to use the forceful energy before he could easily turn such a large stone into such fine dust.</p>

  <p>But then the rules of this small world were different. Everyone was forbidden to use their forceful energy and life vitality no matter what happened. So basically, Luo Luo Zheng just relied on his physical body's force to do what he did. 'What kind of vicious beast is living inside Luo Luo Zheng?' Malcom thought, as he felt a bead of sweat stream down his forehead.</p>

  <p>Yolande understood Luo Zheng's intentions, so she turned to one of the green-skinned creatures on top of the city walls and said something. After the creature told her his reply, she turned to Luo Luo Zheng and said, "Let's go inside."</p>

  <p>They then entered the city. Its style was very different from that of the human race's city. Green-skinned creatures on the streets, who were all holding long spears in their hands, started surrounding them, but no one dared attack them. It seemed that Luo Zheng's punch had left a deep impression on them. In their eyes, a powerful master like Luo Luo Zheng would be virtually undefeatable.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, the green-skinned creatures made way for Luo Luo Zheng. Three of them walked in front of Luo Luo Zheng. The one in the lead wore a scarlet-gold crown on his head, and held a brocade box in his hands.</p>

  <p>After some thought, Luo Luo Zheng concluded that the one with the crown on his head was the land's emperor. This emperor signaled to Luo Luo Zheng to come closer, and they talked. After their conversation, he raised the brocade box high up in the air.</p>

  <p>Yolande, who was standing beside Luo Luo Zheng, interpreted what the emperor said for him. At one point, she whispered to him, "He said that they are willing to give us the sacred object, but on one condition."</p>

  <p>"What condition?" asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"We have to help them kill a race in the north," Yolande replied.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in doing that," Luo Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>He did not want to participate in any dispute between any races in this small world. There was no time he was willing to waste.</p>

  <p>Yolande immediately told the emperor about Luo Zheng's decision. When he heard that, disappointment was evident on his face. Despite that, the emperor still handed the brocade box over to him. Perhaps he understood that this sacred object was not something that his race could keep, and even if Luo Luo Zheng didn't go there to take it, the members from other races would take it away from them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took the brocade box from the emperor's hands and gently lifted the lid of it. Immediately, what he discovered wasn't what he was expecting. It was a long and narrow crystal, but it looked incomplete. Despite that, it was emitting a magnificent Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>When Yolande and Xun saw the crystal, their eyes burned with passion. They knew about the existence of the Heavenly Fragment, but this was the very first time they had seen it!</p>

  <p>Slowly, Luo Luo Zheng reached out to grab the fragment. The moment he touched it, it felt ice-cold. "Is this the Heavenly Fragment? It doesn't seem to be much different from any other ordinary crystal," he said flatly.</p>

  <p>However, all of a sudden, Luo Luo Zheng heard an intense rumbling sound. Confused, he looked around to see if anyone else was hearing it, but it seemed that no one but him was able to perceive it. Once again, he looked at the Heavenly Fragment and it hit him? the sound was coming from it. By touching it, the Mu Ning from the entire universe seemed to rush into his head.</p>

  <p>"This... this is..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened. At that moment, it was as if the entire evolution of the universe that had happened over a period of a billion years flashed before his very eyes. All the secrets of the world were slowly being revealed to him, one by one.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Yolande raised her hand and knocked the Heavenly Fragment from Luo Zheng's hand onto the ground. Immediately, Luo Luo Zheng snapped out of his trance, and started breathing heavily, as if he had just run a marathon. After he caught his breath, Yolande said flatly, "While your soul is indeed very, very powerful, it still can't handle this kind of object. Better be careful."</p>

  <p>"What is the use of the Heavenly Fragment?" Luo Luo Zheng asked exasperatedly.</p>

  <p>With hesitation in her eyes, Yolande looked at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "You will know when the time comes. I hope you make the right choice."</p>

  <p>At this, Xun rolled her eyes and coldly smiled. With a smirk, she remarked, "Why don't you just say that you want Luo Luo Zheng to stand by your side and on the side of Lord of Oracle?"</p>

  <p>Yolande belonged to the force of Lord of Oracle.</p>

  <p>Paying no attention to Xun, Yolande said faintly, "Luo Luo Zheng, you are fated to lead the great world of chaos. You have your own life and goals, and no matter which side you stand on, you will eventually take the correct path and live the life you are meant to live."</p>

  <p>Xun once again rolled her eyes. She couldn't be bothered by whatever Yolande was saying, and so she just turned her head to the side and stopped talking.</p>

  <p>The brocade box didn't only contain the Heavenly Fragment. It also held a small array plate.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"We'll need it when we leave the Fog Array," Yolande replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing Yolande's words, Esther and the others couldn't help but be surprised, and their eyes suddenly lit up. They couldn't care any less as to what the Heavenly Fragment was, but the array plate was extremely important to them as they would only be able leave the Fog Array with its help.</p>

  <p>After obtaining those two items, they no longer wanted to stay where they were. Because of that, they immediately packed up, and left the green-skinned creatures' city, returning to their original path.</p>

  <p>"How can we ever leave the Mad Scorpion's body?" Esther asked, sounding curious and hopeless at the same time.</p>

  <p>"The way we came in is the way we'd be able to get out," Yolande answered flatly, confidently taking the lead.</p>

  <p>"If we are able to escape the Mad Scorpion's interior world, then the creatures of this world should also be able to leave, right?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked. It was a thought that had been sitting inside his head for quite a while.</p>

  <p>Yolande laughed loudly and started shaking her head. "The creatures, who are born inside the Mad Scorpion and follow this world's rules, would not be able to see the exit of this world. We, being outsiders, are being suppressed and rejected by the governing force of this world, and so we are presented with a chance to leave!"</p>
