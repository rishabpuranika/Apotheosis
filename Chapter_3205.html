<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3205 Lady Flamine </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From atop the wall, the golden-armored guards watched Zheng knocking at the gate. Exchanging dubious glances, they started whispering amongst themselves in wonder.</p>

  <p>"This man isn't a servant of the Phoenix Palace. How could he have walked out of the Primitive Illusion?"</p>

  <p>Finally, the leading guard called Zheng's attention. "Who are you?" he shouted with a frown. "Why do you knock on the gate?"</p>

  <p>Zheng, looking up to face the guard, answered clearly, "I'm  Zheng Luo, a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect. I'm looking for Feng Ge."</p>

  <p>"A disciples of the Flow Sword Sect?"</p>

  <p>The guards exchanged puzzled glances.</p>

  <p>Their leader continued to speak to Zheng harshly. "I don't care which sect you are from. You are not welcome here. Get out!"</p>

  <p>The Phoenix Palace was where the direct descendants of East Emperor Taiyi lived. Additionally, it was the core area of the Oneness Mountain. It was impossible for ordinary people to enter.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression darkened as his patience ran thin. He leapt forward, and ricocheted off the wall, launching himself into the air. With a determined look on his face, he decided right then and there that he was going to break through the gate.</p>

  <p>Once the leading guard realized what he was up to, he sneered haughtily,</p>

  <p>"Never in my years here have I witnessed anyone attempt to break into the Phoenix Palace. Sir, you are courting death; don't blame me for killing you."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Eyes flashing menacingly, he then channeled his aura to summon a large golden shield, which smashed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>The leader had been a five-star Oneness Guard. Due to his excellence, he was transferred to guard the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>While the technique he used was relatively simple, the sheer force of the shield attack reached eight hundred divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as he observed the approaching shield. With gritted teeth, he summoned the strength from the Strength God Totem, while simultaneously gathering the Shade Stone's liquid into his right hand.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The other guards covered their ears in anguish at the deafening sound, lights flashing everywhere, which blinded them. When they finally regained their senses, they were stunned.</p>

  <p>Their leader had been flung off the wall, and had fallen into the square of the Phoenix Palace. The impact was so great that a crater was formed where he landed.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, stood firmly on the wall, unscathed.</p>

  <p>The guards shuffled backwards uneasily, maintaining a distance from Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Where is Feng Ge?" Zheng demanded once more, staring at the guards coldly.</p>

  <p>Although they trembled underneath their golden-plated armor, all the guards shook their heads in defiance.</p>

  <p>They knew their responsibility was to protect the Phoenix Palace; even if Zheng terrified them, they stood their ground.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng moved forward in a flash. In the blink of an eye, his hand was on the neck of one of the guards. With a restrained squeeze, he shouted, "Tell me.</p>

  <p>Now!"</p>

  <p>"I...I..." The guard was frozen in fear.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a clear voice came from inside the palace.</p>

  <p>"A mere disciple of the Flow Sword Sect dares to act wildly in the Phoenix Palace. Why do you think of us so lowly?"</p>

  <p>As the cool voice floated over, a purple ribbon snaked its way across the palace square, heading straight for Zheng.</p>

  <p>The purple ribbon, like a nimble dragon, shot towards Zheng in a zigzag motion.</p>

  <p>Zheng threw the guard aside to reach out and grab the ribbon. However, as soon as his fingers grazed the silken ribbon, it split into two, then four, until they coiled around his body.</p>

  <p>As the ribbons intertwined around Zheng, he felt a terrifying power. The ribbons tightened their grip on him.</p>

  <p>The pressure was not something that Zheng could withstand. Not long after, he found it difficult to breathe.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng was yanked forward by the ribbons, as though he was a mere puppet. It all happened so fast; his surroundings seemed to whip past him. He could barely make out being dragged through several palace gates, over gardens and courtyards.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Finally, Zheng smashed into the front door of one of the palaces.</p>

  <p>A woman garbed in purple stood not far away with crossed arms. Her fierce eyes studied the helpless figure before her, wrapped in purple ribbons.</p>

  <p>The woman stepped forward gracefully. Zheng noticed she had a pretty face.</p>

  <p>She was captivating at first glance.</p>

  <p>However, that didn't stop him from trying to wriggle his way out of the ribbons.</p>

  <p>No matter how much he twisted and struggled, he was unable to get rid of the seemingly ordinary ribbons.</p>

  <p>The woman was a little surprised. "You haven't gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, and yet your power is so extraordinary."</p>

  <p>Normal human bodies could withstand three hundred divine megatons of Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Some strong-built humans could withstand six hundred divine megatons of Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>For example, Marco's Other Shore Token, which could absorb his opponent's Other Shore Power, had the potential to unleash the force of five hundred divine megatons. Although he could only bear the force of three hundred divine megatons, the other two hundred divine megatons of force would be borne by his sword.</p>

  <p>As Zheng struggled, he also released a force of more than a thousand divine megatons. This would've been impressive for nonhuman creatures, all the more for humans!</p>

  <p>After struggling for a while, Zheng finally stopped. He twisted his body one more time, to face the beautiful woman wordlessly.</p>

  <p>By this time, the guards had rushed over, kneeling before the lady. Even the leader knelt humbly. "This person trespassed into the Phoenix Palace under my watch. We failed to stop him. Please, Lady Flamine, punish me."</p>

  <p>Flamine gave them an amused smile. She showed no traces of anger whatsoever. With an elegant wave of her hand, she said, "It's no big deal.</p>

  <p>You can leave now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lady Flamine!"</p>

  <p>The leader stood up with a salute. Turning to the other guards, he gestured for them to take the subdued Zheng with them.</p>

  <p>Flamine, however, stopped him. "Let him stay."</p>

  <p>"But this person trespassed into the Phoenix Palace. He needs to be punished severely!" the leader cried indignantly. As a five-star Oneness Guard, it was humiliating for him to have been sent flying by a Flow Sword Sect disciple's punch.</p>

  <p>"Let him stay. I need to talk to him," said Flamine firmly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lady Flamine!"</p>

  <p>The guards could do nothing but bow humbly to the woman and take their leave.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was just an ordinary disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, Flamine would have let the guards take him away.</p>

  <p>However, she could sense Zheng's extraordinary power. This definitely piqued her interest.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Flamine withdrew her ribbons, freeing Zheng from his shackles.</p>

  <p>"Why did you break into the Phoenix Palace, young man?" Flamine asked, eyes sparkling with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Rubbing his hands and neck, he answered calmly, "I'm looking for Feng Ge."</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge?" Flamine raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Why are you looking for her?"</p>

  <p>"She took my people away," Zheng answered bluntly.</p>

  <p>Scratching her chin delicately, she asked, "Why did she take your people away?"</p>

  <p>"God knows what that stupid woman was thinking!" he cried exasperatedly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe since she lost to me in the Seven Mountains Meeting, she has been holding a grudge towards me." Zheng shook his head in frustration.</p>

  <p>When Flamine heard Zheng cursing Feng Ge, her cheeks flushed red with embarrassment. "I can take you to see her."</p>

  <p>"You can help me find her?" Zheng's eyes lit up at her offer.</p>

  <p>"Of course. If what you say is true, I must make her apologize. After all, I'm her mother." She smiled cunningly.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned. He recalled how Konnor told him that Feng Ge had been brought back from the Divine Lair. Did this mean Flamine was also a nonhuman creature from the Divine Lair?</p>
