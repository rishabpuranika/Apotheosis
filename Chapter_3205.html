<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3205 Lady Concubine Yan </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From atop the wall, the golden-armored guards watched Luo Zheng knocking at the gate. Exchanging dubious glances, they started whispering amongst themselves in wonder.</p>

  <p>"This man isn't a servant of the Phoenix Palace. How could he have walked out of the Primitive Illusion?"</p>

  <p>Finally, the leading guard called Luo Zheng's attention. "Who are you?" he shouted with a frown. "Why do you knock on the gate?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, looking up to face the guard, answered clearly, "I'm  Luo Zheng Luo, a disciple of the Heart Flow Sect. I'm looking for Feng Ge."</p>

  <p>"A disciples of the Heart Flow Sect?"</p>

  <p>The guards exchanged puzzled glances.</p>

  <p>Their leader continued to speak to Luo Zheng harshly. "I don't care which sect you are from. You are not welcome here. Get out!"</p>

  <p>The Phoenix Palace was where the direct descendants of East Emperor Taiyi lived. Additionally, it was the core area of the Taiyi Mountain. It was impossible for ordinary people to enter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression darkened as his patience ran thin. He leapt forward, and ricocheted off the wall, launching himself into the air. With a determined look on his face, he decided right then and there that he was going to break through the gate.</p>

  <p>Once the leading guard realized what he was up to, he sneered haughtily,</p>

  <p>"Never in my years here have I witnessed anyone attempt to break into the Phoenix Palace. Sir, you are courting death; don't blame me for killing you."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Eyes flashing menacingly, he then channeled his aura to summon a large golden shield, which smashed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The leader had been a five-star Taiyi Guard. Due to his excellence, he was transferred to guard the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>While the technique he used was relatively simple, the sheer force of the shield attack reached eight hundred Jun.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed as he observed the approaching shield. With gritted teeth, he summoned the strength from the Strength God Totem, while simultaneously gathering the Shade Stone's liquid into his right hand.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The other guards covered their ears in anguish at the deafening sound, lights flashing everywhere, which blinded them. When they finally regained their senses, they were stunned.</p>

  <p>Their leader had been flung off the wall, and had fallen into the square of the Phoenix Palace. The impact was so great that a crater was formed where he landed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, stood firmly on the wall, unscathed.</p>

  <p>The guards shuffled backwards uneasily, maintaining a distance from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Where is Feng Ge?" Luo Zheng demanded once more, staring at the guards coldly.</p>

  <p>Although they trembled underneath their golden-plated armor, all the guards shook their heads in defiance.</p>

  <p>They knew their responsibility was to protect the Phoenix Palace; even if Luo Zheng terrified them, they stood their ground.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved forward in a flash. In the blink of an eye, his hand was on the neck of one of the guards. With a restrained squeeze, he shouted, "Tell me.</p>

  <p>Now!"</p>

  <p>"I...I..." The guard was frozen in fear.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a clear voice came from inside the palace.</p>

  <p>"A mere disciple of the Heart Flow Sect dares to act wildly in the Phoenix Palace. Why do you think of us so lowly?"</p>

  <p>As the cool voice floated over, a purple ribbon snaked its way across the palace square, heading straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The purple ribbon, like a nimble dragon, shot towards Luo Zheng in a zigzag motion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng threw the guard aside to reach out and grab the ribbon. However, as soon as his fingers grazed the silken ribbon, it split into two, then four, until they coiled around his body.</p>

  <p>As the ribbons intertwined around Luo Zheng, he felt a terrifying power. The ribbons tightened their grip on him.</p>

  <p>The pressure was not something that Luo Zheng could withstand. Not long after, he found it difficult to breathe.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was yanked forward by the ribbons, as though he was a mere puppet. It all happened so fast; his surroundings seemed to whip past him. He could barely make out being dragged through several palace gates, over gardens and courtyards.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng smashed into the front door of one of the palaces.</p>

  <p>A woman garbed in purple stood not far away with crossed arms. Her fierce eyes studied the helpless figure before her, wrapped in purple ribbons.</p>

  <p>The woman stepped forward gracefully. Luo Zheng noticed she had a pretty face.</p>

  <p>She was captivating at first glance.</p>

  <p>However, that didn't stop him from trying to wriggle his way out of the ribbons.</p>

  <p>No matter how much he twisted and struggled, he was unable to get rid of the seemingly ordinary ribbons.</p>

  <p>The woman was a little surprised. "You haven't gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, and yet your power is so extraordinary."</p>

  <p>Normal human bodies could withstand three hundred Jun of Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Some strong-built humans could withstand six hundred Jun of Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>For example, Marco's Other Shore Token, which could absorb his opponent's Other Shore Power, had the potential to unleash the force of five hundred Jun. Although he could only bear the force of three hundred Jun, the other two hundred Jun of force would be borne by his sword.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng struggled, he also released a force of more than a thousand Jun. This would've been impressive for nonhuman creatures, all the more for humans!</p>

  <p>After struggling for a while, Luo Zheng finally stopped. He twisted his body one more time, to face the beautiful woman wordlessly.</p>

  <p>By this time, the guards had rushed over, kneeling before the lady. Even the leader knelt humbly. "This person trespassed into the Phoenix Palace under my watch. We failed to stop him. Please, Lady Concubine Yan, punish me."</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan gave them an amused smile. She showed no traces of anger whatsoever. With an elegant wave of her hand, she said, "It's no big deal.</p>

  <p>You can leave now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lady Concubine Yan!"</p>

  <p>The leader stood up with a salute. Turning to the other guards, he gestured for them to take the subdued Luo Zheng with them.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan, however, stopped him. "Let him stay."</p>

  <p>"But this person trespassed into the Phoenix Palace. He needs to be punished severely!" the leader cried indignantly. As a five-star Taiyi Guard, it was humiliating for him to have been sent flying by a Heart Flow Sect disciple's punch.</p>

  <p>"Let him stay. I need to talk to him," said Concubine Yan firmly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lady Concubine Yan!"</p>

  <p>The guards could do nothing but bow humbly to the woman and take their leave.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was just an ordinary disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Concubine Yan would have let the guards take him away.</p>

  <p>However, she could sense Luo Zheng's extraordinary power. This definitely piqued her interest.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan withdrew her ribbons, freeing Luo Zheng from his shackles.</p>

  <p>"Why did you break into the Phoenix Palace, young man?" Concubine Yan asked, eyes sparkling with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Rubbing his hands and neck, he answered calmly, "I'm looking for Feng Ge."</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge?" Concubine Yan raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Why are you looking for her?"</p>

  <p>"She took my people away," Luo Zheng answered bluntly.</p>

  <p>Scratching her chin delicately, she asked, "Why did she take your people away?"</p>

  <p>"God knows what that stupid woman was thinking!" he cried exasperatedly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe since she lost to me in the Seven Mountains Meeting, she has been holding a grudge towards me." Luo Zheng shook his head in frustration.</p>

  <p>When Concubine Yan heard Luo Zheng cursing Feng Ge, her cheeks flushed red with embarrassment. "I can take you to see her."</p>

  <p>"You can help me find her?" Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at her offer.</p>

  <p>"Of course. If what you say is true, I must make her apologize. After all, I'm her mother." She smiled cunningly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned. He recalled how Konnor told him that Feng Ge had been brought back from the Divine Lair. Did this mean Concubine Yan was also a nonhuman creature from the Divine Lair?</p>
