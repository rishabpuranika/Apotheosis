  <p>
</p>

  <p>Jean was always arrogant in the Phoenix Palace, holding her head high. She wasn't afraid of anything other than Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>But she shivered violently as she faced this real crisis, fearful of what was to come.</p>

  <p>"Mother!"</p>

  <p>Even Cleon, Chance, and Ahmad who were sitting on the stairs, couldn't bear to see the timidity in her features.</p>

  <p>The three brothers were selfish but given that they were the sons of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, they remained calm in such a crucial life-and-death situation.</p>

  <p>They understood that they could hold high positions in the palace because Eastern Emperor Taiyi was their father. And now that their father was in danger of dying, they had obviously chosen to fight the invaders and protect him till the end of their lives.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to find a way out," Jean said, glaring at her sons to conceal her panic and embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Cleon was calm as he tried to persuade her. "Those powerful people have already surrounded the Primitive Illusion. We can't move Father even if we want to. We have no way out!"</p>

  <p>"If they break in, we should go all out!" added Chance.</p>

  <p>Those who sat on the stairs with him were all children and grandchildren of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge also sat beside them, an elbow on her knee, and held a piece of thin paper that had been floating in the wind with the other hand. A number of words were scribbled on it.</p>

  <p>At Chance's words, she merely looked indifferently at him.</p>

  <p>In such a critical situation, the three brothers became courageous and persistent, in sharp contrast to their mother. No wonder they were Feng Ge's half-brothers. They were much better than their mother.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge regretted coming back. No matter how exquisite the Truth Enlightenment was, it was useless in this moment. Her father couldn't even see it, and even if he did, what would be the use of it all in such a critical moment?</p>

  <p>Could the people around her defeat the powerful invaders above with it?</p>

  <p>She couldn't send the Truth Enlightenment to her father. Moreover, she was blocked here and couldn't go to the North Unicorn Province either.</p>

  <p>The news about the tragic battle in the North Unicorn Province was being brought to the Phoenix Palace and Feng Ge had learned of it the first time it had come here. As a "demon woman" from the Divine Lair, she knew better how terrible the Nine-Sun World Destruction was.</p>

  <p>'Have all the powerful warriors of the seven mountains been killed?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng should be the only exception. Has he survived?'</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a flame lit up from her fingertip and burned the paper.</p>

  <p>Xun, who was sitting on the step below Feng Ge, looked curiously at the burning paper and said, "Little Master, what are you burning?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge smiled and answered, "Something written by Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>At the mention of Luo Zheng's name, Liusu, Xun, and Nelly suddenly became interested. "What did he write?" they asked in unison.</p>

  <p>"The whole Truth Enlightenment," Feng Ge replied with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>The others didn't care about what Feng Ge was burning, but at the mention of the Truth Enlightenment, their gazes immediately shot to her.</p>

  <p>Even Concubine Yan, Jean, and a few strong masters who had stayed in the Phoenix Palace turned to her.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan asked, "Is that why you came back to the Phoenix Palace and wanted to meet your father?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Feng Ge said simply.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me this before?" Concubine Yan said, frowning.</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make if I told you?" Feng Ge asked as she stared up at Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan thought for a while and said nothing more.</p>

  <p>The whole Truth Enlightenment was important to Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>But with the crucial life-and-death situation in the Taiyi Heaven Palace at this point, it would be of no meaning to take it out.</p>

  <p>"But it shouldn't have been burned! That's the Truth Enlightenment!" Jean exclaimed, glaring at Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked coldly back at her. "So what? We let them take it away?"</p>

  <p>This was enough to render Jean speechless. They couldn't fend for themselves, let alone fight to keep this paper. Jean looked up at the sky, sighing in frustration.</p>

  <p>A thin fishing line was moving relentlessly in the Primitive Illusion.</p>

  <p>The thread acted as Ware's eyes. He could feel anything it touched.</p>

  <p>"I've found the sixth pillar. It is easier than I thought," Ware said with a happy smile.</p>

  <p>He had found six pillars in a short period of time, much faster than he had expected. It looked like it wouldn't take much time to find all the pillars in the Primitive Illusion.</p>

  <p>Ware was loud on purpose. His voice was loud as thunder, echoing clearly through the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>"The seventh pillar!"</p>

  <p>"The eighth pillar!"</p>

  <p>"The ninth pillar!"</p>

  <p>Every time Ware counted a number, the hearts of the people in the Phoenix Palace would tremble and skip a collective beat.</p>

  <p>"The sixteenth pillar!"</p>

  <p>"The seventeenth pillar!"</p>

  <p>"The eighteenth pillar!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The thin thread emitted a cyan light in the Primitive Illusion that penetrated the thick white mist with ease.</p>

  <p>The white mist that had been lingering over the Phoenix Palace all year round dispersed in an instant, revealing only eighteen bare pillars.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan stood at the top of the stairs in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall, her long luxurious sleeves fluttering. She looked at all the people sitting below and said firmly, "We have no way out. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi dies, we all will die. So please don't hold back!"</p>

  <p>Only seven people who were as strong as Concubine Yan stayed at the front of the Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Ripples spread before the Supreme Dragon Hall, and another big array rose into the air. Concubine Yan stretched out her legs and stepped gently into the air.</p>

  <p>She then reappeared at the center of the big array, the Three-Element Sword Array!</p>

  <p>Three long swords shot out of the array.</p>

  <p>These swords were the Heaven Sword, the Earth Sword, and the Human Sword. Concubine Yan, without any hesitation, took charge of the Heaven Sword.</p>

  <p>Another two masters followed her and grasped the Earth Sword and the Human Sword.</p>

  <p>Ware looked down at the Three-Element Sword Array in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall and said with a mocking smile, "I didn't expect such a dignified existence as Eastern Emperor Taiyi would rely on his wife to protect him. The Three-Element Sword Array is indeed powerful, but it's a pity that you meet me!"</p>

  <p>He then waved the fishing rod and barked an order, "Attack it! Hold the three swords and I'll continue to break the array!"</p>

  <p>"Now that victory is in sight, why should you be bothered? Master Ware, let me destroy this palace!" A short man behind Ware said anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Illusory Mountain Press!"</p>

  <p>The shadow of a huge mountain emerged from nowhere, dashing swiftly towards the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>This shadow was like an upside down mountain. Although it was virtual, the power contained within it was still terrifying.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the illusory mountain, Concubine Yan's expression shifted several times before she managed to calm herself.</p>

  <p>She waved the Heaven Sword lightly and said to the other two, "Three-Element Defense!"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With the joint resistance of the three swords, the illusory mountain was halted outside the array.</p>

  <p>An area of about ten thousand feet around the Supreme Dragon Hall was now protected, but under the pressure of the mountain shadow, all other halls and pavilions of the Phoenix Palace turned to dust.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>The short man stretched out his hands, and the huge mountain shadow solidified and became more powerful.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The Three-Element Sword Array sizzled under the pressure, but it finally managed to block the attack.</p>

  <p>"I'm in!"</p>

  <p>"Let's see how long you can hold on."</p>
