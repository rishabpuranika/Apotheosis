<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fact of the matter was, what Dillon was actually intending to say was that as Luo Zheng got increasingly powerful, eventually, even Arnold would end up being no match for him. Besides, Luo Zheng had already grasped the Perfect Brushwork at such an early age. On the other hand, Dillon had examined and analyzed the meditation runes presented by Michael painstakingly.</p>

  <p>Perfect Brushwork was not just the focal point of those runic textures. Their brand-new composition was just truly awe-inspiring as well. An adolescent wouldn't have a ghost of a chance of drawing them, but Michael wasn't really the type to fool around and make fun of things of this sort. So, Dillon had no choice but to take his word for it.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Shi, did you show up alongside Luo Zheng just to trick us?" Lady Poison-blood questioned him in utter bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Raven was also shaking his head. If they hadn't witnessed it with their very own eyes, there was probably no way they'd ever trust Dillon's words that Luo Zheng could rival Arnold at all. What did this entail?</p>

  <p>All of Arnold's unparalleled and never-before-seen rune accomplishments had already been deeply ingrained in the hearts of the citizens. How could Zheng's runes ever hope to hold a candle to Arnold's?</p>

  <p>"Dillon isn't trying to deceive you. As strange as it might seem, it's the truth!" Hobbes, wearing a vicious expression on his face, spat.</p>

  <p>These three mighty fat men were worlds apart in regard to their temper.</p>

  <p>Dillon was quite unpredictable but still knowledgeable. As for Hobbes, he was much like a bear with a sore head.</p>

  <p>"Hobbes, pull yourself together," Dillon said, shaking his head and feeling a bit irritated. "If you're having a hard time accepting that fact, why don't I just go ahead and show you the runes that were drawn by Luo Zheng? You might think that your eyes are playing tricks on you, but you'll be satisfied once you see them personally. He's only the second ever runic expert who has grasped the idea behind the Perfect Brushwork in the Central Region!"</p>

  <p>Just as Dillon was about to dispatch someone to get a hold of Zheng's runes, Luo Zheng suddenly let out a heavy sigh. These powerful men at the Virtual Tribulation Realm seemed like they really had a loose screw. A little irritated, he blurted out, "It would be such a bother. As I've mentioned before, the Dragon Soar Arena has gone back to how it originally was. Why don't you just go send someone there to check it out?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng say that out loud, all the strong men at the Virtual Tribulation Realm had been left dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>For sure, they weren't really dim-witted. However, they became stiff from being at such a loss for words because of what Dillon had just told them. As he said, Zheng's skills were in the same league as Arnold's. This lit a fire under the warriors, piquing their curiosity in Zheng's runes as they reflected on whether Dillon was telling the truth or not.</p>

  <p>With their memories jogged by Luo Zheng, they recalled what had transpired on that day.</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea. We can ask someone to verify Zheng's claim! Jordan, you go ahead and give it a go!" Raven opened his mouth before anyone else, and then he tossed a dragon-shaped jade pendant he was holding to a warrior belonging to the Black Mountain Sect.</p>

  <p>Jordan also attacked Luo Zheng just moments ago. But Raven's words made his spirit soar that he almost sprung up immediately.</p>

  <p>For Jordan, this was, without a doubt, the perfect chance. Most warriors, including the ones at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, had no access to the Dragon Soar Arena to reach the Upper World to train themselves, let alone those who belonged to the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>"Very well! I shall leave at once." At Raven's behest, Jordan marched toward the arena.</p>

  <p>The other green-eyed sect leaders could only watch from afar as Jordan stepped foot into the arena. If Luo Zheng was speaking the truth, Jordan was in for an unbelievable deal.</p>

  <p>The warriors were silently biding their time down at the arena for the reason that it would take quite a while to make one's way up from the first to the sixth floor.</p>

  <p>After approximately one hour, Jordan ultimately passed the trials within the arena and scaled the summit.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A moment passed by and a ray of white light emanated from the topmost portion of the arena.</p>

  <p>Now, the gaze of the bravest and mightiest in Oracle City had been fixated on the light. Even those elders who hadn't shown themselves before focused their attention on it as well.</p>

  <p>"Shoot!"</p>

  <p>A towering pillar of blinding white light ascended from the arena and pierced right into the sky, vanishing into the farthest ends of the heavens!</p>

  <p>"Was he able to pull it off?"</p>

  <p>The leaders were raging with excitement. Jordan arrived at the arena and flew away, proving once and for all that Zheng's claims were indeed true.</p>

  <p>Witnessing all of that with her own two eyes made Tia even more doubtful, feeling like something was quite amiss. Could Luo Zheng really be that good?</p>

  <p>Why would he be so considerate as to repair the rune on the sixth floor without asking for anything in return? Could he have some ulterior motives?</p>

  <p>Most of the other leaders were thinking the exact same thing. After Jordan took off from the arena, Raven was actually holding an extra jade card in his hand. "This right here is Jordan's life jade card. If Jordan ends up dying, this is going to be shattered."</p>

  <p>Stating that, he then nonchalantly tossed the jade card onto the top of the arena, leaving it there to spin continuously. It would actually take so long before they could find out whether Jordan was safe or not, but they weren't really aware that there was a good chance Jordan wouldn't ever be coming back.</p>

  <p>Now that they had concrete proof that the arena had been brought back to its original state, the strong men at the Virtual Tribulation Realm decided to just relax and take it easy. Time was on their side, so there was no need to be in a hurry to check whether the arena was secure or not.</p>
