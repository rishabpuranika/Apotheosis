<br/><br/>

  

  <p>After the long-haired man ran around with the joy of gaining his freedom, he cast his gaze at Luo Zheng. A hard-to-read look flashed on his face as he said, "No matter who your enemies are, I will kill them." He then looked at the dungeon and let out a laugh. "As for the guys in the dungeon, it's better to let them stay there!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng let out a faint smile. He knew he didn't need to release everyone in the dungeon. If Blayd alone was enough to kill Pranav, Mateo, and Marko, there was no need for him to release the rest prisoners from the dungeon.</p>

  <p>"If you really have the balls to kill the three people I just mentioned,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said. "Then there's no need to release them." He gave a small nod.</p>

  <p>At first, the people in the dungeon were not willing to take the inner demon oath, but hearing Luo Zheng and Blayd's conversation brought them to a panic. Previously, Luo Zheng had something to ask for them, so he offered to release them. The chance would be long gone at this point.</p>

  <p>The thought of this brought a lot of anxiousness to the encaged warriors.</p>

  <p>"Blayd! What are you saying?"</p>

  <p>You want to burn the bridges? You ungrateful bastard! I should have never taught you my cultivation method!"</p>

  <p>"Well... Your name is Luo Zheng, right? I will swear by my inner demon. I, Master Evil, will listen to your commands in this life. If I disobey in any way or form, I will be attacked by the inner demon and suffer through my own death." Just then, his old voice echoed off the walls of the dungeon.</p>

  <p>Apart from Master Evil, another person who was called Big Mouth spoke up loudly, "I am also willing to take the oath! I, Wayne Wu, am willing to submit to Luo Zheng in this lifetime. If I break my oath, I will be burned by the inner demon and suffer through my own death."</p>

  <p>Seeing that two warriors couldn't wait to take the oath, Blayd looked quite defeated at the sight of this.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, Blayd was captured by Bromley and taken captive to the fairy palace. However, Bromley did not imprison him in the depths of the dungeon. Compared to the three old freaks in the dungeon, he was deemed unqualified to be locked up in dungeon.</p>

  <p>However, Blayd, who was locked out of the dungeon, had gained a lot of things from Wayne and Master Evil by cheating. If these two people were released at the same time, they would definitely find out the truth and take revenge on him, and that was why he had been so against the idea of Luo Zheng releasing anyone else from the dudgeon just now.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to release them. I can help you kill those three True Gods. Even if they are the disciples of a Holy Being, they shouldn't be my match," Blayd advised.</p>

  <p>"You, I knew you were a swindler!"</p>

  <p>"Wait till I come out and tear you apart!"</p>

  <p>As the two people heard Blayd's words, they were enraged and profanities and cuss words echoed back and forth within the dungeon.</p>

  <p>"I'll release them. After all, they have already taken the inner demon oath," Luo Zheng said. He paused for a moment and then continued on, "I don't care what grievances there are among the three of you. Since you've taken the oath, you have to behave before me. As for what you will do after you accomplish the task, that's all up to you."</p>

  <p>Blayd agreed to Zheng's suggestion. Compared to the two vicious fellows left in the dungeon, he seemed to have a more stable consciousness. If he fell into their hands, he already knew what would come out of this.</p>

  <p>After all was settled, Luo Zheng asked Blayd to wait by the side while Luo Zheng made his way into the entrance of the gloomy, rotten dungeon.</p>

  <p>Leading to the entrance of the dungeon were moss-covered steps and liquids dripping from the ceiling. The walls on both sides of the dungeon were also covered with mosses, which moved against the walls as if they were alive.</p>

  <p>Out of curiosity, he stopped in his tracks to examine them carefully, but once he tried to move forward, a force locked his feet to the ground, leaving him unable to move.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned and instantly tried to wriggle his limbs out. However, he came to notice that the mosses on the ground began to motion towards him rapidly, and spread like wildfire. They began to wrap around his feet, then ankles, and made their way up to his legs, trapping Luo Zheng and gluing him in his place.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng concentrated a huge dose of strength to his feet. As he heaved his way out of the infesting mosses, he heard someone from a distance.</p>

  <p>"This moss is unique to the Swirl Forest. You're quite lucky that you have great strength, and that you run fast. If any ordinary True God found themselves here, they'd be dead in a matter of minutes," Master Evil chuckled.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier of the fairy palace enclosed everything from the forest. However, the moss would be one of the exceptional creatures that could escape and make its way around.</p>

  <p>The simple, adorable plant seemed harmless on the outside. Yet despite their looks, they still contained a terrifying devouring force. Moreover, these things had an extremely strong vitality. Even if someone tried to clear and uproot them, they'd be back within days.</p>

  <p>Every so often, the True Gods in the dungeon would clean out the mosses in the dungeon. Master Evil even used the flames to destroy them around the inside and outside of the dungeon, but the mosses still flourished nonetheless.</p>

  <p>"Who knew moss could be so magical? The Swirl Forest though, you have mentioned... is that huge forest right outside this fairy palace?"</p>

  <p>This was the first time Luo Zheng ever heard the name of this forest, and he soon realized that the fairy palace was actually built in this forest.</p>

  <p>It might have been that Luo Zheng said something that triggered him, because Master Evil pretended not to hear his question and said, "Come in quickly and get us out of here. We'll help you deal with the strong enemies and then we'll never see each other again!"</p>

  <p>The inner demon oath they had taken was something to be taken seriously. They knew they were to follow Zheng's orders for the rest of lives.</p>

  <p>These people were all powerful, renowned warriors of the divine land.</p>

  <p>For them to willingly follow someone's orders their whole lives was something no one would have guessed. They knew what they were getting into, so they had a plan. After helping Luo Zheng kill his enemies, they'd move very far away. It would be best if they never saw Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Master Evil didn't want to answer his question, Luo Zheng didn't push him further. So he continued on his journey and walked quickly down the stairs. Eventually, he entered a narrow corridor and found that the dungeon wasn't big. There were only two cells on this floor and there were bright bars erected around the cells.</p>

  <p>These bars would have to be made of the same material as the Fairy Chain, and they were probably here for countless years. Notably, the bars shone brightly. Luo Zheng also noticed that there were a lot of potholes on the bars -- most likely made by prisoners who wanted to break the bars and escape.</p>

  <p>Through the bars of the first cell, Luo Zheng saw an old man with a head full of silver hair sitting inside. This man had intimidating eyebrows, deep set eyes, and a pointy hooked nose. The corners of his mouth sagged along with his mustache hanging off the sides. His features were strange, and would have left anyone at a deep confusion upon seeing him. He gave off a strong sense of malice and viciousness. Luo Zheng assumed that this person must be Master Evil.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sized up the old man, and the old man did the same to Luo Zheng. After they gave each other good looks, Master Evil sneered and said, "I have wondered what kind of warrior was chosen by Bromley to be his disciple, but it seems that it is a warrior that has nothing special."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored him. He simply activated the heaven token and a gray light shot out towards the silver bars in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>The moment the light entered in between the bars, dense cracks started to appear on them. As they collapsed, they disappeared before Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Previously when Luo Zheng released Blayd, he had been amazed that the material used for the chains was magical because they disappeared and evaporated like water. For some reason, this kind of material could actually imprison True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Ding, ding, ding..."</p>

  <p>As Master Evil saw the bars dissipate, he extended out his hands in front of Luo Zheng in a plea. "Please!" There were two Fairy Chains holding his arms together.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng untied the two Fairy Chains binding Master Evil, the latter stretched out his wrists and rubbed them with his palms. A joyful smile then appeared on his face. To gain freedom was indeed something that could make one wild with joy. However, when such smile appeared on Master Evil's sinister face, it was quite uncomfortable to look at.</p>

  <p>With a flip of his body, Master Evil immediately disappeared in front of Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng merely felt a gust of wind brush past him and when he turned his head to look, Master Evil had already rushed out of the dungeon.</p>

  <p>"Hey, please don't forget me! I'm still locked inside!"</p>

  <p>An anxious voice called from the other cell.</p>

  <p>Wayne, the Big Mouth, was imprisoned here together with Master Evil for countless years. When he saw that Master Evil had been freed, he was itching to get out as well.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng arrived in front of Wayne's gloomy cell, he couldn't help but let out a laugh. This Big Mouth really lived up to his name. He had a huge mouth, and his lips were like two sausages, making him look very amusing.</p>
