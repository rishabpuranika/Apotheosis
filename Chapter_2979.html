<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2979 The Mice League </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Excellence City was the first big city to be seen after one had successfully crossed the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>Trade groups would usually choose to take a rest in the city. There were also many warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Not knowing why Luo Zheng asked such a question, Kenelm replied with caution,</p>

  <p>"Big commercial groups arrive at the East Port of Excellence City every day, and those business groups all have Other Shore Realm warriors. So, yeah, there were Other Shore Realm warriors that entered this city. Luo Zheng, are you looking for someone in particular?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head slightly and said, "I'm looking for a woman at the Other Shore Realm."</p>

  <p>He then proceeded to describe Emily's appearance roughly, including the way she dressed.</p>

  <p>"Mmm. Don't think I've ever seen her before." Kenelm shrugged as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, of course, wasn't surprised at all. He believed that seeing as Emily was the most powerful warrior in her group, the man in white would focus on chasing after her in particular.</p>

  <p>Even if Emily had all the luck and succeeded in ditching the man in white, she would still have to keep her identity a secret. In other words, with the way Luo Zheng was looking for her, it would undoubtedly be fruitless. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded briskly and then stood up, preparing himself to leave.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure, but perhaps the members of the Mice League know... If you want to buy news from the Mice League, I can take you there," added Kenelm.</p>

  <p>"Huh? The Mice League? What's that?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>A trace of surprise crept across Kenelm's features. "Luo Zheng, have you truly never heard of the Mice League?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. He really didn't know who, or what, the Mice League was.</p>

  <p>"Then it'll be worth the trip, Luo Zheng. Trust me on that one. There's probably nothing in this world that the Mice League don't know about, but their information must be purchased with divine crystals. I'd be curious to know if you have enough divine crystals to purchase their information..." Kenelm explained.</p>

  <p>When he heard Kenelm mention divine crystals, Luo Zheng immediately asked,</p>

  <p>"Do you know how many divine crystals they require if I want them to help me find someone?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say at least a whole divine crystal would be needed," answered Kenelm, hesitating a little.</p>

  <p>Considering that Luo Zheng didn't even know about the Mice League and that the Excellence City was very close to the Wild Goose Pass, Kenelm suspected that Luo Zheng came from some remote area outside the Source World. Generally speaking, the people from remote areas were usually very poor, causing Kenelm to believe it impossible for Luo Zheng to possess many divine crystals, if any at all.</p>

  <p>In an attempt to coopt Luo Zheng, Kenelm considered whether or not to pay it for Luo Zheng. It still remained that to him, a divine crystal was a large sum of money, so he hesitated on making a decision.</p>

  <p>"An entire divine crystal?" Luo Zheng was stunned by the price and it could be heard in his voice.</p>

  <p>He didn't have a concept about a divine crystal's true value. The legacies he had obtained were left by Chiyou back in the divine land. On this trip to the Source World, he had brought nearly half of his divine crystals with him.</p>

  <p>The price? one divine crystal, was unexpectedly much too cheap in his opinion.</p>

  <p>Kenelm, on the other hand, misunderstood Luo Zheng's reaction and thought Luo Zheng was terrified by how expensive it was.</p>

  <p>He continued to believe that getting Luo Zheng over to his side after paying the one divine crystal for him would be worth it. After all, he was short of hands at this time. He gritted his teeth and said, "The information coming from the Mice League isn't cheap. If you really can't afford the price, I just might be able to help you out."</p>

  <p>Staring at Kenelm's begrudging expression, Luo Zheng suddenly found the situation quite funny. He believed, however, that Kenelm was well-intentioned.</p>

  <p>A divine crystal was a very valuable object to a consummate True God. Luo Zheng was quick to grasp the fact that this person was trying to pull him over to his side. Still, he was thankful for Kenelm's generosity. Seeing as they had just met, it was very rare for anybody to offer such a gesture.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be hassle, no worries. Although the price for a piece of information is high, I can still afford it. Please lead the way," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Kenelm looked at Luo Zheng suspiciously. He continued to doubt the fact that Luo Zheng could afford a divine crystal, but he still led him away from the building.</p>

  <p>"So, tell me, who established the Mice League? Can you really buy information from them?" Luo Zheng questioned.</p>

  <p>Both the Sweltering Desert and the surrounding areas had vast spaces, and the description Luo Zheng had provided of the woman he was looking for was almost without any features. Thus, he held a skeptical attitude as to whether or not he'd obtain any information from the Mice League.</p>

  <p>Kenelm, on the other hand, really sounded quite confident. "Since you've never heard of the Mice League before, you certainly don't know how magical they are. They really know everything. You will soon understand what I'm saying."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, they had walked across more than half of the city, ultimately reaching the east end.</p>

  <p>The streets in the east of the city were even wider, but there were fewer people. After a short while, they stopped in front of a big house. Two tough-looking guards stood with their arms crossed at the door. They were strong cultivators at the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>The way they dressed themselves was odd, though. They were both wrapped in dark robes, which seemed to have the function of blocking the spiritual senses from outsiders.</p>

  <p>"Here we are. Luo Zheng, you can enter freely. The Mice League have many rules.</p>

  <p>I can only wait outside," said Kenelm flatly.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked toward the entrance, one of the guards came up to him and asked, "Are you looking for someone or something in particular?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he heard the guard's voice, Luo Zheng frowned slightly. The voice was so sharp that he felt it wasn't even human.</p>

  <p>"Looking for someone," replied Luo Zheng with certainty.</p>

  <p>"And are you aware of the rules?" the guard continued to question.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," replied Luo Zheng, a little less confidently this time.</p>

  <p>"Once our information is sold, there will be no refund. Moreover, you can't tell anyone that the information comes from us. If you violate the rules, you will be placed on our hunt list," the guard continued speaking in a shrill voice.</p>

  <p>'These rules...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself quickly for a moment and soon understood.</p>

  <p>No matter where it was, sensitive information was bound to exist.</p>

  <p>Logically, it must also be risky for the Mice League to collect information from everywhere. If somehow, the information was leaked, resulting in angering certain powerful warriors, the Mice League would be the ones to face the consequences. Therefore, simply put, the Mice League had created these rules in order to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to follow these rules?" the guard asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head in agreement. "Of course I do..."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he suddenly saw the guard's real face through the gap in his robes, and Luo Zheng was absolutely shocked.</p>

  <p>The guard had a sharp, straight mouth, two bean-shaped eyes, and his face was covered with very fluffy, gray fur.</p>

  <p>He clearly wasn't human. Oh, no, he definitely wasn't... He was a mouse!</p>

  <p>The guard also noticed Luo Zheng's astonishment and tightened his grey robes at once. Then he said in a sharp voice, "Go inside! Turn left and go straight to the end. From there, you'll get the information you're looking for. Go on!"</p>

  <p>Both guards were actually ferocious mice!</p>

  <p>If he were in the divine land, Luo Zheng would have already killed them in the blink of an eye. However, this was the Source World, and there were many things about this world that Luo Zheng couldn't understand yet, after all. For this reason, he suppressed the desire to kill that overwhelmed his mind and soul.</p>

  <p>'There's no wonder it's called the Mice League! It was probably formed by a group of mice!'</p>

  <p>As these thoughts raced through Luo Zheng's mind, he entered the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he set foot inside the courtyard, Luo Zheng heard mice all over and everywhere. They were of different shapes and sizes, running around at free will.</p>

  <p>Just as he was told, Luo Zheng turned left and walked to the end of the path. There, he saw a white curtain.</p>

  <p>As he approached, a sharp voice was heard coming behind the curtain.</p>

  <p>"Come in!"</p>

  <p>'Is there also a ferocious mouse inside?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but think as he lifted the curtain with one hand.</p>
