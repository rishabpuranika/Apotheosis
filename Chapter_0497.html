  <p>
</p>

  <p>They understood that Luo Luo Zheng came back to bring light and hope to the Luo Clan. Thanks to him, the clan would be saved.</p>

  <p>The members rushed over to Luo Luo Zheng one by one, gathering around him in a circle.</p>

  <p>Many of them had tears in their eyes that threatened to spill over. They were much moved by Luo Zheng's arrival for it brought hope for their family. It was hard to express this appreciation in proper words. They were truly touched.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you guys! You welcome my older brother but forget about me?" asked Yan from behind them. Her eyes blinked and her lips turned down in a pout.</p>

  <p>"Brother?" one of the members heard Yan's words and had a close look at her. "My God! It's Yan!"</p>

  <p>"Yan is back, too!" someone yelled loudly.</p>

  <p>"What? Didn't Perrin tell us that Yan was locked up in the Hell Mountain?"</p>

  <p>They didn't have comprehensive knowledge about the Hell Mountain, only that it was a place that held complete misery? the place any disciple of Cloud Sect who violated the rules was thrown into to suffer endless torture and inhuman treatment.</p>

  <p>Once, Yan had been the best descendant of the Luo Clan. She had been admitted to Cloud Sect especially because of her great talent in the martial arts. It had been a proud moment for every member of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Later, they heard that Yan was punished and imprisoned at the Hell Mountain. No one received any information about her ever since. They still didn't know what happened to her in all those years.</p>

  <p>Now, to their amazement, Yan was back!</p>

  <p>And Yan's strength seemed? profound? too great to be detected by them. How strong was she now? It seemed that the momentum exuding from her body was a million times stronger than Bryson's.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was at the third grade of the nature level and was restraining his real momentum. The descendants then thought that Luo Zheng's strength was comparable to Bryson's. It might even be slightly better than his, but not much more. Of course, they still felt that Luo Zheng's strength was sufficient enough for him to take over the master's position of the family even at such a young age.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, they sensed that Yan's strength was far stranger from theirs.</p>

  <p>Seemingly, she had stepped into the level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. The life vitality inside her body felt much more delicate and the momentum she emitted was simply impossible for them to ascertain.</p>

  <p>Bryson paled in comparison to her strength. He was at a much lower level and far weaker than Yan.</p>

  <p>Although Yan's actual strength was comparable to Luo Zheng's? even a little bit poorer than his, the members of the Luo Clan concluded that she was much stronger.</p>

  <p>The little girl who used to run around in the yard of the Luo house all day long had now become a girl with such formidable power! It was incredible.</p>

  <p>"Keep walking!" Luo Luo Zheng interrupted simply.</p>

  <p>Armed with his Streamer Sword, Luo Luo Zheng shuffled forward inside the Luo house, followed by his companions.</p>

  <p>Those who dared to resist him, show hostility, or were identified as enemies of the Luo Clan were to be killed by Luo Luo Zheng instantly without demur.</p>

  <p>Any member of the Luo Clan who was willing to side with Luo Luo Zheng followed behind him. Some members from the other branches of the Luo Clan too tagged along.</p>

  <p>After all, they were all members of the same family. They were supposed to be each other's flesh and blood, to stick together through thick and thin. Luo Luo Zheng intended to rid the Luo Clan of the unpleasant sores that plagued it through cruel means, and if any of the members showed signs of genuine repentance, Luo Luo Zheng would allow himself to forgive them initially and spare their lives. Yet, after he was through sorting out the affairs of the family and putting it in the right order, he would still punish those who had bad behaviors, as per the rules of the family.</p>

  <p>The further they walked, the larger the number of people who joined Luo Zheng's entourage became, and the greater momentum the group had.</p>

  <p>Unwittingly, Luo Luo Zheng led his team members to the doors of the Martial Arts Hall.</p>

  <p>Seeing the hall where he had been punched and tortured for two whole years, all sorts of emotions welled up in Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the moment, many children were exercising martial arts inside the hall.</p>

  <p>How did they exercise? They threw punches after punches at the men before them, most of whom were prisoners sentenced to death but bought by the Luo Clan at high costs. The prisoners were tied up and unable to resist, most of them on their last breaths thanks to the continuous blows.</p>

  <p>Yet, a small number of them were not condemned as prisoners. Such was the case with Melvin, who was a member of the Luo Clan. At this very moment, wearing a piece of leather armor to protect himself from getting punched too hard and dying, he was handcuffed and shackled while being beaten violently, punch after the next punch.</p>

  <p>Melvin was born with superhuman strength, and although he was the son of a concubine, he had good talent. He had punched Luo Luo Zheng back during his training. Later, after Luo Luo Zheng hit Grey, he had approved of Luo Zheng's behavior.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's view, he was one of the members of the Luo Clan who were both courageous and honorable.</p>

  <p>But according to the current state of affairs, his courage and uprightness meant that he was bound to offend an increasing number of people. As a result, he ended up being framed by vile characters: punished, locked in the dungeon and turned into a training tool.</p>

  <p>The person who was punching Melvin was Miles, the son of the second branch of the Luo Clan. He was also Perrin's younger brother. Since Perrin's rank as the young master of the Luo Clan was now abolished, the title was naturally taken up by Miles.</p>

  <p>A young man in a yellow robe stood next to Melvin. "Little rat, I see you're quite enjoying yourself," he said. "This looks very interesting. Let me try too, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Darcy, if you so want to," Miles said, a wide smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!"</p>

  <p>"But if I throw a punch at him, I'm afraid he'll die. What should I do?" asked the man named Darcy.</p>

  <p>"Darcy, there is nothing to be afraid of. These training tools are just that? tools. Nobody cares if they die. Rest assured and punch him as you wish. Even if they die, nobody will trouble you. Haha!" Miles said to him, smiling courteously while he threw a contemptuous glance at Melvin.</p>

  <p>Melvin, all battered and abused, burst out with a heavy face, "Miles!</p>

  <p>Even if I, Melvin, am the training tool, it's only for the purpose of training the members of the Luo Clan. He is an outsider. What allows him to punch me?"</p>
