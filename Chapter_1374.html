<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The long line that the four thousand people had formed could be divided into three echelons.</p>

  <p>The first echelon had only about twenty martial artists, and they had already advanced eight hundred miles in the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>Although this region's Law Storm was much stronger, these super talents didn't feel any pressure.</p>

  <p>They were competing against each other to be the fastest. The moment they had entered the Enchanted Barrier Tower, they had rushed off at full speed towards the one-thousand-mile mark.</p>

  <p>The fastest warrior at the moment was one from the Shadow Palace whose surname was Li. He was completely surrounded by a black domain that immediately swallowed any law fragments that approached him. He was using this method to advance rapidly, and the law fragments in the Law Storm were failing to hinder him.</p>

  <p>Javier was the second fastest. He was an excellent warrior among those who had ascended to the Upper World. There weren't any tricks involved in his advancing within Law Storm; he relied completely on his own strength. He kept an eye on the Law Storm as he advanced.</p>

  <p>"Nine hundred miles done," Layla mumbled to herself. "Another 100 miles to go." She smiled at this and ground to a halt.</p>

  <p>The martial artists in the first group weren't too far apart from each other, just a mile or so apart. Everyone was pushing their individual speeds to the limit.</p>

  <p>So when Layla stopped suddenly, the other warriors rushed past her, leaving her behind.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, she had dropped from the third place to the end of the first echelon.</p>

  <p>The martial practitioners who had surpassed her were puzzled. Nobody knew why she had stopped so suddenly.</p>

  <p>But Layla only paused for a minute. With a light flick of her wrist, green rays of light spread out from behind her back, forming two wings that radiated the green light.</p>

  <p>She flapped her wings gently and nimbly flew forward.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Her speed left a trailing smear behind her.</p>

  <p>By then, the martial artist surnamed Li had become excited. He had already traveled 950 miles. He only needed 50 more miles to reach the destination.</p>

  <p>He did not care about the reward, a mere Tribulation Exterminating Pill.</p>

  <p>Everyone could obtain that. But the Shadow Palace had secretly promised him that if he came to be the fastest to finish traveling one thousand miles, he would be rewarded with a first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>He wanted to help Shadow Palace get this glory.</p>

  <p>And he was just about to succeed! But it felt like success had come too easily to him.</p>

  <p>But just as he advanced, a whistling sound caught his attention. A shadow flew past him, causing his vision to blur for a moment.</p>

  <p>'Eh? What was that?'</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen Layla clearly. Under the ravaging of the Law Storm, everyone's vision had been limited to a very small range. And he thought that the movement was caused by the storm.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the old man in cotton clothes spoke.</p>

  <p>"The first warrior to travel one thousand miles is Layla Ai of Mist Palace."</p>

  <p>Li was stunned at this, his face filled with disbelief. "Wh-what?"</p>

  <p>Outside the Enchanted Barrier Tower, the old man and many other palace heads stared at the pair of wings on Layla's back, amazed.</p>

  <p>"Those are the Green Wind Wings!</p>

  <p>This girl is still at the Life and Death Realm, but she is already able to control this pair of wings!"</p>

  <p>"To use Green Wind Wings, doesn't one have to cultivate the embryo of the Green Wind Spirit in the elixir field? She is only at the Life and Death Realm. How was she able to do that without opening her Soul Sea?"</p>

  <p>Green Wind Wings were not something that a human could possess. It came from the abilities of a special creature in the storm, the Green Wind Spirit.</p>

  <p>Those with these wings could soar thousands of miles in an instant.</p>

  <p>The Green Wind Spirit was not an ordinary creature. It was impossible for a martial artist to inherit or obtain their bloodline.</p>

  <p>But in order to become stronger and faster, every martial artist would rack their brains to come up with a method to obtain those wings. In the end, someone had thought of a way. They got the embryo of the Green Wind Spirit, put it into their elixir field, nurtured it with their life vitality, hatched it, and gradually controlled the wings.</p>

  <p>This method was extremely dangerous and costly. Moreover, if there was even the slightest mistake, the warrior's elixir field would be damaged, and he would become a cripple.</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, there were very few warriors who could catch the embryo of the Green Wind Spirit, and even fewer who could successfully nurture it. Those who did succeed were at the Spirit Supreme Realm or higher.</p>

  <p>At the moment, they couldn't understand how Layla, who was at the ninth level of the Life and Death Realm, had obtained these wings.</p>

  <p>Layla stopped and looked back after she had covered the thousand miles.</p>

  <p>She had left everyone else far behind and this brought a smug look to her face.</p>

  <p>'Too easy. This is not challenging at all. I wonder what place Luo Zheng is in now. That fellow can't fight for the first place in the first one thousand miles anymore.' Even though she had obtained first place in the first one thousand miles, Layla didn't let her guard down. Her premonitions were always accurate, and according to her, the actual competition between her and Luo Zheng was yet to come.</p>

  <p>Four hundred miles away, Luo Zheng continued to fly at a moderate pace. He smiled as he heard the old man's voice.</p>

  <p>The first squad of martial artists had already crossed one thousand miles.</p>

  <p>The martial artists in the second squad had covered between seven hundred and eight hundred miles. The slowest of the martial artists in the third squad had traveled 500 miles, while the fastest had covered 600 miles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, was even not close to the third squad.</p>

  <p>'I can't figure it out, so I'll forget about it for now, ' he thought. He shook his head to dispel all thoughts and quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>The intensity of the Law Storm within the first thousand miles didn't fluctuate a lot.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, Luo Zheng finally crossed a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>By then, all the warriors in the three squads had passed this stage. He was still the slowest.</p>

  <p>He felt the Law Storm become stronger beyond the first one thousand miles.</p>

  <p>'This Law Storm should be a circle, and we should be closer to the center.' This reminded Luo Zheng of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>The storms of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars were formed by the Wind Law only, not like the disordered Law Powers around him. But although the Law Storm was a little stronger, it still didn't put much pressure on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Outside the Enchanted Barrier Tower, the old man in cotton clothes said,</p>

  <p>"Three thousand miles is a hurdle. Many warriors would be eliminated before they reach the destination."</p>

  <p>One of the palace heads nodded and replied, "Some of the Law Power will condense after a thousand miles. It becomes stronger. The key question is: how will these warriors deal with it?"</p>

  <p>"Where is the slowest little guy? Is he still at the end?" A palace head laughed.</p>

  <p>"That's right. That little fellow is quite strange. He's already beyond a thousand miles, but he still hasn't used his life vitality. Could it be that he doesn't intend to use it at all?" another palace head said, amused.</p>

  <p>These palace leaders had discovered that Luo Zheng was special.</p>

  <p>This wasn't, in any way, a form of praise. They just thought he was weird.</p>

  <p>They were all paying attention to the martial artists of their own palaces.</p>

  <p>Layla had won the first prize in the first one thousand miles. Now it was time to compete in endurance, to see who could travel the farthest in the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists were having a difficult time walking forward in the endless Law Storm. The martial artists of the first group had kept their pace, but those of the second group had slowed down by a great deal.</p>

  <p>From time to time, a highly powerful fire spirit would emerge from the storm and fly towards the warriors.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, a black wind blade would appear all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>These dangers were fatal, so everyone had to be careful.</p>
