<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4330 The Point Of Origin </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once the traction force appeared, the Evil God did not launch another attack on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had just killed the downgrader yet again, and he faintly guessed that this traction force somehow originated from the downgrader.</p>

  <p>He and Luo Zheng stood on the edge of the Wall World, and they passively gravitated towards the center.</p>

  <p>What would they find in the interior of the World of Nothingness? Neither Clarence nor Mastema had a clear comprehension of it.</p>

  <p>Since the perfect land had been downgraded, the two of them could accurately predict each lower-grade world. To downgrade, he only needed to extract some details from those worlds, and there were some rules to follow. It was by following these rules that the Evil God had successfully restored the energy step by step.</p>

  <p>The more details that were extracted, the less would be left.</p>

  <p>Very few details remained in the third-grade Lower Extreme World, but at least it could still sustain life.</p>

  <p>However, in the Wall World, there were so few details remaining that nothing could live there at all.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, the details of the first-grade world had been completely extracted, so it created an absolute void, and it couldn't even accommodate souls. This was why it was called the World of Nothingness.</p>

  <p>After hearing Clarence's explanation in his mind, Luo Zheng asked, "Can you survive within the World of Nothingness?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, but the world may not be exactly as I have theorized," answered Clarence.</p>

  <p>"We'll see soon enough," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>After all, he had already experienced the downgrading once. Staying in the Wall World left him feeling uncomfortable. It might be better to travel to the World of Nothingness.</p>

  <p>Compared to the grand way in which the third, fourth, and fifth-grade worlds were downgraded, the downgrading process of the Wall World had occurred in an extremely quiet and peaceful way. After all, there was no sound in this place.</p>

  <p>The materials that were placed within the Wall World began to gather and compress, bit by bit.</p>

  <p>They were pressed together proportionally.</p>

  <p>The distance between Luo Zheng and the Evil God was thirty miles. When the distance became shortened by half, the Wall World had also proportionally shrunk by half. The speed at which the Wall World's downgrading happened far exceeded those of the third, fourth, and fifth-grade worlds.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, the distance between Luo Zheng and the Evil God shrank to only seven and a half miles. By then, only one fourth of the Wall World was left.</p>

  <p>As the materials within the Wall World were pressed together, so were Luo Zheng and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Although these materials had been crushed and reduced in size, they still contained strength. To Luo Zheng and the Evil God, the strength of ordinary materials was nothing, and naturally it had no effect on the two of them.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrading of the Wall World was accelerating, and the speed of its shrinking was also accelerating.</p>

  <p>Another five minutes later, only a distance of one hundred and fifty feet was left between Luo Zheng and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Wall World shrank to 1/300th. The materials compressed tightly, but Luo Zheng and the Evil God could still easily withstand the pressure.</p>

  <p>Another five minutes slipped away.</p>

  <p>It had shrunk to 1/30000th its normal size now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Evil God were now in a close proximity to each other.</p>

  <p>The Evil God shifted a little, pushing away the tightly squeezed materials that surrounded him, and he moved in the direction of Luo Zheng's spikes.</p>

  <p>The two of them no longer had any intention of continuing their fight, and they were only hoping that they could finish the last journey with a tacit understanding.</p>

  <p>The Wall World had further shrunk to 1/300000th now.</p>

  <p>The materials in this world were now densely compressed. The extreme pressure changed the nature of these materials, and the temperature rose rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Can you withstand in such a form?" the Evil God suddenly questioned Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied with an indifferent shrug, "You'd better keep your concern for yourself."</p>

  <p>As the pressure increased exponentially, Luo Zheng drew on the surrounding energy to fortify himself.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Wall World shrank to 1/30000000th, and the pressure increased yet another hundredfold.</p>

  <p>Cracks began to form on the surface of Luo Zheng's body, from which tiny fragments sifted down, only to instantly melt. The temperature of the Wall World had increased explosively.</p>

  <p>Like Luo Zheng, the Evil God's body was almost imperceptibly collapsing.</p>

  <p>However, given that they had the aid of infinite energy, the two of them were not too concerned about their physical bodies.</p>

  <p>Never mind the cracks on their bodies, even if they were reduced to ashes, they could instantly heal themselves.</p>

  <p>When the Wall World shank to 1/300000000th, the pressure increased by another factor of ten.</p>

  <p>The materials of the Wall World were undergoing a strange change.</p>

  <p>Originally, while the properties of these materials had changed, they had still maintained their original colors. Now, all of them had turned a grayish brown, the same uniform color as the gray soil.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng and the Evil God were finally entering the area covered by the spiritual sense of the downgrader.</p>

  <p>He had been waiting at the center of the Wall World. When he sensed the two of them, he immediately and excitedly projected his spiritual sense, saying, "Finally, you are here. I'm wondering how you will feel when you are crushed into pieces."</p>

  <p>"This amount of pressure is hardly enough," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..." The downgrader laughed merrily. "The process of downgrading is the procedure of pressure becoming infinite. I wonder if your infinite energy can resist the infinite pressure. I'll now watch you being crushed bit by bit..."</p>

  <p>While he was speaking, a sharpened spike shot towards him.</p>

  <p>Even in this world of high pressure and high temperature, the spike could still travel at an incredible velocity, and it instantly impaled the downgrader, who was in the black light.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The flames loaded within the spike exploded and quickly engulfed the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader let rip with a painful scream. He was killed yet again by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"It's really rare to meet such a loquacious good-for-nothing." As the Evil God responded, he turned around and pointed the next sharpened spike at the black light, ready to slay the reborn downgrader at any time.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he feared being killed by the Evil God again, or perhaps he felt afraid of the pain that came before death.</p>

  <p>For the first time, the downgrader was silent upon his rebirth. He watched the downgrading process with a muted expression.</p>

  <p>The world shrank to 1/3000000000th now.</p>

  <p>Under the extreme pressure, Luo Zheng's body collapsed from the outside to the inside.</p>

  <p>His body couldn't maintain its shape, and it was quickly assimilated into the outside world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng acted quickly, abandoning the outermost layer of his body and creating a slightly smaller body inside.</p>

  <p>But as the slightly smaller body couldn't withstand the pressure, he quickly created a third body.</p>

  <p>The methods the Evil God used were almost the same as Luo Zheng's. The newly created bodies resembled the layers of an onion.</p>

  <p>Their bodies were shrinking smaller and smaller, and therefore, the pressure they could withstand was greater and greater.</p>

  <p>But this was only a delay tactic.</p>

  <p>When the world shrank to 1/30000000000th, the pressure increased another ten times.</p>

  <p>The bodies of Luo Zheng and the Evil God had both shrunk to the size of a silk bean. Under such immense pressure, they couldn't even release their spiritual senses. The two of them were confined to a space the size of a silk bean, and they struggled to hold on.</p>

  <p>The world shrank to 1/300000000000th.</p>

  <p>Under this massive pressure, there was no material that could maintain a stable state. All the materials had been transformed into pure energy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Evil God were no exception to this. Their bodies turned into energy, and then they gravitated towards the center of the Wall World.</p>

  <p>There existed an unknown point of origin, which was the root of the World of Nothingness.</p>

  <p>The point of origin was available to all.</p>

  <p>1/3000000000000th.</p>

  <p>1/30000000000000th.</p>

  <p>1/300000000000000th.</p>

  <p>In the end, everything within the Wall World was completely devoured and consumed by the point of origin, including both the black light and the downgrader within it.</p>
