<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The last time when Les wanted to kill Zheng straight, Claire rejected him.</p>

  <p>Now that she knew that they could never win Zheng over, she no longer tried to dissuade Les from doing what he wanted.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that I can't leave now, or I would go to the Grand Pure Realm and burn this guy into ashes," Les muttered.</p>

  <p>A few thin lightning bolts clashed with each other as he spoke, which was why his voice seemed laced with the sizzling noise of electric currents.</p>

  <p>"We're just watching, but doing nothing?" Claire deadpanned.</p>

  <p>As the three backbones of the Element Spirit race, the three of them occasionally received reinforcements.</p>

  <p>Those reinforcements also helped them improve their strengths over the years.</p>

  <p>They couldn't leave on their own will as of now, and couldn't go to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I can't get in touch with the Eye Spirit recently. He should have entered the Jade Pure Realm again. It's a bit tricky now..." Claire said with a frown.</p>

  <p>She had no hesitation in her the moment she decided to kill Zheng. After all, she didn't pity him, though she genuinely wanted him to be on their side.</p>

  <p>"Then let the warriors from other races on the Grand Pure Realm do something first," Slade suddenly suggested.</p>

  <p>"Warriors of other races?" Les asked. He didn't understand what Slade was talking about.</p>

  <p>"Mark and offer a reward," Claire said with a nod.</p>

  <p>The two Shadow Warriors listened to Slade's orders, while he formed good relationships with many warriors from various races on the Grand Pure Realm under the Eye Spirit's instruction.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, every race on the Three Purities Stage had their unique theurgies and powers.</p>

  <p>An ordinary Eternal Realm warrior who explored the Grand Pure Realm which was the outermost part of the Three Purities Stage was already like a person treading on immensely thin ice. Any warrior from the many races on the Grand Pure Realm was automatically their deadliest opponent.</p>

  <p>However, the Element Spirit Civilization had been in the Three Purities Stage for so many years. Although they couldn't subdue all of the races on the Grand Pure Realm, they could still have good relationships with them, as well as exchange interests and make deals with them.</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter...</p>

  <p>At that moment, Slade, who had an armor-like body, suddenly stretched out his hands, and then a white beam of light spread out. At the same time, different treasures appeared one after another.</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to make those guys obedient. Offering them the Ghost Tendon? That does not sound good enough. The Dead Sea Glaze? Too unpopular..."</p>

  <p>Various treasures flew past the white light in succession.</p>

  <p>Even Claire and Les couldn't help but eye the treasures with slight interest.</p>

  <p>That was because the Eye Spirit collected most of them. The Eye Spirit usually stored a considerable amount of treasures inside Slade's body.</p>

  <p>After all, Slade was not an individual. He could be likened to a city that could move. It was just that members of the Element Spirit race lived in the city. Thus, his current actions represented the decisions of all the members of the Element Spirit race in the city.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll just use this one…"</p>

  <p>In his glowing hands floated some ordinary bone fragments that were about the size of a thumb.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the bone fragments, Claire and Les looked skeptical.</p>

  <p>"The Bone Fragments Secret Soul?"</p>

  <p>"It's too precious. Will the Eye Spirit even agree?"</p>

  <p>The two of them understood that Slade represented the Element Spirit Civilization's Board of Elders to a certain extent, and he had greater rights than Claire and Les. The Eye Spirit usually did not object to any decisions he made.</p>

  <p>"That Zheng is quite powerful. The warriors of the other races on the Grand Pure Realm are not idiots. Only a great reward will make them brave," said Slade.</p>

  <p>Although Claire and Les felt sad at the thought that such a great treasure had to go, they could not interfere.</p>

  <p>Once Slade made a decision, he wouldn't change his mind, let alone consider what the two of them thought.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>When the white light in his hand flashed, he said towards the ice piece,</p>

  <p>"Shadow Warriors!."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!" the Shadow Warriors in the ice piece answered.</p>

  <p>"Mark Zheng," Slade ordered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>In turn, the two Shadow Warriors stretched out their hands towards Zheng simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Then, two rays of light intersected with each other and formed a distinct mark on Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng suddenly felt something as he ran. He turned his head and glanced at the mark.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked. "Shadow Mark!" King Ieuan blurted out.</p>

  <p>"What's it for?" "The Shadow Mark lasts for about five days after it appears.</p>

  <p>During that period, warriors from various races could find your location,"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan continued.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned deeply. "Can it be removed?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan shook its head. "No method can remove it," it said regrettably.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Mark was quite well-known in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>After the appearance of the Shadow Mark, the Element Spirit Civilization would offer a big reward to anyone who could do their bidding. Of course, almost all the warriors from the many races would be interested.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Shadow Mark would stay permanent for a few days. Even if one fled from the Other Shore, the mark still followed them.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others had also heard of it before, but this was the first time they had seen it. All their faces darkened.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as King Ieuan finished speaking, Zheng's ancestry-level bloodline started to fluctuate. A large, bloody mouth appeared on his back, which was quite near the Shadow Mark. The mouth bit towards it and swallowed it up.</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan looked at the scene, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin were also speechless.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the two Shadow Warriors that floated in the air looked at each other. They had no idea what had happened.</p>

  <p>"The Shadow Mark is something you can't touch, like those two Shadow Warriors. How did you swallow it?" King Ieuan couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>"Since you swallowed the mark, then that means you could also get rid of the two Shadow Warriors above, right?" the Snake Goddess also asked. A wry smile graced Zheng's face as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>In truth, the ancestry-level bloodline did things on a whim. Thus, he couldn't control it or make it do what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Next to the ice piece in the Supreme Pure Realm stood Slade, who already planned to share the location of the Shadow Mark with the various races.</p>

  <p>When the mark disappeared at such a critical moment, he naturally felt enraged. "Shadow Warriors, what are you doing?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"W...we... That Zheng had devoured the Shadow Mark!" one of the Shadow Warriors stammered. Clearly, he was immensely afraid of Slade.</p>

  <p>"He did eat it..."</p>

  <p>"I saw it too."</p>

  <p>Claire and Les still watched the ice piece. When they saw the big gap on Zheng's back, they were also baffled.</p>

  <p>"We can mark the people around him!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's a good idea!"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for Slade to give the order, the two Shadow Warriors once again summoned Shadow Marks.</p>

  <p>This time, they aimed at the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Shadow Marks appeared on the two Eternal Realm warriors' backs almost at once.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw that the Shadow Marks appeared again, he tried to remove them for the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but the ancestry- level bloodline sensed that the marks were none of its business. It did not even fluctuate in the slightest, and entirely ignored them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the marks had formed completely, the white light in Slade's hand began to spiral. At the same time, a circular white vortex also appeared on the ice piece.</p>

  <p>Several large non-human races in the Grand Pure Realm had a huge ice piece inside their places. At this moment, white vortexes also rolled in the center of these ice pieces.</p>
