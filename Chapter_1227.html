<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The person playing the zither was none other than Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>She had been missing Luo Zheng terribly ever since he had left. She didn't care about becoming his wife; her biggest wish was to stay by his side.</p>

  <p>Even when Brent, who had also disappeared for a long time, had come to Oracle City after the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been rebuilt and offered to take her back, Mu Ning had turned him down.</p>

  <p>She wanted to wait for Luo Zheng here. That way, if he returned, she would at least be able to see him as soon as he came back.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning hadn't returned to the Ethereal Spirit Sect. But the World Commercial Alliance had contributed quite a bit to help rebuild the sect because of her.</p>

  <p>The relationship between the World Commercial Alliance and the Ethereal Spirit Sect was by no means strained. And even though Mu Ning was a delicate woman, her strength had skyrocketed after she had activated the Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>Even though she was only at the Internal Elixir Realm right now, she was strong enough that she could be counted as one of the top three warriors in the Central Region, thanks to the power that she drew from the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>On that particular day, Mu Ning had summoned countless huge swords and killed countless warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect. That scene was still fresh in everyone's mind. If Luo Zheng was key to fighting the Heavenly Evil Sect, then it could be said that Mu Ning was the second most important person.</p>

  <p>But Mu Ning was not as well-known as Luo Zheng, and a majority of the warriors did not even know how the huge swords had appeared. Other than a few strong warriors, most people did not know that there was such a powerful woman in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>That was because Mu Ning had been spending most of her time in the Heavenly Stellar Palace. She could tolerate each passing hour, but her longing for Luo Zheng had been increasing with each passing day.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when she was in a good mood, she would instruct the servant girl to bring the unconscious Ning Yudie out to bask in the sun. She herself would concentrate on playing the zither, and this, more often than not, eased her yearning for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning heard footsteps behind her, she thought it was her servant girl, Faye. She had asked her to fetch the tea that she'd made, but there was no response from Faye. The string of the zither in her hand twisted slightly and her brow creased. Mu Ning was still the same old arrogant young miss; it was just that she would hide her true colors before Luo Zheng. She got angry when Faye didn't respond.</p>

  <p>"Faye?" Margaret's voice had an ominous ring to it. She twisted the zither string in her hand and it began to vibrate at her irritation. Her yearning for Luo Zheng was the reason behind her agitation.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you answering me?" Mu Ning asked angrily, her frown deepening. She pushed away the zither and turned around. She was not prepared for who was standing before her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at Mu Ning, a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Margaret's lips trembled and she took a few steps forward. Then she barreled on and threw herself into Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Half a year of being apart was just a few moments to a warrior, but to Mu Ning, it had felt like an eternity.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning didn't close her eyes when she enjoyed Zheng's warmth. Then she found Dorothea, who was standing behind him.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was a scheming woman, but she was willing to change for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter how many women he had, she wouldn't show any dissatisfaction. But that didn't mean that she didn't have any thoughts.</p>

  <p>She sized Dorothea up secretly.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was only at the Internal Elixir Realm, but she could feel a strong Mu Ning emitting from Dorothea. This was not soul pressure, but the unique Mu Ning of a powerful warrior. She wasn't sure what kind of strength Dorothea possessed, but she knew that she was very strong.</p>

  <p>But Mu Ning didn't care whether Dorothea was a strong warrior or not.</p>

  <p>She only wanted to be Zheng's woman.</p>

  <p>'Is this woman from one of the four divine kingdoms?</p>

  <p>She came all the way to the Central Region with Luo Zheng. Is she also his woman?</p>

  <p>But she is looking at me so strangely, ' Mu Ning thought to herself.</p>

  <p>As Mu Ning rested her head on Zheng's shoulder, her gaze met Dorothea's.</p>

  <p>There was no woman in this world who would be willing to share her loved one with other women. Even if Mu Ning had taken the initiative to take care of Ning Yudie, she was still jealous of Ning Yudie from time to time.</p>

  <p>She'd rather sleep like Ning Yudie as Luo Zheng ran all around the world for her.</p>

  <p>Dorothea seemed to be looking at Mu Ning strangely, which made Mu Ning feel like she was being sized up by a man instead of a woman.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Mu Ning was at a loss for words. 'What is going on?</p>

  <p>What is wrong with her?' she thought, confused.</p>

  <p>How would Mu Ning know that Dorothea was gay? And that she was looking at Mu Ning because she thought that Mu Ning was rather appealing.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning felt uneasy at Dorothea's relentless stare. She glared back fiercely at Dorothea before pulling her hair to the side and blowing out a breath of warm air towards Luo Zheng, hugging him tightly.</p>

  <p>At this, Dorothea burst out into laughter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently stroked Margaret's hair, and turned to look at Dorothea asking curiously, "What are you laughing at?"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing. I just think your woman is very interesting," she answered, chuckling.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes. He pulled away from Mu Ning and said, "Let me take a look at Ning Yudie first."</p>

  <p>"Okay!" Mu Ning nodded and stepped aside, allowing Luo Zheng to walk up to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had been in a deep sleep ever since her life energy had been sucked dry by the Life and Death Wind. Although the servant girls in the Heavenly Stellar Palace had taken good care of her, she still looked haggard, now that her life energy had dried up.</p>

  <p>Dorothea slowly walked over to Ning Yudie and looked her up and down before asking Luo Zheng, "So you said that someone was waiting for your treatment? Is this her?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Dorothea's eyes swept over Ning Yudie once again and she exclaimed, "This woman's life energy has completely dried up." After a while, she shook her head and said, "No, not all. There is still a little bit left. This is weird.</p>

  <p>This usually happens when one reaches the end of their lifespan. But this woman isn't very old. It's very strange!"</p>

  <p>A person was like a bowl, and the bowl was filled with life energy. As a person grew older, that life energy would constantly be consumed, and at the same time, it would also be slowly replenished.</p>

  <p>But life energy began to deplete unceasingly after the Five Aging Processes, and it would stop being able to be replenished. Even with life crystals, one couldn't replenish the life energy because the bowl was broken.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie hadn't reached the Soul Sea Realm, so she wouldn't have experienced the Five Aging Processes. It was only when one's lifespan was near its end that the life energy in their body would dry up. Dorothea was really confused as to why Yudie's life energy had dried up when she was still so young.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng answered, "Her life energy was taken away by the Life and Death Wind from the Netherworld River."</p>

  <p>"The Life and Death Wind?" Dorothea blinked and laughed. "Are you kidding me? The Law of Causality contained within the Life and Death Wind would indeed corrode one's life energy. If she had really touched the Life and Death Wind, she would've been dead already. How could you have kept her alive? What's more, you can't even bring the Life and Death Wind from the Netherworld River."</p>

  <p>"It's a secret," Luo Zheng said with a cunning smile. Yudie's survival was also a part of the Heavenly Fragment's contribution, and it restrained the Law of Causality in the Life and Death Wind. Luo Zheng of course wouldn't explain too much to Dorothea. So he merely concentrated on doing his job. He took out a life crystal from his space ring.</p>

  <p>This life crystal was almost completely formed from life energy. The life energy within it was far more than that contained within a life stone.</p>

  <p>Dorothea's eyes lit up at the sight of the life crystal in Zheng's hand. "That's great!"</p>

  <p>Not just Dorothea. Everyone, including the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance outside the Heavenly Stellar Palace, had felt a strong life energy radiating from it when Luo Zheng had brought out the life crystal.</p>

  <p>The life crystal was rare even in the Upper World. However, Dorothea had originally wanted to say that it would be a waste to use it that way.</p>

  <p>But considering that Luo Zheng had obtained it, she felt that she was not qualified to speak.</p>

  <p>It was as if Luo Zheng was holding not a piece of ore, but a living creature that radiated a strong life energy in all directions.</p>

  <p>He placed the life crystal on Yudie's face and gently pinched it. The surface of the life crystal cracked, and Luo Zheng retracted his hand fast as lightning. The life energy was like a living thing and would enter the body of the nearest creature, and Luo Zheng was afraid that the life energy would enter his hand.</p>

  <p>A dense flow of life energy floated above Ning Yudie, twisting into all kinds of irregular shapes.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, the dense life energy seeped into Yudie's thin lips.</p>
