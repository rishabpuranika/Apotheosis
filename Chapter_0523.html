<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng's sword was coming at him with such mighty force, the old man felt a tinge of surprise.</p>

  <p>In fact, even if it had been some other master in his place, with greater powers at his disposal, he would also find Zheng's unfathomable, ingenious and seemingly basic movements of swordsmanship strange.</p>

  <p>This wasn't so because Zheng's abilities and moves were unbreakable. Even tactically the most sound of his moves would fail to make up for the enormous and undeniable strength gap that lay between the two.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng flicked the sword at him, the old man turned around with his short yet powerful stature to dodge the incoming attack. At the same time, he did something mentally and a short spear popped out of nowhere, lunging straight at Zheng's Streamer Sword.</p>

  <p>Clink!</p>

  <p>The pointed head of the spear collided with Zheng's streamer Sword and let out a crisp tinkling sound. Though neither of the two weapons stopped in their paths, the spear slightly sank down. The old man seemed surprised.</p>

  <p>Obviously, he hadn't expected that Zheng's long sword could contain such mighty force. His face darkened a little and he sneered as he injected a bit of grey-colored life vitality into his short spear. Now, he decided to beat back Zheng's sword by relying on his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng backed a few steps when faced with that force. Then, without taking a breath, he lunged at the old man with his sword once more.</p>

  <p>One strike, two strikes, three strikes, four strikes�</p>

  <p>Every move that Luo Zheng made was impeccable and his performance of basic swordsmanship was, perhaps, second to none. Unfortunately, such basic moves were of no use and his attacks were constantly deflected by the old man's life vitality.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was clouded. His level in the martial arts really was very low.</p>

  <p>Even though he excelled at swordsmanship, which had given him the confidence and the ability to win over the aged man's short spear, in this fight, his opponent didn't seem fazed about his talent in this area at all.</p>

  <p>What they were doing was equivalent to a skilled boxer fighting with a two-meter high giant of a man. In such a case, techniques failed to come into play.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't give up though. With each passing deflection, his strikes came fiercer than ever, exerting all his efforts. Beads of sweat began to form on his forehead.</p>

  <p>Women all tended to fantasize, and Mu Ning was no exception.</p>

  <p>She had fantasized about numerous scenes in which Luo Zheng was fighting, but never had she ever dreamed of the things she was witnessing in those moments.</p>

  <p>Her hand was firmly in Zheng's grasp, his grip unyielding. Her palm was wet with Zheng's sweat and with her own.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng's sword was fiercely whooshing forward and flashing brilliant silver streaks in the air, Mu Ning felt greatly delighted. Although she knew that Luo Zheng was not a match for the old man, she still felt surprised that Luo Zheng had grown and cultivated so fast. Today, he was developed enough to possess the strength to confront the old man.</p>

  <p>Half a year ago, Vale had suppressed him easily, and he was at the initial level of the Illuminating Soul Realm then. But today, Luo Zheng had the courage to battle against a master at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Mu Ning didn't mind the fact that she had been under house-arrest at the Burning Sky Palace the last several weeks. She was happy to see Zheng's growth and it had taken all the sadness and boredom off her mind.</p>

  <p>However, no breakthrough occurred in the fight even though a long time elapsed. Luo Zheng grew anxious, while the old man looked more at ease than ever before. The short spear had blocked all of Zheng's strikes. It was like a cage that firmly locked Luo Zheng within its control.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled with derision. He now had the situation under his control. Luo Zheng was still so young and he believed that he wouldn't be able to break the lock formed by his short spear.</p>

  <p>While the old man showed his smug face, Zheng's eyes flashed a hauntingly beautiful white light. A shadow of a figure rushed out from his body. At the same time, the Blood Drinking Sword sprang out from his space ring. Lily, freshly unleashed from inside him grabbed the Blood Drinking Sword before she reached her highest point and stabbed at the old man.</p>

  <p>All this happened so sudden and so fast that from the moment Lily took the sword to the time she directed the sword towards the old man, it seemed that time had not passed.</p>

  <p>As a master at the peak of Illuminating Soul Realm, the old man had a sharp sense. Even though he had used his short spear to lock Zheng's sword, he still had enough extra energy to mobilize his senses. He could handle anything at ease even at the mere rustle of a few leaves caused by someone stealthily approaching him.</p>

  <p>But it never occurred to him that a person would rush out from Zheng's body. This was incredible.</p>

  <p>More unsettling was the strong malicious Mu Ning that person was emitting.</p>

  <p>So the first reaction the old man had was not to attack, but to hold his short spear horizontally, trying to deflect Lily's stab.</p>

  <p>The problem was that his short spear was only a low-level fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>Even though he was at the peak of Illuminating Soul Realm, he had very few spears at his disposal, let alone a short spear equivalent to a middle-grade fairy weapon. It was considered highly difficult to obtain such weapons. However, Lily was no ordinary person.</p>

  <p>And what she held in her hands was a middle-level fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the cultivation technique Lily was utilizing in her attacks was a kind of malicious Mu Ning. It was, to use the common phrase, super-powerful.</p>

  <p>As soon as the sharp blade of the Blood Drinking Sword touched the wooden hilt of the short spear, there was a flash of red light and the low-level fairy weapon directly broke into two parts.</p>

  <p>The old man reacted quickly. At the very moment his short spear was broken, he immediately retreated a few steps back. But he was too slow compared to Lily, and the Blood Drinking sword still stabbed into his chest and drops of blood came out from the wound. The old man crazily fled backward, and Lily ran behind him in hot pursuit. She followed closely behind at a brisk, powerful pace, her pretty figure dancing every step of the way. She was determined to catch him and kill him.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Lily's dancing steps and movements seemed delicate but her swordsmanship was very powerful. However, even she was not a match for the old man. She had just happened to pop out and catch him off guard. After the latter had come back to his senses, Lily might not be able to withstand his attacks.</p>
