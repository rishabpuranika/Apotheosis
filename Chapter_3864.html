<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A hush fell over the skies. Suddenly, Gerald's eyes lit up with a green light.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In the Invisible Ship, a small dot of green light flew out of Zheng's body. It was no other than No. 9527, a soul fragment of Gerald.</p>

  <p>Back then, Gerald had been optimistic about Zheng. Now, he wanted to know if he had made the right choice.</p>

  <p>As the others of the Black Ship watched the green dot of light float out of the Invisible Ship, no one dared stop it.</p>

  <p>Although No. 9527 was just a weak soul fragment, the aura it emanated was the same as that of Gerald.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The green light dot rose steadily, soaring through the sky until it shot into Gerald's forehead.</p>

  <p>In Gerald's mind, he was surrounded in the middle by many brain masters, like a human emperor, awaiting No. 9527's arrival.</p>

  <p>When the green dot of light entered Gerald's head, No. 9527 emerged and stood in front of its master. Suddenly, No. 9527 did a very human thing: it bowed towards its master.</p>

  <p>"You are me," the master said confusedly. "Why do you use such etiquette with your own self?" No. 9527 remained silent. Gerald thought for a moment, then finally said, "You've been gone for a long time. Have you grown attached to your own consciousness?"</p>

  <p>To some extent, the soul fragment was also an independent individual.</p>

  <p>After being with Zheng for so long, No. 9527 had gradually developed its own personality.</p>

  <p>It even didn't want to go back to its master. In its own way, it wanted to be a special No. 9527, not just a soul fragment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Master," No. 9527 replied sincerely. "I... I want to leave you. For good."</p>

  <p>As soon as No. 9527 spoke this, the brain masters surrounding Gerald broke into indignant chaos.</p>

  <p>How dare a mere soul fragment ask to break away from its master's consciousness?</p>

  <p>In the brain world, this was an absolutely outrageous act. It was impossible for brain masters and soul fragments to be this individualistic!</p>

  <p>"You have made a great contribution and successfully assisted Zheng to the Eternal Realm. Spread yourself out before me," Gerald ordered. "Once I understand what has happened to you during this period of time, I can allow you to leave."</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, No. 9527 spread out itself.</p>

  <p>Countless fragments were instantly deciphered by Gerald. From Zheng's journey to the Source World, to the scenes of his encounters on the Other Shore, all of them were laid out before him.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, Gerald was grateful to see how No. 9527 was of great help to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng on his own was extraordinary, with the help of No. 9527, he was able to reach greater heights.</p>

  <p>However, as Gerald kept absorbing, he noticed that as Zheng advanced on the Other Shore, he no longer needed No. 9527 as much. So much so, that at some point, No. 9527 was practically negligible. Later, with the appearance of the Regal Jade Spirit and the Primeval Lord of Heaven, No. 9527 paled in comparison.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Gerald was astonished to see what Zheng had been through.</p>

  <p>When Zheng replaced the Element Spirit race to control the Blooming Jade Stage, he felt even more shocked.</p>

  <p>However, just as he felt like he couldn't be any more impressed, he reached the part where Zheng entered the Eternal Scroll Painting. He became more stunned!</p>

  <p>Although No. 9527 had kept silent and did not disturb Zheng when Zheng was in the painting, it roughly understood the communication between Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Through No. 9527, Gerald had seen the center of the scroll painting, and known about the Four Spirits Sect, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guesses.</p>

  <p>All this happened in the span of seconds. In the blink of an eye, Gerald had fully understood what No. 9527 and Zheng had been through together. He gently shut his huge eyes, and then opened them again slowly, as he felt conflicting emotions rage within him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's performance was completely beyond his expectations, and even beyond his imagination...</p>

  <p>Previously, Gerald had been a little hesitant, but at this moment, he no longer had any misgivings.</p>

  <p>"I understand now," Gerald's voice rang out in the air, and it was easily transmitted to the ears of all the creatures from over a hundred provinces, sounding very peaceful. "Let go of Zheng and retreat. Then we can forget what happened today."</p>

  <p>Hearing the choice of Gerald, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess immediately heaved a sigh of relief, while Yellow Thearch and the others looked on coldly.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the sky, Othniel said, "You still haven't figured out that in this world, we are..."</p>

  <p>But Gerald interrupted his persuasion directly. "Not another word. I've seen more than you know. I won't believe their words anymore."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A blue light flashed across Othniel's one huge eye.</p>

  <p>Instantly, his aura became menacingly strong.</p>

  <p>"You really want to fight with me?" Othniel asked once more.</p>

  <p>"I have only one condition," Gerald replied decisively. "Let go of Zheng."</p>

  <p>Just from studying No. 9527's memories, he had fully realized Zheng's importance to this world. His value was so great, and Gerald was willing to sacrifice his life if it meant keeping Zheng alive.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Othniel's single eye shook wildly.</p>

  <p>The concentrated power of space shook crazily in his eye.</p>

  <p>Othniel had the highest space authority in the chaos. Now that he couldn't reach a consensus with Gerald, he planned to exile him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Gerald was well aware of how great Othniel's power was. However, there was no way he was going to allow Othniel to exile him easily.</p>

  <p>Putting aside the Deleting Space, even if Gerald was only exiled into a corner of the chaos, it would still take him time to return to the Source World.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>As Gerald spurted toward Othniel, invisible space walls appeared and blocked his way.</p>

  <p>Each space wall was as strong as the boundary wall, but to Gerald, they were as fragile as glass. With ease, Gerald smashed each of them at a touch...</p>

  <p>Even though the space walls did no real damage to Gerald, it did slow him down momentarily.</p>

  <p>Before Gerald even had the chance to attack Othniel, Othniel's eye had already gathered enough space power. Without hesitating, he shot a thick blue light onto Gerald's body.</p>

  <p>Once the blue light disappeared, so did Gerald.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Othniel's laughter roared throughout the skies.</p>

  <p>Then, he shrank his body, from a huge god-like scale to that of a human.</p>

  <p>His appearance also transformed into that of Mount. This was the complete Mount.</p>

  <p>Next, Othniel appeared beside Yellow Thearch, and pulled at the air in front of him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, space itself seemed to warp and distort all over the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>He had pulled the important figures to his side.</p>

  <p>They included the Divine Farmer, who was currently a goat monster, Mahoney, the members of the Black Ship, and the Snake Goddess...</p>

  <p>They didn't see this coming. As space itself seemed to fold before them, they hadn't reacted before Othniel pulled them towards him.</p>

  <p>Then, Othniel stared at Zheng as he saw through the Invisible Ship. He felt as though he had stumbled upon an invaluable treasure. Stretching out his hand, he wanted to pull Zheng towards him, too.</p>

  <p>However, even under his pull, Zheng remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>His invincible space truth had no effect at this moment!</p>
