  <p>
</p>

  <p>Among the four sect leaders, the Bird Spirit King Sheehan was the fastest.</p>

  <p>He also had the most profound understanding of space.</p>

  <p>To the creatures of the main world, the Deep Space was an obscure and incomprehensible area.</p>

  <p>Many of them, including those of the Four Spirits Sect, had entered and explored the Deep Space. However, only Sheehan could explore it easily and effortlessly.</p>

  <p>He had once reached the unreachable depths of the Deep Space, making him the only one who could bring back the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King observed Sheehan's every move through the Limited Omnipotent Stone and he saw him flap his wings. "Sheehan is going to make a move," he warned.</p>

  <p>But Sheehan was too fast. Even if the Snake Spirit King watched his movement, he couldn't do anything to stop him. There was always a way to deflate other theurgies, but the winner was defined by speed.</p>

  <p>After the Snake Spirit King's alert, Sewell stood on guard. The next moment, they noticed wisps of purple light.</p>

  <p>Sewell felt a slight chill as a wisp of purple light swept past his body. He then saw a huge bird's claw appear in front of him.</p>

  <p>The claw disappeared quickly before his eyes. Sewell blinked, uncertain whether it was a phantom or not.</p>

  <p>At the next minute, an unforeseen force pressed down on them.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Three crevices of tens of thousands of feet long imprinted around Sewell.</p>

  <p>These were Sheehan's claw print. Sewell was then crushed into the depths of the ground, breaking his body into several pieces.</p>

  <p>Despite the ghastly power of Sheehan's claw, it couldn't kill a Treacherous Being without the help of the Light of Annihilation. Sewell's broken body parts wriggled like earthworms. They moved towards each other and slowly reconnected into a whole.</p>

  <p>Sewell couldn't avoid Sheehan's claw, neither could the Snake Spirit King beside him.</p>

  <p>After all, Sheehan's target was the Snake Spirit King. The purple light wrapped the Snake Spirit King and a strong force clashed unto him? it was Sheehan's huge body.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>Because of the impact, the Snake Spirit King recoiled in the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>The high water splashed into an enormous wave because of the Snake Spirit King's weight.</p>

  <p>After the Snake Spirit King retreated a full distance of about forty thousand feet, he stopped rolling as his thick snake tail pierced into the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>As a snake, he was weak in battle.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The purple light shone brighter from above. Sheehan slowly descended from the sky, revealing his complete figure.</p>

  <p>An overwhelming aura was released from Sheehan's body. His dark eyes reflected indescribable hatred from within.</p>

  <p>"Cornelius. You finally dare to come. I have been waiting for you,"</p>

  <p>Sheehan said through a loud and thunderous voice.</p>

  <p>The high frequency made the water in the whole Wine Basin vibrate, producing a series of ripples.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King raised his body and silently stared at Sheehan. He felt his opponent's undisguised intent of killing him.</p>

  <p>Within the four sects, the Monkey Spirit Sect was reckless and aggressive, the Human Spirit Sect was proficient in studying, and the Bird Spirit Sect was noble and peace-loving. Sheehan treated Kincaid, Cornelius, and Orlando as good friends.</p>

  <p>Even as the internal conflict of the Four Spirits Sect became fiercer through time, Sheehan still tried to maintain peace and order.</p>

  <p>He naively believed that as long as he tried his best, the four sects would be as united as they were at the beginning, and that they would altogether fight off one powerful race after another.</p>

  <p>In the Four Spirits Sect, Sheehan made the greatest contributions. He found the ancestry-level bloodline which was deemed to be the Four Spirits Sect's foundation, but he never claimed credit for himself or became arrogant. Instead, he selflessly offered his help.</p>

  <p>But his goodwill didn't bring peace, but more serious disputes.</p>

  <p>What he didn't expect was the Snake Spirit King would want to destroy not only the entire Four Spirits Sect but also the main world.</p>

  <p>When he entered the chaos and found out that the Snake Spirit King was to blame, Sheehan sank into hopelessness. He was overwhelmed by desperation as everything he upheld was shattered.</p>

  <p>This world was so ugly. The only way to purify it was to ruin everything.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King needed to pay the highest price!</p>

  <p>The purple light once again beamed from Sheehan's body. The area formed by the light belonged to him.</p>

  <p>This was the case in the chaos, the main world, and even the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>The space rules he conceived could be used in the spaces of all levels. His talent was indeed unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Sheehan disappeared again after the purple light circled the Snake Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>With two muffled sounds, Sheehan's sharp claw had quietly gripped the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He flew to the other side of the Wine Basin grasping onto the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>When these two huge creatures flew over the Wine Basin, their figures became invisible from anyone on the battlefield. Even Sewell who watched the Bird Spirit King was clueless about where they went.</p>

  <p>The battlefield in the Wine Basin was located in the southernmost area of the Jade Pure Realm. After flying at an incredible speed, Sheehan then landed at the edge of the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he tossed the Snake Spirit King out of the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Sheehan wished to destroy everything. The simplest way to kill the Snake Spirit King was to throw him into the Void Dust so that he would be swallowed alive.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Even as a Treacherous Being, the Snake Spirit King couldn't escape the devouring power of the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>The huge body of the Snake Spirit King squirmed desperately in the Void Dust, but after struggling for a while, he was consumed completely.</p>

  <p>After he was annihilated, Sheehan's brutal stare weakened a little.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was his biggest enemy, but killing him was not enough to satisfy him.</p>

  <p>Sheehan flapped his wings and the purple light floated to the other side.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to follow it, a ball suddenly appeared not far away.</p>

  <p>The ball rapidly expanded, producing a set of golden coordinates.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King slowly broke out from the golden coordinates. The Limited Omnipotent Stone on his forehead remained intact. After he emerged, the ball engulfed the golden coordinates and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"You... You didn't die?" Sheehan's eyes widened with confusion.</p>

  <p>"Hiss!</p>

  <p>You are stupid because you haven't awakened." The Snake Spirit King shook his head mockingly.</p>

  <p>To kill Treacherous Beings once and for all, their coordinates had to be destroyed. It was not a secret in the Jade Pure Realm, but Sheehan seemed to know nothing about it.</p>

  <p>"Well then, I'll kill you over and over until you finally die!" Sheehan roared, once again overcome by killing intent.</p>
