<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ten years ago, Luo Nian had made a name for himself in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>However, without warning, he then disappeared for three years.</p>

  <p>For the years that he went missing, people living on the continent all thought that he had already passed away. But the truth was that during the times that he was away, he had returned to the floating island to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Three years had passed and when Luo Nian returned, his cultivation base had dramatically increased along with his strength that had become more formidable.</p>

  <p>When he showed up again, everyone was shocked to see his progress. Most of the people started to guess who and what force were behind Luo Nian's improvement. To them, it was a mystery as to what kind of clan was able to cultivate such an amazing warrior.</p>

  <p>Now, the people didn't need to gossip around anymore. Luo Nian shocked the people when he called the man in front of him "Dad". Did it mean that this man at the Life and Death Realm was the one responsible for his growth and training.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as he was about to challenge the Heavenly Annihilation Demons, Luo Zheng, his father, came out to stop him. Feeling dejected, Luo Nian could not help but frown at his father's actions. This time, Luo Zheng had suppressed his own cultivation base to the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>He had to do it because if he revealed his true identity, then the people of the Heavenly Annihilation Sect would surely fear him and kneel down before him immediately.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Annihilation Demons! Wait and see! Be ready to fight when I come back!"</p>

  <p>After Luo Nian's voice trailed off, he and Luo Zheng traveled to a desolate place using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>"What is so important? It had better be more important than the demons that I was about to slay," Luo Nian said, pouting his lips out of dismay.</p>

  <p>Stretching out his hand, Luo Zheng showed his son two copper sheets both in the shape of an octagon.</p>

  <p>He got one of the copper sheets from the tomb in the Excellence City. The things left behind by the former leader of the Sword Light Palace contained nothing valuable except for this shiny copper sheet that had attracted his attention.</p>

  <p>When he poured the divine crystal's energy into the copper sheet, a map appeared on it with a note written in Sanskrit. But of course, Luo Zheng was not able to decipher it as he could not understand the language written on it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it was not until Luo Zheng saved the Ear Mouse and got the second copper sheet that he realized it was called the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>As the name suggested, these two copper sheets should be the keys that could unlock the gates of two places on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought that he could easily reach the Other Shore soon and that he would need the copper sheets by then.</p>

  <p>When Dorothy sent the Ear Mouse's Other Shore Key to Luo Zheng, she also told him that if he wanted to use the key on the Other Shore, he had to decipher the Sanskrit word in the key. If he wanted, she would help him.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace even hired some people to interpret Sanskrit words. However, it would take them several years or even over ten years before they could do it for him. Moreover, it would cost the Taiyi Heaven Palace a staggering amount of several million or over ten million divine crystals to make it happen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows raised as he heard Dorothy's words.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was a talented boy. In fact, he could decode the Sanskrit words in a glance, as if it were his native language. If he took a position in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, then he would likely be rewarded with a lot of money for his work.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng refused Dorothy's proposal and instead brought the two copper sheets back to his inner world.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are these?" Luo Nian asked as he carefully observed the two copper sheets in his hand. He only saw countless stripes instead of Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng cautiously stretched out his hand and took out a divine crystal from his space ring.</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian saw the pure energy in the divine crystal, his eyes widened in curiosity. Wanting to know more, he asked, "Whoa, what is that? The energy within is actually so amazing!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not blame his son for being ignorant about the divine crystal. In fact, he could still remember that he had the same expression on his face when he first saw it.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Luo Zheng gave the divine crystal a little pinch and carefully put its energy onto one of the Other Shore Keys.</p>

  <p>As soon as the energy touched the Other Shore Key, its lines began to slowly move in circles. Just like what happened during the first test conducted by Luo Zheng, a map emerged on the key.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Other Shore Key that the Ear Mouse gave him had the same reaction as soon as he poured the energy of the divine crystal into it.</p>

  <p>In an instant, two maps appeared along with two Sanskrit words that seemed like they were written in gold.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian could not contain his excitement upon seeing the golden words in person. However, right after he read both of the words, his excitement turned into confusion.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, the Sanskrit word on this copper sheet can be translated into the words 'Stage One' and some other strange sentences that I don't seem to understand..." Luo Nian said as he pointed at the copper sheet that the Ear Mouse gave to him.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, this copper sheet reads 'Stage Nineteen' and another long unintelligible sentence... Why can't I understand the whole of what's written in these copper plates?" Luo Nian stated further.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng furrowed his brows as he wanted to learn more.</p>

  <p>In a daze, Luo Nian shook his head and said, "I don't know. I've never seen such strange Sanskrit words. This could only mean that they are gibberish and don't contain any meanings."</p>
