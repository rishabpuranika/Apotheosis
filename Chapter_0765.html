<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 765 Small Circulation Killing Array </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng never spoke in absolute terms.</p>

  <p>When Imogen had inquired about it, he answered the same.</p>

  <p>'Eighty percent'? the same answer.</p>

  <p>The elders, clan leaders, and sect leaders present in the crowd looked at each other in silence. The sect leaders seemed persuaded.</p>

  <p>"Eighty percent! Ha-ha. Young people these days brag too much! Aren't you afraid the wind will cut off your tongue?" Emanuel sneered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng selectively ignored Emanuel's words, for he knew the fellow was just messing around.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to block Eddie's punch in the Martial Arts Contest by relying on the enchanted barrier. Eddie had not employed all his power at the time and Luo Luo Zheng had only changed a portion of the runes to stave off the attack.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, despite what Emanuel said, the other elders and sect leaders kept silent. They were not blind to what they had seen. They had witnessed the power of Luo Zheng's divine textures, and to see was to believe.</p>

  <p>"Then let's examine the effect of his sect-protecting array!"</p>

  <p>"If this sect-protecting array doesn't stop Eddie, we can still hand Luo Luo Zheng over then."</p>

  <p>"That's right, we can take it step by step. Luo Luo Zheng is Eddie's main target?"</p>

  <p>The elders communicated with each other through their life vitalities. In the end, they turned to leave.</p>

  <p>As the others left, Emanuel could only glare at Luo Luo Zheng before vacating the hall himself.</p>

  <p>After everyone had left, Luo Luo Zheng raised his head, looking into the distance. He smiled as he made a gesture at someone.</p>

  <p>Inside the Ice Palace, Ning Yudie? who was in closed-door cultivation? smiled brightly as a life vitality talisman ignited in her hands. "You already knew..."</p>

  <p>"Of course I know you are spying on me," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie rolled her eyes. "Why would I be bothered to spy on you?"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, you should thank me, shouldn't you? Now that we have appeased this group of elders!" Luo Luo Zheng laughed. "Still, you have to be careful of Emanuel. That man is very ambitious and may make trouble at a critical moment."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded. "Yes, I know."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly Ning Yudie had noticed Emanuel's ambition. He had contributed to half of the trouble the elders had made, for he was the one who kept adding oil to the flame. But the Zhuo Clan was a third-grade clan in the Cloudy City. Without a good enough excuse, it would be tough for Ning Yudie to get rid of him.</p>

  <p>"We have a limited amount of time. I'm going to put the sect-protecting array in place."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng carried over a pile of divine textures and told Felix the same. Felix's face immediately lit up with excitement. He had long been anticipating seeing the imposing sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>Suspended in the sky, Cloud Hall looked like a giant oval egg from a bird's-eye view. According to the rules, the 4, 903 runes had to be divided into three batches.</p>

  <p>"The sect-protecting array is arranged according to the Large Circulation Killing Array. However, it is only a miniature version of it and can be called the Small Circulation Killing Array," the cyan dragon explained as he helped Luo Luo Zheng with the directions.</p>

  <p>"Large Circulation Killing Array?" Luo Luo Zheng was stunned at the name he heard.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's one of the three mighty arrays of the era. The other two are the Immortal Killing Array and the Sun Flame Array," the cyan dragon said slowly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was even more surprised at this. "Three mighty arrays? Is the Grand Marvelous Array not in the list?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Although the Grand Marvellous Array is formidable, the three great miraculous arrays are used to protect?" The cyan dragon paused for a moment, soon continuing, "Of course, the Small Circulation Killing Array is only an imitation of the Large Circulation Killing Array. I'm afraid it doesn't even have one-billionth of the latter's power, but it will serve well to be used as the sect-protecting array in the Central Region."</p>

  <p>Although the cyan dragon did not finish what he was about to say, Luo Luo Zheng committed the names of these three miraculous arrays to memory.</p>

  <p>After arriving at the first location, Luo Luo Zheng placed a divine texture on the ground and infused life vitality into it, immediately activating the divine texture. It glowed with brilliant light before the rune burst into fire. As the paper carrying the rune went up in flames and turned to ashes, the divine texture was left behind as if carved into the ground.</p>

  <p>Felix followed Luo Zheng's instructions and began to arrange the divine textures.</p>

  <p>The steps for laying them down were the same as the ones involved in arranging the runes, so it wasn't a difficult task for Felix and the other assistants.</p>

  <p>The first divine texture, the second divine texture, the third divine texture?</p>

  <p>Divine textures appeared one after another in every corner of the Cloud Hall. They seemed to be spread out randomly, but they were all placed in the corresponding directions.</p>

  <p>After they put the divine textures in place, two stewards of Internal Elixir Realm carried an array plate as tall as a man over to Luo Luo Zheng. The enormous array plate was also constructed by professional craftsmen, to be used in controlling the divine textures.</p>

  <p>It took half a day to finish the setup of the divine textures in the first zone.</p>

  <p>Immediately, they went on to arrange the divine textures in the second and the third zones as well. Luo Luo Zheng, together with Felix and the other assistants, shuffled back and forth above the Cloud Hall speedily.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had finished setting up the forty-nine hundred divine textures, he set up the three five-star divine textures. Once he had used the array plate to record their positions, the placement of the Small Circulation Killing Array was finally over. This marked the end of nearly a month's tedious work. The next step was to test the sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>That day, the weather was good and the vast sky was clear. The clouds that surrounded Cloud Hall all year round had suddenly disappeared without a trace. Standing above Cloud Hall, one could relish a complete view of Cloudy City. The tens of millions of its civilians too could see Cloud Hall, which to them was the palace of 'immortals', a sight to behold whenever they looked up.</p>

  <p>Above the Cloud Hall, dozens of elders and clan leaders were positioned in the air, seemingly waiting for something.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was on their side, quietly floating in the air. She watched Luo Luo Zheng and Felix as they made the last adjustments and prepared the array for testing.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" Ning Yudie asked them.</p>

  <p>"All the life vitality crystals are in place." Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The power of the divine textures arose from the materials in the ink, but it still needed the energy from the life vitality crystals to activate it.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Luo Zheng was slightly nervous. 4903 runes, and no mistakes were to be allowed in any one of them, otherwise the entirety of the sect-protecting array would not work.</p>

  <p>He took a deep breath and gently moved the array plate. As the array plate rotated slowly, beams of light began to flicker above Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Even the sunlight could not outshine the radiance of the runes.</p>

  <p>The first divine texture lit up, then the second, followed by even more of them glowing up.</p>

  <p>Under the control of the array plate, the luminosity of the runes merged into each other to emit a single sharp beam of bright light. From afar, it looked like a giant divine texture. At the center of the divine texture, a blue lightning bolt suddenly emerged out.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The 'Thunder Wrath' had been activated!</p>

  <p>A thick bolt of lightning flashed past the runes like a giant dragon soaring into the skies. The power it emitted was unquestionably terrifying.</p>

  <p>As the thunder disappeared, a streak of lightning could be seen flickering on the spot.</p>

  <p>"There is no problem in the first area," Luo Luo Zheng said as he turned the array plate again.</p>

  <p>In the second location, mists could be seen surrounding the place. The 'Mad Trap' was buried here. Things looked normal in this area before it was triggered. But as the over one thousand divine textures lit up, they quickly calmed down and returned to the normal state. The 'Mad Trap' had worked successfully.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng turned the array plate again, the divine textures in the last spot lit up.</p>

  <p>As the runes lit up, a bit of vapor appeared in the sky? a sight that was incredibly strange. Under the sunlight, the vapor transformed into a beautiful rainbow.</p>

  <p>The clouds of water vapor condensed together, forming a large enchanted barrier in the sky. The barrier was like a huge bowl, encasing the entire Cloud Hall within it. It was the defensive barrier of the Small Circulation Killing Array, the 'Light of Water', a most important safeguard.</p>

  <p>A gust of cool breeze swept past everyone. They could see countless ripples appear on the surface of the enchanted barrier above their heads.</p>

  <p>"It is just a big bubble. I'm afraid it will burst with a single gentle touch.</p>

  <p>How can it stop Eddie? I don't think it could even withstand my spear!" an elder spoke as he flew to the edge of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>A black spear materialized in his hand. He aimed it at the barrier and began to form the spear intent.</p>

  <p>The elder shouted and charged at the enchanted barrier with the spear. The burst of energy of the Virtual Tribulation Realm was awe-inspiring.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The spear collided with the surface of the enchanted barrier but only produced ripples on its surface. Other than that, nothing happened. Looking at the scene, the elders were both surprised and pleased.</p>
