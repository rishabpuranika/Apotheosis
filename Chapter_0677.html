<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In fact, they weren't as excited to fly into the Upper World. On the contrary, what they truly wanted was to gain possession of the arena and simply prepare for themselves an easy way out.</p>

  <p>The stronger the warriors had become, the more terrified they were of death. Despite the fact that they lived a long life, they would still have to die at some point. Time, much like a sharpened knife, would be the enemy who would end up giving them a fatal blow at the final moment of their lives.</p>

  <p>Meaning to say, as soon as they reached the moment when they started feeling as though they had one foot in the grave already, they would go to great lengths to seek treasures, desperate to extend their lives by any means possible, or even dive into the jaws of death just to reach the Kingdom of God and train themselves.</p>

  <p>If they, for whatever reason, failed to get a breakthrough in their training, they could still place their hopes and dreams on the Upper World and look for chances to make a breakthrough. That was precisely the way of thinking of most of the strong men at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>"There you have it. So, can I go now?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, tipping his head and looking over at Dillon.</p>

  <p>Dillon just bobbed his head and said, "Given that the dilemma of the Dragon Soar Arena has been solved without a hitch, I don't think there's anyone who could stop you in Oracle City."</p>

  <p>The strong men at the Virtual Tribulation Realm who were silently watching simply chose to pay Luo Luo Zheng no heed. The fact of the matter was, to embarrass an innocent young man at the Illuminating Soul Realm wasn't an honorable thing to do. Be that as it might, the problem of the arena was just a little too complicated that they ran out of other options and had to do it.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie, glaring at Luo Luo Zheng with a grim expression, huffed in revulsion, and took off.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, wearing an aggrieved smile, went after her without delay.</p>

  <p>"What reason could you possibly have for fixing the arena?" Ning Yudie channeled her indifferent voice to Luo Luo Zheng through her life vitality, akin to that of a cold breeze whistling.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but laugh and answered sincerely by also using his life vitality, "All of that is a lie!"</p>

  <p>"A lie? You mean a trap?" Ning Yudie was at such a loss for words. Knowing Luo Zheng's personality to such a great extent, she was certain that he wasn't someone who would do something to benefit those he didn't know. For that very reason, she just couldn't wrap her mind around his motive for fixing the rune.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng appeared as though he had been deep in thought for a moment before going on and stating, "The arena is actually connected to the Genuine Dragon World. That is also the location where the Dragon Lineage Human resides. Any human without Genuine Dragon blood running through their veins will be imprisoned for a thousand years."</p>

  <p>"What? What did you say?" Yudie's jaw dropped as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng in utter disbelief. "Is that true? Are you serious?"</p>

  <p>"Mm-hmm." Luo Luo Zheng nodded in response.</p>

  <p>Those who did not possess Genuine Dragon blood in their bodies would be imprisoned for 1, 000 years.</p>

  <p>Even those strong men at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were able to live for over a thousand years. Raven had already been living for more than 400 years as of the moment. If he were to rise up above toward the Upper World, it was highly likely that he would die there!</p>

  <p>"But how on earth were you able to come back here from the Upper World?</p>

  <p>This doesn't make any sense at all!" Ning Yudie threw in her question out of confusion. Her otherwise perfectly sculpted eyebrows had been knitted all of sudden because of that.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, as luck would have it, was able to avoid the imprisonment of a thousand years with the aid of the cyan dragon, but there was no way in hell he could tell Ning Yudie the truth as easy as that.</p>

  <p>He was deeply moved with Ning Yudie defending him just now. With that in mind, he spoke softly, "It's not something we should be discussing out in the open. Let's go somewhere safe."</p>

  <p>Taking into consideration the fact that the Martial Arts Contest was about to begin, a lot of the elders with elongated ears in the Central Region had gathered in Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie bobbed her head in agreement and said, "Understood. Follow me."</p>

  <p>Consequently, Ning Yudie led the way as the two of them flew all the way into an opulent palace in Oracle City. As one might expect, it was constructed by the World Commercial Alliance to accommodate VIPs. Ning Yudie, evidently, was a VIP.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng stepped foot inside the palace, Ning Yudie waved her hand over to him, and a huge snowflake pattern materialized on the ground. As it expanded, an enchanted barrier emerged to envelop them.</p>

  <p>"Now, no one will be able to eavesdrop on our conversation in here. Be honest with me. You mentioned that the warriors who flew into the Upper World would beyond doubt be imprisoned for a thousand years. How did you make your way back here?" Ning Yudie queried.</p>

  <p>Grinning from ear to ear, Luo Luo Zheng brought out a little container he got from the space ring and tossed it over to Ning Yudie. "As stated by the rules of the Dragon Lineage Human, every human who has a drop of Genuine Dragon blood in their system shall become one of them. Take this. This one is for you!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie examined the bottle, inside of which was a drop of blood pulsating rhythmically. In spite of the fact that she was rather capable and well-informed, she gulped instinctively struggling to come up with a response.</p>

  <p>"So, you're telling me this is what Genuine Dragon blood looks like?"</p>
