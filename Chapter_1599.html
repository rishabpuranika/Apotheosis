<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1599 Near-death Situation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng was dragged into the darkness, he had already thought of this and anticipated a way out.</p>

  <p>He had used the powerful assault of Hailey as his cover. Although the energy released by the Moon Bursting Flame Bow was exceedingly strong, Luo Zheng's body was left unharmed as it was immune to flames.</p>

  <p>With their full cooperation, as long as the other party dared to hook onto him, he was confident that he could kill the enemy!</p>

  <p>The one who killed their enemy wasn't Luo Luo Zheng, so the Illusion Points that bolted out from the body of the warrior who had been burnt to ashes just now directly flew into Hailey's body.</p>

  <p>However, the most surprising thing was that the ace talent in the other party was also able to resist the attack from the Moon Bursting Flame Bow. He faced the flames head-on and outrageously rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng, ready to kill him as well!</p>

  <p>Within a split second, this person charged in full momentum, aiming his long sword in his hand towards him. However, before it reached him, Luo Luo Zheng had already sensed the peculiarity of that iron sword.</p>

  <p>It looked old and quite too ordinary, merely like a conventional weapon that even didn't deserve to be ranked. But Luo Luo Zheng had this nagging feeling stating otherwise, giving him an immense pressure at that particular moment!</p>

  <p>If he were to be struck by this sword, he would most likely die beyond a shadow of a doubt!</p>

  <p>At the time this thought occurred to him, a long hook caught Luo Luo Zheng and quickly pulled him backward.</p>

  <p>"Bring him back!" The dark iron sword's order was almost overbearing to the extent of it being unquestionable.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Not even a full second of time, Lone hurled his long hook at Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>He just as much wouldn't allow Luo Luo Zheng to kill someone in front of him and then openly slip away!</p>

  <p>And like a bolt of lightning, the long hook in his hand brutally launched towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the instant, his long hook reached Luo Luo Zheng, a clinking sound reverberated.</p>

  <p>Janet's long hook was already on Luo Luo Zheng when Lone's long hook also got him.</p>

  <p>Under the collision of these two completely identical laws, Janet's hook was directly knocked away, and similarly, Lone's long hook was also knocked off. It was like there was a repelling force surrounding them.</p>

  <p>Having lost both of the shackles of the long hooks, Luo Luo Zheng was unable to fly. He had nothing to rely on to gain momentum in the air.</p>

  <p>Consequently, his entire body fell directly into the deep ditch!</p>

  <p>Briefly, he happened to glance at the multicolored river of energy slowly flowing within this deep ditch.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Hall of Causality, these seemingly harmless energies were absolutely fatal. If anyone were to fall into the river, the warrior would undoubtedly die, and there was no exception to it.</p>

  <p>And for Luo Luo Zheng, it was indeed unexpected!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained alert at this ordeal as there was no trace of panic on his face. After all, no one died in the Illusion Battlefield for real. Everyone could still see that Luo Zheng's expression was extremely calm. And before he fell, he threw the long hook in his hand at Lone.</p>

  <p>The attacks of these several hooks all happened simultaneously in an instant.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had begun to fall, Lone was still drawing back his long hook.</p>

  <p>Before he got his hook, Luo Zheng's long hook was one step ahead as it shot towards him!</p>

  <p>The first one to react was the sword in Lone's hand.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how fast the sword's reaction was, that response didn't come from Lone himself. Realizing that Luo Luo Zheng wanted Lone to perish together with him, the dark iron sword quickly sent a message through its consciousness to Lone.</p>

  <p>In the end, however, it was still a step too late.</p>

  <p>Or perhaps it could be said that the sword did not tell Lone what exactly happened. It only released a strong sense of danger to alert him.</p>

  <p>Even though Lone had detected the danger, it took him a moment before realizing that it was emanating from Luo Zheng's long hook, which had already caught him and was pulling him towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Currently, both of them were plummeting at the river of energy below.</p>

  <p>"This guy, is unforgivable!"</p>

  <p>Lone's sword roared.</p>

  <p>If the two of them plunged into the river, it would be the end of them, and they would be sent back to the main city for revival.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>This did not happen.</p>

  <p>At this critical stage, Jeffrey, who stood at the back, once again threw a long hook at Luo Luo Zheng, trying to pull him back from this deep ditch.</p>

  <p>The moment he made his move was timely perfect. The long hook in his hand securely caught Luo Luo Zheng, who was falling, and he quickly dragged him towards the side, which was covered by a dense fog.</p>

  <p>Lone faced the same dilemma. A martial artist behind him also threw a long hook. And to prevent him from plummeting further, he started pulling Lone back.</p>

  <p>Between the two, no one won in this round, since they had not even fought.</p>

  <p>Saved by his fellow man, Lone felt somewhat disgruntled. He refused to accept that the whole scenario ended up like this. Anger engulfed him as he threw the long hook at Luo Luo Zheng once again!</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng began to descend again, not long after he was pulled up! Lone's long hook hit against Jeffrey's hook, successfully disengaging it from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng braced himself as he was going all out. If he were to die in the Hall of Causality, he would have to pull someone down with him at all costs! Then in a split second, the long hook in Luo Zheng's hand also shot towards Lone, and with a crisp tinkling sound, the hook attached to Lone loosened up.</p>

  <p>Lone also started to sink downwards. But he abruptly twisted his body in the air to turn around. Then an uncontrollable ray of light, which was bursting with full energy, suddenly shot out from the dark iron sword and immediately charged towards Luo Luo Zheng with utmost urgency! Even though the sword had extracted Lone's life vitality, and its strength couldn't be fully displayed, its ray of light contained a profound intent, so its potency was naturally strong.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure moved slightly to the side as he drew his sword. Streaks of lightning and wind blades bursting forth from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword soon followed as if they were in sync with Luo Zheng's bodily movement, while at the same time, dozens of Nether God Shadows thrust towards Lone.</p>

  <p>Both of them were in a dire state, but they seemed to have chosen to ignore their critical situation. As they continued to cascade at a quickening speed, they were seriously utilizing their techniques to bring down the other.</p>

  <p>'This ray of light...' Luo Zheng's pupils dilated at the glaring ray of light. He had no way to dodge this attack. If this ray of light hit him, he would most likely die without a doubt.</p>

  <p>However, right at this moment, another long hook once again caught Luo Luo Zheng and stopped him from falling. He immediately twisted his body. With the help of the pulling force from the hook, he forcibly managed to dodge Lone's incomparable powerful strike.</p>

  <p>Lone's situation was similar to Luo Zheng's. Another long hook shot out from the darkness, once again dragging him towards another direction.</p>

  <p>With the assistance of both parties, Lone and Luo Luo Zheng had stabilized their position. Though they had the chance to return to their places, neither of them wanted to lose yet. After all, if one must fall into the river of energy, that warrior would most likely die.</p>

  <p>Their long hooks shot out once again!</p>

  <p>The two of them continued to descend and then were pulled up by the people behind them. At the same time, the two of them threw their hooks at each other and then continued to fall into the river of energy.</p>

  <p>This near-death situation lasted for a full seven rounds. They fell down seven times and were pulled up seven times. Both sides had knocked off each other's hooks for many times!</p>

  <p>Neither of them dared to keep their guard off, but Lone was also secretly shocked. This fellow in front of him looked ordinary, but he seriously possessed such strength! He admitted that he had underestimated Luo Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>Lone knew the strength of his sword, but even so, he was unable to gain anything from Luo Luo Zheng. Now, he was very anxious.</p>

  <p>Exactly at this moment, another flame exploded right above Lone's head!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>An intense Fierce Flame Explosion erupted and formed a wall of flames, separating the Dark Law from the outside. However, the warriors covered by the Dark Law had a hard time finding Lone through that layer of explosive flames.</p>

  <p>The two long hooks which were initially intended to rescue Lone failed to reach him. But instead, they flew past him and headed straight for Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Without any hooks dragging him, Lone fell straight into the river of energy in the deep ditch. Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was accidentally dragged by a long hook into the Dark Law on the other side.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng steadied himself, from the corner of his eyes, he saw Lone staring at him coldly, with eyes filled with killing intent and hatred as he sank into the colorful river of energy.</p>
