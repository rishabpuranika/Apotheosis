  <p>
</p>

  <p>Naturally, Zheng didn't know that such a change had happened in the North Mysterious City. As he continued to fly upward, the closer he got to one of the suns.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the huge ball of light above his head formed a strange reverse vortex of flames, as if the flames spurted out from it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the situation in his body was different.</p>

  <p>All the vortexes spun around and continuously absorbed the flames that came to his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the huge vortex before him and the small vortexes on his body, lost in thought. "Did those flames in the sun really come from Emperor Charm? Or did they come from somewhere else?" he asked.</p>

  <p>After all, he felt that the flames in the sun seemed to be from another space, while the vortexes in his body had pulled the flames into another space.</p>

  <p>Although neither his physical body nor the huge vortex in the sun had any spatial fluctuations, his sixth sense told him that it should be the case.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's question, Houyi and Emperor Charm glanced at each other and silently exchanged surprised looks.</p>

  <p>"The Nine-Sun World Destruction is my bloodline theurgy. How could it come from somewhere else?" Emperor Charm said with a grin.</p>

  <p>The sun continued to expand as Zheng looked at it in confusion. "It seems so, but it looks like the flames in the vortex are extracted from another place."</p>

  <p>"Don't they come from the Other Shore?" Houyi asked jokingly. However, Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. It doesn't contain any Other Shore Power," he said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's answer pleased Emperor Charm, who praised, "What a keen intuition!</p>

  <p>I remember that it had taken the Primeval Lord of Heaven dozens of chaotic eras to realize this."</p>

  <p>"This? What do you mean by this?" Zheng asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"The energy in the chaos doesn't come from it," answered Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"The energy in the chaos doesn't come from it…" Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He still found it hard to understand. "How is that possible? Do you mean that all of our power comes from outside of the chaos?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Emperor Charm confirmed.</p>

  <p>"But I wasn't able to see this before."</p>

  <p>"Because the level of energy is usually not high enough. If an energy has reached the level of the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy, then you'll be able to see it. That is why you can feel that the sun rotates," Emperor Charm explained.</p>

  <p>The energy that the mortals used to ignite a torch or the energy that warriors at the Other Shore Realm used to smash the mountains was related to the outside of the chaos, but those energies' level was still too low to be noticeable. However, when an energy's level had reached a certain point, the things that people could see would be different. It turned out that only after the qualitative change transpired could some things be visible.</p>

  <p>"The level..."</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng felt that Emperor Charm's explanation finally made sense. He did notice that feeling he mentioned just now!</p>

  <p>But what about his physical body?</p>

  <p>His physical body didn't release energy, but rather devoured energy. How could that be explained?</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that the Primeval Lord of Heaven was already considered an extraordinary talent because he had made such a hypothesis.</p>

  <p>It was even more impressive because at that time, he knew almost nothing about the chaos. He was like an ant that tried to calculate the height of the sky, but surprisingly, what happened later proved that he was right.</p>

  <p>That was also the reason why many human masters were willing to follow him.</p>

  <p>The discussion stopped while Zheng had gotten quite close to the first sun.</p>

  <p>The golden Sun Shooting Bow on his shoulder let out a series of sounds. It seemed to have its own consciousness and became excited.</p>

  <p>Although Houyi was the one who gave the Sun Shooting Bow, the bow was actually a part of the Civilization Artifact. Just like the Wing King's cyan feather, it was an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>A second later, Zheng pulled the longbow, clasped the string with one hand, and then skillfully drew it.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>He slid his fingers to the side, but did not pull back the thin bowstring.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the Chaotic Source Spirits' protection, the bowstring would've cut his fingers already.</p>

  <p>"Why couldn't I draw the bow?" he asked curiously. Houyi chuckled beside him.</p>

  <p>"You can't just casually draw the bow with only your strength!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Then what should I do?" asked Zheng. "Try again," Houyi answered.</p>

  <p>When Zheng drew the bow once again, Houyi mumbled something.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, streaks of golden light bloomed from his shadow and turned into a mark, which then imprinted itself on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The mark disappeared. As soon as it was gone, Zheng drew the bowstring for half a foot, but he couldn't draw it again after that.</p>

  <p>Then, Houyi recited the invocation once more. It seemed that the invocation was inherited from the 77th chaos, and each word from it was full of power.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The golden mark enveloped Zheng and disappeared again. When the golden mark vanished, the golden bow in his hand was pulled back a distance of another half a foot.</p>

  <p>The process repeated six times.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Sun Shooting Bow was fully stretched.</p>

  <p>Next, Zheng aimed at the huge sun not far away.</p>

  <p>However, it appeared that he didn't need to aim at it in such an angle. "Just release the bowstring?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Some powerful bows didn't need to be equipped with arrows, as the arrows would be condensed in the void.</p>

  <p>"I forgot to give you the Sun Extinguishing Arrow!" Houyi exclaimed and slapped his forehead.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the corners of Emperor Charm's eyes twitched slightly. He always felt that to lose to an idiot like Houyi was unforgivable.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng looked quite helpless, but there was nothing he could do since Houyi was a human master.</p>

  <p>Houyi stretched out his hand and gently waved the Sun Shooting Bow.</p>

  <p>Then, a golden arrow materialized in front of them.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Zheng drew the bow and the arrow was in place. He no longer hesitated.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>The Sun Extinguishing Arrow was shot towards the vortex!</p>

  <p>The Sun Extinguishing Arrow was completely different from what he had imagined. It didn't have the power to destroy the heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>It was like a rather ordinary arrow, and its speed wasn't even fast enough when he shot it. "Can the Sun Extinguishing Arrow really destroy the sun?" he asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>Houyi looked at him smugly. Before he could answer, Emperor Charm interjected and said, "Of course it can. It doesn't destroy the sun with greater power, but instead extinguishes it."</p>

  <p>According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's theory, the energy within the chaos did not come from the chaos, but from somewhere else.</p>

  <p>The suns' energy was the same.</p>

  <p>Now, Houyi's Sun Extinguishing Arrow was considered powerful because it severed the connection between two places and cut off the energy supply.</p>

  <p>As a result, Emperor Charm's theurgy was restrained.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Houyi's strength back then was far inferior to Emperor Charm's, but Emperor Charm couldn't do anything to him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Sun Extinguishing Arrow slowly flew to the center of the sun.</p>

  <p>Just then, a small black dot appeared.</p>

  <p>The small dot quickly spread out and spun within the vortex in the sun.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, the sun was extinguished.</p>
