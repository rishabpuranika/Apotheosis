<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It took them almost three days to cross the second supreme world.</p>

  <p>However, the third supreme world had only taken them a day.</p>

  <p>As time passed slowly, Yolande and Luo Zheng crossed different supreme worlds one after another. All the supreme worlds were occupied by humans and these were just one of their three great forces. It was easy to see how powerful humans were across the universe.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been busy with cultivation the whole time he was traveling swiftly.</p>

  <p>A month later, Luo Zheng felt the exquisite carriage finally stopped. He slowly opened his eyes and looked out of the window, seeing an orange crescent moon in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Here we are." Yolande pushed the carriage door open and walked out first.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed Yolande. He suddenly thought of something and asked,</p>

  <p>"Well, if Fenton wants to come here, how long will it take?"</p>

  <p>Thinking for a moment, Yolande replied, "He has to do it by his own if the Saint Lord of his sacred place doesn't help him. It should take about two to three hundred years for him to get here by himself."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was left speechless. That was a long time! Fenton was the pride of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Thus, the Saint Lord would surely not let him waste several hundred years of his time on such a trip. Moreover, crossing so many supreme worlds would require considerable expenses.</p>

  <p>Fenton would never be able to afford them.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. Once you're strong enough, you'll realize that the universe isn't as big as you first thought." Yolande continued walking ahead after speaking.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was left eyeing her from behind. Her colorful skirt was swaying beautifully and Luo Zheng couldn't help but slightly smile before he followed her.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, this Yolande gave Luo Zheng a very strange feeling. Her two clones that Luo Zheng had met before were too different from her in personality. Although he knew the reason for that, he still felt different for this Yolande. However, if he was to base his idea from their gracefully slender figure, Luo Zheng was sure that they were exactly the same person.</p>

  <p>They both saw a large city after some minutes of walking. To him, the Upper World cities were like giant behemoths. Each city was as vast as the Central Region. Thus, he didn't bother to check how big the city exactly was.</p>

  <p>He could see a giant stone pillar standing proudly within the city. It was so magnanimous that Luo Zheng could clearly see it even if he was hundreds of miles away. It must be tens of thousands of feet tall with a towering palace sitting on its top. The palace was like the crown of a large tree, spreading wide at the top of the pillar. It was not known how the palace was built.</p>

  <p>"This is one of the thirteen palaces, the Mist Palace," Yolande said.</p>

  <p>"Follow me in."</p>

  <p>Then she gently waved her hand, creating an invisible force that enveloped Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt his body flash in space once and in the next instant, he appeared in another place.</p>

  <p>It was spatial transference.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could travel in small spaces but the distance between him and the Mist Palace was too great. With just space traveling, Yolande brought him instantly inside the grandiose place. Only spatial transference could do that.</p>

  <p>It was just as Fenton said. In the Upper World, martial artists had to master the Space Law and the Time Law. It was obvious that Yolande's control over the Space Law was extremely profound.</p>

  <p>Thousands of steps welcomed their view as soon as they entered the Mist Palace. There was a soldier standing proudly in every three steps. In total, the whole stairs were guarded by hundreds of warriors. Each of them had reached the Soul Sea Realm, looking solemn as they stood in perfect posture.</p>

  <p>The soldiers bowed one by one to Yolande each time she stepped.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Yolande acted as if she wasn't seeing them and just continued to ascend.</p>

  <p>At that time, several rays of light appeared in the sky. In a matter of split second, they came from the horizon and appeared next to Yolande.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed that the person in the lead was a thin middle-aged martial artist. He had an aquiline nose and a pair of very sharp eyes which were as slender as willow leaves. Luo Zheng couldn't tell the cultivation of the man before him. However, he could sense that his Mu Ning was almost the same as Yolande's.</p>

  <p>"Is this man also a world lord?" Luo Zheng asked in slight surprise.</p>

  <p>"Master, I heard you were back, so I came to greet you." The man gave Yolande a light bow but there wasn't the slightest hint of respect in his voice.</p>

  <p>This confused Luo Zheng a little. Just as he understood it now, Yolande was the master of the Mist Palace, which was one of the thirteen palaces. How was it possible that the man wasn't respecting her?</p>

  <p>Yolande looked at the man and said in a cold voice, "There's no need to greet me. I still have things to do. You can leave now."</p>

  <p>The man touched his chin but didn't move away. Instead, he turned to Luo Zheng, sizing him up with interest. He then stepped forward and sniffed at Luo Zheng, chuckling. "Master, where did you find this guy? He smells like someone who has ascended to the Upper World. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked her eyes upon hearing the middle-aged man and stared at him. "So what?"</p>

  <p>The man snickered. "Nothing. It is just that I've never picked garbage.</p>

  <p>Do you want to see the two new martial artists I brought back this time, Master?"</p>

  <p>The moment he stopped talking, two young martial artists appeared behind him and looked at Yolande's direction. Their faces were hard, displaying how profound they were. They had just reached the Life and Death Realm, but like Fenton, they had also gone through nine small Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>Surely, the two of them did not dare to disrespect Yolande. However, their expressions immediately became disdainful when their gazes landed on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yolande sized up the two men, and then said indifferently, "Not bad. It seems that our Mist Palace has gained another two talents."</p>

  <p>The man laughed. "Of course. This is the son of the lord of the Great Circle World. When he was just born, his father used the power of the supreme world to clean up his hair and marrow. As for the other martial artist, he has inherited the blood of the Celestial Mouse. His Lotus Flower already has seven leaves. I estimate that after reaching the Soul Sea Realm, he will have the qualifications to join the Swallow Cloud House!"</p>

  <p>"Good," Yolande replied in a cold tone. It seemed that she did not want to talk with the man and was going to bring Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>However, the middle-aged man stopped her and continued, "Master, what is this guy capable of? Why did you personally bring him here? He must have powerful backing, right?"</p>

  <p>"I see! He's from the Lower World!"</p>

  <p>The two martial artists with extraordinary backgrounds interrupted hatefully.</p>

  <p>"I can smell the disgusting smell even from a few feet away!"</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, they were very respectful towards Yolande.</p>

  <p>However, they could tell that the man with an aquiline nose didn't respect Yolande and even went further to humiliate her. Thus, they started blaming Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yolande's beautiful face showed anger, but she seemed to fear the man with an aquiline nose, so she held herself back. She honestly didn't have any clue on how to explain what she did.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng chuckled and sniffed. He said, "Why don't I smell it?"</p>

  <p>One of them said mockingly, "If one stays in the salted fish shop for long, he won't smell the smell of salted fish. How can you smell your own smell?"</p>

  <p>"Oh." Luo Zheng sniffed again and said, "So that's how it is. You two probably won't be able to smell your own smell either!"</p>

  <p>"What smell do we have?" one of the martial artists asked aggressively.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know that you guys smell like idiots?" Luo Zheng said with a smile while covering his nose. "Although it isn't disgusting, it's bad enough.</p>

  <p>This is not a good place to stay for long."</p>

  <p>Yolande giggled upon hearing Luo Zheng. Although she knew that Luo Zheng was someone who wouldn't lose out, she hadn't thought that his words would be so incisive.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" one of the three men said angrily.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" echoed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Bastard! Who do you..."</p>

  <p>"Bastard! Who do you think you are? Do you know who my father is?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng repeated again and even insultingly finished the second half of the man's words.</p>
