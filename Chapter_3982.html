<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The blue-haired spirit controlled the Endless Corridor, putting the bull-headed men and the other Space Manipulating Spirits into it.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as they stepped in, the Endless Corridor collapsed with a loud bang, and they all fell off!</p>

  <p>Each step in the Endless Corridor was equal to a great distance. Thus, upon entry alone, some of the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits had already reached the second stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, and others were now falling from over ten thousand feet high to the first stair of the plateau.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits now lay scattered all over the ground, though the height wasn't enough to cause these warriors to be injured.</p>

  <p>The blue-haired spirit's face fell at this development.</p>

  <p>"What happened? Can't you keep it stable?" the bull-headed man with golden horns demanded.</p>

  <p>"It's the Bone-coagulating Powder!" the blue-haired spirit responded dismally.</p>

  <p>The Bone-coagulating Powder rendered most space theurgies useless, and the Endless Corridor, apparently, was no exception.</p>

  <p>"These people are trickier than we expected," the bull-headed man with golden horns muttered, frowning.</p>

  <p>They fell right into their opponents' trap.</p>

  <p>"It's just a minor setback. We're still more powerful! They can't escape death forever!" A blue light flashed in the blue-haired spirit's eyes. The killing intent was so strong it spread out along the space force, sending a chill down the Space Manipulating Spirits' and the bull-headed men's hearts.</p>

  <p>Each stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau had the same height, but the width differed.</p>

  <p>The width of each stair was a third shorter than that of the stair directly below it.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Heavenly Eye Vine knew how powerful the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits were.</p>

  <p>They were the two most fearsome races in the Grand Pure Realm. If they ever caught up to them, they would undoubtedly be killed.</p>

  <p>The vine made use of almost all its skills as it made its way through the Sky Ladder Plateau. It wasn't long before it passed through the second and third stairs of the plateau.</p>

  <p>As it moved up, each stair of the plateau became narrower and narrower, and the time it took to cross it became shorter and shorter.</p>

  <p>After the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits finally converged on the fourth stair, the blue-haired spirit once again activated the Endless Corridor.</p>

  <p>Learning from the last attempt, the blue-haired spirit did not extend the Endless Corridor straight to Zheng's group this time, but extended to another side, a little past them.</p>

  <p>On the Heavenly Eye Vine, Fuxi spotted the thin thread in the distance.</p>

  <p>"That space thread is chasing us again. It's already on the other side of the plateau," Fuxi warned.</p>

  <p>Sawyer squinted at the distance. The Endless Corridor was just an azure thin thread. It couldn't be seen with the naked eye from afar. He shook his head. "It's too far. It's impossible to destroy the passage from this distance."</p>

  <p>"All we can do is to make sure they don't catch up," the Snake Goddess said firmly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Heavenly Eye Vine sped up again. The three Eternal Realm Hunters were stunned into silence. Sawyer and Thurston knew that the Arrow Demons relied on this vine to move around, but they didn't expect it to be this fast.</p>

  <p>But just as they were about to reach the fifth stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, a swarm of flying creatures came into view.</p>

  <p>Dread gripped the group as they realized it was a large number of winged snakes.</p>

  <p>They were called the Earthly Dragon Snakes. Though they were barely the size of a human baby's arm, each one was lethally venomous, and they always attacked in swarms.</p>

  <p>"Do you three know any way to deal with the Earthly Dragon Snakes?"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan asked urgently.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunters had so much experience, so the other Eternal Realm warriors naturally relied on them to know better.</p>

  <p>"The Earthly Dragon Snakes are afraid of the smell of sulfur stone. Having one on hand could protect us," Pearson suggested.</p>

  <p>"But we don't have any right now," Thurston said, throwing up his hands in frustration. "Do you?"</p>

  <p>The Earthly Dragon Snakes were located in the west of the Grand Pure Realm. When they needed to break into the Earthly Dragon Snakes' territory, the Eternal Realm Hunters would dig for the sulfur stones, but they usually didn't prepare any. Besides, they had just come down from the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin and the others also shook their heads.</p>

  <p>They had never even heard of the sulfur stones, so how could they have such a thing?</p>

  <p>The faces of the three Eternal Realm Hunters darkened. Without sulfur stones, they probably wouldn't be able to escape this obstacle.</p>

  <p>As the swarm of Earthly Dragon Snakes got closer and closer, their venomous maws became more visible. The desperation loomed heavier on the group.</p>

  <p>"You can use the Black Sun to absorb them," the Snake Goddess piped up.</p>

  <p>Thurston shook his head. "No, we can't."</p>

  <p>He didn't bother to explain why they couldn't.</p>

  <p>After all, they had just joined this team. He still didn't completely trust Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng understood. He knew the space in the Black Sun wasn't that expansive. What was more, the creatures that were absorbed into the Black Sun were not instantly killed, but were just slowly exhausted until they dissipated.</p>

  <p>The real strength of the Black Sun was that it was difficult to break free from it.</p>

  <p>As long as the two brothers were separated, the Black Sun would not have an exit. No matter how powerful the creature was, it would be fatigued and die sooner or later.</p>

  <p>But just recently, the two brothers had already sucked so many members of the Sacred Horse race into it. They didn't know if the Black Sun had already wiped them out. Even if they were already dead, there was no certainty the Black Sun had enough space to hold so many Earthly Dragon Snakes.</p>

  <p>"I've heard the Earthly Dragon Snakes have very weak defensive power. We could just kill them, then," Fuxi said, stepping forward.</p>

  <p>"Kill so many Earthly Dragon Snakes one by one?" Pearson gave Fuxi a doubtful look.</p>

  <p>"Even if we can do it, it will take too much time. We can't afford it," Sawyer pointed out.</p>

  <p>Right now, all the races in the Grand Pure Realm were gathering towards them. Given the difficulty of killing the Earthly Dragon Snakes, taking them on would just give those races time to close in on them.</p>

  <p>"It won't take us long!" Fuxi said, smiling. The Sumeru Space in his hand flashed with an azure light. A large amount of brown powder poured out from it.</p>

  <p>When Pearson saw the powder, he raised his eyebrows. "What kind of powder is this?"</p>

  <p>Even though the Eternal Realm Hunters were experienced and knowledgeable, they didn't know how to use the Imprisoning Lightning, so they naturally didn't recognize this kind of item.</p>

  <p>"The Solid Lightning Powder." Fuxi chuckled.</p>

  <p>He slightly shook his palm, and an invisible force arranged the powder and turned it into the shape of a palm, as tall as a person.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Thunder Plain, Zheng had collected a massive amount of Solid Lightning Powder, just in case.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had just taken out half of it.</p>

  <p>"What does the Solid Lightning Powder do?" Sawyer asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked up at the sky. A mark of Eight Diagrams appeared in the void, which was also the central area where most of the Earthly Dragon Snakes gathered. "Have you heard of the Heavenly Thunder Plain?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Sawyer replied, nodding.</p>

  <p>"It is the thunderbolts from there!"</p>

  <p>With that, Fuxi launched a palm strike upwards.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the palm formed by the Solid Lightning Powder suddenly disappeared and reappeared on the Eight Diagrams, striking at it.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>On impact, the Eight Diagrams broke in a flash of dazzling lightning.</p>
