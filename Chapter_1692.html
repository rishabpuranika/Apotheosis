  <p>
</p>

  <p>The surname Lie was quite rare.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Lie Clan only existed within the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Since the Lie Clan that Lawson belonged to was one of the oldest clans in the Thoughtless Minds, they were more conservative and their bloodlines were valued more than that of the Ji Clan Lucille belonged to, another Ji Clan Janet belonged to and the Xuanyuan Clan Nathan belonged to.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they were more arrogant and holding more prejudices against those with a humble background.</p>

  <p>For instance, even when Supreme Lord Illusion had slaughtered his way through the Thoughtless Minds and led the entire Humanity Alliance into the third battle against them, the patriarch of the Lie Clan still considered him to be a rube.</p>

  <p>That sort of prejudice seemed to be permanently attached to the blood of the Lie Clan now.</p>

  <p>As Lawson was a Godly Genius of the Lie Clan and also one of the two Godly Geniuses from the Thoughtless Minds, his prejudice would only worsen.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng had become quite prominent in the past few years.</p>

  <p>Some took a liking to Luo Zheng's stories, while many others hated the sound of Luo Zheng's voice when it resonated in their ears. However, there was no way to block out the voice that spread through the Roaring Token. Luo Zheng's haters could do nothing but curse him inwardly instead.</p>

  <p>There were also some who were extremely irritated when they heard Luo Zheng's voice, that they became agitated and cursed the hell out of him.</p>

  <p>Lawson was one of them.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, there was a time that Lawson reached his limit and thus cursed Luo Luo Zheng and the mysterious girl with his one and only Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>This sort of powerless counterattack had happened quite a few times in the past six years.</p>

  <p>In return, the mysterious girl ruthlessly cursed Lawson for two hours.</p>

  <p>And since Lawson only had one Roaring Token which he'd already used, he wasn't able to talk back.</p>

  <p>In a fit of rage, he immediately rushed to the Lie Clan to find his father for a few more Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>Yet, his father rejected him.</p>

  <p>His father was the leader of the Lie Clan and naturally had many Roaring Tokens, but he definitely wouldn't let Lawson waste them.</p>

  <p>But who else in the entire universe had more Roaring Tokens than Luo Luo Zheng and the mysterious girl? Even if he used all of the Lie Clan's Roaring Tokens, he still would end up losing the verbal battle against the other side.</p>

  <p>Lawson had been brooding over this matter for quite a while now.</p>

  <p>Before he entered the Illusion Battlefield, he thought that he would definitely teach Luo Luo Zheng a lesson if they ever crossed paths.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the chances were too small.</p>

  <p>The chances of encountering Luo Luo Zheng in fifty supreme worlds and countless main cities were very slim. Moreover, he didn't know who Luo Luo Zheng was even if they did encounter each other. After all, he'd never seen Luo Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>Yet coincidentally, he had met Nathan. They belonged to the same supreme world.</p>

  <p>Thus, he had proudly caused Nathan's death once by using the rules of a secret land.</p>

  <p>It was also during that time that Nathan, who was originally ranked first, fell behind the hundreds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Nathan put Lawson in a main city for two days and two nights then left with thoughts about catching up to his ranking.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, the four clans were still linked as one. Had Lawson been better, he wouldn't have tried to harm Nathan. However, he was already sick in the head from the beginning. It could be said that he was one part lunatic and one part normal person.</p>

  <p>Never in Lawson's wildest dreams did he expect that Luo Luo Zheng was quite strong. The man had actually passed through both the first and second stages.</p>

  <p>However, he would still have the chance to teach the storyteller a lesson.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the beautiful hand that swung the stones around had never reached him.</p>

  <p>Not to mention encountering Luo Luo Zheng, even the chances of fighting in the early stage were extremely low for him.</p>

  <p>Lawson had finally appeared on the scene and was now faced against a powerhouse. The one he was up against now was coincidentally, Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, storytellers weren't regarded highly in the world of martial arts. There was even a trace of disdain in Lawson's words.</p>

  <p>Even then, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the least bit annoyed. "I'm sorry for my poor stories," he simply replied.</p>

  <p>When Lawson saw how calm Luo Luo Zheng was, the sneer on his face grew. "I see that you are usually so good at telling stories, why don't you tell a few more here? How about you tell a story before we fight?"</p>

  <p>His words were obviously sarcastic. It was clear that he was truly annoyed by this matter.</p>

  <p>"Sounds good," Lucille, who was on top of the stone, answered for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was rather willing to listen to Luo Zheng's story. Luo Luo Zheng himself just stayed silent.</p>

  <p>Lawson turned around and glared fiercely at Lucille when he heard her words. Just then, a voice from the clouds was heard. The mysterious girl who had been presiding over the Illusion Battlefield since the beginning now sounded different from her usually cold tone. She echoed Lucille's sentiments and said, "I also agree."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nathan laughed so hard that he had to clutch his stomach.</p>

  <p>"What exact stories did Luo Luo Zheng tell?" Mu Ning asked Tianming curiously. It was because in the Purple Power World, Mu Ning never had the chance to hear any of Luo Zheng's stories told through the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Tianming slightly smiled and said, "A lot. The legends and fables you heard in the Central Region, as well as some historical stories."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Lawson began to feel heavy.</p>

  <p>It was then that he decided to make his move.</p>

  <p>The grey light Luo Luo Zheng had displayed earlier indeed made him feel a bit afraid, but he was still highly confident that he could capture Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You've gone far enough, and it's finally the end," Lawson said as he stepped forward. A huge pit appeared the moment his toes touched the board.</p>

  <p>His body instantly rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>However, he intended to use his bare hands against his foe instead of using his weapon.</p>

  <p>"Are you planning on going head-to-head with me?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He was a little surprised, but he had on a faint smile. He took his stance as Lawson enlarged his pupils, but he had no weapons in his hands at all.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's gonna fight against Lawson with his bare hands?! He is too arrogant!" Nathan said and shook his head. However, he was looking forward to Lawson being humiliated.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say..." Lucille murmured. She had fought against Luo Luo Zheng before, so she had a deep impression of Luo Zheng's tyrannical body.</p>

  <p>The Lie Clan was the only one of the four great clans that was good at body refining.</p>

  <p>Some of their ancestors had taken the path of body refinement, opened up Nine Divine Stars, and became True Gods.</p>

  <p>From the ancient times until the present, only a select few had reached the Divine Dao. It was likely that only one person from the Lie Clan had managed to become a True God through body refining.</p>

  <p>It was the reason Lawson had no need for his weapon. His own hands were one of his most powerful weapons.</p>

  <p>However, what he didn't know was that Luo Luo Zheng had gone a step further than him. His entire body was a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>"Since you refuse to use your spear, then go to hell! Ha-ha!" Lawson was halfway through the sprint, and burst into a maniacal laugh at what he saw as Luo Zheng's arrogance. His fists suddenly intertwined as he leapt high into the air, and then flew straight towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The forceful energy within Lawson's body suddenly exploded in mid-air as a blood-red halo enveloped his whole being. His speed increased yet again at the explosion!</p>

  <p>Although he was only six feet tall, he emitted such a powerful Mu Ning that it felt like he had thrown a mountain at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's coming," Luo Luo Zheng whispered as his eyes narrowed into slits. His right foot stepped back, and his strength began to flow into his right fist.</p>

  <p>He knew that since Lawson dared to attack him with a pair of bare fists, he must be extraordinarily powerful.</p>

  <p>He then extracted the power of the dragon scales and at the same time, a little starlight appeared on his fist.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng didn't think highly or lowly of any of his opponents.</p>

  <p>Although this Lawson was crazily arrogant, his strength was definitely worthy of Luo Zheng's vigilance. Thus, he quickly activated the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>"I'll kill you in one punch!" Lawson declared.</p>

  <p>Lawson's voice was painfully sharp now. The closer he got to Luo Luo Zheng, the faster his speed became, and the blood-red halo around his body became denser and denser.</p>

  <p>When he had been three hundred feet away, the blood-red halo appeared dim. Now that he was only one hundred feet away, Lawson turned into a completely bloody being as he charged towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that this punch will directly smash that arrogant kid into meat paste?"</p>

  <p>"Definitely..."</p>

  <p>Outside the painting, everyone in the Lie Clan had mocking grins plastered on their faces.</p>

  <p>Was Luo Luo Zheng really going head to head with the warrior of their clan? Even the ogres that were famous for their body refinement would have to think twice before they did such a thing. Before this fight, Luo Luo Zheng had relied on the Saint Killing Spear to display quite a good level of strength.</p>

  <p>But to go head to head with their clan's Lawson? Wasn't that too childish?</p>
