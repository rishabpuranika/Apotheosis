<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Nathan? How did he know? Do you know where he is now?" Confused, the master of the Cao Clan asked.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Bruno replied, "I don't know. He said he would leave, and if we were meant to meet again, our paths would surely cross."</p>

  <p>Right before Nathan left, he said something vaguely strange to Bruno using his life vitality as he tried his best in persuading him to leave the divine city.</p>

  <p>When Nathan was trying to convince him, his voice was affirmative. Given what had happened in the Bright Night City, it seemed that he had already known in advance what would happen, but Bruno didn't know how he knew about it.</p>

  <p>With this as proof, Bruno was convinced that Nathan was no ordinary person, for there was something quite odd about him.</p>

  <p>While the people in the Bright Night City were surprised, Mike had taken Zheng into another region very far off from where they were, more than ten million miles away.</p>

  <p>There was a Godly Way Tablet in the region which was next to a large central divine city that hosted around over a million divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Looking at the central divine city, Zheng said, "Father, should we spread the news of the massacre?"</p>

  <p>If the people in the divine cities were to be slaughtered at this rate, then the divine land would suffer great losses for sure.</p>

  <p>Now, if Zheng and his father were to spread the news, then at least in that way they could save many lives.</p>

  <p>But Mike shook his head and said, "It's too risky. We don't even know where the Yellow Emperor Guards will appear. Even if we spread the news, it can't spread throughout the entire divine land in a short span of time and they can go somewhere else."</p>

  <p>If the Yellow Emperor Guards discovered that the city was empty, then they would probably head to the north or south of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"If you want to save the people of the divine land, then you have to kill the Yellow Emperor Guards," Mike said as he gently gave Zheng's head a little pat. "Go."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the go signal, Zheng nodded his head. Immediately, he drew an arc in the air and charged straight towards the Godly Way Tablet below.</p>

  <p>The three thousand Godly Way Tablets were distributed evenly in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was such a wide and vast area that there was a small chance of meeting any of the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>However, one thing that needed to be noted was the fact that there were several Godly Way Tablets located around the Time Sea. When Mike brought Zheng there, he was already well prepared that if anything happened, he and Zheng would immediately leave.</p>

  <p>In the past month, the Godly Way Tablets in Zheng's mind were continuously lit up one after another.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Godly Ways also filled the marks on the Infinity Ruler. In Zheng's inner world, the Godly Plate spread out a constant dazzling and magnificent luster.</p>

  <p>While Zheng absorbed the Godly Ways throughout the divine land, it seemed that there was someone even busier than him? the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's inner world had become a complicated world where many sects with different strength existed. Every once in a while, new talents would appear and after comprehending a Godly Way, they would create an empire with the hopes of unifying the whole world.</p>

  <p>However, they did not succeed all because of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's inner world, the Evil God was considered to be a legend.</p>

  <p>Although he rarely showed himself in public, the elders of the large sects and influential forces would warn their younger generation not to provoke him in any manner.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Evil God had been very cranky.</p>

  <p>For several times, Zheng had promised him that he would leave his inner world, but after years of waiting, he was not able to hear any news from the matter.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the Evil God could feel the fluctuations and inconsistencies of the inner world's power, most especially when the Godly Plate and the nine stars shone brightly. Whenever that happened, he could obviously feel that someone had taken away the power, thinking that the person behind it must be Zheng.</p>

  <p>But now that Zheng didn't show up, the Evil God was not able to do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Thirty years ago, the Evil God wasn't able to stand it any longer. There was one time that he halved a continent in the inner world to vent his anger and lure him to appear, but even so, Zheng remained concealed.</p>

  <p>However, during this period of time, the Evil God was in a much lighter and joyous mood.</p>

  <p>Having such great talent, he was able to cultivate one more Godly Way every time there was a new Godly Way added to the Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>A while ago, he had completely understood and comprehended about four hundred Godly Ways in the Godly Plate. But according to the world's rules, he was still unable to reach the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>But just recently, the Evil God felt such unexpected joy when he found out that the number of the Godly Ways in the Godly Plate had increased at an exponential speed.</p>

  <p>At that time, he honestly did not know what it meant to absorb so many Godly Ways, nor did he understand how talented he was.</p>

  <p>Not having anyone to compare himself with, he viewed that people outside this world were most probably like Zheng who could master so many Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the north, Zheng had landed in front of another Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>In his mind, there were already 2, 999 marks of Godly Ways lit up, with only one remaining Godly Way that was right in front of him.</p>

  <p>'After absorbing 3, 000 Godly Ways, I will become a consummate True God who can take in everything in the world. However, I don't exactly know what will happen to me after I absorb this Godly Way to fill the Infinity Ruler, ' Zheng thought to himself in an excited manner.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, two golden rings of light twinkled in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The strong internal momentum emitted from the Godly Way Tablet shot along the rings of light and rushed toward the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>On a small mark, there was a unique symbol indicating that the Godly Way was being absorbed.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The golden light in the mark instantaneously flew from one end of the Infinity Ruler to the other end.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the entire jade ruler seemed to come to life and circled in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>At that point, Mike knew that this was the last piece of the three thousand Godly Ways. Concerned, he could not help but descend and ask, "What do you feel? Are there any changes?"</p>

  <p>Dazed, Zheng stood still. Frowning, he said, "It seems that there is no change.</p>

  <p>The ruler just keeps spinning."</p>

  <p>"It keeps spinning?" Mike asked as his eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"It casually stops and points to the south!" Zheng said as he moved his body to the southern direction. .</p>

  <p>But no matter how Zheng rotated his body, the ruler acted like a compass as it kept on pointing towards the south.</p>

  <p>"The Time Sea?" Mike asked with astonishment.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng was in the north by east and was pointing at the direction where the Time Sea was located.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a faint vibration in the area.</p>

  <p>It was not violent, but everyone in the divine land had noticed and felt it clearly.</p>

  <p>Shaking slightly, the Floating Islands were not exempted from the vibration which did not come from underground. In fact, it seemed that the whole divine land was actually trembling.</p>

  <p>"Wait, what's going on? Did another Holy Being die?" Zheng looked up at the sky as he spoke.</p>

  <p>In his mind, he thought that this vibration could only be caused by the collapse of the universe.</p>

  <p>Surprised, Mike spoke, "No, no universe collapses in this way. In fact, the Mountain of Holy Beings is emerging as we speak!"</p>

  <p>"The Mountain of Holy Beings is emerging? Didn't you say it would be some time before that happens?" Curious, Zheng clarified.</p>

  <p>"Well, it confuses me too." Mike looked at Zheng in confusion. "Maybe it's because of the Infinity Ruler."</p>
