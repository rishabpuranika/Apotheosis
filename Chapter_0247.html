<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 247 The Immortal Soul (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>While Saul watched Luo Zheng beat all the evil ghosts, he remained silent for a while. Then slowly, he said, "Interesting! There appears to be a dragon lying dormant in your body."</p>

  <p>A dragon? Luo Zheng did not try to deny it. In fact, there was not only one dragon inside his body --- but nine!</p>

  <p>However, only the cyan dragon that lay at the bottom of his body woke up. Particularly, it was the dragon that killed the evil spirits. It was a shame that he could not tell when the other eight dragons were going to awaken. Perhaps, the next dragon might only wake up after the current cyan dragon's scales were completely lit up.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Not bad at all! Indeed, you are qualified to proceed to the fifth round. Seeing that you have already passed four tests by now, I won't force you to give up anymore. Should you be successful in the final test, you will obtain the Sun Moon Stars Picture, which is the most powerful Contemplation Picture in the fairy palace. Your only chance at winning, however, depends on you going at it with all your strength. Since the attacks of the ghosts affected your soul, I can assist you with your recovery."</p>

  <p>As a creature of wide knowledge and experiences, Saul had seen all kinds of people while staying at the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>During his encounter with Luo Zheng, he had looked down on the man repeatedly. Nevertheless, Luo Zheng succeeded in conquering all the difficulties and consistently passed the tests one at a time. After a while, Saul could no longer intimidate the man and allowed him to advance to the next test instead.</p>

  <p>As soon as Saul stated his intention to help, a halo of light descended from the sky and directly entered Zheng's brain.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his soul appeared to be in a relaxed state, giving him a sense of pleasure and making him almost want to cry out in bliss. Despite Saul being just a puppet, he had casually displayed his surprising skills to cure people.</p>

  <p>After the halo disappeared, Luo Zheng, who had been beyond exhausted, suddenly felt energized as his eyes beamed with high spirits.</p>

  <p>After stretching his limbs in satisfaction, he turned to Saul eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I don't think I need to take a break anymore. Allow me to start the final challenge now," Luo Zheng said, looking at the endless marsh before him.</p>

  <p>While bracing himself for another fight, he could not help but wonder,</p>

  <p>'What kind of opponent am I going to be up against in the last test?'</p>

  <p>It was not long before an armored warrior appeared from the marsh.</p>

  <p>Squinting for a better look, Luo Zheng took in the appearance of his enemy.</p>

  <p>The armored warrior looked as tall as he did, but the Mu Ning emanating from him was confusing.</p>

  <p>"This armored man is only half-step into the nature level? It's incredible!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was dumbfounded. It never occurred to him that he would meet an opponent who was at the half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, even if he had to confront nature creatures, they could hardly stay alive in the battle, let alone opponents with only half-step into the nature level. So far, only the Illuminating Soul Realm masters could beat him.</p>

  <p>It was going to be a piece of cake for him to deal with anyone of the half-step into the nature level. Because of this, Luo Zheng was perplexed about the arrangement.</p>

  <p>"Do not look down on your opponent. The fifth and also the final test is the most difficult that you will have to face. The real strength of that armored man is about the same as yours, half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>If you are a nature creature, then so is the armored man," Saul explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled lightly and said, "Then, I will definitely win."</p>

  <p>"Huh?!" Saul exclaimed, looking at him in mild surprise. "How could that be so easy? Within the warrior's body, there is a strand of soul remnant from an unknown immortal. Although the soul remnant has no memory, it comes from the soul of an immortal. Thus, it has inherited the battle skills and styles of the immortal. Even though he is of the same level as you, you are not a match for him in terms of the cultivation method and actual combat experience."</p>

  <p>"A strand of soul remnant from an immortal?" Luo Zheng repeated slowly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Saul's words, his heart grew heavy and his facial expression turned glum.</p>

  <p>The same strength, used by different people, would show different effects.</p>

  <p>A great example was Luo Zheng himself. Even though he had only entered half-step into the nature level, it was rather easy for him to defeat nature creatures.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, his opponent now was an immortal!</p>

  <p>Except that, this immortal before him reduced his level to half-step into the nature level just to fight with him.</p>

  <p>'I must be careful, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself. He became more vigilant than ever. Holding the broken flying knife, he gazed unwaveringly at the armored warrior not far away.</p>

  <p>The armored warrior approached Luo Zheng at a slow pace, appearing as though he were only taking a leisure walk.</p>

  <p>And as he continued to tread steadily, waves of life energy emitted from his helmet and armor.</p>

  <p>"It is life energy!"</p>

  <p>As the armored warrior was presently half-step into the nature level, he could not use life vitality. Therefore, Luo Zheng assumed that the matter he saw coming from the armored warrior was merely life energy.</p>

  <p>However, the life energy seemed so strange. Instead of being a single color, there were several of them! Even more, the life energy constantly changed shades.</p>

  <p>'What kind of cultivation method has he mastered that enables him to summon such vibrant life energy? No matter what, I'd better strike him first to gain the upper hand, ' Luo Zheng thought. Like a flying shuttle, Luo Zheng pushed off the ground and rushed towards the armored warrior. At the same time, he shot the broken flying knife straight at the armored warrior.</p>

  <p>With a loud rustle, the broken flying knife rotated and came sharply at the head of the armored warrior.</p>

  <p>Trying to outmaneuver the armored warrior, Luo Zheng thought of a strategy to subdue him.</p>

  <p>For his plan to work, the armored warrior had to dodge the flying knife, and then that was when he planned to use the Spiritual Thorn. After that, he would retrieve the flying knife and initiate his fatal attack.</p>

  <p>However, the armored warrior ruined his plan with a single move, one that was simple yet effective enough for him to avoid biting the dust so early in the battle.</p>

  <p>In a very subtle manner, the armored warrior... tilted his head.</p>
