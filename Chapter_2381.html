</p>

  <p>Nicholas' grab was so powerful and intense that it left deep marks on Joy's body.</p>

  <p>Although she was badly injured, Joy managed to drag Zheng out of the Time Sea and brought him to the seaside.</p>

  <p>The petal that was lodged between Zheng's eyebrows continued to shine brightly. It emitted a diamond-like pattern that engulfed them both.</p>

  <p>"Come on! Let's leave!"</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>With that, they left as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>If they moved only once, the Holy Beings could sense their movements through the fluctuations in the space and even locate their general direction and position.</p>

  <p>However, because of the silence in the entire divine land, it was a remote possibility.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas had hidden a lot of skills from everyone. Joy was extremely careful once she seized the chance to escape.</p>

  <p>During the silent period, she had used the Grand Teleportation four times consecutively.</p>

  <p>Estelle could not make the entire divine land silent for a long time.</p>

  <p>Five seconds was all the time she could offer!</p>

  <p>The Floating Islands above the Time Sea began to descend during the silent period.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan's Floating Island almost reached the surface of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>However, once the silent period was over, the divine texture arrays hidden among the Floating Islands began to function at a normal pace.</p>

  <p>Once all the islands started to ascend, all the True Gods on the Floating Islands released their pent-up breath.</p>

  <p>Even if one island fell into the Time Sea, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p>

  <p>After the silent period passed, the boundless space in the entire divine land turned back to normal.</p>

  <p>Although it was a short period, it still caused tremendous chaos.</p>

  <p>Across the island, Nicholas stood still.</p>

  <p>The energy that had been extracted from the Nine Divine Stars was constantly rolling within his body. Even though it was not released, it had already caused the space around him to bend. Anyone who saw him would get the illusion of a twisted body.</p>

  <p>The island itself was enveloped in a deep depression.</p>

  <p>Samuel squinted his eyes and finally looked relaxed.</p>

  <p>Clark, Jeremiah and other Holy Beings, however, got up from the ground looking glum, for Zheng not only ran away, but also took the jade seal and imprisoned a group of consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had never imagined that the end would be so drastic.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nelly had a strange gleam in her eyes and seemed excited by the turn of events.</p>

  <p>She had witnessed the petal shining brightly between Zheng's brows, and when she saw Joy disappear with Zheng in an instant, she couldn't restrain her excitement.</p>

  <p>'In the end, he escaped.</p>

  <p>But will we ever meet again?'</p>

  <p>Thinking about it brought a touch of sadness to her heart. 'Will we be friends or enemies when we meet again?'</p>

  <p>"Definitely not enemies!"</p>

  <p>Nelly muttered defiantly, as her eyes became sharp as a sword. The characteristics that she inherited from Rachelle were not really that bad.</p>

  <p>Once she had a goal in mind, she would go for it, no matter how hard the obstacles proved to be.</p>

  <p>Liusu secretly let out a sigh of relief, while holding on to Aleyna's hand tightly. Kelsey and Aleyna also seemed relaxed.</p>

  <p>All the members of the Han Clan looked at Samuel with bitter disappointment.</p>

  <p>Joy was the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan, the second most important and revered person in the family.</p>

  <p>At such a crucial moment, not only did their Holy Emperor refrain from stopping the fight, but he also stayed out of it. Samuel's image was completely shattered in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Even Pascal, who normally never cared much, was also affected by his father's deeds. This was not the father he knew from childhood.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch of the Sun Blind race continued to remain still.</p>

  <p>Because her face was covered with a mask, one could not guess if she was happy or sad.</p>

  <p>As for the other Holy Beings, especially those of the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan, there was a smirk on their faces.</p>

  <p>To them, it was better that the jade seal was in possession of Zheng, than Nicholas.</p>

  <p>In fact, Woodruff from the War God Hall didn't even try to cover his smile. He was not really keen on a tit for tat with Nicholas, otherwise he would have praised Zheng and Estelle for being smart.</p>

  <p>Nicholas lightly took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Even that made a thud.</p>

  <p>The strong energy that was accumulating in his body released a little. In a flash, the ground below cracked.</p>

  <p>"Estelle... Humph!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas grumbled as he disappeared.</p>

  <p>As per the tradition, the Sun Blind race held a bonfire dinner after the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>All the resources that would be used for the dinner party were from the Time Sea. Hence, they were very precious.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas was not in the mood to join in the dinner party.</p>

  <p>After he left, a group of Holy Beings from the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands, like Clark and Jeremiah, also chose to leave.</p>

  <p>Only the True Gods as well as the Holy Beings that were not the alliance stayed for dinner.</p>

  <p>It was not until the last Holy Being had left that Woodruff chuckled and said, "Well, Estelle is definitely a smart woman! She had already gone against Murphy long back in Mike's universe. And this time she went against Nicholas."</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings also revealed faint smiles.</p>

  <p>These powerful clans did not want to offend the alliance, but they certainly did not like Nicholas. Hence, the Holy Beings were happy to see him in trouble.</p>

  <p>Joy and Zheng continued to use the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>The two of them travelled through space and many regions in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, she and Zheng would appear in a divine city, causing a cry of surprise among the witnesses. The two would then quickly disappear, leaving behind a group of completely flabbergasted True Gods.</p>

  <p>Then at times, they would appear on top of a high mountain.</p>

  <p>They stayed only for an instant, before Zheng was immediately dragged away by Joy.</p>

  <p>In such a way, they teleported around 30 to 40 times in a row.</p>

  <p>Finally they reached a lake.</p>

  <p>This time, as soon as she showed up with Zheng, she couldn't help letting out a piercing scream. Her fine eyebrows were completely distorted as she grimaced in pain.</p>

  <p>She had been grabbed by Nicholas and in the process was hurt very badly.</p>

  <p>But during their teleportation journey, she was too busy to think of anything else. All she had in mind was to get Zheng to safety. Now the pain was increasing for her to ignore.</p>

  <p>Zheng gazed at her waist and frowned. Those were deep wounds.</p>

  <p>Across her waist, the three traces of blood had turned black, continuously hissing with smoke.</p>

  <p>As time went on, the black fog did not dissipate, but became more intense.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas had grabbed her, Zheng used the power of the jade seal to save her, but he still couldn't eliminate Nicholas's attack. It seemed that Nicholas had used some way to avoid this.</p>

  <p>"The wounds..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng started to speak, Joy shook her head, while she endured the pain. Later she stood up and walked towards the lake.</p>

  <p>When she noticed that Zheng had also followed her, she quickly stopped him and said, "Wait there! Don't come over here!"</p>

  <p>When the clear water spread over her waist and touched the wounds, there was a hissing sound.</p>

  <p>The clear water soon turned black, as her wounds continued to heal.</p>

  <p>Soon the lake transformed into a black and sinister-looking lake.</p>

  <p>All the fish and other living beings residing within the lake died instantly. Even the beings within a100-foot radius were not spared.</p>

  <p>"Such a powerful poison!" Zheng's eyes flashed as he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>After soaking herself for a little more time, she came out ashore. She glanced at Zheng with a pale face and said, "I'll heal myself first."</p>

  <p>Zheng had planned to take her to the fairy palace. He remembered that there were many pills in his master's pill refining room which would help in healing her wounds.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as she sat on the ground, she took out a colorful pill. It looked like a pill that was refined at least seven times.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Zheng didn't say anything but quietly stood aside. Then he turned his palm and looked at the little black snake. He frowned. Now that he had safely escaped from the Time Sea, how should he deal with these consummate True Gods?</p>
