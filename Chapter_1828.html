<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The members of the Collapsing Mountain race carried Zheng and Liusu as they moved forward, and they eventually reached a large encampment. As these two individuals chatted along the way, Zheng and Liusu gained a basic understanding of each other.</p>

  <p>The buildings of the encampment looked very primitive and seemed that they were made of the same kind of silver stones. The buildings' surfaces were embellished with different patterns, and although they looked rough, they seemed to be heavy and sturdy.</p>

  <p>After the Collapsing Mountain members entered the encampment, they threw Zheng and Liusu down into a corner and left.</p>

  <p>The height of the Collapsing Mountain member's shoulders was less than ten feet, but when he slammed Zheng and Liusu down on the ground, the two of them let out muffled groans.</p>

  <p>Due to the effect of the strong gravitational force, the power behind the impact shouldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Zheng still felt alright. It was as if his internal organs were in turmoil, but he quickly returned to normal.</p>

  <p>Liusu, on the other hand, did not do too well. Her cultivation level was higher than Zheng's, but she was still a woman and didn't pay particular attention to body refinement. The Collapsing Mountain member did not show her the slightest bit of mercy. After being thrown violently on the ground, she suffered an internal injury and a bit of blood dripped out of the corner of her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Are you alright?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Hmm..." Liusu was devastated. This kind of injury was nothing to her, but this kind of treatment was a bit of a blow to her.</p>

  <p>After being thrown onto the ground, the two of them were immobilized and could not get up from the ground. The strong gravitational force was almost everywhere. It felt like there were dozens of mountains on top of them. How difficult was it for them to get up?</p>

  <p>Zheng could only activate the power of the dragon scales. The force of gravity here was much stronger than that on the huge silver boulder.</p>

  <p>Even though he already borrowed the power of the dragon scales, he still wasn't able to stand up. Finally, he rolled and sat up.</p>

  <p>He couldn't see anything while he had been lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>After he managed to sit up, he leaned on the wall beside him. Only then did he notice that there were a lot of other martial artists in that place, aside from him and Liusu.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>The martial artists had strange appearances— some had green skin, some looked like dwarves, and some were also very handsome. However, all of the martial artists here were humanoid in form.</p>

  <p>Why were most intelligent beings shaped similar to humans?</p>

  <p>Zheng had thought about this long ago. Whether it was the Sacred race, human race, Demon Night race, or even ogres, the various races all developed their own culture and influence. Their common characteristic was that they were all bipedal. Their body shapes and appearances were different from each other, but the internal structures of their bodies were similar. The Demon Night members only had long and sharp ears, while the ogres looked fiercer.</p>

  <p>Strange creatures, like the warriors of the sorcerer race, also had appearances that were not too different from human forms.</p>

  <p>Even the final forms of many legendary beasts seemed to be based according to human standards. Even in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race were also like this.</p>

  <p>This couldn't have been a coincidence.</p>

  <p>These martial artists were similar to Liusu: they were all at the top-level of the Spirit Transformation Realm. However, the martial artists were all lying motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>When they saw that Zheng was able to sit up, their facial expressions were very strange. They had noticed sometime earlier that Zheng was only at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors who were sent to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land cultivated in the cities nearby the teleporting area. A place like this was not somewhere that a warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm could go to.</p>

  <p>Zheng was different. The teleporting area where he was sent to had already been abandoned for countless years, and he was the only one sent there.</p>

  <p>Then he met Liusu. The two of them hid within the territory of the Collapsing Mountain race while they were being chased by the Formless Sky Python.</p>

  <p>It was not that surprising that a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior came to the territory of the Collapsing Mountain race. The problem was that this guy could sit up!</p>

  <p>"My friend, you are not bad. You were able to sit up right after you arrived. You have innate divine strength!" a warrior, who did not look human, said to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng leaned against the wall and smiled when he heard this. "I was just lucky."</p>

  <p>"Lucky? Are you kidding me? I've been lying here for three years, but I've never heard of anyone who was lucky enough to sit up!" the warrior told Zheng incredulously.</p>

  <p>'He has been lying here for three years!'</p>

  <p>Upon hearing these words, Zheng was also somewhat speechless.</p>

  <p>With such a strong gravitational force pulling them to the ground, even lying down here was a form of cultivation.</p>

  <p>If one gained the ability to stand up in the future, then they would be able to accept the Collapsing Mountain race's trial. If one obtained the strength source, then that would be a great leap for them.</p>

  <p>"You have only been lying here for three years. I have already been here for nine years! If I still can't stand up in the next year, I'm afraid that I would be driven out!" another warrior complained with a sullen face.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it good to leave?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Lying here for ten years was unbearable. Without the help of the Collapsing Mountain warriors, it would have been almost impossible for them to climb out. Zheng didn't know what this martial artist was sad about.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! My trial tally will be wasted then. For the sake of this trial tally, I nearly lost my life!" the warrior said dejectedly.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't realize that.</p>

  <p>Before they had come here, Liusu told him that she had a lot of trial tallies. Zheng naturally felt inclined to believe that it was easy to obtain a trial tally.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how many martial artists had sacrificed their lives in this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land just to obtain a trial tally.</p>

  <p>Some martial artists painstakingly obtained a trial tally and had to travel thousands of miles to enter the six great cultivation places. The Collapsing Mountain race was the cultivation place of body refiners, and many martial artists didn't hesitate to bring their trial tallies here.</p>

  <p>However, they all ended up being thrown onto the ground by the Collapsing Mountain warriors, left to lie motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>This immobility often lasted for a few years.</p>

  <p>Some martial artists with innate divine strength were able to stand up on their own after a few months and gradually adapted to the gravitational force. They could then join the Collapsing Mountain race and underwent trials, until they completed them. Their strength and physical body would increase at an alarming rate.</p>

  <p>However, the majority of martial artists had to lie down here for seven to eight years before they could gradually stand up.</p>

  <p>For the Spirit Transformation Realm warriors, this length of time wasn't a problem. But if they didn't stand up within ten years, they would be expelled from the Collapsing Mountain race. It was hard for them to accept this.</p>

  <p>That was the reason why Liusu wasn't enthusiastic about going to the Collapsing Mountain race's place. She preferred to enter the Soul Suppressing Cliff, and there was no need for her to refine her body. If she was to be brought to the Collapsing Mountain race's territory, she needed to rely on herself to stand up and walk within ten years if she wanted to exit. Otherwise, it was just a waste of her time.</p>

  <p>Her time was actually more valuable than that of ordinary martial artists.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, the spots of light at the top of the cave gradually regained their brightness one by one, emitting a faint light. Under the beams of numerous spotlights, night in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land ended and the day finally came.</p>

  <p>The warriors around Zheng were still lying motionless on the ground like corpses.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but feel sorry for them as he thought about how hard it would be to remain in this position for ten years without being able to move a single muscle.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a roar came from the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>One of the Collapsing Mountain members stood at the peak and began roaring towards the sky with all his might.</p>

  <p>At the same time, all of the other Collapsing Mountain members answered that person's roar, and they began to shout and sing.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't understand the song at all. They sang in the language of the Collapsing Mountain race and didn't really follow the rules of music. But beneath their rough and orderly voices, he sensed an extraordinary strength and a unique rhythm.</p>

  <p>"What did they sing?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Liusu curled her lips. "Listen carefully. It's good for you. If you can stand up, you can carry me on your back and leave this place."</p>

  <p>She had no plan to refine her body and definitely didn't want to lie here for ten years. After only a few hours of lying on the ground, she was already quite crestfallen. If she really lay here without moving, ten years of her life would definitely have been wasted.</p>

  <p>Liusu thought it over for a few hours and realized that Zheng was her only hope.</p>

  <p>This guy had just entered this territory and was already able to use his own strength to sit up. She naturally hoped that he could quickly adapt to the gravity here.</p>

  <p>"The song is good for me? How?" Zheng had a look of confusion on his face for a short while, but soon felt something strange happen within his body.</p>

  <p>These sounds contained an unusual vibration, and the continuous roaring had resonated with Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>With this resonance, the blood flow throughout Zheng's body suddenly surged, and his heart rate also began to increase. As he looked at the other martial artists, all of them were flushed red.</p>

  <p>This Collapsing Mountain race was extremely unique. They were able to refine their bodies just by singing a song?</p>
