  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine's only weakness was the heavenly eye.</p>

  <p>As a plant, any part cut off from its body could still grow and regenerate independently.</p>

  <p>Back when the Arrow Demons fought with the Lightning Ghosts, the latter utilized their ability to travel through space from thousands of miles away to catch their enemies off guard.</p>

  <p>In a flash, they were able to cut the Heavenly Eye Vine into dozens of pieces.</p>

  <p>Over time, these Heavenly Eye Vine cuttings took root independently and grew all over the place which became even more enemies of the Lightning Ghosts.</p>

  <p>However, this golden axe that appeared out of the blue was no ordinary weapon.</p>

  <p>When this golden axe was wielded, it cut through the vine and left behind a small circle of golden light. Upon closer inspection, this circle of light was actually golden flames that quickly spread along the length of the vine.</p>

  <p>If nothing was done to stop them, the golden flames would quickly swallow up the whole plant and reduce it into nothing but ash.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A sharp golden ray of sword radiance slashed through the vine as Eastern Emperor Taiyi brandished his blade and cut off the part that already caught fire.</p>

  <p>From a once mighty vine, the sliced part fell to the ground and burned bright until there was nothing but ash and smoke.</p>

  <p>Ying sported an extremely serious look on her face. "Who in the world summoned the golden axe to attack us?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi scouted through the heavenly eye and also spread out his spiritual sense in an effort to find the target. "I don't know. The power of space is so weird."</p>

  <p>After the huge axe appeared, it quickly shot up into the air and disappeared right before their very eyes. Not even Fuxi's efforts were enough to find its location.</p>

  <p>"I recognized that golden axe. It's the bull-headed monsters' weapon,"</p>

  <p>Thurston told them.</p>

  <p>Bull-headed monsters were one of the most dangerous races in the Grand Pure Realm as they had excellent combat ability. Fortunately, their weakness lay in their lackluster agility so one would generally be safe if they kept their distance.</p>

  <p>"Those creatures aren't idiots. If you're their common target then they would team-up and stop at nothing to subdue you. That's an incredibly serious matter that we need to consider," Pearson grumbled.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that difficult to fight against a single race. Each had their own strengths but also their own weaknesses.</p>

  <p>If one knew what these weaknesses were and how to exploit them, then it would be an easy fight.</p>

  <p>Known as the strongest melee fighters, the bull-headed monsters were a considerably powerful force and those targeted by them would undoubtedly face a miserable end.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Eternal Realm Hunters dealt with them easily through the advantage of agility.</p>

  <p>However, the situation now was different. They were not just dealing with the bull-headed monsters but all the other races. With everyone's strengths and weaknesses balanced, the opposition became a formidable force to be reckoned. Even the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization would flinch at the face of such an outstanding coalition, what more Luo Zheng's puny group?</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A space fluctuation appeared above them, accompanied by a flash of golden light. For a split second, everything was silent until a huge, golden axe suddenly emerged and hacked down towards them!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Heavenly Eye Vine was prepared and twisted its body to the side to avoid the attack. The golden axe hit the ground instead of the vine and left behind a shining, golden crack.</p>

  <p>Flames blazed within the crack but seemed to be unable to burn the ground.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, the golden fire was automatically extinguished.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter where they are. We should climb up to the top of the Sky Ladder Plateau first," Luo Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's command, the Heavenly Eye Vine twisted its body and quickly fled the place.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no way their escape was going to be so easy. As the Heavenly Eye Vine fled, another space fluctuation appeared above them as two golden axes dropped down at the same time.</p>

  <p>The axes boxed in the Heavenly Eye Vine from both sides and left no space for it to dodge.</p>

  <p>"To the left!" Luo Zheng roared.</p>

  <p>Quick reflexes were what they needed at that moment.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine followed Luo Zheng's command and twisted its body to the left.</p>

  <p>With the golden axe on the left about to slash down on their heads, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan all scattered but, to their horror, Luo Zheng remained to charge at it head-on!</p>

  <p>Thurston's eyes widened in shock when he witnessed what Luo Zheng was about to do. "Is he crazy?! What in the world is he doing?!"</p>

  <p>Sawyer shared his sentiments and shouted after Luo Zheng desperately. "Get out of the way! What the hell are you doing?!"</p>

  <p>These axes were no ordinary weapons and the flames they emitted were called Life Devouring Flames that could burn any living creatures to ashes in mere seconds!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a wide stance and raised his hands in an effort to resist the oncoming golden axe!</p>

  <p>Sharp as it was, it wasn't enough to cut through Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"What a strong body!"</p>

  <p>"After all, his physical body is even stronger than Hawley's!"</p>

  <p>"But the Life Devouring Flames! No matter how strong his body is, the flames will still devour him..."</p>

  <p>There was nothing the Eternal Realm Hunters could really do but stare nervously at Luo Zheng and wait for his fate to consume him.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, the small golden flames quickly spread from the sharp edge of the axe and onto Luo Zheng's arm as it burned his flesh with a sizzling sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's virtually indestructible body quickly crumpled and charred under the onslaught of the flames but still, he remained standing.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to burn me to nothing but ashes?" he muttered. The flames continued to lick at his skin but Luo Zheng continued to carry the axe with both hands.</p>

  <p>Once caught in the flames, the fire would only continue to spread along the victim's body faster and faster.</p>

  <p>If this went on, Luo Zheng would definitely be burned to nothing, including the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body.</p>

  <p>Up until now, the only way Luo Zheng was able to use this formidable ancestry-level bloodline he obtained was by putting himself in danger. If he helped his friends but did not put his own safety in question, then the bloodline would never activate.</p>

  <p>In a real predicament like this one, he was sure that the ancestry-level bloodline would rise up and protect itself!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Sure enough, Luo Zheng's shoulder suddenly swelled and formed a big sac that exploded and turned into a monstrous, gaping mouth with sharp teeth!</p>

  <p>"Okay, here it goes," Luo Zheng murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>He could only sigh at the sight of the ugly mouth on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was truly powerful and Luo Zheng had yet to see any limits or weaknesses to it.</p>

  <p>However, every time it showed off its power, it seemed to always attach a gruesome and somewhat terrifying addition to his body.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Everyone watched as this monstrous mouth that suddenly grew on his shoulder sucked and devoured the Life Devouring Flames, including those that burned on the axe blade.</p>

  <p>Once all of the flames had been eaten, the golden axe became nothing more than an ordinary chunk of sharp metal.</p>

  <p>All Luo Zheng needed to do was exert a bit of strength before he was able to snap the huge axe in half!</p>

  <p>Everyone who witnessed this scene almost had their eyes pop right out of their sockets in surprise.</p>

  <p>'What is with that weird mouth that suddenly grew on his shoulder?</p>

  <p>How was that mouth able to devour the flames so easily?' they all couldn't help but wonder to themselves.</p>

  <p>Among the three Eternal Realm Hunters, Pearson was the most knowledgeable and also most scheming.</p>

  <p>When he saw what had happened, he surmised that Luo Zheng's body was able to adjust itself to all sorts of predicaments.</p>

  <p>So did that mean that he had also sorts of method that could correspond to defeating other theurgies?</p>

  <p>If that was the case then wouldn't that make him entirely omnipotent?</p>

  <p>It was merely a conjecture since Pearson had no way to prove it. Who knows? Maybe it was mere coincidence that Luo Zheng's body had the ability to restrain the Life Devouring Flames.</p>

  <p>However, he remembered the fact that Luo Zheng was also able to escape from the Black Sun with a strange physical form. Was that also a coincidence then?</p>

  <p>There seemed to be too many coincidences in this world.</p>

  <p>Pearson thought it through but couldn't come up with a sound hypothesis as of the moment. 'Maybe Sawyer and Thurston made the right choice to follow him?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, more power of space surged across the sky as multiple giant axes began to rain down upon them in succession!</p>
