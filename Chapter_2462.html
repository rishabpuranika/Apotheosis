  <p>Duke just stood still there, saying nothing.</p>

  <p>How could he leave before completing his task?</p>

  <p>But he could not tell the others what was playing on his mind.</p>

  <p>He had just encouraged them to return together. Now, he himself was refusing to leave. This put him in an embarrassing position.</p>

  <p>He glared at Luo Zheng, as a killing intention surged in his heart.</p>

  <p>"How about we kill them now?"</p>

  <p>Wesley asked Duke using his life vitality.</p>

  <p>In Wesley's opinion, they had an advantage right now.</p>

  <p>Duke was more powerful than any ordinary top-rank True God. Tyrone and Ellis were not weak either, and the members of the alliance of the wealthy clans would be on their side.</p>

  <p>Wesley thought that they could solve the problem swiftly.</p>

  <p>'Now?'</p>

  <p>Duke thought to himself with a hint of apprehension. He had hoped to find a suitable opportunity.</p>

  <p>However, while being under siege from the sea of snakes, Yan and her brother chased the Snake Spirit and ran away, while Duke and the others got trapped by the sea of snakes.</p>

  <p>More importantly, he had got a very dangerous feeling from Yan from the very beginning. The sword array of the eleven people from the Sword Clan should not be underestimated either. What was more, Luo Zheng had a powerful avatar.</p>

  <p>"No, this is not the right time," Duke answered telepathically.</p>

  <p>The safest way would be to lure out the fiend, and then the fiend was strong enough to kill everyone present there.</p>

  <p>This thought brought a smile to Duke's face and he suddenly changed his attitude. "In fact, Luo Zheng, you are right. There must be some secrets in the debate venue. Now that we are here, it will be disgraceful to return like this!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he began to retract the aura that had been spreading out.</p>

  <p>"Duke! What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of them?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is so arrogant. Let's take him on together. It won't be difficult for us to kill him."</p>

  <p>The True Gods from the alliance of wealthy clans were now burning with rage.</p>

  <p>Although they entered the debate venue with Duke, he hadn't let them in on his plan.</p>

  <p>After all, not every True God had the courage to sacrifice their own life. If they knew that everyone in the debate venue was sure to die, how many would have actually come?</p>

  <p>"We still have a chance to go back right now."</p>

  <p>"Duke, didn't you want to quit just now?</p>

  <p>Then why did you change your mind?"</p>

  <p>Those grassroots True Gods were also very disappointed with Duke.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng seized this opportunity to add fuel to the fire. He asked, "Do you wish to return with a man who goes back on his words so frivolously? Besides, do you think he is on your side? So naive!"</p>

  <p>Duke was incensed at Luo Zheng's accusations.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng humiliate him like this?</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to tolerate it, so he gritted his teeth while he fumed inside. 'Luo Zheng, let's wait and watch. When you see that fiend, you'll know how stupid your choice is!'</p>

  <p>After the Multiple Antennae Snake had stopped releasing the red light, they continued to advance further.</p>

  <p>This time, they didn't follow the original route given by Reinhard, but instead, they decided to change their direction as per Luo Zheng's suggestion.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, when this troop was led by Reinhard, they headed towards the end of the debate venue according to the established route. The wedge-shaped path was not complicated.</p>

  <p>The new leader of this team was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And his goal was to explore the debate venue instead of going straight to the end.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you sure that there are some mysteries that we don't know about in the debate venue?" Reinhard asked feeling uncertain.</p>

  <p>The amazing thing was that he himself was not sure about it.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied and laughed. Reinhard was speechless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately added, "But I do feel that if we walk forward directly, there's no chance of obtaining the inheritance at all!"</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of the Multiple Antennae Snake?" Reinhard asked again.</p>

  <p>The Multiple Antennae Snake was powerful, but it was not like they didn't have any solution for it.</p>

  <p>As for Atlas, half of his body had been cut off by Luo Zheng's sword. He was seriously injured. Normally, the debate venue would not be as challenging as they thought, so they might still have a chance.</p>

  <p>"By the way, did you hear what Atlas said before?" Luo Zheng asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"No. What did he say?" Reinhard was so nervous back then that he hadn't heard what Atlas said.</p>

  <p>"He took my sister away to present her to his master," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"He has a master?" Reinhard exclaimed in shock.</p>

  <p>It was hard to believe that Atlas, a vicious man, would bow to anyone.</p>

  <p>If there was an existence that could be regarded a master by this savage creature, they were doomed as there was no way they could fight such a character.</p>

  <p>"It's not Atlas alone that made me come to this conclusion. So I think that there must be some mysteries in the debate venue. As for whether or not we can find out, it entirely depends on our luck," Luo Zheng said lightly.</p>

  <p>This was how Luo Zheng's mind worked after he was born in the universe.</p>

  <p>As the old saying went, "Man proposes but God disposes."</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't remedy the current situation, he had to find another way.</p>

  <p>'If I can't do anything about it, I will try my best so that I have no regret!'</p>

  <p>Although the debate venue was inside the Sword Clan's territory, the clan's Holy Beings had only explored this place twice. They were powerful enough by themselves, and did not need to rely on the avatars formed by the Truth of Goodwill, so the Holy Beings would ignore the avatars.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng naturally assumed that the key to solving this problem was with the avatars.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was leading the Sword Clan members, Duke and his group followed him helplessly, while the grassroots True Gods were even more helpless.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Lightning flashed, followed by the rumble of thunder.</p>

  <p>Atlas appeared in front of Edmond out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>There was a giant cyan bird in Edmond's enormous hand.</p>

  <p>It was the famous Nether Hawk in the Swirl Forest. The Nether Hawk was not as fierce as it appeared, but it flew very fast.</p>

  <p>It could track down some True Gods by following them for days and nights.</p>

  <p>It was very difficult to get rid of this bird.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Nether Hawk could release a powerful death intent while tracing a True God. A black smoke would encircle the True God.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, it would not cause any damage to the True God, but if the black smoke lasted for three days or so, no matter how strong the True God was, they would die without any resistance.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if a True God was being targeted by a Nether Hawk, they would certainly kill it, or else, they would be the one to be killed.</p>

  <p>Currently, there was a strong black smoke rising from the shoulder of Edmond, the fiend, but this Nether Hawk might not have the chance to kill him. He just pinched the Nether Hawk slightly and it let out a bitter cry.</p>

  <p>Then Edmond popped the bird into his mouth and began chewing it.</p>

  <p>"Ugh, it tastes awful!"</p>

  <p>Edmond said with a frown.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was an unimaginably terrifying place in the divine land, and yet it was much better than this damned place!</p>

  <p>After swallowing the Nether Hawk, Edmond remarked, "You seem to be injured."</p>

  <p>Atlas nodded respectfully and replied forlornly, "I was hurt by a low-rank True God."</p>

  <p>"A low-rank True God?" Edmond was surprised. "Tell me, what have you found?"</p>

  <p>"This place is indeed very strange. All my killing intentions are aimed at a group of top-rank True Gods in this damned place!" Atlas had a dubious look on his face. "I feel we exist because of them!"</p>
