<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The chances these Godly Geniuses had in condensing their Godly Tiles in such a short period of time were slim in Holy Jay's opinion.</p>

  <p>The heaviest burden of saving the Evolutionary Universe still had to be carried by Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Xenia.</p>

  <p>The most important part of Mike's plan was Luo Luo Zheng. He had already laid out everything for him. He picked a great world and made the necessary arrangements including creating the entire Luo Clan where Luo Luo Zheng could grow and experience paternal love.</p>

  <p>This went the same for Tianming and Xenia. Mike had a certain degree of control over things and used it to give the two some advantage. Tianming, for example, had the heritage of the Lord of Weapons while Xenia had the heritage of the extraordinary creature.</p>

  <p>With the three of them occupying the top three positions, Nathan came at a close fourth since the Xuanyuan Clan remained the strongest faction amongst Mike's disciples.</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay, have you seen Mu Ning?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>He'd been thinking of her ever since he entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. She wasn't weak but her temper often led her to trouble which made Luo Luo Zheng a little worried.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared on Holy Jay's face. "Mu Ning is still somewhere in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land."</p>

  <p>"What happened to her?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in concern when he saw the look on Holy Jay's face.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay was a genuine Holy Being. It required quite a serious matter for him to show such an expression.</p>

  <p>It seemed Mu Ning might have caused quite a stir wherever she was.</p>

  <p>Each of the ten Godly Geniuses had a role to play. Luo Luo Zheng was the main character and an indispensable existence in this universe. Tianming was the assassin who could deliver the most fatal blow. Xenia had other uses.</p>

  <p>Nathan, meanwhile, was Luo Zheng's alternate.</p>

  <p>Despite the meticulous planning Mike had done, there was bound to be a couple of accidents along the way. If, in the worst-case scenario, Luo Luo Zheng died then Nathan would replace him.</p>

  <p>Of course, the ten Godly Geniuses did not know about this. Not even Wynn, Mike's disciple knew. It was only Holy Jay and Bromley who were privy on this matter.</p>

  <p>If this news was ever made public then the Supreme Lord of Original Sin would no doubt do everything in his power to kill Luo Luo Zheng and have Nathan take his place.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had the most special role in all of this. As per Mike's request, Holy Jay had to help her become a world lord while establishing the Purple Power World in her body. Unfortunately, he hadn't succeeded yet.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't entirely his fault. Mu Ning simply refused to cooperate.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay couldn't help but feel quite embarrassed. He was a Holy Being yet he couldn't even deal with a little girl. The number of times he was tempted to just snatch her soul and tamper with her memories was high.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was indeed very stubborn. Back in the Purple Power World, her potential was activated under Apeiron's care and guidance. How could Holy Jay have the mood and patience to coax her?</p>

  <p>"I will send her back to the Evolutionary Universe soon, don't worry,"</p>

  <p>Holy Jay assured Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With this promise, Luo Luo Zheng found himself feeling more at ease.</p>

  <p>The other Godly Geniuses also wanted to go home. They were really worried about the situation in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Before sending them all off, Holy Jay saw it fit to impart a few words.</p>

  <p>"Holy Mike poured in a lot of effort for the ten of you. All of you are theoretically qualified to become True Gods but that will take quite some time. In the divine land, not even the children of Holy Beings get this same treatment. If you can help the Evolutionary Universe survive this round of crisis then in the future... We will meet again in the divine land!"</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded after Holy Jay's speech.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race had been preparing their entrance to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for such a long time. Meanwhile, all Holy Jay had to do was lift a finger.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe...</p>

  <p>A bright yellow crack appeared in the sky!</p>

  <p>A figure then burst forth from the crack and fell down!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found himself smashing at the side of a tall mountain!</p>

  <p>His body acted like a huge axe that directly split the mountain apart, leaving behind a thousand-feet-wide crack on its surface.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slipped into the crack and fell into an underground lake that had been formed by the torrential rain that currently poured from the heavens.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure quickly shot out of the water and returned to the aboveground. When he lifted his head, his eyes quickly widened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>The clouds were blood-red as if formed from countless drops of fresh blood. Even the distant mountains and plains looked as if they had been soaked by gallons upon gallons of dark-red blood.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have been teleported to a strange area. It seemed that his return this time around wouldn't be smooth as he had hoped.</p>

  <p>However, he was thrown back by Holy Jay himself. What reason did he have to send Luo Luo Zheng into such a strange place?</p>

  <p>Perhaps there was an accident that caused this deviation.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng held out a finger and caught a drop of blood-red rain. He held it up his nose and immediately recognized the familiar, metallic scent of blood.</p>

  <p>"It's real human blood," he murmured with a frown.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the situation was even worse than what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>He didn't even know which supreme world he had fallen into.</p>

  <p>A warship suddenly shot out from the sky, distracting Luo Luo Zheng from his thoughts. This warship was completely black and covered with sharp thorns. It boomed loudly every now and then and was coming straight towards him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng simply floated in mid-air. He did not know which side this warship belonged to so he opted to just wait.</p>

  <p>His guess was right.</p>

  <p>The warship seemed to have noticed the violent commotion caused by Luo Zheng's arrival and had come to check things out.</p>

  <p>This warship belonged to the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"This human blood really stinks. How long will we continue to withstand this?" one of the warriors complained.</p>

  <p>"We've already crushed these ants to death. Why is it necessary to have their blood splatter all over the ground?"</p>

  <p>"Stop complaining! The lord has his reasons."</p>

  <p>"What happened just now? How in the world did this huge mountain split into two?!"</p>

  <p>Despite what happened though, the Sacred race members weren't too alert. Ever since entering the Evolutionary Universe, they had gone through the human forces that tried to resist them effortlessly like a hot knife to butter. They were unstoppable.</p>

  <p>Their race managed to sweep this entire universe with ease without any losses.</p>

  <p>"Human!"</p>

  <p>"Tsk! Is this human an idiot? He doesn't even know how to run. When did humans become so obedient?"</p>

  <p>Several of the Sacred race members roared in laughter.</p>

  <p>One of them sized Luo Luo Zheng up. He was a bit more cautious than the others.</p>

  <p>"Everyone be careful, that guy... seems to be a world lord."</p>

  <p>These warriors of Sacred race were all at the Spirit Transformation Realm which meant fighting with a world lord was still going to be difficult for them.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?! How could a world lord dare to enter this place?" one of the warriors asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>The supreme world they were in had long since been occupied by the Sacred race. Any human world lord that entered this area subjected themselves to a death sentence.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the Sacred race warriors were not afraid. Luo Luo Zheng was a mere human and the Sacred race felt nothing but disgust for him.</p>

  <p>"He came here to surrender, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>The past three years hadn't been kind. Whether it was a Supreme Lord or an ordinary warrior, all of them had been pushed back by the Sacred race. Hundreds of world lords had already chosen to surrender, with some even betraying their own races to join the victors.</p>

  <p>A human world lord who suddenly appeared in front of them might mean that he was here to surrender, hence the black warship changed course and headed straight for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
