<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1241 Amber's Return </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The streak of light was extremely fast as it approached the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Both Lacey and Chantel breathed huge sighs of relief the moment they realized who that streak of light was.</p>

  <p>It was Amber! Her arrival gave them hope but, at the same time, made them question just what kind of ability Zheng had to be able to foretell her return. Could he see the future or something?</p>

  <p>Even Esther, who stood nearby, was equally perplexed. She then remembered the other time when Zheng had exhibited such a skill. When he fought with Saroyan, Zheng had been able to find out how long his opponent had lived accurately down to the number of the days. He also seemed to be aware of everything that went on in this great world. Was he, perhaps, an incarnation of an omnipotent deity?</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Their thoughts were interrupted by Amber's frantic advance, her light purple robe swishing behind her as she drew closer. The anger on her face was very apparent when she saw the scene that awaited her.</p>

  <p>Since the fellows from the Dread Ogre Sacred Place dared to chase after her, she surmised that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place would definitely attack the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. She knew that Lacey and Chantel would not be able to stop the invasion just by themselves.</p>

  <p>Thick smoke rose above the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, deepening her frown. If it was really destroyed, then she swore to kill every single ogre from both the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place even if it cost her life.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the sight of Lacey and Chantel unharmed calmed her heart especially when she saw a familiar, white-robed human youth.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>The sight of Zheng clarified her thoughts. The Heavenly Feather Sacred Place's victory against the ogres' invasion definitely had something to do with him.</p>

  <p>"Amber!"</p>

  <p>Both Lacey and Chantel greeted her with joy once she arrived. "Amber, are you alright? The Dread Ogre Sacred Place knew about your movements and they took advantage of the fact that you were undergoing tribulation…"</p>

  <p>"You mean these three fellows?" Amber asked and suddenly held up three large heads in her hand. One of them was the leader of the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>All of them were at the Soul Sea Realm and had died by Amber's hands.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled, realizing how valiant Amber really was. Not only did she safely pass through the Big Heavenly Tribulation, she had also been able to kill the three Soul Sea Realm ogres that had come to possibly eliminate her during her most vulnerable state.</p>

  <p>She casually threw the heads away and headed for Zheng. She almost froze midway when she caught a glimpse of Dorothea and Woody standing behind him.</p>

  <p>She would never admit it but the sight of those two scared her slightly.</p>

  <p>Their aura was extremely powerful given that they were obviously Spirit Supreme Realm warriors. She figured that they were the ones responsible for reversing their situation. Zheng was extremely talented but she knew that he would still be unable to face against mighty Soul Sea Realm warriors even after breaking through to the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Amber's gaze was on them as she spoke, "Zheng, just now…"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in confirmation as he gestured to the two behind him. "We have to thank my two friends here for their help."</p>

  <p>Amber immediately knelt down on one knee in front of Dorothea and Woody. "Thank you so much! My clan will forever be grateful!"</p>

  <p>Dorothea looked indifferent but Woody laughed out loud. "Don't mention it! You've been recognized by the Celestial Position, right?" Woody asked.</p>

  <p>Amber stood up and her eyes flashed upon hearing Woody's words. "The Celestial Position? Are you talking about the Talent Tablet?"</p>

  <p>Woody nodded. "I can feel the Celestial Position's mark on your body. If I'm not wrong, you should be in the second row?"</p>

  <p>Amber nodded in affirmation. Besides Zheng, she was the only person who managed to place herself in the second row and had been marked by the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>"That's great then! You and I are of the same race," Woody cheerfully told her.</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled his eyes at this. He had also been recognized by the Celestial Position but never received such friendly treatment from Woody.</p>

  <p>Following the exchange, Amber quickly learned the purpose of Zheng's visit and immediately instructed Lacey and Chantel to clean up the mess of their sacred place while she helped them gather the materials. Under Dorothea's guide, the five people on the Eight-diagram Wheel also went over to enter the holy tree with Amber.</p>

  <p>Hank quickly gave Amber a list but she felt somewhat embarrassed when she looked at it. Most of the materials were readily available in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, and some could be procured within a day or two, but there were a few that she had never heard of before.</p>

  <p>Woody, however, sighed in understanding, "I know. The Lower World lacks resources. Hank, replace some of the materials."</p>

  <p>Hank took back the list. It was fortunate that he was a master puppeteer and was able to come up with a few alternatives on the spot. Once he was done, he handed it back to Amber who figured that it would take around one to two days to collect all the materials they needed.</p>

  <p>The seven Celestial Position members would have to rest in the Demon Night's place for the time being.</p>

  <p>It was around that time that Miguel arrived, having rushed over from the Purple Heart Sacred Place. The news of the ogres' invasion had reached the humans a bit late and, by the time they arrived, things had already settled down.</p>

  <p>Amber, on the other hand, couldn't help but feel depressed once she saw the extent of the damage. The Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had taken quite a beating and was charred here and there.</p>

  <p>Miguel quickly went to console her. "Let's exterminate the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place!" he declared fiercely.</p>

  <p>The battle earlier had killed all the mighty warriors of both ogre sacred places. The Purple Heart Sacred Place alone would now be able to completely annihilate the ogres if they wished.</p>

  <p>Amber nodded at his words before turning to Zheng, "Zheng, I would like to know how my queen is."</p>

  <p>The light from Xun's statue had almost completely faded some time ago. Amber was beside herself with worry, thinking that their queen had perished or something. However, just as it had almost dissipated, the light gradually stabilized and was now gradually recovering. Still, Amber remained wary.</p>

  <p>If she wasn't about to undergo the Big Heavenly Tribulation, then she would've gone all the way to Central Region to see Zheng just to inquire about Xun's well-being.</p>

  <p>Zheng took out a brown branch and Amber's eyes immediately widened.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Nurturing Wood!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Her heart immediately dropped at the sight of the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>This extraordinary branch was used to help someone hold on to his or her last breath of life, which meant that Xun, right now, was in a critically ill state.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was also filled with grief. "Xun blocked a soul attack for me. Her soul was on the verge of collapsing so I had no other choice but to place her inside the Soul Nurturing Wood."</p>

  <p>Amber gritted her teeth. "Let's use the holy tree's life force again. It would at least be able to awaken our queen."</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, shook his head. "I don't think that's going to work."</p>

  <p>The entire Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was terribly devastated from the battle. If they wanted to restore it to its former glory, they would have to rely on the holy tree's power.</p>

  <p>Right now, the huge holy tree was riddled with holes and if they used it on Xun now, it would probably drain it of its power.</p>

  <p>"My queen is more important. I can feel the holy tree's will and it is willing to sacrifice itself to save her!" Amber insisted.</p>

  <p>Zheng could only sigh. "Xun is like this because of me. I'll find a way to revive her," he said. "Besides, the nourishment of the holy tree alone will not be enough to completely repair her damaged soul."</p>

  <p>The power of the Soul Nurturing Wood in his hand wasn't any weaker than that of the holy tree. Its effects, however, were slower but it was enough to protect Xun's soul.</p>

  <p>Just then, they were interrupted by a yellow-robed Demon Night girl who bowed down to Amber.</p>

  <p>"Ailsa, what is it?" Ailsa was a third-level war sage so Amber was curious why she was here.</p>
