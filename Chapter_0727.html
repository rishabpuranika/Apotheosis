<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Treasures like the Heavenly Feather Crown bestowed cultivators with special powers.</p>

  <p>For example, it could amplify the Law Power of some Laws. Similarly, wearing the crown would raise one's cultivation speed.</p>

  <p>Another example would be the Time Copper Coin owned by the World Commercial Alliance. It contained a trace of Time Law. If a person wore it for cultivation, he could gain an additional six hours per day.</p>

  <p>One should not underestimate these six hours. A cultivator's lifespan was very long. These six hours when accumulated over several decades and several centuries could increase a cultivator's lifespan significantly. The Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance was able to live such a long life because of this Time Copper Coin.</p>

  <p>However, these effects were not as direct as a weapon's or protective equipment's.</p>

  <p>Protective equipment determined the cultivator's life, while weapons determined his opponent's.</p>

  <p>However, owning weapons was not enough. After all, if a cultivator lost his life, then what was the use of collecting sacred weapons?</p>

  <p>Protective garment of the sacred level, on the other hand, could block the enemy's attack effectively. It could even save the cultivator's life.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on with Luo Zheng? He seems to have endless secrets!"</p>

  <p>Amongst the three leaders, Hobbes was the most impatient.</p>

  <p>Dillon smiled helplessly. "Cloud Hall is lucky to have someone like him.</p>

  <p>Looks like it's already certain that Cloud Hall will become a fifth-grade sect."</p>

  <p>In the past few years, Cloud Hall had been working hard to become a fifth-grade sect, and it had almost completely accumulated sufficient strength. As long as Ning Yudie mastered Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, the chances of her breaking through the Virtual Tribulation Realm would be very high. After she broke through, Cloud Hall's status as a fifth-grade sect would be a certainty. What was more, Cloud Hall would be on a par with Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>However, now Cloud Hall had found a talent in Luo Zheng, who had mastered the Perfect Brushwork. He would become the most powerful runic expert in the Central Region in the future.</p>

  <p>Just being a runic expert was insufficient. After all, a runic expert was not a martial artist. Although a runic expert could significantly boost Cloud Hall's reputation, it would not help them rise to the level of a fifth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was different from ordinary runic experts. After all, he had grasped the first layer of Fire Law entirely.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he was also a body refiner, and it was rare to see a body that was as strong as his.</p>

  <p>Now, just to embarrass Eden, he had casually taken out a sacred weapon-level protective garment.</p>

  <p>The three leaders were already confused. Many thoughts raced through their minds. 'How can someone be so strong? What has happened to this world?'</p>

  <p>Were Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivators like them not the strongest anymore? When did an Illuminating Soul Realm cultivator in the Central Region become so strong?</p>

  <p>They weren't even sure of the level of Zheng's talent!</p>

  <p>Despite being at the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, he had easily defeated an elite disciple of Bloodwood Cliff. Zheng's talent was already undeniable— it was impossible to estimate it! Since he had beaten an Internal Elixir Realm cultivator while still in the Illuminating Soul Realm, wouldn't he challenge the Virtual Tribulation Realm after he had entered the Internal Elixir Realm?</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Lady Poison-blood of Bloodwood Cliff frowned. Women got jealous easily. Even though Ning Yudie was younger than her by a few hundred years, age had never been a problem in the world of cultivators.</p>

  <p>Even though she was also the leader of a fourth-grade sect, two people rushed to give Ning Yudie sacred weapons. Lady Poison-blood could only be said to have gone mad with jealousy, and she felt even more upset about this than when Luo Zheng defeated her disciple!</p>

  <p>As for Eddie, he too glared at Luo Zheng as his heart filled with doubt.</p>

  <p>"This kid called Luo Zheng is very familiar. Very familiar. But I can't remember where I might have seen him before." As the strongest cultivator in the Central Region, Eddie was calm and steady. Even though Luo Zheng had embarrassed his son by using a sacred weapon, he would not show any signs of anger.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard he tried, Eddie could not remember where he had seen Luo Zheng. He was so confused.</p>

  <p>Eden tightly gripped the Heavenly Feather Crown in his hands. Although the light emanating from it was reflected in his eyes, yet it seemed so ironic.</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt that it was too embarrassing to continue holding the crown. But he could neither drop it nor continue to hold it.</p>

  <p>It would make him look petty if he were to drop it. Moreover, how could he bear to lose a sacred weapon of such value? Yet, he would face endless ridicule if he kept it. "You treasure something that is worthless to another.</p>

  <p>How embarrassing it is!" they would say.</p>

  <p>In the end, a smile appeared on Eden's face as he mocked himself. "Since my gift does not please you, I shall not pursue the matter. In the future, after my strength has improved significantly, I hope that I can obtain your favor."</p>

  <p>"Good! That's my son! He is neither humble nor arrogant but resilient and ambitious!" Eddie suddenly laughed so loudly that everyone could hear him. His words were good enough to salvage some of Eden's reputation.</p>

  <p>Eddie knew that his son had been humiliated when his proposal was rejected. However, Eddie considered the experience to be an inspiring story of enduring humiliation. He was not worried about Eden's marriage.</p>

  <p>"Father, I want to surpass you. If I can't even take on such a small task, how can I excel?" A confident smile crept over Eden's face. He then leaped up and firmly stood on the stage. He said to Benson, "Now that this matter is over, let's get back to business. Benson, our fight will continue!"</p>

  <p>Although Eden had a smile on his face, when his gaze shifted to Luo Zheng, a trace of viciousness appeared in his eyes. Eden had never been a magnanimous person.</p>

  <p>However, it would be beneath him to challenge Luo Zheng face-to-face. A divine-level talent with a cultivation level of the Internal Elixir Realm should not be challenging a fourth-level Illuminating Soul Realm disciple! If he did so, what kind of divine-level talent was he?</p>

  <p>Although it was not practical for him to challenge Luo Zheng, that didn't mean that Eden would let Luo Zheng off the hook. He decided that Luo Zheng had to die in the Martial Arts Contest!</p>

  <p>Eden had never considered that Luo Zheng would be thinking the same thing— to use the challenge card on Eden!</p>

  <p>Directly challenging Marilyn would arouse Eddie's suspicions. Luo Zheng wondered whether Eddie had already begun to suspect his identity. He hoped that Eddie wouldn't connect the dots.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng defeated Eden and then challenged Marilyn, it would make sense. As a disciple of Cloud Hall, and because of the conflict between him and Eddie, it would be understandable for Luo Zheng to challenge Marilyn. In fact, if Luo Zheng defeated Eden, she would challenge him, thus making things easier for Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>This was the biggest reason why Luo Zheng had chosen to stand out.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie didn't think that far ahead. Ice mist covered her face as she leaned back in the large chair. There was a trace of doubt in her eyes. 'This guy... how many more secrets does he have?' Although she was the leader of Cloud Hall, she was unable to see through Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall's Benson had long since considered Eden to be a pain in the ass.</p>

  <p>Seeing Eden standing on the stage, he also jumped off the platform!</p>

  <p>Just as Benson stood on the stage, a strange scene appeared. Ripples began to spread out from under his feet! It was as if the entire fighting arena were filled with water!</p>

  <p>"It's the Water Law Power! Benson mainly cultivates the water-system cultivation method! He seems to have comprehended 60% of Water Law!"</p>

  <p>"This Martial Arts Contest is truly worth being present for. A vast majority of martial artists have comprehended Law Power!"</p>

  <p>"What about Eden? What cultivation method does he use?"</p>

  <p>Eden's expression was calm as he stared at Benson indifferently. His thoughts were not on Benson at all.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Benson's strength was not worthy of his attention. In this Martial Arts Contest, the only person that could threaten him was the Ethereal Spirit Sect's Brent. As for the others, they were just a joke.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Benson drew his light blue sword and pointed it straight at Eden. "Eden, unsheathe your sword!"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had helped Cloud Hall save its reputation just now, Eden had shamelessly claimed that he wanted Ning Yudie to be his woman. This was intolerable, and in the hearts of the disciples of Cloud Hall, such a declaration was unforgivable.</p>

  <p>Eden sized up Benson's sword, as if it did not exist.</p>

  <p>However, one moment his expression was as calm as still water, while in the next, a ruthless Mu Ning gushed toward his relatively handsome face.</p>

  <p>He was already extremely dissatisfied, and Benson had dared to provoke him.</p>

  <p>An invisible Mu Ning suddenly burst forth from his body. The moment the Mu Ning enveloped him, several wind blades danced on Eden's fingers. Then, like a lion on the prairie, he suddenly lunged at Benson!</p>
