<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng had begun cultivating, he had never admitted defeat. He had never even thought of giving up despite being in dire straits.</p>

  <p>However, Turner, the emperor of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, could not hold it in.</p>

  <p>Turner was like Randy. Both were more loyal to friends, unlike the crown prince.</p>

  <p>This battle did not involve any huge interests. Victory or defeat was only a matter of fame. It was not like Turner would lose his throne if Luo Luo Zheng lost the battle. If that was how it worked, then it was not Luo Zheng's turn to represent the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng lost, it wouldn't be a big deal. He had already defeated Logan and Fiona, and had already earned the Harlen Divine Kingdom a lot of honor and pride.</p>

  <p>Besides the little monster, who else from the four divine kingdoms would dare to challenge Luo Luo Zheng? Those princes and princesses? They might be slightly stronger than Logan, but they were probably not even a match for Fiona. There was no way they could challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As for the little monster, he was a mystery to them. Even after so many years of studying, the masters at the Soul Sea Realm still hadn't solved the mystery of his origins. Judging from the beastly nature, he was definitely not human.</p>

  <p>And their guess was probably right. The little monster was not human.</p>

  <p>He was just the embodiment of the will of this world, and was called the son of this plane. It was equivalent to being a spokesperson of this great world.</p>

  <p>After witnessing the battle for a while, Turner was sure that there was no better way for Luo Luo Zheng to deal with the little monster. If this went on, the little monster would eat Luo Zheng's head. And this was not what Turner wanted to see.</p>

  <p>Randy heaved a long sigh of relief after he heard what his father said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's performance had already surpassed his expectations, and his goal had been achieved. Now, he was naturally worried that the little monster would kill Luo Luo Zheng. But since his father had stopped the battle, Luo Luo Zheng should be safe.</p>

  <p>But War Emperor York and Marine wore expressions that did not bode well. Marine said coldly to Turner, "Your Majesty, I'm afraid this does not look good."</p>

  <p>Turner looked at the Holy Maiden and asked with a smile, "This is just a friendly competition before we activate the entrance to the Feather Holy Sea. After so many years, it has slowly become a competition to review the strength of the younger generation of our four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Since it's just a competition, it's perfectly normal for players to admit defeat, right?"</p>

  <p>Marine was just a young girl. She was rather naive when compared to Turner. She was at a loss for words at his little speech.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York, however, sneered, "Turner, this guy just hurt Logan, the number one warrior among the younger generation in my York Divine Kingdom. Right now, he's competing with another warrior of the York Divine Kingdom. He's no match for the little monster, and yet he wants to leave the arena just like that. Don't you think this is unfair?"</p>

  <p>Turner knew that War Emperor York was unwilling to let Luo Luo Zheng off the hook. So he smiled and said, "When warriors compete with each other, there will be times when they will fail and get hurt. This is normal.</p>

  <p>Lucien Liu, I'm sure you understand this."</p>

  <p>War Emperor York laughed and said loudly and clearly, "The warriors of my York Divine Kingdom and your Harlen Divine Kingdom are in the midst of a battle. If Tianxing Luo admits defeat now, I believe he will also have some regret in his heart. To make sure that he doesn't regret anything, let's do this. Each of them can make only one move and the outcome of this battle will decide the winner. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Turner's face darkened with each word that War Emperor York said.</p>

  <p>'Lucien Liu has gone too far. I've already announced that the Harlen Divine Kingdom has been defeated, and I have admitted defeat on behalf of Tianxing Luo. But Lucien Liu still wants to let the two of them fight!</p>

  <p>What an ass!</p>

  <p>It might be just one move, but it could be brilliant on so many counts.</p>

  <p>After all, the little monster can't be measured based on common sense!'</p>

  <p>"I don't? " Turner began.</p>

  <p>But War Emperor York interrupted him and said, "Since both sides have no objections, let's begin!"</p>

  <p>The little monster leaned on the edge of the enchanted barrier and sneered at Luo Luo Zheng, "Did you hear that? One move! I still have one more chance. Ha-ha! One move is enough for me to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face was stoic, but his mind was racing. He had heard the conversation taking place outside the enchanted barrier. Although Turner had admitted defeat on his behalf in plain words, the fact was that Luo Luo Zheng was truly unwilling to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>The power of the little monster was indeed too great, but it didn't mean that Luo Luo Zheng had no way of breaking it. He just hadn't thought of it yet.</p>

  <p>Because War Emperor York had interfered, the two of them had to exchange a last blow. But how could he subdue the little monster in one move? This was also a test for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Most people present were guessing that Luo Luo Zheng would definitely rack his brains to think of a way to avoid fighting the little monster. Little had they known that Luo Luo Zheng would directly face the little monster instead of running away.</p>

  <p>There was a silence between the two for a few seconds during which neither moved. After that, the little monster suddenly said, "Are you ready?  Luo Luo Zheng Luo! I haven't shown this move to anyone, but this time, I'll let you have a taste of it. You can talk about it to the other ghosts after you die! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Amidst his own wild laughter, the little monster suddenly began to exude an astonishing Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>This Mu Ning was not like that of a human's. The little monster seemed to have transformed into a towering mountain. It was like a vast and boundless ocean, an endless plain, or a mysterious and bizarre swamp.</p>

  <p>No one could exactly tell.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning that the little monster was emitting was like that of the entire world.</p>

  <p>'This is... He is using the will of the entire world. No, he is the incarnation of the will of the world! He is using his will to suppress me!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought, his mouth hanging open in shock.</p>

  <p>The little monster's originally wretched and ugly temperament seemed to have suddenly undergone a shocking change. In that instant, he represented the world, and this was also a sign that the will of the world was gradually awakening. The more it awakened, the more control the little monster had over the world.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned, looking on at the little monster, transfixed.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning that the little monster was emitting was simply too enormous.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt themselves minuscule, like they were facing an enormous mountain, and before the majesty of its beauty, they looked and felt like ants.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the little monster's Mu Ning kept changing. Sometimes it would turn into a towering mountain, and sometimes it would turn into an unfathomable sea. These natural scenes were not something that humans could conquer.</p>

  <p>Although War Emperor York had sided with the little monster, this scene had also caused his face to darken. This was proof that the little monster had been suppressing his own strength in front of him and his cultivation level had been suppressed at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. War Emperor York hadn't expected his strength to have risen to this level. Just what the hell was the little monster?</p>

  <p>Even the other masters at the Soul Sea Realm felt uncomfortable. The little monster was too dangerous. Ever since the Nine Furnace Martial House had proposed to raise the little monster to the Soul Sea Realm, many people had objected, afraid that they would be raising a snake in their bosom. This guy was not human at all. If he grew up, it would become difficult to control him.</p>

  <p>Now that they had seen the little monster's Mu Ning bursting out, many of the masters at the Soul Sea Realm became even more worried. Although they could cultivate themselves with the help of the little monster's talent, what would happen if they couldn't control the little monster?</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a white light flashing in his mind and a multicolored will entering it.</p>

  <p>'He intends to use the will of the world to kill me?' Luo Luo Zheng thought, shocked.</p>

  <p>He did indeed possess a soul close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm, but even so, it might not be able to resist the will of the world.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could react, the colorful will crashed into Luo Zheng's soul ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>Under the impact, cracks suddenly appeared on Luo Zheng's originally sturdy soul.</p>

  <p>'What a strong willpower!' Luo Zheng's soul began to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Luo Luo Zheng, isn't your soul very powerful? Similar to that of a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm? Even stronger than that of a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm? But how can it counter my attack?" The colorful will turned towards Luo Luo Zheng and laughed maniacally. Although this will was the will of the great world, it did not awaken in the end. The little monster was still controlling it.</p>
