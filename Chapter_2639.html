<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2639 Run Towards His Enemy </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Four arrows shot from the darkness, three of which flew towards Emily and one aimed for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The exiles, however, were well-aware that the large races originally targeted Luther who was in the crowd, and not Emily.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luther was surrounded by several Wild Gods who formed a barricade around him. He was tightly guarded, which left little room for the enemy to attack.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the enemies had set their sights on Emily when they started to move.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, the exiles from the small races did not harbor a deep hatred towards Emily. Maybe they simply wanted to eliminate the most powerful person in the world with their own hands when the chance came.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Tyler's target was Luo Zheng, who was next to Emily.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, Luo Zheng, who had suddenly appeared when the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race had competed for the Sky South Bone Tower, had made Tyler's disciple David suffer too much. He later returned to the Pyramid Bone Tower, never to rise again.</p>

  <p>That was why Tyler deeply loathed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng displayed his mighty strength after the Strength Equalizing token was performed, which caused Tyler to be more fearful of him.</p>

  <p>Thus, he obviously wouldn't let go of the opportunity to kill his enemy.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted his long sword and went straight for a Wight's neck. Then, he stepped on its back and jumped high into the air.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he caught a glimpse of a few black rays of light from afar, and all of them flew at a high speed.</p>

  <p>"Watch out! There are hidden arrows being shot!" he warned Emily.</p>

  <p>He then reflexively twisted his body in the air and brandished his long sword at the same time. There was a crisp sound when the arrow that was aimed at him bounced away.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Emily had also noticed the three sharp arrows that were aimed at her when Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>Her sensibility had been greatly reduced when the Strength Equalizing token worked. Thus, she had only noticed the arrows when they were just about eight feet away from her.</p>

  <p>Her face darkened. She knew that she couldn't dodge, so she stretched out her hand and grabbed the Wight nearest to her. She quickly pulled it and the Wight blocked her in front.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>There were three muffled sounds? two arrows had stabbed the Wight's body, and one pierced through Emily's collarbone.</p>

  <p>A small stream of blood flowed from Emily's neck as she groaned in pain. She immediately cut the Wight's throat with her saber, and then hurriedly retreated.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! She is so quick!" said Tyler in shock. His hands quickly fumbled for another black arrow and quickly tightened the bowstring.</p>

  <p>The first round of assassination was very important. After all, the enemy had no idea about it, and thus they were not on high alert. That was why Spark assigned Tyler, one of the important people in their race, to lead the group.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to Spark that the four of them didn't do any significant harm to the enemy except slightly hurt Emily.</p>

  <p>Although the first round of arrows didn't kill anyone, all of them panicked when they saw that Emily was injured.</p>

  <p>"There are more hidden arrows being shot!"</p>

  <p>"Left front!"</p>

  <p>"Leave, now!"</p>

  <p>It was originally already quite difficult for them to fight against the Wights, and even more so if they still had to watch out for the hidden arrows. The pressure would just naturally increase, which was why they began to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic! I'll deal with those guys!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>After that, he swiftly jumped up once again and rushed forward alone!</p>

  <p>The dense pack of Wights ahead made Luo Zheng's figure look a bit strange. He constantly jumped from left to right and progressed in a rather weird path. It was the Sword Step, which he hadn't used for a long time.</p>

  <p>The Sword Step was just a kind of bodily movement skill that didn't need to be activated by life vitality. Of course, it could be played freely even with the restriction of the Strength Equalizing token. Each of his steps was three feet and three inches which was as long as a sword, but it was changeable and complicated.</p>

  <p>The brainless Wights rushed towards Luo Zheng, but they never got shorter than two inches away from him. He had passed by hundreds of the Wights in a row, but they never even touched his clothes.</p>

  <p>In the darkness, Tyler grimaced when he saw Luo Zheng had gotten closer to them.</p>

  <p>"Keep shooting!"</p>

  <p>The four men tightened their bowstrings and after he had given the order, fired the second round of arrows at Luo Zheng without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish!"</p>

  <p>Four beams of black light came and whistled in the air, all headed straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, moved along with the group of Wights at such a constant, high speed. How could they possibly shoot him?</p>

  <p>"Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof!"</p>

  <p>The air was filled with four shrill sounds, all from the four arrows that had hit some of the Wights instead.</p>

  <p>By that time, Luo Zheng was already about seven hundred feet away. He was now only one thousand feet away from where Tyler and his companions were hiding.</p>

  <p>"That's quick!"</p>

  <p>"This guy's bodily movement skill is really amazing!"</p>

  <p>"How could he cultivate an ordinary martial arts skill to such a degree?</p>

  <p>Does he know the Strength Equalizing token and did he prepare for this?"</p>

  <p>Now, the situation of the Wild Gods and the exiles was chaotic. They were afraid that no one could deal with the arrows being fired in the dark because Emily had been hurt. In the end, they chose to retreat.</p>

  <p>Tyler never expected that Luo Zheng could move so nimbly that he could freely traverse through the crowd of Wights, and left the archers with nothing to deal with.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, all the exiles were proficient in martial arts.</p>

  <p>Yet even in the Source World, ordinary martial arts were just the transitional product before the practice of the Grand World Cultivation Method. Only a small number of people, such as Emily, Timotheus, and Ramzi, were highly skilled in these martial arts.</p>

  <p>What they did not know was that there was no True God in the universes.</p>

  <p>Everyone got into the Divine Dao through practicing martial arts, and practicing martial arts was the basis of their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Mike could have forcefully raised Luo Zheng's cultivation base, but he didn't.</p>

  <p>Instead, he had created many training opportunities that pushed Luo Zheng to his limits in his inner world, and that made him who he was now.</p>

  <p>No one was sure if Mike had foreseen it, but at that moment, the martial arts that Luo Zheng had been cultivating did play an important role.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Wild Gods and the exiles were so excited to see Luo Zheng in action. It greatly boosted their spirits.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, stay in your formations. Don't panic," Emily ordered. She had already pulled out the arrow from her collarbone, but had to bear the sharp pain. Her eyes glowed strangely as she watched Luo Zheng's figure shuttle through the Wights.</p>

  <p>She had always led her team, and even the powerful Timotheus listened to her command.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't expect that Luo Zheng unconsciously played the dominant role now.</p>

  <p>"Shoot again!" Tyler yelled with gritted teeth as he abruptly waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Things had now gotten out of hand and it made him boil in anger.</p>

  <p>According to the original plan, they would never lose as long as those Wights caught up with Emily and her companions, while they attacked them with sharp arrows.</p>

  <p>He never thought that the inconspicuous youth called Luo Zheng would come to them alone!</p>

  <p>"Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof!"</p>

  <p>They shot four arrows simultaneously once more, but none of them even managed to hurt a hair of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill him with my own hands," Tyler yelled with a murderous look, and then drew out a saber from his waist.</p>
