<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathaniel had swallowed a Green Blood Pill before, which was known to be quite potent.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a consummate True God could quickly replenish their blood vitality if it was depleted after they'd taken the pill, let alone Nathaniel, a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>The Green Blood Pill worked constantly in his elixir field. It replenished his blood vitality and made it flourish even more.</p>

  <p>The current scene caused the people in the valley to be shocked when they saw it.</p>

  <p>Zheng lifted Nathaniel in mid-air. His body swayed with the wind as blood continued to gush out from it. A rain of bright red showered the valley like crazy, while numerous True Gods tried to dodge the liquid.</p>

  <p>"Nathaniel is bleeding heavily..."</p>

  <p>"The blood in his body has almost dried out, I guess?"</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. He just ate a Green Blood Pill to replenish blood vitality. But if it weren't for that pill, he would have become a mummy."</p>

  <p>The Green Blood Pill continued to work its magic amidst the rain of blood, and more people became stunned.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nelly's hands were behind her back as her round eyes stared at Zheng. Her usually sharp face became the slightest bit soft when she smiled.</p>

  <p>Although she mainly practiced the Murdering Godly Way, she never thought that the Blood Breaking Bite could be used like this. The Blood Breaking Bite was indeed a good skill, but it was usually used to prevent one's opponent from escaping. Now, Zheng completely depended on the Blood Breaking Bite and planned to drain Nathaniel's blood.</p>

  <p>The Green Blood Pill did constantly replenish Nathaniel's blood vitality, but the speed of his blood loss was much faster than the rate at which it was being refilled.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Nathaniel's face was gradually drained of color, until he was as white as a sheet.</p>

  <p>He tried to cut off the intangible vines at his feet, but the vines from the Long Vine Sword clung tightly on the lower part of his body. In order to cut those transparent and intangible vines off, he was afraid that he might have to sacrifice his lower body.</p>

  <p>His achievements in the Earth Godly Way were almost invincible like Zheng had said, and he still had several kinds of theurgy that he had yet to show. Now, however, he had lost his chance to turn the tables because Zheng had locked him in his grip.</p>

  <p>More and more blood spurted out from his body, and he felt like his whole being was slipping away. Panic filled his eyes. He would die if he didn't stop bleeding.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Holy Beings outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land were amused and shocked by such an astonishing sight.</p>

  <p>Nicholas stared at Nathaniel for a while, and then told Soren using his life vitality, "Soren, stop that guy! Don't kill him, or he'll kill Nathaniel."</p>

  <p>Earlier, Nicholas had told Soren to stay out of Zheng and Nathaniel's fight.</p>

  <p>Soren would never go against Nicholas' words. He would also never take action even if he had to watch Zheng kill Nathaniel, his brother.</p>

  <p>But since Nicholas now told him to stop Zheng, he quickly nodded.</p>

  <p>Before he could do anything, however, Reginald, who stood beside him, suddenly stretched his hand out and blocked his way. "You said you wouldn't do anything," he said in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>Reginald's eyes burned fierily. Zheng had saved his life. He couldn't possibly watch Soren fight against Zheng. If Soren really wanted to kill Zheng, Reginald would surely make a move.</p>

  <p>Soren just smiled and did not care about Reginald. "Don't worry, I'm not going to kill him. The Holy Emperor of our clan told me to stop the fight. He wants to accept Tianxing as his disciple. I won't dare kill that guy, or else, the Holy Emperor of our clan will never forgive me!"</p>

  <p>When he was done, he flew straight towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Doubt clouded Reginald's mind as he didn't know if Soren was telling the truth or just lying. He still followed Soren though. If Soren tried to kill Zheng, Reginald would stop him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng continued to wield the Long Vine Sword. He dragged the earth under Nathaniel's feet, and then swayed left and right in the air.</p>

  <p>A stream of Nathaniel's blood splashed on the ground like red ink.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>At that moment, goose bumps rose on his skin at the sudden blast of cold wind, and he almost subconsciously dodged to the side.</p>

  <p>The person who came for him was surprisingly fast. As soon as he turned around, he felt someone tightly grasp his hand, where he felt an extremely cold aura came from. The aura went into his arm.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng finally noticed that the man in front of him was Soren, Nathaniel's elder brother.</p>

  <p>"Stop! If you kill a member of the Dongfang Clan, you will never have a chance to get away with it alive," said Soren calmly.</p>

  <p>He had a firm grip on Zheng's arm, which won his brother a little bit of rest. Most of Nathaniel's blood, however, was gone and he couldn't move smoothly. He stood there weakly, still entangled with the Long Vine Sword.</p>

  <p>"He robbed my divine might coins and wanted to kill me. He deserves to die," Zheng said just as coolly.</p>

  <p>"But you can't kill him because I'm here," Soren replied with a faint smile. He increased his hold on Zheng's arm; the chilling sensation flowed even more into it and immediately froze half of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a pure white flame flew out of Zheng's arm. After the Ice Soul Flame appeared, it quickly burned through Soren's hand.</p>

  <p>"The Ice Soul Flame?" Soren was surprised.</p>

  <p>That type of ice flame was known to be a kind of extremely powerful theurgy.</p>

  <p>It was driven by chaotic energy, which gave it its terrifying power.</p>

  <p>An ordinary low-rank True God could barely resist the Ice Soul Flame, and it was a huge deal for even a mid-rank True God. Then again, Soren was a top-rank True God. His eyes glowed and his arm emitted white ice crystals.</p>

  <p>The ice crystals turned into countless ice bugs and rapidly rushed towards Zheng's Ice Soul Flame.</p>

  <p>There was an incredible reaction of two very different extremely cold powers as soon as the ice bugs made contact with the Ice Soul Flame. It turned out that the ice bugs quickly absorbed the immensely cold power in the Ice Soul Flame.</p>

  <p>The tiny ice bugs, which were originally as thin as toothpicks, immediately swelled after they absorbed the Ice Soul Flame. After they had consumed a certain amount, they all fell to the ground and quickly turned into small ice cocoons.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he continued to release the Ice Soul Flame without stop. At the same time, Soren urged the ice bugs to devour the Ice Soul Flame.</p>

  <p>The cocoons that fell on the ground soon broke apart; then the things inside them turned into snow-white ice butterflies. The butterflies had translucent wings with beautiful patterns made up of icy crystals.</p>

  <p>All of the ice butterflies flew and gathered behind Soren. Apparently, he controlled all of those ice butterflies.</p>

  <p>The air around them grew colder as the more Ice Soul Flame Zheng released, the more butterflies Soren created, which was in Soren's favor.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste your energy anymore. Let me give you the divine might coins, okay?" Soren said consolingly. Zheng's eyes glinted in the light.</p>

  <p>His brows were furrowed as he sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>It was truly difficult for him to fight against a top-rank True God with his current strength.</p>

  <p>Soren noticed the change in Zheng's expression and smiled, "Maybe we will be family in the future..."</p>

  <p>"Brother! Kill that idiot!" someone shouted. It was Nathaniel, who had finally regained his strength and quickly turned against Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Soren, however, mentally cursed him for his words. 'My idiotic brother…'</p>

  <p>Anger began to fill Zheng as he glared at Nathaniel with a malicious aura in his eyes. An extremely violent energy started to brew in his body.</p>

  <p>He couldn't fully control the raging energy. Hundreds of streams of internal momentum intertwined and gave off a terrifying aura.</p>

  <p>The aura didn't really spread that far, so Nathaniel, who was in mid-air, wasn't aware of it. Neither was Reginald, who was ten feet behind Soren.</p>

  <p>Only Soren was the closest to Zheng, and there was a hint of true fear in his eyes when he smelled the rabid momentum.</p>

  <p>He immediately let go of Zheng's arm and retreated at an outstanding speed, way back to the side of the valley. His legs stood upright on the mountain wall and his whole body was on high alert. He looked wide-eyed at Zheng, as if he had seen a ghost.</p>
