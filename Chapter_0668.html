<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't think of a better explanation for the disappearance of the huge Owl Beast's devil spirit. However, it was an undeniable fact that it disappeared when he was around.</p>

  <p>Dennis was polite by asking this way. If it were not for Josh and the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace, he would have arrested the culprit already.</p>

  <p>Seeing the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace offering Luo Zheng a drop of Genuine Dragon blood essence, Dennis understood that he couldn't harm Luo Zheng. Moreover, Luo Zheng was somehow involved with Josh and the mystery of the nine dragons. So, he was eager to stay out of this matter.</p>

  <p>But it was troublesome to catch an Owl Beast's devil spirit. Luo Zheng had to compensate Dennis for his loss! Dennis knew that it would be useless to ask a cultivator, who was at the consummation of nature level for repayment. He said that intentionally to test the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace.</p>

  <p>As he had expected, Luo Zheng stayed silent, and it was the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace who spoke first, "It is only an Owl Beast's devil spirit. We, Dragon Abyss Palace, can pay for it. But Dennis, do you really want me to catch an Owl Beast's devil spirit for you?"</p>

  <p>It was no easy feat to catch an Owl Beast's devil spirit. It usually took a bit of luck to find one. Even if a cultivator found an Owl Beast's devil spirit, it would be extremely difficult to catch it.</p>

  <p>Since the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace offered to compensate Dennis, he didn't plan on making things difficult. If he offended the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace, she might take Luo Zheng by force. And then he could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>So he decided to end the matter for the moment.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Alan waved his hand and left with Zack. Since the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace had offered a drop of Genuine Dragon blood essence to Luo Zheng, Alan knew he had lost and that it was meaningless for him to stay. Even though the leader of the Dragon Blaze Hall had come in person and made the offer, he couldn't tempt Luo Zheng. Offering a Genuine Dragon blood essence to a boy at the consummation of nature level? It was a complete waste! The leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace must have been out of her mind.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Alan had left, the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace smiled.</p>

  <p>She turned to Luo Zheng and said, "Although you have a solid foundation, your cultivation base is still very low. This is the city that leads to the Lower World. There are a lot of training methods that will help you to improve.</p>

  <p>I suggest that you refine the Genuine Dragon blood essence here. And after that, you can come to the Dragon Abyss Palace through the transmission platform."</p>

  <p>It was a good suggestion. But Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "I'm afraid I won't be able to accept your offer this time. I came to the Upper World purely for cultivation. But I have unsettled issues in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>So, I can't go to the Dragon Abyss Palace at the moment."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that he would benefit tremendously from joining the Dragon Abyss Palace.</p>

  <p>In the world where Luo Zheng came from, cultivators who wanted to grasp the Law Power had to learn through the inscriptions on broken obelisks.</p>

  <p>But in the Upper World, there were complete stone carvings, and various cultivation methods that were beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>However, it was unrealistic for Luo Zheng to stay in the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>He still had a lot of things to do in the Central Region. Ever since he had embarked on the road of martial arts, Luo Zheng had only had one priority— to save his sister, Yan.</p>

  <p>Yan was at the Illuminating Soul Realm, and she had only to make one breakthrough to cross the big realm gap and reach the Internal Elixir Realm. It might be a great challenge for any other cultivators to achieve this. Even if they spent hundreds of years, they might not surpass the big realm gap, which was as difficult to cross as a nature chasm.</p>

  <p>But with Yan's great talent, and Eddie's methods, it was not as challenging as it seemed for Yan to enter the Internal Elixir Realm. There wasn't much time left for Luo Zheng! He had to hurry.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace nodded and said, "If you have unfinished things in the Lower World, your cultivator spirit won't be fully focused. This will certainly hinder your practice." Then, she took out a small amulet. "This amulet can save you in times of danger. I can't help you further. The success of martial arts depends on your efforts."</p>

  <p>What the leader said echoed the thoughts of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>If the young generation of a clan were offered too much help, it would do more harm than good as their will of martial arts wouldn't have much chance to be tempered. And it would be hard for them to make any achievement without strong determination.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He couldn't agree with her more. As the saying went, a gentleman should continually strive for self-perfection. The success obtained by relying on others was not success in a real sense. Only by improving oneself would a cultivator be able to win respect from others.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace had offered Luo Zheng an amulet, Dennis was surer that she had seen something in Luo Zheng. He assumed that she also had some knowledge about the mystery of the nine dragons. The only other explanation could be that she wanted to take a risk by betting on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although Dennis was the leader of the city, he didn't dare to get involved in this. After all, the higher the award, the greater the risk. This was a serious matter in the Genuine Dragon World. If the Dragon Abyss Palace thought they could take a share, Dennis couldn't stop them even though he envied them. He decided to act like he had not seen it.</p>

  <p>After the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace left, Elder Wei led Luo Zheng to a cultivation place. Luo Zheng had comprehended some laws and tempered his soul. Now, the next step was to improve his cultivation base. Although Luo Zheng had ascended the Dragon Soar Arena and his level had reached the consummation of nature level, his progress was still too slow.</p>

  <p>Before they went for the next practice place, Elder Wei gave Luo Zheng a set of equipment. It was the equipment that every common disciple of the Dragon Abyss Palace would get. To Zheng's astonishment, the basic set of equipment turned out to be a low-grade sacred sword, and a treasured body protection garment at the low-grade of sacred level.</p>

  <p>These sacred weapons were much sought-after in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>But here, they were equipment for common disciples. Luo Zheng was flustered.</p>

  <p>Things were so different in these two places.</p>

  <p>... .</p>

  <p>Time passed quickly in the Upper World. Zheng's cultivation base was improved rapidly in the secret cultivation places of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Within two months, Luo Zheng made a breakthrough in the consummation of nature level and entered the Illuminating Soul Realm. And with consecutive breakthroughs after that, Luo Zheng successfully entered the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"It's time to return..."</p>

  <p>Standing at the gate of the city, Luo Zheng looked at the hundreds of thousands of teleporters that spread endlessly in the sky. At the same time, Zheng's life vitality began to burn. His body soared to the sky like that of a flying bird. Finally, he jumped into the teleporter that had brought him here.</p>

  <p>Once in the teleporter, a gentle light was cast on Luo Zheng. With the light shining on him, Zheng's blood and flesh disintegrated into small particles.</p>

  <p>As the light above the teleporter became brighter, the numerous particles rushed into the sky with the light.</p>

  <p>Oracle City, known as the capital of tens of thousands of merchants, was the most prosperous commercial center in the Central Region. In the city, as long a person had money, he could get everything he wanted.</p>

  <p>Oracle City was able to prosper largely because of the World Commercial Alliance. The headquarters of the World Commercial Alliance was situated here.</p>

  <p>The news that the Dragon Soar Arena had been moved to the Oracle City got around fast.</p>

  <p>And the Martial Arts Contest also provoked much discussion among the people in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The Martial Arts Contest that was held every ten years in Oracle City was the focus of all the cultivators in the Central Region as it would decide the future of all the sects.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Ethereal Spirit Sect and the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit had shown extraordinary talent in the Martial Arts Contest decades ago. As long as a cultivator got a top ranking in the contest, he could have a place of his own in the Central Region in the future.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Martial Arts Contest would take place ahead of schedule. It was all because of the Dragon Soar Arena. Everyone knew that the Martial Arts Contest held this year would be fiercer than ever, and of course, more splendid.</p>

  <p>So after the news was released three months ago, many cultivators from different places gathered in Oracle City. For this reason, the inns and taverns were all jam-packed. And the prices rose accordingly. The cost for an inn room for one night, which was usually several low-grade life vitality crystals had now soared to tens of low-grade life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>In an instant, cries of discontent rose all around. But the people could do nothing about it. If they wanted to have fun, they had to pay.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Soar Arena was placed in the center of Oracle City, with fences and armed guards surrounding it. Meanwhile, Cloud Hall, Bloodwood Cliff, Black Mountain Sect, and Ethereal Spirit Sect all sent people to guard it.</p>

  <p>In fact, the elders of the sects had gathered here a couple of days earlier.</p>

  <p>Aside from them, people from the World Commercial Alliance also took command here. No one dared to put their hands on the Dragon Soar Arena. If someone tried to take it, he would be courting death. The several big sects sent people to guard the Dragon Soar Arena to declare that they also had a share in it. It was a way to showcase their powers and intimidate others.</p>

  <p>Today, the weather was good. After summer began, a rain cooled the hot weather that had lasted for days.</p>

  <p>A large number of cultivators stood around the Dragon Soar Arena. They were watching it and discussing it. These cultivators were not qualified to participate in the contest, but they heard that the Dragon Soar Arena was the most valuable reward for the winner. It was enough to tempt people to come to look at it.</p>

  <p>"It is said that anyone who enters the Dragon Soar Arena could fly into the Upper World! And he will become an immortal or a god. What a treasure! Everyone must covet it!"</p>

  <p>"No wonder so many big sects are fighting for it. I will spare no efforts to get into the sect that wins the Dragon Soar Arena!"</p>

  <p>"Huh! The sects competing in the contest are at the fourth grade or above. Forget about the Dragon Soar Arena. Do you think you have the ability to enter one of them now?"</p>

  <p>As the several cultivators discussed the contest with interest, a bright light suddenly appeared in the sky. The light seemed to be like a meteor that was falling from the sky rapidly. It shot to the top of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>
