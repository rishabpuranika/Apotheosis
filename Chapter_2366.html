<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In just a dozen days, Nelly had changed a lot, much to Zheng's surprise.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng agreed with Rachelle. It was not that easy to dissolve the grudge between the Mu Clan and the Luo Clan. What Nelly thought was too naive.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng heard a series of noises coming from afar.</p>

  <p>When he raised his head, he saw a light curtain flash in front of the Heavenly Wheel Temple. On the surface of the light curtain, pitch-black spears appeared, carrying within them a strange force that almost made them seem as if they had been formed by time itself.</p>

  <p>"Black spears!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows rose slightly. He instantly remembered the words of the consummate True God of the Sword Clan, "Be careful with the black spears." It seemed that he had been killed by these black spears when he had visited the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>But what power was hidden in these spears that had made him look like he had died for countless years in a short period of time?</p>

  <p>With their abilities, there was no way the consummate True Gods would be wasting time on infiltrating the Roc race and the Swallow race if they could directly enter the Heavenly Wheel Temple on their own. Zheng guessed that they must have tried to do that once and suffered a great setback, so they had no choice but to ally with other races now.</p>

  <p>'Was Troy also killed by these black spears?' Zheng wondered, but soon, he concluded that it wasn't a possibility. After all, Rachelle had just mentioned that Troy would give Shahn and Walton trouble.</p>

  <p>However, he hadn't come with them today, which meant that he must have been hurt by these spears. Zheng looked at the snake, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>When the Heavenly Wheel Snake arrived in front of the light, it suddenly thrust out its long and thin tongue with a hissing sound. Slowly, a crack ran up the middle of the light curtain enveloping the Heavenly Wheel Temple, splitting the curtain into two.</p>

  <p>The moment the light curtain was opened, many consummate True Gods raised their heads with a faint murderous look in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>The moment they unleashed the killing intent, the Heavenly Wheel Snake paused, and its huge body instantly retreated back within the light curtain. At the same time, it raised its head high, vigilantly glancing around.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Shahn gently waved his hand, indicating everyone to calm down.</p>

  <p>Although these consummate True Gods couldn't use their Godly Ways, they had no doubt that they could take the Heavenly Wheel Snake down.</p>

  <p>What they couldn't break was the light curtain that enveloped the Heavenly Wheel Temple and the black spears. When they saw the light curtain open a crack, they couldn't help but feel a killing intent in their hearts.</p>

  <p>However, they hadn't expected the snake to be so alert. They lowered their heads once again so as not to scare it away.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Snake looked around with a tentative hiss. A long time passed before it finally dispelled its doubts and crept out of the light curtain toward the altar.</p>

  <p>The length of the Heavenly Wheel Snake was unknown. It had slithered all the way from the Heavenly Wheel Temple to the altar, but the crowd still couldn't see its entire body, most of which was still hidden within the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>After it slithered onto the altar, the Heavenly Wheel Snake stuck out its tongue at the Eagle race, the Roc race, and the Swallow race below.</p>

  <p>The chiefs of the three races understood what it wanted. They climbed up the altar and set the frightened children there. Then, they went back down and prostrated themselves on the ground again.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>"I'm scared!"</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>A few of the children screamed and cried bitterly when they saw the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>However, most of them were too dumbfounded to even cry.</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>Lust could be seen in the Heavenly Wheel Snake's black eyes. Its tongue protruded out of its mouth, and it swept toward the children like a rope.</p>

  <p>In general, a creature was the most focused at the moment of attacking or feeding, and the Heavenly Wheel Snake was no exception.</p>

  <p>If the group waited for the snake to swallow the children before they made their move, it would be too late.</p>

  <p>Zheng understood this point, and so did the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Rachelle, who had been lowering her head, suddenly shouted, "Go!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, she turned into a blood light and rushed toward the Heavenly Wheel Snake. As she jumped to her feet with her hands spread out, the sword and the machete in her hands were like her wings, drawing two beautiful curves in the air.</p>

  <p>All the consummate True Gods present, including Shahn and Walton, followed suit.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Zheng followed closely behind. The force under his feet surged violently, creating a huge sandpit.</p>

  <p>The members of the Swallow race, the Eagle race, and the Roc race all stood up with complex and excited expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>They had been oppressed by the Heavenly Wheel Snake for many years.</p>

  <p>Every one to six months, they had to sacrifice a few children to satisfy its appetite, so they hated the snake to the core.</p>

  <p>However, their fear of the snake had lasted for generations, and they had no power or ability to resist it at all.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, these outsiders who had suddenly appeared had power that was way beyond their understanding. If these outsiders could really kill the Heavenly Wheel Snake, it would be a good thing for them.</p>

  <p>Among all the consummate True Gods, Rachelle was the most efficient.</p>

  <p>All everyone could see was a blood-red light flashing across the sky and falling on the head of the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>Cling!</p>

  <p>The short sword in her hand was like a nail that stabbed into the head of the snake, and Rachelle fixed herself there.</p>

  <p>Hiss... Hiss...</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Snake raised its head high as it writhed in pain. Its tongue, which had wrapped around the children and pulled them up into the air, suddenly loosened its hold, causing the children to fall.</p>

  <p>"Catch them!"</p>

  <p>"Catch our children!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Swallow race, the Eagle race, and the Roc race began panicking when they saw this scene. Although they were in a desert and the surface was soft, their children would still suffer serious injuries after falling from such a high altitude.</p>

  <p>"Yo! Yo!"</p>

  <p>Luckily, the mysterious birds, golden rocs and eagles reacted quickly and shot high into the sky to catch the children.</p>

  <p>Finally feeling relieved, the three chiefs turned around and looked at the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>When they saw what was happening, their jaws dropped open.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Snake, which they had always considered invincible, was constantly writhing around in an attempt to get rid of the outsiders. However, the outsiders were extremely agile and were continuously attacking it from all sides.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Rachelle slid down the snake's head, violently dragging her saber behind her and creating a two-hundred feet wound on the snake's head. Dark red blood spilled out continuously from the snake's head, like a waterfall. When Rachelle smelled the blood, her eyes lit up in excitement. As soon as her toes touched the ground, she leaped up again.</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled on the large snake's wide neck, slashing around with his Great Weighty Sword and tearing the snake's skin to shreds.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods also unleashed their own theurgies to seriously injure the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>Killing this snake would have been a piece of cake for any one of them if they could use their Godly Ways. But now, since they had to use their own strength, they all had to work together.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Heavenly Wheel Snake raised its head high and smashed it onto the altar.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As the snake's body vibrated violently, many consummate True Gods standing on top of the snake fell down.</p>

  <p>Only Zheng, Rachelle, and Shahn, who had been sharp enough to stab their weapons into the snake's head and tightly fix themselves on it at this critical moment, remained on top of the snake.</p>

  <p>Then, in one swift moment, the snake retreated into the Heavenly Wheel Temple, dragging Zheng, Rachelle, and Shahn along with it.</p>

  <p>As soon as the snake disappeared from sight, the crack in the light curtain began to slowly close.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>"Charge in before the light curtain closes!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods passed through the light curtain and rushed into the temple one after another.</p>

  <p>There was a great gap between Nelly's ability and that of the consummate True Gods. Therefore, she didn't rush forward immediately.</p>

  <p>Looking at the light curtain that was slowly closing, she pulled out the bamboo flute in her hand and summoned the Royal Eagle of the Eagle race.</p>

  <p>A chief of the Eagle race tried to stop her when he saw this scene. But on second thought, he decided that they had no choice but to help the outsiders, now that they had already offended the Heavenly Wheel Snake. He just hoped that these outsiders would really kill the snake.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, everyone would feel its wrath.</p>

  <p>The moment the Royal Eagle reached Nelly, she turned over and jumped onto its back. With her eyes on the crack in the light curtain, she grabbed the feather on the Royal Eagle's back with one hand.</p>

  <p>By now, the crack had shrunk small enough for only one person to pass through it. Without wasting a single second, Nelly exerted all her strength and thrust herself up with the Royal Eagle. Miraculously, she managed to enter the crack. As soon as she entered, the crack in the light curtain was completely closed.</p>
