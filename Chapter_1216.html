  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm warriors of the four divine kingdoms understood that they could only let themselves be slaughtered since they lacked the ability to fight back.</p>

  <p>Once the Celestial Position members subdued the Evil Dragon, they would most likely kill them all. The members didn't need to kill them but there was really no merit with letting them go.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "The weak will stand as easy prey to the strong."</p>

  <p>They were mere ants in the eyes of these Spirit Supreme Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Each warrior that stood frozen against their will had differing views on their situation.</p>

  <p>Quite a few found themselves unable to accept the reality, and one of them was War Emperor York. At first, he had been unlucky and had been used as a bait to lure the Evil Dragon. However, his fate reversed when the Evil Dragon did not swallow him up and he was able to come back alive.</p>

  <p>Now with a second chance at life, War Emperor York was currently racking his brains trying to think of a way to escape from his current predicament.</p>

  <p>A few others, however, were not as afraid of death. War King Wind, for instance, did not mind dying that moment though he did feel extremely guilty for bringing Fiona and Callan with him. A parent would never wish death upon his children after all.</p>

  <p>Fiona, on the other hand, was indifferent to her own fate, too busy worrying if Luo Luo Zheng had managed to escape.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon let out another horrifying bellow, twisting its long and narrow body as it tried to drill itself back into the large crater.</p>

  <p>"Don't let it get in! Stop it!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>Max, the one who wore a silver mask, held up a bent walking stick in his hand and blocked the top of the crater ahead of others.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon seemed to be wary of Max and immediately fired its burning breath towards him.</p>

  <p>The sight of devastating flames would've made anyone panic, but nobody could tell with Max because of his mask. He looked calm though, as he lightly held out his walking stick and summoned an irregular crystal shield out of nowhere, protecting him from the dragon's attack.</p>

  <p>Noticing that its attack did nothing to its opponent, the Evil Dragon opened its mouth fully, intending to swallow Max whole.</p>

  <p>A fully grown dragon would be big enough to wrap itself around an entire continent, but this Evil Dragon was only at its infancy, so it was significantly smaller. However, it was still gigantic compared to Max.</p>

  <p>So when it opened its mouth, it could be compared to an eagle trying to swallow a mosquito. It would've been a funny sight if not for the context of the situation.</p>

  <p>Of course, Max wasn't going to let himself be eaten so easily. He quickly waved his walking stick and traced a circle in the air. "Spin around and go down," he muttered.</p>

  <p>The moment the Evil Dragon touched the circle, its entire body suddenly flipped itself.</p>

  <p>It was as if an invisible giant in the sky reached out and grabbed the beast, then threw it heavily to the other side.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon's body smashed onto the ground and caused a heavy tremor through the earth.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdom warriors all fell to the ground from the shaking.</p>

  <p>Rocks had also been dislodged and were now on their way to smash them.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the corpses they occupied all had high cultivation levels that were able to smash the rocks that headed their way. These corpses served as shields that protected the souls within.</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon was also fine. Though it had been smashed down by a heavy force, it did not sustain too much damage. Now that it realized that it could no longer return to its own nest, it immediately lay down on the ground with a huff and surrounded itself with a cloud of dust.</p>

  <p>"Crap! Stop it! It wants to seal itself!" Max shouted, rushing towards the beast.</p>

  <p>The burly man, armed with a giant sickle in hand, rushed towards the Evil Dragon along with the others.</p>

  <p>However, as the man neared the dust cloud, a miraculous scene appeared.</p>

  <p>One would think that even an ordinary person without any cultivation would be able to rush towards a dust cloud with no problem.</p>

  <p>However, the burly man found himself unable to charge into the cloud, the dust acting as a natural barrier to keep intruders from venturing inside.</p>

  <p>"Break it!"</p>

  <p>The burly man immediately raised his giant sickle.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>He slashed through the air, but there was only a small spark. It had been unable to cut through the flying dust.</p>

  <p>His failure upset him greatly as he pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>And it wasn't just him. The others were also unable to break through the dust barrier. Max slowly floated over towards them and said, "This is troublesome. The Evil Dragon has really sealed itself. The method of sealing is an instinct of any super legendary beast."</p>

  <p>"How long will it last?" one of the members asked.</p>

  <p>"It won't be short, but it won't also be terribly long. It's extremely troublesome. Also, while it is sealed, it will undergo its fourth evolution.</p>

  <p>When that happens, we're all doomed."</p>

  <p>The Evil Dragon's third evolution already required several Spirit Supreme Realm warriors. A fourth evolution would do wonders for its power. By then, only the executives of the Celestial Position race could probably deal with it.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" the burly man asked. He had been able to injure the Evil Dragon after activating his blood's berserk power? with great difficulty. None of them ever expected that the dragon would seal itself and that they'd be able to do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>Max only shook his head, his mask hiding his emotions. Since he was their leader, they would have no choice but to follow his orders.</p>

  <p>At that moment, three figures flew over from the horizon. Max looked up and tutted. "Let's not bother about this. It seems like the situation with Dorothea will be more troublesome."</p>

  <p>"More troublesome?" The burly man also raised his head to look and his bell-like eyes widened in surprise. "Damn! That woman took out the Ancestral Dragon's egg? And it's hatched? How can the Ancestral Dragon be in her hands?"</p>

  <p>That "woman" the burly man was referring to was actually Luo Luo Zheng within Brianna's body.</p>

  <p>The scholarly man frowned. "What's going on with Dorothea? Why would she let that woman take the Ancestral Dragon?"</p>

  <p>Max sighed, "Even though I've had my luck boosted, it seems there's someone out there with a luck stronger than mine."</p>

  <p>He said those words bitterly.</p>

  <p>As a core member of the Celestial Position race, Max had once obtained a silver-colored title in the Tower of Illusory.</p>

  <p>After living for so long and undergoing a myriad of experiences, he had come to believe very much in destiny.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when he saw Luo Luo Zheng with the Ancestral Dragon, he did not get angry but simply uttered a bitter sigh.</p>

  <p>"Dorothea, what's going on? How could you let her take the Ancestral Dragon?" the burly man cried out, staring at Luo Luo Zheng with a deep frown. It was defeat after defeat. The Evil Dragon had sealed itself which meant all their efforts had been in vain. And now, the Ancestral Dragon egg had been taken and actually hatched by a country bumpkin who had escaped from them.</p>

  <p>Dorothea's eyes flashed. She was too lazy to answer the burly man the moment she landed.</p>

  <p>"Dorothea, what's going on?" Max asked. "Is it because the Ancestral Dragon hatched when she rushed into the spire?"</p>

  <p>Dorothea nodded, "Sort of."</p>

  <p>"But how did she break my enchanted barrier?" the scholarly man asked.</p>

  <p>He couldn't imagine just what kind of method Luo Luo Zheng had devised to break the enchanted barrier he had set up so meticulously.</p>

  <p>Dorothea smiled lightly. "She has a supreme divine weapon in her possession? the Black Star. No matter how strong your enchanted barrier is, Delroy, it could never hope to stand against it. The Law of Causality contained in the Black Star is much stronger than yours!"</p>
