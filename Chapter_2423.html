<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flashed a satisfied smile when he saw the light appear from the top of the wall.</p>

  <p>'It turns out that this is how the Sword Clan saves people, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>It made sense. The Sword Clan wouldn't send people to save the fighters in the Killing Zone. If too many top-rank True Gods were in danger, the Sword Clan wouldn't be able to save all of them.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the Sword Clan had devised a simple method to save them.</p>

  <p>They directly pierced the wall above the head of the contender who was in danger and released the aura from the Non-combat Zone. Once the aura had surrounded the injured True God, those beetles wouldn't be able to attack again.</p>

  <p>There was a loud noise when the top of the cave was broken through. Then a member of the Sword Clan jumped down from above and seized the top-rank True God before leaving in the same fashion.</p>

  <p>That True God had been lucky, but not all of them could be saved.</p>

  <p>Just as Bill said, there was a risk of dying in the Killing Zone.</p>

  <p>A black beetle popped out from his side when a top-rank True God flew in the air. Then, the beetle's sharp horn pierced through his head and nailed him to the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>The man fell silently on the ground despite the pain. Of course, he also didn't have a chance to break the Sword Card before he was killed.</p>

  <p>All of the True Gods who saw the scene felt a chill run down their spine.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they were left with no other choice but to move even faster and outrun the beetles as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>"These beetles are really troublesome," Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Just then, his gaze froze slightly as he ran forward.</p>

  <p>According to the information he got, he would be able to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao after he passed the second round of screening.</p>

  <p>If everything went according to what Hallet had said, Harold would definitely be present in the debate venue with Yan!</p>

  <p>He actually wasn't interested in the debate over the Divine Dao, but he had to go through this round of screening because he wanted to see Yan.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Once again, he turned into a beam of light and sped away.</p>

  <p>Buzz?</p>

  <p>When he had run over ten miles, he heard a humming sound above his head.</p>

  <p>A breeze flew over his head when he sharply turned around almost on reflex.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>More than ten black light beams suddenly flew towards him!</p>

  <p>Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock!</p>

  <p>At the same time, there were several knocking sounds as the beetles' sharp horns were nailed to the cave wall.</p>

  <p>Those black beetles had hit the wall instead of Luo Zheng, but they dislodged themselves from the wall and chased him again!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As soon as he caught sight of the beetles getting even closer, he turned over.</p>

  <p>The power within his body surged out and unleashed flashes of fist radiance.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Yet even if he had used nearly fifty percent of his strength source, he still failed to kill the black beetles!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the tremendous force still shook all of the beetles quite violently.</p>

  <p>With the help of the reactive force from his attack, he quickly ran away and his body performed a series of movements fluidly like it was water. At that point, the black beetles could do nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, his liquid-like movements caught the attention of several top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, something else had happened outside the Killing Zone.</p>

  <p>Under the quiet sky was a long and thin branch that stretched out from the top of the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>The branch bent continuously like a bamboo reed, until it was coiled into a pure, natural platform.</p>

  <p>There on the platform stood Bill, who was looking down.</p>

  <p>The Killing Zone was a long and narrow path that was specially opened up for the members of the Sword Clan to cultivate, which extended hundreds of miles within the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>The members of the Sword Clan also stood on the platform where Bill was and observed the entire expanse of the Killing Zone using their clan's method.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there were over ten thousand Sword Clan members scattered on the surface of the Sunrest Tree below the platform on standby.</p>

  <p>If anyone broke the Sword Card and sent out a signal for help, the Sword Clan members would cut through the surface of the tree as fast as they could and save the True Gods inside it.</p>

  <p>Bill's gaze had been focused on Luo Zheng and Luo Zheng only.</p>

  <p>To be honest, he thought that it was such an experience to watch a low-rank True God progress in the Killing Zone.</p>

  <p>The Killing Zone where Luo Zheng was wasn't the only one of its kind, though.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had created over a hundred similar Killing Zones within the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>Some of them, however, were empty and were not considered as dangerous.</p>

  <p>Those Killing Zones were used by Sword Clan members who wanted to comprehend the other side of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Some Killing Zones were very dangerous.</p>

  <p>Within the enormous tree trunk lived some of the most extraordinary monsters one could ever see.</p>

  <p>Although the Sword Clan had occupied the Sunrest Tree for so many years, the truth was that their understanding of the Sunrest Tree was not as clear as the outsiders thought they were.</p>

  <p>There were still some mysterious beasts that lived in the body of the Sunrest Tree to date, and there were some highly dangerous Killing Zones that not even consummate True Gods would dare to enter.</p>

  <p>The Killing Zone that was used for screening was usually used for the cultivation of the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>It was chosen for that purpose because it was close to the surface of the Sunrest Tree. If the participants were in danger, they just had to move fast enough to break their Sword Cards to be rescued.</p>

  <p>But the low-rank and mid-rank True Gods considered it a hazardous place.</p>

  <p>"No wonder he can stir up trouble in the Floating Islands. He is so powerful that I'm afraid the best disciple of our Sword Clan is far inferior to him!"</p>

  <p>Bill exclaimed. If he had doubted the rumors before, now he understood that there was nothing exaggerated about Luo Zheng's performance in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Just then, two greyish-white figures appeared from a nearby distance. They suddenly appeared in front of Bill in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>It turned out that those two figures were also consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>One of them was a middle-aged man in his forties with a thick but neat moustache, and he looked rather amicable. He was Clifford Sword, one of the elders of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>The other one was an old man with a sinister appearance and an indifferent expression. He was also one of the elders of the Sword Clan, and his name was Ivan Sword.</p>

  <p>"Has the second round of screening begun?" Clifford Sword asked with a smile as he stepped on the round platform. Ivan Sword, however, did not feel the same cheeriness.</p>

  <p>"Humph! It's stupid to place hope on these warriors!" he said coldly. "This is just the first group of True Gods participating in the second round of screening.</p>

  <p>This time, the number of True Gods who will join the second round will be several times more than those of the previous ones. I believe that there will be more elites who will pass the screening test," Bill said happily.</p>

  <p>"It won't change even if the number of elites is a hundred times larger. The elites from a group of trash are still trash," Ivan Sword spat out.</p>

  <p>Even if he was ill-tempered, Bill seemed to be familiar with his attitude and did not look bothered at all.</p>

  <p>"Is there any warrior with better performance within the first group of ten thousand True Gods?" Ivan Sword still asked despite his disdain.</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head as if he was in frustration. "No. None of them performed well."</p>

  <p>"I knew it! They are all garbage!" Ivan Sword sniggered.</p>

  <p>Bill's lips curved up into a playful smile. "But I've found an interesting little fellow among them!" he announced.</p>

  <p>It was known that only a handful of people were able to attract Bill's interest.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Clifford Sword and Ivan Sword immediately perked up and asked almost simultaneously, "Who is that?"</p>
