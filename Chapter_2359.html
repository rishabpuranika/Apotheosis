<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The chief that the executioner was referring to was the supreme commander of the Eagle Castle.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Zheng said with a nod.</p>

  <p>With that, the executioner left in a hurry, leaving all the members of the Eagle race awaiting punishment to look at Zheng in surprise.</p>

  <p>"You… You can really do it?"</p>

  <p>"You can heal the broken wing of our Royal Eagle?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>In their excitement, the voices of the members of Eagle race trembled.</p>

  <p>They were all too willing to take on the punishment.</p>

  <p>It was an unforgivable sin to let the Royal Eagle get hurt— it was worse than losing even their own lives.</p>

  <p>So when they heard Zheng make such a sudden promise, naturally, they got riled up. Still, they were worried he was just lying.</p>

  <p>Aoo…</p>

  <p>After a moment, an eagle was heard singing.</p>

  <p>Some sort of black light appeared in the sky where the eagle spread its wings and circled the area, flying towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment the black light appeared, all the eagles in the Eagle Castle grew extremely quiet. They scattered into every corner, curling up their wings and sticking out their chests, motionless, like soldiers under inspection.</p>

  <p>"This eagle is huge!" Zheng muttered while looking up at it.</p>

  <p>The feathers on the eagle's neck turned out to be a light golden color, and the eagle's powerful momentum left Zheng feeling threatened— it was a truly powerful Royal Eagle. It had the power to fight him.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Royal Eagle landed opposite to Zheng as a sturdy member of the Eagle race leapt off its back.</p>

  <p>It shed a strange cloak, revealing a middle-aged man with a wide forehead— the chief of the Eagle Castle.</p>

  <p>Turning to face Zheng, the chief asked in the Eagle race's language, "Can you heal our Royal Eagle's broken wing?"</p>

  <p>Unlike the other members of the Eagle race, the chief didn't doubt Zheng's words. If he was lying, he would soon be exposed, after all.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can," Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, the chief's Royal Eagle made a sound— it should have understood Zheng's words and stared right at him with sharp eyes.</p>

  <p>Also looking intently at Zheng was the chief as he asked, "Do you have any requests other than letting these people go?"</p>

  <p>He figured it was natural to forgive those people if the Royal Eagle could be healed. They had nothing to do with Zheng, after all. So this didn't count as a request at all.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," Zheng said with a smile. "Let go of the woman you have caught."</p>

  <p>A sense of hesitation came over the chief at Zheng's request. "She killed our eagles. She is our enemy."</p>

  <p>"I can promise you that she will not be making a move again," Zheng affirmed.</p>

  <p>The chief nodded as he thought it over.</p>

  <p>Even if the woman was released and asked for another fight, she was no match for them.</p>

  <p>Under the chief's leadership, Zheng arrived at the rear tower of the Eagle Castle.</p>

  <p>He pushed the door open to find the Royal Eagle lying on the floor with its broken wing. Its wound was tightly wrapped, but it was clear that it had already lost any hope for flying ever again. There was despair in its eyes.</p>

  <p>"Please." The chief made a gesture.</p>

  <p>With a nod and a light pat, Zheng conjured a round milk-white pill that emitted a soft fragrance.</p>

  <p>The sweet smell attracted both the Royal Eagle and the chief.</p>

  <p>It was merely a five times refined pill, something Zheng had obtained when he was still on the Floating Island of the Han Clan. It was a magical pill that could help any True God recover from broken limbs.</p>

  <p>As Zheng walked towards the eagle, it grew vigilant. Refusing to take the pill, it seemed ready to attack.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to the chief helplessly.</p>

  <p>Then, the chief pulled out a flute and began playing it— the members of the Eagle race could communicate with their eagles as such.</p>

  <p>With the melodious sound in the air, the Royal Eagle grew calmer, or at least, it opened its mouth more tamely.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his hand, Zheng got the pill flowing down the Royal Eagle's throat.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng retreated to the side with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Aoo! Aoo!" The Royal Eagle behind the chief with light golden feathers around its neck made a few sounds. There was a trace of nervousness in its eyes.</p>

  <p>Even the chief seemed nervous as he looked at the Royal Eagle. "How long will it take for the pill to take effect?" he asked. Even with the pill's magical effect, the chief figured that it was impossible for the Royal Eagle's wing to be healed in a matter of minutes— that was too good to be true.</p>

  <p>"In just a few moments," Zheng answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>Even a True God could gain a new limb after taking the pill, though they needed to train the new limb that was far from its original.</p>

  <p>But regaining a limb was nothing short of a miracle in this world.</p>

  <p>It was barely a minute when the Royal Eagle's body shook violently, rustling its black feathers. After a moment, a wisp of blood gushed out of the well-wrapped wound as some pale green energy gathered around its broken wing.</p>

  <p>Bones, muscles, and blood began gathering and growing at a visible speed.</p>

  <p>"What? So fast! This is indeed a miracle!" the chief exclaimed, his eyes widening in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Aoo! Aoo! Aoo!" The Royal Eagle howled in excitement behind the chief.</p>

  <p>Soon, a brand new wing grew along with pitch-black feathers.</p>

  <p>"Aoo! Aoo!"</p>

  <p>The eagle flapped its wings, setting off a burst of violent wind that circled out of the window, and rushed into the sky.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much..."</p>

  <p>The chief was excitedly exclaiming in gratitude and put his right hand over his left chest, bowing before Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Royal Eagles had an unlimited potential of growth— to lose one was great damage to the Eagle race. After all, only one out of thousands could become a Royal Eagle.</p>

  <p>When it flew out of the tower, the Royal Eagle drew cheers from the members of the Eagle race outside. They had never seen such a miracle in their lives— it was shocking but certainly delightful.</p>

  <p>When the exclamations reached her ears, Nelly looked up at the Royal Eagle in the sky with an aggrieved expression on her face.</p>

  <p>Ever since she saw Zheng a few days ago, he never appeared again. Had he already left the castle?</p>

  <p>"How heartless he is! He refuses to help me even though I am in the face of death!" she bit her lip with hatred. "Even though the Mu Clan and the Luo Clan are enemies, I've never treated you as one."</p>

  <p>She didn't know how long she would be locked up by these people— she was probably there to be executed one day by those damned eagles.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, sadness rushed over her, so much so that she could feel her eyes getting glassy. She didn't want to die in the damned place for no reason.</p>

  <p>But just then, a figure quietly appeared.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Nelly sensed something. When she raised her head, there Zheng was, looking at her with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>But in her eyes, she could sense a touch of mockery in his smile.</p>

  <p>"Why are you still here?" Nelly's face darkened.</p>

  <p>But Zheng merely waved his hand and said something to the people behind him. Two men came over and opened up the cage.</p>

  <p>Still cautious, Nelly didn't leave the cage immediately. Instead, she suddenly stood up and took two steps back, her expression growing vigilant. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I'm letting you go," Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Letting me go?" She couldn't believe it.</p>

  <p>Shrugging his shoulders, Zheng turned around and left without a word.</p>

  <p>Standing in the cage, Nelly was still in a daze, wondering how on earth Zheng made these people let her go so easily.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's back disappeared at the corner, Nelly rushed out of the cage to run after him.</p>

  <p>The members of the Eagle race held a grand feast to show their gratitude.</p>

  <p>Nelly took a seat beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thinking about how she became a distinguished guest from nothing but a prisoner in the cage, she got rather emotional. Seeing how the Eagle race respected Zheng so much, she was puzzled. It seemed that the guy had even learned the Eagle race's language in a short time.</p>

  <p>Zheng could communicate well with them, but Nelly was left stunned at the banquet like she had gone deaf.</p>

  <p>Everyone clinked their glasses and toasted to the chief. It wasn't until then that Zheng learned basic information about their world.</p>

  <p>His very purpose in helping the Eagle race was to get to the truth of the world as soon as he could. From the looks of it, it was very likely that the world was built by the jade seal, meaning that there must be a key point in controlling it.</p>

  <p>Apart from Zheng himself, the consummate True Gods had also entered the world.</p>

  <p>Although the consummate True God of the Sword Clan died in the desert rather strangely, other consummate True Gods were unlikely to die so easily.</p>

  <p>Those consummate True Gods would definitely pour their efforts into finding a way, so he had to rush things along.</p>
