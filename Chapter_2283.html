<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pearl's eyes were like two pools of anger as she stood perfectly still.</p>

  <p>She was only a mere lobbyist in her clan.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the powerful clans on the Floating Islands were ranked like a pyramid. The top three clans were far more powerful than the ordinary clans and were the ones that were completely in control.</p>

  <p>In addition, only those three powerful clans were qualified to demand warriors from other ordinary clans, and the latter couldn't refuse.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that they could dominate and oppress those clans if they wanted.</p>

  <p>Back then, it was the Qian Clan that had been oppressed. They had offended the Dongfang Clan, but they did not have a direct conflict.</p>

  <p>However, the Dongfang Clan allied with several other clans to crush the Qian Clan in the Arena of Legends. Therefore, the Qian Clan's rank dropped sharply from their original thirteenth place, and soon fell out of the whole rankings. According to the rules, they had no choice but to evacuate the Time Sea and watch their Floating Island sink into the waters.</p>

  <p>That said a lot about the dominant role of the top three clans in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>After Pearl had spent quite a while by the gate of Zheng's room, she turned around and left. Just as she was about to leave the Hall of True Gods for her room, a voice said, "He shouldn't be a direct disciple of the Han Clan. The warriors of humble origin are always very disobedient."</p>

  <p>Pearl turned and looked coldly at a grinning Nelly. In turn, she stepped back a little in fear that she might take her anger out on her. "You're right. He is from the Han Clan, but they did not train him. It's useless to threaten an arrogant guy like him," she responded.</p>

  <p>Then, she turned to Liusu and said, "Ask your elders to give me the anonymous man."</p>

  <p>In reality, Liusu was already annoyed at the fact that Pearl looked down upon her clan, so she replied coldly, "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because of the reputation of my clan," said Pearl.</p>

  <p>"But we don't necessarily have the anonymous man," Liusu stressed.</p>

  <p>She thought about the strong influence of the Dongfang Clan on the Time Sea, so she said what she had said for her clan to be considered.</p>

  <p>However, Pearl shook her head and said, "I think Joy knows very well whether he belongs to your clan or not.</p>

  <p>Forget it, it's useless to talk to you. I will just go to your clan and personally ask for him some other time."</p>

  <p>When she was done, she gently pushed open the door to her room and disappeared in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>The top disciples of the powerful clans in the Hall of True Gods bowed their heads down and filled the area with whispers. None of them had thought that the Han Clan would offend the Dongfang Clan because of the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>They strongly believed that the anonymous man came from the Han Clan because of the Gods Killing Sword Array that he had used. However, that was not certain yet, and the Han Clan might not even know about it.</p>

  <p>After a few more discussions, they soon returned to their rooms.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had randomly challenged Quentin, he might choose to challenge someone else again. No one wanted to miss such an opportunity.</p>

  <p>In the Spiritual Heart Hall, Liusu left the Jade Wall of Legends as well. She freshened herself up, and then quietly made her way further into the hall.</p>

  <p>Next, she walked on an eerily quiet road.</p>

  <p>At the end of the road was a transmission platform, and under it were six armed guards who stood perfectly still. When they saw a figure approach them, one of them took a few steps forward and shouted, "This is the forbidden land of the Han Clan. No one is allowed to intrude!"</p>

  <p>Yet Liusu continued to walk and when she was close enough, the guard recognized her. "Your Highness!"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the guards followed suit and bowed in respect.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, the Holy Emperor refuses to receive guests lately. If you don't have anything important..." the guard said in a low voice. Those guards watched over the palace of the Holy Emperor, which was located in the inner part of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>A transmission array was needed to enter it. Joy had tried to trespass it last time, but the guards were responsible and loyal to the emperor. They had suffered a lot from the fight with Joy.</p>

  <p>"I have to see my father. It's something important," Liusu stated in her usual flat voice.</p>

  <p>"But..." the guard protested. On the other hand, Liusu didn't bother to argue with him and walked straight to the transmission platform.</p>

  <p>The guards might be loyal to the emperor, but they didn't dare to stop her.</p>

  <p>She walked around the transmission platform, and then a faint blue light flashed through it. Her figure sank into it and disappeared in front of the guards.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Liusu was finally inside the inner part of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>A gentle breeze carded through her hair as she was greeted with the sight of a huge palace.</p>

  <p>Ever since she came back from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, she rarely saw her father. Even if she did, her father had been much more unenthusiastic, and she did not know why.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the palace was an empty hall, where a middle-aged man in luxurious clothes sat upright, as if he was in meditation. He was Samuel, the Holy Being of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"Father." Liusu's voice cut through the silence.</p>

  <p>She entered the palace and curtsied to her father.</p>

  <p>The said man opened his eyes and asked, "Liusu? What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you what happened in the Arena of Legends," she said.</p>

  <p>"You are not supposed to meddle in these things," he said with a small smile.</p>

  <p>"I know, but what I say may affect the ranking of our Floating Island," answered Liusu earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead then." "Father, did you know that a proving godly warrior who can compete above his level has recently shown up in the Arena of Legends?" To this, Samuel nodded.</p>

  <p>While the Holy Beings indeed didn't pay much attention to the Arena of Legends, they would ask about it when the Floating Islands were ranked.</p>

  <p>After all, the ranking was very important for all powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The points that the anonymous man had obtained were enough to change the ranks of the powerful clans, so someone had already reported it to Samuel. He had indeed heard about the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>"If I am not wrong, the anonymous man should be someone from the Han Clan and the Purple Soul Hall," Liusu added. As she spoke, Zheng's figure materialized in her mind.</p>

  <p>"What? Is that true?" Needless to say, Samuel was surprised.</p>

  <p>The person who had reported to him didn't say such details--after all, Zheng hadn't shown his Buddha Emperor Sword before. However, Liusu was right in the Hall of True Gods, so she had known about the news first-hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It seems that he has practiced Aunt Joy's Gods Killing Sword Array, but strangely, he used the illusory sword," she continued.</p>

  <p>"The illusory sword? That's impossible," Samuel noted and shook his head. As a Holy Being, he knew very well that proving godly warriors could not master the Cross-world Theurgy. While the ordinary True Gods might be able to develop the illusory sword by Power Shaping, they couldn't use it in a sword array, because without the power of the Cross-world Theurgy, they had to hold the illusory sword in their hands all the time.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Liusu didn't try to persuade her father and instead added, "Now that he has won 31 consecutive wins, his points should have risen to about 1.6 million."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Those are higher than Alfredo's points."</p>

  <p>Alfredo, a consummate True God and the leader of his clan, only had 1.26 million points in the Arena of Legends. Moreover, he had recently lost an open battle.</p>

  <p>Samuel was overjoyed. It was a great fortune for his clan to have such a talented disciple.</p>

  <p>"But today, Pearl suddenly appeared in the Hall of True Gods. She demanded the anonymous man to join her clan," his daughter disclosed.</p>

  <p>As Samuel heard those words, his smile quickly faded. He surely wasn't afraid of a little girl like Pearl. However, since the Dongfang Clan sent Pearl to make such a demand, it meant that they had already noticed the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>"What did the anonymous man say?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He asked her to fuck off," Liusu said with a little smile.</p>

  <p>Samuel frowned. "Then why did you come here today?"</p>

  <p>"Can you refuse the request if the Dongfang Clan asks you for the anonymous man?" Liusu sincerely asked. Her father had always catered to her wants ever since she was a child. This time, she hoped that he would agree again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Samuel remained quiet for a while and sighed heavily. "The truth is, I, as well as our clan, have been worried over the years. You are still young, so I don't want you to worry. If the anonymous man is really from our clan, I'm afraid I can't refuse the Dongfang Clan when they come."</p>

  <p>"Why? You know, he will make a great contribution to our clan!"</p>

  <p>Liusu responded a bit heatedly. Yet, Samuel stood firm and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's because the Time Sea is going to change again," he said in a serious voice.</p>
