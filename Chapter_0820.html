<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Danger lurked in every corner but Luo Zheng was not afraid.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was a relatively safe place.</p>

  <p>It had its own set of rules and wasn't affected by the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>Here, fighting was strictly prohibited and regulated except in the arenas.</p>

  <p>Any dispute, whether it was between mortal enemies or entire opposing races, had to be settled in the arena. Anyone who broke the rules and engaged in any fighting outside the arena would be hunted down and dealt with by all other races.</p>

  <p>Phoebe led him to a decently spacious hall, "This is the living quarters. The practice rooms here can be rented for a day with a few points. This one here is the most ordinary practice room but there are some pretty exclusive, secret ones that can cost up to 100 points per day."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow, "A hundred points a day?" he repeated. He had won two matches but had only accumulated a total of 20 points which was nowhere near enough to afford a more expensive room.</p>

  <p>Phoebe shrugged, "You heard what I said. The time flow rate in one of those practice rooms is ten to one."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows were raised higher, "Time flow rate? What's that?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Phoebe sighed and felt the need to explain to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The only way to change the speed at which time flowed was through the use of Time Law.</p>

  <p>After he was baptized, Luo Zheng had gained the comprehension of the nine different basic laws in the Upper World. However, there was one law that he had not understood and that was the Time Law.</p>

  <p>If one were to use a metaphor: time was the king, and space was the ruler - these two law powers were essentially the most powerful ones in the world.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Lineage Human did not have the Time Law's obelisk because they didn't have a master who had fully comprehended it.</p>

  <p>A practice room that altered time flow pleased Luo Zheng greatly.</p>

  <p>Time was running out.</p>

  <p>If he worked hard and obtained enough points, he would be able to enter the more expensive practice room and use it for his training. One day inside it would be equivalent to ten days of training on the outside world. One year would be equivalent to ten years. It was amazing!</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng was more concerned about the Time Law.</p>

  <p>"You said there are all sorts of cultivation methods here in the Tower of Sin," he said to Phoebe. "Are there cultivation methods that are related to the Time Law?"</p>

  <p>"I know some of them, but�" Phoebe trailed off, avoiding Zheng's eyes. "But what?" Luo Zheng pushed further.</p>

  <p>Phoebe answered him with a small smile instead, "You won't meet them by staying on the first floor. You'll have to go deeper."</p>

  <p>"Humph," Luo Zheng huffed. "How can I get to the next floor?"</p>

  <p>Phoebe shrugged once again. "One hundred points." The reply made Luo Zheng think: since he hadn't encountered any great difficulties on the first ground and the war fighters weren't much of a threat to him, it wouldn't be too difficult for him to get 100 points.</p>

  <p>Nodding, Luo Zheng dropped the subject. He had no plans of entering the next floor for the time being. He still wanted to scope the area and become more familiar with the rules of the tower before venturing even further down.</p>

  <p>Although he was confident in his strength, Luo Zheng was not stupid enough to disregard the existence of other fighters more powerful than him who lived deep inside the Tower of Sin. With his current strength levels, Luo Zheng wouldn't even stand a chance against a level-one warlord.</p>

  <p>After choosing and going inside his rented practice room, Luo Zheng immediately took out the token for the Tower of Sin and set it down in front of him.</p>

  <p>Although the token looked ordinary, it had been able to absorb the Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the Lucky Light, the token had begun to emit a faint white luster.</p>

  <p>Just as he triggered the token, the soft light began to flow into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>It gave Luo Zheng a sense of familiarity. The secret techniques of different races were all different, but still contained small slivers of similarity among them: this Lucky Light was very similar to the one in the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>The Lucky Light started to flow into Zheng's body and converge into his belly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his life vitality also started to move smoothly in his body.</p>

  <p>After a period of training, he had the feeling of an imminent breakthrough!</p>

  <p>Although it was only a small amount of Lucky Light, it was enough for him to ascend and break through.</p>

  <p>The eighth-level Illuminating Soul Realm warrior meant an eighth-level war fighter on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>His cultivation was improving, but it was still too slow.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to defeat Eddie, Luo Zheng would have to possess the strength of the warlord and inherit the power from the bottom level of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Eddie had long since proven that his luck was not to be underestimated back in the Wheel of Fortune. This luck might just work out in his favor and allow him to find a woman with a Purple Power Body that would allow him to activate the Lustful Demon Array at any given time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng must not allow that to happen. "Red dragon," he called out. "Now that a Path Platform has been opened, you have to fulfill your promise."</p>

  <p>It was time for him to cultivate the Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Luo Zheng had no idea what it meant or what it entailed for him save that it was a cultivation method used by the Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>The red dragon chuckled, "I knew you wouldn't forget."</p>

  <p>"Of course not!"</p>

  <p>After his activation of the Path Platform, Luo Zheng had been relentlessly chased by ogres and had no chance of cultivating at all.</p>

  <p>"The Transcendent Divine Might I'm teaching you is actually an abridged version. Nonetheless, it is so powerful that this abridged version would actually be better than others," the red dragon declared proudly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the red dragon proceeded, "Listen carefully now: this Transcendent Divine Might is called Stellar Body."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded once again with a poker face, "Oh?"</p>

  <p>"Any idea popped in your head?" The student did not answer, which struck a bit of a nerve with the red dragon. He truly did not have a shred of knowledge about what he was talking about. He huffed hotly, "Stellar Body allows its cultivator to absorb the star power into his own body and use it for himself! The more he absorbs, the more powerful he becomes."</p>

  <p>"Absorb the star power and use it for myself," Luo Zheng repeated and blinked his eyes in wide-eyed curiosity.</p>

  <p>His life vitality had greatly benefited from the destructive power of stars after he used the Sun Moon Stars Picture to visualize these heavenly bodies.</p>

  <p>However, he did not think that there was actually a method that could directly trigger the power of the stars.</p>

  <p>"The full power can only be released by opening the nine Divine Stars. You can practice it. I'm sure you can since you've already opened the Hundred Meetings Platform," the red dragon said. "However, do not forget that the Stellar Body belongs to the Transcendent Divine Might. It is abridged and you will only have the first half of it to practice with. I'm afraid that you may hit a bottleneck in the future."</p>

  <p>That future bottleneck wasn't something he was gonna worry about in the present. Now that he had been trapped in the Tower of Sin, he would have to use all means necessary to strengthen himself and this abridged Stellar Body was a surefire way to do just that.</p>

  <p>"To practice the Stella Body, you'll have to trigger one of the countless stars in the sky," the red dragon instructed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately looked up and came face to face with the practice room's boring ceiling, "Stars in the sky? How do I do that when I'm inside a practice room?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, sorry, my bad," the red dragon apologized. "I forgot to tell you that you can't practice the Stellar Body until there are actual stars in the sky."</p>

  <p>The red dragon actually had the gall to chuckle after leaving out such vital information.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt his heart drop in disappointment before sighing in frustration and leaving the practice room.</p>

  <p>Phoebe had been right outside, waiting for Luo Zheng. Seeing him leave the practice room, Phoebe immediately went up to Luo Zheng, "Breakthrough?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng merely nodded in reply.</p>

  <p>"Will you go to the arena again?"</p>

  <p>Phoebe couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>"Not now," Luo Zheng answered, deciding to wait outside the Tower of Sin to see if he could channel the power of the stars there.</p>

  <p>"Is that so? There are already several groups of people waiting for you here�"</p>

  <p>Phoebe's voice died away as six to seven ogres appeared out of nowhere and blocked their path.</p>

  <p>"Human kid�" one of them addressed Luo Zheng condescendingly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng groaned, "I don't have time for this!"</p>

  <p>He interrupted and refused before the ogre even had the chance to finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>"No time?" the ogre scoffed.</p>

  <p>"You don't get to choose, human."</p>

  <p>The other ogres laughed at his words but Luo Zheng wasn't having any of it.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to make a scene here?" he asked menacingly.</p>

  <p>"They won't fight with you in here but they can block your way out,"</p>

  <p>Phoebe said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The rule about fighting in the safe zone might be strict but that didn't mean there were no loopholes they could exploit.</p>

  <p>One of the most common methods was the use of death soldiers, sending them off for assassination. No matter if the target died, the death soldier would die anyway. A failed assassination would be impossible to be traced back to the mastermind while a successful one meant that the death soldier actually served out his very purpose and killed a talent from another race.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's strength had been enough to save himself from those death warriors.</p>

  <p>Another method was to carry out provocation and if that didn't work, then the simple strategy of being a huge blockade in the hallway also existed.</p>

  <p>Narrow roads divided the living quarters while ogres were tall, stocky monsters with bald heads that nearly touched the ceiling. If provocation didn't work, then a simple blockade would prevent anyone from ever going in or going out. Although it was annoying, they weren't really necessarily breaking any kind of rule.</p>
