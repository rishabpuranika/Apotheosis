<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3453 A Tremendous Change </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain joining the attack, naturally, the Separate Abyss race and the other large races grew vigilant. However, they knew that this would also accelerate the process of exhausting the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was concentrated on fierce attacks, they suddenly heard the sound of something falling from the sky at a great velocity.</p>

  <p>As they turned to look at where the sound was coming from, a figure landed onto the ground, with an impact so great that a crater formed around him.</p>

  <p>To their horror, the figure lying motionless at the center of the crater was Mount.</p>

  <p>"Mount lost so quickly?!"</p>

  <p>"Is the Evil God really that powerful?"</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to look at the sky. The Evil God still floated there arrogantly, with the shadow of Snake Goddess behind him.</p>

  <p>Huge wounds covered his body. It seemed Mount had injured him seriously.</p>

  <p>Alas, that didn't matter. Under the protection of several kinds of special bloodlines, the wounds started to heal instantly.</p>

  <p>Mount, on the other hand, was in a much worse condition. He was nearly split in half. On his face was a stunned expression, as he stared at the Evil God in the sky.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected that the Evil God had a strategy to defeat him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked down at Mount, gloating. Slowly, he descended from the air. "I'm satisfied with your bloodline, so just stay here in my world..."</p>

  <p>To the Evil God, Mount had been the biggest obstacle.</p>

  <p>If Mount died in his world, he could acquire Mount's bloodline token permanently.</p>

  <p>With it, killing the rest of the people would be a breeze.</p>

  <p>"This is bad..."</p>

  <p>Chaim watched uneasily.</p>

  <p>Although the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was on the verge of death, the Evil God might not give them time to finish her now.</p>

  <p>Chaim wasn't alone in his worry. The members of the other super forces and races were stunned and anxious as well. They were hoping to defeat the mother once and for all. However, it seemed the Evil God wouldn't give them the chance.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God was slowly descending, a space in the atmosphere not far from him suddenly distorted and fluctuated. Suddenly, a figure stumbled out of the space wave.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng emerged from the space wave, he surveyed the area. The scene that greeted him made him frown.</p>

  <p>He had been in that space for several years.</p>

  <p>However, after King Manard found the time node and sent him back, only a short while had passed in the real world.</p>

  <p>Now that he looked around, it seemed the whole world had actually changed.</p>

  <p>The once rust-colored earth was now a dark green, and the black smog that had once shrouded the sky was now white. The colors of the entire world had changed!</p>

  <p>Mount's eyes flitted to look at the figure that had emerged from the space. A flicker of excitement flashed in his eyes when he realized who the figure was.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng is back? How is this possible?'</p>

  <p>It was impossible even for Mount to return from the deleted space!</p>

  <p>Only the Chaos Ancient God behind him had the qualifications to do it!</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng..." Yan cried out joyfully.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Sally also shouted, unable to contain her excitement.</p>

  <p>Even Feng Ge smiled faintly, despite her usual cool disposition.</p>

  <p>Dorothy bit her lip. Even though she kept quiet, it was obvious she was overjoyed as well.</p>

  <p>"He..." Chaim shook his head in disbelief. "He..." He was at a loss for words. It seemed nothing could stop Luo Zheng. He always seemed to survive despite constantly facing grave danger.</p>

  <p>Standing outside the Chaotic Source World, Fuxi trembled in shock when he saw Luo Zheng's return.</p>

  <p>Like Mount, he also knew the meaning of deleting a piece of space.</p>

  <p>If one was exiled to that place, they would be completely lost in the destroyed space. It was impossible to return.</p>

  <p>Fuxi knitted his brows. He had complicated feelings towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, he was jealous that Luo Zheng had won the Chaos Ancient God's favor. On the other, he was happy to witness Luo Zheng grow in strength.</p>

  <p>Deep in his heart, he sincerely thought that Gerald had chosen the wrong person. Why should he place his hope on Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had really been lost to the destroyed space, it meant Gerald had indeed made the wrong choice.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had been considering sneaking to the bottom of the chaos to tell Gerald about it.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng was back!</p>

  <p>He had returned unscathed from the deleted space!</p>

  <p>As Fuxi was deep in thought, snow began to fall heavily. A thick layer of snow surrounded him, so tall that it reached his knees. However, Fuxi didn't notice. He murmured quietly to the giant skeleton in the distance, "You have a good eye..."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Evil God was also taken aback at Luo Zheng's sudden return.</p>

  <p>He paused in the air, and quickly put on a playful expression. "Well, I thought you'd never come back!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed the shadow of Snake Goddess behind the Evil God and his three heads and six arms. "Why do you possess the bloodline theurgies of the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race?"</p>

  <p>"You don't need to know that." The Evil God laughed. "You just need to obediently submit to me!" With a wink, the Evil God suddenly vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>"Spatial transference?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked.</p>

  <p>It was also because of Mount's token that he was banished into the void.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng had realized that Mount was the avatar of a Chaos Ancient God. The space token he exerted could naturally break the restriction of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>But how could the Evil God do it?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's reaction, however, was quick. The instant the Evil God disappeared, he rushed forward, a cyan feather floating above his head.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng had rushed forward, an energy beam of the shadow of Snake Goddess shot towards him, almost pressing against his back.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Be careful!" Dorothy cautioned. "He can make use of everyone's bloodline token!" Her eyes showed a trace of worry.</p>

  <p>"The bloodline theurgies of all the people... This..." Luo Zheng felt incredulous.</p>

  <p>He knew very well that it was a very terrible thing if the bloodline theurgies of these people were employed at the same time, and that the bloodline token of Mount was especially formidable.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng never would've expected that he would encounter such difficulty the moment he returned from the deleted space.</p>

  <p>Having failed to strike Luo Zheng, the Evil God vanished once more.</p>

  <p>Just then, Mount, who was lying motionless on the ground, suddenly came back to his senses. Gathering his wits, he teleported out of this strange world.</p>

  <p>As Mount moved outside of the world, the Evil God suddenly rushed out of the void. As they locked eyes, Mount smiled slyly at him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God furrowed his brows in fury. He could only acquire Mount's power if he killed him in this world!</p>

  <p>The Evil God had killed Mya in order to enrage Mount to a point of recklessly attacking him without escaping even when he knew it was in vain.</p>

  <p>Everything was going according to plan, so he only needed to land one last blow and Mount would've died on the spot.</p>

  <p>He never expected Luo Zheng would return out of nowhere, and was momentarily distracted.</p>

  <p>With the help of the spatial transference, he thought it would be easy for him to launch a sneak attack on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't think that Mount would escape as he shifted his focus on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The bloodline token of Mount also disappeared from the body of the Evil God, along with the ability to use the spatial transference. Consequently, the Evil God was restricted by the Chaotic Source World and was kicked out of the space channel.</p>
