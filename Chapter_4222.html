<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4222 Remind Zheng </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that he was fighting avatars of the humanoid creature, but he was wrong.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and the others on the altar watched as Zheng slashed at black palm-sized bugs, one after another, with his heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Each time Zheng took out a black bug, it'd explode into a faint light, which would then enter his body.</p>

  <p>As more and more light flew into Zheng's body, his expression became wilder and wilder.</p>

  <p>Little did Zheng know that the real humanoid being was calmly floating nearby.</p>

  <p>As the humanoid creature clapped his hands and opened them, black bugs emerged from his palms and flew towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was the Dream-breaking Bug.</p>

  <p>The bugs were created for the humanoid creature to perform the Soul Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Fully aware of what Zheng was capable of with his sword, the humanoid creature had no intention of fighting him head-on.</p>

  <p>When he summoned the black cloud for the Probability Extreme Form, his plan to crush Zheng by driving him crazy had commenced.</p>

  <p>When Zheng destroyed the black cloud, he had fallen right into the humanoid creature's trap.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not native to the Stellar World, so he didn't know much about the theurgies there. Additionally, the spirit inside his heavy sword was not very intelligent. They both fell into the Soul Extreme Form easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was a breeze for the humanoid being to lure Zheng and his sword into his trap.</p>

  <p>"Kill as many as you want. The Dream-breaking Bugs will poison you and turn you into a mindless killer. That way, you will be insane for the rest of your life..." the humanoid creature quietly murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>When the people on the altar saw this, they also fell into a state of panic.</p>

  <p>"It looks like that he has fallen into an illusion...." the Snake Goddess said, her voice filled with worry.</p>

  <p>"What is that light he keeps absorbing?"</p>

  <p>"This is not good..."</p>

  <p>Discussion broke out among the crowd on the altar. From the looks of it, the illusion was difficult to break.</p>

  <p>Although they were keenly aware that Zheng was trapped in an illusion, there was nothing they could do to help.</p>

  <p>Even the Monkey Masters and the Bird Masters couldn't risk coming to Zheng's aid, how much more those at the Eternal Realm?</p>

  <p>They knew that the humanoid being was too powerful for them to deal with. Even without using the Light of Annihilation, he could finish off Treacherous Beings. He could even destroy their coordinates, preventing them from coming back from the dead.</p>

  <p>"We need to make Zheng snap out of it!" a human spirit cried out.</p>

  <p>"Who can do that?" another human spirit asked.</p>

  <p>Although they were Treacherous Beings, they trembled at the thought of eternal death.</p>

  <p>While everyone hesitated in fear, Lawler suddenly spoke up. "I will remind him."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Lawler?" Duran asked in a low voice. He didn't want to see his comrade get himself killed for nothing.</p>

  <p>"My eyes can see past all illusions," Lawler answered. "I am gonna give it a shot."</p>

  <p>"If you fail to break it, you will die," Duran warned him.</p>

  <p>"If we sit here and wait, it'll only be a matter of time before we get killed,"</p>

  <p>Lawler snapped impatiently.</p>

  <p>'Since the humanoid creature's goal is to downgrade the world, he would definitely kill all the Treacherous Beings. That means all the creatures from the forth-grade world will be slaughtered...</p>

  <p>Lawler's right. We can't just stand by and do nothing. We can't give up, even if there is just a sliver of hope.'</p>

  <p>As these thoughts raced through Duran's mind, he fell silent.</p>

  <p>So did the others.</p>

  <p>They all understood what was at stake here.</p>

  <p>Thus, no one dissuaded him from going to Zheng's aid. Without further hesitation, Lawler flew towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as Lawler took action, Hamilton of the Black House followed suit. Suddenly, he threw a pair of huge scissors and leapt into the air.</p>

  <p>They were the Dream-breaking Scissors, made by the Bold Conjecture House. This magic treasure could break any illusion.</p>

  <p>The moment Lawler launched himself into the air, two beams of colorful light shot out from his eyes. The light streaked through the sky and shot towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>In addition, under Hamilton's control, the scissors opened their blades in Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>All this didn't escape the humanoid being.</p>

  <p>Contempt was written all over his face when he saw what was happening.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the fifth-grade world were used to showing their emotions; the humanoid creature wasn't spared from this.</p>

  <p>He knew there was no need to stop them.</p>

  <p>The Soul Extreme Form was much more complicated than ordinary illusions.</p>

  <p>Generally, illusions often covered a designated area, creating a dreamlike scene.</p>

  <p>However, the Soul Extreme Form worked on a specific object, as opposed to an area. Since Zheng was haunted by the Soul Extreme Form, the humanoid creature was confident there was nothing that Lawler and Hamilton could do to save Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have no chance of winning whatsoever, you should know your place and stay out of this," the humanoid creature sneered haughtily.</p>

  <p>As he watched Lawler and Hamilton, his six pairs of eyes began to flash intensely.</p>

  <p>Lawler and Hamilton abruptly stopped in their tracks, as though frozen in place. Then, bubbles appeared on their bodies, until they melted into a puddle of white, translucent mud. Unfortunately, their coordinates weren't spared, and vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>A dead silence fell over the altar again.</p>

  <p>Facing the humanoid being, they felt as weak as ants.</p>

  <p>Not only were they unable to fight against such a powerful existence, but they couldn't even figure out what method he was using against them.</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>Someone sighed and sat on the ground, his head drooping dejectedly. He had given up.</p>

  <p>Some clenched their fists, glaring at the sky helplessly.</p>

  <p>Some were angry, but they didn't dare make a sound.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess tilted her head as she watched Zheng continue slaying the black bugs one by one. Her eyebrows furrowed deeply as she tried to come up with a solution. Suddenly, her eyes lit up decisively. "I will go myself," she said to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"What?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven asked confusedly, caught in a daze.</p>

  <p>"I am gonna head for the primitive land!" the Snake Goddess said firmly.</p>

  <p>'Since Zheng is trapped in this illusion, his heavy sword and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord who is in Zheng's mind are also stuck there, ' she thought silently. 'Despite that, we can communicate with Zheng in the primitive land.'</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven perked up. "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded.</p>

  <p>Without wasting any time, the Primeval Lord of Heaven took out the Descending Ring and made it float above the Snake Goddess's head.</p>

  <p>The Descending Ring then emitted a golden light that enveloped the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Snake Goddess was transported to the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Although the humanoid creature noticed this, he didn't pay it any heed.</p>

  <p>Again, he was confident this weakling wouldn't be able to do a thing to ruin his plans.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess arrived at the Pear Hill, she headed straight for the Civilization Artifact of the human race. She was in such a rush, she didn't even bother greeting the people there.</p>

  <p>When she finally reached it, the Snake Goddess stretched out her hand and pressed it against the Civilization Artifact. Activating the artifact, she tried to speak to Zheng. Since she was in the primitive land, which was actually Zheng's inner world, she hoped that she might be able to reach Zheng and free him from the illusion.</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact began to flash with a green light. "Zheng, can you hear me?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>She waited for a bit, but she didn't get any response.</p>

  <p>She tried several more times, but Zheng still didn't respond.</p>

  <p>"So, this isn't working..." The Snake Goddess lowered her head, her shoulders hunched in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Eternal Realm warriors of the current chaotic era like the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi walked up to her.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, what happened in Jade Pure Realm? Why are you in such a hurry?" the Snake Goddess of the current chaotic era asked.</p>

  <p>It was actually kind of weird to talk to oneself. But noticing that the real Snake Goddess was so anxious, she speculated that they must have encountered a big problem.</p>
