<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 830 The Secret Of The Tower Of Sin </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was a giant building, but it was inverted. Its peak was deeply embedded into the ground.</p>

  <p>If Zheng wanted to reach the bottom of the tower, it basically meant that he had to enter the top floor.</p>

  <p>"What's at the top of the tower?" Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Immortal Mist had told him that there was an incomparably important and powerful inheritance at the bottom of the Tower of Sin, and for that very inheritance, Immortal Mist had even given up his right of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>There must be something very important there.</p>

  <p>But Zheng knew nothing about what it was.</p>

  <p>"You don't know?" Elder Jing looked at Zheng with a strange expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the sacred places on the Sea God Continent had been developed based on the Tower of Sin. Every single warrior on this continent knew that in order to reach a higher cultivation level, they needed to enter the Tower of Sin. Only by entering the top of the Tower of Sin would a warrior get a chance to stand at the top of this continent.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was not from the Purple Heart Sacred Place, how could he not know about the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>The information wasn't a big secret, so Elder Jing immediately told him,</p>

  <p>"At the bottom of the Tower of Sin, there is a huge cave. We call it the Dark Nether Cave. It is filled with Dark Nether Death Light for almost the entire year. Even if a level ten war lord were to enter the cave during those times, he would be instantly killed by the Dark Nether Death Light."</p>

  <p>"Dark Nether Death Light? It can instantly kill a level ten war lord?!" Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>In the Cursed Land, the strongest warriors were level ten war lords only.</p>

  <p>War sages were unable to enter. Otherwise they would be killed instantly by the curse. Then who could enter the Dark Nether Cave without being killed?</p>

  <p>Elder Jing saw Zheng's doubtful expressions and immediately explained,</p>

  <p>"Because of the Dark Nether Death Light, we are unable to enter the Dark Nether Cave for most of the year. However, every year, for one single month, the Dark Nether Death Light gets greatly weakened. At that time, all races would enter the cave to look for opportunities."</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was a very important building to every sacred place for two major reasons. First, it was a breeding place for warriors. As long as a warrior had both— a significantly high amount of talent, and a high cultivation level— he could use the Lucky Light obtained in the Tower of Sin to greatly improve himself. And the second reason was the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>To date, the opportunities each sacred place had obtained from the Dark Nether Cave were unimaginable. For example, the Purple Heart Sacred Place was built by one of the human warriors, who had once obtained a seat in the Tower of Sin and found a great opportunity in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>He was then known as Purple Heart War Lord.</p>

  <p>It was precisely because of that opportunity that the Purple Heart War Lord had been able to step foot inside the Soul Sea Realm and lead the human race to establish the Purple Heart Sacred Place. This allowed the human race to gain a foothold on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>"I have to get a seat just to enter the Dark Nether Cave?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing smiled slightly, shook his head and said, "Not everyone necessarily gets a seat. According to the rules of the Tower of Sin, each seat grants the seat-bearing race five licenses to enter the Dark Nether Cave. If you can enter the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin, you may be able to enter the Dark Nether Cave once you get a license."</p>

  <p>"We humans have four seats, which means we have a total of twenty licenses?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Elder Jing nodded. "If you can enter the tenth floor when the Dark Nether Cave opens, we can consider giving you a license."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up and he smiled, "Thank you, Elder Jing."</p>

  <p>Elder Jing shook his head and said, "We humans have been weak for so many years. We have to help each other all along."</p>

  <p>In fact, the human race did not lack talents. On the contrary, the elders in the Purple Heart Sacred Place were quite powerful. Otherwise, the grand sacred place would have been destroyed by the other races long ago. What went against them was the fact that the human race had not produced a new and strong warrior for a long time now.</p>

  <p>For example, in the sacred place of the Demon Night, divine-level talents like Teresa would appear almost every year. In the past ten years, the human race had only produced three divine-level talents, and one of them had even died in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>If this situation was not changed and the younger generation failed to keep up, then when the elders of the Purple Heart Sacred Place ran out of their lifespans and finally kicked the bucket, the grand sacred place would truly decline.</p>

  <p>Just as they were chatting, a thunderous laughter came from the entrance of the tavern. Two figures that were the size of small mountains walked in.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, I'm afraid there won't be any licenses for humans this year. Human boy, it's useless even if you thank him!" The one who spoke was an ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>War lords usually stayed on the eleventh to fifteenth floors and rarely entered the lower floors. Elder Jing had especially come down to see Zheng.</p>

  <p>These two ogre war lords had also come to the second floor for Zheng only.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Don is right. Humans only have four seats. And to be frank, I wonder if they can keep those seats this year. That human brat called Elmer Ning has been cultivating in seclusion for a long time, but no matter how long he stays in seclusion, he will be still killed by my single slap. Ha-ha!" sneered the other ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>"Brat, why don't you join us? We have twenty-six seats! That's over a hundred licenses. It would be easy to bring you along!" Don mocked.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing's face darkened.</p>

  <p>Although there were conflicts between various races in the Tower of Sin, they usually dealt with each other in the arena. It was rare for them to provoke others in such a manner. These two ogres were war lords, but they were acting like assholes.</p>

  <p>Although humans were weak, they could not afford to be humiliated in front of others like this. Elder Jing was about to speak up when Zheng himself suddenly stood up.</p>

  <p>He said with a smile, "Guys, do you know a war general called Boris?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He's the most talented warrior of our Flaming Ogre Sacred Place!"</p>

  <p>Don replied with a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>"Boris is good," Zheng complimented.</p>

  <p>Don replied proudly, "Of course he is. Our Flaming Ogre Sacred Place is full of talents. He is the most talented one among all the talents."</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying that I admire his talent," Zheng suddenly said seriously. "In your opinion, Boris' talent is pretty good, but it's not worth mentioning in my eyes. I'm saying that his mentality is much better than yours. Although you are war lords, you act like hooligans. Other than your cultivation levels, what else do you really have that can justify your title of war lords?</p>

  <p>Strength? Aura?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's words were so harsh that the two ogres were lost for words.</p>

  <p>Don's face darkened. He suddenly took two steps forward and his majestic aura pressed down on Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing also quietly got up and was about to stand in front of Zheng, but Zheng gently waved his hand, signaling to Elder Jing not to do so. Instead, Zheng took two steps towards Don. The two were now only a few inches apart.</p>

  <p>War fighters would probably shiver in the face of a war lord, especially after being oppressed by his soul pressure. It was highly likely that they would get injured.</p>

  <p>Fighting was prohibited in the safe area. But the ogres were noted for their overbearing manners. Even if there was a dispute, the ogres involved would eventually get away with it unharmed. After all, they had twenty-six seats among the more than a hundred seats in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Don had not intended to blow up the situation. He had only wanted to scare the shit out of this human brat.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had had a faint smile on his face from beginning to end. He stared at Don as if he was not afraid of him at all, and then sneered, "You're merely a level one war lord. You think you are somebody? Your aura is even inferior to that of Boris. Other than your cultivation level, you are nothing."</p>

  <p>When Elder Jing saw Zheng's calm expression, he was both surprised and happy. What he didn't know was that, even a war sage from the Purple Heart Sacred Place wouldn't be able to suppress Zheng with just his aura, let alone a mere war lord. The war sages of the Sea God Continent were at the same level as the warriors at the Life and Death Realm of the Central Region. Back in that place, Zheng had remained unmoved even while facing Eddie's oppressive aura. So how could this war lord affect him?</p>

  <p>"Arrogant!" Seeing that his aura was indeed unable to suppress Zheng, Don felt somewhat helpless. It was just as the rumors said, Zheng was indeed a monster.</p>

  <p>"Arrogant? Ha-ha!" This time, it was Zheng who laughed heartily. "Let me show you whether I'm arrogant or not. I'll let you feel the true aura I have!"</p>

  <p>After saying that, Zheng stared at Don, his eyes lighting up. With his soul at the Fighting Soul Realm, he could cast forth quite an intimating aura.</p>
