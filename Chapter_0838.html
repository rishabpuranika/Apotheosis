<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 838 Yolande (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Upon noticing this, Olivia did not seem to care about such trivial matters. It was quite the opposite, as she had spoken highly of Luo Zheng every time he was brought up in her conversations. This fact was infuriating to Dylon who picked up on the girl's unbridled excitement whenever she talked about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clearly irked by the recent development, Olivia paying attention to another man surprisingly left a sour taste in his mouth. These days, having a simple conversation with Olivia had been aggravating. This was because the girl always managed to avert whatever topic they were talking about into another discussion about the newcomer. Needless to say, Dylon always found himself gritting his teeth and glaring at his shoes after Olivia finished fussing over the other guy. With each passing day, he withheld his bitter jealousy to himself as it grew more and more.</p>

  <p>What was more disheartening was that he had not thought of any effective methods to change his current fate. The young man had desperately cultivated during this period of time and within the last month alone, he ventured into the arena four times and won all of those four matches. If the circumstance had been exactly the same as it was in the past, such an impressive achievement would have already left the entirety of the Purple Heart Sacred Place absolutely speechless. In addition to this, the human race would have definitely praised him endlessly and even significantly rewarded him.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for him, all the attention of the people were all on the mighty Luo Zheng now, as if they had seemingly forgotten the existence of Dylon's divine-level talent and impeccable strength.</p>

  <p>Upon discerning the sudden change of heart of the people lately, his displeasure was obvious in his face as he donned a stoic expression upon spotting Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The structure of each floor inside the Tower of Sin was similar to its other floors. After having followed Olivia down the stairs and around a corner, they were immediately greeted with the sight of the large arena. Just by scanning his eyes across the arena, he felt a shiver from the bottom of his spine and he suppressed a sudden tremble.</p>

  <p>Situated on the arena was a petite figure constantly moving around and hovering above in the air. Needless to say, the form attracted his attention to no end.</p>

  <p>Tilting his head to one side, Luo Zheng mused that it must be a woman from the human race. The lady currently fighting in the arena was dressed in a colorful long skirt that did not seem to hinder her at all as she constantly dodged the attacks from an orc gracefully. Given that the orc was also a tenth level war general, being short and stout was not indicative of his power due to the strength he harbored in every muscle.</p>

  <p>Every time the forceful energy burst out from the orc's body, the axe he held tightly in his grip would follow through with a swing akin to a deathly cyclone that he directed towards the woman without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The loud noise echoed throughout the floor but the human girl managed to dodge the forceful attack from the heavy axe. As the weapon of the orc missed its target, cut sharply through the air, and subsequently sliced through the floor with an immense force instead, it was briefly stuck in the surface of the arena. The moment the orc pulled his heavy axe out of the battling platform, the huge crack it left on the ground automatically narrowed as it gradually closed, the ground itself vibrating while doing so.</p>

  <p>Not a long moment had passed before the floor returned to its normal state.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the Tower of Sin possessed such a miraculous ability to mend the damage caused by intense battles. Otherwise, the tower would have been riddled with various holes and misshapen floors after so many years of ravaging.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze continued to be fixed on the human woman from the beginning up until the end, confused by the sight of the lady in a colorful skirt. Then it finally hit him as he muttered to himself, "Isn't that Yolande? What is she doing here?"</p>

  <p>The other warriors who were busy spectating the match with him did not hear Luo Zheng, but Olivia, who happened to be standing the closest to him picked up on what he asked. Turning her head towards his direction, Olivia looked at him with clear surprise written on her face before asking, "Did you just say Yolande? How do you know her?"</p>

  <p>It was reasonable for Olivia to be startled at the young man because he did not originally come from the Purple Heart Sacred Place in the first place.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng apparently knowing Yolande was undeniably strange.</p>

  <p>Although Yolande came from the Purple Heart Sacred Place herself, not many people knew her personally as her background remained mysterious and shady. One of the only certain facts about her was that she had always been at the upper floor of the Tower of Sin together with another few individuals in the Purple Heart Sacred Place. Given that point, it was next to unfathomable and practically impossible that Luo Zheng could know about Yolande.</p>

  <p>At the mere sight of the woman, a vague memory of when they were in the White Emperor City popped up in his mind.</p>

  <p>Just after leaving the White Emperor City, Luo Zheng had immediately participated in the All Peaks Competition. In addition, he had not stopped there and directly took the Cloud Road test--since then, he had never got a chance to see her again. Fate seemed to be a funny thing, as Luo Zheng assumed that if he were to see Yolande again, it would be when he rescued Yan from the hands of Eddie and returned to the Eastern Region after that.</p>

  <p>In the Eastern Region, there were still some matters that Luo Zheng had to deal with.</p>

  <p>At that point in time, Zheng's strength was admittedly not powerful enough, hence, he could only put aside the matter of Mu Ning as there were still Internal Elixir Realm masters in the palace which he stood no chance to fight against back then. With the current state of Zheng's strength now, he could definitely return to the Eastern Region but he still had to face Eddie, a formidable opponent!</p>

  <p>Never would Zheng's wildest imagination even conjure the sudden appearance of the young girl in a colorful dress and wooden clogs, especially on a continent that was drastically far away from the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Dumbfounded, Luo Zheng frowned and thought to himself, 'Why would she suddenly appear in the Tower of Sin of the Sea God Continent?' Shaking his head, he furrowed his eyebrows and looked up once more at the arena.</p>

  <p>What exactly was going on?</p>

  <p>On the battling platform, Yolande's vibrant and long skirt constantly fluttered about in the air like a leaf dancing in the wind, as she nimbly avoided the forceful attacks of the orc's axe. With precision and grace exuding from her frame, her jade-like fair-skinned hand gently waved in the air. Interestingly, what she used to attack was not the power of her life vitality, nor had she summoned an enchanted barrier; it was more like a kind of finger movement.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Bursting forth from Yolande's finger was a forceful energy that heavily hit the orc's giant axe.</p>

  <p>It was unknown to all of them how heavy the huge axe had been as it seemed to take great strength for the orc to hold it in an upright position.</p>

  <p>However, after being hit by the energy that sprouted from Yolande's finger, the top-grade fairy weapon was suddenly pitted all over on its previously sharp surface.</p>

  <p>"Is her name really Yolande?"</p>

  <p>The young man slowly asked with apprehension.</p>

  <p>Nodding at the still man, she affirmed, "Yes". In the meantime, Olivia glanced at Luo Zheng in confusion, feeling a bout of oddness well up in her chest from Luo Zheng asking such a strange question. Since he knew Yolande's name from the start, why would he be so uncertain and have her confirm the name once again? Such thoughts echoed loudly in her mind as she tried to figure Luo Zheng out.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Luo Zheng was really not that sure himself.</p>

  <p>The Yolande that was currently in his line of sight had the same name and appearance as the Yolande in his memories from the White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>Strangely, the Yolande before his very eyes made him feel distant. As he exhaled deeply and bit the inner side of cheek anxiously, he asked himself quietly one more time, "Are you really the Yolande I know?"</p>
