<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1501 How To Obtain A Satisfying Heavenly Destiny (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Hi guys. I seem to have missed something interesting."</p>

  <p>It was the laughter of a young girl.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had heard this voice before. The first time he had used the Roaring Token, this girl had replied to him and sung a beautiful song.</p>

  <p>She had then fallen silent for more than a year.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, the young girl's voice unexpectedly resounded throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>"No big deal. I was just surrounded and attacked by a bunch of Supreme Lords," Luo Luo Zheng replied with his Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>He was just surrounded and attacked by a bunch of Supreme Lords?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's indifferent tone rendered all the intelligent creatures in the universe speechless and angered the Supreme Lords who were rushing back to their own races. But what difference did it make? It was impossible to pull Luo Luo Zheng out of the Immortal Mansion, and they could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng not only had an indestructible space treasure, he also had a Roaring Token that could be used an unlimited number of times. They were upset enough that they couldn't do anything about Luo Luo Zheng, and now he was even bragging about it.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords felt a grievance they had never felt before.</p>

  <p>"Awesome!" the mysterious girl praised.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked on indifferently as he placed the Roaring Token before him.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't respond to the girl if it wasn't absolutely necessary. He had nothing to do with her, and the two of them had only communicated with each other once by using their Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng understood that the Roaring Token in the girl's hand could be used an unlimited number of times, just like his own.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Roaring Token was given to him by his master and was not a product of the current round of heavens. The Roaring Token in his hand and the Immortal Mansion were both products that surpassed the heavens.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng guessed that this girl was not from the universe.</p>

  <p>She might also be an existence that surpassed the heavens.</p>

  <p>The only reason Luo Luo Zheng wanted to communicate with her was to track down Yan.</p>

  <p>"You are just being modest. These were a group of Supreme Lords. They are the supreme existences in the universe. Let me see. Hmm... The Heavenly Destiny of Shadows, the Heavenly Destiny of Darkness, the Heavenly Destiny of Strength, and the Heavenly Destiny of Earth. These four are missing. You really are amazing!"</p>

  <p>All the Supreme Lords and the world lords were startled at the girl's words.</p>

  <p>Her origins had always been a mystery.</p>

  <p>She would use the Roaring Token to sing, causing beast attacks.</p>

  <p>In any case, many Supreme Lords knew that this girl had an extraordinary background, and that she was a character they couldn't afford to offend. But they just didn't know enough about her. There was no Supreme Lord that would waste Roaring Tokens in meaningless conversations with her. There weren't that many Roaring Tokens in the universe, after all.</p>

  <p>The girl had just casually pointed out the four missing Heavenly Destinies. This was truly unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Carrying a Heavenly Destiny was in truth carrying a Law of Causality in the universe. A Supreme Lord that carried a Law of Causality was an absolute authority in this domain, and was able to control the ultimate strength of this sort of law.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destiny of Shadows used to be carried by Supreme Lord Gunter, which was why he had controlled the most powerful Shadow Splitting Technique in the entire universe. Theoretically speaking, he could split his own shadow into countless parts and fill the entire universe.</p>

  <p>But while this method could be used to exterminate an entire race or a supreme world, it wasn't too useful in dealing with other Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>After all, no matter how many shadows there were, they were still inferior to Supreme Lord Gunter himself. This didn't mean that Supreme Lord Gunter was weak. It was just that the Heavenly Destiny he had previously carried was rather weak. When the five Supreme Lords had been fighting, Supreme Lord Gunter had created countless shadows. This would help him hide his whereabouts. But the moment these shadows had appeared, they had been drawn into the attacks of the other Supreme Lords and completely annihilated. In the end, Supreme Lord Gunter had been killed.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord that had carried the Heavenly Destiny of Darkness had mastered the extremes of the Dark Law. The Heavenly Destiny of Strength and the Heavenly Destiny of Earth both had their own miraculous uses, but in the end, they were still the weaker Laws of Causality.</p>

  <p>After the four Supreme Lords had been killed, the Heavenly Destinies they had carried would have been removed from the heavens and transformed into four brand-new Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Every time a new Crown of Destiny appeared, there would be a new Heavenly Destiny and a new Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>This new Law of Causality could be either a low-rank one or a top-rank one.</p>

  <p>If a world lord obtained a top-rank Law of Causality, they could take a leap and become a top-rank Supreme Lord, the strongest in the entire universe. This could change the fate of an entire race.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race had used this rule to become the top race in the universe.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, there were two Supreme Lords in the Celestial Position race. One of them carried the Heavenly Destiny of Rebirth.</p>

  <p>The corresponding Law of Causality of the Heavenly Destiny of Rebirth could revive those who had died.</p>

  <p>This Law of Causality was not particularly strong and didn't have much of an effect during battles.</p>

  <p>But back then, in the Celestial Position race, an extremely powerful world lord had appeared and received the title of the golden Celestial Position from the Talent Tablet. This world lord had been waiting for a long time for the chance to obtain a Crown of Destiny and carry the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>This world lord had waited for close to 200, 000 years when one of the Supreme Lords finally died, and the world lord seized his chance. The members of the Celestial Position had successfully obtained the Crown of Destiny for him. The world lord had successfully carried the Heavenly Destiny, but the result wasn't satisfactory.</p>
