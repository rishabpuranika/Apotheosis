<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 295 Yates Mo (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Throughout the Eastern Region, no one at the Illuminating Soul Realm would subject themselves to taking direction from anyone who was not an influential master.</p>

  <p>There was a rich merchant of G County, and he could afford to employ several nature creatures as his personal bodyguards, which was rare for a man of his station. However, it was pure fantasy to think he could hire any of the masters in the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Still, the members of the Zhang Clan could.</p>

  <p>The Zhang Clan employed multiple Illuminating Soul Realm masters.</p>

  <p>These masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm willingly remained in the employ of the Zhang Clan to assist with the clan at critical times because they valued the connections along with the resources that the Zhang Clan possessed.</p>

  <p>More importantly though, since the Zhang Clan financially supported those same masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm while they were growing up, they served loyally.</p>

  <p>This was the biggest reason the masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm remained with the clan.</p>

  <p>As the third son in the Zhang Clan, Wurth was raised in the environment which gave him a natural sensitivity to this aspect of how things were.</p>

  <p>In Wurth's opinion, if Luo Luo Zheng managed to defy the odds and gain entry into the Illuminating Soul Realm someday, his strength would rival any official at the Zhang Clan.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Wurth wanted to invest in Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He didn't invest money though because Luo Luo Zheng wasn't lacking in that department, even going so far as to commission Wurth in the auctioning of heavenly essence which would in turn earn Wurth some money.</p>

  <p>No, Luo Luo Zheng had no need of Wurth's money, so, instead, Wurth invested his time, companionship in the form of building a friendship with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He knew how much Luo Luo Zheng valued sentiment, friendship and respect above all other things, and although sometimes Luo Luo Zheng would react emotionally, it was evident that he cared about his friends and brothers around him more than others.</p>

  <p>For this reason alone Wurth was willing to help Nory and didn't consider the cost immediately.</p>

  <p>Even if he put that aspect aside, Wurth would be involved because he viewed Luo Luo Zheng and others as his brothers.</p>

  <p>He was dwelling on that information, when a group of men and women entered.</p>

  <p>A busy servant saw the group as they came in and stopped what he was doing to rush over to them. He nodded as he bowed and greeted them warmly, "Hello, Young Master Yates, welcome back. Please, have a seat here. This table was specially arranged for you and your guests."</p>

  <p>While he spoke, several other servants hurried to set the chairs and table in order. They laid a soft napped tablecloth over the table before laying out fruit and snacks on it.</p>

  <p>Young Master Yates smiled, graciously inviting his friends to sit down.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at the young master dressed in a black robe. When he glimpsed the companions, he noticed they too wore black robes.</p>

  <p>The Mo Clan might be weaker now, but it wasn't difficult for the children to become inner disciples, and this only illuminated just how low Nory's position was in his clan.</p>

  <p>After being seated, the young master Yates looked around the room, and when he saw Nory, he fixated on him. After staring at Nory, he glanced from Nory to Luo Luo Zheng, Wurth, and Sean, noticing that the friends accompanying Nory were all outer disciples dressed in white robes.</p>

  <p>Raising his thick brows, Yates sneered at Nory and asked, "Well there Nory, what brings you venturing out of Drizzle Peak today?" When he'd finished his mocking inquiry, the young master laughed.</p>

  <p>Nory blinked obliviously as he replied, "As the rule, I normally attend family reunions, Yates, why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," responded Yates while he shook his head and went on, "I knew with your capabilities, you'd be accepted into the Cloud Sect and have the forte to persevere. But, can I ask you; why have you returned now, and with such loser friends?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't news to anyone there how the inner disciples from Cloud Sect looked down on outer disciples, constantly.</p>

  <p>Inner and outer disciples that were members of the same peak might get along well, but, inner disciples from any of the other peaks were unwilling to see outer disciples as anything more than their whipping boys.</p>

  <p>All the disciples with Yates were from Egret Peak.</p>

  <p>Egret Peak was sixteenth ranked peak at Cloud Sect, making it the midway point between the top and bottom.</p>

  <p>The inner disciples with Yates noticed the Drizzle Peak logo on Luo Zheng's and Wurth's chests and rolled their eyes disdainfully. Considering that Luo Luo Zheng and the others were from the peak that was the lowest ranking at the Cloud Sect, and on top of that, they were all outer disciples, Yates' companions saw Nory and his friends as insignificant.</p>

  <p>Nory didn't care if he was being insulted, he'd been dealing with worse his entire life. However, he found it difficult to maintain self-control when his friends were, and in a menacing tone said, "Yates, these are my friends, not losers. You would do well to watch how you speak to them."</p>

  <p>"Oh really?" replied Yates, with an inflection in his voice that denoted his growing interest. He stared at Nory's flustered expression, which always amused him, and had heard the exasperation in his voice, which he enjoyed. Yates asked, "So, they're not losers. Maybe you can share why you were placed in Drizzle Peak, the lowest ranking one within the Cloud Sect? Logically speaking, the outer disciples from Drizzle Peak can be the least powerful of all the disciples at the Cloud Sect. At least, in my opinion. It is better not to enter the Cloud Sect than to remain at Drizzle Peak since it's where losers are cultivated."</p>

  <p>"Yates, what the hell is that supposed to mean?" shouted Nory as he jumped to his feet angrily.</p>

  <p>Only half of the guests had arrived, and the feast hadn't started yet. When other guests heard Nory shouting loudly, one after another turned to see what was going on, and even the actors up on stage stopped singing to see what was happening.</p>

  <p>Yates concentrated on rising from his seat slowly, smirking, and having a tough time restraining the laughter he felt welling up in him. Nory was always such a weak target who Yates thought was easy to bully, until today. Odd that today Nory had been found to have a backbone. Yates wondered why Nory suddenly had the courage to stand up to him. Was Nory relying on these guys to stand against Yates?</p>

  <p>Earlier when Yates entered, he had examined Nory's friends.</p>

  <p>All the disciples from noble clans had keen vision.</p>

  <p>First, he took in the fact that Luo Luo Zheng, Wurth, and Sean were attired in white robes, then he scrutinized them to ensure they all came from lower class families without noble ties.</p>
