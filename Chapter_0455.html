<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 455 The Sword Mountain (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Patrick looked at Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming, then closed his eyes. He hadn't had a psychological fluctuation in his brain for a long time, but today there was a slight perturbation in there. He wanted to make it go away, since this was a great taboo in practicing Buddhist cultivation method.</p>

  <p>"No fluctuation is calm, no change is constant. Sooner or later, I will have to fight the two. And I will defeat them. Calm down, calm down!"</p>

  <p>Patrick murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>"Did they both just realize the consummation of the sword intent at the same time?" wondered Kenneth. He couldn't help rubbing his rough hands together with an expression of ecstasy on his face.</p>

  <p>There were not many people in the world who would be able to comprehend the sword intent. One who could cultivate the sword intent was considered genius and was sure to become a successful practitioner in the Eastern Region. As for those who could realize the consummation of the sword intent, they were often listed among the top ranks of the Cloud Sect! All the saints and elders wanted such top disciples listed under them as personal disciples.</p>

  <p>Tianming was a man of ordinary origins. After he was admitted to Cloud Sect, numerous elders had wanted to take him under themselves as their own disciple because of his excellent performance. But Tianming felt a strong sense of belonging to Skytop Peak and was not willing to be a personal disciple. Therefore, he had been staying at the Skytop Peak until now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had cultivated swordsmanship only for a short time, and his skills of Sword Steps had been learned from Tianming stealthily. Until this competition had taken place, most people in Cloud Sect didn't even know his name. So no elder had been keen on recruiting him to be his own disciple.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect attached great importance to the disciples who had got the great achievement on the sword intent, so did Kenneth, the head of Cloud Sect. Because these disciples had unfathomable future potential, and Kenneth would recommend them to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>After this round of the competition, Kenneth was satisfied that he had found two disciples who had realized the consummation of the sword intent at the same time in battle. To the best of his knowledge, such a thing had never happened before.</p>

  <p>It could have been called a once in a lifetime experience.</p>

  <p>And to be honest, such a thing happening in the middle of the fight was even beyond the swordsmen's expectations, let alone Kenneth's.</p>

  <p>The superior abilities of the two guys were enviable. Some people were thinking that sometimes, life really was unfair.</p>

  <p>When someone had realized the consummation of the sword intent, they would enter a special state. This state had the power to shake both time and space and even bend reality itself.</p>

  <p>Not much was known about it. All Patrick knew was that sound and life vitality would dissipate when a cultivator realized the consummation of the sword intent, but he didn't understand the principle.</p>

  <p>As leader of Cloud Sect, Kenneth had broad and profound knowledge, so he knew the reason.</p>

  <p>The two swordsmen were so powerful that they had both entered into a special state of epiphany that accompanied the consummation of sword intent, especially when it happened at the same time. This state would cause a slight dislocation of space around them.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu cast a meaningful look at Kenneth and saw him in an ecstatic state. Kenneth laughed on his curious glance and told him, "I've found treasures."</p>

  <p>It seemed certain that Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming would pass the exam of Cloud Road, since they had reached the consummation of sword intent at the same time. There was enough in that to make Cloud Hall attach importance to them. And Kenneth was confident that Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming would both perform excellently on Cloud Road anyway.</p>

  <p>To be accurate, Kenneth's evaluation of them was not 'excellent' but 'good'. After all, the Cloud Road was not easy to pass through. He had to keep a margin in his evaluation.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming were on the ground, blissfully unaware of everything around them in a state of epiphany.</p>

  <p>Right now, the most important thing for them to do was to explore the sword intent and the mysteries that lay deep within it.</p>

  <p>There was no need to worry about winning the competition at the moment. Consolidating what they had just comprehended was the first task right now.</p>

  <p>However, not everyone was as knowledgeable as Patrick or Kenneth and therefore, most of the disciples couldn't understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are they doing?" "This is competition time. Are they really going to cultivate right now?"</p>

  <p>"Boo! This is so boring! They didn't fight much yet. There was just some sloppy fencing, and since then, they have been sitting on the ground motionless."</p>

  <p>"Is the competition over? Who won?" "They are wasting our time. Are they going to fight or not?"</p>

  <p>Just as the crowd's complaints were getting loud, Elder Xu flew over them and snapped in a low voice, "Shut up you all! Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming are cultivating in a state of epiphany. Don't disturb them! If anyone makes the least amount of noise after this warning, he is going to be expelled from Cloud Sect immediately!" he warned.</p>

  <p>Hearing the warning from Elder Xu, the disciples became instantly quiet and didn't even dare to breathe abnormally.</p>

  <p>Cloud Sect attached great importance to training talents and did not tolerate anyone disturbing those talents. They focused especially on the geniuses which stood out from the disciples.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the value of several geniuses, such as Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, Patrick and Tracy, were almost equal to the value of hundreds of thousands of ordinary disciples combined.</p>

  <p>Being a genius meant that one could stand out from the hundreds of thousands of disciples, while mediocrity would only remain unknown.</p>

  <p>Cloud Sect was very tolerant. Every disciple would get a variety of benefits and welfare as soon as they entered Cloud Sect. But Cloud Sect was cruel too. The resources it showered on the gifted were far apart from those it allowed the ordinary people to have. That was the system.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt that he was in a strange state. It was supposed to be dark and he should not have been able to see anything since his eyes were closed. But right now, he could see a mountain standing erectly in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was a mountain with swords struck on it everywhere, protruding like rocks here and there.</p>
