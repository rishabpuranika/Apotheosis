<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 707 Refining Acupoints (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Subsequently, after the red dragon lent him a hand in refining his body with the use of the primordial energy, his body went through a mind-blowing transformation. The moment he sprung up from the bed, there was a sensation rushing through his body, brimming with an unfamiliar force which seemed to be different from life vitality. He somehow knew there was something within him, but he just didn't know how to draw it out.</p>

  <p>That was the reason he accidentally hit the ceiling surprisingly when he jumped up.</p>

  <p>"It looks like you've managed to form your own forceful energy right on your very first body refining. The primordial energy is quite powerful in my opinion. Ha-ha," the voice of the red dragon appeared without a warning.</p>

  <p>"Did you just say 'forceful energy'?" Zheng's eyes were gleaming with anticipation.</p>

  <p>"Mm-hmm, this is what people commonly refer to as a martial art of body refining," the red dragon affirmed.</p>

  <p>The system of body refinement and that of life vitality refinement were two utterly contrasting fields of martial arts. The two might have started with body refining, but after the five realms of body refining, they would branch out much differently. With that in mind, the warriors of the life vitality system should logically begin training from the nature level, and then the Illuminating Soul Realm, and the Internal Elixir Realm after that, and eventually, they'd reach the Virtual Tribulation Realm and even much higher levels.</p>

  <p>That being said, after finishing their practice in the five realms of body refining, the warriors adopting the body refining system would have to begin the refinement of their 108 acupuncture points, or acupoints for short.</p>

  <p>The next step would then be to build an indestructible body, succeeded by the Eight Path Platforms, and then finally, the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>"The body refining system is truly an enormous training system, much more perfect as opposed to the life vitality refining system. If you're interested in improving your martial arts and refining your body at the same time, you would have to put in more work and train harder than every other warrior out there before you could accomplish anything. Given that you have already undergone body refining, by now, you should be well aware just how grueling this road could be," the red dragon mentioned carefully.</p>

  <p>"Well, I know that full well," Luo Zheng responded in a calm manner. Because this was the path he decided to take, there was no way in hell he'd ever hesitate to move forward no matter how hard it was.</p>

  <p>Noticing that Luo Zheng looked just the same as he usually was, the red dragon exclaimed, "That's great. I was a bit anxious that you might not be adamant enough before. If you could somehow pull off practicing martial arts and refining your body simultaneously, you'll have the potential of becoming a dominator in some field one day and end up producing wonderful accomplishments. From what I could tell, the warriors who practice martial arts and refine their bodies are significantly stronger than their peers, so much so that they could be beyond compare. I think you're more than prepared enough, so let's proceed. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"Proceed?" Zheng's eyelids quivered after he heard the red dragon's statement.</p>

  <p>"What I just did was refine your body. You could think of it as transforming life energy into life vitality when you are practicing the life vitality system.</p>

  <p>Now, I'm going to start refining your acupoints. Normally, the power of thunder and fire will have to be used for this purpose. You didn't put into practice the cultivation methods of thunder or fire system, but as luck would have it, you have been baptized by the laws, so you have the basic understanding of the first layer of the laws of fire and thunder. Nothing could be better than utilizing pure thunder and fire to refine acupuncture points," the red dragon explained.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing all of that, Luo Zheng came to realize that his body refining was just at an early stage, quite like the nature level of life vitality refining. He had just started to refine life vitality back when he entered the nature level.</p>

  <p>For that reason, he went back to the courtyard and sat cross-legged. A flame materialized right in front of him. The flame was rather small and seemed to possess insignificant power, but it was exceptionally pure, much like a dancing flame spirit.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a bolt of lightning also popped up in front of him. The lightning was sparkling with blue light, akin to that of the light of the flawless sapphire. And it was dancing as well.</p>

  <p>Under the guidance of the red dragon, the flame and the lightning bolt in front of Luo Zheng suddenly intertwined, darting toward his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>That was one of the main acupoints in the human body, the 20th point on the Governing Vessel.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body began quivering after the flame and lightning darted into his first acupoint. Then, beans of sweat began to form, streaming down from his forehead.</p>

  <p>The refining of acupoints was as painful as body refining, but, in contrast, body refining caused severe pain in every single part of the human body, while the pain of refining acupoints, on the other hand, was focused in just one point.</p>

  <p>The pure flame and lightning continued spreading on his eyebrows, making him feel as though his eyebrows were about to burst.</p>

  <p>The strength of his will had been put to the test at such a great extent at that moment. In spite of the fact that the flame and lightning came from his own understanding of the Fire Law and the Thunder Law, at that point in time, they were being refined in his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>It would spell trouble for him if he carelessly allowed them to slip into his mind, so he simply couldn't allow himself to lose focus.</p>
