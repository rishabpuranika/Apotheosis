  <p>The beast then pounced on Frank!</p>

  <p>It was three meters high, large, and bulky but quite agile. Flapping its wings, it swooped down upon Frank repeatedly.</p>

  <p>Despite being under attack by the fierce beast, Frank was still very calm.</p>

  <p>He continuously hit with his spear every time the beast struck at him.</p>

  <p>"Sky-breaking Thrust!"</p>

  <p>"Recurring Thrust!"</p>

  <p>"Circling Thrust!"</p>

  <p>Each time the spear lunged forward, it hit one of the beast's palms. After several thrusts, the palms of that violent beast were bleeding profusely.</p>

  <p>"Frank, go get it!"</p>

  <p>Shouted a woman who was standing on the side together with a group of people.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng and the other two hadn't met any female disciple in the Cloud Hall before, they assumed she was from the Iridescence Sect.</p>

  <p>"She is Lois Jin from the Iridescence Sect. I heard that she is engaged to Frank, so she must be Frank's fianc?e," Lewis came out to explain.</p>

  <p>'Smart guy.' Shaking his head, Luo Luo Zheng gave a smile. 'This Lewis does like gabbling and self-talking. Still, he is quite well-informed, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Being tall, slender, and otherworldly good-looking, Lois looked like a perfect match for Frank. The two seemed destined to be with each other.</p>

  <p>"Let's go to them. Seems that Frank's got enough strength to tackle that beast," Luo Luo Zheng suggested. Then, the three walked towards the group.</p>

  <p>At that point, Lois and her league happened to notice Luo Luo Zheng and his companions. They all looked astounded, apparently taken aback by the fact that there were more people who dared to enter the Death Road other than themselves.</p>

  <p>After observing the fight between Frank and the beast even for a while, Luo Luo Zheng thought that Frank had it all under control, so they simply decided to hit the road. However, something unexpected happened before they could go around the beast.</p>

  <p>As the fight continued, the beast suddenly let out a bellow before clapping its wings to draw a few steps back. The silver light around it slowly dimmed, but the next second, layers of golden scales started covering its body.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! This Flying Yaksha is going through a transfiguration. It'll become much stronger!" a Cloud Hall disciple behind Lois cried.</p>

  <p>Lois looked over her shoulder, casting a startled glance at the Cloud Hall disciple. Even Frank was bewildered as he heard that remark.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng and his companions just arrived here, they had no idea what was going on. They reckoned that the Cloud Hall disciple was a knowledgeable guy. Frank, however, was totally mystified by this fact.</p>

  <p>Frank had entered the Death Road along with four other people? Lois, Patrick, Brumous Sect's Zade, and a Cloud Hall disciple.</p>

  <p>Many Cloud Hall disciples had managed to get onto the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>They had even outnumbered the disciples of any other sects.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, with his remarkable memory, Frank could call everyone by their names.</p>

  <p>But he found himself unable to recognize the Cloud Hall disciple.</p>

  <p>It was absurd because that Cloud Hall disciple was not supposed to exist.</p>

  <p>However, he did encounter him on the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Frank also noticed that the Cloud Hall disciple was quite familiar with this Death Road. When everybody started considering giving it up because the Death Road of the Sea of Raging Fire was a dead end, it was the Cloud Hall disciple who urged them to hold on and assured them that the exit was right at the end of the road.</p>

  <p>Surely as he said, plenty of whirls appeared just as they reached the last stone on that dead-end road.</p>

  <p>After jumping into the whirls, the Cloud Hall disciple appeared to know the Death Road ahead of them as his own palms. He helped them avoid loads of dangerous spots before they barged into the nest of this Flying Yaksha by accident. And that was how they got the Flying Yaksha chasing them all the way here.</p>

  <p>None of them knew that the beast was called Flying Yaksha until the Cloud Hall disciple cried it out loud. Naturally, they started to have some doubts.</p>

  <p>'Who is this Cloud Hall disciple?' 'Why did he take the Death Road with us?' 'What's his game?' Frank was baffled by those questions.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea about those scruples Frank and Lois had. But as he saw the Flying Yaksha beginning its transfiguration, his face grew serious as well.</p>

  <p>'This Flying Yaksha was already pretty strong in its normal shape. If it completes the transfiguration and becomes more powerful, I bet no one can subdue it!'</p>

  <p>"Tianming, let's go to fight it together!" Luo Luo Zheng called out as he fished out the Blood Drinking Sword.</p>

  <p>Tianming also drew out the Blood-corroding Sword over his shoulder. He gazed at the golden Flying Yaksha in the air, his eyes as sharp as blades.</p>

  <p>"I don't need your help. If you strike, you'll just get in my way!" Frank said as he brandished the spear in his hand. Apparently, the arrival of Luo Luo Zheng and his companions would not be of any help for Frank. He believed they would be a drag on his team.</p>

  <p>After all, the three were fairly low-ranked? one was merely at the third grade of the nature level, one had just consummated the natural level, and the other one was at the first grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>They should have known better than to step onto the Death Road. Now that they did, they were just extra burdens for Frank.</p>

  <p>From his perspective, Lois and Patrick were the only two eligible to fight by his side. As to Zade Zhou from the Brumous Sect, he would have died a thousand times if not for Frank's protection.</p>

  <p>Frank was very confident about his strength, though he was rather arrogant. Since he had absolute power, he didn't mind taking care of a few more people.</p>

  <p>But if others wanted to butt in on his fight, they should first ask themselves if they had the same strength as him.</p>

  <p>And it was evident that Luo Luo Zheng did not have that kind of strength. Therefore, Frank chose to confront the transfigured Flying Yaksha on his own.</p>
