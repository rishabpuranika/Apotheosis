<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The man Ken Luo called the Blood Prisoner had appeared in C County and its neighborhoods.</p>

  <p>He had cultivated himself by a demonic method of eating the blood and flesh of living humans. There had been many people from the counties who went missing in the recent years.</p>

  <p>The missing people weren't noticed at first, until one day someone had accidentally entered the Blood Prisoner's cave. He found tons of human bones and soon enough, the truth was revealed to the public.</p>

  <p>After the case was reported to the superior level, Burning Sky Empire sent some professionals to arrest the Blood Prisoner. The Cloud Sect also offered a reward to anyone who would capture him, so many elite disciples participated in the search after they had accepted the task.</p>

  <p>Although the Blood Prisoner was quite strong, he didn't stand against so many high-level people. Therefore he was badly hurt and escaped to any place he could find.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Perrin Luo was just dismissed by the Cloud Sect and sent back to the Luo Clan. He told Bryson Luo that Zheng had a great leap in progress and had already entered the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>When Bryson knew that Zheng was still alive and had been a disciple of the Cloud Sect, he suffered a serious illness. He and Zheng were sworn enemies. The Cloud Sect seemed to be the perfect place to cultivate a warrior. When Zheng reached a high level after five or ten years, he would surely come back. What would Bryson do when that time came?</p>

  <p>He felt greatly pressured. Whenever he thought about Zheng, he couldn't fall asleep for the whole night.</p>

  <p>Thus, after Bryson recovered, he continuously improved his strength because of the pressure he felt.</p>

  <p>Not only did he become a nature creature, but he also reached as high as the third level.</p>

  <p>It was known that as a warrior grew older, his bones would toughen and it would be harder for him to improve greatly. The fact that Bryson's achievement of such a high level was all because of Zheng.</p>

  <p>But even though Bryson achieved such a feat, he didn't feel satisfied.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect was too strong, as seen from Perrin's experience. Perrin improved greatly and had grown into a nature creature in a short time because he got a little help from one of the noble clans, the Wang Clan.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had enough time to grow, Bryson still wouldn't be able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>When Bryson was at a loss on what to do, he met up with the Blood Prisoner, who was on the run from government arrest.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner was undoubtedly powerful. He had to escape to random places because of his injuries. In the end, he hid himself in the cellar of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Bryson hadn't found the Blood Prisoner in the cellar at first as he was really good at hiding himself. However, after several people were reported missing, Bryson realized that something was up.</p>

  <p>Now, the news about the Blood Prisoner had become sensational. Soon enough, Bryson deduced that the Blood Prisoner had hidden in the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't try to arrest the Blood Prisoner as the others did.</p>

  <p>Instead, he covered the truth about the missing people, and now only he and Ken in the Luo Clan knew the truth.</p>

  <p>Ken didn't report the facts to the local government. He found the Blood Prisoner by himself and offered to help the Prisoner— not only would he help the Blood Prisoner, but also give the Blood Prisoner living people to eat!</p>

  <p>Those servants and members that had doubts about the missing people in Luo Clan were sent to the Blood Prisoner by Ken himself.</p>

  <p>For a long time after that, Bryson occasionally abducted one or two men and threw them in the Blood Prisoner's cell. They helped the Blood Prisoner regain his strength by offering live people he could eat.</p>

  <p>At first, Bryson gave the Blood Prisoner the slaves, the death row. Later on, there weren't enough slaves anymore, so Bryson and Ken looked for people from the outside and abducted them.</p>

  <p>That was also why Melvin became a human punchbag because there were fewer slaves left in the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>The reason Bryson chose to do those was mainly because of Zheng. He thought that Zheng would come back sooner or later. If he kept the Blood Prisoner in the Luo Clan, he felt that the Blood Prisoner would surely defeat Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect that Zheng would come back so soon. It had been only a year since Zheng left. Even though Zheng could improve himself considerably, how strong could he be in such a short time?</p>

  <p>Thus, Bryson thought that he could defeat Zheng by himself since he was also strong enough now.</p>

  <p>But just to be sure, he still asked Ken to tell the Blood Prisoner that Zheng had shown up. The Blood Prisoner hadn't completely recovered yet as his current strength was only 70 percent of his best, so there was a huge difference. After all, Bryson didn't have any magic pills for him and only offered him some live people.</p>

  <p>'However, the current Blood Prisoner must be strong enough to defeat Zheng, ' Bryson thought.</p>

  <p>He then went out of his room and jumped on the roofs of the Luo Clan property like a dragonfly that skimmed on the water's surface. He rushed quickly towards the Martial Arts Hall.</p>

  <p>When he entered the Martial Arts hall, he saw that the members of Luo Clan were gathered around Zheng. More members were still coming and joined them as well. Most of them were young ones from the fourth and fifth branches, but there were also many members from the second and third branches.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng stood in the center. He was dressed in a cyan gown and had a gleaming sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo!" Bryson shouted.</p>

  <p>"You unfilial child who betrayed the Luo Clan! You actually have the guts to come back?!" Bryson wanted to steal the spotlight first so he yelled arrogantly. Then at the same time, he took out his thirteen swords.</p>

  <p>The swords were covered by purple life vitality and glimmered a violet hue.</p>

  <p>"The Luo Clan is my home. Why won't I come back?" Zheng said and looked up.</p>

  <p>There were no signs of fear on his calm face.</p>

  <p>The members of Luo Clan had been oppressed by Bryson for a long time, so all of them chose to side with Zheng and regarded him as the new master. However, they were still nervous in the face of a high spirit like Bryson's.</p>

  <p>Bryson had been the master of the Luo Clan for many years and had imposed his authority on the young people for a long time. Although the members were confident in Zheng, they were still worried. If Bryson defeated Zheng, they could only imagine what he would do to them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, many members moved away from Zheng a bit under the pressure of Bryson's presence.</p>

  <p>This way, at least they would have a mutual position if Zheng failed!</p>

  <p>"Zheng is the new master of the Luo Clan. Why can't he come back?"</p>

  <p>Tristan exclaimed. When Melvin heard him, he also felt emboldened to say something.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Zheng is Mike Luo's son. It is natural that the son should inherit his father's position. Why can't Zheng come back?" he said. Then he added, "But you, Bryson Luo, you did drastic things and made Luo Clan decline!"</p>

  <p>"You are actually the unfilial child of the Luo Clan!" he declared lastly.</p>

  <p>The other members began to shout together too.</p>

  <p>Those who had hesitated just now changed their minds and soon joined the group to shout as well.</p>

  <p>During his reign, Bryson allowed some people to commit violations, including Grey. They were also unfair in distributing resources. Thus, many of them did not want to support Bryson anymore.</p>

  <p>When Bryson saw how the young members acted, he coldly said, "Do you all want to betray the Luo Clan?"</p>

  <p>"We are not betraying the Luo Clan!</p>

  <p>We are betraying you, Bryson Luo! The Luo Clan does not belong to you alone. It belongs to all of us!</p>

  <p>But you're different, Bryson! You think that you own it!" Tristan shout back.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Bryson exclaimed in rage.</p>

  <p>At this point, Bryson had snapped. His eyes glinted with killing intent and one of his thirteen swords shot towards Tristan at once.</p>

  <p>The members felt nervous when they saw what Bryson had done. After all, none of them could fight against him.</p>

  <p>The sword was so quick that before anyone could do something, it arrived in front of Tristan.</p>

  <p>"Ping! Ping!"</p>

  <p>Two sharp sounds followed and the sword was cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his Streamer Sword and looked up at Bryson. "Is that how you treat the people of the Luo Clan? In your eyes, they should be at your mercy. You can do whatever you want to them. Is there any difference between your family member and an animal in your eyes?" he asked icily.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is right. Once I did something that didn't please you, you wanted to kill me. What do you think we are?</p>

  <p>Bryson, we have the same family name and we are related. Do you still remember that?" Tristan asked as well.</p>

  <p>He felt that he had nothing to lose now, but what he could do was to believe Zheng and trust Zheng's strength!</p>

  <p>Just now, he was right. Zheng could protect him from Bryson's attacks.</p>

  <p>Thus, Tristan said those words fearlessly. He was a young man with low status, but he actually blamed Bryson face to face. This was beyond his imagination until Zheng came.</p>

  <p>Bryson didn't respond to Tristan, but he stared at the Steamer Sword in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The thirteen swords were all middle-grade mysterious weapons!</p>

  <p>It had cost Bryson a lot and a long time just to own the thirteen swords.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's sword had cut one of his thirteen swords in a mere second! Zheng's gleaming sword immediately caught his attention.</p>

  <p>'It sliced my weapon so easily as if it has cut a vegetable!</p>

  <p>What level is that sword? Is it a top-grade mysterious weapon? Or is it a low-grade spiritual weapon?</p>

  <p>A middle-grade spiritual weapon, perhaps?' Bryson could not help but wonder.</p>

  <p>However, Bryson had never expected that Zheng's sword was a fairy weapon. He had never imagined it!</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had never seen a top-grade spiritual weapon in his life, not to mention a fairy weapon.</p>
