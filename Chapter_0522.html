  <p>Regretfully, she had been put under house arrest inside the Shine Hall and couldn't receive any news of the outside world. As a result, she could only guess and infer in her mind whenever she thought about how well Luo Luo Zheng would be able to perform in the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>But upon hearing her question, Luo Luo Zheng had immediately replied to her that he had won the first place. Although he had responded in a low voice, Mu Ning felt as if a streak of lightning had flashed across her brain and hit her. It was evident how sensational that piece of news was for her.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was sure that it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to lie to her, but the news was really unbelievable, since she hadn't seen the announcement made by the Cloud Sect, and hadn't personally looked at the list of rankings released by the Cloud Sect or witnessed the fight.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strengths seemed to have been improved and reached the third grade of nature level. Mu Ning could easily detect all these improvements and changes in Luo Luo Zheng. But what if Luo Luo Zheng had reached the third grade of nature level? How could he have battled with the top disciples of all thirty three peaks? How could he have fought and won the disciples who had directly learned skills from elders and saints?</p>

  <p>In spite of her great doubt, Mu Ning could do nothing but believe in the news. Only when she believed could she understand why Ray had put forward such a condition to set her free.</p>

  <p>Thinking from Ray's standpoint, Mu Ning confirmed that she would surely make the same choice as Ray had if Luo Luo Zheng had really won the first place among all disciples of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng's words had been proven true by what Ray had stated.</p>

  <p>When she had been feeling rather bored in the Shine Hall, Mu Ning had calculated that perhaps Luo Luo Zheng would have been able to climb onto the list of top 100 contestants. But which place could he exactly win? Top 90?</p>

  <p>Or top 80? Mu Ning was even not sure how many times she had made guesses about that. Now, she had realized that she had never guessed right.</p>

  <p>'Is Luo Zheng's great achievement in the All Peaks Competition enough for arousing great concerns of Kenneth Shi?</p>

  <p>Can Luo Luo Zheng take me away from here since he has come to the Burning Sky Palace?'</p>

  <p>As Mu Ning was overwrought by different questions, her heart was beating very fast. She could even hear her own heartbeat.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Luo Luo Zheng turned around towards Ray and replied, "Your Highness, I have already told you very clearly that I will not take any sides in this battle!"</p>

  <p>Ray seemed to have expected this answer from Luo Zheng's mouth and questioned calmly in response, "Then,  Luo Luo Zheng Luo, do you think that you can take the princess away without giving anything in return?"</p>

  <p>As if Luo Luo Zheng had discerned the threats in Ray's words, he unsheathed his long Streamer Sword. "Shiiiiing". The sound of Luo Zheng's sword being drawn from a sheath was heard clearly across the hall. Then, he declared sternly, "I never thought of taking Mu Ning away without a fight. Since your highness seems to consider that I won't be able to make it, I would like to prove it!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that Luo Luo Zheng was calling her name so intimately, Mu Ning throbbed a little and some unusual feelings crept into her mind. 'Didn't this guy always call me Master Su? Now, why is he calling me by my name directly?' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng carried his sword in one hand, walked over towards Mu Ning and took her by her hand. Then, he said, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>It would have been rather offensive to directly hold the princess' hand, but for some reason, Mu Ning didn't seem to have any aversion towards it.</p>

  <p>Instead, she followed closely behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But when they had just taken two steps, an old man stopped them near the entrance of the Feathery Star Hall. This old man was not tall, but his nose was sharp and aquiline. He looked deadly ferocious, and some domineering pressure could be felt from his very posture.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, I really admire you. But my admiration can't be the excuse for you to look down upon me. You were able to challenge masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm dependent upon your strengths as a nature creature. And today, all those guests present in this banquet are no match for you. In spite of this, do you think that you can take her away safely?"</p>

  <p>Ray said, spreading out his hands.</p>

  <p>"Ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, his eyebrows knitting as he stared at the old man.</p>

  <p>Standing at the entrance emotionless like a robot, the old man was still blocking their way. He was a master at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, so even other masters present in the great hall had a strong sense of oppression from him even though he was just standing there. It was almost as if he could kill them just by his looks. As this old man firmly gazed at him, Luo Luo Zheng felt beads of sweat transpiring on his back.</p>

  <p>It had been a long period of time since he felt such a strong sense of oppression last time.</p>

  <p>"Ray, do you dare to try and kill me?" Luo Luo Zheng asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Ray shook his head very calmly and responded, "To be honest, I do not.</p>

  <p>Now, you are ranked Number One in Cloud Sect. How would I be able to explain it to Kenneth if I kill you?"</p>

  <p>"Since you dare not, then why do you... try to stop me today?" As Luo Luo Zheng was saying that, he turned back and moved forward with a flick of his sword. Immediately, the energy of the Phoenix Crystal on his right arm fully emancipated by itself. In the meantime, all dragon scales inside his body lit up, as he had almost exerted all his strengths!</p>

  <p>Evan hadn't stepped into the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm yet, but Luo Luo Zheng had been only capable of battling him in terms of sword play. Although this old man's gift and even his foundation were not as awesome as Evan's, he was not weak. Luo Luo Zheng significantly lagged behind this old man in terms of cultivation levels.</p>

  <p>To confront with such a strong master, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to adopt his mightiest tactic.</p>
