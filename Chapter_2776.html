<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2776 A Cold Voice </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Gallio had been preoccupied with a lot of thoughts.</p>

  <p>Once the big fiends died, they would lose all the Faith Energy they had gathered. Gallio had first-hand experience about losing everything by now.</p>

  <p>Knowing he had prestige in the past, those damn little fiends were still respectful to Gallio.</p>

  <p>Unsure if it was worth it, Gallio had been left with no choice but to gamble on it.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, losing his strength made him feel humiliation.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Hitting the door with his fist, Gallio broke it open.</p>

  <p>The loud noise from the door was enough to call everyone's attention. Stuart and the other two big fiends in the hall immediately turned and found Gallio standing by the door.</p>

  <p>As they saw that Gallio had become much smaller than before, the muscles on their faces twitched and they burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>"What a strange scene to behold! You have become so small!"</p>

  <p>The room roared as everyone started laughing at the sight of Gallio.</p>

  <p>Hiding in the corner, the little fiends also let out a shrill laughter.</p>

  <p>"How could Master Gallio become so small?"</p>

  <p>"But he is still bigger than us!"</p>

  <p>"In size, but in terms of strength, he must be very weak, right?"</p>

  <p>Those little fiends danced around the room. Unlike other fiends, they were vicious creatures refined by the fiend race through some special methods.</p>

  <p>They never relied on the Faith Energy to survive.</p>

  <p>Therefore, their strength would not be weakened even after they got killed by Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Pride sighed, flashing above Gallio's head.</p>

  <p>Even though Gallio was now only more than a hundred feet high, he was still a colossal sight to these dwarf-like fiends.</p>

  <p>However, in terms of strength, Pride was clearly more powerful than him now.</p>

  <p>Gallio used to bully these seven little fiends in the past. So now that he became much smaller and weaker, they naturally made reprisals.</p>

  <p>"Master Gallio, it appears that you've become sluggish,"</p>

  <p>Pride teased from above.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the other fiends also flew over and stood on Gallio's head.</p>

  <p>"Get off me!" Gallio roared, wearing a long face.</p>

  <p>"Haha, you are so weak now," another fiend exclaimed. "You no longer have the right to order us."</p>

  <p>These little fiends were so dexterous that even the Holy Beings needed to use their spiritual senses to capture them. With Gallio's current status, he could do nothing to them.</p>

  <p>Hearing the fiend's teasing words, Gallio became furious. "You damn guys!</p>

  <p>You are courting your death!"</p>

  <p>Although Gallio was already fuming mad, the little fiends still did not restrain at all. They used to be afraid of the strong and powerful Gallio in the past, but after he got weaker, they realized he was no match for them now.</p>

  <p>"Leave him alone!"</p>

  <p>Stretching out his arms from beside the round table, Stuart gently waved towards Gallio's head.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>With Stuart's flick, the little fiends shot like sharp arrows and fell on the wall on the side of the hall.</p>

  <p>Gallio jumped up and stood on his chair.</p>

  <p>He was too small to sit on that huge chair now. He could only lean against the back of the chair and warned, "It's your turn!"</p>

  <p>Seeing how Gallio ended up, both Stuart and the other two big fiends had a subtle change in their expressions.</p>

  <p>They all knew that in the Abyss Demon Region, strength meant everything.</p>

  <p>The strongest could eat everything and obtain everything they wanted. This was the same reason why the four of them stood at the top of the food chain.</p>

  <p>Suddenly falling from the top of the pyramid, Gallio felt a sharp pain in his heart.</p>

  <p>"In order to leave the Abyss Demon Region, isn't it too much for us to pay such a price?" A hint of sadness reflected in Stuart's eyes.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Do you want to go back on your words?" Gallio asked, his face showing a touch of sternness.</p>

  <p>If the other three big fiends changed their minds, there was nothing that Gallio could do.</p>

  <p>Though he was still one of the four big fiends, his identity fell short of the reality after he lost his strength.</p>

  <p>"Actually, it's not bad to maintain the old order," answered another big fiend. "At the very least, we have plenty to eat and drink in the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>"Can you ward off the Holy Beings?" Gallio howled. He was expecting they would say that.</p>

  <p>"We can sit down and have a nice talk," Stuart said with a smile, but that did not come out funny.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The sound came off as Gallio punched the big livid round table.</p>

  <p>Given his current strength, Gallio could only make a small crack on the big table, making him feel quite powerless. At the same time, he felt that all the fiends had betrayed him.</p>

  <p>If only Stuart had said that earlier, he wouldn't have used the "Demonic Crystal Explosion" to explode himself.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, Master Gallio is angry."</p>

  <p>"Look at him. He looks like a clown!"</p>

  <p>"It's useless to get angry if you're weak."</p>

  <p>Gallio could hear how all those little fiends talked in a voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>

  <p>After releasing his anger on the table, Gallio calmed down. He smiled at Stuart and the others before he said, "But don't forget, when we chose to take a risk, we agreed to cooperate with that woman. Do you think she will let it go easily?"</p>

  <p>As the three big fiends realized what Gallio meant, a trace of fear initially registered on their faces.</p>

  <p>"We can go back on our words," one of the big fiends answered calmly.</p>

  <p>His name was Azazel. In terms of strength, Azazel was a bit stronger than Stuart and used to come next to Gallio, before Gallio lost his strength.</p>

  <p>"Right." Stuart nodded. "Anyway, that woman can only live in the Sea of Meditation. How powerful can she be if she can't even prove her existence?"</p>

  <p>In the Sea of Meditation, there were a lot of those domineering unknown creatures. The fiends did not dare to provoke them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the fiends had always been the masters of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Azazel's and Stuart's words made Gallio's heart sink.</p>

  <p>This meant that his sacrifice would be meaningless. He would probably even lose his chair at the round table.</p>

  <p>"That's unfair!" Gallio shouted, his voice sounding a little hoarse.</p>

  <p>"Is there any fairness in our race? Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Hearing Stuart's question, Gallio was rendered speechless. Everyone in the room burst into laughter, including the little fiends on the wall, filling the hall with joy.</p>

  <p>However, the next moment, the crowd stopped laughing.</p>

  <p>A unique feeling spread through the hall.</p>

  <p>As a wave of extreme fear started grabbing their hearts, even those little fiends on the wall became uneasy.</p>

  <p>This familiar feeling could only exist in the Sea of Meditation. But now, they actually felt it in the hall!</p>

  <p>"It's indeed unfair. Since you have chosen to cooperate with me, I won't give you a chance to back out now."</p>

  <p>A cold female voice came from the middle of the round table, calling everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>The smooth surface of the round table began to freeze. While the milky white frosty air continued to spread, many beautiful rectangular ice crystals formed on the table.</p>

  <p>Soon, the temperature of the hall dropped sharply, making it like an extremely cold ice cellar.</p>
