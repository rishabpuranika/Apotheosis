<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2498 The Creatures In The Sun </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The whirlpool propelled Luo Zheng upwards at incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole process, Luo Zheng stood precariously balanced on the flying sword, trying to remain standing as his hands tightly gripped the Sun-resisting Umbrella.</p>

  <p>"The speed is too great!"</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng's speed had far exceeded his flying speed, even when he tried his best. The whirlpool thrust him all the way upwards to the sun above.</p>

  <p>The momentum built up for about five minutes as he was continually pushed higher into the air.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>In the raging sea of fire above his head, a huge flame wave was triggered and swept down towards him.</p>

  <p>"I've finally arrived."</p>

  <p>The Sun Essence Flames on the outermost and middle layers were merely the flames that left the sun's internal body.</p>

  <p>The sea of fire above Luo Zheng was the innermost layer of the sun.</p>

  <p>There was no time for Luo Zheng to think or even adjust his position to get a better stance on the flying sword. Holding the Sun-resisting Umbrella over his head, he plunged with tremendous force into the sea of fire.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes, he saw that everything around him was crimson colored, as if he was inside a crimson sea.</p>

  <p>The burning whirlpool couldn't resist the sea of fire, and gradually it was absorbed into the flames, until it became smaller and smaller, finally dissipating completely.</p>

  <p>"The internal area of the sun is vast. I don't know where the hall that Harper mentioned is, so all I can do is slowly look for it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng selected a direction at random and commanded the flying sword to slowly move ahead.</p>

  <p>There was no magma in the sea of fire, but a kind of purplish red heat current ebbed and flowed like tides of the ocean. The heat current was very thick, almost becoming a burning liquid. It was probably the liquefied form of the Sun Essence Flames.</p>

  <p>The energy contained in it was mind boggling. After all, even if the Holy Beings were to touch it, they would instantly perish!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued to steer the flying sword across the fire sea, it was proving difficult for him to increase his speed.</p>

  <p>He could only slowly fly while looking around.</p>

  <p>He was probably only the second person to ever visit here, besides the captain of the ship.</p>

  <p>In such a terrible environment, there could exist no other creatures. This was some relief to him at least, as he did not relish having to fight in such a hostile environment.</p>

  <p>"Keep moving up!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't delay or dilly dally.</p>

  <p>Two hours had already passed.</p>

  <p>Four hours had now passed.</p>

  <p>Finally, six hours had passed, and still his search revealed nothing!</p>

  <p>He steered across the sea of fire for more than six hours in a row.</p>

  <p>But all that he could see was an endless red sea of fire, and the heat shimmering vistas did not change at all.</p>

  <p>Although the Sun-resisting Umbrella was quite capable of isolating him from all the flames outside, Luo Zheng felt bored already, and he even grew a little impatient as he had never before had to stay in such a boring place for such a long time.</p>

  <p>"This fireball is probably the size of a full region. It will take several years for me to locate that hall at my current slow speed."</p>

  <p>As he was hesitating, suddenly, an approaching sound could be heard closing in from behind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was startled as he turned around.</p>

  <p>Outside the protective light curtain formed by the Sun-resisting Umbrella, a swarm of fist sized shapes were gathering together.</p>

  <p>Under such high temperatures, he had been unable to release his spiritual sense, for once his spiritual sense left the light curtain, it would have been incinerated to ashes by the high temperatures raging beyond the light curtain. So Luo Zheng had not noticed that these small objects were approaching.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are they? How can they survive in such a hellish environment?" Astonishment was etched all over Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Everything, not to mention the Holy Beings, would be instantly cremated should they enter the sun. Ordinary fierce beasts and any other creatures would be destroyed here in the sun. What could these shapes be?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had never even considered that there could be creatures existing here in the sun.</p>

  <p>These fist sized objects appeared to be creatures with oval heads, and their left arms ended in large pincers. They each looked like an absurdly twisted kind of shrimp.</p>

  <p>Despite being funny looking, they didn't seem at all afraid of the burning Sun Essence Flames.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng did not dare to open the light curtain. Otherwise, he would really have wanted to reach through and grab a few of the strange shrimps and take them back with him.</p>

  <p>The shells of these beasts, which could clearly resist the Sun Essence Flames must be made of incredibly hardy materials and would be quite rare.</p>

  <p>But then again, considering that the shrimps were happily living here in the sea of fire, their temperature might be equal to that of the Sun Essence Flames. Even if Luo Zheng could catch them, he might lose a hand in the process of trying to touch them.</p>

  <p>Following after Luo Zheng, the little shrimps snapped at the light curtain again and again with their pincers.</p>

  <p>"Thump! Thump! Thump!"</p>

  <p>"These little creatures want to pierce through the light curtain and come inside?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned, as he realized this might not be the best idea.</p>

  <p>If the light curtain was interrupted, he would be instantly burned into ashes and disappear forever.</p>

  <p>"Go away! Shoo!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slapped against the light curtain, trying to dissuade his tiny pursuers.</p>

  <p>"Thump!"</p>

  <p>The light curtain vibrated heavily, and the strange shrimps scattered, but soon they rushed forward again and stuck to the light curtain with fierce determination as they punched the light curtain with their pincers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to drive the shrimps away a few times, but the shrimps soon discovered that Luo Zheng could only intimidate them, so they stopped fleeing.</p>

  <p>The number of these shrimps that gathered around Luo Zheng had increased, and now there was a whole swarm thumping at the light curtain.</p>

  <p>"This is troublesome."</p>

  <p>A wry smile momentarily flashed on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the light curtain formed by the Sun-resisting Umbrella was covered by about four hundred shrimps, almost completely obscuring Luo Zheng's view ahead.</p>

  <p>The strange shrimps were not powerful enough to break the light curtain, and therefore they didn't really pose a threat. However, Luo Zheng had already been moving slowly in the sun. Now his speed had slowed to a snail's pace due to the cumbersome shrimps.</p>

  <p>Feeling annoyed, Luo Zheng suddenly shook the Sun-resisting Umbrella again.</p>

  <p>The light curtain shook and bounced some shrimps off, but they didn't fear this and simply rose from the heat currents to stick to the curtain once more.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was now becoming even more worried.</p>

  <p>Just as he felt a sense of despair, through the gap between these strange shrimp bodies, he suddenly saw thin shadows darting towards him at incredible speeds.</p>

  <p>"Fish? Fish are coming!"</p>

  <p>Huge fish of six or seven feet long dashed towards him, their bodies curving as they swam.</p>

  <p>These fish were almost an adult's height, and they soon began circling around Luo Zheng. They opened their mouths and grabbed the strange shrimps, swallowing them in one gulp.</p>

  <p>"These strange shrimps are food for the fish." Luo Zheng was stunned to witness this weird drama.</p>

  <p>It seemed that there were more than just these two kinds of creatures living in the sea of fire. At least it appeared to form a complete food chain!</p>

  <p>The big fish had an excellent appetite. Soon, they had devoured all the shrimps that had been attached to the light curtain.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because they were now interested in Luo Zheng that they didn't leave. Like the shrimps, they began to use their sharp mouths to bite the light curtain.</p>

  <p>But soon, Luo Zheng suddenly became aware that the light above him had darkened.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the big fish gathered around the light curtain all swished their tails and fled in all directions.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng raised his head, he was confronted with the view of a gigantic whale, which was a few hundred thousand feet long arching above his head!</p>

  <p>There were two dark green flames burning in the gigantic whale's eyes, and faint flames were spawning all over the outer layer of its skin.</p>

  <p>As soon as the gigantic whale arrived, it opened its cavernous maw and swallowed the big fish whole.</p>

  <p>The fish within an area of thousands of feet were sucked into its mouth with a maelstrom of force.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also within this area, and he was unable to escape. He felt a huge gravitational force passing through, and he was instantly being sucked into the body of the whale together with the big fish. Together, they sank into the darkness within the whale.</p>
