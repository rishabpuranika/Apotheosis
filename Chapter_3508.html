<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Both of them were baffled by the sight of this iron plate.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Elvinia asked, blinking.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted at it. "Let's take a closer look."</p>

  <p>The thunder wings on his back flapped as the two of them approached the iron plate. Zheng reached out to touch it, his fingers grazing the cold surface.</p>

  <p>Elvinia touched it curiously. "What is this made of? It isn't eroded by all this energy at all."</p>

  <p>After a moment's thought, Zheng drew out a great amount of force from his inner world and directed it at the plate.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The impact caused a loud sound, but the solid iron plate did not move at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Whatever material this plate was made of, it seemed impossible for them to move it. They needed to get through this energy vortex, but this plate was proving to be an obstacle.</p>

  <p>"Let's try going above it." Zheng raised his head, fixing his gaze upwards.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Another lightning bolt flashed toward the space above them. Zheng pulled down another energy band.</p>

  <p>The two of them moved upwards little by little along the iron plate. After more than two hundred feet up, they had yet to see where it ended. This plate apparently went much higher than Zheng had imagined.</p>

  <p>Elvinia blinked. "Let's move to the left!"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>They continued moving, but now to the left side. This time, they reached the end after a short distance of less than thirty feet. The iron plate bent at a sharp right angle in this area.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw this, his eyes lit up. "It's not an iron plate! This looks like a..."</p>

  <p>"A house?" There was a confused look in Elvinia's eyes.</p>

  <p>They obviously had the same thought in mind.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that there would be an iron house in this energy vortex?</p>

  <p>Driven by curiosity, Zheng moved forward, following the newly discovered side. The wall was still made of the same iron material along the way, but after more than a hundred feet, he finally saw a small door.</p>

  <p>The door was only two feet wide, about the same size as a fox hole. There were extremely complicated Sanskrit words engraved on it.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to open the door by brute force. The iron material was quite strong.</p>

  <p>As Zheng gently pressed on the Sanskrit words, one of the words lit up.</p>

  <p>Intrigued, Elvinia followed suit. Every time she pressed, one word would light up. After a few more presses, all of the Sanskrit words had been lit up.</p>

  <p>However, the illumination soon faded away.</p>

  <p>"It seems the words should be pressed in a certain order to open the door,"</p>

  <p>Elvinia mused out loud. "Unfortunately, it would be difficult to guess what that order could be."</p>

  <p>"If we know the meaning of the Sanskrit words, we may be able to solve it,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Elvinia raised a brow. She did remember that Zheng seemed to have some expertise in deciphering Sanskrit words, since he was able to interpret the Truth Enlightenment correctly before.</p>

  <p>However, what Elvinia did not know was that it was not Zheng who deciphered the Sanskrit words, but Geoffrey in his inner world.</p>

  <p>All this time, the Regal Jade Spirit had been hiding in Zheng's inner world, completely clueless of what was happening outside, which was why when Zheng summoned the spirit, he was shocked to see where they were. "Zheng, where are you now?"</p>

  <p>"I am on the way to Stage Fourteen," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>At these words, the Regal Jade Spirit fell silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>The entire Regal Jade Civilization had withdrawn from the Desire World.</p>

  <p>He definitely knew about this vortex.</p>

  <p>"What is it with this iron house? How can it not erode in the energy vortex?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked, staring agog at the iron gate.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but I want to take a look inside. Please ask Geoffrey to decipher the Sanskrit words," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit's curiosity was also piqued now, so he was only too glad to cooperate.</p>

  <p>Zheng waited for about five minutes before the Regal Jade Spirit relayed Geoffrey's response. "Your son said that you have to press the third word on the left, then the sixth on the right, and then the last one..."</p>

  <p>As the spirit spoke, Zheng pressed the Sanskrit words on the door one by one.</p>

  <p>When he pressed a word, it lit up, giving off a bright light.</p>

  <p>After Zheng pressed twelve of the words as directed, a circle of Sanskrit words began to emit green light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As the green light flashed on the door, a loud click also sounded. The door had opened!</p>

  <p>"It worked!"</p>

  <p>A grin spread on Elvinia's face.</p>

  <p>"Go on! Get in!" the Regal Jade Spirit urged.</p>

  <p>Zheng opened the small door, supported Elvinia's body, and pushed her inside slowly. Then he went in after her.</p>

  <p>The door was not big. It was obviously not designed for a human being.</p>

  <p>After squeezing his way through the door, Zheng raised his head and looked around. The interior wasn't small. Both he and Elvinia were able to stand upright once inside.</p>

  <p>The two looked around the house, eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>The space inside was divided into two parts: one light, and one dark. The area near the door was illuminated and was empty, while the other area was pitch black. No one could see what was in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Is that half of the space already in the Dark Region?" Zheng said, staring at the darkness ahead.</p>

  <p>"I think so," Elvinia said, nodding. As a purified being, she was very sensitive to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>As they got closer to the darkness, a shrill scream rang out.</p>

  <p>The voice sounded extremely forlorn. When it reached their ears, it felt like countless needles had been stuck in their souls.</p>

  <p>Struggling through the pain, anger crossing her features, Elvinia raised her right hand and snapped, "Great Sanskrit Light!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A white light so bright one couldn't stare at it directly shot toward the dark.</p>

  <p>As it did, Zheng clearly saw a row of iron cages hanging along the walls in the dark. The cages contained strange types of monsters.</p>

  <p>The iron cage right in front of them contained a monster with a head like an owl's and a body like a leopard's, covered with dozens of thorny tentacles.</p>

  <p>As it screamed, it was enveloped in the Great Sanskrit Light. Under the glare of the snow-white light, its body quickly began to melt. First its fur, then its flesh, its blood, and finally its bones.</p>

  <p>Elvinia showed no mercy and didn't stop the Great Sanskrit Light until the monster was completely melted.</p>

  <p>Her chest heaved up and down. It took her a while to calm down.</p>

  <p>Obviously, she had been frightened.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this iron house?" Zheng looked at the darkness and frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"No matter what this is, we should probably kill all the monsters in the cages," Elvinia said coldly.</p>

  <p>She raised a finger. The bright light gathered around her hand once again.</p>
