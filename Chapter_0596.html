<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 596 An Exchange Of Favors (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Runes took many forms and could be used for different things. For example, a magic-array expert was a special type of runic experts in the Eastern Region. A large array was usually made of hundreds or thousands of runes, and it required special runes to build magic arrays.</p>

  <p>Runes could also be used in refining weapons. For example, if a weapon refiner could use some special runes while refining a weapon, it could increase the success rate of the refinement and the weapon's grade would also improve. The same process was used for refining pills.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the cyan dragon's offer, Luo Zheng could not help but smile. It could be recalled that he had earned his money mostly by selling his heavenly essence. He had thought about becoming a weapon refiner by right of his heavenly essence but had only learned the way of smelting.</p>

  <p>He hadn't even once tried the most important part of refining a weapon.</p>

  <p>But if the cyan dragon could teach him the method of using runes, it would be much easier for Luo Zheng to master weapon refining.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating, he immediately answered, "Hey, I like that idea!</p>

  <p>That's exactly what I have in mind right now. If you can really teach me, you can absorb as much flood dragon blood as you want. As for me, I've absorbed what I needed, so it's useless for me now."</p>

  <p>"You're a tricky bastard!" The cyan dragon felt annoyed but had to accept that he was tricked by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the herbal garden, Tia was patiently counting and recording all the herbs. Each herb required a specific method of handling, otherwise, they would immediately wither once touched. For example, the rhizome herb called Nurturing Primrose would produce the sound of a crying baby when casually touched, then eventually withered in one breath and lost its value. The Fiery Dragon Saliva, on the other hand, contained a fiery toxin that would infect people when they touched the plant.</p>

  <p>Hence, Tia dealt with all the herbs accordingly. As she was carefully dealing with the herbs, the thought of Luo Zheng bathing in the pond came to her mind. She blushed momentarily but shrugged the indecent thought off her mind. She focused on the idea on her mind that some herbs in the garden could be added to the flood dragon blood that would purify Zheng's life vitality and refresh his body.</p>

  <p>Though she envied Zheng's current status, she wasn't a stingy person. She believed that Luo Zheng held great potential for the Cloud Hall. She wouldn't want to waste such a great talent. As she had seen it, Luo Zheng could muster a sword spirit that had a real shape when he was still in a low refining level. And that proved that he could be a promising talent to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>With excitement, she dug up those herbs and headed towards the blood pond. She couldn't keep her mind off the thought of seeing Luo Zheng half naked in the pond. She blushed again, and despite the attempt to shrug it off her mind, she couldn't. As she approached the pond, an unexpected view greeted her. She froze in stunned silence.</p>

  <p>Instead of a half-naked Luo Zheng, she saw a completely empty pond. "Where's the flood dragon blood?!" she asked in astonishment. She was dumbfounded to see that all the flood dragon flood had disappeared after Luo Zheng stayed in it for some time. How could that be possible?</p>

  <p>The flood dragon blood was a priceless treasure. It would be extremely improbable for an ordinary human to absorb all the energy in its blood.</p>

  <p>In fact, it would be a great achievement for an ordinary person to even manage to absorb several drops of the blood at once. Tia could still remember leaving the pond full just some moments ago, only to come back to nothing. Absorbing that amount of flood dragon blood would cause a person to suffer a violent death. A normal body would not be able to contain the huge power in the flood dragon blood thus it would explode. It was like filling up a small bag with water. The bag would expand but it could only take so much water that it would eventually explode once it reached its limit. This would be the same fate even for a powerful cultivator like Tia.</p>

  <p>"The flood dragon blood? I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it. I absorbed all of it while you were gone." Luo Zheng replied in an apologetic tone. He couldn't tell Tia what really happened. He also felt somehow guilty about giving all the flood dragon blood to the cyan dragon without letting her know first.</p>

  <p>"What did you say? You absorbed all of it? That's absurd!" Tia's eyes widened in astonishment as she stared at Luo Zheng. She couldn't imagine that Luo Zheng managed to consume so much flood dragon blood and still be here talking to her as if nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, she knew Luo Zheng hadn't left the pond and there was no way he could move the blood somewhere else. Thus, even though it was hard to believe, she knew that Luo Zheng wasn't lying about absorbing all the flood dragon's blood.</p>

  <p>"God, that's a pond full of flood dragon blood!" Tia said in dismay as she approached Luo Zheng. Her face darkened a little in disappointment. It might be true that the flood dragon blood was no use for her, but it could serve as a reward for the disciples in Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Didn't we make an agreement that we will share all of these treasures?</p>

  <p>Now, since you consumed the flood dragon blood all by yourself, I don't see a need for me to share these treasure chests with you now!" Tia spat angrily as she glanced at the treasure chests on the ground. Since there was no way to return the flood dragon's blood, she might as well play with Luo Zheng a little.</p>

  <p>"Hey! That's unreasonable!" Luo Zheng argued back. "You've taken all the herbs from the garden! The Lunar Anesthesia Herb alone is more valuable than the pond of blood. Do you seriously think you can trick me?"</p>

  <p>"You're haggling like a woman! Or maybe, I should also own half of that giant sword of Blood Fiend Emperor. Do you want it that way?" Tia rebutted. She liked it when Luo Zheng was getting annoyed.</p>

  <p>They had quite a quarrel over the rest of the precious inheritances of the grade-six sect. Although Tia was just playing around, she liked the idea of getting square with Luo Zheng after he had selfishly consumed all that flood dragon blood. Luo Zheng, on the other hand, wouldn't agree on anything that Tia offered.</p>

  <p>And after failing to reach an agreement, they both agreed to open the treasure chests first.</p>

  <p>Once they saw what was inside each box and how one could use the item, then they could determine how to divide the treasures.</p>
