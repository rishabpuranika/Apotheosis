  <p>
</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's speed never let up as he gave chase to Sewell on the northwest side of the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King could move at a surprising speed with the gargantuan size.</p>

  <p>Sewell was just right ahead, with the human heroes pierced on his back.</p>

  <p>Some had seen the Monkey Spirit King coming to save them and were already reaching out to him.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King remained loyal to those he trusted.</p>

  <p>These human beings had saved him. He definitely wouldn't allow the Snake Masters to capture them. Not on his watch!</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's footsteps were so heavy, and the surroundings vibrated visibly every time his feet landed on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures in his path grew pale upon seeing him approach. They quickly got well out of the way. They wondered where this terrifying Treacherous Being came from. They had never heard of such a Treacherous Being before.</p>

  <p>"My king, just leap forward and get as close as you can. I'll do the rest,"</p>

  <p>Manuel, standing on the Monkey Spirit King's shoulder, uttered.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had been chasing Sewell for a while now, to no avail. He was starting to feel frustrated. He could have easily killed Sewell before with just one hand. He could have even beaten Cornelius in a fight.</p>

  <p>He took a few steps and leapt forward. This jump drew an arc reaching hundreds of thousands of feet high.</p>

  <p>Manuel launched himself onward while the Monkey Spirit King was in the air. Boosted by the Monkey Spirit King's speed, Manuel now flew toward Sewell like an arrow.</p>

  <p>Manuel still bore a grudge against Sewell for breaking into the Night View Island and trying to steal away the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>There had been a huge gap between their strengths in the past. Manuel had been staying in the Night View Island for so many years and knew nothing about the outside, so Sewell easily tricked him. Manuel was raring for some payback.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A bone stick appeared in Manuel's hand. He spun it like a windmill and swung it at Sewell.</p>

  <p>But Sewell suddenly picked up speed, to Manuel's surprise. Just moments later, Sewell was out of his reach again.</p>

  <p>How was this possible?</p>

  <p>Sewell should have reached his limit by now, having been chased for so long. How could he not be exhausted?</p>

  <p>Had he been just baiting them all this time?</p>

  <p>Perhaps he had other intentions?</p>

  <p>No matter what it was, Manuel wasn't going to give up that easily.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The bone stick in his hand began to glow.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Something strange happened before the weapon could smash down on Sewell.</p>

  <p>The weapon was infinitely compressed!</p>

  <p>"A space wall?" Surprise flashed in Manuel's eyes. Then he smirked.</p>

  <p>This cross-shaped bone stick was considered a supreme treasure in the Human Spirit Sect. It was made from the thigh bones of the Space Ghost after it had been killed in the main world.</p>

  <p>Orlando had asked Kincaid for it and had eventually given it to Manuel.</p>

  <p>The cross-shaped bone stick was used to draw energy from the holy pillar of the Monkey Spirit Sect when Manuel used it, but even without that connection between the stick and the holy pillar now, it still had the talent of the Space Ghost. It could shatter all space!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The compressed cross-shaped bone stick spun and broke through the space wall.</p>

  <p>Manuel's smirk grew wider. As he moved to retrieve the bone stick and continue chasing Sewell, he looked up ahead and froze.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King ran over from behind. He picked Manuel up and raised him up on his palm. "Why are you stopping? Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"They're gone," Manuel said. He pointed ahead.</p>

  <p>"What?" The Monkey Spirit King stopped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>Sewell and the human heroes on his back disappeared from view as soon as the space wall was broken.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it was all just an illusion created by the space," Hagar lamented.</p>

  <p>"No wonder our king couldn't catch up with him no matter how fast he got!" Nereus shook his head.</p>

  <p>They had been tricked by an illusion all this time!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King stamped his feet in frustration.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>"Cornelius! Come out!"</p>

  <p>The impact his feet made exerted such immense force on the ground, and a large number of cracks appeared.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was alert and sensitive most of the time, but when he was angry, he just wanted to tear Cornelius into pieces.</p>

  <p>Manuel and Tearrag couldn't even dare try to appease him now. They just stood on his shoulder in silence.</p>

  <p>The power of space suddenly began to gather in front of the Monkey Spirit King. The soil and stones on the ground were lifted in the air bit by bit by the space force until they formed a huge snake shape. The Snake Spirit King's voice suddenly rang out. "How much do you hate me, Orlando?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tear you apart," the Monkey Spirit King snarled.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King sighed and took on an earnest tone. "Your Monkey Spirit Sect will also benefit if my plan succeeds, you know. I will help you develop the Monkey Spirit Sect, making it prosperous and powerful again..."</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King threw a heavy punch.</p>

  <p>It smashed through the huge snake formed by the soil and stones. The impact created a deep crater on the ground.</p>

  <p>"You can't fool me twice," the Monkey Spirit King spat out.</p>

  <p>With a sinister sound, the stones and soil rose up in the air again and turned into the shape of the Snake Spirit King. "Come to the Heavenly Square City, if you want to beat me so badly..."</p>

  <p>As he said this, the space power formed a huge whirlpool emitting a blue light. It was a space channel.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King looked at the space channel, severely tempted by it.</p>

  <p>"My king, be careful. This may be another trick," Manuel cautioned urgently, trying to stop him.</p>

  <p>The other Monkey Masters, such as Tearrag, Hagar and Nereus, likewise glared at the channel with suspicion.</p>

  <p>Cornelius had caused so much trouble to the Monkey Spirit Sect, so they were convinced this space channel was nothing but a trap.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King hesitated.</p>

  <p>He was confident in his unparalleled strength, but he knew he was far inferior to Cornelius in intelligence. That was why he had chosen to cooperate with Zheng and the other human beings. He just hadn't expected that the Snake Spirit King would be able to separate them upon their arrival at the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King chose to be clear-headed and rational this time.</p>

  <p>He refused to step into the channel.</p>

  <p>However, visions suddenly appeared at the center of the space channel.</p>

  <p>They were the images of the monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City not so long ago.</p>

  <p>"It's Alston!"</p>

  <p>"Alston is still alive?"</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City?"</p>

  <p>The strength of Alston was a bit inferior to that of Hagar, and he was once ranked fourth in the Monkey Spirit Sect. He was a good friend to Manuel and Tearrag.</p>

  <p>But the next vision showed that the monkey spirits were executed, and that their coordinates were destroyed along with them.</p>

  <p>"NO!" Manuel roared.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King rushed toward the space channel without any hesitation at this moment.</p>
