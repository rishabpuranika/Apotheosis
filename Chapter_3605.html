<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The second No. 13 stepped on the Nihility Spirit, the green flames within his body streamed downward along his legs until they flowed onto the Nihility Spirit beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>The green flames covered the surface of the red ball, effectively corroding it.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves were created by the fire spirits of the Element Spirit race. The green flames that formed the Moon Fire Slaves' bodies were called the "Magical Star Flame". The fire spirits of the Element Spirit race had a great control over the flames, and the Magical Star Flame could be considered to be the embodiment of the fire spirits' greatest achievement.</p>

  <p>Although the power of the Moon Fire Slaves was suppressed in Stage Seventeen, the power of the Magical Star Flame could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>"Burn it to ashes. Ha-ha..." No. 13 pressed his heel down firmly on the red ball, and the green flames continued to pour forth.</p>

  <p>Although the surface of the red ball sizzled and sputtered under the heat of the Magical Star Flames, its inside remained intact.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Everyone present exchanged confused glances at the sound of three buzzes from within the red ball.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>A column of blood shot out from the red ball. The blood spurted out violently, and it formed the shape of a huge, bloody hand. Grabbing No. 13, it raised him high and smashed him downwards so hard that the ground shook.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Every time No. 13 was smashed into the ground, pieces of his armor fell off one by one. Gradually, the green flames within his body began to sputter out.</p>

  <p>No. 14, who was following closely behind, rushed towards the red ball as he screamed at the top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>However, before No. 14 could even get close, another column of blood shot out from the red ball, also forming a giant hand. The hand grabbed No. 14 before he even had the time to think. He too was being smashed violently into the ground.</p>

  <p>The two Moon Fire Slaves collided in a heaping mess of destroyed armor and deformed green flames.</p>

  <p>Even though the Moon Fire Slaves couldn't be hurt so easily, the energy of their spiritual cores was being exhausted as they were being smashed to a pulp. If this kept up, they would return to the state of the spiritual cores...</p>

  <p>As for the spiritual core of the Moon Fire Slave, it was difficult for ordinary Other Shore creatures to destroy it. In fact, these Moon Fire Slaves had died many times before and turned into the spiritual cores; time and time again, they were rescued by the Element Spirit race, returning to their original state.</p>

  <p>However, the Nihility race had a way to completely destroy the spiritual cores.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>Just as the green flames on the bodies of the two Moon Fire Slaves were about to die out completely, a deep voice suddenly roared, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>No. 12 held up a red ball in his hand. Twelve Magical Star Flames with different shapes hovered next to him. Each Magical Star Flame had a thin thread of fire drawn out, forming a unique array.</p>

  <p>This magic array was the Magical Explosion Array?one of the most powerful methods of the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>While No. 13 and No. 14 fought this Nihility Spirit, No. 12 had been busy subduing another one. Just when No. 12 was about to finish off his opponent, he saw that his two subordinates were in grave danger.</p>

  <p>Left with no other choices, he took the subdued Nihility Spirit as a hostage.</p>

  <p>If No. 12's Magical Explosion Array exploded, even the red ball wouldn't be able to protect the creature within.</p>

  <p>"Let her out of the array, and I'll stop." An enchanting feminine voice echoed from the ball that was holding the two Moon Fire Slaves with bloody hands. It was the same woman who had saved Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>With a slight nod from No. 12, the twelve Magical Star Flames were absorbed back into his body. Gently, he tossed the red ball onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the two bloody hands released the two Moon Fire Slaves, and receded back into the red ball.</p>

  <p>A skeleton emerged from the inside of the red ball that had just attacked the Moon Fire Slaves. It looked relatively unharmed, but upon a closer look, some grey scars could be seen on it.</p>

  <p>"What a pity..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head in disappointment. He didn't like how this scene was playing out.</p>

  <p>If both sides had gotten terribly injured, this would've been a good thing.</p>

  <p>Conversely, if they stopped fighting with each other, this was bad news for Luo Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>As flesh and blood congealed on the skeleton, slowly, the figure of a human woman was formed. The other Nihility Spirit that had just been held hostage quickly retreated behind the woman. "If you want to settle this," the human woman said coldly, "we would love to oblige you."</p>

  <p>The Nihility race and the Element Spirit race had been at war for the longest time. Most of the time, the Element Spirit race had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>They were usually able to subdue the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Even so, the Nihility race had never backed off. To a certain extent, the Element Spirit race had no way of completely finishing off the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>No. 12 looked at the human woman coldly. "Sadly, I'm not in the mood to destroy you right now. My only goal is to catch that guy and take him back.</p>

  <p>It has nothing to do with you!" he said, eyes narrowing, It was through the Elephant Man race that the Moon Fire Slaves knew about Luo Zheng's possession of the Other Shore Key. No. 12 thought that the Nihility race knew nothing of this, so he was hoping he could divert the Nihility Spirits' attention from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"True, you catching him might have nothing to do with us," the human woman smiled slyly. "But he has the key to the temple, which has a great deal to do with us!"</p>

  <p>No. 12's expression darkened.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, he said, "Since everyone's goal is to get to the temple, why not we join forces for now? We can put our prior disagreements aside for the time being, and open the temple first."</p>

  <p>The three forces had spent a lot of time and energy in trying to open up this temple. Finally, the Other Shore Key was within reach, so how could they possibly let go of this opportunity?</p>

  <p>"That's right. Just get that guy's hand first," No. 14 chipped in.</p>

  <p>Just minutes ago, No. 13 and No. 14 had been badly beaten by the human woman. By now, they had replenished some star dust, enough for them to recover. The green flames that were sputtering out were now much more dense and lively.</p>

  <p>"Of course we will get that hand," another Nihility Spirit said.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Whoever gets it can possess it!"</p>

  <p>No. 14 was the closest to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly strode towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Knock, knock, knock..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been listening to their conversation. Hearing them discuss as though he were already dead made him furious. As No. 14 headed towards him, a trace of killing intent flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The chances of him winning against two powerful races were incredibly slim.</p>

  <p>However, it just so happened that these two races were mortal enemies. He could use this against them and fight them with all his might.</p>

  <p>Just as No. 14 was a few steps away from him, the Wild God Power within Luo Zheng's body suddenly erupted.</p>
