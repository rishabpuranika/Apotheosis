<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's name appeared on the ninth row.</p>

  <p>A lot of creatures from different races had been paying close attention to Zheng's performance.</p>

  <p>It could be claimed that he was already on the same level as Boris and Cheryl with what he had shown all of them.</p>

  <p>Quite a lot of people already thought highly of him despite still having yet to fight with Boris.</p>

  <p>There had never been such a talent in the human race.</p>

  <p>Zheng had entered the tenth floor with the cultivation of a tenth-level war fighter and that was a feat that had never yet been done in the entire Sea God Continent. Not even Amber could do it.</p>

  <p>Of course, the circumstances of the era also played a part.</p>

  <p>Back then, there hadn't been any fixed rules with regards to advancing freely. Although Amber was powerful, she had still needed to climb from the very bottom all the way to the top.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the ogres had time and again sent a large number of talents to challenge and possibly defeat her. Amber met and fought with her opponents one after the other and obtained significantly more Lucky Light than Zheng. The deterrence that the ogres sent actually contributed to her improving her cultivation at a much faster rate.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, could freely advance and the amount of Lucky Light he received was significantly less, which did not really benefit his cultivation.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because the ogres were scared of him, but they had grown weaker over the years and couldn't really afford to send away most of their talents as they did back then with Amber. Since their assassination attempt had failed, then maybe it would be better to let him freely advance to the tenth floor and just let Boris finish him.</p>

  <p>Had they barred his way and let him stay on the lower floors to improve his cultivation, then Boris might end up not being a match for Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other races were very much interested in Zheng's talent, but it was the humans who were most concerned.</p>

  <p>A trace of nervousness flashed on Olivia's face.</p>

  <p>She knew that the humans clearly understood the meaning of Zheng's appearance.</p>

  <p>To them in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, Zheng was like a heart-strengthening drug that they hoped could change their fate. Even before he had stepped into the Purple Heart Sacred Place, he was already quite famous, and disciples and elders at the Soul Sea Realm alike were already keeping an eye out for him because of his strength.</p>

  <p>"I wonder just how far Zheng can go."</p>

  <p>"I think he'll at least make it to the fourth floor. I'm pretty confident that he's got a lot more potential than Boris."</p>

  <p>"Mm, even if he can't defeat Boris now, Zheng will still grow further in the future and his power will not be something that Boris himself can even compare with."</p>

  <p>Boris heard all this since he wasn't standing too far away but chose to hold his tongue.</p>

  <p>Honestly speaking, he also agreed with their speculations. He had never overestimated his strength, nor did he ever underestimate his opponents. He was, after all, a war general of the tenth level, and if he were to return to being a war fighter of the tenth level, it would be impossible for him to reach the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Back when he was still a tenth-level war fighter, Boris had been able to challenge those who were of a higher level than him. However, he could only challenge third-level war generals and had once lost to a fifth-level war general.</p>

  <p>This was how he knew he was inferior to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he was not discouraged. Talent was innate, but luck and perseverance could be honed by a person.</p>

  <p>The previous gloominess in the room suddenly brightened upon Zheng's appearance.</p>

  <p>He had always been curious as to just how the Talent Tablet worked and carried out the talent test.</p>

  <p>Talent was different from trial, after all. The trial was a direct test of a martial artist's strength and constantly used magic arrays to create enemies for those being tested. The participants would fight until their bodies gave up on them and, after that, their grade would come out.</p>

  <p>But how about the talent test?</p>

  <p>He was just about to find out.</p>

  <p>A beam of light suddenly shot down in front of Zheng, and nine stone tablets appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" he remarked. He could feel strong Law Power emanating from the tablets.</p>

  <p>"The Law Power on these tablets completely corresponds to my own Law Power," he couldn't help but shout.</p>

  <p>It definitely wasn't a coincidence.</p>

  <p>Maybe the Talent Tablet had sensed the Law Power within him and placed these nine stone tablets here.</p>

  <p>The Law Power within the stones was actually much stronger than the one contained within the obelisks of the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked towards the tablets and spread out his perception on them.</p>

  <p>"This is…</p>

  <p>The second layer of Law Power!" he said, eyes widening in shock.</p>

  <p>All the Law Powers were divided into ten layers.</p>

  <p>Zheng had a perfect affinity with any law after his baptism, so it was easy for him to cultivate laws. Back in the Genuine Dragon World, he had learned the first layer of Law Power, but after coming back to the Central Region, he could find no place to practice the second layer. Even warriors who had reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm failed in cultivating the complete Law Powers since most of the parts were missing, such as the Space Law, and could only be comprehended by themselves.</p>

  <p>However, it was unrealistic to completely rely on one's own comprehension when it came to the Original Laws.</p>

  <p>Zheng never thought a chance such as this would present itself in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>After investigating each tablet one by one, Zheng chose to go to the one that had recorded the power of Space Law first and began comprehending it.</p>

  <p>He didn't really think there was a time limit and he honestly didn't care too much about the ranking. That sort of bubble reputation was only important to the Purple Heart Sacred Place since, for a race, it was almost like a spiritual totem.</p>

  <p>Zheng could care less. Cultivating the laws was infinitely more important, and he planned to learn them all from these stone tablets before leaving.</p>

  <p>However, just as he chose the Space Law stone tablet, the other eight ones slowly faded and disappeared before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"WHAT! NO!" he exclaimed, feeling his stomach drop once all other stone tablets disappeared. "No, no, no, how can this be?"</p>

  <p>Just as he had chosen one tablet, the rest immediately disappeared! Such a good opportunity had been lost.</p>

  <p>He could do nothing but sigh in bitter disappointment. Fortunately, the stone tablet in front of him hadn't disappeared. Not wasting any more time, Zheng concentrated and began to comprehend the power of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Even before the baptism by laws, Zheng's compatibility with the Space Law had already been the highest. Back then, he had only encountered space windstorm wherein he was able to learn the power of the law. Now that he had a ready-made space stone tablet, everything was a breeze.</p>

  <p>'The Talent Tablet is only a test of the speed at which one comprehends laws?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>If his assumption was right, then it wouldn't be difficult for him since he was originally very sensitive to the Space Law, and after his baptism by laws, his affinity with it had only increased to an unprecedentedly high level.</p>

  <p>He didn't know that as he comprehended, his ranking on the wall was also changing.</p>

  <p>Just like Yolande's name, Zheng's was also rising rapidly.</p>

  <p>The ninth row.</p>

  <p>The eighth row.</p>

  <p>The seventh row.</p>

  <p>Soon, his name was listed right beside Olivia's.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's name is rising fast! It's even faster than Yolande's. Will he rise to the first row as well?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. The Talent Tablet doesn't test strength or speed. Speed doesn't determine the ranking. Last time, a divine-level talent stayed on the ninth row for two hours before his name went up to the fourth row."</p>

  <p>"Look! His name has stopped on the sixth row. Could it be that he is as talented as Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"What's the hurry? Let's just wait and see. As long as he's in there, there's no way to arrive at a conclusion."</p>

  <p>Olivia heard all of this but did not say anything. For some reason, she had a mysterious premonition in her heart that Zheng would definitely achieve good results.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to expect him to be in the first row like Yolande, but he could at least enter the third row and become a figure that was only inferior to Amber.</p>

  <p>Yolande, who wasn't originally interested in anything that was happening, was now also expressionlessly staring at the rankings on the wall. It looked as if she was also anticipating the result, but nobody could really tell for sure.</p>

  <p>Dylon, on the other hand, was extremely gloomy.</p>

  <p>The sixth row. Zheng had already climbed to the sixth row and it was a huge blow to his ego. He had also been known as a divine-level talent in the sacred place and was on par with Olivia. However, after the test, his name had only come up to the seventh row.</p>

  <p>A lot of people were also listed on the seventh to ninth rows. His ranking was quite low, and it wouldn't be long before he was completely squeezed out.</p>

  <p>He merely looked at Zheng's name on the sixth row and quietly resigned himself to his fate.</p>
