<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Edmond was all charged up and determined to catch Luo Zheng all by himself.</p>

  <p>The scene resembled some human trying to catch a fly with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>What had started as a playful confrontation, had now turned into a frustrating conflict. Immediately, within ten thousand feet, the area was engulfed by infinite blood red lightning.</p>

  <p>When Atlas in the distance saw the scene unravel, he could not help but shiver. "That guy is a rare talent in the divine land. I'm afraid that he will face his end soon."</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Yan screamed.</p>

  <p>Edmond attacked so fast that Yan didn't have any time to react.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were wide open as she looked at the circle of red lightning. She was smoldering with anger.</p>

  <p>With the whistling of the wind, her body suddenly flew in the air, and the huge shadow of Snake Goddess followed her.</p>

  <p>They dashed towards Edmond regardless of the consequences.</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Yan and the shadow were rushing towards him, Edmond waved his huge hand.</p>

  <p>He threw a punch in the air that transformed into a huge fist shadow.</p>

  <p>Now the fight erupted between the fist and the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The shadow of Snake Goddess endured the blow, and its surface began to glow brightly.</p>

  <p>Yan was still finding it difficult to control the shadow of Snake Goddess, although it was only in its primary form.</p>

  <p>As Harold had said earlier, even though the power of the shadow of Snake Goddess was extraordinary, it did not really belong to the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how extraordinary it was, the shadow of Snake Goddess that Yan controlled was equivalent to an infant. It was not strong enough to beat a fiend.</p>

  <p>The light on the surface of the shadow of Snake Goddess flickered for a while and then started to fade. Suddenly, purple light started gathering to Yan's chest.</p>

  <p>The purple light in her eyes began to flicker rapidly and she looked very painful. Suddenly her body fell down from midair.</p>

  <p>And the counterattack had already begun.</p>

  <p>Unreconciled, Yan looked at the sea of red lightning and said in a low tone, "Luo Zheng, I'm sorry that I failed to protect you."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Yan was feeling completely helpless at the turn of fate.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>Yan fell to the ground, and the shadow was still shrinking towards her chest.</p>

  <p>As it kept shrinking, Yan's mind was gradually being devoured.</p>

  <p>After it completely devoured, it would have the upper hand and have control over Yan's physical body.</p>

  <p>From that moment on, Yan would completely be another kind of creature.</p>

  <p>That was why, at the Everest Spirit Mountain, Harold had told Yan to refrain from summoning the shadow of Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Lying sprawled on the ground, Yan was strangely calm. Her mouth kept twitching, as she looked at the lightning.</p>

  <p>"What a pity not to see you now, Luo Zheng," she murmured.</p>

  <p>When Enoch, who was standing under the cyan stone tablet, saw this scene, he sighed, "Such a miserable end of an amazing pair of brother and sister. At this rate, there is no way even I can escape."</p>

  <p>In spite of this situation, he didn't regret his choice, even for a moment.</p>

  <p>Even if he ran along the lines of the mist, it would be difficult for him to escape death.</p>

  <p>How many of the True Gods who had fled away could safely leave the debate venue?</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone thought that Luo Zheng was going to die.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, one could see a figure running amidst the blood red lightning.</p>

  <p>Yan's eyes blinked and a trace of confusion appeared on her face, but the figure became clearer, as it got closer. When she recognized the figure, her eyes widened in amazement.</p>

  <p>A golden light shone from Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"The Promise of Absolute Beginning!"</p>

  <p>Even Edmond had a look of surprise.</p>

  <p>The Promise of Absolute Beginning could ignore the erosion of all the energy in the divine land.</p>

  <p>As an illusion created by the negative Faith Energy in the divine land, Edmond was comparatively stronger, but he still couldn't hurt Luo Zheng, because the power he used was still from the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng rushed out, he used all his strength and ran towards Yan.</p>

  <p>At the same time, an idea was forming in his mind.</p>

  <p>He called out to Xun, who swung her long spear and jumped on Edmond's body at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Compared to Edmond's huge body, Xun's body was as small as a flea.</p>

  <p>But size just didn't matter, as Xun, quick as lightning, jumped up in front of Edmond and thrust out the spear in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Splat!"</p>

  <p>Before Edmond could react, the spear pierced through his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng picked up Yan from the ground.</p>

  <p>He didn't have time to choose the direction, but just kept running wildly.</p>

  <p>Reinhard hollered a command, "All members of the Sword Clan, try to cover them!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard and the others' sacrifice was worth it if Luo Zheng and Yan could be saved.</p>

  <p>Led by Reinhard, the disciples of the Sword Clan transformed into a huge sword again and charged at Edmond.</p>

  <p>"Go away!"</p>

  <p>Edmond was bloody with the spear hit and fuming with rage.</p>

  <p>He flicked off Xun and sent her flying.</p>

  <p>But when the members of the Sword Clan came over, he didn't even spare them a glance. Instead, he merely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Since he could perform the spatial transference in the debate venue, there was no way the two ant-like figures could escape.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng carried Yan and barely flew for ten miles, when Edmond's figure loomed in front of them like an unbreakable mountain.</p>

  <p>"You're even more tenacious than the Dead Soul Worm in the Abyss Demon Region," Edmond said, looking coldly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Holding Yan in his arms, Luo Zheng began to retreat, as his heart sank.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to fight with a fiend who was as strong as a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>He had two Promises of Absolute Beginning left. But Yan was unable to resist the blood red lightning. Was this their end?</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng," Yan called out, her lips bloodless. She braced herself up and reached out to stroke Luo Zheng's face. "You've tried your best. Don't struggle anymore."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly!" Luo Zheng was furiously thinking of a way as he kept retreating.</p>

  <p>Unlike Yan, he had earlier experienced similar situations. And never had he given up on any kind of situation before.</p>

  <p>"Yan is right." Duke's voice came faintly from behind Luo Zheng. "Your struggle is meaningless. To meet death is your final destination!"</p>

  <p>Having known that he could not escape death, Duke followed Luo Zheng fearlessly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at him indifferently and sneered, "You are like a maggot yourself. Do you think that everyone in the world is like you?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, Edmond smiled and said, "Your so-called Gods are similar to maggots in my eyes!"</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" Duke mocked. "Who do you think you are? Why do you pretend to be nobler than me? Haha..."</p>

  <p>The wild laughter was very harsh, and Luo Zheng's face was ashen.</p>

  <p>Duke continued to laugh, looking at Luo Zheng's predicament.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a soft female voice could be heard from the thick mist.</p>

  <p>"Why? Because he is my son"</p>

  <p>As soon as these words were spoken, a slender figure slowly walked out of the mist.</p>
