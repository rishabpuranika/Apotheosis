<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Not long after Dalton finished speaking though, a second batch of disciples who also launched the Truth Competition towards Luo Zheng were enlightened.</p>

  <p>Their reactions were exactly the same as those of the first three disciples.</p>

  <p>They were surprised at first and then immediately concentrated on reciting the Truth of Godly Way in order to verify their ideas.</p>

  <p>There were anywhere between twenty and thirty disciples in the second batch. It was far from a coincidence that each of them broke through the bottleneck, one by one.</p>

  <p>"Can our disciples break through their bottlenecks after sparring with Luo Zheng?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>"Why is the Truth of Godly Way he infuses so magical?" someone else chimed in.</p>

  <p>"It's proof that the way he apprehends the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent is very unique... and unbelievably precise!"</p>

  <p>In that very instant, everyone was astonished, even the officiant. With his mouth slightly agape, he asked, "How... how could this have happened?"</p>

  <p>He had been in charge of the sword observation for such a long time now and over all these years, never had he seen such a bizarre occurrence.</p>

  <p>The palace leaders were equally surprised, but rather delighted. Luo Zheng had helped dozens of disciples break through all at the same time, and that had been a great aid to the cultivation palaces.</p>

  <p>"He should be a perfect match for the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. His truth aura is so perfect that it's actually pure when left in other disciples' minds during the Truth Competition. It has an excellent effect... I've heard of it once or twice before, but it has never occurred directly in our Sword Light Palace," Laura stated indifferently.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword could respond to the disciples with the matched aura of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Nonetheless, the Lofty Sword's guide lacked flexibility in the end.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng was on the same page with these disciples, having comprehended over 3, 000 words too. So the truth he had comprehended was what these disciples needed most, making the fight with him more effective than the Lofty Sword itself.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Demon Sword Palace blinked her eyes a few times and came up with an idea. "Can we ask Luo Zheng to stop comprehending the remaining words and stay at this stage for a while?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Many disciples of the cultivation palaces had been trapped within this stage.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng stayed at this level, the disciples' cultivation speed would greatly improve in the future.</p>

  <p>Regardless, this remained a shameless idea. No one was willing to delay their own cultivation for others. Everyone only thought of themselves.</p>

  <p>Even Dalton thought this suggestion was an unacceptable one, and thus, he chose to remain silent instead.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the suggestion, Ingram sneered and said, "Charlene, do you really think the disciples of your Demon Sword Palace are superior to the disciples of my Sword Dance Palace? I'm afraid that all the losers from your Demon Sword Palace aren't even worth a single Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Hearing what Ingram had said, Charlene felt embarrassed. She replied coldly, "I'm just making a proposal. Besides, Luo Zheng only joined your Sword Dance Palace less than a month ago, am I right? He is nothing more than an outsider. I've done all of this for the Qiu Clan's, the Yuebai Clan's and even the entire Sword Light Palace's sake!"</p>

  <p>"Oh really, now? I'm afraid that we can't keep Luo Zheng in the Sword Light Palace. If you really think this is a good idea, you can go and tell Luo Zheng himself in person. If Luo Zheng can gain his reputation in the Taiyi Heaven Palace in the future, you'll face all the trouble caused by him alone. What do you think about that?" asked Ingram with a cold smile pressed on his lips.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, Charlene's face darkened. She ultimately chose to keep silent. She knew that Luo Zheng wouldn't agree to this unless she put pressure on him, in the name of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>In this way, she knew she'd completely offend him.</p>

  <p>On the platform, Kenelm, Hyde, Faegan and Jago, in a foolish manner, watched Luo Zheng recite the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, don't you have a bottleneck?" questioned Kenelm, slightly dazed and confused.</p>

  <p>All things considered, he himself had hit a wall at the point of only twelve words.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, no one in the Excellence City has been capable of doing such a thing, including the city lord," mentioned Hyde, sporting a complicated expression.</p>

  <p>"That makes sense. The lord of the Excellence City is nobody. There are many people who haven't encountered bottlenecks after comprehending over 3, 000 words in our Sword Light Palace. Among this batch of disciples, Elgin and Beldene both can fulfill the latter. And if I remember correctly, Elgin's record was 4, 300 words at his first time and Beldene's was 4, 250. Correct me if I'm wrong, of course," said Faegan.</p>

  <p>"Wow! That's amazing! Incredible! The Sword Light Palace really does have many talents," exclaimed Hyde in an excited tone.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the talents in the small Excellence City, or even the Gracious Province, were hardly worth mentioning at all.</p>

  <p>Wrapping his arms around himself, Jago smiled and said, "Yes, but we know Luo Zheng is different. I have a feeling he might break Elgin's record!"</p>

  <p>As everyone continued talking among themselves, Luo Zheng passed the threshold of 3, 800 words and went straight for 4, 000 words, still in continuous recitation.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern continued to grow and climb higher and higher on the Lofty Sword, the number of disciples on his level only continued to decrease, and so did the number of disciples coming to Luo Zheng for the Truth Competition.</p>

  <p>Still, some strong disciples wouldn't let go of such an opportunity, especially once they became aware of Luo Zheng's uses. Almost everyone above Luo Zheng's level controlled their sword-shaped patterns in an attempt to wait for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In other words, Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern kept going upward through constant Truth Competitions, which only added a certain level of difficulty to the task.</p>

  <p>"4, 000 words..."</p>

  <p>"It truly appears that he might actually break both Elgin's and Beldene's records!"</p>

  <p>"Do you really think he can break them?"</p>

  <p>At first, both Elgin and Beldene were engaged in the fierce Truth Competition.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was written in 9, 449 words. Now, the two of them had already comprehended over 9, 000 words. They were only a step away from driving the Soul of Light to enter the Sea of Truth that they had dreamed of.</p>

  <p>Both of them now had their sword-shaped patterns appearing at the top of the Lofty Sword, leaving the other disciples far behind. Currently, the number three disciple had reached just under 7, 000 words.</p>

  <p>What Elgin and Beldene cared about the most however, was keeping their own records.</p>

  <p>As he learned the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent for the first time, Elgin's record was 4, 300 words and Beldene's was 4, 250. Their records could be in the top thirty even when compared with those of the disciples from former batches.</p>

  <p>Elgin and Beldene were satisfied with the result, and this could be read in their expressions. Of course, never had they thought any disciple could surpass their records.</p>

  <p>Today though, a new disciple in the Sword Dance Palace had broken through the 4, 000-word mark. This amazed them to an even greater extent.</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Sword Dance Palace, except for those from the big clans, are all mediocre people who came from small places. How can there be such a person this time?" asked Beldene, his eyebrows furrowed.</p>

  <p>Another disciple beside Beldene said, "It's said that this batch of new disciples came here because they had discovered the former palace leader's tomb. I wonder if that guy has received a certain kind of blessing from the former palace leader..."</p>
