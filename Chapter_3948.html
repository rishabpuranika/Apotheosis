<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the Dark Haze Peak, Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi opened their eyes almost at the same time.</p>

  <p>No one spoke at first, the silence cutting through the air.</p>

  <p>They knew that they could truly escape from the crisis only if they found a secret place to retreat from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If they left the Other Shore under the watchful eyes of the public, they would probably never be able to return. The Element Spirit Civilization would most likely stay in the Flaming Maple Forest until the end of the world.</p>

  <p>But just now, they had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>"King Ieuan is in the Divine River and can't leave the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess whispered.</p>

  <p>"Go and have a look!" Fuxi stood up.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi turned into beams of light and flew away, Zheng following them without hesitation.</p>

  <p>This time, they went to the Flaming Maple Forest under King Ieuan's guidance. They hadn't expected such a huge mess would be caused.</p>

  <p>On a different peak, Dempsey of the Ear Mouse race and several other Ear Mice stood guard. King Ieuan maintained its original posture, looking normal.</p>

  <p>Dempsey cupped its hands towards Fuxi and said, "Human Sovereign, King Ieuan is now cultivating on the Other Shore. Please..."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Fuxi, shaking his head. "We were together moments ago, but now, King Ieuan can't leave the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Dempsey and the other Ear Mice were shocked at these words.</p>

  <p>They had heard of how dangerous the Three Purities Stage was. Now that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were forced to leave the Other Shore, King Ieuan might be in danger.</p>

  <p>"What happened to King Ieuan?"</p>

  <p>"Is something big happening in the Grand Pure Realm?"</p>

  <p>"Why can't our king escape from the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were worried as they shot question after question.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked at King Ieuan and said, "It's not a big deal. King Ieuan might not be caught."</p>

  <p>Splash, splash...</p>

  <p>As it saw several members of alien races jumping into the Divine River, King Ieuan quickly turned around and swam towards the river's side.</p>

  <p>It couldn't leave the Other Shore at the moment, and there was no way for it to survive even if it swam to either side of the Divine River. It had thought of the same method as Eastern Emperor Taiyi's to hide in the undercurrents of the Divine River.</p>

  <p>It had no time to think about what would need to be done in the future.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan had swum about a hundred feet when panic and despair filled its eyes.</p>

  <p>About ten people were gathering in the direction, preparing to besiege it.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization hadn't left so many people in the Flaming Maple Forest. It was obvious that Norris had bribed these people into arresting it.</p>

  <p>These warriors from alien races who had been staying in the Flaming Maple Forest all year round would do what they were paid to do as long as they got a rich reward. Besides, arresting King Ieuan was a piece of cake for them.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan was then carried into the open space in the forest.</p>

  <p>After keenly observing the place where Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi had disappeared for a while, Norris turned around and walked towards King Ieuan, stretching out a strong finger and pressing it to King Ieuan's head.</p>

  <p>His finger was even bigger than King Ieuan's head.</p>

  <p>"Do they care about your life?" Norris asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied King Ieuan, gritting its teeth.</p>

  <p>"You can die now then," Norris said, making to press his finger even more heavily into Ieuan's head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they do," King Ieuan backtracked.</p>

  <p>After all, it was still afraid of death.</p>

  <p>"Can you deliver my message to them?" Norris asked.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan's eyes lit up, and it thought that Norris would let it leave the Other Shore. "When the Soul Interdicting Water doesn't work, I can leave and relay your words to them!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that," Norris said, shaking his head. "Are they with you? Can they see you?"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan didn't know what Norris wanted to do. It hesitated for a moment and said, "I think they can."</p>

  <p>"Very good." A smile appeared on Norris's face. He raised his thick finger, a sharp nail at its end, and began to write some words on King Ieuan's body, cutting into it as he wrote. Blood began to ooze out of these cuts, leaving deep, dark stains on King Ieuan's fur.</p>

  <p>At the same time, these blood stains also appeared on King Ieuan's body in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>The blood stains continued to expand into a bloody sentence. "Can you see the words?"</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Dempsey and the others saw these words, their faces darkening with each word. King Ieuan had already fallen into their hands.</p>

  <p>"Come back to the Other Shore and follow me to meet Master Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>He can give you what you want."</p>

  <p>These words extended all the way from King Ieuan's head to its chest and then to its back. King Ieuan was relatively small. Norris's finger, on the other hand, was thick and large. The bloody words quickly covered King Ieuan's entire body.</p>

  <p>When there was no space left on King Ieuan's body for Norris to write, he threw King Ieuan aside like garbage. He turned around, looked at the place where Zheng, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had disappeared, and waited.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit hoped that Norris could catch Zheng. If he couldn't, then he could choose to kill him. So the first step that Norris had to take was to persuade Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't planning to return to the Other Shore anytime soon. Norris's eyes narrowed as he drew a blood line on his arm and with a tug, he forcefully removed his left arm from his shoulder.</p>

  <p>And though his arm was now separated from his body, it still was under his control.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the alien races that had followed and supported Norris knew what he wanted to do, and retreated hastily. The three members of the Misty River race watched the scene unfold, their expressions cold but guarded.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The palm of his broken left arm flashed, as a ray of orange light began to gather on its surface. Norris then controlled his left arm to grab something in the void.</p>

  <p>In the Pear Hill, Fuxi suddenly felt dizzy and soon found himself back on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Before Fuxi could react, Norris pulled him to his side.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The nonhuman creatures beside him had already prepared the Soul Interdicting Water and immediately poured it on Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Some maple leaves began to float towards the broken left arm and one by one, attached themselves to it.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>And then, the maple leaves exploded, turning Norris's left arm into dust.</p>

  <p>"Have I caught the wrong person? It doesn't matter. I will catch you all!"</p>

  <p>Norris said, with a demented smile on his face.</p>

  <p>His shoulder shook slightly as a new arm grew out of the stump.</p>

  <p>Norris liked to strengthen his own body, but he had no choice in the Flaming Maple Forest but to use his left arm to grab Zheng. This new left arm was much weaker than the previous one.</p>

  <p>In the Pear Hill, Zheng and the Snake Goddess were confused, not having known what had happened. Fuxi had lost consciousness and fallen to the ground.</p>

  <p>It was not until the same handwriting as that on King Ieuan's body appeared on Fuxi's chest that they realized that Fuxi had been pulled back to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You can't escape. You're next."</p>

  <p>Both the Snake Goddess and Zheng panicked at these words.</p>

  <p>They had never heard of anyone who had such abilities. But Fuxi's plight had them believing that someone could catch people in the chaos and pull them back to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't panic for long. Like Fuxi, she closed her eyes and was also taken back to the Other Shore.</p>
