<br/><br/>

  

  <p>If Zheng and Tianming took 70 percent of the Devil Phantom essences, and even if the man from Cloud Hall didn't take any, the remaining 30 percent would be divided among four people.</p>

  <p>"You two are taking 70 percent? Do you think Frank and I are just foils for you?" Lois asked coldly. The woman was clearly unhappy with the proposal. She strongly believed that the Devil Phantom essences belonged only to Frank and herself.</p>

  <p>And Frank made sure to express his displeasure as well. "Zheng, I'll give you 30 percent on account that you made some contributions. But I wasn't expecting you to be asking for so much, and wanting to take half of the essences. I am not a pushover, or easily persuaded, I tell you. I'm a tough nut to crack."</p>

  <p>With a sharp look, Zheng said, "I don't care whether you're soft or tough, anyway. Tianming and I will take 70 percent, and that's it!"</p>

  <p>Frank signed and a long blood dragon appeared on the white spear hilt in his hand. Waving the spear slightly, he directed its point to the ground.</p>

  <p>Then solemnly he said, "I don't like internal strife. But if anyone in the team tries to stir up trouble and disrupt our harmony, I don't mind teaching him the lesson and making him learn the rules first!"</p>

  <p>When he saw that Frank was poised to fight, Zheng also took out his Blood Drinking Sword. He shook his head and said, "Frank, you have good strength, but if you think you can become a leader with your strength alone, I can only say that you're too arrogant."</p>

  <p>Once he finished speaking, the consummate sword intent began to gather on the Blood Drinking Sword. The consummate sword intent was like a little spirit that danced happily on the point of Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tianming came to stand by Zheng and also summoned his consummate sword intent.</p>

  <p>'They both have consummate sword intent?' Frank thought. His eyebrows shot upward at the sight of the sword intent on Zheng's Blood Drinking Sword. Frank might be arrogant, but he was not a fool. Tianming alone was already a threat to him. And here came Zheng, who was even more powerful than Patrick.</p>

  <p>It was disconcerting to find out that Zheng had the eerie purple black life vitality, and now he also learned the young disciple had the ability to condense consummate sword intent! All this made Frank a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>If he had a one-on-one fight with Zheng at this point, Frank was unsure that he could definitely beat the young warrior. Now with Tianming thrown into the mix, the situation was tougher.</p>

  <p>As Frank continued to hesitate, Lewis went to Zheng's side and in his deep voice he said, "I agree with Zheng's proposal. If you have any issues with it, we can solve it through a fight."</p>

  <p>There was silence. Since Patrick didn't seem to have any intention of getting into a fight, and the man from Cloud Hall also didn't say anything, the arrogant Frank finally caved in and lowered his head in embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Frank had never caved in to anything throughout his life. Though a small concession, it was still difficult for Frank to accept the truth. The real problem was that in this situation, he was at a gross disadvantage. Even if he had taken the entire Devil Phantom essences, they still had to find their way out of this Death Road. It was probably unwise for him to battle three people at the same time.</p>

  <p>"All right, I agree!" Frank gritted his teeth. While he nodded, he remained frustrated by the situation.</p>

  <p>Quickly, they picked up the Devil Phantom essences scattered everywhere on the ground. They divided the essences according to the proportion agreed upon, with Zheng taking half of them.</p>

  <p>Watching Zheng stuff bunches of Devil Phantom essences into his space ring, Frank could not help but be mad. However, he had no choice but to grind his teeth and accept the situation. Blowing out a breath, Frank thought, 'When I get out of Cloud Road and come back to the Cloud Hall, I will make you pay then!'</p>

  <p>His father, Emanuel, was a member of Cloud Hall. It would be a piece of cake for him to deal with these elite disciples who just recently joined the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>As for the Devil Phantom essences they had taken, Frank would certainly make sure each one of them returned all to him. Every Devil Phantom essence was invaluable, and there were hundreds of it.</p>

  <p>After dividing the Devil Phantom essences, Frank turned silent.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he was no longer commanding and overbearing as he was earlier. As the group continued their journey, Frank didn't lead the team.</p>

  <p>He and Lois walked together in front, while others followed behind in silence. If not for the fact that the Death Road was fraught with dangers, the newly established team would have already split apart.</p>

  <p>Like the man from Cloud Hall said, this small world came to serve the purpose to cultivate those Dark Devil Phantoms. But except for these apparitions, they didn't meet any other beasts in this small world.</p>

  <p>When they came to the end of the road, a vortex appeared. It was red and looked like balls of fire incessantly rotating.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the fire-like vortex, the eyes of the Cloud Hall disciple suddenly brightened.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, everyone else turned vigilant.</p>

  <p>They had entered different worlds since embarking on their journey on Death Road, with each world full of danger. Just now, everyone almost died. Now, with the red vortex in front of them, how could they not be on high alert?</p>

  <p>However, since they were already on Death Road, there was no way back. Their only choice was to keep moving forward.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what does this red vortex represent?" Zheng suddenly asked. He was speaking to the man from Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The man, who acted mysteriously and didn't want to reveal his true identity, seemed to know a lot of things about Death Road.</p>

  <p>From the beginning, his face had no expression. But when he heard Zheng's question, all of a sudden, he let out a mysterious laugh and said, "What does it mean? We'll know it when we get inside."</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could ask any more questions, the man took a flying leap and jumped into the red vortex.</p>

  <p>After the man jumped in, the world they were in suddenly started to shake. Zheng raised his head and looked at the sky. There appeared several cracks there. The cracks were similar to what he had seen on Cloud Road. These were signs that the small world was ready to break into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Quick, let's get inside!" Zheng commanded. He jumped in without hesitating.</p>

  <p>Then Tianming, Patrick, Frank, and Lois all followed and leaped into the red vortex.</p>

  <p>When Zheng got out of the vortex, his head was down as he fell. So it was quite strange that he could see no ground, and he just kept on falling downward!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The wind whooshed past Zheng's ears. Then he saw the Cloud Hall disciple also fall from the air. At the same time, he found the vortex's exit, which was situated above the abyss.</p>

  <p>The abyss below was dark and seemed bottomless. Nobody knew how deep it was. But if they continued to fall like this, death would probably be the end of them.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, Zheng found several stones floating in the air. The objects were irregular in shape. Some were as big as a table, while others were only the size of a fist. No one knew what kind of force would keep them afloat because none of them was affected by gravity at all.</p>

  <p>"The stones are only good for jumping on!" the young warrior murmured to himself. As the thought crossed his mind, Zheng saw the Cloud Hall disciple suddenly gain momentum in the air through leaping. He twirled his body before being able to stand steadily on a floating stone.</p>
