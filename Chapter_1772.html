<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1772 Geoffrey </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was pretty sure the boy was his son. He could very clearly see that the boy's features matched his own more than those of Yudie.</p>

  <p>The boy was very proficient in dealing with divine features.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Zheng still felt that the divine features should have been created by someone else rather than by the boy himself.</p>

  <p>"You're still young, yet so unruly!" exclaimed Zheng angrily.</p>

  <p>Snap!</p>

  <p>Zheng flicked the air with his fingers and shattered the two divine texture tokens that the boy was holding in this hands.</p>

  <p>The boy looked in disbelief at the shattered divine texture tokens in his hands. He pursed his lips to control his emotions, but could not hold it any longer and burst into tears.</p>

  <p>He was born and brought up in Cloud Hall by Yudie, who dearly loved and cared for the boy. Imogen also accompanied him every day, which was how he developed such a strong personality.</p>

  <p>His not-so-decent reputation was known throughout Cloud Hall. People wondered if there was anyone who would dare to discipline him.</p>

  <p>Because of this, people were wary of approaching him.</p>

  <p>"How dare anybody bully my Geoffrey!" hollered Imogen as she appeared on the other side holding a walking stick.</p>

  <p>Earlier when Zheng announced his arrival at the Cloud Hall, Imogen had already been informed. Hearing Geoffrey crying miserably, she rushed to him, furious that anyone could put her boy in such a state.</p>

  <p>Imogen's heart was torn.</p>

  <p>Zheng's return to Cloud Hall was a joyous occasion to celebrate, but Geoffrey's pitiful state was above everything else now.</p>

  <p>Imogen's lifespan could be considered extremely long among the warriors in the Central Region. After so many years, all her relatives had finally reached their graves, and the only one she was closest to was Yudie.</p>

  <p>Later on, when Yudie became pregnant and gave birth to Geoffrey, Imogen took care of him like her own grandchild.</p>

  <p>Imogen took great care of Yudie when she became pregnant, feeding her with rare and precious herbs and fruits. Soon after Geoffrey was born, Imogen poured the natural energy into his body. She had bathed him with water from the Dragon Saliva Spring till he turned a year old. It was considered to be lucky if a martial artist could drink water from the Dragon Saliva Spring. But Imogen used the water only to bathe Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Imogen did not consider Geoffrey's unruly behavior towards others as a grave problem. After all, he was raised by her own upbringing! Hence when she saw her Geoffrey shedding such precious tears, she was very angry with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing Imogen, Zheng respectfully folded his hands and greeted her,</p>

  <p>"Master Yu."</p>

  <p>Imogen cast an angry glance at Zheng, and then her eyes fell on Margaret.</p>

  <p>She snorted and turned to look at the Godly Geniuses behind Zheng. "Tia went to the Upper World leaving young Geoffrey behind in the Cloud Hall in search of you. Where is she now?" Glancing at Margaret once more, she added, "Why did you come back without Tia by your side?"</p>

  <p>Imogen was only at the third stage of the Life and Death Realm. At this age, it was very difficult for her to advance any further, so she was unable to ascend to the Upper World. She did not even know what was going on in the Upper World, nor did she know it was extremely hard for a warrior to find someone in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, she wouldn't reason with Zheng and would only interrogate him.</p>

  <p>"I came back for Tia. She is being hunted by the sorcerer race and is flying down the ascending passageway," Zheng answered honestly.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>"What?!" Imogen threw the walking stick onto the floor and, a stone board immediately broke into two halves. She exclaimed, "The reason behind Tia's ascension was to find you. And you had the nerve to come back without her?! Tia was definitely blind to marry such an ungrateful bastard like you!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Imogen rage, Lawson and Nathan chuckled under their breath.</p>

  <p>They realized Imogen was being unreasonable, but they couldn't help releasing their amusement. Zheng was not a Supreme Lord or a True God to know that Yudie had ascended. More so it was impossible for him to know which supreme world she had ascended to.</p>

  <p>'Does she think that the Upper World is about the same size as this great world?' they thought.</p>

  <p>As for Lucille and Kurt, they just pretended that they heard nothing.</p>

  <p>After all, this was Zheng's family matter.</p>

  <p>"Why do you slander him this way? There are a hundred thousand supreme worlds, and a single supreme world is many times larger than this great world. Looking for a person in the Upper World is like looking for a needle in a haystack. How can you blame it on Zheng?" Margaret could not help but come forward and defend Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tianming also stepped forward, folded his hands and addressed to Imogen," Master Yu, the current circumstances cannot be really blamed on Zheng. Anyway we are well aware about Yudie's whereabouts. The only reasonable way is to wait for her in this world."</p>

  <p>But Imogen refused to see through reason. All she cared to see was that Yudie had left to find her husband, but he returned with another woman.</p>

  <p>How could this act be forgiven?!</p>

  <p>Imogen had instantly disliked Margaret from the beginning. After flicking her a glance, Imogen said to Zheng, "Seems like you have forgotten Tia, now that you are with this bitch!"</p>

  <p>"Who are you calling a bitch?" Suddenly a bright light flashed in Margaret's eyes and four swords pierced out.</p>

  <p>Margaret's strength was much more powerful than it used to be.</p>

  <p>Although she was at the late stage of the Soul Sea Realm, her killing intent was formidable. The warriors in the Cloud Hall felt that an ancient beast was unleashed. The people trembled under this aura.</p>

  <p>"Waah!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was frightened at this sudden change of events before his eyes.</p>

  <p>First he was reprimanded by Zheng and now Margaret was unleashing her wild side. With a fearful cry, he rushed towards Imogen, who took him in her arms.</p>

  <p>Imogen was equally shocked to see the other side of Margaret. She never liked Margaret and now hated her even more. But she couldn't just fight Margaret head on as the latter was able to destroy the whole Cloud Hall effortlessly. Instantly, Imogen was overcome by the feeling of sorrow.</p>

  <p>She held Geoffrey tightly and murmured, "Geoffrey, you always asked me where your father was. I told you he was the superhero of the Central Region and he would come to you. Now, it seems that he doesn't care for you and your poor mother after all. It is best now you forget him."</p>

  <p>Saying this, she carried Geoffrey and walked away.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was already afraid of Margaret's aura. Now after hearing Imogen, he understood that the man he hated was his father.</p>

  <p>He managed to stick his small head out from Imogen's shoulder and stole a glance at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Lawson laughed out loud. Although the ten of them were destined to deal with the crisis of the universe and watch each other's back, secretly they were happy to see Zheng getting humiliated in front of everybody.</p>

  <p>After an awkward silence, Tianming said, "Zheng, don't worry. Master Yu is just worried about Yudie. It will take her around ten days to fly down the ascending passageway. When the time comes, we'll go find her together."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to go looking for her," Zheng said. "I will immediately know it if she returns to this great world."</p>

  <p>Zheng had every faith on the will of the great world and could detect everything that happened in this world. What really troubled him was his son's poor personality.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, arrangements were done for everyone to stay in Cloud Hall for the time being.</p>

  <p>Soon the news spread about Zheng's return to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Many warriors within the Central Region thronged to meet him. But Zheng had no mood to see any of them. He realized that his stay in the Lower World was not going to be so easy.</p>
