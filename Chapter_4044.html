</p>

  <p>As Zheng and the others approached, the expressions of disgust and greed of the members of the Wooden Leaf race slowly faded.</p>

  <p>They were replaced with flattering, welcoming smiles.</p>

  <p>One of the members, who was wrinkly and older, walked up towards the group and bowed down. "Welcome, my friends. You have traveled far."</p>

  <p>"This is our patriarch, Graham," Decker introduced.</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others nodded politely towards Graham.</p>

  <p>Graham and Decker then toured the group around the territory of the Wooden Leaf race.</p>

  <p>Their territory was made of densely packed caves that were in rows around the mountain.</p>

  <p>However, the caves were only half a person high, which was enough for a member of the Wooden Leaf race to merely enter and exit.</p>

  <p>For Zheng, Fuxi and the other regular human beings, the caves resembled kennels. They had to get on their knees and squeeze themselves through the caves.</p>

  <p>"These caves are way too small for us," Eastern Emperor Taiyi complained.</p>

  <p>"Even I can't get in easily!" King Ieuan squealed.</p>

  <p>Graham smiled and said, "These caves are for the short people like us to live in. Not to worry, there are larger caves above. Follow me."</p>

  <p>Zheng and the rest did not want to stay here, but they were overwhelmed by the hospitality of Graham, so they followed him.</p>

  <p>After they climbed up about a thousand feet from one side of the mountain road, a large cave appeared at the mountainside.</p>

  <p>The sun shone brightly against the entrance, revealing the cozy, dry interior of the cave. It was well maintained. A faint fragrance lingered within the cave, making it an above average temporary residence.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked around the cave and turned towards Graham. "Can this cave really resist hatred-level Treacherous Beings?"</p>

  <p>"The hatred-level Treacherous Beings?" Graham chuckled. "Though there is no place on the Night View Island that can absolutely resist hatred-level Treacherous Beings, our territory can guarantee your safety."</p>

  <p>Decker echoed, "Don't worry! The Wooden Leaf race has lived peacefully on the Night View Island for countless years."</p>

  <p>Zheng shot a look at Decker and said, "Well then, I assume this place will suffice."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Decker added with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other race on this island besides you?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>They wanted to have a clear understanding of the Night View Island through the members of the Wooden Leaf race. This was the main reason they followed Graham and Decker all the way.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Many races reside here. There are..." One by one, Decker mentioned the races without skipping a beat.</p>

  <p>"Are there humans among these races?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Humans?" Decker shrugged his shoulders. "You mean, those like you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Decker shook his head in response. "You must be from the Supreme Pure Realm. I for one, have never seen humans before."</p>

  <p>Though Decker denied it, Zheng noticed a hint of fear in his eyes when he'd mentioned "humans".</p>

  <p>"It's almost nightfall and we still have much to prepare. Please rest here and we'll talk about it tomorrow," said Graham.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, he pulled Decker away and they exited the cave, leaving Zheng and the others to themselves.</p>

  <p>Once they were out of sight, everyone's expression darkened.</p>

  <p>"I think Decker is lying. He seems to know the existence of the human race, and surely he has seen at least one human in his life," Fuxi pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Humans frighten him. I wonder why..." Eastern Emperor Taiyi scratched his head, confused.</p>

  <p>"They sure have shitty acting skills," King Ieuan mocked with a scoff.</p>

  <p>"Everything seems strange." Pearson sniffed and sneered, "Even the fragrance of the cave doesn't mask the stench of blood. This cave is probably a slaughterhouse."</p>

  <p>The rest sniffed and nodded. Indeed, they could smell the blood, too.</p>

  <p>The cave was wide from the outside but narrowed as it deepened. The entrance opened up to the sky, so it was most definitely not a good hiding spot.</p>

  <p>As she observed the cave further, the Snake Goddess concluded, "This should not be a slaughterhouse."</p>

  <p>"Then what is it?" Thurston eagerly asked. After all, the Snake Goddess was the smartest among the group.</p>

  <p>"The Wooden Leaf race is so bad at lying that their lies become evident. I guess when Decker saw us, he was caught off guard. Because they weren't prepared, he lured us in and they decided to keep us here first," the Snake Goddess deduced. "This cave might not be a slaughterhouse, but it's most likely a holding unit for their prey."</p>

  <p>"Might as well be a slaughterhouse," Pearson snorted.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Snake Goddess pointed towards the entrance. "Don't forget that both the sloth and Decker mentioned that monsters would descend from the sky. Now, think about this cave again."</p>

  <p>Zheng pondered on it for a while. "You mean to say that the Wooden Leaf race keeps their prey in this cave to somewhat offer them as sacrifices to the monsters from the sky?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so." The Snake Goddess nodded.</p>

  <p>"But why?" Sawyer asked.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess smiled. "It's simple. They want protection."</p>

  <p>The Wooden Leaf race didn't seem too powerful. They were at the bottom of the food chain in the Night View Island, so they had to be creative in coming up with ways of survival.</p>

  <p>"If they want protection, they should have lured in weaker beings. Keeping us hostage would do them more damage," Zheng said smugly.</p>

  <p>Zheng and his group were not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>If what they discovered was true, they would not hold back in taking revenge.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess thought for a while and added, "Perhaps if they offer stronger prey, they will be rewarded. Maybe that's why they took the risk."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded in agreement. "That seems reasonable. What should we do next?"</p>

  <p>"If this place is a trap, we need to leave as soon as possible," Yasamin pointed out.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess shook her head. "Though I may be right, the wildness might be more dangerous than here. I think we should stay put and figure out how to survive within the confines of this cave."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in a circular cave tucked away in the far right of their territory, Graham grunted in anger, "Why did you bring these people here? We have more than enough sacrifices! And besides, have you forgotten the miserable endings of the Thunder race and the White Bone race? Are you trying to get us all killed?"</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Wooden Leaf race, Graham was well-aware of that man's strength and capabilities.</p>

  <p>"These humans have nothing to do with that man. They are not strong enough and know nothing. If anything, they are the best sacrifices we can offer." A trace of malice washed over Decker's face.</p>

  <p>"If that man figures it out, our race will be wiped out," Graham said monotonously. He could already tell that this was going to be a mess they couldn't clean up.</p>

  <p>Decker was unmoved and replied with all confidence, "They don't know enough about the island, so they won't be able to live through one night.</p>

  <p>They will die tonight, and that man will never know."</p>

  <p>"But..." Graham trailed off, hesitant.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget about the Evil Tiger race from the north mountain. They will never let us go! We do this for the sake of our race's continuity," Decker said calmly.</p>

  <p>Graham was finally convinced. His face relaxed as he let out a heavy sigh.</p>

  <p>If the sacrifice went smoothly, it would be a great harvest for the Wooden Leaf race. It was worth the risk, and there was no going back.</p>
