  <p>
</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Luo Zheng was suspecting that he had fallen into some kind of illusion.</p>

  <p>He remembered coming down from the top of the cave, but why the hell were there so many monsters up there in the other cave?</p>

  <p>It was impossible for a huge cave to have formed in the gangue layer above him in such a short time. He couldn't figure out what had really happened.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, watch out! Down there!" Master Evil was shouting at him in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had also sensed Luo Zheng's fall into depression and the reason behind it.</p>

  <p>Whoever encountered such a situation would wonder if he had lost his mind.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was just as shocked, but he only had a soul fragment left and wasn't as nervous as Luo Luo Zheng. The scene before him was absolutely absurd, but he hoped that Luo Luo Zheng would find a way out.</p>

  <p>Since the cave appeared above Luo Zheng's head out of nowhere, Master Evil thought Luo Luo Zheng could switch directions and find another way out, so he asked Luo Luo Zheng to create a path from below.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed as he focused on keeping his composure.</p>

  <p>He was quick to pull himself together, thanks to his change in mentality.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Luo Zheng had moved along the path of martial arts rather smoothly as he aimed to grow stronger. His confidence was like the sun that had just risen in the morning. With his passion for martial arts alone, he seemed capable of defeating anything in his path.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng had grown more cautious and sensitive to his environment? the divine land was a different territory, so he merely had to adjust his mindset to face it.</p>

  <p>After Master Evil's warning, a strong instinct for survival rose in Luo Zheng's heart. Even if the way he previously entered was gone, he had to do anything he could to find another way out? anything was better than being trapped there.</p>

  <p>The arms around the cave were getting closer to him and the dark shadows could emerge from the walls at any minute. Simultaneously, the huge heads above his head also came down from the crack.</p>

  <p>"Ripping Consciousness?"</p>

  <p>In this situation, any negative emotion could put Luo Luo Zheng to death. Once again, he suppressed his emotions with his swordsmanship comprehension while at the same time employing the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>With a flip of his right hand, he thrust the sword downwards abruptly and backed up. The sword intent from the Great Weighty Sword cut a hole right into the ground and the coal-black gangue on the cave's surface turned dark green.</p>

  <p>Looking into the hole, he was surprised to see black pieces of gangue at the other end, but these ones were not as hard or tough as the green ones in the cave he was in.</p>

  <p>"Finally, things are back to normal!" Luo Luo Zheng was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>When he was immersed in the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, there had to be no trace of any emotion fluctuations in his mind, but he had yet to cultivate this Divine Dao to perfection. When he saw the black gangue, he felt he had found a way out and his soul, which should have been emotionless, grew a tad excited.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng went all out. With his powerful physical strength, he launched the Gods-intimidating Strike which could pierce a passageway over a hundred feet long. With only three to four strikes, he had created a path about five to six hundred feet deep downward.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Luo Zheng let himself fall straight down the hole like a long wooden stick.</p>

  <p>As he fell, he heard a burst of thick footsteps? the giant black shadows wandering in the walls finally emerged, but he didn't have the time to take a look and figure out what the giant shadows were before falling into the passageway. When he raised his head again, dozens of arms stretching out came into view as they filled the passageway.</p>

  <p>After a quick glimpse, he lowered back his head and continued digging downwards. After making it about four or five thousand feet down, he raised his head and saw that the other end of the hole above him had become a blurry speck. With his magic eyesight, he could see the arms still tightly stuck at the entrance.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Luo Zheng sigh in relief. It seemed that the creatures couldn't leave the cave, so Luo Luo Zheng halted the Ripping Consciousness.</p>

  <p>Though he didn't know what happened around the cave, he figured that he had dug directly down the big crater of the Tie Clan. And after going through the cave, he had dug several thousand feet deeper down.</p>

  <p>It was no longer realistic for him to keep going down as there seemed to be many strange creatures and happenings in the underground divine land. Who knew what else he might have dug out?</p>

  <p>After discussing the matter with Master Evil in his head for a moment, Luo Luo Zheng decided to start digging forward? though the cave above him was by no means small, he could avoid it if he kept digging horizontally.</p>

  <p>With his Great Weighty Sword, he managed to create a ten thousand-foot long passageway. At this point, Luo Luo Zheng changed direction once again and began digging upwards.</p>

  <p>To build such a long passage in the gangue layer was too much labor for even a mid-rank True God. But Luo Luo Zheng had unparalleled strength. If it were some ordinary low-rank True God caught in such a situation, they might not manage to break through the thick layer of gangue.</p>

  <p>Carefully, Luo Luo Zheng continued digging upward, afraid of finding his way into the previous cave again.</p>

  <p>Along the way, he and Master Evil analyzed the situation he had encountered a while ago. They arrived at the conclusion that the weird cave had been displaced, but they couldn't figure out how it moved in the layer of gangue.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he was able to make it out of there safely. And more importantly, he got six pieces of mud? five of them were about the same size as what the Tie Clan had sold to him and the middle-most piece was four or five times larger than the others.</p>

  <p>In addition, he had also caught an eyeball, though he could only find time to examine it further after making it back.</p>

  <p>Keeping his vigilance, he continued to dig diagonally upward. He wasn't going too fast? after about eight hours of digging, he suddenly felt the obstruction before his sword weaken. The sound of gravel rubbing came from behind the wall.</p>

  <p>"I am leaving the gangue layer!" Luo Zheng's eyes lit up? ordinary soil lay before him now, meaning he had finally bypassed the cave.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes of digging through soil, he felt wetness nearing the surface. The moment he got through the soil layer, turbulent water flowed down from above? he had dug himself out and into a pond.</p>

  <p>It was within a small courtyard of the Tie Clan. Within the Six-Burden Divine City, the Tie Clan was rather insignificant, but since it had been running a business there for so many years, it was still considered somewhat superior to the ordinary clans. Its entire house occupied a large area of land, built in a unique fashion.</p>

  <p>Several maidservants in the courtyard saw a sudden whirl in the middle of the pond, piquing their curiosity. The water sank so quickly down Luo Zheng's passage. Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng appeared in the middle of the pond, drenched. The sight earned screams of shock from the Tie Clan maids.</p>

  <p>After the commotion, Luo Luo Zheng was led back to the main hall.</p>

  <p>Devin's uncles were utterly puzzled and were eager to know what exactly happened.</p>

  <p>Not only did they fail to find Luo Luo Zheng, they had no idea how he left. The huge crater was still rather far from the clan. A few hours after Luo Luo Zheng disappeared, he appeared in their pond, much to their surprise. It was all too strange.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't tell them the truth? if he had only dug out a few pieces of mud underground, it wouldn't have been necessary for him to lie, but when he found the weird cave and saw the man and woman on the stone, he knew that it was no simple matter. He figured it would be wiser to avoid revealing anything.</p>

  <p>He told the clan that he found something strange as he dug along the way, but couldn't find a way back and dug randomly into the ground.</p>

  <p>After a few hours, he just managed to find a way out and accidentally found himself in the clan's pond.</p>

  <p>The elders didn't respond well to Luo Zheng's story? they weren't convinced in the least. After Luo Luo Zheng left, they already made up their minds to send people down the passageway Luo Luo Zheng created and explore it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, of course, was well aware of this plan, but it was hard to say whether or not they were able to find the strange cave. Based on what happened, Luo Luo Zheng was certain that the cave could move. Perhaps that was why no one had discovered the cave for so long.</p>
