<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Mike let out a sigh. Luo Zheng's face lit up with a smile as he bowed to Mike and said, "Believe in me, Father!"</p>

  <p>His eyes shone with unprecedented confidence, as if he was ready to overcome literally any problem.</p>

  <p>Ever since Mike had been a Holy Being himself, he naturally understood all the hardships that came along with it. However, he thought that Luo Zheng's enthusiasm was childish--he was like a newborn calf who wanted to fight a grown tiger.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng's resplendent Mu Ning encouraged and comforted him.</p>

  <p>And so, he decided to concede. "Alright. Now, I'll teach you how to construct your inner world," he said with a nod.</p>

  <p>He knew that to let Luo Luo Zheng cultivate the 'Primal Chaos Technique' was immensely risky and not to mention, insane.</p>

  <p>After all, no one had ever tried to transform their body in such a way before. No one had even attempted to contain the chaos inside their bodies.</p>

  <p>Mike and Bromley had previously fought over the matter, and Mike thought that it was unnecessary to take the risk.</p>

  <p>Instead, he wanted Luo Luo Zheng to focus on the life vitality cultivation. Besides, the life vitality cultivation that was passed down in the divine land was already a very mature system.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they were Holy Beings, which meant they had already reached the peak of the life vitality cultivation.</p>

  <p>Mike, Bromley, and Jay had given their all to nurture Luo Luo Zheng. In turn, Luo Luo Zheng felt privileged to receive such a treatment that he thought was hard to come by.</p>

  <p>But at that time, Bromley and Mike had completely different opinions.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen a Holy Being's son become a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>Bromley once said.</p>

  <p>His words had made Mike speechless.</p>

  <p>Countless divine eras had passed, Holy Beings had died, and their universes had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter whether it were the existing or dead Holy Beings; a second Holy Being never appeared among their direct descendants.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng wanted to fight against Murphy, he had to aim for becoming a Holy Being. However, Bromley felt that the probability was too low despite Luo Zheng's and Yan's extraordinary origins. The road to becoming a Holy Being was not easy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mike had low chances of saving himself and enacting his revenge if Luo Luo Zheng were to concentrate on the life vitality cultivation.</p>

  <p>During that time, Holy Jay was on Bromley's side. Holy Jay was good at deduction, so he already came up with an answer after he had deduced Mike's plan. If Luo Luo Zheng cultivated the life vitality step by step, the chances of him creating a miracle were less than one in three hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>The chances weren't actually too low. Only one in a hundred trillion or even a quadrillion martial artists had the possibility of becoming a Holy Being. Every Holy Being was the absolute favorite of the divine land.</p>

  <p>They had endured many hardships and suffering just to get the opportunity to make a place in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Therefore, a one in a three hundred thousand chance was indeed, not low. It was because of Luo Zheng's special origins and not to mention, that he had been carefully taught by the Holy Beings themselves.</p>

  <p>Even during the time when Holy Jay had done his deduction, he had already taken all of these conditions into consideration.</p>

  <p>However, there was a catch: Mike only had one chance to save himself.</p>

  <p>Once the layout had started, it couldn't be stopped.</p>

  <p>From this point of view, his hopes were a little too slim.</p>

  <p>It was why Bromley and Holy Jay stood on the same side. If they wanted to save Mike and create a miracle, they could only take the risk because that was the only way to create a miracle.</p>

  <p>The result was what they had ended up with now.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that Luo Luo Zheng had lived up to everyone's expectations. He had created his own path in the cultivation of chaotic energy. Nobody knew what more could he achieve in the future; but by the looks of it, it seemed that he would be quite successful.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, not even the extremely intelligent Bromley could predict how far the chaos energy cultivation would evolve. In reality, if the Primal Chaos Technique was compared with the life vitality cultivation methods, it was only considered as a "beginning-level" life vitality cultivation method.</p>

  <p>He had only taught Luo Luo Zheng how to open up the chaotic sea and how to control the chaotic energy. As for how to use the chaotic energy and how to build his own world, Luo Luo Zheng had explored those all by himself.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, all the methods that Luo Luo Zheng had tried were correct. At the very least, his inner world had expanded to a considerable degree.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, what he had made was a true world that was on par with the divine land. The life forms in his world were not created from the life vitality, but rather constructed from chaos.</p>

  <p>What puzzled Luo Luo Zheng now was how to further expand and construct the inner world. He didn't have any of the experiences of his predecessors, so he could only struggle and find things out by himself.</p>

  <p>Thus, who could better help him other than the creator of the universe himself, Mike? After all, he had a much better understanding of the inner world than the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded at his father without the slightest bit of hesitation. Besides, he still had many doubts about the inner world that he had created.</p>

  <p>Some time after Luo Zheng's inner world had expanded, he had started to secretly conduct some experiments.</p>

  <p>For instance, he took out the fish from the inner world, and the fish didn't disappear. According to the classification standard, all creatures formed from chaos should be considered ordinary creatures. In other words, they were technically qualified to live in the divine land, and not to be restricted by the heavens.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did another experiment after that; he caught a low-level ferocious beast, the Fire Poisonous Crab, and placed it in his inner world.</p>

  <p>It did come with the fact that Luo Luo Zheng still felt uncomfortable at casually placing a creature in his inner world. However, something strange happened the moment the low-level Fire Poisonous Crab was placed into his inner world.</p>

  <p>He felt that his inner world was sort of rejecting it. It became a whole and altogether refused the Fire Poisonous Crab's entry. It was followed by cracks that started to appear on the Fire Poisonous Crab's surface, which made its hard shell become fragile. Soon enough, its shell shattered.</p>

  <p>The Fire Poisonous Crab was broken into large pieces at first, then the pieces turned into small specks of dust, until the dust particles dissipated into a cloud of dirt.</p>

  <p>In the end, not even a speck of dust was left behind. What was once the Fire Poisonous Crab had turned into a faint trace of life vitality and dissolved into Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a martial artist could place creatures in their inner world after they had opened it. Some Holy Beings even had their own family members living in their inner worlds. However, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't do that in his own. Entering his inner world was the same as entering the divine land; the only result of forcefully crossing the heavens was that they would be disintegrated and be restored to the life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Don't resist and bring me into your inner world with you," said Mike.</p>

  <p>As soon as Mike approached him, Luo Luo Zheng sent his father's energy soul into his own inner world as he simultaneously summoned an incarnation in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Mike was a Holy Being in the divine land, so he naturally wouldn't be rejected like the Fire Poisonous Crab when he entered Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long until Mike's energy soul had now floated high up in the sky. He looked at the nine large stars and couldn't help but exclaim,</p>

  <p>"You're only at the world lord level, yet you managed to build the Nine Divine Stars in your inner world. It's truly a miracle!"</p>

  <p>It was known that after some True Gods had activated the Nine Divine Stars, those nine stars would float above their cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>In the belly of a True God who was a body refiner, only nine beads flickered; and those were the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>However, True Gods weren't qualified to integrate nine stars into their inner worlds. Only when some of the top True Gods had constructed the universes and become Holy Beings, could their inner worlds and Nine Divine Stars be merged together.</p>

  <p>Mike had experienced this and knew how difficult it was to merge the nine stars into one's inner world.</p>

  <p>Yet there was Luo Luo Zheng, who was just at the world lord level but had already merged the two together. If this had happened in the divine land, many True Gods would probably go crazy; it was simply too unbelievable.</p>

  <p>It was true that it was risky to cultivate the Primal Chaos Technique, but now Mike thought that it was a wise idea. He mentally sighed. He couldn't even imagine how much potential his son had.</p>

  <p>A moment later, he and Luo Luo Zheng glided towards the bottom of the inner world. The Mu Ning in the place was completely different from that of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng himself wasn't aware of the uniqueness of this Mu Ning, Mike clearly knew about it. It was the scent of the divine land.</p>

  <p>In reality, the entire divine land was actually formed from chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>It was just that the living beings in the divine land had to explore other ways of cultivation because they couldn't control chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they developed the complete system of the life vitality cultivation.</p>

  <p>"This place can really be called a small divine land," Mike said as he looked at the world they were in. As he looked further into the inner world Luo Luo Zheng had created, he felt that Bromley and Jay had made the right choice. These two crazy old friends of his had suggested a crazy plan, which allowed his son to find a path that no one had ever walked before.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had a certain level of understanding towards the divine land, so he naturally understood Mike's meaning. Suddenly, a thought popped in his head. He bowed towards Mike and said, "Father, something strange happened within my inner world after I stepped into the level of world lord."</p>

  <p>"Oh? What's the strange thing?" Mike asked. "Follow me and you will know."</p>

  <p>His feet glided smoothly as he led the way, while Mike followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, they arrived at the edge of the world they were in.</p>
