<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Tower of Sin had a total of fifteen floors with a Talent Tablet located on the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's assumption was right; this tower served the same function as the Dragon Soar Arena and was very likely to have been used by some race for training. The Tower of Sin was like a hundred times scaled-up version of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>As for whether or not it could also send people to the Upper World, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>He and Olivia walked at the front, followed by a few human war generals and creatures from other races.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone was curious about Luo Zheng's talent and would naturally not miss an opportunity such as this.</p>

  <p>There was a huge space not far away from the arena. It should be a living area if the structure of this floor was the same as the others. But this floor was different with a large wall being its most prominent feature.</p>

  <p>There were quite a few names engraved on the wall in front of Luo Luo Zheng, arranged from top to bottom.</p>

  <p>He scanned through them and soon found the name "Olivia Xia" listed in the sixth row.</p>

  <p>He looked back at Olivia and asked, "These names are??"</p>

  <p>She gave him a smile. "These are the names of all talents that have been tested by the Talent Tablet."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows rose at the information and now looked at the names with concentration.</p>

  <p>Olivia was a talent from the Purple Heart Sacred Place and even though the sacred place itself was weak, it still had a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the sacred place could be considered significantly stronger than the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Back in the Central Region, there hadn't been a single sacred place that had appeared. Even the Ethereal Spirit Sect was only a fifth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>From this fact alone, one could surmise that Olivia's talent was a little stronger than Brent's.</p>

  <p>How was it possible that Olivia was only ranked in the sixth row?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face was the epitome of astonishment and perplexity.</p>

  <p>The sixth row was densely packed with names, so Luo Luo Zheng moved on and looked at the countless names above the sixth row. Each of these creatures had a better talent than Olivia.</p>

  <p>"Boris! The fourth row!" And it indeed was.</p>

  <p>Olivia thankfully explained, "In the history of our Sea God Continent, only six names have ever appeared in the fourth row. Two of them are on the tenth floor; one is Boris, who is an ogre, and the other is Cheryl of the Demon Night."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in understanding. From the looks of it, Boris' strength would probably surpass Luo Zheng's despite being a level ten war general.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was once again faced with another question. If there were only six creatures on the Sea God Continent that had appeared in the fourth row, then where did these other creatures above it come from?</p>

  <p>An answer suddenly popped in his head. The Tower of Sin was definitely not from the Lower World. Maybe it had belonged to humans, or maybe another entirely different race. Nevertheless, whoever it belonged to must've come from the Upper World. That was the only explanation he could think of since there would be impossible to have so many talents above the divine level on the wall had it been from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>"In all the years the Sea God Continent has existed, no one from the continent has ever appeared above the fourth row?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Olivia pouted thoughtfully before her eyes brightened. "There is someone!" she exclaimed. "Look at the first name in the second row? Amber, a super talent of the Demon Night. She appeared on the Talent Table two hundred years ago."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze immediately shifted to where she was pointing and there was, indeed, Amber's name.</p>

  <p>The names were arranged in the order in which they had appeared. Boris was ranked first in the fourth row while Cheryl was ranked second since both of them had not been in the Tower of Sin for long and naturally passed the Talent Tablet's test not too long ago.</p>

  <p>As for Amber, after such a great talent appeared, there might've been no one who followed to surpass her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wondered exactly how many creatures entered the tower every year. So many talents from different races were sent to the Tower of Sin, and to be able to climb up to the tenth floor, one would have to at least be a heaven-level, saint-level, or even a divine-level talent.</p>

  <p>But, up until now, only Amber had managed to get herself listed in the second row while Boris and Cheryl were down in the fourth row.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to look up and read the names in the first row.</p>

  <p>"Abigail Yun!"</p>

  <p>"Odom Gu!"</p>

  <p>"Cliff!"</p>

  <p>"Fire!"</p>

  <p>"Norwood!"</p>

  <p>The first two names were likely from humans, but Luo Luo Zheng couldn't be too sure.</p>

  <p>There were creatures from other races that had the same surname.</p>

  <p>As for the others, however, the names were somewhat strange and sounded more like nicknames.</p>

  <p>There were only these five names occupying the first row.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin had existed for so many years and had perhaps been originally used by a large race in the Upper World. Yet there were only five names that were carved in the first row.</p>

  <p>How terrifying were the talents of these five people?</p>

  <p>"Why is Yolande's name not here?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>"Simple. She's never been in here before," Olivia explained directly.</p>

  <p>Yolande had been standing not far from the crowd and was looking up the ceiling with a dazed expression on her face. Nobody knew what this mysterious girl was thinking about at that moment.</p>

  <p>Olivia hadn't expected her to hear her. It took both her and Luo Luo Zheng by surprise when Yolande went towards them, her clogs clacking as she walked. "A test doesn't sound too bad," she said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Her words had everyone look at her strangely.</p>

  <p>Yolande was a mystery to both humans and other races. She was a valiant girl who had long since surpassed the definition of "talent," but her strange actions all puzzled the other creatures.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, humans benefited from her a lot with the Lucky Light she kept giving away for free. This made her a target for assassination by the ogres who didn't like the free pass she gave to others.</p>

  <p>All three assassinations failed, as expected. She was simply an invincible force on the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, she chose to stay on her floor. Otherwise, it would've posed a bigger problem for the ogres.</p>

  <p>Everyone was intrigued and had started discussing among themselves just what kind of talent Yolande had. They all wanted to know the test result.</p>

  <p>A lot of humans had tried to persuade Yolande to accept the Talent Tablet's trial partly because of curiosity, but also because the Talent Tablet had the ability to somehow enhance one's talent for a tiny bit. This was the reason why the Talent Tablet was a must-see for every warrior that entered the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>But of course, Yolande was not like every warrior. She didn't listen to any race, and certainly not to humans. The human leaders were afraid of offending her so they just let her do whatever she wanted.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought that she would suddenly change her mind and enter the Talent Tablet?</p>

  <p>Olivia's gentle eyes flashed with a strange expression. No doubt she was also thinking why Yolande had changed her mind. Was it because of Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>There must be a connection.</p>

  <p>She had never heard Yolande comment on other people's scents before.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she often did not sport any expression on her face and looked like a puppet most of the time. If she didn't need to eat, she would be described as a walking dead.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng extended his hand and smiled, "You go first then."</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't need to be told twice but, before she went in, she moved close to Luo Zheng's collar and sniffed. Her face showed a trace of satisfaction before she turned around and went through the door.</p>

  <p>After walking in, the entire wall suddenly began to tremble before the door closed naturally.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take for the test to finish?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Olivia shrugged, "It depends. Sometimes five minutes, other times two hours."</p>

  <p>The wall started emitting rays of light and the countless names started to flash. Soon, what they'd all been waiting for appeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression froze. "The last row?"</p>

  <p>Yolande's name had made its appearance and it was in the very bottom row.</p>
