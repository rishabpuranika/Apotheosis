<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1554 Death Chain (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Lucille's repetitive attacks were becoming much more skillful, and definitely more ferocious!</p>

  <p>She had specially focused her attacks on Luo Zheng's vital parts, and every move of hers could kill him. At the speed of light, she slashed and cut at his eyes, throat and abdomen, hoping to blind, decapitate and disembowel him.</p>

  <p>It was because Luo Zheng's ability to predict danger was so extremely accurate that he could always avoid the most serious injuries at the last critical moment, but the wounds on his body had still continued to increase! She was slicing him up bit by bit.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Another golden wind gathered momentum and swept over!</p>

  <p>A murderous smile appeared on Lucille's face and there was a twinkle of expectation in her dark eyes now.</p>

  <p>She had found an unexpected flaw in Luo Zheng's defenses, and after this attack, she would be able to end his life!</p>

  <p>Being in a stalemate with this insignificant person for so long had forced her to use the Crescent Blade, and Lucille couldn't help but sigh in her heart that this universe was truly marvelous. It was a wonder that such a powerful yet insignificant person had shown up from nowhere, while she had not noticed him at all. She then realized that earlier she had underestimated the difficulty of the Illusion Battlefield. This display of prowess had been both entertaining and challenging and Lucille was feeling contented at this opportunity to really display her talents.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>This time, her attack missed Luo Luo Zheng. The warriors on the wall gasped in puzzlement and looked at each other with confused faces. How could Lucille miss?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had deliberately shown that flaw.</p>

  <p>Lucille did not care overly much that she had missed in her attack on him. This kind of duplicitous action could only be described as boring trickery in her eyes. She only valued strength and skill, not deception.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng was, in her opinion, destined to be unable to catch her, she might as well repeat the attack a few more times. With a flash of the golden wind, she planned to avoid any possible retaliation from him again.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, a chain appeared in Luo Zheng's hand!</p>

  <p>It was a bright silver chain that looked shiny and new. However, when Lucille focused on the chain, a hint of doubt flashed on her face.</p>

  <p>Something was not as it appeared here, but she could not figure it out.</p>

  <p>'What is this guy planning to do?</p>

  <p>Does he want to use this chain to lock me? Is that even possible?'</p>

  <p>However, as this thought appeared in her mind she began to draw into the golden wind, preparing to quickly step through the distance between her and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>While she was busy gathering her strength, one end of the chain had suddenly turned into a silver ribbon of light, and it instantly spread towards Lucille. This end of the chain suddenly locked onto her foot at a speed that exceeded Lucille's imagination! She was caught!</p>

  <p>The other end was locked onto Luo Luo Zheng! He had her tethered to him!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Lucille immediately became anxious and she began to pull at the chain, hoping to find a way to escape this bond.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard she tried, she could not figure out how this chain could have been so fast. How had it attached itself to her with such speed? Why couldn't she escape using the profound mysteries of the Wind Law? It was a talent that she had always relied on, and it had never failed her, until now!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Her figure was still flashing crazily as she tried to beat a retreat!</p>

  <p>However, no matter how hard Lucille tried to escape, she was unable to throw off the chain on her foot. Despite flashing, she simply appeared next to Luo Luo Zheng again and again.</p>

  <p>She was like a tied up bird. No matter how she spread her wings to soar into the sky, she could only fly to the end of the chain and would then be pulled back to her original position. She was leashed!</p>

  <p>Lucille naturally couldn't have imagined that Luo Zheng's Death Chain would even be able to lock down a Supreme Lord. Although she was an ace talent of the Ji Clan, her strength couldn't be stronger than a Supreme Lord's, could it?</p>

  <p>This Death Chain had been obtained from the few pieces that Luo Zheng's master had bestowed upon him. He had been waiting for an opportunity to test it, and now he had been able to successfully tether an ace talent!</p>

  <p>The formidable weapon could be considered a mini version of the Desperate Melee!</p>

  <p>The Desperate Melee could lock dozens of people together, and only one would survive!</p>

  <p>As for the Death Chain in Luo Zheng's hands, it could lock the user together with his opponent. After being locked by the Death Chain, the two of them only had one option for escape, and that was to kill the other one!</p>

  <p>If the opponent's strength was greater than Luo Zheng's, then using the Death Chain was absolutely courting his own death. It would bring a dangerous foe within reach and there was no space to dodge or hide from attacks now.</p>

  <p>However, the Death Chain belonged to Luo Luo Zheng after all. He was the one who had to choose to lock or not, and could lock whoever he wanted!</p>

  <p>This Lucille in front of him was surprisingly fast. Luo Luo Zheng had dodged and retreated while pondering on how to break the situation, then he suddenly remembered that he still had this magic weapon and he wondered if it would work. He had actually never used it before!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Streaks of golden wind were flashing.</p>

  <p>Lucille's silhouette kept appearing and disappearing in the golden wind.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how much she struggled, she couldn't get more than ten feet away from Luo Luo Zheng as the chain held her locked in place.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast she was, she still couldn't break free from this chain.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng looked miserable with his multitude of bloody cuts, he knew that he had already won when the Death Chain had locked onto Lucille!</p>

  <p>The Death Chain could only extend a distance of ten feet. With a slight tug from Luo Luo Zheng, Lucille was yanked back by Luo Zheng's immense power.</p>

  <p>Realizing that she was unable to escape from his chain, a determined look appeared on Lucille's face. She no longer struggled meaninglessly; instead, she once again drained all of the life vitality in her body.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the brilliant luster of the Five-element Finger Chain, the life vitality turned into a five-colored palm print and rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng with murderous intent!</p>
