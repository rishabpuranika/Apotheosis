<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1480 Suicide </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Salvador's eyes softened as he saw Xun, and he withdrew the long spear that he'd been holding and intending to stab her with.</p>

  <p>The four people who had been attacking the Reincarnation Plate paused at the same time.</p>

  <p>Xun gently flapped her wings and descended slowly to stand behind the Reincarnation Plate, fixing a stoical gaze on the four people in front of her. "Why did you stop?"</p>

  <p>The four of them remained silent.</p>

  <p>They had been through an excruciating ordeal, having chased the Incarnation Plate all the way here.</p>

  <p>They had battle of contradicting emotions going in their hearts during the chase. The enormous Reincarnation Plate was just a buffer.</p>

  <p>They knew they could smash it. But what would happen next?</p>

  <p>Would they really kill Xun?</p>

  <p>The four of them glanced at each other, despair filling their eyes.</p>

  <p>Xun understood their expressions and their situation. She smiled what could only be an indifferent yet dangerous smile as she gently waved the long spear in her hands. "Who will make the first move?"</p>

  <p>None of the four moved.</p>

  <p>Xun was strong enough to use Faith Energy but was still too weak to fight them.</p>

  <p>With their strength, they could kill her in an instant.</p>

  <p>But the four of them were stiff as statues as they flew behind the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>Not a single one of them charged forward.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate flew through space, the two sides in a strange kind of stalemate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, ringing laughter resounded in the universe once again. Yao's voice.</p>

  <p>"If you don't do it, I will! The Punishment of Eternal Night has not been used in a long time!"</p>

  <p>The faces of the four darkened at Yao's declaration.</p>

  <p>The Punishment of Eternal Night was one of the cruelest punishments of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>If Yao used it to punish them, their clans would suffer the most and die.</p>

  <p>The pain of the physical body wasn't the point. In fact, in the Punishment of Eternal Night, the souls of their clansmen would be extracted and placed in a Demon Night's soul prison, in which there was no life or death; only eternal torture.</p>

  <p>Usually, only the most sinful traitors of the Demon Night were punished with Punishment of Eternal Night.</p>

  <p>But now, it was going to be used on their loved ones.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you guys five minutes to think about it. After that, you won't have a choice." Yao's voice dripped sweetness, and it was obvious she was enjoying this moment the most.</p>

  <p>Once Yao's words had faded out, Salvador rushed towards the end of the Reincarnation Plate where Xun was standing.</p>

  <p>Rays of spear intents gathered together at the spear in Xun's hands.</p>

  <p>She used the same spear art as Salvador did, but despite the Faith Energy she was using, her attack had less than a tenth of the power that Salvador's had.</p>

  <p>But she did not retreat, her face betraying no emotion.</p>

  <p>Salvador threw his long spear aside as he charged towards Xun.</p>

  <p>His entire body slammed into the Cold Plum Blood Spear she was holding.</p>

  <p>The tip of the spear drilled into his chest, passing through his back.</p>

  <p>Under the immense impact, his body slid down the spear shaft towards Xun's side, blood flowing along the spear and falling on her hand.</p>

  <p>Xun panicked, staring blankly at Salvador's face that was even more beautiful than a woman's.</p>

  <p>She opened her mouth, but didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>A swooshing sound alerted her to the presence of another figure that had dashed over. Aneisha!</p>

  <p>Xun turned the spearhead as she saw this. She knew what Aneisha was about to do.</p>

  <p>But Salvador gripped the spear that had pierced through his heart so forcefully that Xun was rendered unable to move.</p>

  <p>Another swoosh sounded, and Aneisha also thrust her body onto the long spear.</p>

  <p>Viveca and Elspeth followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>The four of them looked resolute.</p>

  <p>The nine-foot-nine-inch-long Cold Plum Blood Spear was crowded with the four warriors' bodies.</p>

  <p>Xun's jaw dropped as she stared at the four people on her spear. But she could not say a single word.</p>

  <p>Salvador then released the shaft of the Cold Plum Blood Spear, a dejected smile on his lips. He raised his head to look at Xun, and said with sadness, "My queen... May I call you by your name?"</p>

  <p>Xun nodded blankly.</p>

  <p>"Xun, I...I... Actually, I..." A blush crept up on Salvador's beautiful face at this.</p>

  <p>He couldn't finish his sentence even after fumbling over his words for a long, long time.</p>

  <p>"Salvador likes you, my queen," Aneisha, who was behind Salvador, blurted out.</p>

  <p>Although the queens of the Demon Night held a supreme position, they were not allowed to marry anyone from the Demon Night. This was because the throne was not allowed to be passed down to their next generation. After the queen died, a new leader would be chosen from the Demon Night. Only the purest of the Demon Night martial artists could be chosen to succeed to the throne.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded blankly once again. "I got it."</p>

  <p>"Do you still remember the South Heaven Ferry? We had just broken through to the Life and Death Realm and were training at the South Heaven Ferry. I put something very interesting there. If you would go there again, I hope you will find it. May my queen soar once more!"</p>

  <p>"May my queen soar once again!"</p>

  <p>"May my queen soar once again!"</p>

  <p>"May my queen..."</p>

  <p>Once they had finished speaking, muffled sounds came from within their bodies.</p>

  <p>They had forcefully disintegrated their inner worlds!</p>

  <p>The inner world at their level was already very rich. There were tens of thousands of lives in it as well, and there were even warriors at the Life and Death Realm and the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>When an inner world collapsed, it was like the collapse of the heavens in the universe. All life would go extinct. The Life and Death Realm warriors, Soul Sea Realm warriors, and all kinds of fierce beasts would all go extinct at the same time without a chance to resist. This was the law of the inner world.</p>

  <p>The moment their inner worlds fell apart, Viveca, Elspeth, Salvador, and Aneisha stopped showing any sign of life.</p>

  <p>Xun loosened her grip on the Cold Plum Blood Spear and retreated a few steps. The four of them were still in a standing position, their eyes wide open as they stared at her with smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>Feeling utterly powerless, she fell to her knees with a thud.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Luo Zheng, Freya, and Livingston heard a loud howl, like an enraged female leopard that had just lost its cub.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng retreated from the messy pile of divine textures. Now that nobody was chasing after him, he let the Reincarnation Plate fly freely in the universe. He opened an exit and arrived at the end of the plate.</p>

  <p>He saw Xun sitting there alone, four dead powerhouses standing lifelessly before her, pierced through by the Cold Plum Blood Spear.</p>

  <p>All of these four had the strength to traverse the universe, and they were more powerful than many grand world lords. Even their corpses emitted a powerful Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng floated over to stand silently behind Xun.</p>

  <p>She was his sword spirit, and he and she had always been one. Even though he stood behind her and did not see her sorrowful expression, he could still feel her pain.</p>

  <p>The four of them were probably facing a deathtrap, already having prepared this plan in their hearts.</p>

  <p>They didn't want to kill their queen.</p>

  <p>But disobeying Yao's orders meant that they had to watch their own family members, relatives, and clans suffer in Punishment of Eternal Night, which was something they weren't willing to see.</p>

  <p>In this kind of conflict, they could only choose to die by Xun's spear. Only by committing suicide like this could it not be considered as disobeying Yao's will.</p>

  <p>"Xun, get up," Luo Luo Zheng suddenly said.</p>

  <p>She didn't move.</p>

  <p>"Get up!"</p>

  <p>Xun still did not move.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng began to control his sword spirit with a single thought. Thanks to this, Xun's body started to float off the ground.</p>

  <p>She was the body of Luo Zheng's sword spirit, and he could control her on his own. But after Xun's soul took over the sword spirit's body, it was usually controlled by her.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's control, Xun floated in the air, looking at him, her eyes lacking the vigor they had in the past.</p>
