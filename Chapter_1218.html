  <p>
</p>

  <p>Max was very sure that the girl in front of him couldn't have obtained the title of golden Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they, a group of martial artists from the Upper World, were arrogant and looked down on the creatures that came from the great world of the Lower World.</p>

  <p>In truth, there were numerous creatures in the millions of great worlds and there were also many martial artists that had ascended to the Upper World by showing great talent and a strong warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>There were many creatures that had made extraordinary achievements after they ascended to the Upper World. Some of them had even become world lords or Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>But, generally speaking, there was a great disparity between the martial artists of the Lower World and those of the Upper World. And such disparity meant that the warriors' martial arts cultivation in the Lower World were greatly restricted since the time they were born. Restrictions existed everywhere.</p>

  <p>For instance, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the Upper World was much more violent than that in the Lower World. The creatures that nurtured by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the Upper World were stronger than those nurtured by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>In addition, there was also great disparity in resources, inheritances, and more between the Upper World and the Lower World.</p>

  <p>For this reason, they couldn't believe what Dorothea said.</p>

  <p>"Dorothea, don't forget the most important point. This woman said that she gained the recognition of the Celestial Position but I couldn't sense the existence of the mark of our Celestial Position on her. She's lying!"</p>

  <p>Delroy said again.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes flashed. They were so shocked by Dorothea's words that they forgot about what was truly important.</p>

  <p>To be acknowledged by the Celestial Position, one had to have his or her name on or above the second row of the Talent Tablet. If a person reached that level, the Talent Tablet would secretly put the mark of the Celestial Position on his or her body.</p>

  <p>Right now, they couldn't sense the mark on the woman's body. This meant that the woman was either lying, or had indeed entered the Talent Tablet and taken the test, but failed to have her name reach even the second row.</p>

  <p>Dorothea nodded. "Yes, I didn't sense the mark on her body either.</p>

  <p>However, the physical body isn't hers to begin with, the person inside simply took over it." Dorothea wavered in her belief after everyone offered their opinion in denial. Even though all facts supported her guess, she now felt that the absence of the mark was suspicious. Without it, the woman in front of her couldn't possibly hold the title of the golden Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>"We can easily verify this. We just need to find the real body of the soul inside her and take a look. It's an easy job." The tall and sturdy man laughed. "It will not be easy to pose as a Celestial Position warrior."</p>

  <p>Zheng still hadn't said a single word. It was unrealistic for him to fight against the seven powerful warriors of the Spirit Supreme Realm by himself, not to mention that he was now in the physical body of Brianna.</p>

  <p>Even if Brianna's soul hadn't been sealed, and she could use all her strength, she still wouldn't be able to fight against the seven powerful masters in front of them.</p>

  <p>A master at the Spirit Supreme Realm could pulverize anything in this great world.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng understood that if he wanted to safely take this Ancestral Dragon away, he had to prove himself worthy. The truth was, he hadn't lied.</p>

  <p>Zheng said, "Yes, my physical body is outside of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place. If you don't believe me, you can come with me and fetch my body."</p>

  <p>Max pondered for a moment and turned to look at the sealed Evil Dragon. After thinking for a while, he then said, "The Evil Dragon has already sealed itself, I think we will need to get someone else to remove the seal. We can go with you."</p>

  <p>The burly man coldly smiled. "It takes only a minute to verify whether you lied or not. If you are lying and wasting my time, things will not end well."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head calmly. He then looked at the Soul Sea Realm masters and said, "Please bring them together."</p>

  <p>The group of Soul Sea Realm masters of the four divine kingdoms looked like giant wooden logs, standing motionlessly on the side, listening to the conversation between Zheng and these strange warriors.</p>

  <p>They didn't understand about the Celestial Position or anything related to it. They vaguely knew that Zheng was trying to prove something to them.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't attack Zheng directly as they somewhat believed his words, which gave them a chance of survival.</p>

  <p>Even if this group of Soul Sea Realm masters hadn't taken over the corpses, they still wouldn't be able to fight against the seven masters of the Spirit Supreme Realm when they were in their best condition.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng asked them to bring them together, these martial artists of the four divine kingdoms suddenly felt a glimmer of hope rising within their hearts.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the burly man indifferently swept his eyes over these warriors and said, "They are just a group of little mice. Just kill them. It's too troublesome to bring them together!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, all of the martial artists from the four divine kingdoms present felt their hearts sink.</p>

  <p>To the Spirit Supreme Realm masters, their lives meant nothing.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Tiernan is right. It's too troublesome to bring them together. Just kill them!" After he finished speaking, Woody walked towards Turner and the other warriors from the divine kingdoms with a black saber in his hand. The group of Soul Sea Realm masters were unable to move. All Woody needed was to draw one slash of his black saber to exterminate the souls of the martial artists from the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Zheng's golden eyes suddenly flashed with a stern expression as he screamed, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>Woody would not take orders from Zheng. He raised his black saber and streams of black energy began to spread along the blade just as he was about to strike it.</p>

  <p>The martial artists of the four divine kingdoms could not believe what was going on. They never thought that they would die like this. But they couldn't resist. They couldn't accept being killed so easily.</p>

  <p>Even though they felt desperate, they had no control over the corpses they occupied. Other than showing resentment and hatred in their eyes, they were not even able to say a single word.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng said coldly, "What if I prove that I do possess the title of the golden Celestial Position in the end?"</p>

  <p>Woody lowered his black saber and turned to face Zheng, who felt confident in himself. With a smirk Woody said, "Oh? It sounds like you are really sure that you have obtained the title of the golden Celestial Position?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng said, staring at Woody, his eyes as calm as water.</p>

  <p>"What if I find out that you are lying?" Woody asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"In this great world, no one can act against you. I'll be at your disposal if I fail to make you believe me. And the other warriors too, you can do whatever you want to us then!" Zheng said.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Dorothea frowned and said, "Woody, stop. We can still kill them if what he is saying is a lie!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, the black saber in Woody's hand suddenly struck out.</p>

  <p>But instead of landing on the mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, when it was just about to hit them, Woody slightly tilted the saber to one side. A wave of thick blade energy suddenly burst out and extended several hundred feet long. The blade energy entered the ground and shot towards the distance.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh…"</p>

  <p>From the sky above the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, a thin line extending from the center of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place could be seen all the way to the edge of the land.</p>

  <p>"Alright, you decide!" Woody smiled. To him, it didn't matter whether these rats died or not.</p>

  <p>The flower in Dorothea's right eye gently turned and removed the confinement on War King Wind and the rest of the warriors. All the corpses were free from the spell.</p>

  <p>Even so, none of the Soul Sea Realm masters chose to run away.</p>

  <p>The corpses they occupied could not use the life vitality. They couldn't even fly or run fast enough. They simply had no power to resist the seven powerful masters at the Spirit Supreme Realm. If they tried to escape, they would be killed.</p>

  <p>"Let's go now. Your physical body shouldn't be too far away from the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, right?" Delroy said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"How far can it be? This great world isn't even that big." the burly man sneered.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't reply to the provocations. He turned to War King Wind and the others and said, "Everyone, let's go together!"</p>

  <p>The martial artists of the four divine kingdoms silently nodded and followed Zheng. As for the seven powerful masters of the Spirit Supreme Realm, they followed right behind everyone else.</p>

  <p>It took them about five minutes to leave the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place. After the transmission array was recovered, the group once again entered the Feather Holy Sea. They would travel along the Road of Saints in the Feather Holy Sea and return to where they set off.</p>

  <p>When they reached the Road of Saints, all the mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm took out their huge shields. They planned to use them to block the blue arrows.</p>

  <p>Delroy smiled and said, "No need to use these!" Then, he gently waved his hand. His life vitality flashed and an enchanted barrier appeared, enveloping everyone within.</p>
