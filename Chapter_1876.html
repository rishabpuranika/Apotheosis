<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know was that by setting foot on the largest platform, he was violating an unwritten rule, something very taboo.</p>

  <p>Although the six great sacred places were all equals, the one in the Skyland race was undoubtedly the most popular!</p>

  <p>It wasn't just because of the great number of warriors that cultivated their life vitality here, but most importantly, the Pristine Life Vitality cultivated by the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land that was extremely famous in this divine land.</p>

  <p>Absorbing Pristine Life Vitality here was the equivalent of being a Holy Being's personal disciple. Truly of utmost importance.</p>

  <p>In the vast divine land, not many Holy Beings had taken outsiders as their personal disciples.</p>

  <p>And for this reason, the Skyland race had slowly become an important place in the eyes of the most powerful. Such individuals had been thinking of ways to occupy a seat in the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>The status of those people on Zheng's platform were also considered high within the divine land!</p>

  <p>They had occupied the largest platform, and who would dare fight against them?</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that this platform had tons of Pristine Life Vitality, but they could do nothing but be envious. For most of them, joining this platform was impossible, they simply didn't have the qualifications.</p>

  <p>Leading by Liusu, Zheng had stepped onto this popular and important platform.</p>

  <p>Had Zheng set foot here at any other time of day, he would have been attacked at once. In groups, the warriors would have come at him ruthlessly. Any warrior whose desire to join this platform was great enough would have to pay an even greater price.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng and Liusu's arrival on this platform just happened to coincide with the start of the Tidal Surge.</p>

  <p>It meant that at the time, everyone was busy refining their Pristine Life Vitality, which was a kind of precious black crystal.</p>

  <p>Of course, this didn't mean that Zheng was totally off the hook. They could only wait to deal with him until they had completely extracted all the Pristine Life Vitality. Every bit of Pristine Life Vitality was considered incomparably important, and no one here was willing to waste it. Not even to punish Zheng.</p>

  <p>In their opinion, it wasn't an urgent or pressing matter because Zheng and Liusu could only refine ten or twenty crystals of Pristine Life Vitality.</p>

  <p>That wasn't much and they didn't really care because they'd just make them obediently hand them over later.</p>

  <p>But they were very, very wrong. And the result was far beyond any of their expectations…</p>

  <p>The Skyland race actually had their own personal reasons for setting up such divine textures on these platforms. It came down to the fact that this place was still considered sacred for cultivation. Only with competition and confrontation, everyone would speed up their refining speed.</p>

  <p>The person who poured the most life vitality normally refined the most Pristine Life Vitality. One went hand in hand with the other.</p>

  <p>At the approaching tide, all the black water would gather towards the pillar beneath the platform. The pillar was made of a special type of material, capable of filtering out the Pristine Life Vitality from the black water.</p>

  <p>Once the filtering process was completed, the Pristine Life Vitality would be refined through divine textures and distributed among the many present warriors.</p>

  <p>The stronger a warrior was, the more Pristine Life Vitality they would be able to refine. Even when on the very same platform, one warrior could refine fifty crystals of Pristine Life Vitality, while another one might only refine ten. The amount of Pristine Life Vitality depended on their own capability.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's chaotic energy was several times stronger than any life vitality!</p>

  <p>If vitality between heaven and earth was the basis for the entire divine land, then chaotic energy was the basis for the entire revolution of chaos!</p>

  <p>After Zheng had injected so much of the chaos, the result became unpalatable for the others.</p>

  <p>He had monopolized almost all of the Pristine Life Vitality by himself.</p>

  <p>The black crystals that should have been scattered beneath the feet of the many warriors were all piled beside Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>"Liusu!" shouted an enraged voice.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the platform was a lady wearing a purple robe. Her long skirt fluttered from her waist, revealing a pair of slender white legs. She was glaring at Zheng and Liusu. Her beautiful face was filled with anger.</p>

  <p>Beside the girl was a young master wearing jade-colored brocade clothes. His eyes were also emitting a cold glare.</p>

  <p>"Oh! My little sister! Why do you want to say to me?" asked Liusu.</p>

  <p>With a wave of her hand, a crisp, jingling sound rang out and dozens of black crystals gathered above her palm at once. She gently blew on them, and the black crystals instantly dissolved, changing into streams of black light that flowed into her body as she breathed.</p>

  <p>"Sister?" Zheng was slightly surprised at her reply.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The purple-robed woman's body flashed and appeared before the two of them in a split second. She looked directly at Liusu and asked, "Who is your sister?"</p>

  <p>Just as Liusu was about to speak, the young master in brocade also appeared, frowning as he sized up the pile of black crystals beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>He smiled faintly at Liusu and said, "Our big sister actually found a strong helper, but seems to me like he's just a secondary creature?</p>

  <p>Correct me if I'm wrong."</p>

  <p>"Humph! Who's your sister?" asked Liusu.</p>

  <p>But before anything could come out, the young man turned his head to look at Zheng, his tone changing at once. "You are nothing but a mere secondary creature and don't even have the right to set foot within this place. Should I kick you out myself, or are you going to scram out of my sight before I have to?"</p>

  <p>At these words, Zheng frowned and his brow creased.</p>

  <p>No matter what Liusu had in mind, Zheng had no plans of getting involved.</p>

  <p>Sure, the pile of black crystals before him really was quite precious, but for Zheng himself, it was actually rather useless. Truthfully, he had no use for life vitality anyway.</p>

  <p>Still though, the young man in brocade was too unpleasant to listen to, his words so harsh. Although Zheng was skilled at maintaining a calm heart under any provocation, this didn't mean he was going to let this man continue.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to answer the man, another figure flew up behind him and stopped right beside him, patting his shoulder. "Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Lone?" Zheng's gaze froze.</p>

  <p>It was true. The person was none other than Lone. Two months ago, Lone had finally obtained a purple trial tally and had entered the Skyland race's sacred place for cultivation.</p>

  <p>"Haha, I didn't think you'd actually come. I thought you would be the first to obtain a purple trial tally!" Lone laughed and then added, "Kurt and Lucille are here too!"</p>

  <p>Just as he was speaking, two other silhouettes appeared on the platform.</p>

  <p>Lucille and Kurt, of course.</p>

  <p>They greeted Zheng one after the other as they came over. Zheng noticed that despite being happy to see him, the three of them were faintly wary of the platform's warriors. It was apparent that these Godly Geniuses weren't willing to become enemies with them.</p>

  <p>Once this thought had crossed Zheng's mind, a smile appeared on Lone's face. "Master Qin, this is my friend's first time entering this place. He doesn't know the rules here and is innocent. Please calm your anger."</p>

  <p>The three others, on the other hand, had already been cultivating here for quite some time now and therefore, they were already familiar with the rules.</p>

  <p>Lucille, Kurt, and the others were considered the pride of the heavens, but there was no Supreme Lord to protect them here. Moreover, these people all were powerful in the divine land. Being only secondary creatures, they didn't even come close in comparison.</p>

  <p>Worst of all though, they all had powerful backgrounds.</p>

  <p>The Qin Clan's young master was a perfect example. His clan had forever occupied a specific teleporting area. Both Lone and Kurt were teleported there. They knew very well that the young master's background was anything but ordinary.</p>

  <p>At first, because the three of them were too busy refining the Pristine Life Vitality, they didn't notice Zheng.</p>

  <p>When they were almost done though, they suddenly realized that the atmosphere wasn't right. Looking outward, they noticed a large pile of black crystals sitting next to a single warrior, while the others had very few. Who was this guy? Why was he so amazing?</p>

  <p>Upon taking a closer look, the warrior's figure began to look familiar.</p>

  <p>Was that really Zheng? Uh oh! He had gotten himself into big trouble!</p>

  <p>That was why Lone had hurried over. He first apologized to Young Master Qin.</p>

  <p>Although the young master hadn't paid much attention to Zheng up until now, and in fact, he had even told him to scram earlier, he was now changing his mind. The enormous pile of black crystals had really grabbed his attention. He sneered coldly at Lone and said, "You know the rules around here?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly. Please explain, Master Qin," said Lone. Lone caught Zheng's eyes gloomy and mouth agape as if he wanted to speak. He quickly tugged at Zheng, still smiling at the young master.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene, Kurt and Lucille muttered to themselves, hearts heavy. 'Troublesome... this young man isn't going to be any good.'</p>

  <p>These platforms belonged to the Skyland race. And although they were occupied by the divine land warriors, they didn't have any written 'rules'.</p>

  <p>Those that were completely unaware and jumped onto these platforms would usually be driven away by these divine land warriors. If any trouble-maker dared to defy them, they would be beaten up and thrown into the black waters below.</p>

  <p>And now, since a rule had suddenly appeared, they knew that this fellow couldn't have any kind actions to share.</p>

  <p>"Whoever steps onto this platform will first lose both their legs. That is the rule." Young Master Qin's face suddenly revealed a trace of malice.</p>

  <p>"If the four of you want to leave, then break your own legs!"</p>

  <p>And naturally of course, the four people he was referring to were Zheng, Lucille, Kurt and Lone.</p>

  <p>He absolutely dared not to break Liusu's feet!</p>

  <p>Liusu was listening in and when she heard this, she was immediately overjoyed. She was afraid that Zheng would stop the incident and be dragged away, which wasn't a show she wanted to see.</p>
