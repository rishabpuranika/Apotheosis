  <p>As the Eight-diagram Ball continued to submerge, it began to rotate underwater. The force of its rotation created a whirlpool and the strength source in the lake shot up, then eventually landed into the lake on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was dumfounded as it happened so fast that he didn't have time to react.</p>

  <p>He realized that someone was preventing him from taking the Eight-diagram Ball beyond the door. Fortunately, he hadn't stored the strength source in his space ring, otherwise, he couldn't imagine what could have happened.</p>

  <p>There must be an almighty elder watching over this place and whoever would step in this place.</p>

  <p>Beyond Luo Zheng's knowledge, the Eight-diagram Ball didn't just return to its original location, but the mountain was also completely repaired. Even the hole that the barbarian bee queen inflicted on it had vanished like it didn't happen at all.</p>

  <p>As soon as the ball exited, the stone door slowly began to close. Once again, Teigan and Luo Luo Zheng were covered in complete darkness. Their eyes adjusted to the dark, but they still couldn't see anything.</p>

  <p>There was only one path on this other side of the door and each side was covered with silver rocks. They figured that it was the only path they could take. Without saying a word, Teigan and Luo Luo Zheng had thought of the same thing ? all the bizarre things in this place were orchestrated by a person and that person could be by their side right now.</p>

  <p>The two decided to move forward along the path in silence. But before they could even take a step, a blinding light suddenly flashed in front of them. They felt as if they had passed through a dark and narrow tunnel before finally entering an extremely wide cave.</p>

  <p>As their eyes adjusted to the light, they looked around and was surprised to see piles of silver rocks behind them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Teigan realized that they were already outside of the dark world.</p>

  <p>Someone had used some special method to send them out.</p>

  <p>Between the two of them, Luo Luo Zheng was more stunned. He had mastered the Space Law and could easily detect it, but when the light flashed earlier, he didn't sense any fluctuations of the Law Power at all.</p>

  <p>It could only mean that the token of the person who sent them out was beyond Luo Zheng's comprehension.</p>

  <p>'Maybe it's the one who built the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, '</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pondered to himself.</p>

  <p>There couldn't be anyone more interesting to Luo Luo Zheng than the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. He badly wanted to understand the master's purpose of generously giving away strength source.</p>

  <p>The strength source of this master existed in six great cultivation places, but it followed nature's law of balance. If the life forms in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were to devour the energy, they would have to return it eventually. Even the powerful warriors in the universe who couldn't cross the heavens would have to return whatever was given to them to the universe. Dust would turn back into dust. Everything gained in this universe would eventually be returned to the universe.</p>

  <p>However, when a foreign warrior entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and obtained the strength source, it was a real loss for the master. The master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was quite generous.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts, Teigan could not believe that they made it out of the dark space on the other side of the door. His face was filled with excitement. He beamed at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "This is the road at the bottom of the Sacred Spring Mountain, and it extends from the deepest part of the underground to the exit!"</p>

  <p>But just as he finished, the smile on his face faded. Teigan suddenly pointed his finger towards the road ahead, then said, "But I'm afraid the exit is too deep and narrow?"</p>

  <p>The road led directly to the exit of the Sacred Spring Mountain, but the strength source here was extremely sparse. Most of the strength source was gathered towards the higher areas of the mountain up to its peak.</p>

  <p>It was a phenomenon that was hard to explain. But to simply put it, the Sacred Spring Mountain had an inverted gravity that affected the strength source's flow. This was the reason why the strength source normally gathered towards the higher areas of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The densely packed caves in the middle of the road would lead to the peak of the mountain. However, Luo Luo Zheng and Teigan were now on the other side of the road which was at the bottom of the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>This place housed plenty of powerful beasts and their growth had something to do with the strength source.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Those are gigantic badgers," Teigan commented.</p>

  <p>Common badgers were as small as regular kittens, but these monstrous badgers were the size of a raging bull. They were huge but agile. These monstrous badgers had a killing Mu Ning as they slowly approached the two.</p>

  <p>Teigan was not yet prepared to face this kind of creature. In the Collapsing Mountain race, only grown-up men could kill monstrous badgers.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. Unlike Teigan, Luo Luo Zheng was equipped with skills to defeat these monstrous badgers. He was just worried that there was not enough space to use all his strength. With a push at his feet, he rushed towards them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Teigan were easy prey for these monstrous badgers. They split up, intending to surround their prey so they wouldn't escape.</p>

  <p>But they didn't expect that Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of escaping. Instead, he was the first to launch an attack at them.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>One of the badgers roared as a warning to the rest. Three of the badgers quickly responded and, they attacked towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These badgers had an unbelievable intelligence unlike any other creatures in the mountain. They could quickly react against an attack and knew how to work as a team to defeat their enemies.</p>

  <p>Their extraordinary strength and agility were their advantage over any creature. With these, they could easily triumph over any ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>But their luck had seemingly run out as this time, it was no ordinary warrior. They had finally met Luo Luo Zheng!</p>
