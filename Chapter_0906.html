<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression changed drastically when he saw the huge tongue coming at him!</p>

  <p>'Did this big toad know I saw it?' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>However, there was no time for Zheng to think whether the beast did or not.</p>

  <p>The others all successfully avoided the huge tongue thanks to Zheng's warning. But when Fabian and Jarrod saw this scene, their faces instantly darkened!</p>

  <p>Zheng was currently the most important figure in the Tower of Sin. Others could die, but Zheng could never be hurt and must always be protected.</p>

  <p>Although Fabian didn't want to anger the Bull-like Giant Toad any more, he didn't have any other choice at the moment but to attack it.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, retreat! Quickly!"</p>

  <p>Immediately after shouting that, Fabian and Jarrod attacked the toad almost at the same time!</p>

  <p>The two of them worked closely together, and with their combined efforts, they were able to fight against a war sage!</p>

  <p>Two beams of sword radiance shot out from Fabian's and Jarrod's hands.</p>

  <p>First, the two energies circled around each other until they merged and became one, flying towards the large tongue!</p>

  <p>Since the tongue, which was coming at Zheng at an extremely fast speed, was extremely large in size, it was impossible that their attack would miss its target.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Although the two beams of intertwined sword radiance were comparable to an attack of a war sage, the big tongue remained unscathed when it hit it. It seemed like the attack felt more like an itchy spot for the tongue than a full-on attack, and so Fabian and Jarrod felt that their efforts were just huge failure.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" Fabian screeched, frustrated by it. Seeing this scene, his and the others' hearts sank. No matter how great Zheng's destiny was, no one would be able to save him under this dire situation!</p>

  <p>This was the Dark Nether Cave. It was under the Cursed Land, so there was no way a Soul Sea Realm master would suddenly pop out and save Zheng.</p>

  <p>Besides, it wouldn't help even if a Soul Sea Realm master had come. Fabian assumed that even if Miguel came personally, he still wouldn't be a match for this toad.</p>

  <p>Facing the huge tongue which was approaching him swiftly, Zheng's mind was rapidly spinning, trying to find a way out. If the mere saliva on it could dissolve a sacred weapon, there was no way that he would be able to defend himself against it! Also, even if his special body was able to keep him from being killed by the poisonous saliva he would still surely face death if he was caught by the huge tongue and was swallowed by the Bull-like Giant Toad.</p>

  <p>The expression of Xun, who was floating beside Zheng, darkened. With a deep breath, she lifted her long spear, waved it a little, and suddenly, an invisible wave of energy shot towards the huge tongue!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Yolande who was not far away, also began to move. She pointed at the tongue with her finger and a ray of light shot towards it as well!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The attacks of the two girls worked, especially after Xun thrust out her spear, making it swirl in her hands. The invisible force that burst out from it constantly attacked the inner side of the big tongue, creating countless cuts on its side!</p>

  <p>These cuts covered an area as large as the size of a person!</p>

  <p>These cuts, however, were still very small when considering the huge size of the tongue. Because of that, none of the attacks managed to stop it from rushing towards Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Back!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng wouldn't just stand there and wait for death. The moment he saw the tongue still charging at him at full speed, he immediately retreated.</p>

  <p>However, he could see very clearly that the Bull-like Giant Toad had already crawled out of the pitch-black pool. If he were to retreat, it would definitely follow him…</p>

  <p>So how would he be able to do a counterattack?</p>

  <p>"Star shakes the earth!"</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately employed his strongest skill. It would be courting death if he still reserved his trump card at this point!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Zheng's punch created a star vortex in the air. It hit the tongue forcefully and left a huge dent on it. Unfortunately, like Xun's attack, although it did cause damage to the tongue, it didn't hurt it too much. The tongue was too large in size and it was extremely difficult - bordering impossible - to destroy it completely.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng's Stellar Body failed to kill his enemy. With that, he concluded that there were two reasons that had contributed to his failure - first, Zheng had only cultivated the Stellar Body for a very short period of time, and second, his cultivation level was still too low. This Bull-like Giant Toad wasn't something a warrior of his level could fight against.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, this was one of the reasons why this place was known as a forbidden land.</p>

  <p>Each year, more than half of the warriors who had gone into the Dark Nether Cave died, and this was only the death toll in the outer circle! The death rate for those who had successfully entered the inner circle was higher, and for those who were lucky enough to enter the core, the death rate was one hundred percent, because no one had ever returned!</p>

  <p>'What should I do?'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought to himself, backing at a lighting speed. He even jumped through space, hoping to distance himself from the huge tongue. But the speed of the tongue was obviously faster than his own!</p>

  <p>"Flame! Black flame! Cyan dragon!"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have the time to waste and he directly roared at the cyan dragon in his head.</p>

  <p>The wisp of black flame wasn't big, but it was able to burn everything.</p>

  <p>Now, he could only give it a try…</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, Zheng wouldn't use the black flame, especially when there were so many people around. However, it was the only plan of action he could think of at that time. He didn't want his body to be melted by this giant tongue and to become the giant toad's food!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a tiny wisp of flame shot out from the spot between Zheng's eyebrows!</p>

  <p>The moment the flame appeared, it seemed to dance around in the air merrily.</p>

  <p>When Yolande saw the wisp of black flame, her eyes widened. Her jaw dropped, and she looked like as if she was lost in thought!</p>

  <p>When Xun saw the black flame, her face fell. As if it was on instinct, she turned to Yolande...</p>

  <p>Although Xun was attached to Zheng's body, she had her own thoughts.</p>

  <p>She had seen this black flame before, but Yolande, on the other hand, had never seen it before.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Xun didn't want Yolande to notice the black flame.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was in a dire situation right now, and Xun didn't have time to think more about this.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw a black flame emerge from the spot between Zheng's brows. As if it had a soul of its own, the black flame directly charged towards the tongue despite Zheng not giving it any kind of direction.</p>

  <p>Compared to the huge tongue, the black flame was insignificant. It looked like an ant against it. However, it instantly burrowed its way into the tongue. Since this wisp of flame was too small, the instant it disappeared into the tongue, it left no trace on the surface.</p>

  <p>The moment the black flame injected itself into the huge tongue, it started twisting violently, as if it was in great pain, temporarily halting its mission to catch Zheng.</p>

  <p>Like a snake that had its head chopped off, the tongue wiggled crazily for no apparent reason. Luckily, the people around it had already distanced themselves from the tongue. Otherwise, if they were accidentally caught by the tongue, they would end up dead!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The tongue repeatedly whipped the ground, creating a huge crater and sending dust and big pieces of rock into the air.</p>

  <p>With the loud noise, the tongue had alerted all the demonic beasts within several dozen miles. These demonic beasts, however, were nowhere near the strength and power of the giant toad, so every single one of them had deeply hidden themselves. In the outer circle of the Dark Nether Cave, this giant toad was one of the most dangerous creatures and was on the top of the food chain!</p>

  <p>"What exactly is that black flame? How is it making this Bull-like Giant Toad suffer so much?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know! Who knows how many secrets this guy has!"</p>

  <p>"This toad is too stupid. Why didn't it just hold its tongue back?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that the Bull-like Giant Toad is dumber than you? The black flame is obviously still inside its tongue. Although I'm not sure what that black flame is, it seemed like it has inflicted the Bull-like Giant Toad extreme pain. However, if that black flame doesn't come out of that tongue and the Bull-like Giant Toad retracts it back to its mouth, wouldn't it mean that the black flame would burn in its mouth?"</p>

  <p>The huge tongue was still twisting and pounding the ground, until suddenly, everyone saw its front part burst into flames. The tongue was on fire! And somehow, a ten-feet stretch starting from its tip had already completely burnt!</p>

  <p>The air reeked of its singed flesh, like that of roasted meat!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Only then did the wisp of black flame come out of the toad's tongue!</p>

  <p>And the moment the black flame came out, the tongue rolled back, still wriggling as if it was fleeing in panic to avoid the black flame from burning again. As soon as the long tongue curled back, it instantly disappeared into the darkness not too far away.</p>

  <p>At this time, the black flame seemed to be very happy about its feat as it circled in the air and chirped merrily for a while before it returned back to the spot between Zheng's eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Without any pause for rest, Zheng looked at the toad that had already left the pond and shouted, "Let's hurry up and get away from here!"</p>

  <p>The mountain-like toad lay prostrate in the darkness. Despite them being miles away from it, it would just take it a single leap to get to where they were. And if that happened, not one of them would be able to escape!</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the direction Zheng was gazing at, but they did not see anything. However, they did not ask Zheng about what he had seen. It was simple for them to imagine. If the mere tongue of the Bull-like Giant Toad was so horrible, they didn't need to see what would come next. And despite not being able to battle it fully, they knew that they would be no match for it. Since Zheng had already burned a piece of the toad's tongue, it was more than wise for them to take the chance and run away!</p>

  <p>They would leave the giant toad be, and they had no plans - or nerve, for that matter - on taking it on again!</p>
