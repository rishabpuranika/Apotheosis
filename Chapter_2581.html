<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>David might be incredibly annoying, but he was superior to the others in his level in terms of both talent and blood.</p>

  <p>It was why the Yellow Emperor race treated him as a national treasure.</p>

  <p>He never received any kind of punishment, even after offending the elders of his race. The exiles of his race did have a bias towards him, though.</p>

  <p>On behalf of the Yellow Emperor race, the woman in blue, the burly man, and others were there to fight. They were not weak, but there was still a large gap between them and David.</p>

  <p>Despite wanting to say something to David for his arrogance, they didn't.</p>

  <p>No matter how furious they were, they knew better than to speak against him.</p>

  <p>"Look! They are approaching!" someone called while pointing to the sky.</p>

  <p>They watched a group of people fly from afar.</p>

  <p>From the front of the group, Adele alighted on the ground with a toe first and then took several steps forward. Her brilliant eyes glared at the people of the Yellow Emperor race. "We, the Nine Li race, have come for battle," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man adorned in a golden robe walked out to greet her.</p>

  <p>His eyes were focused on Adele's face, and he couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>"Long time no see, Grand Elder Adele. It seems you have become even more beautiful!"</p>

  <p>He was Lancelot, Grand Elder of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Adele scowled at his words. "Enough! Let us get down to business."</p>

  <p>Ignoring her attitude, Lancelot smiled. "Of course. We have been fighting for so long that all of us wish to see it end. Once we confirm the ownership of the Sky South Bone Tower, we will fight no longer. I believe it is best if we all get along, right? My people do not cultivate very hard, so please show a little bit of mercy."</p>

  <p>The Nine Li people rolled their eyes at his words.</p>

  <p>It was the Yellow Emperor race that proposed to have a battle over the Sky South Bone Tower. The moment the Nine Li race had accepted their challenge, they had killed the outstanding disciples of the Nine Li race in the Immemorial Wilderness. Even before the two sides had fought, the Nine Li race suffered a great loss by their hand. It was obvious that the Yellow Emperor race had been well prepared for the battle. It was very hypocritical for them to speak in such a manner now.</p>

  <p>The rules of this battle were simple. Both sides would send five mid-rank Wild Gods, and if all five of one side were defeated then they would lose.</p>

  <p>Each side took a moment to prepare, and then they distanced themselves.</p>

  <p>During the battle, the Wild Gods would turn into over-ten-thousand-foot tall giants, so they needed an immense amount of space.</p>

  <p>In the wilderness a long way away, many people had gathered to watch the fight.</p>

  <p>Once the ownership of the Sky South Bone Tower was determined, the Immemorial Wildernesses and cities around it would also belong to the winner.</p>

  <p>The forces within the Flying Sickle City were concerned with what the result would be. It would, after all, affect their future survival.</p>

  <p>There was a series of cracks that echoed in the silence.</p>

  <p>David finished cracking his knuckles and then said, "Grand Elder, allow me to fight directly. I can handle all the five good-for-nothings of the Nine Li race!"</p>

  <p>Lancelot glanced at him with a bland expression.</p>

  <p>To have to be in the presence of such a conceited person was so tiresome. Lancelot, like the people of his race, did not like David.</p>

  <p>However, David's talents were an asset. After having prepared for so many years, the Yellow Emperor race finally had the confidence to challenge the Nine Li race because they had David. With David to fight on behalf of their race, the Nine Li race wouldn't win. There would be no one they had to beat David.</p>

  <p>"You will be the last to go," Lancelot instructed David. "Roy, you are the first."</p>

  <p>David scowled at Lancelot. "What is the meaning of this? If you were not intending to have me fight in the beginning, I would have chosen to remain in the city and sleep!"</p>

  <p>"If that is what you wish, be my guest. Leave." Lancelot made sure to keep a look of indifference on his face.</p>

  <p>Lancelot knew David well though. David always wanted to best the others, and prove he was stronger and better. He would not leave, no matter how irritated he was now.</p>

  <p>A hint of helplessness passed over David's face before disappearing.</p>

  <p>If it were anyone else, they would have no choice but to be obedient and follow Lancelot's command. However, David was no ordinary person. In a fit of anger, he growled, "Fine. I will just sleep. I'm too lazy to go back though. I'll just sleep here."</p>

  <p>He then turned over and lay on the ground, closing his eyes and dozing off.</p>

  <p>"What is that man from the Yellow Emperor race doing?" asked someone from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"What's he doing by lying on the ground? Will he not be fighting?"</p>

  <p>"What a strange man," someone else whispered.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li people were utterly confused, and wondered what he could possibly be doing.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods in the distance whispered to one another, and some of them laughed.</p>

  <p>The members of the Yellow Emperor race felt humiliated, and Lancelot's expression darkened with anger. However, he could do nothing about it, so he simply turned a blind eye.</p>

  <p>Adele recognized that David was the man who delivered the letter of challenge the last time. She felt it was not so strange for a man like that to act in such a way.</p>

  <p>"The first round will be Yeoman," Adele said softly.</p>

  <p>"Of course Grand Elder!"</p>

  <p>Yeoman saluted and then flew out.</p>

  <p>He held an emerald green bamboo stick, and as he moved forward, the Wild God Power in his body activated.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he grew 12, 000 feet and stood in front of the Nine Li people. The bamboo stick in his hand also elongated and became over ten thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>"This green stick is made of the same material as Romeo's bamboo sword. Its size is also changeable." Zheng's eyes flashed. "I almost forget that I don't have a weapon."</p>

  <p>He should be able to turn into a giant now as well.</p>

  <p>It was true that his Shadow Bearing Sword was powerful, but he had brought it down from the divine land.</p>

  <p>Despite that he had merged with the soul of the Shadow Bearing Sword, he was still unable to unleash its full power, let alone change its size.</p>

  <p>If he turned into a giant, he wouldn't be able to use the sword.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Bearing Sword was only several feet long. It would be even smaller than a toothpick in a giant's hand. He couldn't stick his opponent with a toothpick now, could he?</p>

  <p>Realizing his predicament, Zheng called to Adele in a low voice, "Grand Elder?"</p>

  <p>Adele turned to him. "Zheng, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I need a weapon," Zheng said, pointing at the bamboo stick in Yeoman's hand. "A weapon with a changeable size."</p>

  <p>Adele ran a hand through her hair, and smiled in apology. "I apologize. I can't believe I forgot such an important thing."</p>

  <p>When the people of the Nine Li race reached a higher level, they were awarded a weapon.</p>

  <p>So many things had changed and happened after Zheng had made the breakthrough that everyone had forgotten.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Giacomo who stood beside them said, "Zheng, you have excellent swordsmanship, yes?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>A cyan light flashed and a long sword appeared in Giacomo's hand.</p>

  <p>The sword was fashioned of bamboo, and emitted a dark green glow. It was of much better quality than Romeo's bamboo sword.</p>

  <p>"This is my sword, made from wild bones and bamboo. It's called a wild weapon, and can change its size according to the change of its owner.</p>

  <p>Catch!"</p>

  <p>Giacomo suddenly tossed the delicate bamboo sword to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Thank you! I appreciate it."</p>

  <p>Zheng held the sword close to his face, and looked at it with a critical eye.</p>

  <p>How Giacomo had used wild bones to refine such a miraculous weapon was beyond Zheng's imagination. There were extremely talented warriors in this barren world.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, there was a violent explosion. It seemed the battle between Yeoman and Roy was over, and the winner was decided.</p>
