  <p>
</p>

  <p>Behind Fredric, arrows covered the sky and earth, coming straight for all.</p>

  <p>A sort of blue light shown on each of the arrows— under the night sky, the scene was beautiful, like thousands of stars shooting across the sky.</p>

  <p>But everyone was well aware that this beauty stemmed from the most lethal poison.</p>

  <p>"What? How do we get past this?"</p>

  <p>Renzo's voice trembled.</p>

  <p>Before this moment, they had only seen hundreds of sharp arrows lined up on one side— it wasn't too difficult to get through the wall of arrows.</p>

  <p>But now, there seemed to be hundreds of thousands of arrows before them. If the previous wall of arrows was an ordinary wall, this one in front of them was like the wall of a grand city.</p>

  <p>Randy's eyes flashed in urgency as he called out, "Let's go around the arrows!"</p>

  <p>"It's no use." Fredric shook his head before pointing to a beautiful lady beside him. "We've tried it. We've explored the width of this arrow wall and it seems to cover the entire Slow Arrow Area!"</p>

  <p>As they carefully discussed countermeasures, they began retreating as far as they could.</p>

  <p>As everyone moved back, more and more warriors began to gather, including the crown prince of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, Bram, Gregory, and the others. All of them joined in the retreat.</p>

  <p>"How strange! I've never seen so many arrows anytime I passed through the Slow Arrow Area before."</p>

  <p>"Is there something bad happening this year?"</p>

  <p>"For now, let's focus on avoiding this wave of arrows. We can move on after this disappears!"</p>

  <p>With more and more warriors gathered, the entire crowd began calling out.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Camilla suggested, "Let's head into the sea and disembark from the other side. Would that be a good idea?"</p>

  <p>The minute she finished speaking, everyone looked at her as if she were an idiot, leaving her rather embarrassed as her face flushed red. Randy then broke the silence. "I forgot to tell you all. This is the only path to the Feather Emperor Secret Land. There is no other path for us to take," he explained.</p>

  <p>As a result, dozens of teams and hundreds of divine-level talents were forced to retreat completely. After everyone left the Slow Arrow Area, the arrows began to dissipate one after another.</p>

  <p>"Again!" Gritting his teeth, Fredric continued to lead his team forward with gusto.</p>

  <p>Warriors who entered the Feather Holy Sea were supposed to be the most powerful, heroic, young elites of the divine kingdoms. How could they have been defeated by such a minor setback?</p>

  <p>Once again, everyone followed Fredric and stepped into the Slow Arrow Area.</p>

  <p>With a frown, Randy said, "Something doesn't feel right. There seems to be some unforeseen event occurring within the Feather Emperor Secret Land!"</p>

  <p>"Regardless of what happened, we'll have to enter it eventually," Luo Zheng said in a matter-of-fact way.</p>

  <p>While others could retreat, Luo Zheng could not. Although he could check on Yudie's condition through his memory after he fused with the world's will, he couldn't rest easy until he obtained the life stones.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Randy agreed with a laugh. The man was also someone who refused to give up easily.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng and the others stepped back into the Slow Arrow Area.</p>

  <p>Though many were cautious, a careless soul fell desperate. As the hundreds of sharp arrows pierced through him, he couldn't avoid the Dragon Arsenic. His body vanished in a moment.</p>

  <p>Inwardly, everyone sighed at the thought of the warrior who died from poison. But it didn't stop them from advancing.</p>

  <p>Once they had all moved forward to a certain extent, a dense, black mass of sharp arrows appeared in front of them once again.</p>

  <p>"Not again..."</p>

  <p>Even Fredric felt frustrated.</p>

  <p>Many of the royalties of the divine kingdoms looked conflicted— they might not be able to pass through, that day.</p>

  <p>It was humiliating— they had explored the Feather Holy Sea once a year until then, but so many of them were unable to pass through the Slow Arrow Area. It was likely that the others outside the sea wouldn't believe them if they lived to tell the story.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was stuck in hesitation, someone exclaimed, "Everyone, follow behind me! I can get through the area."</p>

  <p>Hearing this voice, everyone looked over at the source— it was the crown prince of the Wind Divine Kingdom, Callan Huo.</p>

  <p>Behind him was Fiona, as well as the other warriors from the Wind Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Although Callan Huo was the crown prince of the Wind Divine Kingdom, his reputation was not as well-known as the other three crown princes. Generally, those who held this title were considered the most outstanding warriors among the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Callan's talent, however, was incomparable to Fiona's. Rumor had it that Fiona might end up as the first empress in the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>But this didn't mean that Callan wasn't outstanding in his own manner.</p>

  <p>Fiona's brilliance was just great enough to outshine the crown prince of the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Callan! What can you do?" With a cold laugh, Fredric asked. From the beginning, he looked down on Callan like a piece of garbage.</p>

  <p>But Callan's expression remained calm as he said, "I'll just use something to block the arrows."</p>

  <p>"Haha! Callan, what are you going on about? Don't you know that these sharp arrows are made from Meteoric Iron? What can block these arrows?"</p>

  <p>The very idea made Fredric sneer.</p>

  <p>As royalties of the divine kingdoms, they all, more or less, had some form of secret weapon in their hands. Just as Fiona had a semi-divine weapon, some crown princes had some sort of defensive semi-divine weapons.</p>

  <p>However, there wasn't much they could do against the rain of arrows.</p>

  <p>In reality, it wasn't as though no one had ever thought of this method before. In order to easily pass through the Slow Arrow Area, someone had brought in a piece of ten-foot-tall heptyl gold, which was usually considered to be a refining treasure. The metal was also ten feet wide— even a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior would need a great deal of effort to break it through.</p>

  <p>Even the heptyl gold couldn't block the arrows. The moment they shot at the metal, the Time Law suddenly shifted, making the speed increase by a thousand times. In an instant, countless holes were pierced through the gold, and the warrior had died from the Dragon Arsenic.</p>

  <p>When no one believed him, Callan's face turned stubborn— he knew that people looked down on him and that was what he hated most. This pushed him to exclaim, "I can do it!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Fiona spoke up for him as well. "Trust in my brother!</p>

  <p>He has something that can block the arrows!"</p>

  <p>Unlike the royalties of the other divine kingdoms, the ones of the Wind Divine Kingdom didn't have many overt struggles or battles. In turn, Fiona and Callan had a relatively good relationship with each other as siblings.</p>

  <p>"Then take it out and let us have a look!" a prince said. Although he said it gently, his tone was rather taunting. It was clear that they didn't buy Callan's words.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Callan lightly tapped on a ring hanging from his chest.</p>

  <p>Following a flash of light, a huge boulder suddenly appeared before him.</p>

  <p>A dark green luster covered the surface of the stone, but it was mixed.</p>

  <p>Warriors could only sense the power of the Earth Law Power in ordinary stones, but certain special stones contained other Law Power, such as Thunder Energy Stone, containing the Thunder Law Power. Several different kinds of Law Power could be felt from the stone Callan just summoned.</p>

  <p>To be exact, there were five kinds of Law Power in the stone— the power of Metal Law, Wood Law, Water Law, Fire Law, and Earth Law.</p>

  <p>This kind of stone was not new to Luo Zheng. Before the Martial Arts Contest even began, when Luo Zheng had taken the pre-qualifying test, the World Commercial Alliance had used the exact same kind of stone— the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>It was said that this stone had been excavated from the Magnetic Sacred Mountain at the bottom of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. Although there was only a small piece of it in the World Commercial Alliance, Callan had taken out such a large piece of it.</p>

  <p>Seeing the magnetic stone, everyone was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>Its origin was recognized by all— the problem was that the magnetic stone itself was extremely difficult to extract. Even a Soul Sea Realm master would have to expend a great deal of energy to extract one from the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>In the end, it was useless. Although it had gathered within it the power of the five elements, this power was extremely complex. Warriors couldn't comprehend any Law Power from the stone. The stone itself couldn't be used to refine pills or weapons.</p>
