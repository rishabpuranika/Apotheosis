<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Blood Prison Enchantment was, in fact, an exceptionally formidable enchantment.</p>

  <p>Even a demon king like Aldrich spent a long time and a lot of hard effort just trying to break through it.</p>

  <p>Such enchantments with great power were usually used against adversaries who were in the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>If it were someone else who found that his normal enchantment had failed to trap Luo Zheng, he would end his efforts and give up immediately.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande had a unique and controlled personality. When Luo Zheng lightly broke her enchanted barriers, the girl's levelheadedness never faltered. Instead, she did not hesitate to cast the Blood Prison Enchantment.</p>

  <p>Her colorful dress swayed as she leaned on the edge of the Blood Prison Enchantment, wearing a pair of small clogs. "Can you break through the Blood Prison Enchantment, too?" she challenged Luo Zheng who was in the enchantment, a faint smile slightly visible on her face.</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the enchantment, Luo Zheng felt it emanating a bloody Mu Ning. With his eyes fixated on her face, he suddenly cracked into a grin and said, "I thought you couldn't smile. Surprisingly, you have such an attractive smile."</p>

  <p>His tough opponent blinked, revealing a hint of confusion in her grey pupils. Then, with a flip of her delicate hand, jets of bloody auras within the enchantment shot towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>From what he could remember, the bloody Mu Ning had the power to disturb the mind and drive people mad.</p>

  <p>Under its influence, people with weak souls might even destroy each other.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng felt hot while the bloody Mu Ning seeped into his mind, he could sense it striving to affect his soul. It made him a little excited.</p>

  <p>Unable to deflect its invasion, he closed his eyes and felt himself entering the state of forgetting himself. When he opened his eyes again, however, there was only sobriety and calmness in his facial expression.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, it turned out that the Blood Prison Enchantment had little impact on him.</p>

  <p>"I can crash the Blood Prison Enchantment as well!"</p>

  <p>After the words left his mouth, he walked to the edge of the Blood Prison Enchantment and then swung a punch at it.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Emerald Crystal's power shot out of his left arm and into the enchantment.</p>

  <p>Although the Emerald Crystal could restrain the Blood Prison Enchantment, the enchantment itself was exceptional. And as a result, when the Emerald Crystal's power condensed and formed a web, the enchantment's bloody Mu Ning began to devour the power.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could enlarge the opening in the Blood Prison Enchantment, the bloody Mu Ning succeeded in swallowing and neutralizing the Emerald Crystal's power.</p>

  <p>The triumphant girl's face broke into a thin smile again. "You said you could break the Blood Prison Enchantment. Then why don't you do it?" she taunted.</p>

  <p>On hearing Yolande's provocation, Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and contemplated, 'This Blood Prison Enchantment is much stronger than the transparent enchanted barriers. On top of that, it could also naturally fix itself. With my current strength, breaking through it is proving more difficult than I thought.</p>

  <p>In theory, my demonic life energy could devour all kinds of life vitality.</p>

  <p>However, even though the enchantment possesses so much life vitality, it was futile trying to eradicate it that way last time.' He paused and frowned a little. 'As it can't be destroyed from the outside of the enchantment, what if I pour the demonic life energy inside the enchantment instead?'</p>

  <p>A victorious glint flashed in his eyes. The idea did not sound far-fetched.</p>

  <p>While creating a small gap in the enchantment using Emerald Crystal, he could transfer the demonic life energy to its insides as well!</p>

  <p>The man had no idea if his method would work, but with the situation at the moment, it was worth a try!</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Luo Zheng started to relax and even had a long and exaggerated stretch.</p>

  <p>"Why should I break the enchantment? Having me locked up like this is good. You can keep me here if you want," he said and laughed.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished speaking, Yolande was at a loss for words. Although the girl was outstandingly intelligent, she was extremely simple. Now she had no idea that the man was deliberately trying to provoke her.</p>

  <p>As she watched Luo Zheng stretch leisurely in the Blood Prison Enchantment, Yolande's competitive spirit finally burst. She did not realize that there were more expressions on her face today than in the last few years combined!</p>

  <p>"You're hopeless if you give up. You have to keep trying anyway," persuaded Yolande, leaning on the edge of the enchantment.</p>

  <p>"No, I do not want to try. You are in the Illuminating Soul Realm, and I am only half-step into the nature level. How can I break your enchantment?" Shaking his head solemnly, he thought, 'Yolande is too simple for her own good. It's so much fun to tease her.'</p>

  <p>"How would you know that you really can't do this when you haven't even tried?" Yolande persisted, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that! I just know," he said, waving his hand helplessly.</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes flickered with disappointment.</p>

  <p>For a moment, she just stood there as though she were thinking about something. Suddenly, she added, "Just have a try with all your might. If you ever do get to break this enchantment, I might consider giving you a reward."</p>

  <p>"Really?" A surprised expression spread across Zheng's face. Somewhat suspicious, he examined her pretty face and asked, "What's the reward?"</p>

  <p>"Any reward you want as long as I can do it!" Yolande spoke earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Well…"</p>

  <p>The man raised his eyebrows slightly. It was just what he wanted her to say.</p>

  <p>Although, Luo Zheng never thought that the girl could come up with such a solution so soon. For a brief minute, he wondered if he should not have tricked her into such a situation.</p>
