  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's entire body glowed golden from all the Sanskrit words written on his skin.</p>

  <p>Marsh stood and waited patiently.</p>

  <p>After five minutes, Luo Zheng's body slowly dimmed.</p>

  <p>His outline became more distinct and the aura he exuded was more refined.</p>

  <p>The scene intrigued Marsh. "Absorbing the preternatural fire can make you become stronger?"</p>

  <p>From a Holy Being's perception, it was apparent at first glance that Luo Zheng's body was far mightier than an ordinary True God's.</p>

  <p>For example, Luo Zheng's astonishing slash that he performed in the debate venue well proved his powerful strength.</p>

  <p>If an ordinary low-rank True God made that move, their entire body would've collapsed before they even completed the strike.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's body had no problems standing up against such a force.</p>

  <p>The young man had shown so many incredible things that his incredibly tough physical body was often overshadowed and ignored.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied to Marsh with a nod.</p>

  <p>Marsh sighed, "I have never heard of such a magical method..."</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng could adapt himself to the Sun Essence Flame in the outermost layer then he naturally would seize the opportunity to refine his body.</p>

  <p>He still had no idea as to what extent his body could be cultivated with the Grand Weapon Refining Method.</p>

  <p>Ever since entering the divine land, he found it really difficult to find suitable flames for his cultivation.</p>

  <p>The answer, fortunately, came to him from his mother who told him that all cultivation methods related to Sanskrit were heritages left behind by the Chaos Ancient God. Thus, the Grand Weapon Refining Method's limit could very well go beyond the divine land.</p>

  <p>Its limit could be further explored in the future.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng had to solve his problem.</p>

  <p>"I'll teleport you once again but you'll have to rely on yourself afterward," Marsh told him.</p>

  <p>He then carried Luo Zheng and zoomed off once again.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them traveled several million feet!</p>

  <p>They were high above and couldn't find any trace of the Sunrest Tree or the Non-combat Zone below.</p>

  <p>All Luo Zheng could see was a white, oval shape on the ground. The white was no doubt snow that had covered the place for the past few months.</p>

  <p>He noticed, however, that the circular sun had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The distance between him and the sun had gotten too close so he could no longer see it fully. All he saw was a sea of fire!</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>It was suspended above Luo Zheng's head vertically. The flames blazed and darted in all directions, painting a spectacular scene above him.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Rays of Sun Essence Flame formed fiery red clouds that spiraled in the wind.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of caution on Marsh's face as he faced the Sun Essence Flame.</p>

  <p>He raised a hand and pointed it to the air.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an invisible sword intent shot out from his finger.</p>

  <p>"Sea Subdue!"</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>With his command, the aura of the area around them suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard the sound of surging waves amidst the flames.</p>

  <p>There was a sense of desolation that stirred within him, feeling as if the sea had risen to meet him.</p>

  <p>'This is the sword intent that Marsh has comprehended...</p>

  <p>It isn't a token nor a Divine Dao. He just managed to cultivate the sword intent to such a terrifying level! So powerful...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p>

  <p>The sword intent served as a barrier against the fiery red clouds so they could no longer do any harm to Marsh or Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, they seemed to be drifting away from them in the waves of tide.</p>

  <p>"I can only take you until here. I won't be able to withstand it if I continue going up," Marsh told him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and took out a flying sword from his space ring.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't fly, he would have to rely on his flying sword for the rest of the way.</p>

  <p>As he stepped onto the sword, Luo Zheng also took out the Sun-resisting Umbrella he had obtained from the debate venue.</p>

  <p>The reason why Harper became the captain of the ship was because of this very umbrella.</p>

  <p>It was only by using such an item that one could get close to the huge fireball that was the sun.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he opened it, a bright yellow light curtain immediately enveloped him and the flying sword.</p>

  <p>He knew he had to be careful now. It was going to be really bad if the flying sword, his only means of transportation, got melted off by the Sun Essence Flame.</p>

  <p>"I'll be going now," he said.</p>

  <p>Marsh nodded. "We're all counting on you."</p>

  <p>With the Sun-resisting Umbrella on hand and the flying sword at his feet, Luo Zheng turned into a streak of light and rapidly flew away.</p>

  <p>A lot of thoughts ran through Marsh's mind as he watched Luo Zheng's retreating figure.</p>

  <p>Never had he thought that the fate of the entire divine land would rest on the shoulders of the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Nor did he expect that the destroyed Luo Clan actually hid such powerful abilities.</p>

  <p>He was still undecided on whether he should stand on the Luo Clan's side or not but the inborn sense of responsibility the Sword Clan had instilled in him obligated him to save the many lives that resided in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly flew past the fiery red clouds.</p>

  <p>The light curtain of the Sun-resisting Umbrella protected him effectively.</p>

  <p>He did not feel hot at all, in fact, it was rather cool.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a magic weapon.</p>

  <p>However, despite the fact that the Sun-resisting Umbrella proved itself to be very effective, he still did not dare take the Sun Essence Flame lightly.</p>

  <p>The fiery red clouds could not harm him but they moved quickly and formed strong whirlpools.</p>

  <p>If he wasn't careful, he could easily fall into these whirlpools and get sent careening towards god knew where.</p>

  <p>After flying cautiously for more than an hour, Luo Zheng noticed more and more fire clouds surrounding him.</p>

  <p>He was now close to the middle layer of the sun.</p>

  <p>Not even Holy Beings would be able to bear the heat at this stage.</p>

  <p>'The Sun Essence Flame here is probably a hundred times stronger than in the outer layer. If I lose the Sun-resisting Umbrella's protection here, I'd burn to ashes instantly!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He was also quite shocked by the fire clouds formed by the layers of the Sun Essence Flame.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea how the sun was formed and how it maintained such a powerful momentum despite burning in the sky for several divine eras.</p>

  <p>It was at that point that he truly felt insignificant.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>A sharp, whooshing sound suddenly came from behind him.</p>

  <p>When he turned, tens of thousands of Sun Essence Flame rays coalesced and now formed into a huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>"Damn!"</p>

  <p>His expression changed and he immediately tried to fly to the other side.</p>

  <p>However, the whirlpool was too large. Had Luo Zheng been a consummate True God or a Holy Being then he might've stood a chance.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he was only a low-rank True God and he was merely relying on a flying sword to fly. It was impossible for him to escape.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng felt that there was a great force pulling him, as if he was a mere leaf that was sucked in by the whirlpool. He lost control of his body and whirled around crazily.</p>
