<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Other Shore had always been a magical place.</p>

  <p>It was home to the Other Shore Tokens that did not just have Other Shore Power, but had various special abilities as well.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type always possessed strong Other Shore Power. For example, the Strength God Totem had more Other Shore Power than others in Stage Thirteen, however it was no longer popular among the warriors.</p>

  <p>For one, the bodies of the warriors in the Lust World were restricted, so they couldn't exert the full strength of it. Besides, only strength was not enough.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's body was able to handle the Strength God Totem, and so he chose it without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Among the Other Shore Tokens, the mysterious and descending types were the most popular.</p>

  <p>They were known to have rare abilities.</p>

  <p>"The Heart of Accomplice is a mysterious Other Shore Token. It was once possessed by a member of the Celestial Wolf race," the Ear Mouse explained.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Wolf race were extremely powerful. However, they were small in numbers. This had prohibited them from going against super forces.</p>

  <p>In the early days, the Celestial Wolf race dwelled mostly in the Star Wolf Province. They rarely participated in the disputes outside.</p>

  <p>However, that changed when the Dog Barbarian race, a super force, invaded the Star Wolf Province some ten thousand years ago.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Wolf race fought with all their might, but they were weak and powerless against the Dog Barbarian race.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Dog Barbarian race, Lord Shaw, was one of the top warriors in the entire Source World. No one in the Celestial Wolf race was at par with him. Lord Shaw easily annihilated the Celestial Wolf race, including their leader. The Celestial Wolf race neared extinction.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, Lord Shaw was killed by someone from the Celestial Wolf race at the last minute. The Dog Barbarian race had to flee the Star Wolf Province. Surprisingly, that killer was only at the primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>"The primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm?" Luo Zheng blinked his eyes in confusion. "How strong was Lord Shaw?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse rubbed its chin as it thought. "He was almost as strong as Eastern Emperor Taiyi of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. They weren't on the same level, but Lord Shaw wasn't too inferior."</p>

  <p>"What?!" Luo Zheng gasped.</p>

  <p>Soon, he'd be able to enter the Chaotic Source Realm and he knew it would make him stronger.</p>

  <p>However, it never occurred to him that a warrior of Chaotic Source Realm would be able to battle powerful warriors like Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. From what I know, Lord Shaw was lured into a trap and the Celestial Wolf race attacked him together," Dorothy retorted.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse shook its head firmly. "That's what the rumors say, but we can confirm otherwise."</p>

  <p>Conflicts between alien races were of no concern to the human race. It wasn't a surprise that Dorothy did not have the exact information from the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"How can a warrior at the primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm kill Lord Shaw? That's incredible!" Luo Zheng was still skeptical of the Ear Mouse's story.</p>

  <p>"As far as we know, the attacker relied on the Heart of Accomplice," the Ear Mouse said as it stared at the three hearts above the passageway.</p>

  <p>"How much Other Shore Power the Heart of Accomplice contains? Lord Shaw was powerful. Not even two to three thousand Jun of force could hurt him," Dorothy remarked.</p>

  <p>"He killed Lord Shaw by relying on the ability of the Heart of Accomplice, not the Other Shore Power," the Ear Mouse explained. "The heart can turn someone into an accomplice."</p>

  <p>Lord Shaw was feeling invincible. After they had killed the leader of the Celestial Wolf race, the Dog Barbarian race was thirsty and ready to kill more.</p>

  <p>But, the moment Lord Shaw walked into the tribe of the Celestial Wolf race, he heard a heartbeat.</p>

  <p>Everyone else heard it too, including the rats lurking in the Star Wolf Province.</p>

  <p>The crowd stirred in confusion and then, amidst the chaos, someone from the Celestial Wolf race stepped out and rushed towards Lord Shaw.</p>

  <p>Lord Shaw merely snickered as this warrior approached. After all, he was only at the primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Lord Shaw snatched that man and tore him to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the man was killed, an Other Shore Token rose from his body. It was the Heart of Accomplice.</p>

  <p>It hovered in the air and floated above Lord Shaw's head.</p>

  <p>Unfamiliar with the object above him, Lord Shaw simply punched it away.</p>

  <p>The Heart of Accomplice reeled a few million miles away. As it flew into the distance, the sound of the heartbeat grew louder. Everyone was bothered by it.</p>

  <p>Then, after a few minutes, the heart returned and took its place once more above Lord Shaw's head.</p>

  <p>Once more, he attempted to punch the heart, but it remained still. He tried and tried but kept on failing. It started beating faster and faster.</p>

  <p>Soon, its beating became indecipherably fast and then, all of a sudden, it stopped. When it did, Lord Shaw's body floated into the air, limped, and crashed into the ground. He was dead.</p>

  <p>Both his soul and body disappeared silently.</p>

  <p>Supposedly, Lord Shaw's body and soul were extremely strong. His death came as a surprise to everyone.</p>

  <p>"Lord Shaw killed himself. That man of the Celestial Wolf race chose him as an accomplice. After that man died, his accomplice must die as well," the Ear Mouse said.</p>

  <p>"It sounds like the life contract of the Life Godly Way," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The life contract also required contracted lives to be connected. If one died, the other would as well.</p>

  <p>"No, not really. The life of contract can't compare to the Heart of Accomplice!" The Ear Mouse sneered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way's energy level was much lower. It made the life contract vulnerable. It was already difficult to work against ordinary warriors, let alone a warrior as strong as Lord Shaw.</p>

  <p>The Heart of Accomplice could actually cause the death of a top master in the Source World. That made it absolutely terrifying.</p>

  <p>"We investigated it for a long time. We even looked into the past of the attacker, but we could not find the origin of the Heart of Accomplice. It became regarded as a unique Other Shore Token in the Source World. But perhaps that isn't true anymore," the Ear Mouse elaborated.</p>

  <p>There were now three Hearts of Accomplice. It was no longer considered unique.</p>

  <p>"If what you said is true, then that makes the Other Shore Token truly terrifying," Dorothy said with a cautious look on her face.</p>

  <p>With the Heart of Accomplice, an ordinary warrior could sacrifice their own life to kill a top warrior in the Source World. It was a very worthy deal.</p>
