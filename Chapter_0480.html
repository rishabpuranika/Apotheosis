  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lily hailed from the Demon Night. She had slender legs and malicious aura. After Zheng's visit to the Killing Sword Mountain, she became his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Zheng commanded Lily to take the sword and attack while he evaded attacks from the two palms! There was no time for Zheng to think about other things, as the slightest distraction would lead to a mistake, and the two big palms would hit Zheng!</p>

  <p>But, when Zheng could not avoid Acalanatha's palms, he caught a glimpse out of the corner of his eye and was shocked!</p>

  <p>Lily began to rotate as soon as she held the Streamer Sword. At the same time, her malicious aura formed a helix, as if a storm were materializing around her, and then rushed to Patrick at high speed.</p>

  <p>She seemed to be dancing. And the sword was a prop in her dance— a dance that brought death...</p>

  <p>"W-ha-t, what is this sword trick?" Zheng was dazed.</p>

  <p>Although Lily was Zheng's sword spirit, he didn't know her. So far, Zheng had summoned her and then attached her to his sword.</p>

  <p>Aside from her enchanting appearance, Lily was no different from the other sword spirits Zheng had seen on the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Zheng had encountered a variety of sword spirits while at the Killing Sword Mountain. These varied from primary forms of sword spirits that had no shape at all, to only being points of light. And as Zheng climbed higher, the sword spirits became more advanced— many sword spirits had forms, of which the most common was the human form.</p>

  <p>Even so, these sword spirits were near-mindless. Basically, they could not speak, and their faces lacked expressions.</p>

  <p>Except for Iceni whom Zheng had encountered at the end. Iceni manipulated his sword spirit by injecting a touch of his soul into it.</p>

  <p>But there was no soul inside Lily. This was why Zheng felt strange when she used such an unusual attack skill after Zheng summoned her!</p>

  <p>As Lily spun faster and faster, the number of malicious aura spirals increased.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Patrick didn't care too much about Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>All he needed to do was concentrate on driving the body of Acalanatha.</p>

  <p>As for the sword spirit, even if she were holding the Streamer Sword, all Patrick had to do was dodge her attacks.</p>

  <p>It was beyond Patrick's expectation that Zheng's sword spirit could control a sword so skillfully.</p>

  <p>What was this sword trick? It was a dance! The difference was that Lily was using a sword trick in her sword dance. She had a real sword!</p>

  <p>Unsure of whether he could escape from Lily's unusual sword dance, Patrick had to withdraw a palm from his attack on Zheng and aim it at Lily.</p>

  <p>After one of the hands was withdrawn, the pressure on Zheng reduced.</p>

  <p>Patrick could not juggle two attacks simultaneously. So it was impossible for him to handle Zheng and his sword spirit at the same time. That was why Patrick decided to crush Lily first. That would earn him more time.</p>

  <p>The Acalanatha palm was extremely fast. Patrick envisioned the huge fingers would grab Lily in the blink of an eye, and then squeeze hard.</p>

  <p>However, Lily's intensity not only exceeded Patrick's imagination, but it also went far beyond Zheng's assumptions. Apparently, Lily was strong.</p>

  <p>Acalanatha's hand had smashed Tianming's Heavenly Punishment Sword once. But it was not impressive when compared with Lily's sword dance!</p>

  <p>As the Streamer Sword swirled in circles, its tip drew lines of malicious aura. The spiral-shaped malicious aura burst and covered Lily. She was like a hedgehog now. One could imagine what Acalanatha's palm would end up with!</p>

  <p>Not only was the huge palm smashed, but the fingers had also been cut off.</p>

  <p>And Lily did not stop there. Since Zheng had commanded her to attack, she wouldn't be still until she had reached her target, Patrick.</p>

  <p>Patrick felt helpless. He had not underestimated Zheng. On the contrary, although he had accurately estimated Zheng's strength, he hadn't been able to imagine everything Zheng was capable of.</p>

  <p>The first thing that surprised Patrick was Zheng's strength. He didn't know why Zheng?was so strong. Even his physical strength was beyond the limits of a human body. Where the hell did his strength come from?</p>

  <p>What was his secret?</p>

  <p>What astonished Patrick, even more, were the anomalies in Zheng's flesh.</p>

  <p>His body was in the Diamond-like state and was unlike human flesh!</p>

  <p>While these were two aspects that Patrick?could bring himself to accept, there was one beyond his understanding.</p>

  <p>Like Zheng's sword spirit. Patrick?could see that this sword spirit had formed not long ago. Zheng had been able to give a new-born sword spirit shape. Patrick could see that?Zheng?was a true talent and a rare opponent.</p>

  <p>Most ordinary people would be unable to match him.</p>

  <p>Even though he was able to give the sword spirit a form, how could she be that strong? A sword spirit with a sword trick? An unfathomable sword trick?</p>

  <p>Patrick?had nothing to say now...</p>

  <p>And Patrick was not the only one who was left speechless. So were the 100, 000 witnesses.</p>

  <p>Lily's long, straight, white legs gleamed among the spirals of malicious aura. Her face was expressionless but?young and beautiful as if she were a Valkyrie?sent down to Earth by God. Her sword dance was impressive, and so was her sword trick. Also, her dance was enchanting and moving.</p>

  <p>Nimble on her feet, Lily was not only gracious but as fierce as a dragon.</p>

  <p>Her long hair flew with her movements and covered half her face, like the lotus jade!</p>

  <p>Unable to defend against the sword dance, Patrick was forced to retreat.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, a fierce discussion began among the crowd.</p>

  <p>"I am jealous. Why the hell didn't something like this happen to me? I wish that I had such an?amazing sword spirit. I would spend my days just watching her!"</p>

  <p>"Jealous? I am more than jealous! I want to bow in worship to the sword spirit. Is she really?a sword spirit? Who can tell me whether or not she is a real sword spirit? She is a goddess!"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the best way to get a sword spirit like her. Dream! There may be a beautiful sword spirit in your dream! Do you want it in real life? Hum, not even in your next life!"</p>

  <p>Yan?kept an eye on the whole process. She bit her lip as she tried to control her erratic breathing. She was unsure of what Zheng?had gone through, and what changes had happened to him. These changes and experiences had?helped her elder brother to master endless ways of fighting, ways that could be used individually as a trump card if put on others!</p>

  <p>"My brother is too strong..."</p>

  <p>Tianming watched and shook his head again. Patrick's palms could?easily break his?Heavenly Punishment Sword, but it could do nothing to Zheng's sword spirit. This was too strange and hard to accept.</p>

  <p>In a way, Tianming's attitude was expected as Zheng had also used his sword spirit when fighting him. But Zheng had summoned Lily into his sword at that time and had been inspired by Lily's malicious aura when attacking his opponent.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Zheng didn't practice the skills of using malicious aura. And so, his application of the malicious aura was at a very low-level, and he had relied entirely on the power of the malicious aura to break the Heavenly Punishment?Sword.</p>

  <p>Lily knew sword tricks and used the power of the unusual sword dance to exert the malicious aura efficiently. This was what Zheng had not thought of doing.</p>

  <p>In other words, Lily seemed stronger than Zheng...</p>

  <p>Under the situation, Patrick was?finally forced to the edge of the fight field.</p>

  <p>Behind him was the light curtain formed by the enchanted barrier. He was left with only two options, accept defeat or face Lily's sword dance.</p>

  <p>In other words, he had no way back.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Lily was nearing, Patrick closed his palms again. There was a Buddha seal in his eye, a golden Buddha seal.</p>

  <p>"Suffering in the body?is good for the mind. Do not be shaken by the outside world. Allow no distraction in the heart..."</p>

  <p>Patrick?began chanting. As Lily's sword dance approached, he seemed to give up resistance.</p>

  <p>But the Buddha seal in his eye suddenly broke, and its contents filled the pupil of his right eye. It now appeared as though his right eye was shining with gold.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Patrick was about to make a big move.</p>

  <p>But Patrick had already applied the Acalanatha's virtual shadow. What else could be stronger than the Acalanatha's virtual shadow?</p>

  <p>Of course, after the golden light bloomed in his right eye, the right eye of the Acalanatha's virtual shadow?from behind him was also filled with the golden light. And under the shining golden light, the broken palm of?</p>

  <p>Acalanatha's virtual shadow was condensed again.</p>

  <p>The moment the palm was condensed, Patrick once again put his hands together. When he pulled them apart, a flame?appeared in his hands. It? was a black cyan flame.</p>

  <p>The action corresponded with the palm of the Acalanatha's virtual shadow— a bigger cyan flame appeared between the giant palms!</p>

  <p>"Green Lotus Karma Fire!"</p>
