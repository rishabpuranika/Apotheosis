<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Zheng's and Campbell's gaze shift somewhere else, all the others followed and looked towards the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>When their eyes met the man on the Pure Sky Platform, they were shocked.</p>

  <p>"Someone is there!"</p>

  <p>"That person looks the same as the black head!"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Those who could stay in the Jade Pure Realm were by no means, ordinary people.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him, Master Campbell?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Campbell stared at the Pure Sky Platform as if he was searching his mind for memories of this person.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the man on the Pure Sky Platform flashed a strange smile, and so did the black head. He stayed silent, allowing Campbell to think harder.</p>

  <p>As a world builder, Campbell focused on building one world after another, not caring about matters of the main world. When they encountered any trouble before building a world, they only needed to call the Ten Directions House.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors sent by the Ten Directions House would tidy up the messes for them.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the ones that the world builders had the most contact with were the people of the Ten Directions House.</p>

  <p>After he traced back his memories, something suddenly crossed Campbell's mind. He opened his eyes wide and pointed at the person opposite him. "I remember now. You are a member of the Ten Directions House. You are General Gianni!"</p>

  <p>Generals were powerful warriors in the Ten Directions House.</p>

  <p>There were many troubles in the main world, large or small– if the world builders occupied the territory of some races in building a world, or if they needed to destroy the gathering places of some barbaric races, they would need the Ten Directions House to help them.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, they would not need generals to show up since the strength of ordinary warriors of the Ten Directions House was enough to solve these problems.</p>

  <p>Once, a group of two hundred of them encountered the attack of the Tail Butterfly race. The two hundred builders were trapped, and the Ten Directions House sent three groups of warriors in succession but they all returned in failure. In the end, the Ten Directions House had to send six generals.</p>

  <p>It was Campbell's first time seeing a general of the Ten Directions House, and this Gianni was the leader of the group at the time.</p>

  <p>The six generals' strength was astonishing. All the members of the Tail Butterfly race were wiped out skillfully.</p>

  <p>Although Gianni had left a deep impression on Campbell, they had only met once. The black head had Gianni's face–Campbell remembered it now.</p>

  <p>"General Gianni, what exactly happened? Why had someone dared to kill us? I heard that even the Eternal Divine Courtyard has been abandoned.</p>

  <p>What happened inside the Four Spirits Sect?" Campbell demanded answers one by one.</p>

  <p>Campbell had been attacked by the big-head monsters, he was also attacked by the black head that was suspected to be controlled by Gianni...</p>

  <p>However, in his heart, he still regarded the Human Spirit Sect as his home and the Ten Directions House as something trustworthy.</p>

  <p>He could only believe a portion of Zheng's words and he wanted to verify it with Gianni.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." Gianni made a series of sounds and began to speak Sanskrit. "If I were you, I would kill all of them and then commit suicide. At least, the Whining Road is a safe place where you can still live."</p>

  <p>Zheng's and Campbell's faces both darkened at Gianni's words. Campbell asked again, "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"You are just a builder. Why do you have so many questions?" Gianni scolded him. "You just need to do as I say. I order you as a general of the Ten Directions House!"</p>

  <p>Some things had already been arranged in the first chaotic era. The reason why Gianni appeared was only to get rid of the variables to their plan.</p>

  <p>The world builders weren't strong, but they were too familiar with the chaos; thus, they could be considered one of the variables. That was why they had arranged many hostility-level Treacherous Beings here.</p>

  <p>Every time any world builder entered this place, they would be thrown back to the Whining Road by the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Campbell had won the battle with the hostility-level Treacherous Beings this time, which alerted Gianni.</p>

  <p>The generals of the Ten Directions House were existences enjoying high status in the main world.</p>

  <p>A single word from them often determined either the life or death of a large race.</p>

  <p>With Campbell's status, he could only obey their orders unconditionally.</p>

  <p>There was no way he dared to disobey.</p>

  <p>"Kill them and commit suicide?" Campbell murmured.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at Campbell calmly while he held the long spear in his hand tight. The silver-white Light of Annihilation slowly circulated the pattern of the spear's shaft, making its way to the tip. The Light of Annihilation could kill Campbell who was in the form of a Treacherous Being although he had already awakened.</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell, your wish was to wake up. Do you still want to return to the Whining Road, to become a soulless Treacherous Being and drift through your life?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Campbell glanced at Zheng and then looked at Gianni in the distance.</p>

  <p>He thought for a while before staring at Gianni with firmness. "General Gianni, I can return to the Whining Road, but please answer my questions first. Who on earth killed us, and why?"</p>

  <p>A look of contempt appeared in Gianni's eyes, the same with the eyes of the black head. "Who do you think you are? Do you think you have become a somebody after you slept for so many years?"</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Gianni's eyes began to flicker into a blood-red light, so did the black head's eyes. It was about to launch another wave of attacks, but before the red light could shoot out–"Pop, pop!" The two beams of silver spear radiance had once again pierced through its eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng placed the long spear back on his shoulder and said, "More than one thousand chaotic eras have passed, and perhaps forces like the Ten Directions House and the Human Spirit Sect no longer exist. It's better to find clues by yourself than to ask this guy!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice came from his inner world. His voice wasn't loud, but Gianni had heard him through the black head.</p>

  <p>In Gianni's eyes, the others were all irrelevant creatures except for the indestructible world builders.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had pierced through the eyes of the black head many times, Gianni thought it was only the Light of Annihilation which achieved such a feat, not Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! You think you can leave now?" Gianni asked teasingly.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't know unless we give it another try, right?" The silver light on Zheng's right hand began to radiate again.</p>

  <p>"A bug full of itself. I'll let you have another try..."</p>

  <p>As Gianni spoke, he took two steps toward the edge of the Pure Sky Platform. Round balls began to bulge from the skin around his neck as if eggs were moving from within.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the big-head monsters began to shake below the black head. They started merging and fused into a large mass that spread in all directions–gradually forming the body of a black giant!</p>

  <p>The black giant was over one hundred thousand feet tall and could cross the huge Pure Sky Platform in just ten steps.</p>

  <p>In the distance, Gianni also tore his clothes as he trembled slightly. One after another, cracks appeared on the surface of his body, giving rise to countless eyes opening all over his body.</p>

  <p>The black giant and Gianni moved in sync. Eyes also appeared on the surface of the black giant's body, and as they opened, the blood-red light began to gather again.</p>
