  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ramzi looked at Luo Zheng with a complicated look on his face. In a daze, he said, "I was absolutely right. His blood is pure and powerful, and his drop of blood devoured mine completely just moments ago. Even my blood power can't resist his. Only the imperial-grade bloodline can do that!"</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race was divided into nine tribes. That was how it got its name, in fact.</p>

  <p>The nine tribes were each respectively called Beginning Yi, Square Yi, Yellow Yi, White Yi, Red Yi, Wind Yi, Mystery Yi, Sun Yi, and Field Yi.</p>

  <p>In the past, when the Nine Li race was at its most prosperous period, each tribe was viewed as a behemoth in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Ramzi was a descendant of Wind Yi.</p>

  <p>Ramzi had given the Nine Li race in the bone tower a Blood Stone and thus defined their bloodlines, ranging from first to tenth-grade.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, even the tenth-grade bloodlines weren't really considered a big deal in the Source World.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, according to the Blood Stone, Ramzi's bloodline was at about grade thirteen.</p>

  <p>Although testing his blood power using the Blood Stone had been quite difficult, the power contained within his blood hadn't been enough to break the stone. Not even crack it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Adele had announced that the Blood Stone had been broken during Luo Zheng's blood test, it was only normal that he felt very surprised!</p>

  <p>Only the Nine Li race's eighty-one mages had bloodlines of a higher grade than Ramzi's. Their bloodlines could be considered of the fourteenth grade.</p>

  <p>That said, it didn't mean that their blood, despite being a higher grade, could devour Ramzi's easily.</p>

  <p>He might not be the strongest in terms of strength among these exiles, but he did have the highest-grade blood power among them. And only imperial-grade bloodlines could devour his blood with ease.</p>

  <p>After hearing Ramzi out, the old man stared at Luo Zheng for a brief moment before asking, "Kid, who are your parents?"</p>

  <p>First and foremost, Luo Zheng didn't completely trust the Nine Li members. He was always wary of everyone and in his mind, he always held onto a few misgivings. Ultimately, he was worried that these warriors had been taken to the prison because they had betrayed their race or had committed a grave mistake.</p>

  <p>However, upon entering the bone tower, he quickly noticed that the warriors here still treated Chiyou as their leader. Everyone who walked in would kneel down before him in worship.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's worries gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>"My mother's name is Lorena," Luo Zheng stated in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Lorena? Is that right?" The old man asked in reply, completely lost in thought.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that there is no such person in Nine Li race by that name.</p>

  <p>Nor have I even ever heard of anyone in the royal family named Lorena.</p>

  <p>Leopold, have you heard of this name anywhere before?" asked another man.</p>

  <p>Leopold was the youngest among the group. He had maintained his youthful appearance for countless years and among the Nine Li exiles, he was the last to be taken to this prison.</p>

  <p>As he heard Luo Zheng speak, Leopold descended silently from midair where he was hovering, and knelt down on one knee in front of him.</p>

  <p>The other exiles looked at one another, clearly confused by what was going on.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng was of the imperial-grade bloodline, there was no reason for Leopold to be so courteous toward him. His behavior was unexpected.</p>

  <p>"Leopold, what do you think you're doing?" Ramzi asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Leopold slowly looked up at Luo Zheng and said, "Before I was exiled, the royal family gave birth to a new female baby. The heavy rain fell on Jade Toad Mountain. The female baby was named Lorena. She is Grand Chieftain's youngest daughter. Grand Chieftain was so happy he ordered the nine tribes to celebrate the baby's birth for three consecutive months."</p>

  <p>As they heard what Leopold had to say, everyone immediately felt stunned. They all stared blankly at Luo Zheng and everyone had fallen mysteriously silent.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Before long, every single one of the exiles floating in the air had descended and was kneeling down silently in front of Luo Zheng. They were all on one knee, as though they were proposing.</p>

  <p>If this was all just because Luo Zheng had the imperial-grade bloodline, then it was clearly too much. He wasn't worthy of such behavior.</p>

  <p>There was a great difference, though, if Luo Zheng was Chiyou's grandson.</p>

  <p>Even Adele, the Grand Elder of the Nine Li race, knelt down without hesitation as soon as she saw her father doing so.</p>

  <p>The elders, including Giacomo and Erik, all knelt down in front of Luo Zheng, too. They worshiped him and paid him their respects.</p>

  <p>"Dad, who is that man? He must be important! Why does everyone kowtow to him?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask too many questions, my little boy. Just lower your head like everyone else."</p>

  <p>The people around the square were all confused of course, but they all prostrated themselves on the ground without a word of disagreement.</p>

  <p>Now, only Luo Zheng could be seen standing throughout the entire square.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt very uncomfortable with their sudden, overwhelming salute.</p>

  <p>"This..." he began. "Everyone, just please stand up!" He raised his tone of voice.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng exclaimed loudly, the oldest man among them slowly got to his feet and stared at Luo Zheng with a sad, indignant expression on his face. "Has our Nine Li race lost the battle?" he asked. "Why has the Grand Chieftain's grandchild also been exiled to this world?"</p>

  <p>In his eyes, the Nine Li race's royal family were the pride and joy of the entire race. Among those children, the descendants of Chiyou, the Grand Chieftain, were respected the most.</p>

  <p>Despite that, though, now, even the Grand Chieftain's grandson had been exiled into this world. One could imagine how difficult the Nine Li race's current situation really was!</p>

  <p>Leopold spoke to Luo Zheng. "Before I was exiled, the Nine Li race had been in grave danger. It was even said that Grand Chieftain wanted to fight against Yellow Emperor in Gilt Town. But I was exiled before that. And I know nothing of what happened after that. Please, tell us. Inform us all."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng understood. They thought that he too, had been exiled to this world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng froze and was silent for a moment as he realized that these people had misunderstood him. He then clarified, "I haven't been exiled into this world."</p>

  <p>"What? You weren't exiled here?" The oldest man was surprised. "Then how did you get to this world?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>The others looked at each other, puzzled expressions pulling at their features.</p>

  <p>Other than being exiled, was there really any other way to enter this world?</p>

  <p>This place was incredibly far from the Source World, and with Luo Zheng's cultivation base, it was even less possible for him to cross such a long distance.</p>

  <p>In the crowd, someone's eyes lit up as the person asked, "Did you travel here with the ship above Torrent Bone Tower?"</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods in the world had detected that ship a long time ago, at least. They were fully aware of its existence.</p>

  <p>At the time of its discovery, they had noticed that the giant ship was landing at an extremely fast speed, and it was estimated that it would crash into the world in just a few years.</p>

  <p>No one knew who had built the ship exactly, but all the races had been preparing for its crash. As soon as it did, they had the intentions of rushing up and plundering everything within.</p>

  <p>The resources within this world were extremely rare. Other than relying on the wild bones for cultivation, nearly no other cultivation resources existed here.</p>

  <p>Every race paid close attention to the ship and a detailed plan had been put together by the Nine Li race. They had determined the exact spot of the ship's landing, and they were always ready to go and collect a few benefits from it.</p>

  <p>However, not long ago, an accident had occurred on the ship and it had soared up into the air, above the chaos, in a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Snake Goddess race, which was the most powerful race in this world, had bound the ship above the Torrent Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>The oldest man and Ramzi, along with Leopold, all kept a close watch on Luo Zheng. It was highly possible that Luo Zheng had arrived here through the ship.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng nodded in a simple reply. "My mother told me that the ship was created by Chiyou himself. I wasn't born in the Source World, but on that ship. As for the Source World's current situation, it's almost the same as what you have been led to believe. The Nine Li race has indeed been defeated, and for this reason, my grandfather made the ship so that the warriors could escape."</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng explained the truth, the exiles quickly changed the looks on their faces.</p>
