  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words brought a trace of admiration on the faces of Miguel and everyone else. Here was a man at his finest! They knew that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't going to let the Life and Death Realm master take his own life, but this was perhaps the most important test the warrior could ever face.</p>

  <p>When the Life and Death Realm master heard Luo Zheng's words, his eyes gleamed and gradually became clear. He looked like a normal person right now, but at Luo Zheng's command, he suddenly stretched out his hands and gathered his green life vitality. The life vitality condensed into many sharp thorns which were about to hit his own head.</p>

  <p>Considering his strength, one thing was sure: if he slapped his head with his hand, he would definitely die.</p>

  <p>In the nick of time, Luo Luo Zheng flatly ordered, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>When the Life and Death Realm master heard Luo Zheng's order, his hand froze in midair. He looked at the latter inquiringly, as if waiting for Luo Luo Zheng to issue the next order, almost like a man possessed.</p>

  <p>"Don't kill yourself. Tell me your name," Luo Luo Zheng coolly ordered him.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Realm master nodded and complied, "My name is Francis Cao."</p>

  <p>"Alright. Francis Cao, follow me." After Luo Luo Zheng had finished speaking, he flew downwards without looking back, as if he was certain that Francis Cao wouldn't refuse his orders. Without hesitation, Francis Cao nodded and followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>The slave seal he had on him was very powerful and unique. Once enslaved, a warrior wouldn't lose himself and get turned into a puppet. In fact, he would still have his own consciousness. As long as Luo Luo Zheng did not give any unusual orders, he would act like a normal person and no one would be able to see anything wrong from him.</p>

  <p>However, come what may, he could not disobey Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>In less than two hours, the greatest crisis in the history of the Central Region was easily resolved.</p>

  <p>Dillon and the others were highly relieved now.</p>

  <p>They didn't have anything to worry about anymore. Since the very moment when Miguel had led a group of masters to the Central Region, those members of the York Divine Kingdom were doomed!</p>

  <p>In fact, Dillon and the others were now a hundred percent certain that Luo Luo Zheng had now practically become the leader of the Central Region, even if he didn't want to be. He had no choice but to admit this fact, even though he did not have the ambition to establish a divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng could beat anyone in the Central Region if he brought out his own strength, not to mention the one hundred powerful masters from the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Every single warrior in the Central Region knew as much. They only had to put two and two together to confirm that Luo Luo Zheng was the most powerful person in the Central Region right now.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng didn't have the ambition to unify the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if he tried to establish a divine kingdom, who would be able to go up against him?</p>

  <p>However, what they did not know was that Luo Luo Zheng did have an ambition. In fact, Luo Zheng's ambition was greater than that of anyone in the Central Region and was beyond their imagination. His goal was not limited to this great world. He knew his future lay in the entire universe!</p>

  <p>However, he was only quietly keeping this goal in his heart.</p>

  <p>After defeating the warriors of the York Divine Kingdom, Miguel and the other masters didn't seem to be in any hurry to return to the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Miguel and the warriors of the Demon Night were truly infatuated with the various delicacies and cultures of Oracle City. Since Amber was looking over the Sea God Continent now, they didn't have to worry about it anymore, and they all seized the chances they could to enjoy the peaceful, relaxing moments in the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't wait any longer. He wasn't sure how long Ning Yudie could hold on, but the earlier he set out to look for life stones to save her, the more hope he had of her being okay. Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng decided to go to the four divine kingdoms after seven days.</p>

  <p>When Miguel heard Luo Zheng's plan, he also wanted to send several masters in the latter's wake.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng refused.</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms were supposed to be even more powerful than the Sea God Continent itself, with countless masters guarding them.</p>

  <p>Leading a group of warriors right into the four great divine kingdoms would only lead to more trouble. This was not the result that Luo Luo Zheng wanted to see.</p>

  <p>Right now, he only wanted to obtain enough life stones to rescue Ning Yudie and he had no intention of fighting with anyone of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>After all, he didn't have much of a grudge with anyone in that area.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had been insistent in his refusal, Miguel did not force anything.</p>

  <p>He and the other warriors decided to go back to the Sea God Continent when Luo Luo Zheng left.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not send Ning Yudie back to the Cloud Hall. Although the Cloud Hall was safe for now, there were still some clans ready to make a move on the first chance they got. Since Luo Luo Zheng was currently in the Central Region and was able to suppress them, no one was daring enough to act rashly but if he left the Central Region, those clans might make a move. After all, people's greed increased with time.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Dillon and the others did not have any conflict with Ning Yudie and judging by the current situation of the Central Region, they were surely able to protect her.</p>

  <p>Seven days later, Luo Luo Zheng and Mu Ning stayed in the Heavenly Stellar Palace.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning leaned lightly against Luo Zheng's back, her face full of reluctance.</p>

  <p>During the time that Mu Ning had stayed in the Heavenly Stellar Palace with Luo Luo Zheng, she had been slightly jealous of Ning Yudie on seeing Luo Luo Zheng sigh for her and be depressed due to her condition. But she also felt sorry for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that she didn't have the strength to change anything. She could only accept fact that this man was going to risk his life for another woman...</p>

  <p>The masters of the four divine kingdoms were at least a hundred times more powerful than those of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Even though Mu Ning wasn't interested in the martial arts, she knew very well that Luo Zheng's trip was full of danger.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, can I come with you?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning asked, trying to make her voice sound softer. Perhaps this way, Luo Luo Zheng would agree to her proposal.</p>

  <p>Over the last few days, other than looking after Luo Luo Zheng, Mu Ning also frequently went into the Purple Power World to cultivate. She did not like the process, so this boring cultivation thing was a type of torture for her, but she was very clear about her own potential.</p>

  <p>As long as Mu Ning cultivated to a certain level and paid a certain price, she would be able to communicate with the true spirit.</p>

  <p>The true spirit of the Purple Power World possessed the power to turn everything to dust. If Luo Luo Zheng encountered danger in the four great divine kingdoms, she could at least help him!</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Luo Zheng responded, firmly refusing her without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had already expected that Luo Luo Zheng would reject her offer. She didn't look even the least bit angry, but continued to speak with her soft voice,</p>

  <p>"Just let me come with you this time, okay?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let out a breath and turned his head to look at Mu Ning. He gently caressed her soft face and smiled. "Any time but this time!"</p>

  <p>Only then did Mu Ning curl her lips and grudgingly mutter, "I wonder when I can have a chance and when the next time will come..."</p>

  <p>"It won't be long," Luo Luo Zheng said soothingly.</p>

  <p>Facing Mu Ning, Luo Luo Zheng now had a faint feeling of affection. This woman might not be as agile as Ning Yudie and Xun. In the beginning, she was very arrogant, making people feel extremely disgusted with her. But after she had changed her character, she had become very attractive.</p>

  <p>She lowered her head, thinking of something. After a while, something seemed to strike her mind, so she suddenly raised her head and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Fine, you must promise me one thing for next time!"</p>

  <p>"What can I promise you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No matter what request I make, you must agree to it!" Mu Ning replied with a smile, though there was a serious expression on her elegant face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart raced for a while when he saw Xi Youqin's expression, and he immediately nodded his head.</p>

  <p>All the warriors in Oracle City, regardless of whether they were a part of the World Commercial Alliance or not, walked out of their houses and looked up at the sky. Today was the day that one hundred masters would leave the city.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance had to send them off personally.</p>

  <p>However, what surprised everyone was the fact that Miguel and the other warriors didn't accept any precious gifts for themselves. They also refused to accept the numerous treasures that the World Commercial Alliance had gifted them.</p>

  <p>After all, a low-grade sacred weapon that was treated as a treasure in the Central Region was a very common treasure in Miguel's eyes. Thus they of course didn't have any interest in the things that the World Commercial Alliance had given them.</p>

  <p>But what made people even more astonished was that Miguel actually packed a lot of ingredients from the Central Region with him and even asked the World Commercial Alliance for a few famous chefs...</p>

  <p>These chefs were also warriors, but they were only at the nature level. Even the most powerful one was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Upon learning that they could go to another continent to prepare food for those Soul Sea Realm masters, those chefs gladly agreed. They had been working hard in the World Commercial Alliance their whole lives, and they were only chefs. If they could serve these Soul Sea Realm masters well, perhaps the latter would be pleased and might give them a chance to break through. For the chefs, this was a rare opportunity.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng left, he looked deeply at Ning Yudie who was lying on the bed. But once he left the Heavenly Stellar Palace, all the sadness and disappointment disappeared from his face, replaced by a resolute expression!</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng brought Francis Cao, who had been enslaved by him, to meet with Miguel and the others. They then rushed towards the eastern side of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Miguel and the others returned to the Sea God Continent. As for Luo Luo Zheng, he took advantage of the small period of time when the storm stopped raging on the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. He immediately decided to cross it and enter the territory of the four great divine kingdoms.</p>
