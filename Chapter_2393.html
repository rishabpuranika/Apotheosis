<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2393 Truth Of Cultivation Nature </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The 3, 000 Godly Ways have their own rules and are very different,"</p>

  <p>Joy recited.</p>

  <p>"But in the end, they all follow the natural course.</p>

  <p>It's called the Truth of Cultivation Nature."</p>

  <p>As she murmured these words, a realization hit her.</p>

  <p>Her slender fingers moved, causing strength source and streaks of purple aura to flow out of her body and fill the side hall.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, Joy was an absolute authority on the Purple Aura Godly Way.</p>

  <p>It was the perfect Godly Way to make an array.</p>

  <p>When the predecessors of the Purple Aura Godly Way had cultivated it, they had nurtured all kinds of living beings using the purple aura and then set up all kinds of arrays.</p>

  <p>Then, with Mike's help, Joy had tried to spread their ideas to the world.</p>

  <p>The Four Swords Change in the Gods Killing Sword Array was the foundation.</p>

  <p>The Thirty-Two Swords Change was a little more complicated and fierce.</p>

  <p>The Ninety-Six Swords Change, which had the maximum power, was the final and perfect form of the Gods Killing Sword Array. The variables and killing intent in it were all extremely horrible.</p>

  <p>In addition to the sword arrays, Joy also had other arrays like the Beasts and Dragons Array, the Bird Dream Array, and the Purple Spirit Strife Array under her belt.</p>

  <p>In order to maximize the power of the Purple Aura Godly Way, Joy had been working hard to build an even larger array by trying to perfectly match the Purple Aura Godly Way with the strength source.</p>

  <p>It was a massive project as there would be a lot more variables involved than in the previous arrays.</p>

  <p>Even for her, it would be an extremely difficult task to build such an array.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she hadn't made much progress even though she'd been working on it for a long time.</p>

  <p>"It's difficult if one is obsessed. If you are too eager, you will only be stuck. If you spend too much time thinking, you will only have empty thoughts..." she continued reciting.</p>

  <p>"No obsession, no eagerness, no empty thoughts...</p>

  <p>Only then will you reach self-realization."</p>

  <p>Joy was no longer controlling the purple aura, nor was she shaping the strength source. She just let them float on their own in the side hall.</p>

  <p>As she recited the words, a strange idea popped into her mind.</p>

  <p>Invisible strength and purple aura were slowly flowing through the side hall. Sometimes, the purple aura enveloped the strength, and other times, the strength pushed the purple aura away.</p>

  <p>Like the clouds in the sky, the purple aura sometimes turned into galloping horses, and sometimes into gods and ghosts— all sorts of strange and bizarre figures.</p>

  <p>"Although the arrays are mysterious, they emerge from the mind.</p>

  <p>When it comes to mystery, what in this world can be compared to the mystery of nature?"</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>At this moment, the purple aura and the strength source began to blend with each other and lose shape as they slowly circled around Joy.</p>

  <p>"This is also an array..."</p>

  <p>As Joy watched this scene, her eyes lit up with excitement.</p>

  <p>Even though the array didn't seem to have a shape, it would be full of killing intent after a little change. If she poured more strength source and more purple aura into it, the power of this array would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>"The name of this array..." Joy frowned after pondering over it for a while. It seemed that the formless array had suddenly lost its killing intent. It turned into a mess and had no natural rhythm at all.</p>

  <p>She patted her own forehead and shook her head with a smile. "This is the will of nature. If I impose a name on it, it will have a form and a restraint, and it will even lose its nature..."</p>

  <p>Then, she dispersed the purple aura and the strength source and gently put aside the Truth of Godly Way deciphered by Geoffrey before opening the door of the side hall.</p>

  <p>Half a month had passed.</p>

  <p>When she opened the door, a ray of morning light shot in. The world that she saw was no longer the same as before. The trees, sun, and the fish in the pond all contained a natural law and a sense of truth now.</p>

  <p>Only handmade structures like the pavilions, the terraces, and the towers looked dull.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>In the pavilion beside the pond, dressed in white clothing, Geoffrey was practicing with a spear.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey and the spear were both ordinary, but Joy was nevertheless surprised when she saw him thrust his spear into the air.</p>

  <p>Joy thought that although Geoffrey was good at the art of spear fighting, he wasn't excellent yet. However, there was a faint trace of Truth of Cultivation Nature in his movements, and it was this wisp of Truth of Cultivation Nature that made Geoffrey's spear fighting extraordinary.</p>

  <p>'That makes sense. He has deciphered the Truth of Godly Way and can recite over a thousand words of it. So, he partly understands that Truth of Cultivation Nature. This kid is only 16 years old. Although his cultivation base is not that high, he can understand a little bit of the Truth of Godly Way. In the future when he grows up, he might become even more powerful than his father...' Joy marveled inwardly.</p>

  <p>As she approached him, she saw that his face was red with anger. With a curious look, she asked, "Geoffrey, where's your father?"</p>

  <p>"He's sleeping!"</p>

  <p>Then, Geoffrey continued to wave his spear, which whistled like a wheel.</p>

  <p>He had thought that the fairy palace would become more lively following his father's return.</p>

  <p>However, on the contrary, his mother along with Aunt Xun and Aunt Aura all followed his father around and didn't bother to talk to him anymore.</p>

  <p>Xun, in particular, didn't even practice spear fighting with him these days.</p>

  <p>"He is still sleeping?"</p>

  <p>Joy raised her head and looked at the sky. Although it was morning, the sun was already shining high in the sky. It was not that early in the day.</p>

  <p>Understanding why Geoffrey looked so angry, Joy smiled helplessly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just returned to the fairy palace and reunited with his several beautiful wives again, so naturally, he hadn't had a good rest last night.</p>

  <p>But as a True God, his energy was almost inexhaustible. It was odd that he was still unable to get up.</p>

  <p>'Young people indeed have no restraint...'</p>

  <p>With a sigh, Joy jumped onto the platform, wiggled her waist, and smiled. "Let me keep you company to practice!"</p>

  <p>"How will you do that? You don't even have a weapon," he said, looking at her in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Come on, just attack me," she said flatly.</p>

  <p>Without any more hesitation, Geoffrey thrust his long spear at her like a viper.</p>

  <p>Considering Geoffrey's current cultivation base, the spear fighting skills that he displayed were quite impressive.</p>

  <p>Yet a few months ago, Xun hadn't even wanted to waste her time practicing with him. After all, when a world lord fought with an Internal Elixir Realm warrior, it was not like the difference between an adult and a child; it was simply the difference between human and dust. They were incomparable.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the beginning, every time Xun had attacked, she had casually knocked his spear away before gently knocking him down.</p>

  <p>But ever since Geoffrey had deciphered the six golden Sanskrit words, the situation had been different.</p>

  <p>The first time Geoffrey had managed to hurt Xun with his spear, she had been caught off guard.</p>

  <p>Although she had always suppressed her cultivation to the Internal Elixir Realm, she had still been shocked.</p>

  <p>After that, Xun had begun to take this "little opponent" seriously and had spared no effort while sparring with him.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, she had still been able to suppress Geoffrey with her moves.</p>

  <p>However, as Geoffrey deciphered more and more words of the Truth of Godly Way, his understanding became more and more profound, and he was able to have an even battle with Xun now.</p>

  <p>At the thrust of his spear, Joy turned around.</p>

  <p>She didn't move very fast or think much about it. Her body was as gentle as the wind, so she naturally avoided the spear.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey sensed a trace of the Truth of Godly Way emitting from Joy, but hers was much more profound than his.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey knew that sparring with an opponent like this would benefit him a lot.</p>

  <p>He had a slight knowledge of the Truth of Godly Way, but he was able to comprehend it even more now from Joy's skills.</p>

  <p>An Internal Elixir Realm secondary creature sparring with a Demi-holy Being was indeed a rare scene.</p>

  <p>"Godly Ways follow the natural course; the understanding of them demands perseverance. All Godly Ways follow the natural course.</p>

  <p>There is no other way to comprehend the Godly Ways."</p>

  <p>As Geoffrey thrust his spear, he became more enlightened and then tried to recite the Truth of Godly Way. Hearing his recitation, Joy smiled and started to recite it too.</p>
