<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the surface, it looked like this piece of mud was an ordinary object, scattered all over the outskirts of the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immersed his consciousness into it, but didn't discover anything out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>If this really was an ordinary piece of mud, putting it in his inner world wouldn't cause any trouble at all.</p>

  <p>As this thought crossed his mind, Luo Luo Zheng inwardly said to Master Evil, "I need to meditate and cultivate now."</p>

  <p>Master Evil rolled his eyes and shrunk his soul into a ball. Strands of purple light flashed on the surface of his soul and condensed to form the word 'seal'. He had sealed his soul on his own.</p>

  <p>This seal could only be undone from the outside. Luo Luo Zheng would release Master Evil's soul once he finished his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had earlier told Master Evil that he would not allow anyone to spy on him while he was cultivating.</p>

  <p>Back in the Misty Mountain Village, Luo Luo Zheng had neglected this important point because he was too anxious to suppress the Evil God. But at the time, Master Evil's soul had also been on the verge of collapsing, which was why he hadn't tried to pry into Luo Zheng's inner world. There were some secrets that Master Evil knew but it was not as big a deal as to make an impact. Luo Luo Zheng was cautious at the moment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took the piece of mud in his hands and placed it in front of his belly.</p>

  <p>As he activated his cinnabar field, a faint light flowed out of his abdomen, forming a short passage between his inner world and the divine land.</p>

  <p>The consciousness within his inner world was still restless, continuously urging Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was hesitant as he looked at the brown mud. But it was not long before all his hesitation disappeared from his face. With a wave of his hands, the mud disappeared from his hands.</p>

  <p>In the inner world... the dust condensed in the sky, and before long, had turned into an incarnation of Luo Luo Zheng. He looked up in time to see a black dot fall from the sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had now personally entered his inner world.</p>

  <p>He flew towards the mud at the same descending speed as the mud's, keeping a close eye on its movements.</p>

  <p>But the piece of mud continued to roll down and fall.</p>

  <p>As it gathered speed, it began to disintegrate into bits and pieces in the air.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the mud finally fell into the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>The mud was the exact same color as the brown chaotic sea. It had disappeared without a trace, but Luo Luo Zheng could still feel its presence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood motionlessly on the surface of the chaotic sea and quietly observed the changes within.</p>

  <p>With a swooshing sound, a figure rapidly approached Luo Luo Zheng from a distance in the sky.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had made an appearance.</p>

  <p>Once the Evil God had dissolved his sacred place, he had become a hidden cultivator. He had succeeded in erasing any traces of his existence in this world. Well, almost. As the creatures multiplied with each generation, fewer and fewer creatures knew of the existence of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Creator!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God bowed respectfully towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "Please rise."</p>

  <p>"Why did you come here?" the Evil God asked respectfully.</p>

  <p>Once the Evil God had submitted to Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Luo Zheng imparted some very valuable experience to him.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, the Evil God had occupied all the continents in the world. Only the gigantic World Tree and the ice tree at the other end of the world had remained untouched by him. The Evil God could not enter the Savage Ice Plain where the ice tree was located, as the ice flames froze everything within the plain.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had taught him the cultivation method for the Ice Soul Flame, he had stayed in the Savage Ice Plain to cultivate. Although he hadn't completely comprehended the Ice Soul Flame yet, the profound Law Power had broadened his horizon.</p>

  <p>"I have found something that might be very helpful for this world," said Luo Luo Zheng, staring at the turbulent brown sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not sure about the effects of the mud, but he could tell from the information he received from his inner world that his judgment would probably not be wrong.</p>

  <p>"Very helpful?" The Evil God's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>Before fighting Luo Luo Zheng, the Evil God had understood that there was a limit to him in this world. When he reached the Spirit Supreme Realm, it was as if he had already reached the limit of his cultivation level. That was not a limitation of his abilities. It was a bottleneck of the world that it did not allow him to become stronger.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God speculated that there should still be two greater realms above the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had spared his life, he had finally solved the puzzle in the Evil God's mind. There was indeed a Spirit Transformation Realm and a realm of world lords after one reached the Spirit Supreme Realm. Being a world lord was not the end of one's cultivation.</p>

  <p>Only when Luo Zheng's own cultivation base became stronger and the world within his inner world became larger would the Evil God have the qualification to advance further.</p>

  <p>That was why the Evil God was overjoyed at Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>A bubble arose from the sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flickered, as the Evil God stared fixedly at the bubbles.</p>

  <p>"Plop, plop..."</p>

  <p>Huge bubbles continued to noisily pop up from the depths of the chaotic Sea.</p>

  <p>A huge fish flew out of the sea with a splash, frightened at the noise.</p>

  <p>It flapped and rolled in the air before falling back in and swimming towards the depth of the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of small fish were swimming frantically in every direction, instinctively feeling that this place was now in danger of disaster.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had known when the mud had dissolved into fine sand and merged into the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>These blisters were the result of the fusion of the mud and the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>As the number of bubbles increased, the sounds became louder and louder.</p>

  <p>The bubbles rose and spread such that Luo Luo Zheng was at the center and the sea within a radius of a hundred thousand feet around him was filled with the bubbles, looking like it was boiling.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God was confused. He had always been conceited, and it didn't matter that he had submitted to Luo Luo Zheng. He still thought that he was smarter than him. It was just that his experience and knowledge had restricted his talent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. "I'm not sure either. The world just told me that it needs it."</p>

  <p>"Does this world... speak to you?" As a native of Luo Zheng's inner world, the Evil God wasn't sure but he knew that this world seemed to have its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled but did not answer the Evil God's question. Instead, he continued to pay attention to the strange scene unfolding before him. He had already discovered some subtle changes.</p>

  <p>After the bubbles appeared, tiny droplets of water began to slowly rise into the air. These droplets of water were tiny and no one could see them.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng could feel them with his omniscient ability.</p>

  <p>The bubbles were releasing these tiny droplets of water, continuously rising, converging and creating a mist in the sky.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" the Evil God asked in surprise when he saw the misty object in the sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and replied, "You can call it a cloud."</p>

  <p>The inner world that Luo Luo Zheng had built was actually incomplete and was somewhat different from the divine land in essence. The biggest difference was that everything within the divine land was transformed by the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>For example, a tree in the divine land was an ordinary creature because it was formed from the chaotic energy. But it wouldn't return to the chaotic energy once it dissolved.</p>

  <p>Moreover, to the creatures of the divine land, the chaotic energy was an extremely poisonous substance that they couldn't resist. Only Holy Beings and divine trees could resist the corrosive power of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The creatures within Luo Zheng's inner world, on the other hand, were born directly from the chaotic sea. This chaotic sea was liquefied chaotic energy. These creatures frequently touched the chaotic energy and weren't eroded.</p>

  <p>This meant that the chaotic sea did not transform into ordinary seawater, and the liquefied chaotic energy would not evaporate. There were naturally no clouds in this world, and the Evil God obviously did not know what a cloud was either.</p>

  <p>"Is that a cloud?" the Evil God muttered as he stared at the cloud in the sky that gradually became denser as time passed.</p>

  <p>The water droplets continued to condense, the brown cloud became thicker, and the light in Luo Zheng's eyes became brighter. He had never thought that the problem that had puzzled him for so long would be solved by a piece of mud!</p>
