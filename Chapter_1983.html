<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1983 Looking For Someone </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The scene in front of the Demon Night world lord was certainly something that she did not expect.</p>

  <p>This strange human youth survived, but he didn't use any theurgy at all!</p>

  <p>He did not use the protective life vitality nor other skills to protect him.</p>

  <p>She had successfully hit him with her arrow within a distance of less than 100 feet. Yet there he was, perfectly undamaged.</p>

  <p>The man who was supposed to have died in the huge pit was alive. Was he a human or a monster?</p>

  <p>He slowly rose from the huge pit and walked forward. Fannie didn't feel any killing intent from him.</p>

  <p>What she didn't know was Luo Zheng didn't actually want to engage in a senseless massacre. Even if Murphy had created the Demon Night race, they all grew up together in the same universe and became one with it.</p>

  <p>They were a part of the universe literally and figuratively.</p>

  <p>Now, the key to the Demon Night race lay in the Soul-sealing Needles buried deep in the three queens' souls.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wouldn't think twice about killing his opponent if they happened to be a Sacred world lord. However, he wouldn't take action if they were a member of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>"Don't attack again, I mean no harm," Luo Zheng said as he walked towards the woman. Fannie kept a tight grip on her longbow. Her body was as tense as a tightly drawn bowstring as her feet shuffled on the ground.</p>

  <p>Her movements were a unique footwork of the archers. She constantly moved backwards as Luo Zheng moved forward, careful to maintain a distance of about 100 feet from him.</p>

  <p>However, she did not fire a third arrow. If the first two arrows couldn't damage this young man, could the third arrow kill him?</p>

  <p>At that point, she was quite at a loss.</p>

  <p>She had already identified Luo Zheng as an enemy, which meant she had to attack him with all her strength.</p>

  <p>Yet, she didn't feel any hostility from him, which she also found strange.</p>

  <p>"Those who trespass on Prison Island will die! What's your purpose?!"</p>

  <p>Fannie demanded and remained vigilant.</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for someone," Luo Zheng replied as he walked.</p>

  <p>"All the prisoners on Prison Island are here by the queens' orders. There's no one you're looking for. Stop!" Fannie shouted.</p>

  <p>Even if she threatened him with warnings and her weapon, Luo Zheng didn't seem bothered.</p>

  <p>He simply continued to walk at an even pace.</p>

  <p>Just then, Fannie suddenly heard a life vitality message. "Let's attack together and kill him!" said the voice.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the one who had spoken was the other world lord of the Demon Night race on the Prison Island, Sammy.</p>

  <p>Sammy was slightly stronger compared to Fannie.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they might have a chance against Luo Zheng if they worked together.</p>

  <p>Fannie was also a decisive person. She immediately acted once she had made a final decision.</p>

  <p>Dust was swept off the ground as her speed was suddenly increased by several times. She moved backwards as the two ends of her longbow expanded, where six black blades appeared. The longbow looked like it had unfurled its wings as a ray of light illuminated its surface.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>Her fingertip glowed a golden light, then it turned into a short golden arrow.</p>

  <p>The golden arrow made a slight clicking noise before golden wind blades appeared and encircled it.</p>

  <p>"Perfection Storm Arrow!"</p>

  <p>Thanks to her comprehension of the profound mysteries of the ninth layer of the Wind Law, she was able to perfectly fuse them into her archery.</p>

  <p>Woo! Woo! Woo!</p>

  <p>The golden wind blades spun around the golden arrow like a turbine and emitted a sound that resembled the howling of wolves.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The bowstring was pulled taut, and then the arrow flew forwards in a straight line towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Are you still not dodging?"</p>

  <p>Fannie had created the Perfection Storm Arrow herself. She was extremely proud of it as it was also her strongest attack.</p>

  <p>However, she began to have second thoughts after she fired that arrow.</p>

  <p>While she hoped that she could hit and kill Luo Zheng, she was also worried about this monster's terrifying defensive abilities. If her arrow hit him straight on the head but he would still be unharmed, she would definitely be frustrated.</p>

  <p>But just as Fannie fired her arrow, a black figure appeared.</p>

  <p>The black figure wore a black, skin-tight nightgown. It left a blurry shadow-like image before it disappeared completely, like a ghost.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the golden arrow quickly hit Luo Zheng straight on the chest.</p>

  <p>The golden wind blades that circled the arrow wrapped around Zheng's body like a shadow. Then, they began to cut and slice into his body like mad!</p>

  <p>At the same time, that black figure appeared again behind Luo Zheng without a sound. The figure held a silver dagger and stabbed Zheng's back.</p>

  <p id="top_6">At that moment, Zheng's whole body was entirely covered with golden wind blades. World lords considered those golden wind blades to be extremely powerful. However, they wouldn't damage the black figure since the black figure had sneaked into the back of the world.</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>The short silver dagger dug into Zheng's back. A crisp sound was heard, but even his clothes remained undamaged.</p>

  <p>The wind blades dissipated and the black shadow retreated. The figure stood side by side with Fannie.</p>

  <p>While the black figure was dressed in all black, the exposed skin was alabaster. She was the other world lord who guarded the Prison Island, Sammy.</p>

  <p>She raised her head to meet Zheng's eyes in a serious stare.</p>

  <p>She had a deep understanding of assassination and had coordinated with Fannie to try to kill the human youth in a single strike. She had an accurate grasp of about everything related to stealth murder, whether it was timing or speed.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect that even this person's clothes hadn't been pierced through.</p>

  <p>"You two, you can stop now. I'm really just here to look for someone,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said as the smile on his face began to fade a little.</p>

  <p>The two world lords of the Demon Night race now held no anger towards this invulnerable world lord. Fannie clearly understood their disparity in strength, so she asked, "Who are you looking for?"</p>

  <p>"Her name is Amber, and she is imprisoned on this island," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Amber?" Sammy arched one fine brow.</p>

  <p>Those who were imprisoned in the Prison Island were not ordinary, but there were a few exceptions. The two world lords clearly knew about Amber because among those who had been sentenced to the punishment of corrosion, Amber had the lowest cultivation level, being only at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Except her, most were at the Spirit Transformation Realm. There were even a few world lords.</p>

  <p>Back when Amber was first brought to the prison, many of them felt odd after they knew that she was a newly-ascended warrior. They all wondered how this newly-ascended warrior offended their queen.</p>

  <p>"Why are you looking for her?" Fannie asked. Luo Zheng smiled, "To save her, of course."</p>

  <p>"Prisoners on the Prison Island are only qualified to be taken away at the queens' personal orders," Sammy interjected in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>"You aren't strong enough to stop me," Luo Zheng replied. At those words, the two world lords quickly turned silent.</p>

  <p>This human youth in front of them was strangely calm.</p>

  <p>They had already used their most powerful moves on him without holding back.</p>

  <p>Yet, he never once showed any intention of retaliating at all.</p>

  <p>He wasn't exaggerating; they truly were no match to him.</p>

  <p>"Even if we aren't, we won't give up," Sammy said in a tone even firmer than Fannie's.</p>

  <p>Although all the elites of the Demon Night race were out in the war, as the guardians of the Prison Island, they would not cower in the face of an intruder.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Fannie just looked at Luo Zheng. After she had fully sized him up, she suddenly felt that this human youth's voice was quite familiar.</p>

  <p>He had a world lord's cultivation level, and possessed such terrifying strength at only a young age. There weren't many warriors like him in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Fannie asked. Luo Zheng smiled. He had no intention of hiding anything at all.</p>

  <p>"I am  Luo Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>'Hmmm, it makes sense now, ' Fannie thought.</p>

  <p>Her guess was verified; he really was the famed young warrior, Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Sammy stared at Luo Zheng in a daze. She knew that his voice had often echoed throughout the universe. Moreover, his grudge towards Yao was also well-known.</p>

  <p>However, the most important thing was that Luo Zheng had another queen of the Demon Night race with him.</p>

  <p>"Don't resist. It's meaningless. I don't want to implicate the innocent,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said. His calm gaze swept over the two women before he turned around and chose a direction to walk in.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult to find Amber through the will of worlds, so he was very clear about her location.</p>

  <p>The two world lords behind him briefly looked at each other, and finally decided to give up. They no longer attacked Luo Zheng but at the same time, the human youth piqued their curiosity.</p>

  <p>This should be Zheng's first time on the Prison Island, so why was he able to pinpoint where Amber was?</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had travelled through miles of the soldering iron pillars, he finally stopped in front of one huge soldering iron pillar.</p>

  <p>Tied onto the iron pillar's surface was Amber, whose entire body was covered with corrosion marks. Her long hair reached the ground and her eyes were tightly shut. Upon closer inspection, Luo Zheng saw that her soul had also weakened.</p>

  <p>When he saw her appearance, guilt bubbled up in his chest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had given Amber hope and had promised that he would take her out of the hellish prison in three years, but his past situation and strength did not allow him to do so. And so, Amber had suffered for much longer.</p>
