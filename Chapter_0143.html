<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 143 Half-step Into The Nature Level (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng positioned himself as per the illustration in the Heavenly Ogre Fist book.</p>

  <p>Since this was a refinement method for Ogres, it would take human beings a lot of time, energy, and effort to master if they cultivated diligently.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Luo Luo Zheng was physically stronger than ordinary people. For anyone else, it would be impossible to complete the first step of the Heavenly Ogre Fist during the refinement.</p>

  <p>After the force coursed through his body, Luo Zheng's eyebrows furrowed a bit, as he didn't feel the demonic life energy inside his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wondered why.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, only a small amount of demonic life energy had been produced inside Luo Zheng's body after his refinement of the Heavenly Ogre Fist. Afterward, the demonic life energy engulfed Luo Zheng's Purple Light Fist life energy as though it were a beast. In the end, all the life energy from Luo Zheng's Purple Light Fist had turned into demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he made the first move of the Heavenly Ogre Fist, which was known as Ogres Shaking the World, the demonic life energy inside his body had been completely consumed...</p>

  <p>In general, one's cultivation would be smooth for a period as long as he found the key to the refinement method. Once a level was overcome, it was like a door was opened to the next stage.</p>

  <p>Very few men would retrogress in cultivation like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had been able to produce and utilize the demonic life energy the previous day, but now he had failed...</p>

  <p>Why? Did he forget a move?</p>

  <p>After thinking it over for a while, Luo Luo Zheng still couldn't figure it out. Since the Heavenly Ogre Fist was a tier five cultivation method, its power would be immense. However, it was so hard to practice this refinement method. It was far more difficult than Luo Luo Zheng had expected.</p>

  <p>How were his practice methods different from what he had done the previous day? Luo Luo Zheng was lost in deep thought.</p>

  <p>He had almost died when he confronted Vale on Hell Mountain. In that critical situation, Luo Luo Zheng knew that he was fighting a losing battle, but he repeatedly tried to use the Heavenly Ogre Fist, still hoping to survive in spite of the slim chance. After several attempts of this refinement method, a little demonic life energy had finally condensed.</p>

  <p>Today, Luo Luo Zheng tried to make use of the Heavenly Ogre Fist on Drizzle Peak, where he was safe.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng thought about this, it dawned on him that Heavenly Ogre Fist might only work when one was on the verge of giving up hope.</p>

  <p>On the previous day, when he was thrown into absolute adversity, Luo Luo Zheng felt himself behaving under an unbelievable state that he could hardly comprehend or describe in words. When faced with such a crisis, he had repeated and thought about each move very slowly.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng was in his room, racking his brain to recall what and how he felt the previous day.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng paced back and forth in his room. He was so lost in thought that it seemed as though he was enchanted. He had been so consumed with his thoughts that Luo Luo Zheng didn't notice that he had spent over half an hour just pacing.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, his eyes gleamed as an idea flashed through his mind.</p>

  <p>Quickly, he jumped to his feet. As his feet touched the floor, Luo Luo Zheng made the first pose for Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>"Maintain forces on the upper and lower body. Repel ogres' intent with heart if any..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lightly swung his arms along a direction. After rotating his arms, all his forces were concentrated near his belly. It was not until this moment that a trace of dark purple demonic life energy appeared between his hands.</p>

  <p>Excitement lit up Luo Zheng's face when he saw the slight trace of demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>On the previous day, he had experienced and witnessed the power of the Heavenly Ogre Fist. He had been able to confront a man at the Illuminating Soul Realm by using one move known as Ogres Shaking the World.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had known that it would be impossible for him to defeat a man who had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm by using the Heavenly Ogre Fist as he was only at the marrow refining level. However, when attacked by Luo Zheng's Heavenly Ogre Fist, Vale had no choice but to counterattack. Vale's reaction had proven the might of a tier five cultivation method.</p>

  <p>Despite his small victory, Luo Luo Zheng had been challenged to condense the demonic life energy. Just now, he had refined the cultivation method for a lap, but only a faint trace of demonic life energy had been condensed.</p>

  <p>If this was going to be the pace, it would take several months for Luo Luo Zheng to fill his belly with demonic life energy...</p>

  <p>After further thought, an idea came to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since demonic life energy could engulf other types of life energy, Luo Luo Zheng thought he might not have to condense it.</p>

  <p>When fighting Vale, Luo Zheng's body had been full of life energy from the Purple Light Fist. But after a trace of demonic life energy had condensed, it absorbed all life energy from the Purple Light Fist. In addition, the demonic life energy engulfed Vale's life vitality by consuming the lotuses.</p>

  <p>Since the demonic life energy was so mystical, Luo Luo Zheng decided to take advantage of the energy.</p>

  <p>At this thought, Luo Luo Zheng brought his knees together and started practicing the mind method of Purple Light Fist that had been passed down to him from the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>Through years of cultivation, Luo Luo Zheng had acquired a good command of the Purple Light Fist. While forces were flowing along Luo Zheng's arms to his entire body, streaks of life energy from the Purple Light Fist sprang up from his belly.</p>

  <p>When this life energy was exuded in large quantities, the faint trace of demonic life energy in Luo Zheng's belly instantly flew toward it, swiftly engulfed it, and then converted it...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just tried cultivating the mind method of Purple Light Fist.</p>

  <p>However, the more Purple Light Fist life energy filled Luo Luo Zheng, the more the demonic life energy he was able to consume. Soon, it began accumulating inside his body. About two hours later, his belly was finally filled with demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng stretched out his arms, demonic life energy spiralled up and out along his arms. To Luo Luo Zheng, it looked like a purple-black demon was fluttering around his hands.</p>

  <p>At this sight, Luo Luo Zheng flicked the demon with his fingers. Immediately, the little purple-black demon jumped out of his palm and into a corner. The demon continued to hop once it had reached the ground.</p>

  <p>"Huh! The life energy can be exuded out of my body!"</p>

  <p>This scene shocked Luo Luo Zheng who although, practicing this refinement method, had never heard of such a thing happening.</p>

  <p>A corporeal form had five levels. Life energy could only exist in vivo or on the surface of the body. The energy should vanish once it left Luo Zheng's body, just like plants couldn't survive without roots.</p>

  <p>Life energy could be only separated from the body of refiners who had been a half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remembered this because he had seen his uncle Bryson pour his life energy into his long sword. Then, he manipulated the life energy inside and killed his enemies with the sword. This was only possible for cultivators who were half-step into the nature level.</p>
