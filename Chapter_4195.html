<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Entering the space channel was risky since nobody knew where it led to.</p>

  <p>Creatures from other races would have known that it was a trap and calmed down almost immediately.</p>

  <p>But the members of the Monkey Spirit Sect were impulsive.</p>

  <p>Manuel, Hagar, and the other Monkey Masters let anger get the best of them. They were determined to tear the Snake Masters into bits along with the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The space channel was small and would only take one a few several steps to get through it. But the Monkey Spirit King had barely entered it when he felt like countless bugs were biting his skin.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was a powerful Treacherous Being. Few things could hurt his body.</p>

  <p>He looked around, confused, but his face darkened as he realized what it was. "It's the Void Dust!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The space channel led to the outside of the main Pure Sky Platform. They realized that they were now in great danger.</p>

  <p>The sickening sizzle of burning flesh sounded through the channel.</p>

  <p>The Void Dust was eroding the Monkey Spirit King, Manuel, Tearrag, and Hagar.</p>

  <p>They were now a hundred miles from the main Pure Sky Platform, making it impossible for them to fly back.</p>

  <p>"Tearrag!" the Monkey Spirit King called out.</p>

  <p>Tearrag understood what the Monkey Spiritual King was trying to say. He was better at space theurgy than the others. So he opened his hands and two blue holes appeared in his palms. These holes that he had created were also space channels, but they were different from other space channels.</p>

  <p>The space channels had been inside Tearrag's body for a long time. They were stable and could be summoned at any time. .</p>

  <p>Tearrag stretched out a hand, causing a blue hole to expand and transform into a huge space channel.</p>

  <p>He then turned around and stretched out his hand once again. The other hole appeared above the main Pure Sky Platform a hundred miles away from them.</p>

  <p>"My king! Let's go inside!" Tearrage said.</p>

  <p>But by then, half of his head had disappeared, having been eroded by the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King endured the sharp pain as he dashed towards the hole alongside the Monkey Masters. But the closer he got to it, the farther backwards the hole moved from him.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King stared at Tearrag and said, "What's this?"</p>

  <p>Tearrag could not speak, for half his head was gone.</p>

  <p>Out of options, he replied through his consciousness, "I lost control over the holes."</p>

  <p>"How can this be?" the Monkey Spirit King said, but he didn't give up.</p>

  <p>He moved forward, but the hole retreated again, as if it was playing a game with him.</p>

  <p>"Cornelius, it is you!" the Monkey Spirit King roared.</p>

  <p>But even his voice could not reach where he wanted it to.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King had filled the space channel with the Void Dust that eroded even sound waves.</p>

  <p>The flesh continued to burn and sizzle.</p>

  <p>The Void Dust devoured Manuel, Tearrag, and Hagar. The Monkey Spirit King was the last to dissipate in the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King, who was in the Heavenly Square City, smiled.</p>

  <p>"Orlando, I can't believe you are still that stupid!" he said.</p>

  <p>When he had taken out the space channel a moment ago, he hadn't expected the Monkey Spirit King to enter it. He had done that just to provoke the Monkey Spirit King. But since the Monkey Spirit King had voluntarily entered it, he thought there was no need to show him any mercy.</p>

  <p>"Did the Monkey Spirit King really fall into the trap?" Sewell asked.</p>

  <p>"He has already been devoured by the Void Dust," the Snake Spirit King replied.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where their coordinates are?" Sewell asked again.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King shook his head. "One thing is for sure. Their coordinates are not in the Jade Pure Realm," he said.</p>

  <p>'The coordinates usually produce energy fluctuations and one should perceive these fluctuations with the help of the Limited Omnipotent Stone.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Spirit King isn't able to detect them, which means that their coordinates are not in the Jade Pure Realm. I guess they are in the Night View Island, ' Sewell pondered.</p>

  <p>"I think their coordinates are in the Night View Island," Sewell said out loud.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King shook his head as he said, "What if they are in the hands of those humans?"</p>

  <p>"The humans..."</p>

  <p>It was bad news that Zheng and his group had suddenly disappeared. What was worse, the Snake Spirit King didn't know how they had vanished into thin air, without any trace.</p>

  <p>If they were capable of avoiding the Limited Omnipotent Stone, then even the Snake Spirit King couldn't locate the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates.</p>

  <p>All the Snake Spirit King's efforts to take out the Monkey Spirit King would be in vain.</p>

  <p>"Keep looking for them," the Snake Spirit King ordered.</p>

  <p>He was filled with regret from within.</p>

  <p>'If I had seen this coming, I would have broken into the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>That would have been better than this, even though it might make it difficult to open the door, ' the Snake Spirit King mused.</p>

  <p>Once Sewell took his leave, the black light reappeared before the Snake Spirit King. "You can't even handle the creatures in the chaos. You are such a disappointment!" the black light berated the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Was there a flaw in my actions?" the Snake Spirit King asked.</p>

  <p>The black light paused and replied, "No."</p>

  <p>"Don't underestimate them! Now that we want to use them, we will need to foresee any future risks," the Snake Spirit King said.</p>

  <p>The Jade Pure Realm was much bigger than the Supreme Pure Realm and the Grand Pure Realm. Its terrain was much more complicated.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng and the others had passed through the Other Shore race, they crossed several stone mountains. And then, a quagmire came into their view.</p>

  <p>This quagmire was five thousand miles wide and was called the Quagmire of Ignorance.</p>

  <p>"We are going that way."</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord led Zheng and his companions to run across the quagmire.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A number of fish with spidery legs emerged from the quagmire. Being unable to perceive the presence of Zheng and his companions, they ran into them.</p>

  <p>Zheng and his companions effectively dodged these creatures, but Fuxi trampled them into a pulp.</p>

  <p>"Fuxi, be careful!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven advised him.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? Are you afraid of alerting the Snake Spirit King?" Fuxi cast an angry stare towards the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"I think it would be better for us to be careful," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>"If we kill too many creatures on the Other Shore, it might alert the Snake Spirit King to our presence."</p>

  <p>Fuxi realized that what the Snake Goddess said made sense. He became more careful and tried to avoid the creatures on their way.</p>

  <p>They had traveled for about two thousand miles above the Quagmire of Ignorance before they were attacked by the winged, poisonous insects.</p>

  <p>The insects seemed to have an extraordinary sensibility because even though the Space Deception Method had caused the group to become invisible, the insects had still detected them.</p>

  <p>The horde of winged poisonous insects were fast, closely following the group. The moment Zhurong noticed that they were getting closer, he used the fire lotus and burned them to ashes.</p>

  <p>Half a day's journey later, they finally crossed the Quagmire of Ignorance.</p>

  <p>They then spotted three towering mountains, an altar standing among them.</p>

  <p>It was just a three-storied altar, but it was only slightly shorter than the mountains that surrounded it.</p>

  <p>"Is that the altar we are looking for?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded in confirmation. His eyes were excited, but also held a hint of sadness.</p>

  <p>'It has been years since I left this place and it's only now that I am finally going to uncover its secret. There is just a soul left in me, but I am still glad, ' the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord thought, thrilled to return.</p>
