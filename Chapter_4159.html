<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tianming was still in a daze, even as he left the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>'Reaching the top was no easy task... As the owner of the tower, shouldn't he congratulate me or assign me some tasks?</p>

  <p>He could have at least revealed the truth of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, or the significance of the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>He didn't even reward me somehow.</p>

  <p>Instead, he just asked me to deliver a message to Holy Mike. Why?'</p>

  <p>Tianming pondered in silent misery.</p>

  <p>By the time he had come to his senses, he found himself under the big bell.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Divine Bell City watched him expectantly.</p>

  <p>Tianming had never disappointed them before. He was outstanding in all he did in the Divine Bell City. This time, he'd reached the top. Everyone's eyes were fixed on him.</p>

  <p>"Tianming, did you succeed?" Bromley, who was standing nearby, asked with concern.</p>

  <p>Tianming glanced at his inner world briefly then nodded. "The sword is already in my inner world."</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Although they had expected this, the crowd still burst into an uproar.</p>

  <p>"Finally, Tianming has reached the top!"</p>

  <p>"Tianming, did you try climbing outside of the tower to see what it's like?"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Everyone bombarded him with questions, barely giving him room to respond.</p>

  <p>Bromley waved his hand, and everyone immediately shut up. "Go to cultivate in seclusion and bear the sword."</p>

  <p>Only after the Other Shore Token was carried in one's inner world and a real link was established could one truly own it.</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded and stood up, eyeing Mike in the group.</p>

  <p>Even though Mike was a Holy Being in the divine land, he still had to line up to ring the bell in the Divine Bell City.</p>

  <p>"Holy Mike," Tianming greeted, bowing courteously.</p>

  <p>Mike bowed back politely. "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Are you going to challenge the ninth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower this time?" Tianming asked warily.</p>

  <p>Mike nodded. "Yes, I want to reach the ninth floor."</p>

  <p>Tianming was a creature born in Mike's inner world, and later on, he was reborn. In a short period of time, he had become a consummate True God, and after entering the Ruin Graveyard, he had even reached the thirty-third floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mike was still at the eighth floor, which was equivalent to the eighth stage of the Other Shore Realm. As a Holy Being of the divine land, he was lagging behind.</p>

  <p>Of course, Mike wasn't an isolated case. The other Holy Beings, except Bromley, were in even worse situations.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Tianming was only able to reach the thirty-third floor thanks to the help of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and Dale. However, Tianming wasn't aware of this; no one was. Everyone was just under the impression that Tianming was extremely talented.</p>

  <p>"When I reached the thirty-third floor, an old man appeared," Tianming said seriously.</p>

  <p>Beside them, Bromley, Holy Jay, and many other humans exchanged strange glances.</p>

  <p>Mike's eyes flashed. "Is he the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?"</p>

  <p>Mike had learned more about the Other Shore from his wife, Lorena. He knew that even in the Source World, it was not easy to become a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm. Among all the members of the Nine Li race, only Chiyou had been to Stage Thirty-three on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In everyone's eyes, the Mysterious Yellow Tower was like a completely independent Other Shore. They could only imagine how powerful its owner must be!</p>

  <p>"He said he was," Tianming answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>The expressions of Mike, Bromley, Holy Jay and the others changed slightly. "What did that old man say?" Bromley asked.</p>

  <p>Bromley was now a member of top management of the Ruin Graveyard, but he knew very little about it. In fact, even the natives of the Ruin Graveyard didn't know much about it.</p>

  <p>"He asked Holy Mike to go to the eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower and bear a butterfly-like Other Shore Token," Tianming replied gravely.</p>

  <p>Hearing this answer, Bromley, Mike and Holy Jay all scratched their heads in confusion.</p>

  <p>"The eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?" Mike frowned. "I remember that among the four hundred Other Shore Tokens on the eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, none of them looks like a butterfly."</p>

  <p>"The old man just put it there," Tianming replied.</p>

  <p>Mike's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>Since it was put there by the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, it must be extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm warriors who had been waiting in line in the Divine Bell City stepped to the side, clearing a path for Mike.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell firmly, then went into the Mysterious Yellow Tower and quickly found the butterfly.</p>

  <p>After bringing the butterfly back to the Divine Bell City, Mike could barely contain his excitement. He couldn't wait to bear it!</p>

  <p>This was a new Other Shore Token!</p>

  <p>However, when he tried activating the butterfly's ability after he bore it, he found that the butterfly was pitifully weak. It only had about ten divine megatons of force, and it had no other special ability.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of this Other Shore Token?" Mike said sulkily.</p>

  <p>The butterfly floated alone in the air above Mike's Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>It was very nimble, but unfortunately, it was indeed quite weak.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay, Bromley and Tianming looked at each other in dismay. The butterfly was so much weaker than the Other Shore Tokens on the eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>"It's strange. Why must Mike bear this Other Shore Token?" Holy Jay pondered aloud, stroking his beard.</p>

  <p>"Since the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower specifically requested it, you have no choice but to bear it now," Bromley said. "He probably has a bigger plan set in motion."</p>

  <p>Mike nodded, deciding to shrug off his disappointment for now.</p>

  <p>Even if he bore this Other Shore Token, it wouldn't hinder his cultivation.</p>

  <p>He could change it when he reached a higher floor in the future.</p>

  <p>After a period of time of acceleration, the Pear Hill's speed was now hundreds of times faster than before.</p>

  <p>Whenever this giant mountain passed through the chaotic clouds, the clouds rippled outward.</p>

  <p>The first destination of the Pear Hill was Zheng's primitive land. Second would be the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>With the help of the first butterfly, Zheng could sense the location of his primitive land. The second butterfly was brought into the Jade Pure Realm by Dale. Its location had always been very strange, so he could only feel it vaguely.</p>

  <p>The moment Mike brought the butterfly back to the Divine Bell City, a clear location showed up in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was still cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes and looked alert.</p>

  <p>"The west," he muttered.</p>

  <p>In the bubble, when he saw that Mike took the butterfly, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>The Lone Sword was the most powerful inheritance in the Mysterious Yellow Tower. That butterfly would lead Zheng straight to the Ruin Graveyard!</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded in satisfaction. He had done what he could.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how the war between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect is going," said Dale.</p>

  <p>Because the bubble's location had been exposed before, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord didn't allow them to observe the war in secret anymore. After all, if they were not careful enough, they could be caught by the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Since the Bird Spirit King hasn't awakened, he definitely is no match for the Snake Spirit King," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord concluded without thinking about it too much.</p>

  <p>"I just hope that the Bird Spirit Sect can hold on..." Arthur said. Rumble!</p>

  <p>Just then, Arthur's huge stomach grumbled loudly.</p>

  <p>"Did you eat something strange?" Dale asked curiously, eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>"You're kidding. I can eat anything," Arthur said with a shrug.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the expression on Arthur's face changed dramatically. His eyes rolled to the back of his head, and only the whites could be seen.</p>

  <p>"But not long ago, he ate something that he shouldn't have eaten," Arthur said in a strange voice. "Do you remember that metal-devouring beast?</p>

  <p>Hahaha..."</p>
