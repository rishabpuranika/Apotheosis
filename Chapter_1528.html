  <p>
</p>

  <p>To Layne, this was the greatest humiliation!</p>

  <p>He had been killed by a human warrior using a simple technique. The anger in his heart continued to swell.</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Luo Zheng could easily defeat Layne was that his strength was high. Layne, with his current cultivation base, was unable to stand tall against his might.</p>

  <p>However, that did not mean that Layne would so easily lose to Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body was strong and he had inborn divine strength, but these two aspects were not worth much in Layne's eyes.</p>

  <p>Layne had more and better abilities. He had made many kills. Moreover, he had comprehended the profound mysteries of the Fire Law. Those were something that only belonged to him. To some extent, it could be said that he had comprehended that Law of Causality all by himself.</p>

  <p>However, he was killed by the human warrior even before he could put his brilliance on display. To put it bluntly, he had been tricked by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>How could Layne accept that?</p>

  <p>He rushed out of the city in a hurry the moment he was revived.</p>

  <p>Right now, what worried Layne the most was that Luo Luo Zheng had hidden himself within the main city.</p>

  <p>He had already made up his mind while waiting to be revived as a soul.</p>

  <p>No matter where Luo Luo Zheng was hiding, Layne would hunt him down!</p>

  <p>Unless Luo Luo Zheng gave up on accumulating Illusion Points, Layne would follow him the entire way.</p>

  <p>When Layne's hawk-like sharp gaze swept around as he stood on the city walls, he was slightly stunned by what he saw.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Luo Luo Zheng floated in the air. It seemed that after Layne was killed, Luo Luo Zheng had not even moved an inch.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng too noticed Layne's stare. The corners of his mouth curled up as he smiled faintly at his opponent.</p>

  <p>When Layne saw Luo Zheng's haughty smile, the flames of fury that had filled his chest poured into his head.</p>

  <p>Without the slightest hesitation, Layne jumped up from the city wall. At the same time, the pair of purple flaming wings on his back soared. The wings extended over a distance of a thousand feet as they charged toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Usually, Layne was a very vigilant warrior.</p>

  <p>In the Ogre Flame World, the competition was fierce. Layne, as successor of the world lord, did not rely solely on his talent.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning itself, Layne had regarded Luo Luo Zheng as a 'sheep', so to speak. He assumed Luo Luo Zheng to be a timid and run-of-the-mill warrior. But now, Layne had been defeated by the sheep!</p>

  <p>It could be said that Luo Luo Zheng had successfully infuriated Layne, causing him to lose his rationality.</p>

  <p>When warriors went into a fit of rage, their strength would often increase or even exceed their limits.</p>

  <p>Layne's next attack would come like a storm that had been brewing for a long time. It was about to burst forth.</p>

  <p>"Layne is so angry!"</p>

  <p>"This human warrior is very calm. Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He seems ordinary. Could it be that this human has someone influential to rely on? Or does he have a secret weapon? How can he be so calm and relaxed facing Layne?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at Layne indifferently as the latter rushed forward. He still did not move. However, even the most observant warrior failed to notice that a faint white halo had appeared beneath the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had calculated the time and begun to extract his chaotic energy. He converted it into the 'Thunderbolt Annihilation' array and quietly buried it a foot beneath the ground.</p>

  <p>"Let's see how you like to witness the power of the Mighty Hellfire!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning around Layne suddenly changed as he finished speaking. A faint red hexagram appeared between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>As the red hexagram slowly rotated, a great power gathered within it.</p>

  <p>Before Layne could launch his attack, it was obvious to many warriors in the city that something was wrong. The strange sensation came from up in the sky.</p>

  <p>Powerful pressure forced itself down from above.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a mysterious internal momentum began to condense in the air.</p>

  <p>Every warrior present was familiar with it.</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the Illusion Battlefield were at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>They had experienced small Heavenly Tribulations several times and gone through the more difficult ones once or twice.</p>

  <p>"Is a Heavenly Tribulation about to begin?"</p>

  <p>"Can we undergo the Heavenly Tribulation in the Illusory Battlefield?</p>

  <p>No way!"</p>

  <p>"If we can pass tribulations in the Illusion Battlefield, won't it be great?</p>

  <p>There is no risk of death here."</p>

  <p>For Luo Luo Zheng and the other ace talents in the universe, it was not so tough to pass a tribulation. But for many ordinary warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, undergoing a tribulation was a dangerous task. They could meet their deaths at any time during the process.</p>

  <p>As soon as they saw the impending Thunder Tribulation, their first assumption was that someone was about to go through a tribulation.</p>

  <p>The strange phenomenon that had appeared in the sky not only attracted the attention of the warriors on the city walls, but also of the others in the main city.</p>

  <p>The warriors were curious as to how someone could pass a tribulation here.</p>

  <p>As for Layne, he had already started gathering his strength in his fury.</p>

  <p>He planned to launch the most vicious attacks over and over again to kill Luo Luo Zheng. If Luo Luo Zheng dared to leave the main city, Layne would kill him first and steal all his Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Layne too noticed the strange phenomenon in the sky, even though he was still burning with rage.</p>

  <p>'Someone is undergoing a tribulation?'</p>

  <p>He was stunned for a moment and did not think much of it. Right now, dealing with Luo Luo Zheng was more imperative to him.</p>

  <p>"Fire can undergo a myriad of transformations. Fire, as opposed to water, leads to enlightenment. Hellfire has the power to blaze the sky, to reverse the universe, and to cultivate?"</p>

  <p>The Mighty Hellfire was a profound mystery that Layne had comprehended through the Fire Law. It was unique in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Ordinary flames could be split into two layers, namely outer flames and inner flames.</p>

  <p>However, the flame that rose from between Layne's eyebrows was different. From the outer layer to the inner layer, the flame had six different colors. In other words, it was divided into six layers.</p>

  <p>On close inspection, one would see how beautiful the flame was.</p>

  <p>However, this exquisite flame contained terrible power in it.</p>

  <p>For years, Layne had not been left defeated whenever he used the Mighty Hellfire.</p>

  <p>But before this flame could fully manifest, a loud rumble came from the sky.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A thunderbolt could be seen in the sky.</p>

  <p>Even lightning would not stop Layne from launching his attack. But he did not know that the Heavenly Tribulation was aimed at him. He only had eyes on Luo Luo Zheng. Since he thought that it was not him the tribulation process was for, he completely ignored it.</p>

  <p>Still, there was a price to be paid for ignoring the danger. Just as Layne became fully prepared to burn Luo Luo Zheng to ashes, a force from the Thunder Tribulation poured down from the sky like a white waterfall, enveloping Layne at once.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the warriors could not help but stare in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Tribulation is aimed at Layne?!"</p>

  <p>"Could the Heavenly Tribulation have been pulled down by the human warrior?"</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? I have never heard of such a thing before! Don't you know that the Heavenly Tribulation only happens when a warrior is about to break through his cultivation base? It's the wrath from the heavens!"</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Tribulation was a punishment, because the heavens could not tolerate the warriors becoming more strong and powerful. So how could the heavens follow a human's order and activate the punishment?</p>

  <p>The warriors present had never heard of such a cultivation method before, so they did not think that explanation was reasonable.</p>

  <p>It was a mere coincidence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been waiting on his spot and Layne just happened to come at him while the Heavenly Tribulation was about to descend and interrupt them.</p>

  <p>How big of a coincidence!</p>

  <p>After the Thunder Tribulation disappeared, Layne's figure also gradually faded away. A dot of red light once again flew back into the city. At the same time, dots of yellow light dissolved into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Layne had been killed by Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Luo Zheng had obtained 140, 000 Illusion Points. Now, after killing him once again, Luo Luo Zheng obtained another 70, 000 Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>This meant that Luo Luo Zheng had earned a total of 210, 000 Illusion Points just from Layne.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he will come again. 30, 000 Illusion Points is not a small number," Luo Luo Zheng murmured airily.</p>

  <p>As for the surrounding warriors, they trembled in their hearts as they looked at Luo Zheng's easy smile. Now, they were certain that the Heavenly Tribulation was most likely brought down by him. How did this human do it?</p>
