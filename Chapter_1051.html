<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1051 Conflicted </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>None of this group of super powerful masters would ever meet a rival in the Central Region!</p>

  <p>A master at the Life and Death Realm was equivalent to a war sage on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>So Ning Yudie, who had just entered the Life and Death Realm, was equivalent to a first level war sage.</p>

  <p>But in reality, all the Life and Death Realm masters and war sages had to experience life and death situations. They were the same as the Small Heavenly Tribulations that Xun had mentioned.</p>

  <p>The Small Heavenly Tribulation was not just a life-and-death situation for martial artists, but also an important test for them.</p>

  <p>After the Life and Death Realm, one could advance to the Soul Sea Realm by passing a few Small Heavenly Tribulations. However, the number of the Small Heavenly Tribulations one had to pass was different for each warrior.</p>

  <p>Generally, in order to advance to the Soul Sea Realm, a warrior would have to go through at least five or six Small Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the higher the level of one's talent, the more Small Heavenly Tribulations one would have to go through, and the more powerful one would become after entering the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>Therefore, the number of Small Heavenly Tribulations one had gone through also determined a martial artist's future prospects.</p>

  <p>There were many war sages in the Sea God Continent, and the ones in front of them were the elite group. As per their cultivation levels, they were only a step away from the Soul Sea Realm! Most of them were sixth or seventh level war sages.</p>

  <p>They had already undergone six or even seven life and death crises.</p>

  <p>Any one of these war sages was much stronger than Eddie, who had endured only four life and death crises.</p>

  <p>In other words, even one of them would be able to single-handedly destroy the entire Central Region!</p>

  <p>Today, more than a hundred of them had gathered here and their combined power was terrifying!</p>

  <p>The warriors in the World Commercial Alliance were all shocked when they saw this scene.</p>

  <p>Dillon, Hobbes, and Haber felt their hair stand on end as a chill went down their spines. The last time they faced an attack from the Heavenly Evil Sect, they had the courage to fight back. But now, looking at these super strong warriors, they did not even have the courage to resist!</p>

  <p>The difference in power was too enormous. Any sort of resistance would be futile.</p>

  <p>Despite this, Dillon braced himself and flew forward. Bowing to the many super masters, he said, "I am the leader of the World Commercial Alliance, and I am here to greet you, powerful masters from the divine kingdom!"</p>

  <p>Miguel who was in the lead looked at the fat man in front of him indifferently and asked, "Where is Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Dillon was indeed strong, but only in front of the warriors in the Central Region. For Miguel he was nothing more than a top-level war lord. In the Sea God Continent, a martial artist of his level could only be used in the fight for a seat at the top floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Miguel had silently assessed Dillon's strength in his heart. His strength was less than any top-level war lord. He was probably inferior to Fabian or Jarrod. And it was even less likely for him to be able to contend with the top-level war lords of the Demon Night and ogre race.</p>

  <p>Dillon was hesitant to reveal Luo Zheng's whereabouts to the powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm in front of him. Frankly speaking, as the leader of the World Commercial Alliance, he should hand over Luo Luo Zheng to them right away.</p>

  <p>For the sake of the safety of the World Commercial Alliance, he had to make the right decision.</p>

  <p>He assumed that these people from the divine kingdom wouldn't be interested in the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had made a vital contribution to the World Commercial Alliance. Although Dillon considered himself a businessman, it was still difficult for him to betray Luo Luo Zheng like this.</p>

  <p>But as the leader of the World Commercial Alliance, he should be responsible for the existence of his people and his land and there was no way he would let the organization down!</p>

  <p>"Brother!"</p>

  <p>Hobbes called out to Dillon.</p>

  <p>How could they not understand Dillon's hesitation?</p>

  <p>Hobbes knew that they could not fight these powerful masters even if they wanted to protect Luo Luo Zheng. It would be like striking a stone with an egg!</p>

  <p>Dillon let out a sigh. He thought, 'That's it. Sorry Luo Luo Zheng.' He considered that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't blame it on him, because he was right now in the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Even if he wanted to escape now, it was too late.</p>

  <p>However, before he could speak, a flash of light came shooting out of Oracle City. It was none other than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Many of the elders and the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance turned to see him. He appeared to be rather calm and composed, while they were astonished.</p>

  <p>How could this guy be so calm in such situation? It looked like Luo Luo Zheng wasn't perturbed at the prospect of facing over a hundred powerful masters from the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>Did Luo Luo Zheng really know a way to defeat them?</p>

  <p>The many stewards and martial artists of the World Commercial Alliance were also secretly observing the situation in the sky. It spelled doom for every martial artist. Even a blind man would know that Oracle City was in danger!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flew towards Miguel under the watchful eyes of everyone present. He stopped in front of him and smiled sheepishly. "The last time when we parted at the Heavenly Eagle Prairie, I thought that it would be a long time before we would meet again. I didn't think I would need your help so soon.</p>

  <p>I am deeply ashamed!" he apologized.</p>

  <p>Miguel smiled gently. "Mr. Luo, you are too humble. The environment you have created for our human race on the Sea God Continent will benefit us for generations. We feel obliged to do our little bit in return," he said graciously.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had changed the situation in the Tower of Sin all on his own, which had far-reaching effects and a big influence on Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Given time, the humans would become one of the top clans in the Sea God Continent in the future. How could the Purple Heart Sacred Place not be grateful to Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>It was due to this reason that Miguel had come personally.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled lightly. Red dots of light began to emit from his body and started to intertwine and condense. Soon they turned into a slender body. It was none other than Luo Zheng's sword spirit, Xun.</p>

  <p>The moment Xun appeared, the six powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm and dozens of Life and Death Realm warriors from the Demon Night knelt down in the air. They bowed to her and spoke in unison, "Greetings, my queen!" dozens of masters at the Life and Death Realm warriors and several powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm just bowed down respectfully to?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword spirit? But why?</p>

  <p>Dillon, Hobbes and Haber, as well as many elders and martial artists from the World Commercial Alliance were all stumped. They couldn't figure out what was happening for a while?</p>

  <p>This scene had completely upturned their understanding of the world.?</p>

  <p>What the heck was going on?</p>

  <p>These warriors didn't seem to belong to the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Were these the reinforcements that Luo Luo Zheng had mentioned?</p>

  <p>If they were just reinforcements, why were they being so respectful to Luo Zheng's sword spirit? Why did they have to be so courteous?</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, there was no divine kingdom. Strength was the deciding factor for everything for martial artists. Only those with great strength would be respected and obtain higher ranks.</p>

  <p>Even Eddie, who was considered to be the mightiest of them all, did not have the authority to make people kneel down and worship him.</p>

  <p>After all, everyone here was a warrior, and no one was willing to take orders from anybody else. Eddie was indeed powerful, but he didn't have the stature to enjoy such great reverence.</p>

  <p>The idea of making a group of martial artists at the Virtual Tribulation Realm kneel and worship Eddie was preposterous. He didn't possess the ability to gain such influence on such a group, let alone on other masters of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>To do so, one had to establish a divine kingdom and set up a monarchy, only then would it be possible to make all the warriors in the Central Region submit. However, it would take a long time to consolidate imperial power and make all the warriors in the Central Region acknowledge and respect the monarch.</p>

  <p>Even so, the really powerful masters would not bow to the emperor in such a manner.</p>

  <p>But these powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were kneeling in front of Xun. It was really happening right before everyone's eyes. The devout look on their faces came from their hearts? it was definitely not something one could fake.</p>

  <p>Dillon was speechless at this sight although he really wanted to shout, 'Oh!</p>

  <p>Heavens and earth! Somebody tell me just what happened?!'</p>

  <p>No matter how much they racked their brains, nobody would have ever guessed that the sword spirit inside Luo Luo Zheng was the queen of the Demon Night, the spiritual totem that ruled over the entire Demon Night race. In the Upper World, even the world lords, who were much more powerful than Xun, had to salute her, let alone the masters at the Soul Sea Realm. It was a perfectly normal thing for them to do.</p>

  <p>Xun glanced at some of the powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm and said lightly, "Please rise."</p>

  <p>Only then did the masters of the Demon Night stand up and respectfully retreat to the side.</p>

  <p>Dillon hesitantly floated over to Luo Luo Zheng, and asked in a trembling voice, "Luo Luo Zheng, what ? what's going on?"</p>

  <p>He had heard Miguel addressing Luo Luo Zheng as Mr. Luo. Dillon suddenly wondered if it was appropriate for him to address Luo Luo Zheng by his first name, seeing as he was inferior to the powerful beings present here.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was only twenty years old! Should he be referring to Luo Luo Zheng as "Master Luo"? This was too weird. He wouldn't even treat Eddie with such reverence!</p>

  <p>Dillon was truly conflicted.</p>
