<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On Luo Luo Zheng and Tia's way back, both of them went through the flood dragon's body without a word.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they felt a little embarrassed or they might be angry at each other.</p>

  <p>The two of them finally arrived at the head of the flood dragon. Luo Luo Zheng looked at its tightly-shut mouth. Some runes were engraved on the rows of its huge teeth, which were interlaced with one another. The Blood Fiend Emperor must have made great changes to the dragon's teeth when the huge flood dragon puppet was made.</p>

  <p>However, how could they get out of it since the mouth of the flood dragon was closed?</p>

  <p>Even if they could go outside, most of the floating stones were probably destroyed. Flying was prohibited in the trial, and it was also hard to climb up the abyss wall!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng thought about it, Tia coldly looked at him and took out the crystal key without a word. She pointed it towards the wall beside her and pressed it hard onto the surface. The wall should be the rear part of the dragon's mouth. It had also been rebuilt, and lots of runes were engraved on it.</p>

  <p>Tia pressed the crystal key following the runes.</p>

  <p>When Tia did so, Luo Luo Zheng felt the ground quake under his feet. He then heard the sound of a chain scratching stone outside. The flood dragon rose continuously. Tia actually had the flood dragon puppet under her control!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gawked at Tia in shock. "This flood dragon puppet was the holy beast to protect Blood Fiend Emperor's sect. It's normal to control it with the crystal key," Tia said icily when she saw Luo Zheng's reaction.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon rose to the top as the chain scraped the wall on both sides of the abyss. Luo Luo Zheng felt the dragon's body shake dramatically when it broke through the top gateway. The metallic sounds of chains breaking were heard. It turned out that Tia made the flood dragon puppet escape from its chains by controlling it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a huge flood dragon appeared in the sky above the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Frank, Tianming, and the other disciples had passed the Death Road. They were far ahead of the other disciples. Now, they had entered the fourth part of the trial called the "Thrilling Icy Plain." In addition, they found another hidden trial there and obtained great rewards.</p>

  <p>All of them had gotten a lot especially Tianming. He had even received a top-grade fairy weapon. Even Frank was a little envious of him. It seemed that luck had blessed Tianming more than him.</p>

  <p>Just after they had gotten the hidden rewards and resumed their path forward, they saw the huge flood dragon in the sky.</p>

  <p>Their eyes were a mixture of fright and surprise as they looked at each other.</p>

  <p>Why was there a huge flood dragon? Was it the flood dragon in the abyss? Did it swallow Luo Luo Zheng and that mysterious disciple of the Cloud Hall? But why was it in the sky now?</p>

  <p>They had so many questions in their minds.</p>

  <p>After a while, Frank's lips curved into a cold smile. "Let's go and move on. After the Death Road, the fourth part of the trial has also been different and there will be greater rewards waiting for us!" he said.</p>

  <p>All the cultivators, who were on the Sea of Raging Fire, had started to enter the Life Road. Although many stone columns were broken, they successfully passed the Sea of Raging due to their good plan. The whole ordeal was extremely dangerous but thankfully, no one died. Only one disciple got burned by the lava due to his carelessness.</p>

  <p>Just after the disciples passed the Life Road, they also saw the huge flood dragon in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Oh my! What a huge dragon!" one disciple shouted.</p>

  <p>"Why is there a huge dragon inside the trial? What does the dragon want to do?" another disciple exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The disciples were thrilled as they watched the gigantic flood dragon up in the clouds. Fortunately, the huge creature was flying away from them.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they would be in a great disaster.</p>

  <p>Outside the trial, Fernandez noticed that all the disciples had looked up.</p>

  <p>He adjusted the Picture Slab to watch the sky as well.</p>

  <p>The sight of the huge flood dragon in flight greeted the eyes of the sect leaders and Fernandez through the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>"This is a flood dragon. It is a mature one that has lived up to at least fifty thousand years!" Fernandez exclaimed in shock. He did not expect to see the flood dragon. He could tell its age, but he didn't see that the flood dragon was actually dead and was now only a puppet.</p>

  <p>"A mature dragon that has lived fifty thousand years? Why did it show up in the trial?" a sect leader asked. The other sect leaders were also puzzled as well.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon was quite powerful and they could never defeat it at all, so the disciples in the trial didn't stand a chance. If the flood dragon wanted it, all the disciples could die in a second.</p>

  <p>The sect leaders and Fernandez probably did not know much about the trial. The whole trial was located in the legacies of a sixth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>Thus, there were always some forbidden places and a holy beast to protect the sect.</p>

  <p>If a disciple trespassed in the forbidden place and released the holy beast, all the disciples in the trial would end up dead!</p>

  <p>Moreover, the holy beast could get out of the trial area and attack people outside. Thus, everyone was in danger.</p>

  <p>"It's alright now as the flood dragon seems to have left."</p>

  <p>The sect leaders and Fernandez were greatly relieved when the flood dragon's figure disappeared through the distance.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon changed its direction every now and then under Tia's control. She then took her Picture Slab from her space bracelet. She could see the world outside the dragon body with the Picture Slab. Now they were above the Sea of Raging Fire.</p>

  <p>"What are you looking for?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously. Tia only stared at Luo Luo Zheng with hatred and did not respond.</p>

  <p>She mentally blamed Luo Luo Zheng for her misfortunes as she had never been in such a low place since her birth, until now. However, there was nothing she could do to him!</p>
