<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also taken aback by the old man's words, but it wasn't the divine weapon that incited this astonishment.</p>

  <p>Divine weapons were rare and precious, true. But with Zheng's current level of knowledge, he wasn't too shocked after seeing one. He had, after all, a Black Star pickaxe!</p>

  <p>What shocked him was the old man's words.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Soul Sea Realm could open up a Soul Sea inside their bodies. But those at the Spirit Supreme Realm could in fact, solidify their life vitality and build up a world of their own. For example, Brianna had operated on her inner world for a hundred thousand years. But she had only managed to create a tiny island, and the creatures on this island were still going through a primitive period.</p>

  <p>Warriors at such a high cultivation level didn't have much of a use for space rings. Their inner worlds could replace such small totems.</p>

  <p>This old man had also stored his treasures inside his belly. However, according to his words, there was also a Soul Sea Realm master in the world inside his body, and that was inconceivable.</p>

  <p>The inner world was formed and solidified through life vitality, and the lives inside it were created by borrowing the power of thunder. They bred and evolved very, very slowly.</p>

  <p>After those living beings developed their wisdom to a certain extent, they could then borrow the life vitality from within the inner world they were living in and cultivate on their own.</p>

  <p>However, the space within such inner worlds was limited, and the resources available were very few. After all, such inner worlds were tiny.</p>

  <p>But even after that, somehow, the person inside this old man's inner world was able to cultivate himself to the Soul Sea Realm. Just how large was his inner world? Just how strong was this old man?</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng's face was filled with shock at his words, the old man waved his hand and told him, "Alright, I've already given my gifts to both of you. Now your wedding ceremony is the most important thing, so just leave me alone and get on with your shenanigans. You can talk to me later if you want!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie bowed to the old man respectfully for the precious gift he had given her. Although this divine weapon was 'too simple' in the old man's eyes, it was still a precious item for her, and its value was more than a 'simple thing'. She knew that the old man had given it to her for Zheng's sake only, but that was no reason for her not to accept it with gratitude.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Mu Ning, who was going around in her everyday clothes, suddenly appeared some distance away.</p>

  <p id="top_11">"Mu Ning!"</p>

  <p>"Sister!"</p>

  <p>Xander and Brent shouted at the same time when they saw her.</p>

  <p>In fact, the people of the Xi Family were not overly happy about today's wedding ceremony. They didn't want it to happen. However, it would be impolite for them to not attend, so they had to swallow their resentment and attend when Luo Zheng invited them.</p>

  <p>Before Mu Ning showed up, Xander and Brent had been very worried about her. They were afraid that she would be unhappy the entire day.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded at her brother and her great grandfather in reply. Her eyes fell on Ning Yudie and she immediately felt a pang of sadness coming over her. The reason why she had stayed in the kitchen and decided to look after the culinary affairs was because she didn't want to see this scene. Of course she had already persuaded herself not to be jealous of Ning Yudie, but she wasn't a machine. She could only try to control her emotions, but she could never sweep them away completely.</p>

  <p>Bitterness stirred inside her when she saw what a perfect match Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie were for each other.</p>

  <p>The small Ancestral Dragon had disappeared some moments ago. She was afraid that it would get lost, so she had come out to search for it and had finally arrived here in its pursuit.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon let out a happy roar when it saw Mu Ning and jumped over towards her.</p>

  <p>It had rushed over when it sensed that Luo Zheng was seemingly in danger.</p>

  <p>Now that it had made sure that Luo Zheng was unharmed, it suddenly thought of the delicacies it had yet to taste in the kitchen. It let out several intimate sounds and threw itself into Margaret's arms.</p>

  <p>This small episode of course wasn't going to disturb the progress of the wedding ceremony. Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie began to go on with the rites.</p>

  <p>The old man, who was seated in a corner, suddenly focused his gaze on Mu Ning. He opened his mouth and called out, "Young lady!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Mu Ning looked around curiously, but she didn't know who had called out to her.</p>

  <p>"Young lady, please come over here!" The old man used his life vitality to speak to Mu Ning this time.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning looked around again and finally found out that the person talking to her was a slovenly old man. She frowned and an impatient expression appeared on her face. She didn't want to bother herself with this person. Her cultivation base was still at the Internal Elixir Realm, so she had no idea just how strong the old man was at all. And being in the kitchen the whole time, she didn't even know what had happened just now.</p>

  <p>She had always neglected cultivation practices because she didn't have much of an interest in martial arts. In her eyes, there was no difference between a Life and Death Realm warrior and a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>She held the Ancestral Dragon tightly in her arms and was about to leave. She couldn't stand seeing Luo Zheng and Yudie's display of their affections any longer. She could learn to be magnanimous as time passed, but not now!</p>

  <p>Seeing that Mu Ning was about to leave, the old man couldn't hold himself back anymore. He had read her mind through her expressions, so he snorted and asked, "Young lady, do you feel resentful upon seeing the man you love marry some other woman?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Margaret's expressions changed. She glared at the old man and asked in an unfriendly tone, "What's it got to do with you?"</p>

  <p>The old man chuckled and replied, "I just want to give you a piece of advice. It is true that the bride is carrying the day right now. But in the future, the person who will spend countless years with Luo Zheng will be nobody but you!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, Margaret's face was filled with astonishment. What did he mean by that?</p>

  <p>Although she couldn't figure it out, but these words were enough to make her walk towards the old man with curiosity. The maidservant brought over a chair for her, and she sat down next to the old man.</p>

  <p>Curiosity was revealed on everyone's faces when they saw that, and even Zheng's attention was drawn. Ning Yudie, who had Zheng's hand in her own, emitted a small strand of life vitality from her fingertip when she noticed his gaze. The cold energy was transferred from her fingertip to Zheng's palm. He turned around and met her angry gaze, which made him feel both alarmed and apologetic.</p>

  <p>After all, it was the day of their marriage. Yudie's displeasure was obvious in her face when she saw him staring at some other woman.</p>

  <p>Women!</p>

  <p>"What did you mean just now, sir?" Mu Ning asked curiously. As this old man had mentioned Luo Zheng without any signs of hostility, her tone was much friendlier now. She even revealed a gentle smile on her face.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled and asked instead of replying, "Never mind that. I just want to be sure about something. You have the Purple Power Body, am I right?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded in reply.</p>

  <p>"In fact, if I am not mistaken, you have the Black-purple Power Body, which is the top-grade. Don't you know what that means?" The old man continued to ask.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning shook her head without any signs of expression on her face.</p>

  <p>She wasn't interested in martial arts, and her enthusiasm for cultivation was even less than what she had for her newly-learnt cooking skills.</p>

  <p>She had little aspirations, and all that she wanted was to stay by Zheng's side. Although she knew that she had the Black-purple Power Body, she had no idea just how strong it could be or what use it had.</p>

  <p>To be frank, it wasn't too difficult to understand that. The Purple Power World was a very special one, and there were countless great masters with the same physique staying within it. As long as she took a casual walk in the Purple Power World, it would be very easy for her to find numerous powerful masters who would be more than happy to help her.</p>

  <p>After all, anyone with the Black-purple Power Body had the potential to control the Purple Power World. It was extremely rare to find someone who possessed it in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>The problem was that once Mu Ning had activated her Purple Power Body, she had only borrowed the huge swords from within it and had once pulled Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie into the Purple Power World to save them.</p>

  <p>At other times, she had never used her powers and in fact, had steered clear of the world she belonged to.</p>

  <p>"No wonder the old lady didn't notice you," the old man shook his head and then asked, "Do you want to become a master? How about I find you a teacher?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stared at him with a strange expression on her face. She felt like he was simply talking nonsense. She was willing to sit here and listen to him because he had told her that she could stay with Luo Zheng for countless years in the future, but now he was talking about irrelevant matters like teaching and becoming a master. Why should she become a super master? Why should she find a teacher? Did that have anything to do with Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was becoming impatient again, and she answered perfunctorily,</p>

  <p>"No, thank you. I have no interest in that."</p>

  <p>"What? You have no interest? Don't you understand my words? You could become a powerful cultivator who can look down on everyone else in the entire universe!" What the old man didn't know was that he was now deviating from the main point that he had mentioned just now and thereby, losing Margaret's attention.</p>

  <p>"So what if I become more powerful than everyone else? What fun would that be?" Mu Ning began to doubt that the old man was just making a fool of her. She stood up from her seat and decided to leave with the Ancestral Dragon in her arms.</p>

  <p>Seeing her actions, the old man thought for a moment and finally discovered the crux of the problem. He now understood that this young lady had no interest in martial arts at all. But even so, he was not disappointed because he also found a way to convince her otherwise.</p>
