  <p>
</p>

  <p>The strong hurricane beat against Mount and Maya harshly, but they continued to fly high.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits attempted to pull the two down, but every time she pulled Mya's hair, her hair grew even longer.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was impossible for the mother to exert any more strength, and naturally she couldn't pull the two down.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, Hoo..."</p>

  <p>"Uncle Mount, is that guy dead?" Mya asked curiously in the hurricane.</p>

  <p>"Theoretically, he is dead," Mount answered flatly.</p>

  <p>Mya was a bit confused. "Theoretically? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"When that part of the space was folded, I exiled him," Mount replied.</p>

  <p>Mya pursed her lips and asked again, "It's not difficult to exile someone in the space, and such a method is not fatal, right? Can you kill him?"</p>

  <p>Overall, the space in the Source World was stable--the True Gods who cultivated the Space Godly Way could not tear the space apart, and it was also hard for them to exile their opponents. On the other hand, it was easy for the Other Shore Realm warriors who cultivated the Truth of Void Destruction to do the same thing.</p>

  <p>Such powerful warriors were also not afraid of being banished from the space. As long as they released enough strength, they could easily destroy the space that imprisoned them and get out of it.</p>

  <p>"That's not what I meant," Mount explained patiently. "After I folded the space, it completely disappeared. In fact, that area with the radius of ten feet has been removed entirely from the chaos. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>After a normal space theurgy had torn a part of a space apart, there was still a void left in the space, and the space itself did not disappear.</p>

  <p>Besides, the space had a high ductility. It would not take long for the surrounding space to squeeze into the void, and then the space would be repaired gradually.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the space was just like water, as it flowed without a stop.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Mount directly deleted a piece of space which involved very complicated rules. It was truly difficult for Mya to understand such a matter.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," said Mya with a shrug. As she was still confused, she asked, "He won't come back, right?"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say," Mount responded.</p>

  <p>Once again, Mya was speechless in confusion. Of course, she knew how powerful Mount was.</p>

  <p>He could kill any opponent in one attack.</p>

  <p>The moment Mount chose to launch an attack in the array, Mya knew that Zheng was doomed.</p>

  <p>Although it looked like that was the case, Mount still said that he wasn't so sure of it. Thus, his words made Mya feel a little puzzled.</p>

  <p>"He is not an ordinary person," said Mount.</p>

  <p>'Of course I know that, ' Mya thought to herself. Generally, Mount didn't need to attack those ordinary people in person because it was easy to deal with them, who were like Khalid.</p>

  <p>"He used the Falling Star Palm," Mount continued to explain. "It's a theurgy of the truth level. Although it's very weak, it's genuine. Zheng is the inheritor recognized by Gerald."</p>

  <p>"Who is Gerald?" Mya blinked. "A Chaos Ancient God," Mount replied.</p>

  <p>Mya's eyebrows shot up in surprise upon hearing those words.</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to kill such a person," Mount stated.</p>

  <p>He was positively confident in his abilities.</p>

  <p>In theory, Zheng had already disappeared, but he still refused to tell the others that he had died.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace looked very anxious.</p>

  <p>"What happened to Zheng? I can't even sense his soul mark!" Feng Ge said with a frown. "Perhaps they exiled Zheng through the space theurgy," Dorothy guessed.</p>

  <p>Dorothy didn't expect that Mount possessed such a unique and remarkable ability.</p>

  <p>Even though she was also worried, she was much calmer than Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"No, that's not a common way to exile someone!" Chaim said and firmly shook his head. It was forbidden to use any space theurgy in the Chaotic Source World. Thus, anyone who was able to break this restriction must be truly powerful.</p>

  <p>Since Chaim was not very experienced, he naturally didn't know anything about the space folding. Still, he could make his own guess.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sally had an ominous premonition that she couldn't stop thinking about. "Then, does that mean that Zheng is..." she trailed off with tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sally, don't worry. Let's wait and see. Zheng is very extraordinary. He will clearly have a way to return," Hutton consoled her.</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race looked up to Zheng as their only hope.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they didn't want him to be in danger or worse, die.</p>

  <p>It was true that Hutton was not as well-informed as the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace, but he was certain that Zheng would definitely come back!</p>

  <p>In the other array, Yan stood under the light barrier, her dark brown eyes filled with complex emotions. Worry, sadness, and anger mixed together, filling her mind and heart.</p>

  <p>"Yan... Your brother will be fine," Natalie comforted her.</p>

  <p>Yan had always been a very optimistic girl in the Pear Hill. It was the first time Natalie had seen her look this miserable.</p>

  <p>"I hope..." Yan whispered. The exploration of the Chaotic Source World had been carried out in accordance with the plan.</p>

  <p>In Yan's eyes, the only possible accident that could happen was involved with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she had been on her guard against him.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for others to notice the Evil God's presence, but Yan could always vaguely feel his position.</p>

  <p>Despite her precautions, the unexpected thing had happened. The strapping young man of the Divine Farmer race had always been low-key, but after he took action, Zheng had disappeared. It was hard for Yan to accept the fact for the time being...</p>

  <p>What made Yan even more worried was the terrible destructive power of the folded space.</p>

  <p>During the process of folding space, that young man even cut off half the hand of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits! Was that an ordinary space theurgy?</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Five minutes had passed.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the hurricane of the Chaotic Source World slowly stopped.</p>

  <p>Thick hair that measured hundreds of thousands of feet long, emitted a faint glow and curled around the mother.</p>

  <p>Mya and Mount slowly descended from the dim sky.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all of warriors in the core area rushed out of the arrays at once.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was the last treasure for them to fight for.</p>

  <p>If they were in single combat, no one in the core area could defeat the mother, and it would be harder to consume the amber-colored crystals in her body.</p>

  <p>Yet, that could change if they attacked her together.</p>

  <p>Some of them could grab a hold of the mother and restrict her flexibility, some could hinder her speed, and some could weaken her strength. Those numerous methods when combined together made the mother not so terrifying anymore.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Khalid took out his long spear as well and charged straight towards the mother.</p>

  <p>Although Mount had made Zheng disappear, there were still many competitors for him. The Ear Mouse race, the Separate Abyss race, and the other super forces were formidable opponents as well.</p>

  <p>The worst thing was the fact that the hurricane had swept away all the members of the Bearing race. It would take them a long time to come back from tens of thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>Just as Khalid was rushing towards the mother, a petite figure blocked his way.</p>

  <p>It was Yan. Her long hair fluttered in the wind and a layer of crimson energy floated around her black locks. Her small face was devoid of any emotion.</p>

  <p>"Hey, little girl..." Khalid mocked. He did not take Yan seriously at all.</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking, however, Yan shouted angrily, "Scram!"</p>

  <p>The word was like a hammer that pounded hard on Khalid's chest.</p>

  <p>The impact sent Khalid flying tens of thousands of feet away, until he fell heavily on the ground and coughed up blood.</p>
