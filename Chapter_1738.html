<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These people were not interested in Luo Zheng's strength, but the potential that he had in this world of chaos.</p>

  <p>After the battle in the Illusion Battlefield, all the major powers would train the ace talents and Godly Geniuses as their families' successors.</p>

  <p>In truth, many of the major powers had already made preparations for the world of chaos before its advent.</p>

  <p>The Sword Manor had selected three core talents for training. Among them, they had selected an ace talent. Unfortunately, the warrior had been eliminated at the second stage itself.</p>

  <p>Any power would definitely be willing to accept an unaffiliated Godly Genius like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, he had suddenly made an appearance at the Sword Manor on his own with the old manor master's seal of Whispering Sword. Strictly speaking, this was a good thing for the Sword Manor!</p>

  <p>But at this point, the master of the Sword Manor was Finch!</p>

  <p>Currently, he was in charge of the Sword Manor; and while he was a righteous and benevolent person, people were selfish.</p>

  <p>He had managed the Sword Manor for so many years, and had always been extremely cautious and very diligent, but now a Spirit Supreme Realm kid had run over and was about to take over the Sword Manor with the old manor master's imprint. It was a difficult decision for anyone to take in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>The group of elders from the Sword House waited silently in anticipation for Finch's judgment.</p>

  <p>An uncomfortable silence and a palpable tension hung in the air at the Sword Heart Pavilion.</p>

  <p>Finch understood the concerns of these subordinates ?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his expression changed and a completely relaxed look appeared on his face. After mulling over it for a moment, he said, "I took over the position of the manor master only to fill in the vacancy and act as an agent for the old manor master to keep the manor functioning normally. According to the old manor master's command, the person with the seal of Whispering Sword was to become the manor master.</p>

  <p>Now that that person has appeared, I should follow the old manor master's orders and hand over the reins to him. However..."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment before continuing solemnly, "Luo Luo Zheng doesn't seem to know the significance of the Whispering Sword seal. He only came here to hone his sword skills. Will he agree to our request? Or rather, the old manor master's request?"</p>

  <p>Obtaining Supreme Lord Sword's Whispering Sword seal meant getting responsibility of the enormous Sword Manor. This was an extremely prestigious matter. Any independent warrior would have been thrilled.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was no ordinary warrior. He was the champion of the Illusion Battlefield as well as an independent warrior. Many sects would most likely do everything in their power to recruit him.</p>

  <p>The people from the Sword Manor didn't know much about Luo Zheng's experience. They assumed that he already belonged to some sect.</p>

  <p>"Humph, the lad has received Supreme Lord Sword's seal, so he has to agree even if he doesn't want to!" said an elder sternly.</p>

  <p>"You're right! Since he has brought the Whispering Sword seal with him, he will be the one to open that door. Does he really think he got Supreme Lord Word's seal just like that? He has a responsibility."</p>

  <p>"Speaking of which, just because he possesses the Whispering Sword seal doesn't mean that he will automatically pass the inheritance trial unscathed."</p>

  <p>The Whispering Sword was just a key. Whether Luo Luo Zheng would be able to pass the trial after opening that door was another matter entirely.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Sword Manor knew that Supreme Lord Sword had been able to rise to prominence because of the Killing Sword Mountain. The origin of this mountain was a big secret even for Finch, and they had all entered the mountain to cultivate. Until now, they did not know why the Killing Sword Mountain held such an appeal to the swordsmen of the world who came from afar carrying their swords and entered the mountain to cultivate.</p>

  <p>When Finch finished, there was a hubbub among the martial artists of the Sword Heart Pavilion again. They wished that they could seize Luo Luo Zheng right away and ask him for an explanation.</p>

  <p>Many people in the Sword Manor would probably have a sleepless night.</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of an uninvited guest who would decide the future of the Sword Manor was a big deal and worth fretting over.</p>

  <p>Yet Luo Luo Zheng was almost clueless about this entire ordeal.</p>

  <p>The next day, when Luo Luo Zheng appeared, it wasn't just Finch and the other two who he had to face, but all of the elders of the Sword House who had convened to interrogate him.</p>

  <p>All eyes were on Luo Luo Zheng. They were all sizing him up. Luo Luo Zheng was the strongest of the younger generation in the universe, and his skills from the painting were still fresh in their minds.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng struck out with the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike, relying on the Instant Godly Tile, he had made an almost perfect sword strike leaving everyone in the Sword Manor awestruck.</p>

  <p>They couldn't believe that a mere Soul Sea Realm warrior could do that.</p>

  <p>Apart from the power of the sword attack, Luo Zheng's blow was made up of the power of the internal momentum in that instant. It was a perfect strike! It was like a work of art for the practitioners who were obsessed with cultivating the sword! The beaming spectators didn't have the words to describe that incredible scene?</p>

  <p>Standing in the presence of these powerful warriors who were only a half-step away from world lords, Luo Luo Zheng certainly felt the pressure. As for Freya, her scalp was tingling. She had seen many powerful entities with Luo Luo Zheng. When the Supreme Lords had besieged the Immortal Mansion, she could only hide to keep herself safe. So all the pressure was on Luo Luo Zheng, and she did not feel too nervous.</p>

  <p>These people in front of her were considered important figures in the eyes of many forces. Their imposing manner alone was enough to intimidate her.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, after you!"</p>

  <p>Finch offered. He was actually keen on talking to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he would wait until Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Killing Sword Mountain with the Whispering Sword and had passed the trial. Only after Luo Luo Zheng had acquired the inheritance of the old manor master fair and square would they be able to take the next step.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng came out of the Killing Sword Mountain empty-handed, then none of the conflicts would exist and there would be no need for the discussion.</p>

  <p>The group of people exited the huge sword structure and flew towards the north.</p>

  <p>As they continued northwards, the buildings below became more and more scattered. A lush and verdant primeval forest was visible to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As they advanced, a mountain range appeared, and in the middle of the mountain range was a gigantic fissure!</p>

  <p>It looked like it had been created by the strike of a sword.</p>

  <p>This crack stretched on for who knew how many miles, with no end in sight.</p>

  <p>Finch led the way, floating down into the crevice. Luo Luo Zheng and Freya followed close behind, with the elders from the Sword House flying majestically behind them.</p>

  <p>Only a thin line of sky was visible from within the depth of the canyon.</p>

  <p>On both sides of the cliff, there were quite a few caves, which might be the lairs of some ferocious beasts.</p>

  <p>After sensing the Mu Ning of Luo Zheng's group, the fierce beasts lay dormant in their nests, not daring to come out rashly.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, a few reckless and less intelligent beasts showed up. One of them was a kind of brown worm. The elders of the Sword House, who were behind Luo Luo Zheng, unsheathed their long swords.</p>

  <p>Their sword rays sliced the beasts into pieces...</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain was the sacred place of the Sword Manor and ordinary people did not have the right to enter it. Only those warriors who had gained a deep understanding of the way of sword had the chance to leave behind their "sword" in the form of a soul ?</p>

  <p>But how could a soul enter this mountain? Was Killing Sword Mountain a soul as well?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already thought about these questions, but he had no answer.</p>

  <p>During their journey, he had inquired of Finch about these questions, who had pondered for a moment, shaking his head. "I also entered the Killing Sword Mountain in the form of a soul, but I have never entered it in the form of a physical body before ?"</p>

  <p>Everyone present had entered the Killing Sword Mountain before, but they had not truly entered it. This was because there was only one way to open the door, and that was by using the Whispering Sword.</p>

  <p>As they continued onward, the gorge became narrower and narrower. In the end, it was only wide enough for one person to pass through at a time. Everyone else followed suit and flew in a line.</p>

  <p>After advancing a bit more, the canyon suddenly widened again. By now the thread of skylight had completely disappeared. Someone had taken out a Glint Pearl in order to provide some light. They had stepped into a huge cave!</p>

  <p>"Grrr..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a low growl was heard, followed by the sound of chains shaking in the darkness not too far away from the group.</p>

  <p>Following the ray of light, two colossal creatures appeared in front of everyone! The two monsters lay prostrate on the ground. Their huge heads were covered with red spikes. They looked sinister and terrifying.</p>

  <p>At this moment, two monsters had already raised their heads. Their crimson eyes revealed hostility, as they glared at everyone like they were going to attack if anyone from the group took one more step forward.</p>

  <p>Freya's face instantly turned pale, and she couldn't help but cower behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid," Luo Luo Zheng said in a soft voice, assuming that since Finch had brought him here, these two vicious beasts shouldn't pose too much of a threat to them.</p>

  <p>"These are the Baleful Celestial Hounds, the watchdogs of the Killing Sword Mountain," explained Finch. He then took out a red flute from his pocket and began playing it lightly.</p>

  <p>The Baleful Celestial Hounds retreated when they heard the lively sound of the flute, and not far away, a huge door appeared. From the door came a strong malicious Mu Ning, as if a hellhound was sleeping at the door.</p>
