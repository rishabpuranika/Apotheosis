<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The king exuded a bold and dignified Mu Ning. When he saw Luo Luo Zheng charging towards him among a great number of men and horses, the graceful king rose.</p>

  <p>He then roared loudly and all the entire lands and rivers suddenly came together to form a long sword in his hand, which he slammed down towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This strike was hiding the sharpest killing intent within the sword light.</p>

  <p>Instead of being terrified by this, there was a hint of a smile on Luo Zheng's face as he faced this sword strike.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found the unending onslaught from the illusory army difficult to cope but now that all the lands and rivers were contained in the king's sword, he did not fear it at all.</p>

  <p>"Power of dragon scales!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had activated the power of three thousand dragon scales. His sword moved from the bottom to the top as he slashed forward. Two rays of light intersected with each other.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, his top-grade sacred weapon couldn't withstand the pressure and broke.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Only half of the long sword spiraled forward, flying towards Fenton.</p>

  <p>Fenton had originally been staring attentively at Luo Zheng's attack. Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that half of a broken sword would come flying at him. He was unable to dodge in time, and the broken sword directly pierced his chest.</p>

  <p>Even though he was severely injured, he didn't move an inch. He kept his eyes fixated on Luo Luo Zheng. Even if he was dead, in the Illusion Space, it was not a major problem. He only wanted to know if Luo Luo Zheng could withstand this move. If Luo Luo Zheng succeeded, he would lose, but if Luo Luo Zheng couldn't take it, he would win. Therefore, he didn't deal with the broken sword that was stabbed into his body.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng's sword was broken, what was he going to use to take the king's sword?</p>

  <p>The top-grade sacred weapon was no longer suitable for Luo Luo Zheng. A normal sword was only two inches wide, with a sharp blade and an extremely thin body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body could only withstand the power of five thousand to six thousand dragon scales. He had just used the power of three thousand dragon scales, so the sacred weapon naturally wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure. Add to that the heavy pressure from the king's sword, and it snapped just like that.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was unable to obtain a better sword from the Lower World. If he had been able to access the weapon refining workshop in the fairy palace, then the situation would have been very different. However, he had just covered two stages of the True Path. He wouldn't be able to use it currently.</p>

  <p>He didn't have a sword anymore, but he could still use his fists.</p>

  <p>In that instant, Luo Luo Zheng tossed away the other half of his sword and grabbed onto the king's sword with his bare hand.</p>

  <p>He was using his bare hand to shoulder the enormous weight of the sword.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was holding onto the blade of the sword with his hand, immediately causing his blood to burst out. At the same time his other hand had already smashed the king's face.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>His punch contained the power of five thousand dragon scales. When it landed on the king, his body split into pieces, turning into specks of golden light. The sword Mu Ning displayed by Fenton was blown to smithereens by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Except for Luo Luo Zheng and Fenton, no one else could see these illusions. For the others, it appeared as though Luo Luo Zheng was surrounded by Fenton's sword light. Luo Luo Zheng was holding on with the sword in his hand and in the end, his sword broke.</p>

  <p>Then they saw Luo Luo Zheng brandishing his fist and smashing Fenton's sword light into a million pieces.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors in the Dragon Tiger Hall felt that this was inconceivable. They couldn't understand how Luo Luo Zheng had done it at all. It was a miracle.</p>

  <p>"I lost!" Fenton admitted miserably, his face deathly white. The broken sword had already pierced through his heart, but his body was especially powerful as he was a warrior. Even with his heart pierced, he had already survived for a long time. So he'd been waiting here.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook the blood off his hand, and said to Fenton with a triumphant smile, "That's right, you've lost!"</p>

  <p>Fenton forced out a tiny smile and said, "It's too painful to speak like this. Let's talk after we get back to the Dragon Tiger Hall."</p>

  <p>Although he would not die in the Illusion Space, his projection could feel the pain caused by the half-sword. Being stabbed in the chest with a broken sword was not a pleasant feeling.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and Fenton opened their eyes at the same time in the Dragon Tiger Hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood up and looked around. The talents in the Myriad Spiritual Force House were all stumped. They could not see exactly how Luo Luo Zheng had broken through Fenton's sword moves, but he had managed to defeat Fenton using a top-grade sacred weapon alone!</p>

  <p>Fenton was the most powerful warrior in the Myriad Spiritual Force House, and more importantly, his sword was a secondary first-rank divine weapon. One could imagine just how big of a gap there was between him and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Luo Luo Zheng had some kind of a trump card that he hadn't used yet, but they didn't need to know anymore. The strength that he had displayed in this fight was enough to earn him their respect. From this day on, they would all look up to him.</p>

  <p>Fenton moved in front of Luo Luo Zheng and bowed deeply in front of him, saying,</p>

  <p>"In the past, I had some prejudice against those who had ascended from the Lower World. But now, it seems that I was wrong. You're not as weak as I thought!"</p>

  <p>All the other warriors in the Myriad Spiritual Force House could not help but nod their heads in agreement as well.</p>

  <p>Warriors from the Upper World indeed had an inexplicable sense of superiority in front of warriors from the Lower World. Even if some warriors from the Lower World had become Supreme Lords, those from the Upper World wouldn't respect them, because they thought those Supreme Lords had just got lucky.</p>

  <p>They didn't know that all warriors who had reached a certain level of achievement would have to rely on both luck and strength. In fact, the warriors of the Upper World were no exception.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only smiled, but didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>He did not care about the contempt others had for him. As the saying went, the strong were always strong. If he became sensitive about what others thought, how would he have managed to gain a foothold in this cruel world?</p>

  <p>After leaving Dragon Tiger Hall, Luo Luo Zheng returned to his corner and started cultivating with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Talents who were coming in and out of the Myriad Spiritual Force House looked at Luo Luo Zheng with reverence. He indeed had earned the right to look down on the Myriad Spiritual Force House. His arrogance was justified and he had the strength to defend his attitude. Nobody would be stupid enough to gossip about it.</p>

  <p>Still, some warriors of the Myriad Spiritual Force House weren't entirely convinced. Some of the top-ranked talented warriors were unable to witness the battle on that day in the Dragon Tiger Hall for some reason.</p>

  <p>When they came back from the outside world, or came out of their closed-door training, they wanted to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, they were stopped by the people of the Myriad Spiritual Force House. They advised these top-ranked warriors that if they wanted to challenge Luo Luo Zheng, they had to defeat Fenton first. Otherwise, they would be humiliated.</p>

  <p>As for the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, he had been extremely unhappy lately.</p>

  <p>He wanted to talk to Luo Luo Zheng and find a way to turn this situation around. He wanted to see if he could pay the price to keep Luo Luo Zheng at the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng stayed, then the young talents in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place would have an advantage in the competition with the other two tenth grade sacred places in the Spirit Reading World. With Luo Zheng's power, they might even be able to turn their luck around and defeat the Spirit Reading Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The competition among the young martial artists would not decide the structure of a supreme world, but it sure would decide the clashes of the sacred places.</p>

  <p>However, when he thought about the thirteen palaces, he gave up on that idea. The thirteen palaces had claimed Luo Luo Zheng, so they must know him well.</p>

  <p>When he first saw Luo Zheng's sacred sword break in the Illusion Space, he thought he could give him a second-rank, or even a secondary first-rank divine weapon as a gift to win him over, but on second thought, the thirteen palaces could offer him everything that he could offer too.</p>

  <p>Such a powerful young fellow might slip away from him. This filled the Saint Lord's heart with deep regret.</p>

  <p>In the Myriad Spiritual Force House, Luo Luo Zheng was quietly meditating for his cultivation. He could already feel that the sixth small Heavenly Tribulation approaching. He wondered if there was any difference between going through the Heavenly Tribulation in the Upper World and in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Time quietly passed as he was waiting and cultivating. However, the big shot who wanted to meet him had yet to appear.</p>

  <p>One month later, an elder from the Spiritual Force Sacred Place entered the Myriad Spiritual Force House. He informed Luo Luo Zheng that the people from the thirteen palaces had arrived and were currently with the Saint Lord.</p>
