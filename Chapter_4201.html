  <p>
</p>

  <p>The snake spirits were surprised when they found the human spirits escaped, but they weren't too concerned.</p>

  <p>In fact, even if they were busy fighting the Bird Spirit Sect, the Snake Spirit Sect could easily take these human spirits back by dispatching some snake spirits in their direction.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the Limited Omnipotent Stone mapped out the escape route of the human spirits.</p>

  <p>Even though the human spirits of the Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House had appeared again, the members of the Snake Spirit Sect barely gave a damn.</p>

  <p>They knew that the human spirits could not change anything.</p>

  <p>"Leave these human spirits to me," Balfour hissed as he emerged from the Snake Spirit King's other side.</p>

  <p>Balfour had been harboring some bitterness at the fact that Gianni had cheated him. At the time, if Sewell hadn't stopped him, he would've taken his people to find and exterminate these human spirits once and for all.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," Sewell agreed readily.</p>

  <p>From the distance, the Primeval Lord of Heaven stared down the approaching Snake Spirit King, determination surging within him. He suddenly raised his head to look upward. Large birds filled the skies; they were the Bird Masters of the Bird Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Sewell looked behind him. "The Bird Spirit Sect is also here," he reported.</p>

  <p>"They are useless."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King, who had been silently moving forward, finally spoke.</p>

  <p>He had already known that the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect had joined forces. Additionally, he was also aware that the Bird Spirit King was not going to participate in this battle.</p>

  <p>Even if the Bird Spirit King did come, the Snake Spirit King was not afraid. Since the Bird Spirit King hadn't woken up yet, he could only fight by instinct. Moreover, his strength paled in comparison to the Snake Spirit King's, which had been proven quite recently.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the Snake Spirit King continued to approach the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his other hand, throwing out more and more coordinates.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Those coordinates flashed with a burst of golden light, and the monkey spirits emerged from them, one by one.</p>

  <p>Out came Tearrag, Hagar, Nereus, Manuel...</p>

  <p>With every appearance of a monkey spirit, the Snake Masters' expressions darkened. When the Monkey Spirit King finally came out, the Snake Masters' faces turned stormy, and even the Snake Spirit King stopped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>The thought that the Monkey Masters' coordinates were in the hands of these humans had crossed the Snake Spirit King's mind once, but he figured the Monkey Masters wouldn't have taken such a great risk.</p>

  <p>After all, this was equivalent to giving their lives to low-level creatures.</p>

  <p>Why would they make such a stupid decision?</p>

  <p>But then again, the Monkey Spirit King was not known for being smart, tactical or patient. He was known for being audacious.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The resurrected Monkey Spirit King, who was sitting on the side of the altar, burst into hearty laughter.</p>

  <p>He roared with all his strength, and his laughter boomed across the land like tidal waves.</p>

  <p>The snake-shaped Treacherous Beings in the distance stumbled backward, totally blown away by the sound waves.</p>

  <p>Even the three mountains around the altar cracked under the impact of the Monkey Spirit King's roar.</p>

  <p>"I finally caught you, Cornelius," the Monkey Spirit King shouted through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was valiant and the best in battle in the Four Spirits Sect. He had always led the monkeys to rush in front, while the Snake Spirit King liked to play dirty tricks in the background. He never understood why the Snake Spirit King operated this way.</p>

  <p>But at this point, he didn't care about getting answers.</p>

  <p>He only knew that the Snake Spirit King was the enemy, the one who had ruined everything.</p>

  <p>Now, it was time to take revenge.</p>

  <p>Cornelius replied calmly, "Do you think you can defeat me?"</p>

  <p>"Why can't I?" The Monkey Spirit King clenched his fist tightly.</p>

  <p>Cornelius shook his head almost pitifully. "If Kincaid was here, you might've a fighting chance. But now, you fight alone."</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was indeed stronger than Cornelius, but it was not difficult to overpower the Monkey Spirit King if he was alone.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Cornelius had deceived him into entering the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Let's see, shall we?"</p>

  <p>As soon as the Monkey Spirit King finished his words, the necklace of teeth dangling at his chest began to glow.</p>

  <p>In the past, he only had thirteen wolf teeth, but Luo Zheng had helped him repair the remaining nine. This greatly increased his strength.</p>

  <p>Planting his foot on the altar, he launched himself towards the Snake Spirit King at full speed.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>One of the wolf teeth flashed brilliantly.</p>

  <p>It all happened so quickly. The crowd was only able to observe the Monkey Spirit King taking one step forward, then countless shadows appeared in a straight line behind him. The next thing they knew, his huge hand had clamped around Cornelius's neck.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King roared excitedly.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Yanking Cornelius's long body into the air, the Monkey Spirit King turned and somersaulted into one of the mountains.</p>

  <p>The mountain collapsed immediately.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Snake Spirit King's body, which had been smashed against the mountain, also broke into countless triangular fragments, like a silver-glazed rain shower.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, Cornelius was found coiling around another mountain. The golden light in his eyes flickered dangerously. Orlando had become much cleverer in battle; now, he didn't merely rely on brute force.</p>

  <p>So Cornelius had to be careful.</p>

  <p>Just then, a human appeared at the foot of the mountain, where the tail of the Snake Spirit King extended.</p>

  <p>It was Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters, Bird Masters, and human spirits were all very astonished when they saw his small figure suddenly appear.</p>

  <p>How could a lowly human intervene in a battle between the two kings?</p>

  <p>He had definitely overestimated himself. Was he here to court death?</p>

  <p>When the Snake Spirit King, who had been focusing on the Monkey Spirit King, saw Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he was momentarily distracted. Had this human gone mad?</p>

  <p>While the Snake Spirit King was lost in thought, Eastern Emperor Taiyi took the opportunity to stab a golden sword into his tail.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>This golden sword was too long to humans, but to the Snake Spirit King, it was but a small golden needle.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, the golden needle had an unimaginable power. It pierced right through his tail, although the actual damage it inflicted was negligible.</p>

  <p>"You can think that we're insignificant, but we're not stupid. We're as smart as human spirits? "</p>

  <p>Before Eastern Emperor Taiyi could even finish his words, the Snake Spirit King flicked his tail towards him. Even though it was supposedly pinned down, it moved so fast that Eastern Emperor Taiyi just saw a blur.</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, his body instantly turned into a blood mist upon impact.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi might've been dead now, but his golden sword didn't disappear.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King had no time to deal with this needle, as the Monkey Spirit King had suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Move!" the Snake Spirit King said.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to move away like what he had done just now, he suddenly felt something was wrong with his body.</p>

  <p>It felt like he was being grabbed by something.</p>

  <p>He shot a quick glance backward to investigate. What he found stunned him.</p>

  <p>That small golden sword had pinned his tail down!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Just then, Orlando landed some heavy punches on the Snake Spirit King's head.</p>

  <p>With each punch, the mountain that the Snake Spirit King had coiled around collapsed a little. After three or four punches, the mountain had been razed to the ground, and a greater part of the Snake Spirit King's body sank in the ground.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Snake Spirit King was still trying desperately to find a way to avoid Orlando's attacks.</p>

  <p>However, the golden sword was displaying an extremely strange power, firmly nailing him to the spot.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi might've sacrificed his life, but the golden sword he used in his final moments seemed to mock the Snake Spirit King.</p>
