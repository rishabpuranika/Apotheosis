<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2930 The Strongest Thunder Punishment </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Holy Being had supported his clan's Floating Island just in time to prevent it from falling.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the Holy Beings of other clans also supported their respective clans' Floating Islands. The warriors that took action included the Holy Beings of the Bai Clan, the Zhao Clan, the Li Clan, the Qin Clan, and the Mu Clan...</p>

  <p>In fact, the Demi-holy Beings on the Floating Islands also could hold a Floating Island. Nonetheless, all of the Demi-holy Beings were fighting for the title of Holy Being in the Mountain of Holy Beings. Because of such circumstances, the Holy Beings could only do it in person.</p>

  <p>However, not all Floating Islands had the Holy Beings at that moment.</p>

  <p>There were still some that needed some help.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan had already given up on their Floating Island due to the threat from Samuel. The whole Floating Island was already empty with no people.</p>

  <p>With no Holy Being to support it, the Floating Island fell down under the enormous pressure...</p>

  <p>Similarly, the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan did not submit to Samuel. As such, the disciples of the two clans had been taken away from the Floating Islands. Thus, there were no Holy Beings to support the Floating Islands of the two great clans.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the top three Floating Islands had begun to haphazardly fall. It was a spectacle that was surprising yet depressing.</p>

  <p>Amidst the falling process, the Floating Islands of the Sword Clan and the Dongfang Clan almost hit the Floating Island of the Tang Clan. Fortunately, while he was supporting the Tang Clan's Floating Island, Clark released tremendous power and pushed the island a little far away from the two falling islands. Thus, the Tang Clan's Floating Island wasn't hit and was left intact.</p>

  <p>Inevitably, the three Floating Islands fell miserably into the Time Sea. Not a single trace was seen after their descent.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings still floated steadily in the air without any sign of decline. Leyton stood firmly on the ground of the Hall of Holy Beings as if he was stuck to it. It was only through this strong stance that Leyton managed to stop the Hall of Holy Beings from falling.</p>

  <p>He looked at the azure light that gathered majestically above his head. His beautiful eyelids constantly twitched.</p>

  <p>The Ruling Slate was suddenly activated, which indicated that Zheng had finally left the Mountain of Holy Beings alive.</p>

  <p>However, Leyton's face had no indication of delight nor happiness.</p>

  <p>The power of the Ruling Slate represented the power of the divine land.</p>

  <p>When the power of the Ruling Slate was activated by the divine might coins, the results were far beyond Leyton's imagination. Even as a three-star Yellow Emperor Guard, Leyton was still a little afraid of the tremendous power it released.</p>

  <p>Leyton couldn't help but wonder how great it would be if Zheng was killed by the ruling power of the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>If Zheng truly had inherited the original will, he would be able to control the power of the rule without being afraid of it. Such a feat could make him even more dangerous.</p>

  <p>Leyton couldn't imagine the consequences.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Those bolts of azure lightning coiled together like countless dragons. As soon as they had gathered together, they shot towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The pressure upon them suddenly disappeared without a trace. All the disciples felt their chests became relaxed.</p>

  <p>When Leyton saw that the thunder of punishment was going straight to the Mountain of Holy Beings on the north of the Time Sea, a fierce light flashed across his eyes. Since the result would be decided soon, he reached out his hand and gently grabbed the Sea Cracking Skull that had been placed in the center of the Hall of Holy Beings. As a result, a strong smell of blood spread out.</p>

  <p>Both he and the Sea Cracking Skull disappeared from where they were.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, they appeared on the north of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Additionally, Hamish and Lorcan also appeared there at the same time.</p>

  <p>The three Yellow Emperor Guards looked cautiously at each other.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't say anything, they knew that the result would be inevitably determined soon. An intense atmosphere was felt between the three of them.</p>

  <p>All they wanted was the death of Zheng. If he could be killed, everything would finally be over.</p>

  <p>As such, a small sense of expectation lingered in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Zheng hadn't obtained the original will. The three of them were just too worried about that. They even let Samuel spend many divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Additionally, maybe the original will of the divine land had a great restriction. Chiyou had chosen to suppress the original will at the very beginning. With his character, he was not even willing to see the birth of the original will. Even if the original will appeared, it would bring a great restriction. One would not simply be considered the master of the divine land even if they successfully merged with the original will.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings realized that the pressure had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, they followed the thunder of punishment after the Floating Islands had been stabilized. Confused expressions painted their faces as they wondered who the target of the thunder of punishment was.</p>

  <p>After he lost the trump card, Pascal, Samuel could only place his hopes on the Ruling Slate. If he could murder Zheng, that could be a way to make amends for his mistakes. Additionally, he could even retain his position and earn Leyton's trust.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>The thunder of punishment coursed through the air with extreme haste.</p>

  <p>Even though the Time Sea was incredibly vast, a bolt of lightning crossed it in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>However, the thunder of punishment unleashed by the Ruling Slate was very special. With its immense power, it was akin to an electric dragon that zapped anything in its path. With a speed that was neither too fast nor too slow, it traversed the Time Sea within thirty seconds.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately noticed it as soon as the Ruling Slate was activated.</p>

  <p>Accompanied with a serious face and formidable stance, he stood firmly at the foot of the Mountain of Holy Beings. Without any word, he patiently waited for the thunder of punishment to descend.</p>

  <p>The moment the thunder of punishment appeared above the Mountain of Holy Beings, a dreadful pressure immediately fell from the sky. Several Holy Beings were shaken by the immense pressure they suddenly suffered.</p>

  <p>"Why is the thunder punishment of the Ruling Slate descending? Is it here to punish Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"There shouldn't be such a powerful rule on the Ruling Slate! Is that even possible? How the hell did Zheng even manage to activate the Ruling Slate?"</p>

  <p>"Is it the Yellow Emperor Guards who did this?"</p>

  <p>The inexplicable chain of events caused confusion among the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Even Murphy, Clark, and Jeremiah were also bewildered.</p>

  <p>In fact, they could also think of the big amount of divine might coins that the Han Clan took away. Nonetheless, they were not allowed to get close to the Ruling Slate, so they weren't able to find out the new rule written on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for those Holy Beings to even think that Samuel had spent most of the divine might coins in the divine land just to write a rule targeted at Zheng alone!</p>

  <p>"Hooo!"</p>

  <p>The enormous pressure disturbed the airflow and formed hurricane-like winds.</p>

  <p>As his black hair fluttered in the wind, Zheng looked indifferently at Leyton in the distance.</p>

  <p>A strong smell of blood emanated from the huge Sea Cracking Skull beside Leyton. When he entered the Mountain of Holy Beings, Leyton might have broken Estelle's Scepter of Gods' Silence with the use of that thing.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the blood of the divine citizens and True Gods that had been taken away before should have been absorbed by it.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Leyton had such a complex expression, Zheng slightly tilted his head and gently raised his hand. A rather warm smile was seen in Zheng's lips.</p>

  <p>The thunder that circled in the air finally came down. With the sudden surge of power, Zheng simply raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The violent thunder poured down mercilessly onto Zheng's body. With its powerful electricity, it easily tore his flesh bit by bit.</p>

  <p>The azure blue light grew extremely brilliant. Even the Holy Beings and the Other Shore Realm warriors could not see Zheng's figure with their eyes. Any spiritual sense they emitted was immediately torn to pieces before it reached the thunder and lightning.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The thunder continued to echo with an ominous sound. Each strike made the Holy Beings frown.</p>

  <p>The power hidden in the Ruling Slate was simply incredible. Clark, who was observing in the distance, opened his mouth, but in the end, he couldn't utter a word. With a feeling of helplessness, he was overwhelmed by such a miserable sight.</p>

  <p>He wanted to say that he himself couldn't survive the thunder punishment and would immediately die in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Even the Other Shore Realm warriors such as Leyton and Hamish were shocked, not to mention a Holy Being like Clark. However, they also felt a little relieved.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they had supported and cultivated Nicholas before. Eventually, they had successfully controlled the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>If the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had teamed up and spent some divine might coins making a rule against the strong Other Shore Realm warriors, they would probably have been directly killed by the thunder of punishment.</p>
