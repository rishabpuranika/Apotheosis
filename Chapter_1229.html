<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng narrated the dangerous moments, life vitality began to flash across Yudie's slender fingers. A blue, icy chill slithered through Zheng's clothes and hit his chest.</p>

  <p>Normally, this kind of a chill could not hurt Zheng. However, the force of it was too strong, and he could still feel the piercing cold when not using his life vitality to block it. She was as if scolding him for taking such risks.</p>

  <p>The two of them lost track of time as they talked and confided in each other, the world outside forgotten. An hour passed by quietly.</p>

  <p>Some time later, strange sounds of some animal echoed in the sky. "Caw!</p>

  <p>Caw!" A furry figure descended rapidly.</p>

  <p>The little thing was born with the ability to fly. It was able to bypass the restraints of the fifth layer of Space Law and directly jump out of the refracted space.</p>

  <p>However, it had only been short while since it was born. Although flying came to it naturally, it was not something it was skilled at yet. Due to incorrect estimation of the distance and its inexperience in controlling the speed, it whirled down from the sky and smashed to the ground like a meteorite, creating a huge pit.</p>

  <p>Yudie let out a small cry and frowned, vexed that their romantic time was disturbed like this. She looked at the little thing in the pit with annoyance, asking, "What is this?"</p>

  <p>"Caw, Caw!"</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon had originally been placed on the Eight-diagram Wheel. Perhaps because it had been separated from Zheng for too long that it was unhappy and had jumped off the wheel.</p>

  <p>It shook its head with vigor to shake off the dirt on its body, rushing toward Zheng the very next moment.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Zheng was holding Yudie in his arms. The little Ancestral Dragon butted in and forcibly pushed Yudie to the side. It made some noises as if in disapproval of Yudie.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Zheng was both irritated and amused. Although he had come to obtain this small dragon, he had not communicated much with this little dragon on his way back from the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place. He had never expected it to be so jealous…</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon had imprinted on Zheng. It regarded Zheng as its family, so in its mind, it would not allow anyone else to get closer to Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Yudie was somewhat indignant at being intruded upon by this unexpected animal. The Ancestral Dragon's appearance was peculiar indeed. It looked similar to a seahorse, so at first sight she didn't recognize that it was, in fact, a dragon. She reached out to push it to the side coarsely.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Yudie extended her hand, the little dragon grew enraged.</p>

  <p>"Caw, Caw!"</p>

  <p>The little dragon's voice sharpened, a unique power bursting out of its body.</p>

  <p>Yudie took a few steps back under the force of the power. The dragon's hostility made her tremble in shock.</p>

  <p>Not just Yudie, even Margaret, who was standing not so far away, felt the strong aura. The crowd waiting outside the Heavenly Stellar Palace shivered. The aura did not feel like it had come from a human. It was domineering and inhumane.</p>

  <p>Only Dorothea looked on indifferently. Although the Ancestral Dragon was very powerful, it had only just broken out of its shell. Furthermore, she was proficient in soul-related cultivation methods, so the aura had no effect on her.</p>

  <p>As Dorothea observed that Yudie and Margaret looked slightly pale, the flower in her right eye revolved gently. With a wave of her hand, a faint circle of light floated over and enveloped the Ancestral Dragon, trapping the aura it exuded. Margaret and Yudie immediately felt better.</p>

  <p>"The dragon was born not so long ago, but it is still very dangerous. Its wisdom has not been fully awakened and its intelligence is akin to that of a three-year-old child. Don't provoke the creature."</p>

  <p>Zheng scooped up the Ancestral Dragon in his arms and glared at it. He still had not decided how to deal with this little companion. He would ask the cyan dragon what to do about it after he was done his affairs.</p>

  <p>"Dragon? Did you just say that this is a dragon?" Yudie asked, her eyes fixed on the little one. She couldn't believe that the tiny creature was a dragon. It didn't look like one at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, not denying it. The Ancestral Dragon seemed to have understood Yudie's words, for it raised its voice, the hostility in the noise obvious.</p>

  <p>"Be it a dragon or otherwise, it is very cute," Margaret said from the side, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Caw, Caw!"</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon seemed to understand what the people were saying. Perhaps because Margaret had praised it, it suddenly left Zheng's embrace and flew straight into Margaret's arms. The dragon licked Margaret with its soft tongue.</p>

  <p>A strange look was plastered across Zheng's face as he witnessed this. He too had no idea why the little dragon was treating them differently...</p>

  <p>Yudie pouted at the Ancestral Dragon, but her gaze was focused on Dorothea. The woman had easily confined the little dragon's power with a simple gesture. Yudie could tell that her skill was exceptional.</p>

  <p>However, she had no idea what kind of method the woman had employed.</p>

  <p>Yudie tried to glean more but was only surprised. She couldn't see through the woman's cultivation.</p>

  <p>Yudie had already entered the Life and Death Realm. She could even distinguish if a warrior was at the Soul Sea Realm. However, she felt that the life vitality released by Dorothea was much purer and refined than that of a mighty one of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, this is…" Yudie began.</p>

  <p>"This is the woman I mentioned to you." Zheng continued, "She is from the Celestial Position. There are altogether seven of them who have come to the Central Region."</p>

  <p>"Why would they come to the Central Region?'' Yudie asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and smiled. "I may only be able to stay for a short period in the Central Region. I'll be leaving soon."</p>

  <p>Thanks to Dorothea, who had persuaded the several other Celestial Position warriors to go to Central Region with Zheng, he was able to come back and revive Yudie. Otherwise, they would have accompanied Zheng to the Sea God Continent in search of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"You are leaving again?!"</p>

  <p>Margaret and Yudie exclaimed at the same time. They didn't expect that Zheng would leave again so soon after his stay in the Oracle City. He had barely been here for half a day.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "Yes, but I will be back as soon as possible…"</p>

  <p>At this moment, an impatient voice rang out from outside of the Heavenly Stellar Palace. "Zheng! I have given you enough time!"</p>

  <p>It was Woody's rough voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned, his face darkening. He led Yudie and a few others out of the main hall of the Heavenly Stellar Palace At the main entrance of the palace, Dillon and the others were looking fixedly at the Eight-diagram Wheel nearby. The wheel rotated slowly as six people stood on top of it. Beside them, a woman lay on the side. It was Brianna from the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the six people standing or the woman lying down, they were all powerful in their cultivation. The aura they emanated far surpassed that of mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Wry smiles were evident on the faces of Hobbes and the rest. The people that Zheng brought back were more intimidating than the previous ones, but what was troubling was that this time they didn't even seem to be friendly with Zheng himself! Any of these individuals could destroy the Central Region with a simple flick of their hands. It was not a wise decision to offend them.</p>

  <p>They were cold, aloof, and didn't seem to like anyone approaching them.</p>

  <p>Dillon, who had the gift of the gab, could not find any opportunity to speak up. The difference in strength was too great and made him lose the courage to talk.</p>

  <p>Facing Woody's cold face, Zheng's expression was indifferent. "It has only been two hours, why are you in such a hurry?" he asked in a monotone voice.</p>

  <p>"Humph. I have a lot of time, but there is no reason to waste it on you,"</p>

  <p>Woody responded, snorting dismissively.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. His gaze passed by Woody and landed on someone else. He cupped his hands at Max, who was at a little distance. "Max, thank you for bringing me back to the Central Region. However, I have one more thing left to do before we set out. I want to borrow the Eight-diagram Wheel from you."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Woody was even more displeased. "What? You still want to waste more of our time? How about we just stay and live here with you?" he asked mockingly.</p>
