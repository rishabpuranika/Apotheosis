  <p>
</p>

  <p>To err on the side of caution, the elders of the Su Clan decided to find out whether what Luo Zheng said was true or not.</p>

  <p>Nevyn, Irving and Osrid had all gone up the mountains, so if Luo Zheng's words were true, they should know about it.</p>

  <p>Of course, Cailen couldn't tell Luo Zheng that they were dubious. He figured that, once Luo Zheng was invited over, the elders' doubts would be erased.</p>

  <p>"Majority of the losers who enter the Dragon City aren't even qualified to go up the mountain." Nevyn sneered. "And yet, you claimed someone managed to become an elite warrior in the span of only two months?</p>

  <p>Please." He shook his head in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"This is the funniest thing I've heard all year! Right, Osrid?" Irving jeered.</p>

  <p>Turning to his brother, he noticed something strange about him. "What's wrong with you... Osrid?"</p>

  <p>Osrid had also wanted to join in teasing Gant, but now he stood motionless, his mouth wide open. It was as though he had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Osrid, what's up?" Reid asked with a concerned expression.</p>

  <p>Osrid didn't respond. He stood frozen for a few more moments before regaining composure. He suddenly bowed clumsily towards the intimidating figure looming before him. "I'm Osrid Su from the Elite Unit.</p>

  <p>Nice to meet you, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Irving glanced at Osrid confusedly. In his eyes, it seemed like Luo Zheng's cultivation base was about the same as theirs. Why was Osrid, a member of the Elite Unit, so dumbstruck by this person?</p>

  <p>Initially, Nevyn shared the same reaction as Irving. However, at the mention of Luo Zheng's name, he suddenly remembered who this guy truly was.</p>

  <p>Although he was unable to attend the Seven Mountains Meeting, word spread fast. Finally, it dawned on them who Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng bowed back politely. "I've mentioned how Gant will become an elite in a year. I'm willing to bet on this."</p>

  <p>"No, no, no... There's no need to do that," Osrid refused, shaking his hands.</p>

  <p>"We dare not question your judgment, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>In Osrid's eyes, Luo Zheng was as powerful as Feng Ge? maybe even more so.</p>

  <p>Surely, it'd be easy to promote Gant to elite discipleship in the Heart Flow Sect. If he actually made a bet with Luo Zheng, Osrid had no chance of winning.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Su Clan, including Cailen and Ruben, exchanged knowing smiles as they watched the scene unfold before them.</p>

  <p>They had achieved their goal to verify Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng came to sit down, Osrid embellished the story that took place in the Seven Mountains Meeting. He was eloquent. As he talked about the fierce fight between Luo Zheng and Feng Ge, he made exaggerated gestures. Even Eira's and Gant's eyes lit up as they heard the story. People of the Su Clan listened to Osrid with great interest, but Luo Zheng felt a little embarrassed with all the flattering.</p>

  <p>When Osrid finished telling the story, Cailen seized the moment to tell Luo Zheng that the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array was prepared and could be set up the following day.</p>

  <p>That night, Luo Zheng sat cross-legged in the Su Clan's backyard to meditate.</p>

  <p>If he could absorb the two Shade Stones, his strength should reach a higher level.</p>

  <p>However, there were still many things he needed to study, such as the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship, the Flow Swordsmanship, and the Sword Texture Technique. He might need to cultivate in seclusion after returning to the sword sect.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, outside the Su Clan's house, two figures lurked among the trees.</p>

  <p>Grayson and Drystan expertly climbed a towering tree. They had been sent by Marco.</p>

  <p>As members of their intelligence agency, they were experts in the art of stealth.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a palm-sized mirror appeared above Grayson's head. It was the Spying Mirror.</p>

  <p>If they tried using their spiritual sense to spy, they'd be detected in an instant. However, by using an Other Shore Token to spy, they could go on unnoticed.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of his hand, Grayson activated the Spying Mirror.</p>

  <p>Instantly, a picture appeared on it. It showed a pretty girl of the Su Clan, staring at herself in a mirror as she combed her hair. After a few more moments of watching her, Drystan scolded Grayson in a low voice, "Get back to business!"</p>

  <p>With another flick of his wrist, another picture appeared. "Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>Grayson cried in disgust.</p>

  <p>Drystan turned to look over his shadow to see what Grayson was making a fuss about. To his surprise, the Spying Mirror depicted two men hugging each other in the corner of a yard. Slapping Grayson on the head, he snapped, "You know what will happen to us if we delay Young Master Marco's business!"</p>

  <p>With an indignant huff, Grayson scanned the entire house of the Su Clan using the mirror. Finally, he found Luo Zheng? at the center of a yard.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's in the Su Clan," said Grayson with a smile. "How about we kill him now?"</p>

  <p>"If we kill him now, Young Master Marco will kill us!" Drystan shot back.</p>

  <p>"Let's just follow Young Master Marco's orders."</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was an elite warrior from the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the three people of the intelligence agency had crossed the Lust World and surpassed the fourteenth stage.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, both Luo Zheng's and Marco's strengths were insignificant compared to theirs. However, they were still fearful of Marco's paranoid character.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained seating, unaware that he was being spied on. No. 9527, on the other hand, felt eyes on him. "Luo Zheng, someone is spying on you."</p>

  <p>"What, really? How come I didn't notice?" Luo Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>His perception was usually extraordinary, so it was impossible for him to not notice if he was spied on by ordinary people. Even now, he couldn't sense any spying presence. The spies must be incredibly powerful.</p>

  <p>"They are spying on you with an Other Shore Token in the southwest," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly stood up and took a few slow steps, taking care not to raise any alarms. Then, he channeled his power into launching himself towards the southwest.</p>

  <p>From the treetops, Drystan saw Luo Zheng suddenly shooting towards them at lightning speed. "Grayson, this brat is running like crazy!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"He found us!" he continued through gritted teeth. "You idiot! Let's go!"</p>

  <p>His expression darkened.</p>

  <p>Their task was to find out if Luo Zheng was in the Su Clan, and they had fulfilled this mission. However, if they alerted Luo Zheng, causing him to leave, then they'd be in big trouble.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!" Grayson said defensively.</p>

  <p>"My Spying Mirror can do it without anyone's noticing. He must be having some..."</p>

  <p>Drystan clapped his hands around Grayson's head, yanking it to face Luo Zheng's direction. "Open your eyes! He's almost upon us!"</p>

  <p>They could see a figure in the distance, running towards them at an incredible speed, jumping from rooftop to rooftop of the Su Clan buildings.</p>

  <p>Luckily for them, the Su Clan had an extremely large house; if not, Luo Zheng would have already covered the distance and discovered them.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>Without any further hesitation, Drystan and Grayson hurriedly returned to the dark path they had come from.</p>

  <p>Just as they jumped down from the treetops, a ray of blazing sword radiance sliced at the spot they were just at. Momentarily stunned by the sudden bright light, Grayson and Drystan clumsily tried to dodge the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Grayson, disoriented, suddenly twisted his body towards the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, the sword radiance didn't explode. Instead, they heard a muffled sound, as though a sharp blade had cut through a piece of worn leather.</p>

  <p>Hastily, the two decided not to think too hard about it, and disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood on the wall enclosing the Su Clan's compound, with a stern look on his face. His eyes vigilantly searched the trees.</p>

  <p>These two men were much stronger than he had imagined. Why did they want to spy on him?</p>
