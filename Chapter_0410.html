<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In fact, in the depths of his heart, Vale was a bit scared about how fast Zheng was improving. His martial arts skills grew by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>'It only took 6 months for Zheng to have the strength to fight against me. If he had three years to practice, it would be impossible for me to catch up with him!' Vale's mind was racing wildly.</p>

  <p>This time, Vale had to pull all his trump cards, techniques and weapons in order to defeat Zheng calmly and easily, striking a blow to his confidence and crushing him.</p>

  <p>Martial arts depended upon the will to improve. But when a warrior was defeated, his will could be diminished. If the blow was too much to bear, then his will could be shattered. He would be haunted by this, and unable to improve anymore.</p>

  <p>In Vale's view, Zheng's strength played a major role in helping him overcome all the obstacles, and walking to the current stage of All Peaks Competition. However, no matter how powerful Zheng was, his top ability was only at the second grade of nature level. His main advantage was that creepy purple-black life vitality!</p>

  <p>As long as he came up with a solution to deal with that, he'd have Zheng on the ropes.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who only had the power of nature level, was nothing more than a clown. So, he figured he had plenty of time to play with Zheng in the ring.</p>

  <p>"Tricks?" Zheng didn't answer his question but repeated his word.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a faint smile made its way across his face.</p>

  <p>So far, Zheng had many cards that had not been used. However, he didn't plan to use these on Vale. While Vale was indeed powerful, he was not the most powerful. If he were to win the first place at the All Peaks Competition, he should keep calm and exercise restraint.</p>

  <p>He would not, of course, show his cards simply because Vale taunted him. Only the mindless would be irritated by words.</p>

  <p>"What can you do to me, if I don't have any tricks?" Zheng asked defiantly.</p>

  <p>'To be honest, Vale's approach is really good. We had only one fight at Hell Mountain. Yet, he managed to remember what happened there and even come up with that approach to block my life vitality attacks.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the strong people seldom pay attention to the weak.</p>

  <p>At Hell Mountain, I was just half-step into the nature level. To Vale, whose level is Illuminating Soul Realm, I'm not worth mentioning. If I weren't Yan's brother, he wouldn't even look at me.</p>

  <p>Just like an ant, no matter how special it is, human beings don't care if they step on one.</p>

  <p>But strong as Vale is, he was able to figure out my special ability and come up with a way to deal with it. From this aspect, he is extremely meticulous.</p>

  <p>Though he can cope with my demonic life vitality, what can he do to me?' So many thoughts had come to Zheng's mind all at once.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's perfect physical condition comparable to the strength of a medium grade spiritual weapon, Vale could do nothing to him. Though the red lotus fire was quite lethal, and though it could bring real harm to Zheng and even defeat him under the condition of the burning of life vitality, his demonic phantom was not weak, and shouldn't be regarded as a useless decoration!</p>

  <p>As for the super gravity which Vale created by using the "murderous intent of lotus", it could only keep Zheng firmly on the ground but not harm him. From Vale's perspective, Zheng was just a copper pea that he could not chew or shatter.</p>

  <p>"What can I do to you? Hum... You really think you're invincible? I'll show you the difference between your power and mine," Vale said with a slight smile, drawing a sword from his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Vale's sword was special. Its body was only two fingers in width, but 3.6 feet in length. The long, narrow sword was also engraved with many simple and ancient lines, obviously an awesome and ancient sword.</p>

  <p>It was known as the Gentleman Sword, a very popular sword in ancient times. In particular, high ranking officials, emperors and generals all wore such a sword. The key to its beauty was its thinness. Yet, due to the extreme thinness, it could be easily snapped. Gradually, the Gentleman Sword lost its popularity, and now everyone in the Eastern Region only regarded it as a useless decoration, fit more for a wall than a war.</p>

  <p>But not all Gentleman Swords were easily broken, and the elite Gentleman Swords, made from top-of-the-line materials, could be fashioned into spiritual weapons and even fairy weapons!</p>

  <p>The Gentleman Sword in the hand of Vale was such a fairy weapon, handed down from the ancient masters. Generation after generation kept it well. It was far more than just a charming, ancient sword and its shining blade was still extremely sharp!</p>

  <p>When Vale held the sword, his whole vitality changed.</p>

  <p>Standing among the white lotus flowers earlier before, Vale had the aura of a domineering emperor looking down upon his subjects. But now, when he held the antique sword in his hand, it made him look like a resurrected emperor, looking down at the lands he ruled with great ambition and arrogance!</p>

  <p>"Wow, it's an antique fairy weapon! An antique fairy Weapon!" one disciple exclaimed. Recognizing Vale's sword, he was excited.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God, he didn't dig up the grave of an ancient monarch, did he?</p>

  <p>How did he get that antique fairy weapon?" one of the disciples asked in a surprised tone.</p>

  <p>"I feel strong emanation of power! It's just a sword, but I can feel the great power of an ancient monarch. This antique fairy weapon is by no means an ordinary object. In ancient times, the owner of this sword must have been a strong master!" one senior disciple said.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned by the Gentleman Sword wielded by the hand of Vale!</p>
