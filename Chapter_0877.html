<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xun pulled back the silver spear and held it in her hand, rather satisfied with her new weapon. Seeing Zheng's startled expression, she said calmly, "It's a pity that you focus on practicing the sword. Otherwise, I can teach you some spear arts of the Demon Night."</p>

  <p>Although Xun had focused on practicing the sword too before the age of twenty, the sword techniques she had cultivated at that time weren't the best techniques of the Demon Night. Her swordsmanship was no better than the swordsmanship Luo Zheng had mastered. Moreover, it was difficult for a man like Luo Zheng to perform the graceful sword dance.</p>

  <p>However, Xun's spear arts was extraordinary. It was one of the most quintessential and unique techniques of Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked in response. Since he had chosen to practice the sword out of all the weapons, he wouldn't give up so easily.</p>

  <p>It wasn't good for martial artists to be greedy with the hope to master various kinds of weapons at the same time. Moreover, if Luo Zheng started to practice the spear, he would have to temper himself to comprehend the spear intent starting from scratch. That was something he certainly didn't want to do.</p>

  <p>However, when Amber heard what Xun had said, she felt differently.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for any of the three queens of the Demon Night to pass down their secret techniques to others. The other two queens of the Demon Night wouldn't be able to master Xun's unique technique either. But it seemed to Amber that the queen didn't mind teaching an outsider the unique technique of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>It was strange. And together with the broken statue she'd seen in the palace, Amber guessed that something must have happened in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, she couldn't figure out what it was. Amber might be a leader of the seventh-grade sacred place, but even after a Soul Sea Realm warrior like her ascended to the Upper World, she was still nothing in the Demon Night in the Upper World. At most, she could only be considered the leader of a squad.</p>

  <p>As for the battle between the queens, Amber wasn't qualified to get involved, unless she could grow and become a master of the Demon Night in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Amber had already taken the test on the Talent Tablet and managed to get her name listed on the second row. Although such an achievement was extraordinary in the Sea God Continent, it was nothing in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Back when she'd taken the test in the Talent Tablet, five names had ranked above hers. Now, two more names had appeared above hers: Luo Zheng and Yolande. Although Amber wasn't in the Tower of Sin, many of the sacred places had their spies travel between the sacred places and the Tower of Sin to monitor every move in the Tower of Sin and bring back every piece of information.</p>

  <p>So of course, Amber already knew that Luo Zheng had kicked two ogre war sages out of the Tower of Sin in an instant.</p>

  <p>The human kid in front of her was someone to be reckoned with. If Luo Zheng had the ability to kick any living creature out of the Tower of Sin, then he was technically the controller of the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>All the races in the Sea God Continent relied on the Tower of Sin to grow.</p>

  <p>Even Amber couldn't have gotten to where she was today without the help of the Tower of Sin. She had relied on the tower to improve her cultivation level and bring out her talent to the fullest. At the same time, through the Tower of Sin, she had obtained great opportunities in the Dark Nether Cave and reached her current status.</p>

  <p>"I've chosen my weapon. Luo Zheng, you can continue to choose some weapons for yourself," Xun said as she handed the long spear to Luo Zheng and let him store it in his space ring. She was still just Zheng's sword spirit, so she was unable to store anything on her own. She would only summon the spear when it was needed.</p>

  <p>The idea of getting a spear for herself had come today as she understood that Luo Zheng would be facing more and more pressure in the future. With Xun's current strength, she might not be able to display even a thousandth of the strength she'd had in the past, but this spear would be enough to help Luo Zheng turn the tides in a battle at a critical moment. This was all that Xun could do for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng already had a top-grade sacred weapon with him, after hearing what Xun said, he still looked around to check if there was something suitable for him. Looking at the variety of fairy weapons and sacred weapons in the place, Luo Zheng shook his head before asking, "Do you have any top-grade crystals?"</p>

  <p>"Crystals?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's request, Amber frowned in confusion. Crystals were usually used to be embedded on weapons. Was Luo Zheng a weapon refiner? Was he asking for crystals for the purpose of refining weapons?</p>

  <p>But of course, Luo Zheng wasn't a weapon refiner.</p>

  <p>Back in the White Emperor City, he had obtained two crystals which were now embedded in his arms.</p>

  <p>These two crystals had been of great help to Luo Zheng. The original purpose of the Phoenix Crystal was to be embedded within a weapon to reduce the weapon's weight, making the weapon more agile and move faster. After Luo Zheng had embedded the Phoenix Crystal in his arm, it had proven to have the ability to greatly enhance his speed.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng was a nature creature, the Phoenix Crystal had been able to greatly increase his speed. However, it was of little help now as Zheng's speed had already reached a very high level.</p>

  <p>As for the Emerald Crystal, although the energy contained within it could destroy enchanted barriers, the enchanted barriers that Luo Zheng usually encountered these days were the ones that could trap war generals and war lords. A single Emerald Crystal was not powerful enough to destroy those enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>So, Luo Zheng had been looking for an opportunity to replace the crystals embedded in his arms. Since Xun had asked him to choose anything he wanted, he didn't want to let this chance slip by. It wouldn't be a big deal for a prominent seventh-grade sacred place to take out two top-grade crystals.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm talking about the kind of crystals that can be embedded in the blade." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to put crystals in your weapons?" Amber asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Sort of..." Luo Zheng knew that he himself could be considered a weapon, so his answer wasn't completely false.</p>

  <p>Amber nodded to the war sage of the Demon Night beside her. The war sage then walked toward a corner of the treasury.</p>

  <p>Amber would personally go and fetch weapons for Xun as she was the queen of the Demon Night. However, as a powerful master in the Soul Sea Realm, Amber would not serve Luo Zheng herself.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the war sage took out a brocade box from the corner of the treasury. The brocade box was filled with crystals of different colors, shapes, and sizes.</p>

  <p>"Some of these crystals are Fire-condensing Crystals from the depths of an active volcano while some are Purple Cloud Crystals from the deep sea abyss. Their effects are different. How many of them do you need to match your sacred or fairy weapons?"</p>

  <p>Amber assumed that either Luo Zheng was a weapon refiner or that he had a friend who was a weapon refiner. If he was going to use the crystals for weapon refining, he would need at least ten to twenty of them, since the success rate of weapon refining wasn't a hundred percent.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's reply surprised Amber. "Two," he said.</p>

  <p>"Only two?" Amber was becoming more and more curious about what Luo Zheng needed these crystals for. Of course, Luo Zheng wouldn't tell her that he was going to embed these crystals in his own body.</p>

  <p>After the war sage of the Demon Night explained the uses and benefits of each of the crystals to Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng picked two crystals that he thought would work best for him.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng had chosen the Phoenix Crystal because his shortcoming lay in his speed. However, now, with the explosive power of the forceful energy and his comprehension of the Space Law, his speed was no longer something he needed to be concerned over. The two crystals Luo Zheng picked now would also benefit him in some way.</p>

  <p>After selecting those two crystals, Luo Zheng had no other requests. Then, Amber led Luo Zheng and Xun to leave the place.</p>

  <p>Xun's purpose of going to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was to argue with the queen who was in charge of the punishment. However, Luo Zheng hadn't come here in vain. He had obtained a top-grade sacred weapon and replaced the two crystals in his arms.</p>

  <p>Two days later, Luo Zheng left the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place together with Esther and Cheryl. They were headed to the Tower of Sin once again.</p>

  <p>During these two days, Amber had clearly indicated to Luo Zheng that if he wanted to wipe out the ogres from the Tower of Sin, the Demon Night would do everything in their power to help.</p>

  <p>The ogre race was not a friendly race. They were born killers and were very violent, which was the complete opposite of the Demon Night, who loved peace and order. Moreover, whether it was in the Tower of Sin or in the God Sea Continent, the ogres always acted against the Demon Night. It was only after Amber had led the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place to power that the ogres had begun restraining themselves.</p>

  <p>If there was an opportunity to get rid of the ogres, Amber would definitely not let it go. As a powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm and the leader of the Demon Night, Amber would not show mercy to the ogres. This was what the world was like. To be kind to her enemies was to be cruel to herself.</p>

  <p>After passing through the transmission array, Luo Zheng once again returned to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The two gates of the Tower of Sin that had been smashed by the ogre war sages had already been repaired.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng had left, the only warriors who had known about what had happened on the tenth floor had been the warriors who had witnessed it.</p>

  <p>However, in the few days that Luo Zheng had spent in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the news of how Luo Zheng had defeated the ogre war sages had spread through all the floors in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>All the creatures already knew what had happened that day. No one knew who had spread this information or whether it had been spread intentionally.</p>

  <p>However, during this period of time, the ogres in the Tower of Sin had indeed restrained themselves quite a bit.</p>
