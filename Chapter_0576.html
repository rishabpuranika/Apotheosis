  <p>
</p>

  <p>The purple cloud of life vitality finally dissipated. Everyone's gaze traveled from the sky to the ground, and finally stayed on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Unlike the other people present, Tianming and Patrick were not so surprised. They had witnessed Luo Zheng's magic many times before and knew how outstanding Luo Zheng's strength was. Luo Luo Zheng had used the demonic life vitality to swallow Dick's Righteousness Song on the fighting field.</p>

  <p>However, at that time, the scale and impact weren't as big as they were now. Therefore, they didn't expect that Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality could absorb those Dark Devil Phantoms.</p>

  <p>Not many people had seen the unusual strength of Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality, so it was no wonder that they had underestimated him. The leaders of the imperial army such as Yolande and Hugh were the first ones to know it. In addition, Seymour and some other cultivators who had entered the Immortal Mansion before were deeply impressed by Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality. However, those soldiers weren't interested in spreading that news. And those cultivators like Seymour had died in the Immortal Mansion and they even didn't have a chance to share it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, except for Tianming and Patrick, Lewis, Frank, Lois, and that disciple of Cloud hall were quite shocked by what happened. Their hearts hammered loudly in their chests as they couldn't believe their eyes. They had never expected for a nature creature to cause this scene!</p>

  <p>They all lapsed into silence to digest what they just saw. After they had gotten over the initial shock, they started to think about Luo Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>"We do not have a magic weapon to store this extra life vitality. I am afraid that we have to waste it," Lois commented. She knew that there was a magic weapon called the Cup of Life Vitality, which could temporarily store life vitality. However, even when they had one at hand, it wouldn't be of much help since it had a very limited capacity and couldn't store the mass life vitality in front of them. Lois observed the cloud-like life vitality and thought again.</p>

  <p>"In that case, just let it explode," Luo Luo Zheng said lightly with a smile on his face, as if he didn't feel pity about the life vitality being wasted. "Close your eyes!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he stopped talking, the little stars within the demonic life vitality burst one by one. They radiated fierce and dazzling flashes of white light. The speed of the explosion then accelerated, and more than one star exploded at the same time. Such massive life vitality explosions generated bright white light which was shining in the small dark world and made the world as bright as daytime. The white light was so bright that no shadows could be seen.</p>

  <p>Everyone immediately closed their eyes by reflex because of the strong light. The intense light was even brighter than the sun. Even Luo Luo Zheng himself couldn't bear it and shut his eyes as well. The others were shocked again, unlike Luo Luo Zheng who just remained calm. These people couldn't help but marvel at the powerful explosion of life vitality. They were afraid that if this kind of power were all channeled to one cultivator, even the cultivator of the Internal Elixir Realm wouldn't be able to resist. 'How can there be such an abnormal and powerful cultivation method in the world? Is Luo Luo Zheng refining a tier 5 cultivation method? However, Cloud Sect is not a top-level sect. So, how could they obtain a tier 5 cultivation method?' Frank and others thought in their hearts. They had so many questions but decided to keep them in their minds.</p>

  <p>At that moment, only one person did not close his eyes. It was that disciple of Cloud Hall. It seemed that he wasn't affected by the intense light. On the contrary, he even widened his eyes and carefully stared at the starlight in the sky. His face had an unreadable look on it. 'No, the explosion power is not from the demonic life vitality itself. I can sense the power of stars. Has Luo Luo Zheng comprehended the power of stars? How did he get the power of a star and play it to such extent? How did he do it?' he thought. Before he could get any answers, he fell into a deep thought.</p>

  <p>He was right. If Luo Luo Zheng relied only on the demonic life vitality, he wouldn't make such big explosions. He did not burst the demonic life vitality like what the others assumed. Instead, he exploded those stars inside the demonic life vitality. Even though the disciple from Cloud Hall had extensive experience and refinement knowledge, he could never know that Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the Sun Moon Stars Picture in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>No matter what they thought in their minds, the light gradually faded.</p>

  <p>They opened their eyes when they sensed that the light wasn't that harsh anymore. After that, they noticed that some patches of black objects had appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>Those black objects were as soft as cake and were about the size of a human fist. They were scattered everywhere.</p>

  <p>"What are they?" Lewis yelled. He immediately stepped forward and picked one up to examine it. A surprised smile crept up on his lips.</p>

  <p>"These black objects are the same with those in the red treasure boxes in the hidden trial! They can enhance the strength of the soul!" Lewis said with thinly veiled excitement in his voice.</p>

  <p>"What? These can enhance the soul?" Frank cocked one eyebrow and asked in surprise. Even someone as proud as he couldn't ignore these black objects if they could really enhance the soul. However, he still had some doubts because these things had spread everywhere here. 'Are they really so useful as Lewis said?' He wondered.</p>

  <p>Aside from Lewis, Luo Luo Zheng also noticed the appearance of these black objects. And he knew more than Lewis. It seemed that these black objects appeared after he had killed the black phantoms. They were almost the same with those in the red treasure boxes.</p>

  <p>Lewis was very clear about the value of these black objects. They could strengthen the human soul, which was hard to be refined by normal refinement methods or by taking magical pills. Just swallow them and then the people would obtain enormous benefits. It was not hard to imagine how precious they were! However, there was a slight difference between these objects and those in the red treasure boxes. When the black objects in the red treasure boxes appeared, they automatically entered the brain and took effect as if they were living creatures and had their own thoughts. But these black objects now did not automatically do these things.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lewis had gotten a bit impatient to find out the reason, so he tried to swallow one. 'Idiot!' Luo Luo Zheng scolded in his heart. When he was about to stop Lewis, the disciple of Cloud Hall coldly said, "These are the poisonous essences of the Dark Devil Phantoms. If you swallow one directly, it will corrode your organs in one second. Try to taste it if you want to die."</p>

  <p>At that point, the essence of Dark Devil Phantom was already on Lewis' lips. After he heard what the disciple of Cloud Hall had said, he immediately spat it out without hesitation. "Oh, really? How come?" He turned to the disciple of Cloud Hall and asked.</p>
