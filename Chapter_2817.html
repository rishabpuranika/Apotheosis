  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the girl with red eyes, Luo Zheng shrank back almost reflexively.</p>

  <p>The girl, however, had a warm look on her face and inquired, "Are you awake?"</p>

  <p>She had been talking to Luo Zheng for a while now, but he had not been responding at all. She naively thought that he had fallen asleep.</p>

  <p>He was amused by her innocence and he almost laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>But when he thought about how useful she would be to him, his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>In the black water area, Sword Chen had decided to obtain this supreme treasure of belief together with Luo Zheng. He had even helped Luo Zheng arrange the sword array and make use of the force of primitive fear in the black water.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had been unexpectedly brought to the ice palace by the mysterious woman.</p>

  <p>And now, the True Demon Body was so close to him after the chaotic battle.</p>

  <p>Wasn't it the right time to refine the True Demon Body?</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm awake now," replied Luo Zheng playing along.</p>

  <p>Pleased by his answer, the red-eyed girl asked, "Are you my companion now?"</p>

  <p>"Your companion?" Confusion flashed across Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>What he had been thinking about was how to refine the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>Back when he had obtained the jade seal in the Time Sea, there was no need to refine it. He had become its owner by merely touching it.</p>

  <p>In fact, the process of refinement had begun from the moment Luo Zheng had entered the inner world of the jade seal. Everyone who had entered that world had an equal opportunity to obtain the recognition of the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had made it before everyone else and so it became his.</p>

  <p>Similarly, did this red-eyed girl seem to be seeking recognition from him too?</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face when this thought popped in his mind. He immediately said, "I'm not afraid of your flames! Do you think I'm your companion?"</p>

  <p>The red-eyed girl widened her eyes and thought for a while before replying excitedly, "Yes! I think so!"</p>

  <p>"And then?" Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>The girl tilted her head and thought some more. Finally, she said, "I have very few companions so I have to cherish every one of them."</p>

  <p>Her eyes turned a darker shade of red as she spoke.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was staring at the girl curiously. Suddenly, he had a strange feeling in his heart. He felt as though his eyes were intensely attracted to the girl. He was simply unable to look away!</p>

  <p>Then he sensed an innocent soul, which was exactly like the girl's soul!</p>

  <p>As soon as he felt it, realization dawned on him.</p>

  <p>'Oh, now I understand.</p>

  <p>Refining the True Demon Body is not as complicated as we thought!</p>

  <p>We just need to get the girl's approval!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>It was the True Demon Body's instinct to merge with the person it recognized.</p>

  <p>However, after the warriors had entered this void, they had immediately started to fight with each other and all of them had shown a strong hostility towards the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>The girl might have treated the others as food, but her programming was very simple. As long as someone tried to guide and persuade her, it was not that difficult to obtain her approval.</p>

  <p>However, in that complex situation, it was impossible for anyone to get this chance.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until Luo Zheng was surrounded by the red lotuses and eventually had a chance to spend some alone time with the girl with red eyes that he discovered this.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's mind was now connected to the girl's and he could feel two peculiar energies. One was from the girl with red eyes, which was able to activate any kind of energy in this world to the hilt.</p>

  <p>The other energy was from the blue-eyed girl, which was able to bring any kind of energy in the world to a halt.</p>

  <p>When both these peculiar energies surrounded Luo Zheng, he fell into a calm state.</p>

  <p>As both energies fused, he wondered whether he had gained the approval of the blue-eyed girl as well when he obtained that of the red-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>Just then...</p>

  <p>A sharp roar sounded out in the void!</p>

  <p>Far away from Luo Zheng, a battle was taking place and Samuel was fuming with rage. His hands were on his chest.</p>

  <p>Since the time the mysterious woman had joined the fight, he had been at a constant disadvantage.</p>

  <p>He had been nearly invincible with the Spear of Supreme Harmony. Even Nicholas had to back off in the face of that spear.</p>

  <p>However, the woman had also copied his Spear of Supreme Harmony. Add the strength of a dozen cloned Holy Beings and she became quite a formidable opponent. It was hard for Samuel to fight against this woman!</p>

  <p>His carelessness had cost him dearly as he was stabbed in the chest by that woman!</p>

  <p>He crushed a golden pill, which turned into a light golden mist, and was then absorbed by him.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>New flesh began to regrow in the big hole in his chest and his wound started healing rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I would advise you to stop resisting. That way, you can die a less painful death," the woman said coolly as she stared at Samuel.</p>

  <p>Although there had been some unexpected situations along the way, she still believed that everything was under control. The only thing that was depressing her was that Luo Zheng had been killed by this fellow. She couldn't accept it, so she was hell-bent on killing Samuel first.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Samuel was feeling no less dejected than her.</p>

  <p>After he received the Stone Mouse's ability, he could read his enemies' Memory Flames at any time, and that was how he knew what Nicholas and the rest had been thinking.</p>

  <p>But this woman, as well as the replicas she had created, had no Memory Flames at all!</p>

  <p>As he could no longer read his enemies' memories, he was naturally at a disadvantage in the battle.</p>

  <p>"Samuel, you are stewing in your own juice! After I return to the Floating Island, I will definitely wage a war in your universe. I hope your universe will be able to hold on for a few days!" Nicholas warned him.</p>

  <p>He, along with the rest, was content to watch the fight from a distance.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Samuel was losing, he provoked him on purpose.</p>

  <p>If Samuel was defeated in a universal war, it would be the end of him.</p>

  <p>Maybe Samuel could be reincarnated and make another comeback one day, but before that, Nicholas would definitely solve the secret of reincarnation and kill him forever.</p>

  <p>"Humph! If I am killed, do you think you'll have a chance to survive? Don't forget her purpose for coming here." Before Samuel could finish his sentence, a fluctuation in space appeared above him. The woman had already launched her attack again.</p>

  <p>Samuel brandished the Spear of Supreme Harmony and disappeared immediately.</p>

  <p>He had fought over a thousand rounds with that woman before.</p>

  <p>He just kept fleeing into space. So it was never an easy feat to kill him.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel hated to keep running like this.</p>

  <p>If he missed even the slightest detail, he would be gravely injured by this woman. If it continued this way, he would be killed by this woman eventually.</p>

  <p>He racked his brains for a solution to this deadlock.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He used the Grand Teleportation technique once again and reappeared at the center of the void. His eyes followed a thin line in the void and he spotted the blue-eyed girl in an ice flower.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the girl was confused by the numerous space channels he had been creating constantly. She stood blankly in the void without moving.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, a bold idea slowly began to take shape in Samuel's mind.</p>

  <p>Instead of wasting his time with that woman, why not try to refine this girl?</p>

  <p>Samuel didn't know the method of refining, but he had no other choice. He believed that at least this was better than fleeing all the way.</p>

  <p>At this point, he vanished once again before the woman could catch up with him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He reappeared at another spot and pricked the line that connected the two girls using his Spear of Supreme Harmony!</p>
