  <p>
</p>

  <p>Rachelle's attack was as quick as lightning.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't dodge it at all because the internal momentum hidden in that blood awl was extremely sharp.</p>

  <p>When encountering a top-rank True God like Soren, Zheng still had the ability to fight back.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't have the chance to put up even a desperate fight against the fatal attack of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Even before the blood awl made contact with him, his soul was firmly grasped by the powerful killing intent from the blood awl. He felt a thrill of horror run through his body.</p>

  <p>The killing intent in the Murdering Godly Way always had a special effect on the opponent's soul.</p>

  <p>With that, Rachelle could easily kill the Soul-killing Ghosts.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Zheng felt as if he was going to die.</p>

  <p>Although Rachelle was quick, there was someone who was quicker than her.</p>

  <p>Troy barely even blinked, but somehow his hand, which had a metallic luster, shot out faster than Rachelle's blood awl, catching it in his palm.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>The still-spinning blood awl made harsh noises as it clanged against Troy's hand.</p>

  <p>However, Troy's hand was too strong. The blood awl could almost penetrate everything, but it couldn't penetrate his hand at all.</p>

  <p>Soon, the metallic luster on the surface of the hand became more and more intense until it was glowing with a kind of strange and powerful energy.</p>

  <p id="top">A moment later, Troy clenched his fist around the blood awl, covering it completely.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A dull sound came from Troy's hand as the blood awl exploded, releasing a strong energy.</p>

  <p>However, the energy was firmly contained within Troy's fist.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Zheng, who was standing nearby, could feel the power of that energy.</p>

  <p>He knew without a doubt that if this energy had escaped from Troy's hand and touched him, it would have instantly annihilated him.</p>

  <p>'Wow! He is so strong!' Zheng thought in great astonishment.</p>

  <p>On the surface, these consummate True Gods didn't seem to be as intimidating as Holy Beings, but their power was also extremely terrifying. Although warriors had watched these consummate True Gods battle in the Arena of Legends, witnessing them fighting in the real world was a completely different feeling altogether.</p>

  <p>Troy cast a glimpse at Rachelle and said coldly, "I've said that no matter where this guy is from, his fate will be decided by our Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Don't humiliate yourself again."</p>

  <p>Anger was written all over Rachelle's pretty face when she heard what he said, and a fierce light glinted in her eyes. She couldn't help but feel aggrieved.</p>

  <p>After all, she had wanted to kill Zheng because she believed he was Mike's man, and it was the Dongfang Clan which was the chief plotter in dealing with the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>She had never expected to be stopped by Troy, a member of the Dongfang Clan. It was so ironic!</p>

  <p>Although Troy was a man of few words, he wouldn't change his mind no matter what others said.</p>

  <p>He rarely fought others and had never challenged anyone in the Arena of Legends. However, his strength was unfathomable, and no consummate True God could ignore this guy.</p>

  <p>Rachelle didn't want to offend him here, so all she could do was glare at Zheng. Then, in a flash, she returned to the bottom of the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>Seeing the ghastly expression on Rachelle's face, Nelly comforted her in a low voice, "Rachelle, don't be angry. Even if you are right about his identity, he won't be able to leave."</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng escaped the Time Sea Forbidden Land, there were Holy Beings right outside the forbidden land. It would be impossible for Zheng to escape under their eyes.</p>

  <p>With knitted brows, Rachelle replied, "Of course I know that. But for some reason, I feel afraid that if I don't kill this guy now, I won't have a chance in the future." It was based on this intuition that she had acted so recklessly just now.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Troy had been quicker than her.</p>

  <p>After saving Zheng, Troy didn't plan to restrict him. He just glanced at Zheng indifferently and said, "You can move freely in the valley, but don't think about running away. Otherwise, no one can save you."</p>

  <p>Troy and Rachelle were actually on the same side. It wasn't to protect Zheng that he had stopped Rachelle from killing him. In fact, Troy believed Rachelle's words. However, he thought that she didn't have the qualification to kill Zheng so casually. He believed that the decision about whether to kill Zheng or let him live should be determined by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>After saying those few words, Troy walked away.</p>

  <p>There was only one person left standing next to Zheng, and it was none other than Alfredo.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, you are a member of our Han Clan. If this is all really a misunderstanding, we will handle it for you," he said.</p>

  <p>Zheng just gave him a faint smile in response.</p>

  <p>Except for Joy and the three girls, no one in the Han Clan treated him as their family even though he had made a big contribution to the clan.</p>

  <p>Alfredo had just mouthed some sympathetic platitudes. The real reason why he had stepped forward was because he had wanted to show the others that the Han Clan was not an ungrateful clan. If Troy hadn't intervened, Alfredo would have pretended to be deaf.</p>

  <p>After Alfredo walked away, Zheng remained standing in the same spot.</p>

  <p>The few consummate True Gods not far away were dealing with Golden Shell Turtles that were crawling slowly, so they hadn't paid much attention to the conflict between Rachelle and Zheng.</p>

  <p>"At the pace you've been improving, if you had faced these consummate True Gods a little later, they would have been no match for you.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, you let the cat out of the bag too early. Alas..." Master Evil couldn't help but sigh in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>In fact, Master Evil was the one who had suggested Zheng go to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>He had thought that if Zheng joined the Floating Island of some clan, he could train at ease and search for opportunities in various forbidden areas, improving himself step by step. This was indeed a good suggestion.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't expected Zheng to be eye-catching enough to attract Joy's interest.</p>

  <p>And in order to help Joy, Zheng had had to achieve a high ranking in the Arena of Legends, which had attracted even more attention.</p>

  <p>In the end, Rachelle had figured out his identity.</p>

  <p>So many coincidences had led to the current situation.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I stepped into the divine land, I knew that my path was destined to be filled with unpredictable dangers. It would be strange if everything kept going smoothly. I'm just going to take it step by step. I'm not scared at all," Zheng told Master Evil in his mind.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, Mike had arranged everything for him, so Zheng had been able to elude danger every single time.</p>

  <p>However, after he had arrived at the divine land, everything was destined to be different.</p>

  <p>Even though Mike's plans were magical, it was impossible for him to control all the aspects. If Mike could deduce everything in advance, then he would be superior to all the Holy Beings and become the head of all the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Anyway, it was fortunate that Zheng had a mind that was strong enough to face any situation thrown at him. Just now, after he had almost died, his mind had been in a chaos.</p>

  <p>Anyone else who had been in Zheng's situation wouldn't have been able to calm down in such a short period of time. However, Zheng had already managed to calm himself down.</p>

  <p>Once he was feeling okay, Zheng took out his Buddha Emperor Sword and walked toward the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>Since no one was going to restrict his freedom, he wanted to take this opportunity to make himself stronger.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings outside the forbidden area also saw this scene clearly.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Rachelle is getting smarter and smarter! According to Harold's words, there is indeed something fishy about that little guy's origin,"</p>

  <p>Clark said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Harold did mention the Han Clan during his speech after his open battle. And it was at that time that the kid appeared. The chances of him being Mike's man are really very high." Jeremiah also nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>With a calm face, Samuel said, "Mike has always been fond of military tactics. It's possible that he has put a pawn in our Han Clan to carry out his plans, but these are only speculations and can't be completely confirmed. Rachelle crossed the limit by trying to kill someone so casually."</p>

  <p>"Samuel is right," said Nicholas in a calm voice. "When Tianxing leaves the Time Sea Forbidden Land, I'll personally investigate him. Everything will be clear at that time. Rachelle was still too impulsive. Fortunately, Troy was able to stop her."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings grew more and more curious about Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>Among these people, only Joy knew the truth.</p>

  <p>Although she looked calm on the surface, she felt restless in her heart.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected things to develop like this in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. There was no way to turn back now.</p>

  <p>If things went on like this, Zheng would be in grave danger.</p>

  <p>Thinking of something, she sighed softly, and a touch of determination flashed quietly in her soft eyes. She had just made a decision.</p>
