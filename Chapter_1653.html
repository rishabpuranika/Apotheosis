  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although she knew that she was about to be eliminated, Mu Ning didn't feel heart-broken.</p>

  <p>To the other geniuses in the Illusion Battlefield, this was a courageous battle for influence and power.</p>

  <p>If they succeeded, they would get the responsibility of shouldering the fate of the entire universe. At the same time, they would also obtain endless resources and a promising future as the reward for it.</p>

  <p>Right now, they were only one step away from reaching the peak of the entire universe. Anyone who was eliminated here and now would feel like throwing themselves off into a deep abyss.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't apply to Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>For her, all these trials and rewards were trivial matters.</p>

  <p>After all, her goal had never been to compete with the countless powerhouses in the universe.</p>

  <p>She had only left the Purple Power World to search for Luo Luo Zheng. As for the expectations her master had for her... She didn't really care about them.</p>

  <p>She had stood out from the trillions of warriors who were competing here, but her real goal was something that most of them would find hard to understand.</p>

  <p>Despite her little interest in the Illusion Battlefield, she was admittedly full of regret as she was about to be eliminated.</p>

  <p>She knew that the one she was looking for was in a nearby castle right now, but the rules restricted her from going there to see him. What a pity!</p>

  <p>At that moment, a figure suddenly dashed past her, snapping her out of her trance.</p>

  <p>The figure then stopped at her side, defending her statue behind him.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>Several muffled sounds reverberated into the air as the wind blades collided against the man.</p>

  <p>'Who is this guy?</p>

  <p>Why is he blocking the wind blades with his flesh body?' she wondered.</p>

  <p>Even an ace talent would be seriously injured if they tried to block the wind blades merely with physical strength.</p>

  <p>She tilted her head and saw a familiar handsome face, with a soft smile hanging on his lips and captivating confidence flashing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Mu Ning wondered whether she was in a dream.</p>

  <p>Her mind was full of questions, and she was still in danger, but all these things no longer mattered to her now.</p>

  <p>She stopped controlling her seven flying swords and they all fell to the ground with a clanging sound.</p>

  <p>Without the protection of the sword formation, a group of Wind Dragons once again came at her.</p>

  <p>If she didn't block their attacks, her statue would be torn to shreds at any moment, and she would be eliminated.</p>

  <p>But she didn't care about that at all. The man standing at her side had her undivided attention now.</p>

  <p>Taking no heed of anything else, she just threw herself into Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>In these past few years, she had always tried to suppress her desire to pine for him, but her longing for him had never stopped even for a second.</p>

  <p>What was worse, the more she suppressed her feelings for him, the stronger they grew. Recently, they had almost reached a point where she could hardly control them.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that all those pent-up emotions were unleashed all of a sudden. She held him tightly in her arms as she locked eyes with him, her eyes filled with infatuation.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning suddenly jumped into his arms, Luo Luo Zheng took a small step back and gently held her up with a warm smile on his face.</p>

  <p>But he didn't ignore everything else like Mu Ning did.</p>

  <p>As the Wind Dragons rushed toward them, he waved his fingers and drew out strands of chaotic energy, causing his chaotic sea to surge with power.</p>

  <p>Many circles of light started to appear on the ground around them.</p>

  <p>He needed to protect Mu Ning and deal with the Wind Dragons at the same time, and the most effective skill he could use was the Thunderbolt Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Although the Thunderbolt Annihilation would consume a large amount of his energy, it was the most suitable strategy for such situations.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, rays of lightning flashed in the sky and then struck the circles of light.</p>

  <p>Powerful pillars of lightning shot down and instantly killed the Wind Dragons. The wind blades formed from the dragons' life energies were swallowed by the great power of Thunder Law. This wasn't the ordinary power of Thunder Law. Luo Luo Zheng had actually borrowed the power of Thunder Tribulation!</p>

  <p>Even Nathan couldn't help but raise his eyebrows at this breathtaking scene. He looked at Luo Luo Zheng with a hint of indiscernible jealousy in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"So this is that Luo Luo Zheng," he muttered to himself. He had seen Luo Zheng's statue when he'd followed Mu Ning a while ago, and that was how he knew what Luo Luo Zheng looked like. "With his cultivation method, he's able to borrow the power of Thunder Tribulation. Interesting!"</p>

  <p>But then an important question suddenly occurred to him.</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't he be in another castle?</p>

  <p>How did he get here against the rules?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't think too much about Luo Zheng's cultivation method. While it was true that a cultivation method of borrowing the Thunder Tribulation was rare, it was only enough to make him a little curious. As a Godly Genius, he was at the peak of the universe and he had always treated all opponents of the same level like dirt.</p>

  <p>What he was really concerned about was what kind of token Luo Luo Zheng had used to move freely among the castles. And then another question occurred to him: didn't Luo Luo Zheng need to protect his own statue?</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what was going on in Nathan's mind. He was busy soothing Mu Ning while dealing with the Wind Dragons at the same time.</p>

  <p>"I've been looking for you for a long time!" Mu Ning complained like a kid throwing a tantrum as she nestled her face against Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>"So have I." Luo Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Her eyes immediately flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>But her face quickly darkened as she shook her head and said, "I don't believe you!"</p>

  <p>"It's true! Believe me!"</p>

  <p>Around them were many other warriors who were trying their hardest to defend themselves in order to avoid being eliminated. In contrast, this couple exchanging romantic whispers were in a league of their own.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng retreated as he guided Mu Ning and her statue to a quiet corner of the castle. The enemies would come in a single direction, so he wouldn't have to pay a lot of attention to them to protect Mu Ning and her statue.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, on the other hand, had complete disregard for the danger around them. Although her ranking was actually higher than Luo Zheng's and she was already powerful enough to fight the ace talents, she had never regarded herself as a real warrior. In her heart, she was still that little woman who liked to cook for him.</p>

  <p>And since Luo Luo Zheng was at her side, she just took it for granted that it was his duty to do the fighting. As for the power of the rumbling thunder behind her and the danger of the enemies, she didn't even bother to turn around to take a look. She pressed her small nose against his chest like a kitten and enjoyed his familiar smell.</p>

  <p>"Why are you participating in the Illusion Battlefield?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning blinked and replied, "Because I knew I'd find you here!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was amused at her unexpected answer. "I mean, how did you improve your cultivation base so much?"</p>

  <p>Through the memories of the world's will, Luo Luo Zheng had known for a long time that she had left the original great world and entered the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Before he had ascended to the Upper World, he'd already known that Mu Ning had concealed something from him.</p>

  <p>He had tried to find out what it was but she had always kept it secret from him. That was why he had been so shocked when he saw her statue in the castle.</p>

  <p>He knew that she wasn't the least bit interested in martial arts but she had actually survived the first stage of the Illusion Battlefield and, what was more, her ranking was higher than his. He almost felt a sense of defeat at the fact. He just couldn't understand what had happened to her.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning smiled happily at Luo Zheng's question. She was pleased because she knew that it was finally time to tell him the whole truth.</p>

  <p>She had concealed the fact that she had taken Apeiron as her master in the Purple Power World ever since Luo Luo Zheng and Yudie's wedding.</p>

  <p>Back then, she had been extremely disappointed and full of jealousy toward Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, she was completely satisfied. Ning Yudie might still be cultivating in the Lower World, but Mu Ning was here snuggling up to Luo Luo Zheng. It was her victory! It was also the best reward for her hard work in the past six years.</p>

  <p>She slowly explained everything to him in detail, telling him about every effort she had made just to see him again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was moved by everything that he heard from her.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that Mu Ning would have done so much secretly, all because she wanted to stay by his side. He felt ashamed that he had never given her anything in return.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning giggled as if she had read his mind. She looked into his eyes and said, "You don't have to feel guilty at all. Just promise me one thing!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's expression turned utterly serious as she replied, "You owe me a formal wedding."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at her, rendered speechless for a moment. But in the end, he showed no hesitation and nodded his head firmly in reply.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's obsession with this matter was so profound that it had affected every aspect of her life. She had had no dedication to martial arts from the very beginning; all of her efforts had purely been for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She smiled in relief when she finally got his promise.</p>

  <p>She buried her face into his chest like a kitten, her eyes full of happiness.</p>
