<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2597 Going For The Kill </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fight between the two races, namely the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor was predicted to be at its end. Both sides knew that it was already the final showdown for the battle for the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>Back on the ongoing battle, it appeared that David had an absolute advantage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no way to confront David who had activated the Dubhe Secret.</p>

  <p>Every Nine Li warriors present who had been watching the fight had the same thought.</p>

  <p>They saw how Luo Zheng had given all his best to suppress the opposing side.</p>

  <p>If he was really no match for David, they thought that he'd better admit defeat as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>For Elsa, Romeo and some others, they had a deeper impression that Luo Zheng was considered to be more important than the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>Everyone was lost in their own thoughts and feelings about the fight going on, but at this moment, an extremely complex aura suddenly emitted from Luo Zheng's huge body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, all along, had always kept his hidden trump card. The complex aura that was just emitted from his body was the Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>When he first came to this world, he couldn't tell the strength of those Wild Gods. His action all this time, fighting with them several times, was to test the waters.</p>

  <p>Even after entering the Nine Li race and cultivating in the Wild God system, he had never used the Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The fused internal momentum began to rise in Luo Zheng's inner world. After escaping from his inner world, it circulated in his giant body.</p>

  <p>The energy was afterwards attached to Luo Zheng's long sword. Like a brown flame, it slowly rolled, and swirled around the long sword.</p>

  <p>"What kind of energy is this?"</p>

  <p>"What an intimidating aura!" "Just a glance of it will make me feel depressed!"</p>

  <p>"Is this Luo Zheng's trump card?"</p>

  <p>Astonishment filled the people of the Nine Li race as they saw what happened. Perhaps, a flicker of hope lingered for victory.</p>

  <p>It was an unexpected move for Luo Zheng to have such a trump card hidden up his sleeves.</p>

  <p>David also noticed the brown energy lingering on Luo Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>The momentum contained in the energy was so complex and powerful that he had never seen this before.</p>

  <p>Facing a sudden and strange situation, there was no way for him to retreat. He was a proud man who never gave in.</p>

  <p>The more powerful Luo Zheng seemed, the more intense the fighting intent in David's heart became.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish!"</p>

  <p>David madly activated the blood power in his body. The black light grew more brilliant, and the aura he emitted was now even on par with Luo Zheng's!</p>

  <p>Two powerful auras surged up into the sky and reverberated on this wild land...</p>

  <p>The auras had spread for thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>The people in the Flying Sickle City, even the people residing outside were also affected by the auras.</p>

  <p>The expression of the ordinary people turned ghastly pale as their hearts thumped wildly.</p>

  <p>Some of the Wild Gods also felt the pressure!</p>

  <p>Tyler, who was hiding in the void, fixed his focus and eyed Luo Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>"That power! This is the energy of the Divine Dao Great Unity!</p>

  <p>Although there are only a few hundred Divine Dao that are merged in the energy, it's already perfect. They have been merged using the Truth of Cultivation Nature." Tyler was truly surprised at this scene.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the exploration of strength source, soul power, life vitality, and chaotic energy was stuck at a bottleneck.</p>

  <p>The powerful masters who reached the Other Shore Realm focused on the level of energy when exploring strength. Many powerful warriors hoped to unify all kinds of energy they had mastered. Mastering these various kinds of energy would, in turn, reveal the mysteries of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The powerful masters, who were second only to the ancient gods, did figure out different kinds of Ways-blending Energy based on their own ideas.</p>

  <p>They had only merged a part of the energies, but it was far from reaching the level of great unity.</p>

  <p>They had learned a lot from the process of fusing different Divine Dao, and it helped them create their own schools. Each school held a different theory of fusing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Above everything else, the Divine Dao Great Unity shouldn't have appeared in this world. Even more so, it shouldn't have appeared on a little boy.</p>

  <p>Back to the battle, Luo Zheng and David continued their fierce fight.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough, you didn't let me down!"</p>

  <p>David cried out as his face turned red from excitement. He was very eager to face the life-and-death battle against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ahahah..."</p>

  <p>Black light circled around his whole body, it soon spiraled up to gather around his two sharp knives.</p>

  <p>Without any scruple, he activated his blood power to the extreme!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!" "Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>He crossed the two knives in his hands and slashed. It immediately produced a beam of black blade radiance.</p>

  <p>The black blade radiance was shaped like a death cross which spread to a width of tens of thousands of feet, heading straight for Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly facing David's attack. This time, he no longer had the slightest intention to dodge. He brandished the long sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Ways-blending Strike!"</p>

  <p>The sword emitted a light of thirty thousand feet long, and viciously spread out.</p>

  <p>As the brown sword radiance came out, the light in the area stretching out a hundred miles had started to dim.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of kinds of internal momentum were fused together in an extremely complex state and turned into an intensely violent energy. The energy was so overwhelming that it made the people who looked at it felt suffocated.</p>

  <p>"Sizz!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword light instantly collided with the two black blade lights slashed out by David.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, the violent collision of the two powerful energies didn't cause too much noise.</p>

  <p>After the collision, the two beams of black blade radiance quickly disappeared, as if they had been devoured by the sword radiance. David's two rays of black blade radiance were crushed by Luo Zheng's sword radiance like dry weed and soon dissipated into thin air.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance's momentum didn't reduce and it even continued to go straight to David!</p>

  <p>"He wins!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the movements of the sword radiance, Adele raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>A hint of joy appeared on the faces of the warriors of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>They were overjoyed about how things had progressed. In the end, Luo Zheng didn't let them down.</p>

  <p>David had disbelief written all over his face. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but the speed at which the sword radiance moved was extremely fast towards him.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance swiftly charged and in a blink of an eye, came straight at him!</p>

  <p>He even forgot to go into the void to avoid Luo Zheng's sword radiance attack.</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>Tyler, who had been hiding in the void, sighed faintly.</p>

  <p>He had hoped that his disciple could defeat Luo Zheng, but upon catching a sight of the Ways-blending Strike, he knew that David would surely be defeated.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race was determined to take over the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>"It's a foul play, but I have no choice. Don't blame me, boy," Tyler muttered. As this thought flashed through his mind, a strong will instantly appeared in the Soul Ring in David's mind.</p>

  <p>David's movement halted for a quick second as his eyes lost their luster.</p>

  <p>His figure became unusually quick.</p>

  <p>Facing the sword light, he retreated while at the same time waved the two sharp knives in his hands in an unusual quick motion!</p>

  <p>"Cre-ka-rack!"</p>

  <p>Every time the sharp blades clashed with Luo Zheng's sword radiance, they had weakened the sword radiance a bit.</p>

  <p>David continued to slash about seventy times, and every strike landed on the anterior of the sword radiance. This technique of controlling with utmost precision had amazed everyone.</p>

  <p>He retreated several hundred steps after the attack. The sword radiance seemed to be disintegrated by him!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>David, now whose eyes were lifeless, raised the two sharp knives in his hands and stepped forward. He traveled through space and rushed straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Out of a sudden, it looked like he had become a completely different person.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked about the change in David's action. He abruptly rolled to the side out of reflex.</p>

  <p>However, his speed was still a little slow.</p>

  <p>The strike that came out from the void had already slid past Luo Zheng's shoulder, leaving a two thousand feet long trace of blood behind his back!</p>

  <p>David who had succeeded in leaving a hit on Luo Zheng's body was not satisfied. Luo Zheng was still on the process of stabilizing himself, but another sharp knife had come at Luo Zheng's back. He was going for the kill!</p>
