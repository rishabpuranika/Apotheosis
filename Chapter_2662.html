<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2662 Jealousy </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng skimmed through a row of low houses and saw a mountain from a distance.</p>

  <p>He saw that a row of black tombstones stood, lined up along the said mountain.</p>

  <p>After they flew over these tombstones, one singular tombstone stood out as it was tall and placed at the back.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was wondering who was buried under this tombstone, Fuxi threw him down randomly. To his surprise, Zheng fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>One foot close to the ground, Zheng merely tapped his toe and stood steadily beneath the tombstone.</p>

  <p id="top_21">Just then, Fuxi flashed and appeared right beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a long, intent look at the tombstone. There were no inscribed words or carvings on it, so he didn't know who was buried here.</p>

  <p>"Why did you take me here?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>With a calm expression on his face, Fuxi looked like an ordinary person without anything unusual.</p>

  <p>No one would have guessed that he had killed Spark, an Other Shore Realm warrior so easily.</p>

  <p>Fuxi didn't answer Zheng's question and instead, lightly tapped on the tombstone.</p>

  <p>Just as his hand stopped tapping, gold threads slowly spread out at the bottom of the tombstone. These gold threads climbed up and soon spread all over the tombstone.</p>

  <p>Looking at the threads, Zheng couldn't seem to understand them.</p>

  <p>"I have stayed here for a very long time, about 30 billion years," said Fuxi, staring at the fine, majestic lines. "Even for me, 30 billion years is not a short time. I have wasted all my time here."</p>

  <p>"You are not trapped here, aren't you?" Zheng asked, puzzled. "You could have left as you wished. Why didn't you leave?"</p>

  <p>All Zheng knew was that the man in front of him, Fuxi, was very powerful.</p>

  <p>Besides, he was the brother of Snake Goddess. Because of this, he had the notion that no one could imprison him no matter how bad they wanted to.</p>

  <p>This guy chose to stay, and yet he was complaining that he had wasted his time here. Zheng shook his head in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Leave?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes flashed with a golden light, and his hand had already placed on Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Crackle!</p>

  <p>Just then, an intense force began to drop on Zheng's shoulder, which sent his bones shattering.</p>

  <p>Right before the pain began to take over his body, Fuxi's hand flashed bright light and Zheng's broken shoulder was back to normal again.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what will happen if I leave?" Fuxi asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips and said, "No, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you curious?" the man asked again.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, no, I am not," replied Zheng with a shrug.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was rendered speechless at his response. The guts this guy had were unbelievable.</p>

  <p>On Zheng's behalf, he wanted nothing but to cut off the Curse Chain and leave this prison.</p>

  <p>Whether Fuxi wanted to stay or not had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was angry. "It seems that you know nothing about it. It didn't make sense at all. Why would Othniel choose you? Why!?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng rolled his eyes in annoyance. He didn't know that such a question bothered Fuxi for so long.</p>

  <p>But even though Fuxi seemed to care so much, Zheng didn't give a damn about the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>As everyone knew, the truth theurgy was too complicated to be understood, but its power was not so extraordinary. The only time when one could show its use was after the activation of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>But now that Zheng wanted to return to the divine land, it was impossible for the Warden race to use the Strength Equalizing Theurgy in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Considering his current state and everything that had happened, the truth theurgy was nothing to him.</p>

  <p>"For your information, I have no idea why he even chose me in the first place," Zheng sassed. "Can I leave now?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" As he spoke, Fuxi slammed his palm hard against the tombstone, and the gold threads that emerged from it began to tremble crazily.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had just patted Zheng's shoulder casually, and the force that erupted from that slap made his bones turn into pieces.</p>

  <p>But this tombstone seemed to be made from some special material, and it still stood firmly after being slapped by Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"I made a bet with Herbert," Fuxi expressed as he gritted his teeth. "If I can't discover the secret on this tombstone, I will never leave this world.</p>

  <p>I want Herbert to approve of me and finally give me his blood. This is my only hope!"</p>

  <p>Now it all made sense. The main reason why Fuxi had stayed here for the past 30 billion years was to acquire the truth theurgy of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>In Fuxi's opinion, it was impossible to obtain the truth theurgy through mediation. The only way to obtain it was to have the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline.</p>

  <p>Though Herbert gave him hope, Fuxi remained unable to solve the mystery. As for Othniel, he did not pay attention to Fuxi at all.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was such a powerful character. He had pursued the truth theurgy hard but failed. Yet here was Zheng, who gained it so easily.</p>

  <p>How could he not be angry? How could he be not jealous of Zheng?</p>

  <p>"The mystery of this tombstone should come down to the understanding of the Godly Ways Great Unity," Fuxi declared. "Hence, I will take advantage of your Truth Crystal to solve the mystery by backstepping.</p>

  <p>You are not allowed to leave until I do so. Now you can show me the Truth Crystal." He was cold and harsh, unwavering to anything that stood before him and his goal.</p>

  <p>With his talent, only a handful of things could ever faze him.</p>

  <p>The reason why he was unable to discover the mystery hidden in the tombstone was because of the restriction of the Godly Ways Great Unity.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he assumed that using Zheng's Truth Crystal could solve it, especially because the crystal had been obtained by the Chaos Ancient God from the Godly Ways Great Unity.</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly shocked to hear this.</p>

  <p>This guy had been meditating here for 30 billion years, but he had not yet figured out the mystery of the tombstone.</p>

  <p>'If he can't master it, will I have to stay here for countless years, too?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"What if you still can't comprehend it?" Zheng just had to ask.</p>

  <p>"Then I guess you'll be stuck with me for a while," Fuxi sneered.</p>

  <p>'No way!'</p>

  <p>Zheng's face flushed with anxiousness and concern.</p>

  <p>But even though he wanted to retaliate so bad, Zheng had no choice but to obey to the powerful Fuxi.</p>

  <p>However, at the same moment, No. 9527's consciousness suddenly came out from the sclerite in Zheng's chest. "Fuxi, don't waste your time. We will never ever choose you."</p>

  <p>After No. 9527 had sneaked into Zheng's body, it wasn't planning on directly communicating with anyone. However, it chose to talk to Fuxi this time.</p>

  <p>As soon as Fuxi sensed the words coming out of Zheng's mind, his body suddenly trembled. He stared at Zheng's chest and asked, "You are... You are Othniel!"</p>

  <p>"No, I am not," No. 9527 beckoned back. "I am a mere fragment of his soul."</p>

  <p>"A part of his soul?" Fuxi's eyes flickered in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Give up now. I advise you not to make things difficult for Zheng. After all, he was handpicked by our master. Keeping him here would anger the master, and he would surely make you suffer," No. 9527 continued.</p>
