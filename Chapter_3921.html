  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yan floated over slowly and then gazed at the huge body in a vigilant manner.</p>

  <p>To be honest, it was a bit difficult for her to link this huge monster with her brother. It just didn't seem possible.</p>

  <p>However, she had personally witnessed the entire fierce battle herself.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about it. This was undoubtedly Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Brother..."</p>

  <p>Yan called out.</p>

  <p>Hearing her voice, Luo Zheng raised his head slowly.</p>

  <p>When she saw Luo Zheng's face, Yan took a deep breath and involuntarily retreated a few steps back.</p>

  <p>Rigid, round muscles had swollen to bulges around Luo Zheng's face. These special muscles were as tough and indestructible as powerful and refined magical treasures.</p>

  <p>His eyes, nose and mouth were almost completely invisible due to those muscles. The sunken structure could now protect his eyes, ears, mouth and nose as much as possible.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely horrible to watch. He looked uglier than a fiend.</p>

  <p>Forcing the disgust she was feeling deep inside her, Yan called out once again, "Brother, is that you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and reached out his hand to her as if to say 'I am here, sis!'</p>

  <p>This gesture finally relieved Yan. She took Luo Zheng's palm and pouted softly,</p>

  <p>"Brother, why have you become like this?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry. This is something that I can't control," Luo Zheng replied, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>After he had changed his form, his voice had also changed a lot.</p>

  <p>His voice didn't seem to be coming from his throat anymore. Instead, it was a chesty growl. It was not only hoarse but also quite harsh.</p>

  <p>"His looks don't matter. What we witnessed is that he killed a Chaos Ancient God by himself!" King Ieuan floated to Yan's side. Its bean-sized eyes were full of appraisal for the half-man, half-beast in front of it. "This body may be ugly in your eyes, but it is remarkably strong. It is made for battle!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had killed a Chaos Ancient God by himself.</p>

  <p>He was the first warrior to ever manage that feat in the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had killed Lamont by devouring him, which meant that the killing process had actually made Luo Zheng stronger.</p>

  <p>This man had really lived up to everyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>"Made for battle? Come on. It's too ugly. It doesn't even look human!" Yan said as she sniffed. She wanted the best for her brother.</p>

  <p>Looking at his sister's reluctant expression, Luo Zheng smiled and tried to comfort her, "It's okay! I might be able to change back after I dissipate the Wild God Power out of my system."</p>

  <p>Then his body began to shrink rapidly.</p>

  <p>When it reached about ten feet in height, the shrinking stopped, and Luo Zheng's appearance didn't come back either.</p>

  <p>As he looked at his fluffy hands and his body the size of a gorilla, his face became a little pale, as if he were afraid.</p>

  <p>In the past, whenever he cultivated other strange theurgies, his physical body had also changed, but those changes were controllable, and he had never looked so ugly. If he really couldn't change back, it would be troublesome.</p>

  <p>The problem most likely lay in the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to communicate with the ancestry-level bloodline, a rumble came from the distance.</p>

  <p>Looking in the distance, he saw that the noise had been caused by a crack on the ground.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng, Yan, King Ieuan and the others saw a giant crack appearing in the distance and spreading towards the edge of the Li Shan mountain. It didn't stop until it had touched the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>After seeing what was happening in the distance, which was crystal clear due to its magnitude, King Ieuan took a deep breath and said, "They have ruined the Taoism Province."</p>

  <p>The Taoism Province was the farthest place that could be seen from the Li Shan mountain. It was normal for dozens of provinces to be ruined when several Chaos Ancient Gods fought. It was impossible to imagine just how much havoc they wreaked everywhere they went.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how the Snake Goddess is doing," Yan muttered. She was still worried about the safety of the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. They have their real selves with them, so they should be fine," Luo Zheng comforted her. He was right.</p>

  <p>The strength of the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess was high enough to easily fight against a Chaos Ancient God. Coupled with the strength of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, as well as Gerald and Judson on their side, they were surely at a good advantage, if not a great one.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Before anyone could say something, a second crack appeared, and the entire Taoism Province directly disappeared in a pile of dust.</p>

  <p>Faced with such a fierce battle, Luo Zheng finally couldn't sit still anymore.</p>

  <p>If the people of Li Shan mountain and the Chaos Ancient Gods on their side were really defeated, then they would lose Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The magical ability that the ancestry-level bloodline had just displayed had allowed Luo Zheng to devour Lamont. He could feel Lamont struggling inside his body, but as the ancestry-level bloodline continued to change form, it finally managed to digest Lamont and assimilate his powers for Luo Zheng's use.</p>

  <p>It looked like the ancestry-level bloodline would never let him fall into the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization. This meant that he could easily use the ancestry-level bloodline to his advantage.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and have a look. Yan, you protect Li Shan mountain along with King Ieuan."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng floated in the air and disappeared, leaving a burst of shadows behind him like a rocket trail.</p>

  <p>Two huge cracks had appeared right in the heart of the Taoism Province, like the two jaws of a monster trying to devour the province.</p>

  <p>Giant brown chaotic clouds were floating quietly under those cracks.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they began to surge, and a golden sword light rushed out, which stirred the heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>The sword light extended around for tens of millions of feet and stabbed towards one side of the chaotic clouds.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>It seemed like the golden sword light collided with something solid inside those clouds, and the crisp sound it caused could be heard across tens of millions of miles. Any creature that was too close to the clouds would have been shattered by the intense sound wave!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>However, unable to break that solid object with several consecutive strikes, the attacker rapidly retreated.</p>

  <p>After something rushed out of the chaotic clouds, everyone finally saw who the attacker was. He was Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and he had activated the Wild God Body and was now more than six million feet in height!</p>

  <p>"Oh you want to escape? It's too late for that!"</p>

  <p>Just as Eastern Emperor Taiyi was about to retreat, he bumped into an invisible wall. With a groan, he rolled over and tried to cross the wall from the other side. However, both sides of the wall were sealed by an invisible force field, and he was trapped!</p>

  <p>The next moment, Othniel appeared outside the wall. His single eye, gigantic in size, was filled with a trace of anger and depression.</p>

  <p>The strength that the Li Shan mountain had displayed in this fight was far beyond his expectations. Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had already made several powerful strikes. Gerald and Judson were also on the opponents' team.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Grandmaster of Heaven, Othniel and Herbert would have already been defeated and the battle would have been over.</p>

  <p>While the Grandmaster of Heaven was busy fighting Gerald and Judson, Othniel had managed to find a chance to trap Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't seem too worried by the fact that he had been trapped.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A strong bloodline power darted out of his body, and a golden sword light surged, spreading across the entire visible space.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The sword light bounced back and forth, like laser beams between mirrors in the space that had trapped Eastern Emperor Taiyi. However, the space seemed remarkably stable. It could not be destroyed so easily.</p>

  <p>"It's useless to struggle. Our bloodlines determine the difference in our strength," Othniel sneered.</p>

  <p>With a flash of blue light that rushed out of his eye, several smaller spaces began to appear in a crisscross fashion across the space that had trapped Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Othniel seemed to want to use these small spaces to directly cut Eastern Emperor Taiyi into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>When the small spaces began to appear, they immediately targeted Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body and locked on to him. Numerous large and small cuts appeared on the surface of his body. The cuts continued to deepen rapidly, and blood began to flow out.</p>

  <p>Just as Othniel was about to breathe a sigh of relief with the feeling that he had finally defeated at least one of the opponents, a small figure suddenly appeared at the top of the spaces he had created.</p>
