<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whir...</p>

  <p>The Soul Storm that the humanoid creature mentioned had blown up. The light emitted by the irregular heavy sword began to spread in a chaotic manner.</p>

  <p>Previously, although the sword was bewitched by the Soul Extreme Form, at least a part of it was still sober. It still attacked the humanoid creatures transformed by the black bugs in an orderly fashion.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, the sword seemed to have become completely lost.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was still continuously providing it with energy, but it was transforming the injected energy into various forms and releasing it in random spurts.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>Faint golden light shone from the cracks on the surface of the sword.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a glowing circular ring appeared. The irregular heavy sword spewed out a bright golden beam.</p>

  <p>The light shot out and cut through the air.</p>

  <p>It obviously wasn't targeting anything. It hit a random patch of ground.</p>

  <p>There was a crack as the light sliced down.</p>

  <p>It pierced through the ground of the Jade Pure Realm. The golden light penetrated to the stage below and kept going. It passed through the Grand Plain Stage, the Sanskrit Light Stage, the Blooming Jade Stage, the Constant Glory Stage...</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, almost every Other Shore creature on every stage saw this golden light column as it passed through.</p>

  <p>Some unfortunate Other Shore creatures happened to be in the way of the light, and whatever the light touched melted without a trace.</p>

  <p>Everything in the path of the golden light column was obliterated.</p>

  <p>But the irregular heavy sword was still emitting more energy.</p>

  <p>The circles of golden light appeared one after another around the sword.</p>

  <p>Golden light columns shot outwards in all directions, and there seemed to be nothing on the Other Shore that could stop them.</p>

  <p>Several light columns hit the altar, and a few Monkey Masters and Bird Masters who failed to dodge the beams dissipated upon being touched by the golden light.</p>

  <p>"The Holy Light Extreme Form!" said the humanoid creature, laughing.</p>

  <p>He enjoyed seeing the sword in a state of madness.</p>

  <p>Finally, the irregular heavy sword seemed to have released all the golden light. The surface of the sword began to darken, with traces of green forming on the sharp blade. A green mist rose from the sword.</p>

  <p>The green mist spread out. It contained many small dark green arrows.</p>

  <p>Although these small arrows had a powerful life energy, they were fatal.</p>

  <p>Every life form hit by the arrows would rapidly wither and die.</p>

  <p>Luckily, these dark green arrows were not as swift as the golden beams of light. Because the arrows moved at a slower speed, the people on the altar all managed to dodge the new attack.</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature didn't dodge. He stood calmly in place and reached out to pluck a small arrow in midair. He held it up, examining it closely. "This is the Life Extreme Form, the arrow of death..."</p>

  <p>Then the green mist began to dissipate as flashes of lightning shot out from the sword. It was followed by dark orbs that floated like black moons in the surrounding air.</p>

  <p>"What the hell does it want to do?" Zheng was still tightly holding onto the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>"It must have gone crazy," said the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Then cut off the energy supply!" Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>Although the irregular heavy sword didn't hurt Zheng as it attacked, many others were hurt. Several people on the altar were killed. More were dying at present, unable to resist the latest lightning attack released by the sword.</p>

  <p>"If I cut off the energy supply, how will you deal with that guy?" asked the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature was waiting, looking unafraid. Indeed, he even seemed entertained.</p>

  <p>Once the irregular heavy sword stopped attacking, he would definitely attack Zheng without hesitation.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng could not let the irregular heavy sword just keep spewing out mad attacks at random. That was not an acceptable solution.</p>

  <p>Zheng gripped the sword tightly, beginning to feel anxious. He came up with one idea after another, but found major flaws in each one. He dismissed every plan that came to mind until it seemed he was out of ideas.</p>

  <p>A loud crack reverberated in the air.</p>

  <p>An invisible force field had suddenly appeared on the surface of the irregular heavy sword. It was the Force Field Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>When the invisible force field surged out, it pushed away Zheng's hand, and the sword finally slipped out of his grasp.</p>

  <p>"It's time!" cried the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>His compound eyes flashed and he went straight for the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Once it had lost its energy supply, the irregular heavy sword was no more than a piece of scrap iron, so it was easily controlled.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression darkened as he quickly reached out, trying to grab back the hilt of the sword.</p>

  <p>Just as his hand brushed across the sword hilt, Zheng suddenly felt a unique aura.</p>

  <p>'Black cloud, the Probability Extreme Form?...'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought. The idea crossed his mind unexpectedly, and an ominous premonition rose in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the ominous premonition became reality.</p>

  <p>There was a series of loud bangs, as the humanoid creature launched a violent attack on Zheng in the Probability Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>With a boom, Zheng was smashed into the ground.</p>

  <p>A billowing cloud of dust rose up over his sprawled form.</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature grabbed the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>The people on the altar watched with their mouths open, shocked at the sudden turn of events.</p>

  <p>Even the least intelligent warriors understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>"It's all over. It's all over..." Gonggong muttered. He had turned into a figure of water, becoming liquid and transparent all throughout his body in order to avoid being hurt by the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, Alphonse, and Corbett were silent.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters and the Bird Masters looked stunned.</p>

  <p>Their only hope had been shattered. In that instant, they were overcome by a terrible emptiness and distress.</p>

  <p>Zheng lay in the rubble where he had fallen. His face was full of anger, and he struggled to rise, unwilling to accept this outcome.</p>

  <p>He had thought that he could grasp an infinite amount of power, but he was wrong. His opponent now had taken away such power easily. It was enough to plunge anyone into despair.</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature howled.</p>

  <p>He appeared to be bursting with excitement.</p>

  <p>He held the irregular heavy sword with both hands. Six pairs of compound eyes looked up at the sky as his mouth opened, forming unfamiliar sounds.</p>

  <p>Although no one knew what he was saying, the emotions behind his words were obvious.</p>

  <p>It was the exhilaration of one who had survived many vicissitudes of life, and managed at last to obtain something he had been pursuing for a long time.</p>

  <p>His excitement formed a sharp contrast with the desperation of the crowd.</p>

  <p>It made everyone else even more depressed.</p>

  <p>"This day has come too late, but at last I've taken it back. Clarence, it's a pity you can't see this," said the humanoid creature with a sharp bark of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Taken it back? Did that sword originally belong to him?" the Snake Goddess asked quietly, her head tilted as she watched the celebration of the humanoid creature. Just now, she had hurriedly returned to the Other Shore after informing the ancestry-level bloodline that Zheng had lost his mind and fallen into an illusion.</p>

  <p>"Who is the Clarence he mentioned?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Fuxi spread out his hands. "Does it even matter now?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>Of course, they understood they were in dire straits.</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature raised the irregular heavy sword, looking around at everyone watching him. "I have not felt this excited in a long time! I'll kill you and offer your lives to the sword!"</p>

  <p>A buzz filled the air, as the blade of the irregular heavy sword flashed with a dark purple energy.</p>

  <p>After several moments, purple cracks began spreading around the humanoid creature, and black energy balls emerged one after another from the cracks. These energy balls contained a violent and terrifying power.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" shouted the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of purple black energy balls rained down from the sky, as though the God of Death had come.</p>

  <p>Some people started to run, trying to escape. Others stayed where they were. Some even changed their forms, trying to defend themselves against this new attack.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stood still. These purple cracks were spreading very quickly. Before long, the entire Jade Pure Realm would be covered with purple black energy balls. When the purple black energy balls covered the whole area, they would die no matter where they had run.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Zheng, it seems that you can't escape this," she sighed. She looked towards Zheng, who was lying on the ground in the distance.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng had failed to meet the Snake Goddess's expectations.</p>

  <p>It was not his fault. The existence he faced had already far exceeded the limits of his abilities and resistance. It was a miracle that he had held on for so long.</p>

  <p>Zheng had always managed to pull miracles out of thin air, but he couldn't create miracles forever.</p>
