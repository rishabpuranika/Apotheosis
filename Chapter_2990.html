<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2990 Revenge </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The guard's eyes widened; he couldn't hide his surprise at the old man's words. "Master Baber, is it not better if we go to the Cyan Brocade Plain first?"</p>

  <p>The Mice League did not carry a good reputation in the Source World. It was rare for anyone to buy news from the Mice League, only if they were left with no choice. Moreover, the old man Baber Qi already had the location where his grandson died. It was more logical to investigate there first.</p>

  <p>Baber Qi's nostrils flared. He was very anxious to get revenge. However, the words of the guard made sense. Swallowing his anger, he said, "Okay.</p>

  <p>Let's go to the Cyan Brocade Plain first."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! They hastily took their leave.</p>

  <p>Baber Qi chose to pass through Excellence City directly.</p>

  <p>As he flew past the Excellence City, he didn't even try to restrain his aura. A fierce killing intent permeated the atmosphere of the whole city, attracting the attention of the divine citizens living there.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful Other Shore Realm warrior! He is so aggressive!"</p>

  <p>"Will something bad happen to the Excellence City?"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Even if the powerful warrior were to do something to the city, I'm sure our city lord will protect us."</p>

  <p>Although many Other Shore Realm warriors would visit the Excellence City, the vast majority of them would stay in the East Port. Seldom did they stay at the poverty-stricken Excellence City. It was even more out of the blue for a powerful warrior like Baber Qi to fly past the city without restraining their killing intent.</p>

  <p>In the city lord's mansion situated at the center of the city, a middle-aged man with a pot belly sensed the killing intent in the atmosphere. His expression darkened.</p>

  <p>Although the Excellence City was but a small and poor land, no Other Shore Realm warrior dared challenge the entire city like this before. As he looked up at the sky, he squinted thoughtfully. "Baber Qi? Who managed to piss him off?"</p>

  <p>Although there was no super force in the Gracious Province, there were still some powerful clans.</p>

  <p>The Qi Clan, led by Baber Qi, was one of them. The Qi Clan was located in the center of Gracious Province, and had been well managed by Baber Qi over the years.</p>

  <p>The city lord bore this in mind as Baber Qi flew through his city. In the end, he decided to let the warrior pass through the Excellence City without conflict.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, Baber Qi made it to the Cyan Brocade Plain. He was accompanied by multitudes of guards.</p>

  <p>Although the cave on the Cyan Brocade Plain was very secluded, it was not difficult to pinpoint the exact place, as they had already confirmed the location prior. After some scouting, one of the guards rushed to Baber Qi.</p>

  <p>"Master Baber, we found the cave!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go." In a flash, Baber Qi entered the cave.</p>

  <p>They hadn't been in the cave long when Baber Qi's eyes flashed as he spotted something on the stone wall. He reached out to knock on it. Sure enough, he pulled out a small creature from a crevice on the stone wall.</p>

  <p>The guard next to him glanced at what he was doing. "It's a Noxious Army Ant raised by Guido. We've found the exact place."</p>

  <p>Baber Qi rubbed his two fingers together, squishing the Noxious Army Ant.</p>

  <p>A green shadow shrouded his hand, giving him the strength to press even harder on the ant.</p>

  <p>Even a consummate True God would have difficulty killing a Noxious Army Ant. Baber Qi, however, crushed it to pieces with a simple pinch.</p>

  <p>"Allen always hung around with these shady characters. That was why he ended up like this!" Baber Qi exclaimed with a click of his tongue as he headed deeper into the cave.</p>

  <p>After a short while, they reached the innermost part of the cave.</p>

  <p>Prior to their arrival, Zheng had burned the corpses of those consummate True Gods so as to destroy the evidence. Only traces of messy fighting were left.</p>

  <p>Baber Qi looked around as he stood at the position of the tomb. He closed his eyes, lost in his thoughts. Suddenly, his eyes shot open, his expression darkening. "There seemed to have been a powerful ghost here. How did my grandson manage to offend such a ghost?"</p>

  <p>He initially thought his grandson had been murdered. However, the evidence pointed towards his death being caused by a ghost. This news calmed him down somewhat.</p>

  <p>Another guard lowered his head and said, "If a ghost killed Mister Allen, it would be impossible for the ghost to destroy his body."</p>

  <p>Baber Qi nodded gravely. "Maybe Allen's friends were afraid I would take revenge, and ran away with his body. Or perhaps the body was destroyed by someone else." He paused for a while. "Let's go to the Mice League. I must find my grandson's body!"</p>

  <p>Exiting the cave, the group of warriors returned to Excellence City. Without any hesitation, they headed straight for the Mice League.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a huge flying ship of more than ten thousand feet wide arrived at the East Port of the Excellence City. Four figures in cyan materialized from the flying ship? three men and a woman.</p>

  <p>The woman's face was a deathly pale, and her figure shuddered from fatigue. It could easily be seen that she was weak. As she staggered forward, it was as though she was a walking corpse. Even so, there was a morbid beauty about her.</p>

  <p>The four people who dismounted the flying ship were all powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm. However, the status of the woman was obviously much higher than that of the three men.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who Kenelm Lai is?" the woman said weakly. "Let's go to the city lord's mansion and ask him about it."</p>

  <p>A handsome man bowed before her, his hands folded neatly in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I will lead the way for you."</p>

  <p>The woman nodded slightly, and without any further hesitation, they headed to the city lord.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Baber Qi and his warriors had made it to the Mice League's house. He tossed a thousand divine crystals in the direction of the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>The Mice League members always treated people differently according to their social standing. If a consummate True God and an Other Shore Realm warrior came to buy the same piece of news, the difference in price was huge.</p>

  <p>Baber Qi knew this. He could have sent his guards to buy the news, but he wanted to hear the news himself, for the sake of his grandson.</p>

  <p>After the Ear Mouse took in these divine crystals, a magic array was finally presented in front of Baber Qi. It was the scene of his grandson entering the cave.</p>

  <p>"I want to see the result," Baber Qi said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse nodded and then squeaked, "A powerful soul pressure burst out from this cave. We, the mice, could not get close, so we were unable to catch everything. But you should be interested in the following scenes."</p>

  <p>Then Baber Qi saw the scene wherein Kenelm and the others burned the corpses.</p>

  <p>Baber Qi snorted angrily. He whipped out a bunch of divine crystals and threw them in front of the Ear Mouse. "Tell me where they are."</p>

  <p>Baber Qi left the Mice League and headed straight to a place in the Excellence City with his guards.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Baber Qi directly flew down from thousands of feet high, landing on the place where Kenelm lived. It was a large house. However, the moment Baber Qi set foot in the house, all the rooms collapsed in an instant. The ground cracked, forming crevices reminiscent of a spider's web.</p>

  <p>"Kenelm Lai! Get your ass over here!" Baber Qi roared, and a stream of air spread out in all directions. Cracks suddenly snaked their way through the houses surrounding Kenelm's. The divine citizens living here suddenly grew deaf from the sheer force of Baber Qi's energy, blood gushing out of their ears.</p>

  <p>Kenelm had been hanging about with Zheng these days. At this moment, the two of them were having a chat over a cup of tea in the backyard. Zheng had been eager to learn something about the Gracious Province and the Source World.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, when they saw the house collapse in front of them, both immediately fell silent. Their expressions darkened as they locked eyes with the figure emanating a fierce killing intent in front of them.</p>
