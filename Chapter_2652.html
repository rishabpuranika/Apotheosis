<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2652 One Against Three </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the other side of the roof, there stood a thin young man. He was Bergen Bai, the one whom Bonnie had called out earlier.</p>

  <p>In his left hand, he was carrying something like a terrifying trophy— Becker Cao's head.</p>

  <p>As one of the exiles in the Fire Melting race, Becker Cao had been as significant in his race as Emily was in the Snake Goddess race, or as Timotheus was in the Nine Li race. Even if the Strength Equalizing Theurgy had worked, he was unquestionably powerful.</p>

  <p>But somehow, he had not only been defeated but decapitated by Bergen Bai.</p>

  <p>In his right hand, Bergen was holding a thick heavy sword. The blue light on the surface of the sword constantly sparkled, emitting a terrifying energy fluctuation.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was going up against four exiles, including the valiant Leopold and Ramzi from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Now that they had racked up several wounds on their bodies, both Leopold and Ramzi looked at Bergen with vigilance and caution. The once unknown Bergen had now become a formidable enemy in their eyes.</p>

  <p>After all, the strength Bergen had displayed far exceeded that of the others in black robes.</p>

  <p>Becker Cao had even been killed just because he had underestimated his enemy.</p>

  <p>Even as Bergen fought with Leopold and Ramzi, he managed to slay more than ten Wild Gods and five or six exiles.</p>

  <p>During the fight, when he noticed the stir around Zheng, he promptly withdrew from the battle and rushed toward the other side.</p>

  <p>"Really? Bonnie, are you asking me for help?" Bergen asked as he looked down from the roof.</p>

  <p>Among the younger generation of the Warden race, Bonnie and Arvin were the most popular ones.</p>

  <p>However, in terms of strength, there was a big gap between them and Bergen.</p>

  <p>The only reason Bergen wasn't popular was because he was remote and arrogant, and not very well-liked within his race.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the Lou Clan was the largest clan in the Warden race, and it was from this clan that the race would choose a leader.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the relationship between Bergen and the siblings had always been strained.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap! Don't you know what time it is now? Don't you see that he is different from the others?" Bonnie yelled sternly.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Warden race was fighting a life-and-death battle. How could Bergen joke around their usual rivalry at a time like this?</p>

  <p>Bergen took another look at Zheng. When he saw the green light constantly flowing on Zheng's arm, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. "Well, this is interesting. This guy has actually overcome the Strength Equalizing Theurgy!"</p>

  <p>Then, with a cold chuckle, he casually tossed aside the head in his hand and jumped down. As he jumped, the heavy sword in his hand emitted a blue light, forming a wide arc in the air, right toward Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was already busy trying to fend off attacks from Bonnie and Arvin, groaned inwardly.</p>

  <p>Now that Bergen had joined the battle, he would be under a lot more pressure than before.</p>

  <p>As he looked at Bergen's sword heading toward him, his body suddenly shrank. At the same time, he cut off Arvin's butterflies and Bonnie's flying knives, and then summoned all his strength and poured it into his blade.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>His long sword curved up, colliding with Bergen's heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Channeling the descent power, Bergen used his sword to hack from top to bottom. It was a formidable blow!</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his long sword and put most of his strength into it. Once his sword touched Bergen's, it became heavier and heavier, cushioning most of the force from Bergen's sword.</p>

  <p>As soon as Bergen landed, Zheng's long sword became crooked. Zheng used this force to push Bergen aside by a few steps, buying himself a few seconds to breathe.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! What a great swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>Everyone around them couldn't help but marvel at this scene.</p>

  <p>If there was no Strength Equalizing Theurgy, what Zheng had just done would have been nothing in the eyes of these exiles.</p>

  <p>But now, they all thought that Zheng's skill was amazing.</p>

  <p>"Let's help Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"How can we let Zheng single-handedly take on three of them?"</p>

  <p>"Let's stop that brother and sister!"</p>

  <p>How could they allow Zheng to face three people alone?</p>

  <p>But the moment they made a move, several black-robed men from the Warden race rushed up to stop them.</p>

  <p>Bergen, who had been cleverly forced back by Zheng's sword, also looked up at Zheng with surprise.</p>

  <p>"I told you not to be careless. This guy is not easy to deal with!" Arvin muttered.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>Bergen asked casually before rushing toward Zheng again with the heavy sword on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>In terms of martial arts skills, Bergen was not as good as Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he had Bonnie and Arvin fighting alongside him; they could trap Zheng like a huge net.</p>

  <p>Zheng would have to tear through this big net first in order to deal with Bergen's sword. In the few seconds after he had managed to force Bergen back a few steps, he had somehow found himself trapped!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Leopold, Ramzi, and the exiles from the other races burned with anxiety.</p>

  <p>They didn't know how Zheng had surpassed the limits of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, but they knew that he might be the only one who could confront the Warden race head-on.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful Leopold and Ramzi were afraid of the blue energy.</p>

  <p>After all, the weapons they were using were ordinary and would immediately shatter on contact with the blue energy. There was no way they could get around that disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Even Emily, who was not far away, felt the same way. Since the Warden race had the Chaos Ancient God's blessing, they had a great advantage in the contest of strength.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the only one who could resist their enemies head-on by relying on the green light!</p>

  <p>He was their only hope right now.</p>

  <p>They all badly wanted to help him out of the tough spot that he was in, but they themselves were busy trying to fight off the black-robed men.</p>

  <p>Both Arvin and Bonnie became calmer. Bonnie's flying knives suddenly turned into a few streaks of light and shot toward Zheng's weak points in an almost fatal attack.</p>

  <p>And although the speed of the butterflies that Arvin had summoned was slow, there were still a large number of them. The trajectory of their flying was unpredictable and hard to guard against.</p>

  <p>As for Bergen, Arvin and Bonnie had deliberately left just enough of a gap for him to pass through, and from time to time, he would launch a fatal strike at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly retreated while he warded off their attacks, but at last, he was forced into a corner.</p>

  <p>"It's close," Bergen said flatly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he no longer looked down on his opponent.</p>

  <p>Bergen was confident that he would be able to defeat even the most powerful of exiles, but this guy in front of him was able to block attacks from the three of them combined.</p>

  <p>It was obvious to him that if he fought Zheng one-on-one, he would be no match for him.</p>

  <p>Hearing Bergen's words, Bonnie stretched out both of her hands. Under the condensation of the blue light, more than a dozen flying knives materialized and turned into streaks of light that shot toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Arvin's eyes flashed as well. His blue butterflies fluttered faster and faster, forming a small storm that flew straight toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>The brother and sister were trying their best to take down their opponent.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a blue light began to circle the heavy sword in Bergen's hand as he rushed toward Zheng.</p>
