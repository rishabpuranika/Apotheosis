<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 256 The Heaven-destroying Cudgel (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still, without operating his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The four men stood in four distinct positions with their heaven-destroying cudgels in hand. They aimed their weapons and struck at Zheng simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The four of them were at grade five of the nature level and had extraordinary strength. Moreover, the heaven-destroying cudgels could strike the body with a force unmatched.</p>

  <p>Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof!</p>

  <p>The weapons hit Zheng's body hard, making dull sounds.</p>

  <p>'People in the Commandment Hall do have some methods. The ordinary nature creatures could be beaten to death if hit hundreds of times in this manner, ' Zheng thought, still not budging an inch. 'But my body is a middle-grade spiritual weapon. The cudgels' hit can't injure me with their moderate force!'</p>

  <p>Under the beating of the cudgels, warm currents continuously surged in Zheng's body, soaking his belly.</p>

  <p>The four nature creatures kept hitting at him hard. After all, it was a rare opportunity.</p>

  <p>Poof! Poof! Poof!</p>

  <p>They hit him more than a hundred times in one breath.</p>

  <p>Zheng still stood unmoved and looked at Murry, who was looking on from a distance.</p>

  <p>Murry was puzzled. The heaven-destroying cudgel was a good weapon to strike a nature creature. In the past, it had proven to be useful in beating them half to death. Why did this young man look unharmed even after being hit so many times?</p>

  <p>"Hit him hard!" Murry shouted.</p>

  <p>The four men were masters at grade five and had an endless stream of power in their bodies. At Murry's words, the force in their hands increased in an instant. In no time, sweat was built on their foreheads.</p>

  <p>Their cudgels struck blow after blow at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Poof...</p>

  <p>The cudgels pounded Zheng over and over, but he only felt a sense of happiness as the warmth soaked through his belly, lulling him into a kind of comfort.</p>

  <p>If the cudgels continued to thrash him, the warmth would stroke his belly all day long, and in a short period of time, his strength would increase from grade one of the nature level to grade two...</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, good things didn't happen so frequently or easily. He needed to seize this opportunity with both hands to make sure it happened.</p>

  <p>If they sensed something wrong, they would stop hitting him. Suddenly, Zheng twisted his face in agony and screamed.</p>

  <p>"Ah... Oh..." He gritted his teeth and howled as if in pain, looking like he couldn't stand it.</p>

  <p>Murry saw his expression and smirked. The guy finally couldn't bear it.</p>

  <p>"Beat him. Hit him hard! I want to see a fight!"</p>

  <p>If Zheng was beaten to death, Murry would get into trouble. According to the rules, the Commandment Hall could not put a disciple to death.</p>

  <p>This little episode was not too troublesome for him though. In any case, someone or the other would help him cover it up.</p>

  <p>"Ah, ah..."</p>

  <p>The heaven-destroying cudgels beat Zheng incessantly. His screams echoed in the Commandment Hall.</p>

  <p>Tired of the thousands of beatings, the four men soon grew exhausted. It had taken up all of their strength. However, they soon sensed that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Even after being beaten up for so long, Zheng still stood on steady legs.</p>

  <p>The expression on his face was miserable, but his complexion seemed fine. He didn't seem injured or hurt. He actually looked like he found the hits pleasant. Was he enjoying this? What the hell was going on?</p>

  <p>Murry too perceived that something was odd. The man screamed without inflection. His voice didn't break and he didn't choke on gasps when he yelled in pain. Did the bludgeoning actually affect him, or was he faking it? How could it not hurt him? Was he not afraid of being clubbed to death?</p>

  <p>That was possible!</p>

  <p>Murry knew that the heaven-destroying cudgel was ineffective against the masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm, but many nature creatures who were struck by the weapon in the past eventually knelt on the ground and implored for their lives, their bloody wounds clear evidence of their pain.</p>

  <p>How could it have no effect on Zheng?</p>

  <p>Impossible!</p>

  <p>"Hit him hard! I don't believe you are not afraid of being beaten!"</p>

  <p>The four men thrashed him harder, putting even more strength behind the blows of their cudgels.</p>

  <p>If such strong power was directed against a large boulder, it could turn it to dust. Against a block of gold or iron, it would cast a depression in it.</p>

  <p>But against Zheng's body, it left no injuries whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The nature creatures didn't have bottomless stamina. After hitting him with all their strength, the four men finally huffed their breaths and gave up, feeling like they had lost.</p>

  <p>Now that they had used up all their energy, Zheng dropped his masquerade and laughed out loud. "Hit me then. Continue to hit me. I haven't enjoyed this enough!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the expression on Zheng's face, Murry heaved a deep breath, wondering if he was dealing with a monster.</p>

  <p>The four men stared back at him blankly, finding themselves in a fix.</p>

  <p>They still held the heaven-destroying cudgels in their hands.</p>

  <p>There was no point in continuing to strike the boy because he was not afraid of being beaten. The four of them were merely wasting their respective strengths. But they couldn't stop hitting him, because Murry hadn't yet ordered them to stop...</p>

  <p>They waved the heaven-destroying cudgels about, becoming more spiritless.</p>

  <p>"There's no strength behind your attacks. Don't do it." Zheng sighed and shook his head, but the strength in his body expanded gradually, until it shook with a tremor.</p>

  <p>When the next blow of the heaven-destroying cudgel fell on his body, it repelled against the great force in him and the weapon shattered into several pieces, falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately removed the life-vitality rope of thorns that was tied around his wrists.</p>

  <p>"My time is valuable. I didn't come back to Cloud Sect for this mischief.</p>

  <p>I know who was behind what happened today, but I advise you not to get involved with me. Otherwise you will regret it!" Zheng said, pointing at Murry who stood on the platform, before turning to leave.</p>
