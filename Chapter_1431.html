<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every member of the Demon Night race knew very well what Xun looked like and what she smelled like. To some extent, they were even more familiar with her than with their parents.</p>

  <p>From the moment they were born, they would be baptized in front of the queens' statues. The Queen of Life could make their life energy grow stronger, the Queen of Punishment could make them observe the laws of the Demon Night race, and the Queen of Killings could boost their courage, making them understand the killing way.</p>

  <p>At this moment, although Xun was now only a sword spirit, her soul force had already recovered 60%. The Cold Plum Blood Spear in her hand exuded a majestic Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>As the Demon Night martial artists of the Ginkgo Pavilion witnessed this, their hearts suddenly trembled. They realized that their queen had actually arrived…</p>

  <p>The Dark World was a remote area where many races gathered. The whole supreme world was mainly a place for trading. Although the human race, Demon Night, and ogre race all had a tenth grade sacred place here, among the various races, they were still considered relatively weak forces.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when these warriors of the Demon Night saw the sudden appearance of their queen, they were all stunned!</p>

  <p>To them, the personal visit of any queen here was an unparalleled honor.</p>

  <p>In the hearts of the members of the Demon Night race, a queen was even more important than a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump...</p>

  <p>All of the Demon Night members knelt down right away to honor their queen, Xun.</p>

  <p>Floating high up in the air, Xun looked down at her subjects. Her gaze finally landed on the woman in pink. "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"My queen, you can call me Nela," the woman in pink answered sincerely.</p>

  <p>In fact, a few months ago, all the members of the Demon Night knew that their Queen of Killings had returned to the Upper World, and that she had a conflict with the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>At that time, Xun had used Zheng's Roaring Token to quarrel with the Queen of Punishment. Not just the Demon Night race, everyone knew about this.</p>

  <p>After all, this was an internal conflict within the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Some of the races that hated the Demon Night race was expecting to watch a good show. After all, the return of Xun would definitely cause an internal strife within the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Xun coldly nodded, and then continued, "Nela, I want all of you to make an oath of allegiance to me, in front of the statue."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Nela and her other subordinates uneasily raised their heads— discomfort evident on their faces. The task Xun was asking them to do was extremely difficult.</p>

  <p>Actually, they had the same concern as the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place did back then. Even though Xun was their queen, she was only one of their queens as the Demon Night race did not only have one queen.</p>

  <p>For so many years, the three queens had been advancing and retreating together. Each of them performed their respective positions and led the huge Demon Night race. But once they made an oath, it was equivalent to breaking away from the protection of the other two queens and becoming loyal to only one of the three queens!</p>

  <p>Back then, Amber didn't have to decide. At that time, Xun did not force the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place to choose because a sacred place in the Lower World would not be of much help to her and it wouldn't really change anything. But it was different now. Xun and Yao had already declared war against each other. From that moment, she decided she would take her own power back and eventually return to the throne.</p>

  <p>So before she came here, Xun had only asked Luo Zheng to do one thing.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of masters he faced, he only had one goal in mind when he charged into the Ginkgo Pavilion and that was to destroy the statues of the other two queens!</p>

  <p>Any Demon Night tribe would have the queens' statues at their place.</p>

  <p>The reason for this was so that the queens of the Demon Night could observe what was happening in every tribe through the statues. They could also communicate with any of the sacred places. Even though there was a small chance that Yao would be watching, Xun still asked Luo Zheng to smash the statues the moment they arrived for good measure.</p>

  <p>Seeing the anxiety on Nela's and the others' faces, Xun laughed coldly. "Is it really that difficult to make you swear an oath to your queen? Or do you think that the Queen of Killings is no longer worthy of your trust?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, they became even more panicked.</p>

  <p>The three queens were very different from one another. When the Demon Night members faced the Queen of Life, they felt boundless vitality.</p>

  <p>When it came to the Queen of Punishment, they were reverent but truthfully, the majority of them liked the Queen of Killings the most.</p>

  <p>When facing the Queen of Killings, they could feel the endless killing intent. It was able to awaken the courage deep in their souls, allowing them to be even braver and more skillful in battles!</p>

  <p>But right now, the Queen of Killings' power had collapsed. The old members that had followed the Queen of Killings had either died or lived in seclusion. Under such circumstances, choosing to stand by Xun's side was definitely not a wise choice!</p>

  <p>If they chose her and this spread out, Xun could instantly be exterminated by Yao and they would definitely be implicated.</p>

  <p>Yao was the queen in charge of the punishment, and also the cruelest queen of her kind. If they were to be implicated, the entire Demon Night of the Dark World would have to die with Xun!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sat on a railing in the Ginkgo Pavilion. Even though his face was blank, he was feeling nervous on the inside.</p>

  <p>He promised that he would help Xun return to the throne, and it was something he needed to do. It didn't matter when he did it as long as he did it. What they were doing now was the first step to get Xun back to her throne. But it was still a little difficult for them to decide right now.</p>

  <p>If they were to refuse to take the oath, it might cause trouble.</p>

  <p>Xun's whereabouts would be exposed, and Zheng's whereabouts would be exposed as well. With Zheng's current strength, he had no power to resist the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>For Luo Zheng and Xun, this was an adventure, but one that they had to take no matter what!</p>

  <p>Xun's face looked extremely solemn while the faint soul pressure released from her contained an Mu Ning of supreme majesty. As the pressure came down, even the face of Nela turned deathly pale.</p>

  <p>For them, it was an extremely difficult decision to make, but every member of Demon Night present knew that this was something they couldn't avoid. The conflict between the two queens had long reached a point where they could not tolerate each other anymore, so naturally only one of them would be staying.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't say anything else. If her efforts to come here herself to get the support of her subjects was wasted then she would never be able to return to the throne.</p>

  <p>Time ticked by. After five minutes…</p>

  <p>Nela's eyes glistened with determination as she raised her head and swore, "My queen is the glory, and the glory is my life! With eternal killing, to guard the territory of our race…"</p>

  <p>After Nela took the lead to take the oath, the other Demon Night martial artists also followed her and began making their oaths!</p>

  <p>As they swore the oath, the only remaining statue - Queen of Killings glowed with a faint red light. With her eyes gleaming, Xun listened attentively to their oaths.</p>

  <p>The oath of the Ginkgo pavilion was the first step for Xun's return to the throne.</p>

  <p>After everyone made their vows, Xun said lightly, "You can all stand up now."</p>

  <p>Nela nodded and led the many warriors of the Demon Night to their feet.</p>

  <p>Since she had made a vow to the queen, it meant that from now on she would only serve Xun as her queen.</p>

  <p>However, to them, this was still a supreme honor. Every day, they would worship the queens' statues but most of them would never be able to see their queens for their whole life. Now that Xun had come here personally, how could they reject her?</p>

  <p>Although it was a painful choice for them to give up on the other two queens, it was still a great opportunity for them to grow.</p>

  <p>Once Xun returned to the throne, they would definitely be valued for their support and loyalty.</p>

  <p>"My queen, what can I do for you?" Nela asked as she rose. Xun coming here definitely meant that there were very important things to be accomplished. Otherwise, she wouldn't have taken the initiative to come here herself.</p>

  <p>Xun said simply, "I want you to head to the Eternal Night World to find someone and give this jade slip to her."</p>

  <p>As Xun spoke, Luo Zheng, who was by her side, took out a jade slip. It was a jade slip that had been created beforehand and contained extremely important information.</p>

  <p>"Eternal Night World…" Nela raised her eyebrows. She also knew that the Eternal Night World was the supreme world where the Queen of Killings used to live. Since the Queen of Killings disappeared, the entire Eternal Night World was taken over by the Queen of Punishment.</p>

  <p>However, since she had already taken an oath of allegiance to the Queen of Killings, Xun's orders were not to be disobeyed. She had no reason to refuse even if she was asked to go to a mountain of swords and a sea of flames.</p>
