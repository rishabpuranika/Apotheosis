<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This time, their reason for coming to the Ghost Altar had nothing to do with becoming Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter who went up to the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>Even a guy like Decker would do.</p>

  <p>As long as there was no human among the twelve Great Ghost Priests, it would always prove difficult for them to touch base with the human heroes.</p>

  <p>Besides, with Decker's physique, even if the twelve Great Ghost Priests agreed, the hatred-level Treacherous Being that Decker would fuse with probably would not.</p>

  <p>Although Decker's face showed a trace of indignation, he was actually thrilled deep inside.</p>

  <p>If he were to be honest, when he found out that the Great Ghost Priests were chosen simply by luck, he felt a sudden pang of resentment.</p>

  <p>Why were only members of the three great races allowed to enter the Ghost Altar all this time? Why were the other races disqualified from trying their luck?</p>

  <p>Then again, the Night View Island had always been that cruel.</p>

  <p>The weak races never had a say.</p>

  <p>It was just a matter of course for the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race, and the Grand Mighty race to control the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, now he had a chance.</p>

  <p>The chance was slim, of course, but he was still willing to give it a shot.</p>

  <p>Without any objection from Luo Zheng and the others, Decker hurriedly stepped into the center of the platform and pressed the glazed sheet in his hand against the stone ball.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The stone ball began to rotate.</p>

  <p>Rays of blue light flashed at the twelve entrances above the Ghost Altar as another twelve Great Ghost Priests were selected.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze quickly swept across the twelve. His face fell in disappointment.</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of creatures in strange shapes, but there were still no humans.</p>

  <p>The twelve Great Ghost Priests looked down at Decker with disdain.</p>

  <p>There was actually no strict required strength to come up to the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>However, the Night View Island and the Ghost Mountain had followed the law of the jungle all this time, so only the strongest could go up to the Ghost Altar until now.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Great Ghost Priests all used to be among the best of Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Decker was much too weak in comparison.</p>

  <p>"I haven't gone out for many years, but have the Night View Island's standards fallen so low?" a Great Ghost Priest lamented.</p>

  <p>"Such a loser dares to come up to the Ghost Altar? How shameless," another Great Ghost Priest mocked.</p>

  <p>"We disagree!"</p>

  <p>"We object!"</p>

  <p>"We object!"</p>

  <p>Most of the Great Ghost Priests actually didn't care about what happened in the outside world.</p>

  <p>So unless their interest was piqued, no matter who went up to the Ghost Altar, they would object to the applicant almost by default.</p>

  <p>To become a Great Ghost Priest, one had to gain the approval of at least eight of the twelve Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>Decker, like Fuxi, had just been rejected.</p>

  <p>The difference was that Fuxi was rejected because he was human. Decker was rejected because he was too weak. Decker, in fact, was rejected more quickly.</p>

  <p>As the Great Ghost Priests vetoed Decker's application, a white Treacherous Being burrowed out from the stone ball.</p>

  <p>He turned out to be a hedgehog, not as ferocious-looking as other Treacherous Beings. He was actually quite adorable with his small round body.</p>

  <p>This hatred-level Treacherous Being was very excited to have finally come out.</p>

  <p>He had always been very interested in the outside world.</p>

  <p>He roamed the Ghost Altar for a few moments before he began to be drawn to the creature standing on the altar. The creature's hand was emitting a strange aura, which somehow made the hedgehog feel at peace.</p>

  <p>He approached Decker and put his sharp nose in Decker's hand, greedily sniffing the aura.</p>

  <p>Most Treacherous Beings were attracted to the Arcana, and this hedgehog was no exception.</p>

  <p>All the Treacherous Beings that appeared on the Ghost Altar were at the hatred level.</p>

  <p>They were all very powerful when they were alive. Even after they died, they continued to possess this strength. They usually proved the hardest to lure.</p>

  <p>However, this hedgehog was different from other hatred-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Other hatred-level Treacherous Beings were either powerhouses in the Abstruse Energy World or core figures in the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>The hedgehog, however, was a pet when he was alive.</p>

  <p>He had belonged to Orlando, the Monkey Spirit King. His name was Cary.</p>

  <p>As Orlando's pet, his strength was undoubtedly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>However, he had spent most his life just curling up beside Orlando, never having the chance to fight anyone. He had always been but a sheltered pet, unfamiliar with the ways of the world.</p>

  <p>After death, Cary did not change much. He still stayed beside his master as a friendly-type Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>He rarely appeared on the third floor of the Ghost Mountain, so only a few of the Great Ghost Priests knew of his existence.</p>

  <p>This time, however, he had left his master by accident as he was unintentionally drawn out.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests suddenly realized that there was a Treacherous Being that they had never seen before, now nuzzling Decker at the center of the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Is there such a Treacherous Being on the third floor?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he doesn't live here."</p>

  <p>"Just take him back."</p>

  <p>The twelve Great Ghost Priests had a way to control the hatred-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>The stone ball began to rotate again, this time, trying to re-absorb Cary.</p>

  <p>Normally, hatred-level Treacherous Beings would not resist.</p>

  <p>However, Cary was an exception. He had now moved on to sniff Decker's glazed sheet, trying to get close to him.</p>

  <p>But Decker acted differently.</p>

  <p id="top_14">Although the hedgehog's aura was not strong, he knew if he unsheathed his claws, he would still be able to easily kill him.</p>

  <p>Decker grew pale as he gritted his teeth and tried to keep himself from trembling.</p>

  <p>When Cary realized that the stone ball was trying to suck him back, his eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p>

  <p>His body rolled into a half circle, his nose never leaving Decker's hand. He ejected a sharp spine from his back and toward the stone ball.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The stone ball was penetrated.</p>

  <p>Countless cracks appeared on its surface.</p>

  <p>It was broken just like that!</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests above the Ghost Altar were stunned at the sight.</p>

  <p>This white round stone ball was a sacred object in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>But the hedgehog destroyed it so easily!</p>

  <p>Though extremely frightened, Decker had realized something.</p>

  <p>This hedgehog liked the Arcana very much.</p>

  <p>This was the foundation to the fusion with Treacherous Beings!</p>

  <p>Decker had never fused with resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings before. He had only ever fused with a hostility-level one, which was the weakest level. But he gathered the fusion method should be the same.</p>

  <p>"Do you like this?" Decker asked the hedgehog, summoning up all his courage.</p>

  <p>Cary rubbed against the glazed sheet and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then you can integrate yourself into it,"</p>

  <p>Decker encouraged.</p>

  <p>He offered the glazed sheet carefully, luring Cary into it.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were quite special.</p>

  <p>They could be solid enough to resist any attack, but they could also turn into the softest form in the world, compressing themselves into the size of a palm.</p>

  <p>Cary purred.</p>

  <p>He was quite obedient.</p>

  <p>His body turned liquid-like and quickly flowed into the glazed sheet.</p>
