</p>

  <p>Yazid hadn't used his full strength.</p>

  <p>Being a top-rank True God, half of the Six-Burden Divine City would be destroyed if he used all his strength.</p>

  <p>Even so, it was unfair to Luo Zheng. The Five Elements Destructing theurgy, which was used by Yazid, was not suitable for the test of a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>Unable to stand it anymore, Malloy shouted at them. "The test is too much for you to handle, Tianxing! You need to give up! The Floating Island will send people to recruit young geniuses next year. I am sure that you will be able to enter the Floating Island by that time!"</p>

  <p>The geniuses that had been recommended particularly by the sub-branches of the Han Clan were brought to the Floating Island by Yazid.</p>

  <p>As it was designed for a person only this time, Yazid did not care to take the test seriously. He had made the evaluation based on his own knowledge and preferences. However, next year, the test for the geniuses selected would be different than this one now. They were to be chosen with strict standards before they could enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Malloy knew that the test the Han Clan on the Floating Island had one perform was very strict and difficult, but understood that it was much easier than Yazid's. If the True God did not want Luo Zheng to pass, than Luo Zheng would never accomplish this task. It was practically impossible for Luo Zheng to resist the Five Elements Destructing theurgy for even five minutes.</p>

  <p>Yazid had to be entirely shameless to scheme up something like this!</p>

  <p>If he ever had the chance to go to the Floating Island in the future, Bentley decided that he would report Yazid to the Han Clan on the Floating Island. His schemes would surely anger them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng did not follow Malloy's advice. He did not want to let this hard won opportunity to go to waste, and tried his hand at this challenge for five minutes at the least.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sound of the earth cracking, metal colliding, and fire roaring echoed all around them. The sound was nearly overwhelming to Luo Zheng as it seemed to surround him.</p>

  <p>This power was proving to be terribly destructive.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew Yazid had been holding back, saving his strength. He knew that the True God was much more powerful than himself. Although the chaotic power didn't look violent, it still ripped into Zheng's skin like a knife.</p>

  <p>Attempting to avoid the brutal power, Luo Zheng was using several different methods including the Eight Smoky Melodies. It seemed to do no good as he could not get away from it all. This method had proved effective for him against proving godly warriors, and even some low-rank True Gods; however, facing a top-rank True God was no simple task.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could do nothing but grit his teeth and try to withstand the onslaught.</p>

  <p>Yazid easily masked the astonishment he felt at Zheng's performance behind a calm facade.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, he had no intention of using this destructive power. He had only planned to use the power of the five elements to defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Very quickly though, Yazid realized that just the five elements wouldn't be enough to harm Luo Zheng, so he had decided to activate this destructive power.</p>

  <p>He had expected Luo Zheng to crumble and beg for mercy under the power within a few seconds. However, Luo Zheng had performed beyond his expectations, and had withstood it head-on.</p>

  <p>A half-minute went by, and Luo Zheng had still not been severely injured. Yazid couldn't help but wonder how a proving godly warrior could have such a resilient body.</p>

  <p>Yazid hesitated as he debated using more strength.</p>

  <p>His moral scruples seemed to be what were holding him back. As a top-rank True God, it was already too much for him to use more than ten percent of his strength to assess a proving godly warrior. If he were to continue on this way using the Five Elements Destructing theurgy, he would only bring shame on himself.</p>

  <p>Yazid pushed his worry to the back of his mind. He had full confidence that Luo Zheng would not last a full five minutes.</p>

  <p>The more violently the five elements tangled, the more the destructive power increased. It was becoming more and more difficult for Luo Zheng to withstand the power.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was in a difficult position. The destructive power continued to cut at him, and there were more and more fissures appearing on his body. Even if he could withstand it, his body would end up severely damaged.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what to do. Bentley had already given Luo Zheng another choice. The worst thing would be to give up and wait for the next year to come. It didn't truly matter that much to wait for a year.</p>

  <p>Thinking about Yazid's contemptuous look had Luo Zheng gritting his teeth so hard that they squeaked.</p>

  <p>The wind picked up and circled around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The destructive power cut at Zheng's legs, and through the Redemption Armor. He grunted as it sliced deeply into his thighs and shins, golden blood spurting from the wounds.</p>

  <p>As the golden blood streamed down his legs, it attracted the attention of some of those in the Han Clan. Even though individuals with golden blood were not particularly rare in the divine land, it still surprised several of them. Despite their surprise, they did not take the revelation seriously.</p>

  <p>"You need to give up," Yazid said with a faint sneer. "The destructive power is not something you can withstand much longer. What if it breaks into your mind and destroys your soul? You don't want to die, do you?"</p>

  <p>Despite Yazid's warning, Luo Zheng did not allow his facial expression to change. He remained motionless.</p>

  <p>Master Evil sighed heavily while inside Zheng's mind. He could feel how stubborn this man was. Once he decided on something, Luo Zheng would allow no one to change his mind no matter how hard they attempted to persuade him. Malloy had tried to persuade Luo Zheng out of good will, whereas Yazid had tried with sarcasm. Of course, Yazid did not intend to take his life, but Luo Zheng did not know that. He simply turned a deaf ear to the both of them.</p>

  <p>While allowing his body to be battered and sliced apart, Luo Zheng focused on the Infinity Ruler in his mind.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler could only be activated by internal momentum, otherwise it simply floated quietly in Zheng's mind. It looked ordinary with no special characteristics.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Godly Way had been recorded in the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could use several theurgies of the Five Elements Godly Way through it. However, the Five Elements Destructing theurgy, which was a skill that Yazid had created by himself, was similar to Holy Jay's Ice Soul Flame. Even the Godly Way Tablet of the Five Elements Godly Way couldn't record such a skill.</p>

  <p>Would the Infinity Ruler be able to absorb the power of this theurgy?</p>

  <p>A bold idea came to Luo Zheng suddenly. Should he allow some of the internal momentum to dash into his mind, and let the Infinity Ruler absorb it?</p>

  <p>While facing a Godly Way Tablet, Luo Zheng should be able to withstand the internal momentum of it.</p>

  <p>After all, the Godly Way Tablet didn't have an owner, and it could only release the internal momentum automatically. Yazid was not a Godly Way Tablet without the ability to think, so if he attempted this it would come at a high risk.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not have much time to consider his decision, so he didn't bother to think it through. He began to introduce the internal momentum into his mind.</p>

  <p>When a theurgy of a Godly Way was performed, it would release the invisible power of internal momentum. The Five Elements Destructing theurgy was no exception! Luo Zheng would bear a considerable risk if he wanted to allow the internal momentum into his mind. After all, his cinnabar field and his mind were the two most important parts of his body.</p>

  <p>In stunned silence, Yazid watched as Luo Zheng gave up the protection over his mind and attempted to approach the destructive power. He had just told Luo Zheng to be careful and mind his soul so it wouldn't be damaged, but this fellow was going to take the attack head on. He had never seen such a crazy person before. Yazid didn't think Luo Zheng was trying to provoke him in any way.</p>

  <p>The others in the main hall exchanged glances with each other, completely confused about what on earth Luo Zheng was trying to do. He was simply courting death!</p>

  <p>The power of the five elements continued to collide with each other, and the destructive power would burst out each time the power of two mutually exclusive laws collided with each other. The destructive power was like an invisible blade, circling around Luo Zheng. If Yazid deliberately controlled the destructing power to kill Luo Zheng, he had no natural ability to resist it at all.</p>

  <p>However, Yazid did not see Luo Zheng as a real opponent after all. He had only used the Five Elements Destructing theurgy as a test, which had given Luo Zheng the chance to carry out his plan!</p>

  <p>The internal momentum that leaked out from the destructive power was slowly slithering into Zheng's mind. It proved to be incredibly powerful, and Master Evil's soul had already hidden away from it. Luo Zheng also hid his own soul deep in his mind as a precaution. If he wasn't paying close attention he would lose his soul, and that would not be fun.</p>

  <p>But the Infinity Ruler still continued to float in his mind quietly and did not respond.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wondered if he had guessed wrong. Maybe the amount of the internal momentum was still insufficient.</p>

  <p>Even with the great risks he had taken, the Infinity Rule remained motionless. It made Luo Zheng feel anxious.</p>

  <p>Smack!</p>

  <p>The destructive power slapped Luo Zheng in the forehead. He felt the skin open up on his forehead, and a warm gush of blood dribbled down his face.</p>

  <p>Shouts of horror and shock filled the main hall at the gruesome sight.</p>

  <p>Even Yazid was equally panicked. It was true that he did not intend to let Luo Zheng pass his test, but if he killed Luo Zheng by mistake things would not go very well for him. Despite the fact Luo Zheng brought it upon himself, the responsibility would still fall on him.</p>

  <p>"Stop, Yazid!" Bentley shouted, a harsh look on his face. At the same moment, the internal momentum in his body was being slowly released.</p>

  <p>He couldn't watch Luo Zheng die in the Heavenly Han House. He had failed to persuade Luo Zheng to give up, but he could at least stop Yazid. Moreover, he had long wanted to have a fight with Yazid.</p>

  <p>"He brought this upon himself,"</p>

  <p>Yazid explained hurriedly when he saw that Bentley was preparing his attack. Although both of them were top-rank True Gods, Bentley was much stronger than him. If Bentley really fought him out of anger, he was bound to suffer.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter what's the reason, you must stop," Bentley ordered. His tone brooked no room for an argument. He looked as if he were ready to attack at any moment.</p>

  <p>If the two top-rank True Gods fought in the Heavenly Han House, it would undoubtedly be a massive event. So Malloy and the others all stepped out to mediate.</p>

  <p>Just as the main hall erupted into chaos, two circles of golden light suddenly appeared in Zheng's pupils.</p>
