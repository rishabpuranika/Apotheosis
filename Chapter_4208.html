<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The terrifying power of the light ball left everyone shaken.</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters had always been arrogant. They were convinced that the Bird Spirit King Sheehan was the most powerful being in the Four Spirits Sect. After all, he had taken much of the credit for the rapid development of the Four Spirits Sect in the past.</p>

  <p>But now they weren't so sure as they felt the destructive energy the Monkey Spirit King emanated.</p>

  <p>Duran shot a concerned look at Lawler and transmitted a question secretly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think our king would win if he were here?"</p>

  <p>"But he hasn't awakened." Lawler shot back.</p>

  <p>"But what if he were awake?" Duran pressed.</p>

  <p>"He would not win," Lawler replied with conviction.</p>

  <p>Duran fell silent, struggling with his thoughts.</p>

  <p>'Since we have sworn our unwavering loyalty to the Bird Spirit King, we have to make enemies with other forces.</p>

  <p>We're working with the Monkey Spirit Sect now, but we would probably go back to being in conflict with them in the future.</p>

  <p>When that time comes, how can we possibly match up to the Monkey Spirit King?' Duran thought worriedly.</p>

  <p>Lawler, however, sensed what was on Duran's mind. "Luo Zheng is looking for the Human Spirit King. If Luo Zheng can find him, the Human Spirit King might be able to save our king. Don't fret too much. There can be peace in the future," Lawler assured him.</p>

  <p>Lawler kept his next thoughts to himself. 'Anything can happen. All we can do is wait.'</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were completely oblivious to the conversation between the two Bird Masters.</p>

  <p>All their attention was fixed on the huge light ball in the distance.</p>

  <p>The light ball continued to glow for a while before it began to dim and gradually dissipate.</p>

  <p>The massive body of the Monkey Spirit King came into view. There was no sign of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"We won!"</p>

  <p>"Our king is invincible!"</p>

  <p>"That stupid snake was killed again. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Manuel, Tearrag and Hagar started shouting, whooping excitedly.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess shot them an exasperated look that clearly conveyed she thought they were idiots. "Where did that space ball go?" she asked as she turned to her companions.</p>

  <p>"It appears to be gone," Fuxi replied, scanning his surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Has it been destroyed? So the Snake Spirit King was killed just like that?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"That snake was giving himself too much credit. It might never have occurred to him that the Monkey Spirit King could be this strong,"</p>

  <p>Gonggong pointed out.</p>

  <p>The ball had contained the Snake Spirit King's coordinates. If the ball had been destroyed, the coordinates likely had been, too. If that were the case, the Snake Spirit King wouldn't be able to come back from the dead. Once a Treacherous Being's coordinates were destroyed, it would mean final, eternal death for them. The Snake Spirit King would be no exception.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the Monkey Spirit King is all right. He's not moving," the Snake Goddess said, arching her eyebrows at his figure in the distance.</p>

  <p>'These Monkey Masters aren't even astute enough to worry about their king, ' she thought huffily.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before more people began to suspect something amiss with the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>He had remained still since he took out the Snake Spirit King, looking exhausted.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, cracks began to appear on his tough body, countless white fragments flaking off.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty! Are you all right?" Manuel shouted as he bolted toward the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>It finally occurred to Manuel something was wrong.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King shattered into pieces and evaporated before Manuel could even reach him.</p>

  <p>When the Monkey Spirit King released the overwhelming energy, the Light of Annihilation had enveloped him and the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Neither could survive that.</p>

  <p>In the next second, the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates on the altar emitted golden lights.</p>

  <p>A massive foot came out, followed by another, followed by legs, a torso, arms, and head. It wasn't long before the Monkey Spirit King had emerged fully again.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty!"</p>

  <p>"It's our king!"</p>

  <p>"Our king came back!"</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters roared in celebration again.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had just won a big victory.</p>

  <p>With the Snake Spirit King dead, there was nothing else that could be a threat to them.</p>

  <p>This also came as a relief to the human spirits and the Bird Masters.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Spirit King's coordinates have been destroyed, so he won't resurrect."</p>

  <p>"So this is the end of the war? We won?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we won. Our king is invincible. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>But while the Monkey Masters cheered, something began to go awry with the Monkey Spirit King again.</p>

  <p>Black cracks started appearing again on the Monkey Spirit King, crawling all over his body and causing white fragments to flake off him until they were scattered all over the altar.</p>

  <p>The fragments soon dissipated into nothing again.</p>

  <p>The newly revived Monkey Spirit King had just died again. The Monkey Masters were dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"What is happening to our king?" Hagar exclaimed, panic starting to overcome him.</p>

  <p>Manuel stepped up to the altar and looked closer at the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates. "Our king just came back to life. No one attacked him, so why did he perish again?" Manuel murmured in confusion, thinking aloud.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess and the others soon joined him in inspecting the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates.</p>

  <p>They had met lots of Treacherous Beings over the years, but they had never seen such a strange phenomenon before.</p>

  <p>Before long, the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates began glowing again.</p>

  <p>His huge body once again emerged from the coordinates.</p>

  <p>A pained expression lined the face of the resurrected Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>He opened his mouth to say something, but before any words could leave his lips, he broke into pieces and disappeared into thin air again.</p>

  <p>Treacherous Beings could resurrect endlessly while their coordinates remained intact. But if they died too many times in a short period, it took them longer and longer to come back.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched in helpless bewilderment as the Monkey Spirit King came back to life once more.</p>

  <p>It was his third resurrection, but just like before, he didn't even have the time to say anything before he vanished.</p>

  <p>After that, he resurrected and died a fourth time.</p>

  <p>And then a fifth time.</p>

  <p>After the Monkey Spirit King's fifth death, the light that his coordinates emitted began to dim.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was incredibly strong, but after the successive resurrections, it would take some time for his coordinates to accumulate enough energy to bring him back to life again.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?"</p>

  <p>"This is insane!"</p>

  <p>Manuel and Tearrag were in distress. The other Monkey Masters were likewise stumped. Their race weren't known for intelligence, so this was quite an insurmountable problem for them.</p>

  <p>"This isn't good," the Snake Goddess warned, her eyes trained on something in the distance.</p>

  <p>The snake spirits and the Snake Masters had just revived and were starting to swarm back toward them.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven snorted. "They're nothing without the Snake Spirit King."</p>

  <p>They still had the Bird Masters, the Monkey Masters and the human spirits on their side. They could easily defeat the Snake Spirit King's subordinates.</p>

  <p>As soon as Manuel, Tearrag and Hagar caught sight of the snake spirits, they started snarling ferociously. They had no idea what had happened to the Monkey Spirit King, but they knew the Snake Spirit King was responsible for it. They were raring to vent their anger on the members of the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"I'm not talking about them."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess shook her head and pointed at the sky.</p>

  <p>A black light had appeared out of nowhere, like a shadow in the sky.</p>

  <p>The black light was exactly where the ball had been before.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven furrowed his brows as he watched it grow.</p>

  <p>His eyes soon widened in horror.</p>

  <p>The black light gradually expanded, revealing the ball within it. The Snake Spirit King's massive coordinates remained intact inside the ball.</p>

  <p>A thick tongue slithered out of the coordinates, followed by the Snake Spirit King's head and body.</p>

  <p>All the creatures on the altar were rendered paralyzed at the sight of the Snake Spirit King's resurrection.</p>
