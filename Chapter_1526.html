  <p>
</p>

  <p>The smile on Luo Zheng's face was undoubtedly quite annoying in Layne's eyes.</p>

  <p>Humans were considered a most formidable race in the universe, but in this main city, ogres were in the majority!</p>

  <p>The other races were all unintentionally assigned to the main city, but these warriors were nothing more than cannon fodder.</p>

  <p>Now that Layne was standing here, the tens of thousands of martial artists in the main city didn't dare to take even a single step? Was this human youth strutting around before his eyes an idiot?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's smile became rather confusing at this moment.</p>

  <p>Layne didn't know that, although he was one of the raiders in the city, he was nothing but a fat sheep in Luo Zheng's eyes. At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng fretted that Layne would return to the main city.</p>

  <p>Already, Layne had accumulated 200, 000 Illusion Points. Even if Luo Luo Zheng could get half of that number, that would be 100, 000 Illusion Points; while, Luo Luo Zheng currently only had a total of over 70, 000 Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>"Where did this human warrior come from? He actually went straight at Layne?"</p>

  <p>"Does he want to die?"</p>

  <p>"I know this guy. Previously, he killed Ezra in the southwest! He's a powerful warrior! He shattered Ezra's axes with his bare hands! They were a secondary first-rank divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>Secondary first-rank divine weapons were as nothing in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>However, in the eyes of the many warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, they were treasures which could only be found by luck.</p>

  <p>"Is this guy really that strong?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing these words, the city's ogre martial artists' eyes all looked at Luo Luo Zheng with new respect.</p>

  <p>"Even so, he's not a match for Layne. They? They will never be in the same league in terms of strength. Layne has already comprehended some profound mysteries within the Fire Law, and has made them his own to use. This boy actually dared to take the initiative to provoke Layne. Does he think that he has collected too many Illusion Points to lose?"</p>

  <p>As they discussed this event, a small number of the human martial artists' eyes began to shine with a bright light!</p>

  <p>These human warriors had been unilaterally assigned to the main city, and could only accept their unlucky fate. The difference of races didn't matter in the Illusion Battlefield, and only their strength mattered. These ogre warriors would even kill each other in squabbles between themselves. However, as long as the small number of human warriors left the main city, they would all be immediately targeted.</p>

  <p>It was because, firstly, the human warriors in the main city were indeed a bit weaker. Secondly, they were of a different race; and thus, they were more vulnerable to attacks.</p>

  <p>Hearing that this human youth in front of them had actually displayed such strength, they also began to feel a bit proud, and it could be said that watching Luo Zheng's combat had actually helped them vent their pent-up anger.</p>

  <p>However, having witnessed the battle that Layne had fought just now, they couldn't help but worry for Luo Luo Zheng. After all, the strength displayed by Layne was too terrifying to underestimate. The young human warrior in front of them might be strong, but he was no match for Layne.</p>

  <p>More and more warriors began to gather on the city wall.</p>

  <p>They also wanted to see what this human youth had that made him dare to challenge Layne like this.</p>

  <p>Outside the city walls, the two warriors' gazes were locked onto each other. They were both concerned that the other party would be too afraid to fight and might escape into the city!</p>

  <p>However, as the distance between the two continued to close, both sides realized that their worries were unfounded!</p>

  <p>They could see the strong self-confidence present in each other's eyes.</p>

  <p>This self-confidence was not something that could be pretended. It was accumulated and defined over and over again through arduous battles, and had seeped into their very bones. It was not in their natures to run.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where your confidence comes from," Layne said indifferently when the distance between the two was only one hundred feet. He stared at Luo Luo Zheng with a hint of ridicule in his eyes. "However, you will soon understand what despair is? You should be glad that this is the Illusion Battlefield, for at least you won't die for real."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was calm as he said with a smile, "You can choose to believe that I have overestimated myself."</p>

  <p>A brilliant light flashed in Layne's eyes, and his majestic Mu Ning was suddenly released. The Mu Ning contained his comprehension of the Fire Law, so even though it was just an Mu Ning, it radiated an abnormal scorching heat. Standing in front of Layne was like standing in front of a blazing furnace!</p>

  <p>"An interesting human warrior..."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, Layne suddenly raised his hand and a ball of purple flames appeared on his palm. He squeezed lightly and the ball of fire was suddenly extinguished.</p>

  <p>At the same time as the purple flames were extinguished, great balls of the purple fire appeared within a radius of one thousand feet around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Layne smiled faintly, and the moment he took a step forward, blazing flames suddenly erupted from his back. These flames split into two massive purple wings, like a great hawk spreading its wings, and he then pounced towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Facing Layne's attack, Luo Luo Zheng briefly looked flustered and quickly moved to dodge. In the eyes of the crowd, he seemed to want to avoid Layne's flames, but they could see that Luo Luo Zheng had no chance of avoiding them as his speed and the direction he chose to flee made him doomed to suffer.</p>

  <p>As Layne's punch landed on Luo Zheng's body, a ball of purple flames several feet in diameter exploded outward!</p>

  <p>From the purple flames, a figure shot out like an arrow, and crashed into the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A deafening roar could be heard as the figure smashed a huge crater into the ground.</p>

  <p>When the purple flames dissipated, the figure of Layne was still seen floating in the air. The one who had been smashed down was Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Huh, I thought this human martial artist had some skills. It seems that he is even far inferior to Wallis!"</p>

  <p>"He has been defeated with a single punch, and Layne hasn't even used his profound mysteries of the Fire Law yet?"</p>

  <p>"He could not withstand even a single blow. So lame!"</p>

  <p>Layne didn't push the attack on him. He looked down at the large crater with a mocking smile, but a trace of doubt arose in his mind.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, talented martial artists would have developed a sensitive intuition. They were able to judge the strength of their opponent from their confidence, bearing, and expression. This sort of judgment wasn't always absolutely right, but it was usually very close to the fact.</p>

  <p>Although Layne looked down on his fallen opponent, Luo Zheng's indifferent expression created a faint sense of pressure and unease in Layne.</p>

  <p>On the surface, he had been mocking Luo Luo Zheng with his words. He was only belittling him strategically, but he did not underestimate Luo Luo Zheng in the slightest when he had employed his tactics. So when he had attacked Luo Luo Zheng just now, he had not held back at all!</p>

  <p>This move, 'Soaring Phoenix Flaming Dragon' seemed to have been nothing special, but its power was extraordinary?</p>

  <p>It looked like the results were quite spectacular. At least, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't been able to dodge this move. But Layne faintly felt that something wasn't quite right.</p>

  <p>Maybe he was just being oversensitive?</p>

  <p>Layne indifferently glanced back at the human martial artist below. At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng had already climbed out of the huge crater, and was looking at Layne with a grim expression. There was an unyielding look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, don't look at me like that." Layne's body swayed slightly, and those two wings of purple flames spread out on his back once again.</p>

  <p>"You must have accumulated a lot of Illusion Points? But to me, you're just a sheep, and I'm a wolf?"</p>

  <p>As he said that, his figure flashed once again, leaving a path of flames in his wake.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng calmly looked at Layne, who was rapidly approaching him, there was a sly twinkle deep in his eyes?</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult for him to gather enough Illusion Points. It was just that the rules set for this Illusion Battlefield had not worked to his advantage. However, if he were to win this round, he could indeed take away half of Layne's Illusion Points. But if Layne really lost to him, then he would probably choose to hide in the city and never come out!</p>

  <p>The Illusion Points which Layne had were quite a lot. Luo Luo Zheng had to convince Layne that he wouldn't admit defeat.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body shook once again, as if he was trying his best to avoid Layne's attack, but this time, he still failed!</p>

  <p>As a ball of purple flames exploded, Luo Zheng's figure once again flew outward and heavily collided with the city wall?</p>

  <p>This city wall had been constructed according to the rules of the Illusion Battlefield, so it was naturally indestructible. Even such a violent collision was unable to destroy the city wall, and as a result Luo Luo Zheng was left hanging on the surface of the wall like a macabre decoration.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng's physical body was as sturdy as a divine weapon, once his body hit the city wall, without any protecting buffer, the blood in his body still boiled. Luo Luo Zheng had to carry out his plan, so he chose to tolerate this.</p>

  <p>"He's not dead yet? He does seem to have some special abilities?"</p>

  <p>Layne sighed heavily. He had originally thought that Luo Luo Zheng would immediately bump into the city wall and end his life. However, this fellow's physical body was so toughened that it should be considered a rare natural gift. But a purely strong physical body was of no use at all. It was only a target which made him end up being beaten by his opponent.</p>

  <p>Without thinking too much, Layne once again charged at Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom?"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was repeatedly thrown to the wall, the warriors on the city wall were amazed by what their eyes were seeing.</p>

  <p>Wasn't it too tragic for Luo Luo Zheng to become a live target?</p>

  <p>However, just at the moment that Layne was about to charge towards Luo Luo Zheng again, an imperceptible smile formed on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>'It's about time...' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>
