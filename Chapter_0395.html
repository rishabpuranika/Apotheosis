<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 395 A Serious Matter (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Only a small number of people had bet on Luo Luo Zheng. They had hoped that a newcomer would be able to prove himself during the competition.</p>

  <p>Considering Luo Zheng's performance, it was their turn to gloat. "I knew that Luo Luo Zheng would have a trump card up his sleeve! Although he is only at the second-grade of the nature level, he has prevailed in all the fights. He is a capable man!"</p>

  <p>Kenneth, who sat on the terrace high above the arena, was shocked when he saw the demonic life vitality gathering on Luo Zheng's hands. He studied the demonic life vitality? his eyes as sharp as two knives. Then he muttered slowly, "What just happened? If I see correctly, the life vitality in Luo Zheng's hands is demonic life vitality!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xu, who was beside Kenneth, was also surprised. His face grew solemn. "Yes, it is indeed demonic life vitality! This guy mastered demonic life vitality. But how... How did he enter the Heavenly Library and obtain the Heavenly Ogre Fist?"</p>

  <p>"Haha, the Heavenly Ogre Fist had been in the Heavenly Library for hundreds of years. Over the years, only three people have been able to get it before Luo Luo Zheng. Two of them failed to master the Heavenly Ogre Fist, and the third was stopped by Uncle Kent who forbade him from practicing it. I never expected... that there could be someone who would master the Heavenly Ogre Fist," Kenneth said in surprise.</p>

  <p>Uncle Kent, as mentioned by Kenneth, was the elderly man Luo Luo Zheng had met when he took the Heavenly Ogre Fist from the Heavenly Library. Kent was a man of high standing, and so, Kenneth had to pay respect by calling him Uncle Kent.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Ogre Fist is a tier-5 cultivation method. It has been said that it is impossible for humans to master it. I have no idea how this guy managed to do so." Elder Xu seemed envious. Even though he was a respectable elder, he had a keen desire to master the Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>It was not that Xu did not have access to the Heavenly Ogre Fist. If he had paid a certain price, he would have had the chance to borrow it.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Xu was getting old, and a tier-5 cultivation method was not easy to master. This method had been passed down from the ogres, and it was said that even the ogres had found it hard! Considering the circumstances, it would be an impossible task for Xu to master it.</p>

  <p>"Humans can't master it?" Hearing Xu's words, Kenneth shook his head and said, "It is indeed difficult for hundreds of millions of people spread across the three hundred counties of the Eastern Region. But look at the whole world? the various sects, palaces, and holy lands. Talented disciples have unlimited resources from the time they are born. They get their talent from their powerful parents. Thus they have great gifts at birth. If they really want to master it, they probably could..."</p>

  <p>Xu became silent upon hearing Kenneth's words.</p>

  <p>Kenneth was right. The world was indeed massive.</p>

  <p>The population in the Eastern Region had reached over a hundred million. Moreover, there were Western Region, Northern Region, Southern Region, and Central Region, and each of them was no smaller than the Eastern Region!</p>

  <p>While the human population was not inconsequential by any standards, the distance between regions was over millions of kilometers. Humans scattered within the boundary of their region fought to defend themselves. Even if the demons attacked one of the regions, humans from other areas were unable to help due to the great distance. Moreover, the other four regions might not be reigned by humans. To Xu's knowledge, the humans in the Western Region had a hard life, as the Ogres controlled them. There, the status of humans was less than that of the ogres, and they had to bend their knees to ogres.</p>

  <p>The ogres were widely distributed just like human clans. At the junction of the Central Region and the Eastern Region, there was a big ogre empire. Now, the Burning Sky Empire had allied with the ogres to fight against the demons.</p>

  <p>If one looked from a broader perspective, the five regions were only a massive island in the world.</p>

  <p>It was said that a person could only see the real continent after sailing across the boundless Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>With such a thought, looking back at Cloud Sect and imagining that there were trillions of creatures in this world, Xu wondered how difficult it would be for the most gifted disciple to master the Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>"I feel ashamed. As the head of the sect, I wasn't informed that someone in Cloud Sect had mastered the Heavenly Ogre Fist until I saw it myself.</p>

  <p>Haha!"</p>

  <p>In fact, quite a few people in Cloud Sect knew that Luo Luo Zheng had mastered the cultivation method. It was certain that the ten great saints knew about it.</p>

  <p>But for some unknown reason, they chose not to report this to the leader.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they blocked a lot of news about Luo Luo Zheng that showed his great talents during his practice.</p>

  <p>"Your grace, few people can recognize the Heavenly Ogre Fist. I'm afraid that even if Luo Luo Zheng showcases the skill in public, no one will be able to recognize it," Xu analyzed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right. But I will investigate this matter. If someone has been intentionally hiding this information despite knowing it is a serious matter, I will make them pay!" Kenneth said calmly.</p>

  <p>Xu was astonished by Kenneth's vow. Although it had nothing to do with him, he could sense the intention to kill in Kenneth's words. Shivers traveled down Xu's spine. He had thought that this accomplishment would highlight Luo Zheng's potential. He didn't expect that Kenneth would attach such great importance to this matter. 'Is it really so difficult to master this tier-5 cultivation method?' He wondered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, of course, couldn't hear their conversation. Luo Zheng's knowledge was only limited to the Eastern Region. He had no idea what was behind the Heavenly Ogre Fist. He just happened to have chosen this technique to break Dick's defense.</p>
