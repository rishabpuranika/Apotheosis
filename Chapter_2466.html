<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to the words on the cyan stone tablet, the inheritance would go to the warrior whose name was inscribed at the top of the tablet. Only the most excellent would be rewarded.</p>

  <p>And there was no set limit to prove that one was excellent.</p>

  <p>The higher the position of the inscription, the better.</p>

  <p>Although Wesley was not very old, he was still a rare talent in the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>After breaking through four hundred feet, he did not abruptly leave his name, but continued to rush upward.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Goodwill and Malice is really powerful," Wesley said excitedly. "But our Dongfang Clan's skill is also good!"</p>

  <p>Besides the Truth of Godly Way, Wesley activated a secret cultivation method, causing a vast force to burst out of his body.</p>

  <p>It was this force that made him accelerate into the sky.</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Six hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Seven hundred feet...</p>

  <p>When he broke through seven hundred feet in the air and raised his head, he was able to see the top of the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>The entire cyan stone tablet looked to be about a thousand feet in height.</p>

  <p>If he managed to leave his name at the height of a thousand feet, he would definitely be able to obtain the inheritance.</p>

  <p>But after crossing seven hundred feet, he felt the space around him become viscous, as if he was flying through thick, heavy oil, instead of air, and he felt like he was being dragged down by countless hands.</p>

  <p>"I've reached the limit..."</p>

  <p>Seven hundred and twenty feet.</p>

  <p>A small snake-like knife appeared in Wesley's hand.</p>

  <p>The knife hurtled toward the tablet, followed by a few crisp sounds.</p>

  <p>To Wesley's surprise, the material of the cyan stone tablet was soft. It was not hard at all to carve his name into it.</p>

  <p>Soon, a few letters appeared on the cyan stone tablet, spelling out "Wesley."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as his name was inscribed, Wesley fell and landed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Looking up at his name on the tablet, Wesley smiled and said, "Duke, it's not that hard to carve words on the tablet."</p>

  <p>Duke nodded excitedly.</p>

  <p>The True Gods had originally been worried that it would be extremely difficult to carve words on the stone tablet, but Wesley's words dispelled their misgivings.</p>

  <p>Now, all of them were eager to try their hand at getting the inheritance.</p>

  <p>Many had come to the debate venue before and gone home with empty hands.</p>

  <p>Moreover, most of them had gone through all kinds of hardships and almost lost their lives.</p>

  <p>Anyone who reached this point alive was either powerful or extremely lucky.</p>

  <p>Now that this great chance had appeared for them, they all wanted to make the most of it.</p>

  <p>After all, they were all only one step away from obtaining the inheritance in the debate venue. For countless years, no one else had come even close to this point.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard was losing his patience.</p>

  <p>Although Marsh had given the order that the Luo siblings were to be the biggest protagonists in the debate venue, who wouldn't want to be the master of the world?</p>

  <p>Being from the Sword Clan, Reinhard believed that his clan would want him to gain the inheritance of the debate venue regardless of Marsh's orders.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was clear that he didn't have much hope, but he didn't want to give up without even trying.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed with a bright light. Then, the next moment, he lifted the long sword in his hand and shot upward.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He pierced through the air like a sharp arrow.</p>

  <p>"Well done!"</p>

  <p>"Reinhard! Bro! Go for it!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Sword Clan looked up at Reinhard in admiration.</p>

  <p>After all, Reinhard was the central figure of their group.</p>

  <p>And by the looks of it, he was twice as fast as Wesley.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had reached a height of four hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the facial expressions of Duke, Wesley, Tyrone, and Ellis darkened slightly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone was secretly calculating their next move.</p>

  <p>Also, they were hoping that Reinhard wouldn't be able to beat Wesley's record.</p>

  <p>However, Reinhard became even more determined after breaking through four hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He continued to rise up, but now, he traveled at a stable speed that was neither fast nor slow.</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet, six hundred feet, seven hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Just like Wesley, Reinhard slowed down after breaking through seven hundred feet.</p>

  <p>"What a strong pressure!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard gritted his teeth and his face became extremely twisted.</p>

  <p>He held the long sword in his hand and bit his lips hard.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>With that yell, a sharp force burst out from his body.</p>

  <p>It was the Sword Clan's Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>In terms of the comprehension of the Truth of Godly Way, Reinhard was especially outstanding. In fact, even some of the consummate True Gods in the Sword Clan were inferior to him.</p>

  <p>When he activated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, it looked to everyone like he had lost his vitality.</p>

  <p>It gave them the strange illusion that he was not a flesh and blood body anymore, but a sword.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng watched Reinhard with great interest.</p>

  <p>In order to activate the Emotion Closing Godly Way fully, Zheng had cultivated to the state of Ripping Consciousness.</p>

  <p>But Ripping Consciousness did not completely eliminate his consciousness.</p>

  <p>Reinhard, on the other hand, seemed to have somehow turned himself into a cold weapon.</p>

  <p>"It is no wonder that he's so angry when talking about the Emotion Closing Godly Way. If he merges the Emotion Closing Godly Way with his own cultivation method, it will immediately be brought to a terrifying level..."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After activating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, Reinhard rushed upward again.</p>

  <p>Seven hundred and twenty feet...</p>

  <p>Seven hundred and thirty feet...</p>

  <p>Seven hundred and forty feet...</p>

  <p>Seeing Reinhard surpassing him, Wesley's face darkened and his eyes gleamed with killing intent.</p>

  <p>Now that he had been surpassed, it meant that he had no chance of getting the inheritance.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan cheered. Although Reinhard was superior to just two of the True Gods present, the height he had reached said otherwise. What was more, he didn't seem to have any intention of slowing down.</p>

  <p>"It's not enough!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>Faint traces of sword textures appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>All the momentum in his inner world surged madly like a flood.</p>

  <p>"Flaming sword!"</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The blood-red sword textures on his face seemed to be burnt, and he shot up with newfound energy.</p>

  <p>Seven hundred and eighty feet...</p>

  <p>Seven hundred and ninety feet...</p>

  <p>Eight hundred feet!</p>

  <p>At this point, Reinhard turned over in the air, and the sword in his hand vibrated to form a beautiful shape.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The long sword sparked against the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>The word "Reinhard" was carved on the stone tablet and then he fell down.</p>

  <p>His name was inscribed eighty feet higher than Wesley's.</p>

  <p>Even though Wesley was annoyed, he had no objections. After all, he knew the difficulty of surpassing any distance above seven hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was indeed stronger than him.</p>

  <p>As the skeleton in the well stared at the scene on the wall, a glimmer of light flashed in his hollow eyes.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that there would be such a talent among the younger generation of the Sword Clan. He left his name at eight hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Very good!"</p>

  <p>Being adjacent to the Sword Clan, the skeleton had witnessed the early growth of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>During that period, he had even silently given some help to the Sword Clan through the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>It was just that he had never thought of leaving his inheritance to this clan.</p>
