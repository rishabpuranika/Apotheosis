<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the Snake Goddess walked out of the cocoon, another cocoon broke open as well. Fuxi emerged and nimbly walked out of it.</p>

  <p>Now, he looked exactly like an ordinary human man.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's eyes, the Snake Goddess race was not a human race, and they were simply related to the humans.</p>

  <p>So, why did the Snake Goddess descend with those white spots?</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that it might be too impolite of him if he asked her about it directly, so he swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue.</p>

  <p>"Fuxi and I had many memories after we came to this world. We knew how to make pottery ware, weave webs, catch fishes..." the Snake Goddess continued.</p>

  <p>In time, the humans began to flourish rapidly around that small mountain.</p>

  <p>The memories in their minds had made a crucial contribution to the fact that they could master these skills in a short time.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought of something? For example, the Lord of Weapons..." the Snake Goddess reminded. At that moment, Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Chiyou was known as the Lord of Weapons, because he invented the sword, spear, halberd, armor, crossbow…</p>

  <p>"These inventions..." said Zheng hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"They are the memories given by the humans on the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess explained. What King Manard had said was verified with the evolution of illusions.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, it was very difficult for the races that had entered the Other Shore to return to the chaos.</p>

  <p>If the humans had appeared in the chaos, it meant that the humans on the Other Shore had already begun to take action.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and Chiyou were the seeds sowed by the humans on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"So, you, the Human Sovereign, and even my grandfather represent the humans on the Other Shore. Are you their spokespersons?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No. It's not that simple," replied the Snake Goddess as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>The humans on the Other Shore were well prepared, as they had given all the memories that the humans in the chaos should know. The only thing was, the humans in the chaos didn't know where they came from, what was their goal, or anything about the humans on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In any case, thanks to those memories, several human forces had advanced rapidly.</p>

  <p>For instance, the small Pear Hill which had descended in the very beginning had developed alongside the growth of the primitive land. When the primitive land became as large as it was today, the Pear Hill had expanded to the size of a big province.</p>

  <p>"The most mystical thing is," said the Snake Goddess with an ironic expression, "I know about the existence of the humans on the Other Shore, and I also know that they created us, but we still can't find them."</p>

  <p>Of course, not all races were the same.</p>

  <p>For example, after the Separate Abyss race had gotten increasingly stronger, they quickly found their home on the Other Shore, the Abyss Spirit race.</p>

  <p>The latter had even helped them take over the entire Stage Eleven.</p>

  <p>The human forces, including the Nine Li race, the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race, however, hadn't found their own home on the Other Shore yet.</p>

  <p>"Now you can tell me how you mastered the void construction and the Truth of Godly Way," the Snake Goddess requested while she waved her hand. The illusions in front of Zheng and Yan immediately collapsed and turned into a thick white mist.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "Can I ask another question?"</p>

  <p>"Please go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Since the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race also came from the human race on the Other Shore, why did they choose a different path?" he asked. The humans on the Other Shore had created the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Nine Li race, and the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Why were there conflicts between them in the end?</p>

  <p>The answer to his question was rather easy. The Snake Goddess thought for a while and then explained, "Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer have doubts about the existence of the humans on the Other Shore. Furthermore, the supreme masters of these two races have each become the spokespersons for other civilizations, and the civilizations that they represent have joined the Blood Assembly on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>You know, the Blood Assembly is a strong force, and they are also our enemy." "The Blood Assembly?" Zheng asked as his eyebrows shot up in curiosity.</p>

  <p>Back when he had tried to help Elvinia erase the memories of that pig-faced monster called Teague, Teague had mentioned the Blood Assembly before he was finally driven out from Elvinia's body.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Blood Assembly on the Other Shore had pushed those pig-faced monsters to Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>"It is a force formed by many races on the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess answered.</p>

  <p>Zheng just nodded once more. He now had a rough idea.</p>

  <p>The intricate and complex forces on the Other Shore were born in more than a thousand chaotic eras of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zheng still couldn't get any news about the human race on the Other Shore. They were so mysterious that even the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were unable to find them.</p>

  <p>After he had digested the information the Snake Goddess had given him, he said, "This is the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. It's connected with another Other Shore."</p>

  <p>"Another Other Shore? There is another Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>Even though the Snake Goddess had almost omnipotent wisdom, she was still shocked upon hearing what Zheng had said.</p>

  <p>As far as she knew, such a thing was impossible.</p>

  <p>Then again, she could sense the fluctuation in Zheng's consciousness.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't read it, she could easily tell that he wasn't lying.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Are the humans on the Other Shore hiding in that Other Shore?" At that point, the Snake Goddess had thought of the humans on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "There are only ten-odd people on that Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, they are not creatures of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In addition, they asked me to help look for the humans from the 77th civilization on our Other Shore," he explained. "But how did you go to that Other Shore?" the Snake Goddess asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yan stood by the side and quietly listened to her brother's words, her eyes wide with surprise. Not even the Human Sovereign could make the Snake Goddess look like that!</p>

  <p>"Back when I was in the Chaotic Source World, I had fought against Mount.</p>

  <p>He exiled me to that space," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"That is Othniel's truth-level theurgy. That space should belong to Othniel.</p>

  <p>How could it be another Other Shore?" the Snake Goddess asked again. The information Zheng was giving still perplexed her.</p>

  <p>She had already heard that Mount had exiled Zheng. She was originally a little curious as to how Zheng had returned, because all things considered, it was impossible for him to return after he was exiled.</p>

  <p>"There is a human in that space who said his name was King Manard. He came from the 77th civilization, and he has been hiding there until now. He has completely controlled that space and transformed it into another Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He taught me the Truth of Three-Energy Construction," Zheng stated.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, the Snake Goddess couldn't keep calm anymore.</p>

  <p>The 77th civilization had left a lot of traces in the Three Purities Stage on the Other Shore, but no one had ever met any of them.</p>

  <p>She never thought that Zheng would've found a human from the 77th civilization in that way! "Even if King Manard can live in that space, how did he find the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>The answer Zheng gave shocked her greatly once again. "He found it from outside of the chaos," he said.</p>
