<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A deeper frown appeared on Zheng's face when he heard Jago's complaint.</p>

  <p>Although only a small number of people outside the Dragon City could join the Oneness Guards and very few of them joined the major sword sects, they were still members of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>However, these people were sent to the North Unicorn Province, where they were used as bait.</p>

  <p>When Zheng learned of this matter, he too was enraged! "What if you don't obey their orders?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Those who disobey the military orders won't be able to escape death," Jago replied with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>Back then, Jago thought that he was lucky to enter the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had cultivated so hard in the Dragon City and had stepped into the Other Shore Realm in the past few years. Now, he was in the second stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>If he stayed in the Sword Light Palace, he wouldn't be able to make it even after thousands of years...</p>

  <p>However, he ended up in his current state after he became an Other Shore Realm warrior. If he stayed in the Sword Light Palace all the time, he might not be able to achieve anything in the future, but it would be a good thing to be a socialite or a playboy of the Yuebai Clan.</p>

  <p>Of course, Jago didn't mean to blame Zheng. They had looked forward to entering the Dragon City before, after all.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Sword Light Palace would have already been destroyed if Zheng had not come.</p>

  <p>A mischievous grin graced Zheng's face, and then he said, "Go up with me!"</p>

  <p>"Go up..." Jago's eyes glinted.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng invited him, the Other Shore Realm warriors on the lower tier immediately caused a ruckus.</p>

  <p>Those Other Shore Realm warriors and Jago shared the same fate. All of them would be sacrificed as bait, but to be fair, who was willing to accept that?</p>

  <p>"General, please take me with you!"</p>

  <p>"General, how about letting me be promoted to a Oneness Guard?"</p>

  <p>"Master Zheng, I've met you in the Dragon City. I..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Other Shore Realm warriors began to swarm Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, they were interrupted when several five-star Oneness Guards from the upper tier came down.</p>

  <p>"Go back right now!" one of the guards shouted.</p>

  <p>That particular Oneness Guard had a Soul of Light that was in Stage Twelve of the Other Shore and could soon turn into the Indigo Soul.</p>

  <p>The aura he emanated felt like a gentle breeze to Zheng, but it forced those warriors to retreat!</p>

  <p>Jago couldn't bear it at first, but Zheng pulled him to his side and blocked the aura. Fortunately, Jago was fine.</p>

  <p>"You... How dare you!" shouted Zheng.</p>

  <p>His eyes were filled with wrath, and the aura of his Soul of Light flowed out from him.</p>

  <p>His Soul of Light had turned into the Indigo Soul of the ultimate level, so the aura he emitted was naturally quite powerful. Those five-star Oneness Guards immediately blanched when they felt the immense pressure.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng was about to leave with Jago, another figure appeared beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>This person was another Oneness General in the Mountain Sea Pass, who was known as Basil Zhu. He had introduced himself to Zheng before.</p>

  <p>Basil Zhu stood in front of Zheng and politely said, "General Zheng, you can't take this person away." "Why?" Zheng asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"Although there are many warriors and his departure will not affect anything, I'm afraid it will be difficult to convince the crowd if you forcefully take him away," Basil Zhu said as he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, those who were driven away by the five-star Oneness Guards nearby watched them eagerly.</p>

  <p>It was clear that they were envious and unwilling.</p>

  <p>Like Basil Zhu had said, these people would definitely be upset if Zheng took only Jago away.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng said with arched brows. "In that case, I need a guard by my side. It's good that Jago becomes my guard!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, the warriors in the distance became restless again.</p>

  <p>"Master Zheng! I can also be your guard!"</p>

  <p>"Sir, I can serve you!"</p>

  <p>"General Zheng, I am much stronger than Jago and my Other Shore Token is..."</p>

  <p>As Basil Zhu watched the commotion among the crowd, he smiled peevishly at Zheng and said, "You can also see the current situation now. I didn't mean to stop you deliberately."</p>

  <p>The warriors on the lower tier were like a group of crabs in a bowl. Every time a warrior wanted to get out, the others pulled them back. None of them wanted to give up the chance to survive.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng glanced at Jago and told him, "You stay here first. I won't let anything happen to you."</p>

  <p>"Flag Master..." Tears welled up in Jago's eyes.</p>

  <p>"The other disciples of the Sword Light Palace will be fine as well," Zheng reassured him.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng returned to the upper tier and asked Basil Zhu about the Heavenly Wind Pass. It turned out that the Heavenly Wind Pass was next to the Mountain Sea Pass, and one could see it after moving a hundred miles southeast from the Mountain Sea Pass. Once the war began, the Heavenly Wind Pass on the right side and the Battle Rage Pass on the left would send out troops.</p>

  <p>After Basil Zhu's introduction, he said to Zheng in a low voice, "Zheng, what you did just now is reckless. If you need to bring that young man up, you can just inform those Oneness Guards first, but it's not appropriate for them to let you do that in public..."</p>

  <p>It actually didn't matter if Jago left the Mountain Sea Pass, but the members on the lower tier were miserable all the time. Therefore, it was troublesome to take him away in front of so many people.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I have been a bit reckless, but it's alright," Zheng replied. After all, it wasn't only Jago who he wanted to save.</p>

  <p>Nothing had happened in the first three days after Zheng had arrived at the Mountain Sea Pass. Not even a single Sun Crow had appeared.</p>

  <p>Sinclair and several other Oneness Generals were worried about it. The calmer it was, the greater trouble there would be.</p>

  <p>In those three days, the Vastness Mountain had sent three people to inspect the issue, and the seventeen Oneness Generals of the entire Mountain Sea Pass had to greet and meet them.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng had never seen those three people from the Vastness Mountain before.</p>

  <p>Despite that, those three frequently glanced at him while they inspected, and he didn't know if that was intentional or not.</p>

  <p>He naturally sensed a thing quite fast, but he kept calm. Instead, he couldn't help but feel taunted.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he had underestimated the Vastness Mountain. The Vastness Mountain would not give up the opportunity to make moves...</p>

  <p>However, the current Zheng was no longer what he used to be. Even a warrior as powerful as Natasha would fail to defeat him.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Vastness Mountain didn't dare to make a scene.</p>

  <p>On the fourth day, the white mist in the distance gradually dissipated, and some black dots floated within it.</p>

  <p>"There are enemies coming!" one of the Oneness Guards shouted when he realized what was happening.</p>

  <p>"The Sun Crows are coming!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up and inform everyone!"</p>

  <p>"Open the Sky Net!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The array that stretched thousands of miles released a beam of light, and then a huge net suddenly appeared. It was the Sky Net Array, which blocked the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>At that point, Sinclair and the other sixteen Oneness Generals stood at the top of the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>More and more black dots materialized in the distance. The densely packed Sun Crows gathered together and formed a huge dark cloud, which spread towards the Mountain Sea Pass. They looked like they moved slowly, but it was actually the opposite.</p>

  <p>"This will be another fierce battle," said Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"This time, their number is even bigger than before. I wonder if there are demon women of the Divine Lair there," Basil Zhu commented.</p>

  <p>To a Oneness General, the ordinary Sun Crows were nothing, and it was the demon women of the Divine Lair who posed a great threat.</p>
