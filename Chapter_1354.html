<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1354 Law Power Enhancement </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>An invisible wave of energy shot out of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. But it could only create a crack on the gate.</p>

  <p>The wave of energy released a lightning that was dark blue in color and a black-as-night wind blade. These two kinds of Law Powers intertwined together to form a blurry figure that rushed at Jim.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, his gaze suddenly freezing.</p>

  <p>"The fourth layer of the Wind Law and the fourth layer of the Thunder Law!"</p>

  <p>Until now, Zheng had only grasped the third layer of the Law Powers, irrespective of whether it was the Wind Law, the Thunder Law, or the Fire Law.</p>

  <p>But when he poured the chaotic energy into the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, it had actually touched upon the fourth layer of the Law Powers.</p>

  <p>Xun wrapped her arms around her knees and looked at Zheng's sword light through the crack. "This sword has the ability of Law Power enhancement," she said, impressed. "It's not bad for a first-rank divine weapon."</p>

  <p>"Law Power enhancement?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. This sword can help you increase your Law Power."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't that mean that I can display the fifth layer when I comprehend the fourth layer of the Law Power?" Zheng's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>Xun shook her head. "It isn't that easy! The gap between the fourth and the fifth layers is huge. Controlling the first few layers of the Law Power isn't difficult, but things are completely different when it comes to the higher layers. This sword can only enhance your Law Power, but it can't help you increase the layers."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in dawning comprehension. "So that's how it is!" It was already turning out to be of great help to him.</p>

  <p>What was more, the sword seemed to have more benefits than just this.</p>

  <p>For example, the blurry figure!</p>

  <p>Jim was a warrior belonging to the Swallow Cloud House, and was extremely confident in his own strength. The warriors from the Ice Cloud House and those from the Swallow Cloud House weren't easy to deal with. People who could enter the Mist Palace could be considered top talents in the Upper World, and only extremely powerful warriors of ten-grade sacred places were qualified to enter the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Only by standing out in Ice Cloud House and joining Swallow Cloud House could they be considered super talents, worthy of the alliance spending resources in nurturing them.</p>

  <p>This was why Jim was so arrogant. According to him, this new member of the Mist Palace had obtained the Thunder Wind Divine Sword through sheer luck.</p>

  <p>He had even thought that Zheng wouldn't dare fight him.</p>

  <p>But the moment he walked over unhesitatingly once this thought had crossed his mind, a blue bolt of lightning appeared before him. The bolt was circling around a black wind blade, and a faint figure hung behind the wind blade.</p>

  <p>His eyes shone, reflecting the lightning. All the hair on his body stood up, and before he could even take a breath, he was propelled backwards, a sword appearing in his hand. It was a shield sword!</p>

  <p>Jim loved to collect swords of all shapes, sizes, and functions. He had a large collection that included broadswords, two-handed swords, snake-shaped swords, rapiers and so on. There were all sorts of swords of all ranks— mysterious weapons, spiritual weapons, fairy weapons, sacred weapons— you named it, he had it!</p>

  <p>This shield sword was a type of heavy sword that was one and a half feet wide and three feet long. It looked like a shield.</p>

  <p>And as a secondary first-rank divine weapon, the sword had saved his life at many critical moments, helping him withstand many terrifying attacks.</p>

  <p>Jim had never thought that Zheng's sword attack would be so fierce. It was precisely because of this momentum that he felt the threat of death. So he unleashed his strongest life-saving technique without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Earth Elemental Shield Sword!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>He sent a surge of life vitality into his sword as he retreated.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A yellow light appeared on the sword, releasing a dense aura of Earth Law that caused the sword to appear even thicker and more solid.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the intense lightning strike landed on the large, heavy sword, leaving behind pitch-black patterns on its surface. It was as if small snakes were spreading on there.</p>

  <p>'I need to let go of the sword!' Jim thought.</p>

  <p>When the power of lightning spread across the sword, Jim dared not hold it. He let it drop and scrambled back as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's sword was not limited to just the power of lightning. Soon, the black wind blade cut through the shield sword, striking it in half.</p>

  <p>Retreat!</p>

  <p>Jim felt his heart break as he watched the damage done to the shield sword. But it was more important for him to stay alive. He retreated further, because there was also the blurry figure to contend with in addition to the lightning and the wind blade.</p>

  <p>Neither he nor Zheng knew anything about what was going on with it.</p>

  <p>But Jim had lost the protection of his shield sword, and the figure was charging straight at him. Even a fool would run away and try to escape.</p>

  <p>The figure, however, was fast and caught up with Jim in no time. Before Jim could comprehend what was going on, it threw a punch at him.</p>

  <p>This punch looked simple, but it would be foolish to underestimate it.</p>

  <p>Jim held up his arms against his chest as a reflex reaction.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Both of Jim's arms broke, but the force of the punch did not weaken and landed on his chest. He was sent flying backwards like a kite with its string cut, and landed heavily on the ground.</p>

  <p>It was very quiet in the room where Zheng was sitting. And he couldn't hear a single sound from outside, where everyone else was standing.</p>

  <p>The power of this strike not only surpassed the expectations of many onlookers, it also exceeded Zheng's expectations. Only Xun looked on indifferently.</p>

  <p>There were really not many things that could shock Xun. The Roaring Token that Zheng had previously displayed made her think it to be unbelievable because it had exceeded the scope of common sense. But she didn't think this sword was that amazing.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned as he looked at the gradually disappearing figure. He exclaimed, "Why does a person appear when I stab with my sword?"</p>

  <p>Xun threw him a look before answering him, "If my guess is right, that person's move can be modified. There won't be just one punch."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up at Xun's words. When he had stabbed the sword, he had felt like his mind had been linked to something. He had thought that this was an effect of the sword, but now that he thought about it, he realized that he had formed a connection with the figure in that instant.</p>

  <p>But Zheng wasn't sure how he could change the figure's movements. He would have to spend more time and effort figuring this out.</p>

  <p>Jim had been lying on the ground for quite a while before someone appeared and picked him up. The person cast a fierce glance in Zheng's direction before making a quick exit.</p>

  <p>No other warriors dared linger or approach Zheng's house.</p>

  <p>Jim belonged to the Swallow Cloud House, but had almost been disabled by Zheng's sword strike. How could this group of Ice Cloud House warriors not learn a lesson from Jim's fate? Wasn't this courting death?</p>

  <p>In no time, the area in front of Zheng's door had emptied.</p>

  <p>The corners of Zheng's mouth curled up in a smile at this.</p>

  <p>Finally, peace and quiet!</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't thought that he would attract such a huge reaction with just a sword strike. The people in the Mist Palace weren't easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>But he was sure no one would look for trouble with him in the near future.</p>

  <p>"What are your plans after this?" Zheng asked Xun cautiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng's strength at this moment was far from enough in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Even someone at the Spirit Supreme Realm could beat Zheng very easily, let alone a world lord.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Punishment, on the other hand, had the cultivation of a world lord. At Zheng's current strength, he wasn't even qualified to stand in front of her.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait!" Xun said with a queer smile.</p>

  <p>"Wait for what?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Wait for you to grow," Xun replied.</p>

  <p>This answer left Zheng speechless, unsure of whether to laugh or to cry.</p>

  <p>At this stage, Zheng's cultivation had already reached the peak of the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm. He should have been prepared to fight against the sixth small Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>But just as he was preparing for it, someone else had come to the Mist Palace. To Zheng's surprise, it was the previous owner of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, who was also the previous leader of the Mist Palace.</p>
