<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 373 Breaking Your Enchanted Barrier (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though he had exerted himself to the extreme, Luo Zheng was still out of his reach. Since the competition started, Luo Zheng had been combating only by the dint of his body and speed� he had not yet even exercised a single bit of his life vitality.</p>

  <p>'Is this guy really at the grade two of nature level?'</p>

  <p>'He must be a monster�'</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng strutting towards him with a smile not quite reaching his eyes and a chilling gaze, as if he was staring at a dead man, York felt a shudder run up his spine. In haste, he yelled at the referee, "I�I give up!</p>

  <p>I, York of Sea Peak, give up!"</p>

  <p>Void of any expression, the referee announced the result of the combat.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng won, York lost!"</p>

  <p>As the combat came to a conclusion, the light curtain of the enchanted barrier retreated sideways. Clutching at his chest, York blundered all the way off the arena as though there was a devil on his tail.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you're awesome!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! You have to be harsh to guys who eat their own words!"</p>

  <p>The turnout of the combat left the disciples of Drizzle Peak pumped up.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, those from Sea Peak were left quiet and ashen-faced.</p>

  <p>This time, Sea Peak not only lost the match but also their reputation. 'If York defeated Luo Zheng, we would still have a chance to turn the situation around. In the world of martial arts practitioners, the winners are considered heroes. If Sea Park won, we would be victorious. So what if one guy broke his word? Will you Drizzle Peak disciples complain like a whining housewife?' thought the members of Sea Peak in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Believing that they would win, many of the Sea Peak disciples were ready to make a counterattack against the potential accusation of they breaking their words with their snide remarks.</p>

  <p>However, York lost to Luo Zheng. That was way beyond anyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>It was utterly unimaginable for the disciples of Sea Peak. Even as they watched the battle unfold, they could not understand why York fell so weak that he could barely strike a threatening attack, even as he went above and beyond the three moves that he promised he would use to defeat Luo Zheng. Instead, he was vanquished by Luo Zheng in a single blow.</p>

  <p>The battle turned completely different from their expectations, so the disciples were still left in shock. In the face of Drizzle Peak's mocking, they felt their prepared snarky replies and words fail them. Now that they had just lost the match and disgraced themselves, they couldn't rack their brains enough to even find a retort.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng didn't go all out in the match, he still undoubtedly drew much attention, continuously changing the masters' opinion of him.</p>

  <p>Another participant piqued their interest� Tianming, a man that was said to be a once-in-five-centuries genius from Skytop Peak.</p>

  <p>Roger had always been confident about his speed, having accidentally obtained a secret manual on the method of movement entitled The Mystical Pace. The manual spoke more of a special pacing method than a method of movements� it contained a set of very unique prospects which could bring one's speed to its maximum capacity.</p>

  <p>Because he relied on the lessons of The Mystical Pace, Tianming was able to defeat an expert in the Illuminating Soul Realm in one quick strike of the sword.</p>

  <p>After seeing Zheng's demonstration of instant bursts of speed, Tianming noticed something odd.</p>

  <p>Although it looked intimidating, Tianming was not impressed by Zheng's speed at all since it was still much slower than when he used the Mystical Pace. Upon a closer look, he noticed that Luo Zheng did not resort to any method of movement when he was in motion but instead seemed to have been moving solely with his explosive force.</p>

  <p>The fact that he had reached such a fast and flexible speed without practicing any method of movement was what astonished Roger the most.</p>

  <p>'If Luo Zheng ever starts practicing those methods and picks up his speed�'</p>

  <p>Tianming contemplated Zheng's potential. 'This guy really is a freak.'</p>

  <p>Oblivious to how Tianming perceived him, Luo Zheng simply made his way back to the Drizzle Peak team and took a seat in the corner as if nothing had happened, waiting quietly for the next round.</p>

  <p>Master Wen and the other disciples did not dare go to bother him.</p>

  <p>Having won the two matches he fought in, he was probably Drizzle Peak's only hope.</p>

  <p>Battles in the arena proceeded, one round after another.</p>

  <p>At this year's All Peaks Competition, several amazingly powerful disciples of Cloud Sect showed up.</p>

  <p>Both the lower-ranked peaks, such as the Vulture and Billow Peaks, as well as the top-ranked ones, including Skytop and Blackrock, were proven to have some extremely gifted disciples participating in the matches. The competition in the group match stage was unusually fierce.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the performances of the Drizzle Peak disciples were far from satisfactory. Other than Luo Zheng who won two matches in a row, and another who lost two matches and won one, all the others ended in defeat.</p>

  <p>Soon, it was time for Luo Zheng to fight his third match.</p>

  <p>"Drizzle Peak's Luo Zheng versus Blackrock Peak's Mack!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Mack's name, Master Wen's expression hardened, along with those of the Drizzle Peak disciples, who let the fury surface onto their expressions.</p>

  <p>As a magic array master, Mack was not only highly powerful but very resourceful. Above all, he was a cruel man. It was Mack who tortured Yehudi, a seeded player of Drizzle Peak, right in the arena until he was unforgivably maimed.</p>

  <p>During the group stage of the competition, the loss of one match was not so much of a big deal. As long as one won his following battle, he still had a chance to enter the next round. However, after being mauled in such a way, even if some mystical medicine could work its magic and heal Yehudi, it was impossible for him to take on another battle within such a short time.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that everyone from Drizzle Peak hated Mack.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, pay attention to Mack's magic array. The array that bastard sets up could be wicked," Yehudi reminded Luo Zheng before he went up to the stage.</p>

  <p>After having fought him previously, Mack's magic array still made Yehudi's heartbeat stutter with fear.</p>

  <p>With a nod, Luo Zheng agreed. "Got it. I'll be more careful."</p>

  <p>In addition, Master Wen advised, "If you find yourself no match for him, just throw in the towel. No need to force yourself to persist to the very end. This guy is a real monster inside."</p>

  <p>Given that Luo Zheng had gained two consecutive victories already and was almost guaranteed an opportunity to make it to the next round, Master Wen didn't want Luo Zheng to push himself too much and he hoped his advice would keep Luo Zheng safe and sound until the next battle.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng nodded, he did not take the advice seriously. When it came to participating in such combat-based competitions, more often than not, the contestants were merely fighting for their esteem. Now that Luo Zheng had entered the All Peaks Competition, he was determined to win.</p>

  <p>With fiery eyes, Luo Zheng stepped into the arena.</p>
