  <p>
</p>

  <p>But now, the man in front of Luo Luo Zheng was far from the Owen back then. He exuded more strength, and had actually stepped into the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. Very soon, he might be able to reach the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Owen possessed great talent. He was an independent warrior, but he had incredible luck, and it seemed as if opportunity favored him. On top of this, he only came slightly weaker than Luo Luo Zheng and Brent in terms of strength. It would not be far from possible for him to become a powerful independent warrior in the future.</p>

  <p>"Did you join the World Commercial Alliance?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Owen nodded and spoke with a smile, "I see that you have already stepped into the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm!"</p>

  <p>To this day, the two men still shared similar goals. One of them was to save his sister from Eddie, and the other wanted to rescue his lover.</p>

  <p>Owen was visibly delighted to see Luo Luo Zheng. "Come with me," he said quickly.</p>

  <p>"You have just arrived at the Oracle City, so you might not be clear about the current situation."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head and took Xi Youqin's hand as they left the transmission array along with Owen. Then the three of them flew towards the World Commercial Alliance's headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Are all the members of the Cloud Hall in the headquarters of the World Commercial Alliance?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Fernandez had already told Luo Luo Zheng about the general situation, but he did not know the details.</p>

  <p>Owen's eyes flashed. Then, he said, "All the warriors of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance have been mixed up. Only a few members remain in the headquarters. The majority of them have already left the city."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the war between the sects was intense, but what he saw in the city exceeded his expectation by far. The leaders from both sides had not yet engaged in battle with one another, but blood had already been flowing like a river, painting the streets of the city in red.</p>

  <p>Two days ago, in order to fight for the Nine Furnace City, both the Heavenly Evil Sect and the World Commercial Alliance had lost thousands of warriors, most of whom were at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, two Virtual Tribulation Realm elders of the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall had also perished in battle.</p>

  <p>"Only the warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm and Internal Elixir Realm are taking part in the fight now, right? Why would the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors be killed?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Owen's face broke into a helpless smile. "Well, this also confuses us."</p>

  <p>The ranks of the warriors were based on where they stood in terms of cultivation levels, and the gap between one level and another was very large. Therefore, warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm would usually fight opponents with the same cultivation level. That two Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance had been killed by a group of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors was a disturbing enigma.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, an Illuminating Soul Realm warrior wouldn't be much of a threat to a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior. There would be too big of a gap in strength. Warriors like Luo Luo Zheng who were able to defeat a warrior with a higher cultivation level than his own were an extreme rarity.</p>

  <p>No matter how many Illuminating Soul Realm warriors fought together, it was hard for them to combine their forces and fight against a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior. It might also be difficult for a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior to kill a thousand Illuminating Soul Realm warriors, but when he couldn't defeat them, the Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior could still escape! Even only relying on speed, a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior could make one thousand Illuminating Soul Realm warriors collapse with exhaustion without taking damage himself.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Heavenly Evil Sect had developed a very strange fighting technique.</p>

  <p>They had used strange arrays. Making an array only needed the participation of a few warriors. For example, the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit had often formed an array together.</p>

  <p>However, the Heavenly Evil Sect had gathered hundreds of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors together to build energy arrays. It was a technique that had never been seen or heard of, but one that proved to be powerful. Even the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors would be killed instantly if they weren't careful enough.</p>

  <p>During the start of the sect war, the number of the strong warriors from both sides were almost the same. The Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance had unfathomable power, and now, Ning Yudie had also joined forces with them. As for the Heavenly Evil Sect, there were two Life and Death Realm warriors, Simon and Eddie.</p>

  <p>The numbers of the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors of both sides were also more or less the same.</p>

  <p>Initially, it was these elite warriors who would determine the result of the war. However, when the Heavenly Evil Sect used their special technique, the situation turned around drastically.</p>

  <p>By the strategic gathering and the use of a vast number of Illuminating Soul Realm disciples, the balance was broken.</p>

  <p>"This technique is complex. Eddie could not have thought of this easily.</p>

  <p>How did they make it?" After hearing what Owen said, Luo Luo Zheng felt confused, slightly frowning. Anxiousness crept inside of him as he thought of the warriors from the Cloud Hall who were fighting in the battles.</p>

  <p>Owen sighed and said, "Even we think so. A technique of this level and power is something that would take years to develop. Our leaders are speculating that it might have come from the four divine kingdoms."</p>

  <p>"The four divine kingdoms!" Luo Luo Zheng said, his eyes widening, "Could it be that..."</p>

  <p>Owen met his eyes steadily and nodded. "Yes. There might be a divine kingdom behind the Heavenly Evil Sect," Owen said with certainty.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly remembered the Holy Maiden and the prince of the divine kingdom in Mist's celestial tomb. He had killed the prince, and the Holy Maiden had sworn to get vengeance. Now, her words as she vowed to take revenge on him echoed in his head.</p>

  <p>Back then, Simon had helped the Holy Maiden to dispel the curse she had received, and the old man of the divine kingdom had promised to give Simon the internal version of the Scripture of Five Poisons as a symbol of gratitude.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng began piecing the puzzle together. There was a Chaotic Ocean of Stars between the Central Region and the four divine kingdoms. Could it be that there really were some members of the four divine kingdoms entering the Central Region?</p>
