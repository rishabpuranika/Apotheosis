<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy gave Zheng a meaningful look.</p>

  <p>Earlier in the year when the young man appeared in the universe with Xun, the Supreme Lord closely kept tabs on them.</p>

  <p>He had been hiding in the depths of this place for many years and had never seen the geniuses born in the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>This was his first time meeting Zheng and the young man made quite a shocking first impression. Zheng used his sword to cut off Supreme Lord Leroy's Scorching Sun Arrows, breaking through his Fixed Vision Theurgy which was a technique he had obtained from his Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality contained within that theurgy came from the heavens. How did Zheng manage to break it?</p>

  <p>He did it with such effortless finesse that it was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy burned with curiosity. Unfortunately for him, Zheng refused to give him any answers as to how he managed to do it. Behind Zheng were multiple Demon Night members. "I didn't expect the Demon Night race to reach this stage. It seems like our race is going to perish,"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy remarked indifferently.</p>

  <p>Ever since the battle between Yao and Xun, the entire Demon Night race fell into crippling, internal strife. It didn't help that the two remaining queens of the race went ahead and allied themselves with the Sacred race which was definitely far from what Supreme Lord Leroy wanted.</p>

  <p>Abby, one of the Demon Night race's grand world lords, stepped forward and bowed in front of the Supreme Lord. "Supreme Lord Leroy, now that the Demon Night race is under that woman's control, we are now in great trouble. I hope to the heavens that you can help the Saint Spear Sect."</p>

  <p>Sammy and Fannie had unnatural expressions on their faces when they heard what Abby said.</p>

  <p>Not all of the people present were from the Saint Spear Sect. Only about half belonged there.</p>

  <p>Sammy and Fannie weren't part of the Saint Spear Sect, but still chose to follow Zheng here. On the one hand, they did not approve of Yao's actions. On the other hand, all the prisoners they were supposed to be guarding on the Prison Island had escaped which they no doubt would answer for in the future.</p>

  <p>They were still from the Saint Chain Sect. Ever since their youth, they had always believed in the Queen of Punishment. Hearing Abby talk badly about her made them quite uncomfortable. Regardless of their discomfort though, they believed that she was right.</p>

  <p>"I know," Supreme Lord Leroy affirmed. He might have been hidden deep underground all these years, but pieces of news that were announced through the Roaring Tokens supplied him with just enough information to know what was currently happening in the universe.</p>

  <p>"Where's Xun? Why didn't she come out to see me?"</p>

  <p>The person he cared about the most was Xun. He had hidden for so many years, but the moment Zheng had brought Xun back, he had been the first to respond.</p>

  <p>So why didn't he see her given Zheng was already here?</p>

  <p>This question was actually what was also in the minds of all Demon Night members.</p>

  <p>They could clearly feel Xun's aura on the Prison Island, but why did she never appear?</p>

  <p>A trace of sadness appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"How is she?" Supreme Lord Leroy asked, already feeling nervous about Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes flashed and a red light shot out from his pupils.</p>

  <p>He summoned his sword spirit out of his body along with Xun's soul.</p>

  <p>Both his sword spirit and Xun fused into one. At that moment, however, Xun merely floated with her eyes shut. It was as if she were a mere, inanimate puppet.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>All the Demon Night members of the Saint Spear Sect bent down on one knee at the sight of Xun. Sammy and Fannie also showed their respect despite a moment of hesitation. Despite everything, Xun was still one of their queens.</p>

  <p>"How could this be?" Even Supreme Lord Leroy couldn't believe the sight in front of him. Xun's soul had not completely disappeared, so why did she look like this? He could still clearly feel her soul.</p>

  <p>Xun's soul hadn't been completely destroyed; however, she was not completely whole. The Soul-sealing Needle that had embedded itself into her soul had to be erased. To do that, Xun's memories had to be sacrificed. Right now, her mind was a blank slate, devoid of both memories and emotions.</p>

  <p>"Her memories have been erased along with the Soul-sealing Needle,"</p>

  <p>Zheng explained. He then told Supreme Lord Leroy the deduction of the Soul-sealing Needle and Murphy's scheme.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy couldn't help but sigh. "So that's how it is. I always thought that no matter how crazy Yao is, she couldn't possibly bring the Demon Night race down to this. Now I know why. It turns out we were actually hiding such a secret!"</p>

  <p>Yao was very ambitious, but all of her plans were centered around the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>However, right now, her declaration of war against the entire universe was sure to plunge the entire Demon Night race into destruction. This was a bit strange.</p>

  <p>Zheng's words gave the Demon Night members present much-needed clarity. Indeed, no one would have ever thought that the members of the Demon Night race weren't born in this universe.</p>

  <p>"But given Xun's situation, what should we do?" Supreme Lord Leroy asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head in defeat. "I don't know either."</p>

  <p>A person's soul was complex and mysterious. Nobody in this universe had ever sought out to learn the mysteries of the soul, let alone the memories within it.</p>

  <p>How could Xun's memories ever be recovered? Zheng had absolutely no clue.</p>

  <p>"I will do my best to help her," Zheng promised. He then waved his hand and Xun's soul returned back into his body. Zheng turned towards the Demon Night members. "At present, I need your help. The Demon Night race needs a new leader!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy was once Xun's guardian, so he had quite a stellar reputation in their race.</p>

  <p>According to the information Zheng managed to gather, the Demon Night sects weren't faring quite well. The Saint Spear Sect had already fallen apart while the other five remained dissatisfied with Yao and Ying.</p>

  <p>The elites still followed the two queens, but were already regretting their decision.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Demon Night race had no choice though. The two queens wielded absolute power over the entire race and going against them was quite difficult.</p>

  <p>However, if Supreme Lord Leroy came out on behalf of Xun, then they could turn the situation around. His emergence might very well give all the Demon Night members a second chance.</p>

  <p>"Haha..." Supreme Lord Leroy suddenly let out a loud laugh, though there was a tinge of misery in his mirth.</p>

  <p>"Will you be willing to do it?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm willing to do it. This is what I've been waiting for!" he answered with gusto. "Come with me!"</p>

  <p>It seemed that the old Supreme Lord was now bursting with energy.</p>

  <p>He suddenly stood up and lifted the stone bed beneath him!</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The heavy stone bed smashed into the ground revealing a set of stairs that descended down. There seemed to be a hidden cave underneath!</p>

  <p>The moment the cave was opened, the heavy stench of blood permeated the air.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy was the first to walk down, followed closely by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite their curiosity, the Demon Night members dared not follow.</p>

  <p>As the two descended, Zheng discovered a small cave. In the middle was a crevice where three bloody arrows stuck out of.</p>

  <p>The moment he saw those arrows, Zheng suddenly felt his soul stir. It was as if those arrows were coming for him and just one strike would be enough to kill him.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy noticed his gaze and beamed proudly, "These three arrows were made from my own ribs. They're called the Blood-devouring Bone Arrows!"</p>

  <p>His words puzzled Zheng greatly. "It feels as if these arrows are living things."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know how, but he felt the breath of life from these three arrows.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy smiled even wider. "These three Blood-devouring Bone Arrows are connected to my life force. Every time I shoot one, my life will decline by a third. Once all three arrows are shot, my life is over."</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression quickly changed when he heard this.</p>

  <p>Three arrows forged with the life of a Supreme Lord?</p>

  <p>Just how powerful could they be?</p>

  <p>"I've been forging these three arrows ever since I went into hiding.</p>

  <p>Finally, this day has come."</p>
