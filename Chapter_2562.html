  <p>Luo Zheng was still waiting in the square.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li people didn't leave either, and once word of the broken Blood Stone spread, even more of them had flocked to the square.</p>

  <p>The Blood Stone was very important to the Nine Li race. After all, the purity of its people's blood was tested by it. When that was determined, each member would be cultivated according to their blood purity.</p>

  <p>The purer their blood was, the more rewards they could receive and the more resources they could access.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Stone is broken. How will we hold the blood purity test in the future?"</p>

  <p>"Grand Elder will think of something, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"But where is she? Where has she been for so long?"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Two beams of light suddenly burst from the depths of the cave.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned and saw Adele, followed closely by a middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>At first, he thought nothing of him. Taking a closer look, however, Luo Zheng recoiled, and his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man had hidden his cultivation base well, but Luo Zheng still sensed a strange aura emanating from him.</p>

  <p>'Is this person an exile?' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, Adele pointed at Luo Zheng and addressed the man with the peculiar aura. "Father, he is  Luo Zheng Luo," she said loudly.</p>

  <p>The square fell silent again. Even Giacomo couldn't help but take a few steps back.</p>

  <p>Adele was the Grand Elder of the Nine Li race, but it was clear that she was not the strongest among its members.</p>

  <p>The most powerful masters of the Nine Li race were reclusive, spending most of their time hiding in the bone towers, and the chances of crossing paths with one of them were slim.</p>

  <p>No one knew how powerful those masters really were, but their secretive nature gave rise to many tales and legends. The most commonly told story was that one master had slaughtered hundreds of people of the Yellow Emperor race single-handedly.</p>

  <p>After all, many people had witnessed that horrible scene and lived to tell the tale.</p>

  <p>His eyes firmly fixed on Luo Zheng, the middle-aged man walked slowly towards him. After having scrutinized him for a while, he finally spoke.</p>

  <p>"If I am not wrong, you have already acquired the Truth of Divine Dao," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>As soon as these words had escaped the man's mouth, Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up.</p>

  <p>There were many people in this world who could determine Luo Zheng's cultivation base and identify him as a True God, but the middle-aged man was a step ahead. His vision was so sharp that he could tell Luo Zheng had actually cultivated the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"That's strange. If you have the blood of the Nine Li race, it should be very difficult for you to be taken in by other races, and bordering on impossible for you to learn the Truth of Divine Dao from those powerful humans. Where did you cultivate the Truth of Divine Dao? Do you even come from this world?"</p>

  <p>Earlier, when the middle-aged man had heard Adele's words, he had already been very interested in Luo Zheng's origins. Now, he was completely overcome with curiosity. After all, the purity of Luo Zheng's blood was beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>He had seen with his own eyes that Luo Zheng had the aura of the Truth of Divine Dao. That made it even more difficult to explain.</p>

  <p>In this world, almost all living beings mainly focused on cultivating the Wild God system, relying on massive wild bones left over from the savage and wild times.</p>

  <p>Some did choose to cultivate the True God system, but they were few and far between.</p>

  <p>Under his guidance, Adele had opened up her inner world, and even condensed the Godly Tile, but she had not managed to go far along this path.</p>

  <p>The reason was that it was too difficult to become True Gods in this world. In comparison, it was much easier to become Wild Gods, so the majority chose the latter.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Luo Zheng had begun to comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao as a top-rank True God. It was impossible for him to have come this far unless those powerful humans had taught him in person.</p>

  <p>'How shrewd this man is!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rather shocked in his heart.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, unsure how to react or answer.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, he didn't need to answer. The middle-aged man had read his mind. "Our race is extremely united in the Source World," he said, his voice warm. "No matter where you have come from, as long as you do not harm us, we will treat you as family."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was silent for a while. "Can I not answer your question now?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>"Sure," the middle-aged man replied with a smile. "But I need to test your blood purity again."</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man already had a few theories about Luo Zheng's background, but he still wanted to test Luo Zheng's blood purity, to be absolutely sure.</p>

  <p>"Okay," said Luo Zheng, nodding and reaching out his hand to the middle-aged man again.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man stretched out his hand and touched Luo Zheng's finger lightly. A drop of bright golden blood escaped from Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea about the method the man had used to extract his blood in this way.</p>

  <p>When the middle-aged man saw the bright golden blood, his expression turned grave. Lightly, he flicked his hand.</p>

  <p>"Ticktock!"</p>

  <p>A drop of blood shot from his fingertip and immediately merged with Luo Zheng's golden blood droplet.</p>

  <p>Then a small magic array emerged and covered the two men's blood, rotating in the air.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, the magic array suddenly seemed to burst with unparalleled power.</p>

  <p>It was as if there was a giant beast hiding inside that tiny blood drop.</p>

  <p>Then, the drop of red blood from the middle-aged man was completely devoured by Luo Zheng's golden blood drop.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man's expression had, until now, been serene and content. Now, however, his smile abruptly faded away.</p>

  <p>His eyes seemed to blaze with light. He looked at Luo Zheng in disbelief and said excitedly, "Your, your blood..."</p>

  <p>"Father, what's wrong?" asked Adele anxiously. She had never seen her father so excited.</p>

  <p>Giacomo and the others were also baffled by his reaction.</p>

  <p>After all, the middle-aged man, Adele's father, was a supreme existence in their race. They were lucky to have had the chance to see such a powerful man in their lifetimes.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"How can you have an imperial-grade bloodline? How could it be possible?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man couldn't control his excitement any longer. He suddenly shouted, "Bro! Leopold! Guess what I saw! Hahaha! I can't believe I found an imperial-grade bloodline! It's right here! Right in this cage!"</p>

  <p>His voice carried, and was heard in a cave far away.</p>

  <p>In the depths of that cave lived several exiles who had sealed themselves inside large jades and stayed there all the year round without making a sound.</p>

  <p>"What? What is Ramzi talking about? The imperial-grade bloodline? Is it a dream?"</p>

  <p>"There is the imperial-grade bloodline in this world? It's impossible."</p>

  <p>"Let's go have a look."</p>

  <p>"Clank! Clank! Clank!"</p>

  <p>The jades broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>The masters of the Nine Li race who had just broken their jade cages immediately transformed into beams of light and shot to the square.</p>

  <p>In no time, several figures appeared above the square, all of them looking down at Luo Zheng with curious expressions.</p>

  <p>The oldest among them asked, "Ramzi, are you sure this young man has the imperial-grade bloodline of our race? Or did you make a mistake?"</p>
