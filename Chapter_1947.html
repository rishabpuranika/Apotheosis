  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Where is the place where the humans are slaughtered?" Zheng asked as he stared at him.</p>

  <p>Aiden was uncomfortable at Zheng's gaze. 'Is this guy planning to charge in alone?' he thought.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had a lot of troops stationed in the Seven Ultimate World even though it wasn't an important world. There weren't any Supreme Lords present, but there were several world lords and two grand world lords.</p>

  <p>The human world lord standing before him was strong enough, but wanting to rely on himself to contend against the Sacred race in the Seven Ultimate World? This was too naive.</p>

  <p>But Aiden would still be happy to see this fellow throw his life away.</p>

  <p>"All human beings are being escorted to the Ultimate Immortal City. But there are nine world lords and two grand world lords guarding the city.</p>

  <p>I'd advise you..."</p>

  <p>Zheng interrupted him. "Nice try."</p>

  <p>Aiden's heart trembled. He couldn't wait for Zheng to go to the Ultimate Immortal City to seek death, which was why he was urging Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I never intended to spare your life," Zheng continued, a faint smile on his face. "But I'll spare your life now, and let you watch as I head towards the Ultimate Immortal City."</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out and patted Aiden on the forehead, sending a strange power shooting through Aiden's mind like a wriggly snake.</p>

  <p>This power shook Aiden's mind and he felt his vision turn black before he fainted.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around before locking onto a direction. In a flash, he stepped into the air and disappeared into the rain of blood, his body shifting over a hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>Once reaching the first level of the Grand Teleportation of the Space Law, one was able to cover a hundred miles with each step.</p>

  <p>Zheng would not get lost in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>He had the Teleportation Token and the Roaring Token. To him, the entire Evolutionary Universe was an open, unobstructed place. But right now, Zheng was not in a hurry to return to the Celestial Position race. He felt that he needed to do something.</p>

  <p>Travelling through the supreme world wasn't difficult after becoming a world lord.</p>

  <p>It would take several decades for a warrior of the Soul Sea Realm to cross a supreme world on foot without the help of a spatial channel. But it would only take a few days for Zheng to cross the supreme world.</p>

  <p>Blood-red clouds churned in the sky as if there were millions of vengeful spirits howling within. Zheng continued to travel through the blood rain.</p>

  <p>When droplets of blood landed on Zheng's body, his lips pursed into a thin line to the point where one couldn't see them anymore. Just how many human beings had been slaughtered to cause this blood rain?</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Zheng's gaze landed on a valley below.</p>

  <p>A countless number of humans passed through this long, narrow valley.</p>

  <p>There was also a small number of martial artists of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>The cultivation of these Sacred martial artists wasn't too high. They were only at the Internal Elixir Realm and the Virtual Tribulation Realm. But these few Sacred martial artists were able to escort hundreds of thousands of human mortals.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze narrowed as he changed direction and shot towards the valley.</p>

  <p>The humans in the valley formed a long line and walked slowly along the road. The blood rain formed a blackish red colored mud once it dried up. The stench it gave off was disgusting. The mud was wet and slippery, so one would have to be careful or risk falling.</p>

  <p>Most of these human beings were ordinary people. Although they were all born in the Upper World, they had never practiced martial arts.</p>

  <p>Not everyone had the potential to become a martial artist. To ordinary people, a martial artist at the nature level was already a top tier martial artist.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Stop dawdling!" A warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm was floating above their heads. He held a black whip in his hand as he shouted to the crowd.</p>

  <p>These mortals were the citizens of the Creek Kingdom in the Seven Ultimate World.</p>

  <p>To a martial artist, travelling 10, 000 miles in a day wasn't much of a task. But a mortal being able to travel 20 miles in a single day was strong enough.</p>

  <p>They had traveled 40 miles, forced by these martial artists. Every one of them was exhausted and at the end of their physical strength.</p>

  <p>What was more, most of the old and the sick had already been eliminated along the way. A majority of those who survived were young and strong, with only a few being elders and children.</p>

  <p>"Grandma, why are they so fierce?" A lively-looking little girl in pigtails asked as she stared at the martial artists in the sky. She was in her prime, but had fallen unto such dangerous times.</p>

  <p>The old woman beside the little girl had a pained expression on her face.</p>

  <p>At her age, walking 40 miles was a miracle, but the martial artists were still dissatisfied. To them, they were being far too slow.</p>

  <p>But no one dared stop. A vivid image of the people who had died so miserably before was burned into their imagination.</p>

  <p>"Sweetheart, don't ask," the old granny said weakly.</p>

  <p>As she finished her sentence, she lost her balance and fell heavily to the ground. But she didn't have the strength to get up again.</p>

  <p>"Grandma! Grandma!" the little girl screamed, but no matter how loudly and how many times she called, the old woman didn't open her eyes.</p>

  <p>The path within the valley was quite narrow. The old woman, having fallen down, was now blocking the line of people behind her.</p>

  <p>A warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm in the sky noticed the commotion.</p>

  <p>He flew over, the long whip in his hand held aloft. "What's going on here?"</p>

  <p>They paled as they saw the martial artist approach.</p>

  <p>One of the humans said, "Sir, we've already traveled forty miles today.</p>

  <p>We're too tired to walk. Can we rest for a bit?"</p>

  <p>"Take a break?" the martial artist sneered. "Cut the crap! Taking you to Ultimate Immortal City in three days is my mission! If you delay my time, all of you will die!"</p>

  <p>As the martial artist spoke, the whip in his hand lashed downwards like a snake.</p>

  <p>A martial artist of the Internal Elixir Realm might not be worth mentioning in the Evolutionary Universe, but against these powerless mortals, they were existences that ruled over life and death.</p>

  <p>The whip lashed towards the old woman.</p>

  <p>The little girl in pigtails was still crying helplessly beside the old woman's body, and didn't notice the danger hovering above her head.</p>

  <p>Once the Sacred race had occupied the Seven Ultimate World, they began an unprecedented massacre that didn't spread to the ordinary humans from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>The first ones they eliminated were the people in the three sacred places within the Seven Ultimate World.</p>

  <p>Among them was the Saint Lord of the Seven Ultimate Sacred Place, who led the elites to resist with all their might. But he had died in the end.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had spent less than three days occupying these three sacred places, at a speed that was truly astonishing.</p>

  <p>Even after occupying the Seven Ultimate World, the Sacred race had never planned to act against the commoners from the start.</p>

  <p>There were often tens of thousands of mortal kingdoms of various sizes in a supreme world. The strongest powerhouses of these mortal kingdoms only had cultivations of the Illuminating Soul Realm, and it was very rare for them to reach the Virtual Tribulation Realm. So the Sacred race merely ignored the mortals.</p>

  <p>The mortal kingdoms, on the other hand, had always been silent about what the Sacred race had done.</p>

  <p>The mortals knew, through the voices from the Roaring Tokens, that a "Sacred race" had been invading the universe these past few years. But they didn't pay much attention to what the Sacred race actually was.</p>

  <p>After all, these battles didn't have anything to do with the mortals.</p>

  <p>They believed that even though the Sacred race occupied the Seven Ultimate World, they would not act against the mortal kingdoms because they were not a threat.</p>

  <p>But this time was different.</p>

  <p>The elites of the Humanity Alliance often resorted to roundabout tactics.</p>

  <p>Usually, after the Sacred race took over a supreme world, the Humanity Alliance would then quietly seize it back.</p>

  <p>There were too many supreme worlds, so it was impossible for the Sacred race to send out people to guard each of the supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was annoyed by the tactics of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>They discovered that no matter how hard they tried, they just couldn't take another step forward. In these three years, after eating up more than 3000 supreme worlds, they didn't have the energy to attack the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>This was not an ideal result for the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>But the leaders of the Sacred race managed to come up with a solution.</p>

  <p>They could use the Blood Curse Technique to seal the supreme worlds they occupied.</p>

  <p>The Blood Curse Technique was a very sinister and dangerous curse. It could harm the humans once it was successfully set up. Their entire bodies would rot, and their life vitality would flow in reverse. They would finally die from the pain and torture.</p>
