<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The blow dealt by Kenneth's hand disturbed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>His fist let out a faint yellow light, which shot straight up into the sky, chasing the direction of Saint Viana's escape. Everyone present had their eyes fixed on that light.</p>

  <p>With admirable cultivation base, he being at the Illuminating Soul Realm, Saint Viana made full use of his life vitality to escape at a super fast speed.</p>

  <p>The speed was so astonishing that Saint Viana quickly turned into a mere speck in the sky in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>As astonishing as Saint Viana's speed was, it could never compare to the velocity of the light released from Kenneth's fist. This light seemed to travel through space before it hit the small speck in the sky in an instant!</p>

  <p>People with excellent vision watched in horror as the light struck Saint Viana and instantly burst into pieces before finally falling towards the ground like a rain of blood.</p>

  <p>Long distance notwithstanding, Kenneth still managed to kill Saint Viana with just a fist. The sight sent a chill up everyone's spine. Kenneth's power was beyond everyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>Rooted to the spot was Saint Zara. Seeing the tragic end of Saint Viana stunned him. And his now ashen face showed how scared he was.</p>

  <p>In his fear, the idea of running away at that very moment crossed his mind. He thought that with their fast speed, they could run in different directions and there would be at least one person who could successfully escape and survive. But when he thought about the idea again, he considered it quite childish aside from being ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Kenneth's eyes bored into Saint Zara's as he uttered coldly, "Zara, considering your great contribution to Cloud Sect all these years, and you were only egged on by Viana, I've decided to just punish you by ordering you to spend the rest of your life in Hell Mountain."</p>

  <p>While Saint Zara was at the peak of Illuminating Soul Realm, he had to submit to a lifespan and, at most, there were only 30 or 40 years left for him to survive. He would be staying in Hell Mountain until the end of his life.</p>

  <p>But of course, it was better to be alive than dead. And there might be another chance to turn things around as long as he was still alive. So there was no question that he would accept the punishment and nodded, thanking Kenneth for sparing his life.</p>

  <p>After that, Kenneth turned to glance at Johanson, who lay motionless on the ground like a dead dog. Kenneth's roar left him unconscious. Shaking his head, he sighed. Kenneth didn't have to concern himself with people like Johanson. As it was, there were severe punishments in the Cloud Sect's Commandant Hall waiting for him.</p>

  <p>From Johanson's unmoving figure, his eyes fell on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Kenneth turned to look at him, Luo Luo Zheng had a feeling that the man just looked right through him. But after a while, he heard Kenneth say, "You are not bad." Then he tossed Luo Luo Zheng something small and black and said,</p>

  <p>"My roar may have injured you internally. Take this pill as it will benefit you a lot. I would like to see you put force in your power in the next competitions."</p>

  <p>Catching the black object, Luo Luo Zheng looked at it closely. It was a pill.</p>

  <p>Examining its outer cover, he saw nothing special about it.</p>

  <p>Once he had said the words, Kenneth left the field, flying back to his seat without a backward glance. Just then, Elder Xu went up to Luo Luo Zheng and in a kind tone said, "Take the pill. It's a Blood Condensation Pill that not only heals all internal injuries, but is also good for your pneuma and blood."</p>

  <p>The truth was Luo Luo Zheng was not hurt by Kenneth's roar.</p>

  <p>Like everyone present, Luo Luo Zheng was affected by the tremendous force of Kenneth's roar. However, his body was not easily hurt and didn't suffer that way.</p>

  <p>Judging by Xu's tone, he thought the pill must be very precious. Besides, how could he refuse a favor from the leader?</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng didn't know was how much Xu, and everyone who understood how valuable the pill was, envied him.</p>

  <p>While the Blood Condensation Pill was used to heal internal injuries, this was only an extra function. Its most crucial effect was to increase pneuma and blood.</p>

  <p>The impact of pneuma and blood on people couldn't be stressed enough.</p>

  <p>Having high amounts of both components could help someone quickly recover after injury. On the other hand, a lack of pneuma and blood would result in excruciating pain during a long illness which might be caused even by a small wound. Aside from having an effect on the speed of wound healing, enough pneuma and blood played an indispensable role in endurance and physical strength.</p>

  <p>"The winner is Luo Luo Zheng of Drizzle Peak! The personal disciple Johanson is defeated," the referee announced.</p>

  <p>After the result of the competition was made known, two stewards went out to the field and carried Johanson away.</p>

  <p>After witnessing Luo Zheng's excellent performance in the competition, the disciples of Cloud Sect had a clearer impression of the young Luo's strength.</p>

  <p>Before meeting Johanson, people thought there was a chance for Luo Luo Zheng to enter the top 10 since he was not expected to beat the personal disciple, who was anticipated to be in the top five. No one certainly expected Johanson to be completely overpowered by Luo Luo Zheng in assassination, which was the personal disciple's specialization.</p>

  <p>The power of the young Luo had become unfathomable in the disciples' eyes.</p>

  <p>Still, what was most important for Luo Luo Zheng was Kenneth's earlier comment about him.</p>

  <p>"You are not bad!"</p>

  <p>Kenneth was the leader of Cloud Sect and considered a divine figure of the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>There once was an emperor of the Burning Sky Empire named Kane, who was stronger than Kenneth. But since his disappearance, Kenneth became the No. 1 in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Hearing the No. 1 in the region say "not bad" undoubtedly was a great honor for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With Luo Luo Zheng earning high praise from Kenneth, who would dare look down upon him?</p>

  <p>Despite Kenneth's praise, it was not enough for people to believe Luo Luo Zheng could take the first place in the All Peaks Competition.</p>
