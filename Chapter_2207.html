<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2207 Making Things Difficult For Luo Luo Zheng </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Upon hearing Yazid's words, all the members of the Han Clan's sub-branches, including the leader of the Heavenly Han House, Malloy, looked forlorn.</p>

  <p>The sub-branches of the Han Clan possessed a special recommendation right, and they attached great importance to this right. They seldom used it, but once they used, they only recommended capable and competent people.</p>

  <p>Although Yazid was shouldered with the responsibility of evaluating all the candidates, his duty was just a formality. Usually, he didn't do it too seriously. After all, the sub-branches of the Han Clan wouldn't recommend any random person casually. Else, the real strength of the one that was recommended would be disclosed once they came to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>In fact, Adam, the youngest son of Bentley, could definitely not be considered as a loser. He had suffered something undisclosed after he went to the Floating Island of the Han Clan. That was how he got into such a situation.</p>

  <p>If Yazid was really going to take the test seriously, then it would obviously be difficult for Tianxing.</p>

  <p>The people from the Heavenly Han House were naturally nervous.</p>

  <p>Looking at the nervous expressions on the faces of the people from the sub-branches of the Han Clan, Yazid was complacent. In his eyes, none of these people was able to question him. He continued to raise his voice and sneered, "Why hasn't the boy arrived yet? If I have to wait any longer, I shall leave at once!"</p>

  <p>"Hold on! He has arrived!"</p>

  <p>The guard from the Heavenly Han House came from outside the main hall, to announce their arrival.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng followed, led by two guards and stepped into the main hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a little thrilled, knowing that his plan was going on smoothly.</p>

  <p>After all, entering the Floating Island was the crucial part.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he stepped inside the hall, he sensed something amiss.</p>

  <p>The headmen of the sub-branches of the Han Clan, including Bentley and Malloy, looked gloomy. In fact, Bentley to some extent even looked angry! As a top-rank True God, the leader of the sub-branches of the Han Clan could not be ignored in the entire divine land. What happened that made him so angry?</p>

  <p>Glancing at Luo Luo Zheng indifferently, Yazid said in a voice dripping with sarcasm, "I thought you were going to recommend someone incredibly talented. But it turns out you bring another waste to the Floating Island!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng frowned slightly, and an imperceptible cold light flashed through his eyes. Yazid sat on the top of the main hall with a dignified and arrogant expression. Luo Luo Zheng could tell at a glance that this person was probably the key person to bring him to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>But he didn't expect the old man to call him a waste. That was highly insulting of him!</p>

  <p>Though the people of the sub-branches of the Han Clan didn't speak on his behalf, Luo Luo Zheng didn't lose his temper. Instead, the flame of excitement in his heart instantly went out, and his face looked cold.</p>

  <p>"Ahem," Malloy cleared his throat in his attempt to break the tension hovering in the air. Although there was some sort of strain between Yazid and Bentley, they had to place the current situation as priority.</p>

  <p>"This Tianxing Luo was recognized by hundreds of Divine Dao Tablets in the test of the Heavenly Han House. He is really someone to be reckoned with, so we recommend him to you. And he is definitely no waste."</p>

  <p>Yazid looked surprised after hearing Malloy speak with such affirmation.</p>

  <p>He snorted and said, "Being acknowledged by hundreds of Divine Dao Tablets is just because of his potential. Moreover, you should chew no more than you can swallow. A truly promising genius can achieve great success only by cultivating one Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>Yazid said those words only to belittle Tianxing. In fact, many True Gods cultivated not just one kind of Divine Dao. Sometimes it would act more effectively when one Divine Dao was infused with several other ones.</p>

  <p>But nevertheless, his words also made some sense. Being admitted by hundreds of Divine Dao Tablets was in itself a shocking feat. Luo Luo Zheng had even grasped the internal momentum of those Divine Dao through the Infinity Ruler. However, despite all this, Luo Zheng's strength did not improve much.</p>

  <p>Faced against a mighty enemy, Luo Luo Zheng still had to rely on his Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Malloy didn't want to argue with Yazid either. He knew that Luo Zheng's strong points were not just being recognized by the Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>Although this mysterious lad didn't show much competence, his real strength was hidden like an iceberg. Till date, everyone was aware of just the tip of his skills. His actual and true potentials were still unknown to many.</p>

  <p>"Whether or not Tianxing has the ability to enter the Floating Island, please feel free to test him," Malloy said as he smiled faintly. He seemed very confident.</p>

  <p>Yazid was even more agitated seeing Malloy's arrogant reaction. He felt compelled to bring trouble to the Han Clan's sub-branches.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he felt a little depressed at the sight of this intense Mu Ning. No matter what kind of conflict there was between the sub-branches of Han Clan and this top-rank True God, it seemed he would definitely have to bear the consequences.</p>

  <p>"Alright then! Let's see what this fellow is capable of!" Yazid smirked and took a deep breath. A great power burst out, echoing throughout the main hall.</p>

  <p>The power contained the internal momentum of the Five Elements Divine Dao, which meant he activated the same.</p>

  <p>The faces of the masters of the sub-branches darkened with resentment.</p>

  <p>Yazid was a top-rank True God, but should he activate his own Divine Dao to test a proving godly warrior?</p>

  <p>When Bentley had tested Luo Luo Zheng last time, he had only used his brute strength to spar with Luo Luo Zheng. But unexpectedly, he was defeated by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Bentley didn't show a slightest trace of anger. A dignified top-rank True God always had a temperament.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yazid used Divine Dao at the very beginning. Was he really going to stoop so low by killing Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Everyone shared the same thoughts, but no one dared to say it in words.</p>

  <p>They were well aware that it would only add more fuel to the flames.</p>

  <p>Hence they chose to remain silent and watch the scene in front of them.</p>

  <p>"What does he intend to do? He is a top-rank True God. How could he suppress you by the Five Elements Divine Dao? Luo Luo Zheng, run!" Even Master Evil was stunned. He practiced the Heinously Evil Way and had a very black heart with zero emotions and feelings. Despite his nature, he was shocked to see the old man react in such a shameless way.</p>

  <p>"Who knows why the True God is carrying such resentment towards me." Luo Luo Zheng was filled with depression. He was extremely unhappy, but in the end, he still had to deal with the old man. After all, it was an opportunity to enter the Floating Island, and Luo Luo Zheng was not willing to neglect it. Perhaps the old man had some other intentions.</p>

  <p>"Son, I have cultivated the Five Elements Divine Dao for twelve divine eras and formed my own understanding. I can transform the internal momentum into the Five Elements Destructing. If you can resist for even five minutes, you will have passed the test." Yazid smiled coldly. He did not have any personal vendetta against Luo Luo Zheng at all, but he had a nasty intention to suppress the arrogance of the sub-branches of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Hence he had no option but to be hard on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as he spoke, the internal momentum inside the main hall began to compress. It soon transformed into the Law Power of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Destructing was a token that was comprehended by Yazid in the Five Elements Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The power of the five elements was so strong that it was enough to create a world of its own, but it was still an incomplete world created by the token of the five elements. However, Yazid tried his best to make up an incomplete but incredible destructing world, that was considered to be novel in this Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>As soon as the internal momentum kept on evolving, it transformed into a brilliantly shining world. It was only about ten square meters, big enough to cover Luo Luo Zheng completely.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have entered the illusion. Everything around him had disappeared, as he stepped into a world made by the power of the five elements. The ground beneath his feet, the golden light in the sky, the tree at a distance, the tsunami that came overwhelmingly from afar, and the fire clouds made up a wonderful world.</p>

  <p>However, the world was rapidly collapsing and destructing.</p>

  <p id="top_18">In the destructive mode, the powers of the five elements collided with each other and at the same time attacked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes shot up sharply. The top-rank True God's attack was quite extraordinary. The powers of the five elements intertwined and released an extremely complicated power. That kind of energy was completely different from the energy contained in the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain became extremely complex after condensing five types of laws, hence it proved to be very stable.</p>

  <p>However, Yazid could make those Law Powers crash each other and cause destruction. An extremely unstable destructing energy burst out.</p>

  <p>Since it was not stable, the power would be multiplied.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Luo Zheng was surrounded by the destructing energy.</p>

  <p>Streaks of sharp golden light cut through Luo Zheng's body, while the flames burned Luo Luo Zheng with vigorous intensity. Luo Luo Zheng could endure the attack of these Law Powers, but when the destructing energy burst out, he felt a great sense of threat.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The destructing energy easily penetrated through the Redemption Armor and worked on Luo Zheng's body. Even if Luo Zheng's body was strong enough to endure the attack, he still got hurt by the energy and got a wound.</p>

  <p>Seeing the spectacle, Yazid sneered and said, "If you can't withstand it, then don't push yourself too hard. If you can't go to the Floating Island, you will still have a chance in the future. It will be a pity if you're killed though."</p>

  <p>Both Malloy and Bentley glared at Yazid coldly.</p>

  <p>The people of the sub-branches of the Han Clan were completely disappointed with Yazid, since despite being a top-rank True God, he attacked a proving godly warrior with his powerful token.</p>
