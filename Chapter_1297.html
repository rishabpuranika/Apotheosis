<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was enveloped by the bright silver light. He flew faster and higher with every passing minute.</p>

  <p>An invisible force pushed him away from the plane and towards the boundless sky.</p>

  <p>Living beings that were too powerful were usually excluded from the plane. But the Celestial Position warriors had probably used some kind of a secret technique to avoid the repelling force. It was like a person sinking into the water, not knowing how to swim and finding it difficult to overcome the buoyant force.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng ever had the urge to return to the great world in the future, he would probably have to master this secret technique.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the dark continents. At first, he could vaguely see lights from large cities like Cloudy City and Oracle City. But as he continued to fly upwards, the continents shrank in his field of vision.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he could look at the Divine Kingdom Continent and the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The sound of the wind mixed with a metallic noise gave rise to strong gales that assaulted him.</p>

  <p>These all-conquering gales, however, couldn't cause any damage to Luo Zheng right now. The bright silver light had formed a special protective layer.</p>

  <p>Normal attacks would only pierce through his body, without causing any damage to him.</p>

  <p>Once he passed through the layer of gales, Luo Zheng continued to rise.</p>

  <p>He had already experienced this when he had practiced the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>But at the time, he had relied on the gravitational force of the stars to activate his perception to soar. And now, it was his physical body that was roaming the skies. This, however, was not his own strength. He was borrowing the power of the great world's repulsion.</p>

  <p>As he drew further and further away from the great world, his connection with it also grew weaker. A thought suddenly struck him at this.</p>

  <p>In the great world, he could freely transfer his power to any place in the world. But would he still be able to do it now that he had left the great world?</p>

  <p>Possessing the miraculous ability of transferring power made Luo Zheng invincible in this plane. No matter how strong the power was, it couldn't do any substantive damage to Luo Zheng, unless the power was so great that even the entire great world could not hold it in. The great world would be destroyed if the power were to be that strong.</p>

  <p>But would he still be able to do that after leaving the great world?</p>

  <p>As he thought this, Luo Zheng tried to transfer his power but in vain. He smiled wryly. The transfer of power was no longer effective.</p>

  <p>He had lost this important ability after he had left the great world.</p>

  <p>He felt a pang of regret but quickly recovered and became calm. After all, the transfer of power hadn't been his own ability, but was something that he had borrowed from the great world.</p>

  <p>For martial artists, their own strength was the most important. They could be strong for a while by relying on external force, but it wouldn't last long. If Luo Zheng relied too much on this ability, it would be difficult for him to fully cultivate.</p>

  <p>But though he couldn't transfer power, the memories of the great world still existed in his mind. He still maintained a faint connection with the great world, and could also look up events that had happened in the past as well as those that were happening in the present.</p>

  <p>So even after leaving this plane, Luo Zheng was still able to observe what Ning Yudie and the others were doing.</p>

  <p>His physical body didn't travel as fast as his perception, and he was slower now than when he ascended through the Dragon Soar Arena. He was like a leaf floating in the vast universe, drifting along with the wind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had maintained the same posture for a few days.</p>

  <p>He had already seen the universe and the scenery it had to offer dozens of times. Now, he closed his eyes and observed the happenings in the Cloud Hall through the memories of the great world.</p>

  <p>He saw Ning Yudie sitting in the Ice Palace, looking up at the sky dazedly - a sight that made his heart ache.</p>

  <p>He also saw the seriousness on Aura's face as she practiced meticulously.</p>

  <p>But where was Mu Ning? Why couldn't Luo Zheng see her?</p>

  <p>He sent this thought into the memories, but he was unable to find any trace of her throughout the great world.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Mu Ning to ascend at her cultivation level. There was only one explanation for her absence: she had already gone to the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>But why did she go to the Purple Power World?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was confused. Mu Ning had begun to speak hesitatingly ever since the old man from the Celestial Position had paid a visit. She must have been hiding something from him.</p>

  <p>He thought for a long time and when he still couldn't figure it out, Luo Zheng had no choice but to let it go. Although she was obedient in front of him, she was born with stubborn willfulness and he had no control over what she wanted to do.</p>

  <p>It took him a full month to ascend all the way up.</p>

  <p>A month later, Zheng's light suddenly dispersed and he rushed into a large black hole at a high speed. Just as he passed through the large hole, a loud noise sounded from above him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The sound rose to a deafening pitch, screeching through Zheng's ears and almost causing him to faint. His mind went blank.</p>

  <p>He gradually recovered consciousness and once he was completely awake, he found that he was lying in a square well.</p>

  <p>The clear water in the well was suffused with a light blue glow. The water was so clear that Luo Zheng could see the bottom. He felt a strange sense of comfort as he soaked in the clear blue water.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was not alone. There were quite a few other people in the well.</p>

  <p>And just like Luo Zheng, they appeared to be clueless as to their whereabouts.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sized them up. All of them were at the Soul Sea Realm, but it looked like they had just reached the realm. Their strength was far from that of Turner and War King Wind of the Divine Kingdom Continent. They were even weaker than the three leaders of the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng guessed that they had also flown here.</p>

  <p>And they had chosen to ascend as soon as they reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>As the ascending passage in the Divine Kingdom Continent had been destroyed, many of the Soul Sea Realm powerhouses couldn't ascend. In such a long period of time, all of them had reached the middle stage or even the later stage of the Soul Sea Realm. These warriors who had just reached the Soul Sea Realm were much weaker than them.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Upper World?" a warrior asked curiously after observing the well for a long time.</p>

  <p>Another person nodded and replied, "It should be. But what about this square well?"</p>

  <p>The others merely shook their heads.</p>

  <p>In a corner, a girl wearing plain clothes said, "If I'm not mistaken, I think this is the Ascending Well."</p>

  <p>"The Ascending Well?" the others asked in union.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded and continued, "I've heard that some of the Upper World's sacred places would use the Ascending Well to bring warriors from all over the universe. And I think this is that Ascending Well. I just don't know which human sacred place we have ascended to."</p>

  <p>"Must it be a human sacred place? What if it's another race's sacred place?" a bearded man asked, eyebrows raised slightly.</p>

  <p>The plain-clothed girl answered him, "It can't be, because there is a mysterious between link among different members of the same race. But I've also heard that there were indeed situations where warriors ascended into other races' supreme worlds. For example, if a human sacred place has just been taken away by the ogres, and we have ascended to this place, I'm afraid-" she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of what?" a tall, thin warrior prompted.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled faintly and said, "We will have no chance of survival if we fall into the hands of the ogres."</p>

  <p>The others were taken aback at her words.</p>

  <p>In the Lower World, only top-level powerhouses could reach the Soul Sea Realm and ascend to the Upper World. They had impatiently chosen to leave the Lower World because they were eager to realize their ambitions. They wanted to reach higher realms and pursue supreme martial arts.</p>

  <p>But they would be doomed if they ascended into the wrong places, or even fell into the hands of the ogres or other cruel races.</p>

  <p>All of them were afraid - afraid of dying before they could even achieve something.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled at their expressions. "Don't be afraid. This rarely happens. Our luck isn't that bad!" Her gaze landed on Luo Zheng once she had finished speaking. How could he only have the cultivation of the Life and Death Realm?</p>
