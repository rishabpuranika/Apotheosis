  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally spoke as he wielded the four swords with his mind.</p>

  <p>He shouted angrily, "I know you just want to kill me! Don't try to give excuses. Everyone knows how unreasonable you are. I beat your sister in the Arena of Legends that day, so you're just standing up for her now.</p>

  <p>But don't you think trying to kill me is too much? And if you really want to kill me, then what option do I have other than to fight back?"</p>

  <p>This was the most dangerous situation Luo Zheng had found himself in after entering the divine land.</p>

  <p>At this moment, countless ideas popped into his mind.</p>

  <p>If he just ruthlessly fought back, it would arouse everyone's suspicion of him and make it seem like Rachelle was right. If he merely stood there and argued with her, the results wouldn't be much different. She wasn't one to be swayed by words and would still try to kill him.</p>

  <p>However, he thought that if he argued while resisting her attacks, he might be able to turn the situation around.</p>

  <p>"My sister?" Just like Luo Zheng had expected, Rachelle froze. She didn't understand what Luo Zheng was talking about. Why was Nelly suddenly involved in this?</p>

  <p>"I defeated Nelly and humiliated her. So being a narrow-minded woman, you are not willing to let me go," Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>His words actually didn't make sense at all. Instead of refuting Rachelle's claims, he was attacking her with a ridiculous claim of his own. But the more he acted like this, the more convincing he was.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Rachelle was notorious for her narrow-mindedness. Even though her personality had nothing to do with her current accusation about Luo Zheng, the other True Gods couldn't help but take it into account after hearing his words.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Luo Zheng had started fighting back.</p>

  <p>There was no time to logically think about the matter and so they all subconsciously stood on Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>If they thought about it carefully, they would realize that Luo Zheng was talking nonsense. But right now, most people believed that Rachelle had a crazy hidden agenda for trying to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even Nelly was a little confused after hearing Luo Zheng's words. She was indeed unhappy that she had been defeated by him. Like her sister, she was a very proud woman with a strong character. She couldn't let her sister teach Luo Zheng a lesson on her behalf.</p>

  <p>"Father! Tianxing is not just a member of the Han Clan, but he's also a genius. Rachelle is going to kill him just because he defeated her sister!</p>

  <p>Please help him!" Kelsey said worriedly.</p>

  <p>She didn't know anything about the situation, so she unconditionally believed Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the only ones who realized that Luo Zheng was talking nonsense were Liusu and Aleyna, who both knew Luo Zheng very well. But now, in order to save him, Liusu chipped in, "Master Alfredo, Tianxing has made a great contribution to our clan. As the head of the clan, are you going to stand aside and let Rachelle kill him over such a trifle?"</p>

  <p>"Liusu is right. The ranking of our clan has gone up all because of Tianxing. As the head of the clan, how can you refuse to help him?" Aleyna added.</p>

  <p>Alfredo kept silent. He didn't know what to say or do.</p>

  <p>Putting everything else aside, Luo Zheng was from the Floating Island of the Han Clan, which meant that he was a member of their clan. What the three girls said made sense.</p>

  <p>However, Alfredo stood there hesitantly as he was unwilling to get involved in this fight.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The invisible sword in the front shot toward Rachelle.</p>

  <p>The power contained in this huge sword was by no means something that even a consummate True God could ignore.</p>

  <p>However, Rachelle was wearing a careless expression, as if she knew she wouldn't get hurt.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, the strength source combined with the illusory sword was indeed powerful, but it all depended on who was wielding it.</p>

  <p>If it were Joy who was controlling the four swords, Rachelle would have no chance of fighting back. But even though Luo Zheng was controlling so much strength source, he could only crassly turn it into four huge swords. It was difficult for him to even transform the illusory sword into the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this kind of simple and violent attack would have a miraculous effect when fighting a top-rank True God, but it was nothing when it came to a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Rachelle dodged the overhead strike with just one small movement.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had also taken her reaction into account. The moment she dodged the strike, another huge sword followed her and horizontally slashed toward her from another direction.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, Rachelle took a light step up in the air and floated upward.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze froze. He sent the last two swords flying toward Rachelle.</p>

  <p>This time, the two swords actually forced her into a corner. If she couldn't rush out, she might really be killed by him.</p>

  <p>"You have a good mind, brat," Rachelle said with a smile.</p>

  <p>In a bid to avoid contact with the swords, she curled her body up to the extreme.</p>

  <p>A split second later, she disappeared and then appeared behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a consummate True God, she could use spatial transference as freely as she wanted.</p>

  <p>Although she had a casual smile on her face, her eyes were full of murderous intent.</p>

  <p>The difference in strength between the two of them was too great.</p>

  <p>Without the help of those four giant swords, it would be hard for Luo Zheng to even deal with Soren, a top-rank True God, let alone Rachelle, one of the best consummate True Gods in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The scene looked more like a cat playing with a mouse than two warriors fighting against each other. Luo Zheng had no room to fight back. Even the sword Rachelle was casually wielding was not something he could avoid now.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The four swords turned around and hacked at Rachelle who was now behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the strength source within the four swords was weakened very quickly. Now, half of the strength source had been used up. Using the swords to attack was only a form and could do nothing to Rachelle.</p>

  <p>"Stop struggling," said Rachelle indifferently. She didn't even need to dodge the four swords, and the scarlet sword in her hand kept waving wildly.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, she launched four strikes.</p>

  <p>Every sword of Luo Zheng's was slashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>After the four swords dispersed, Rachelle waved her sword for the fifth time.</p>

  <p>This casual sword strike was more than enough to take Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>But just as she was about to launch her strike, a middle-aged man in lavish clothes appeared beside her and reached out his hand, which had a metallic luster.</p>

  <p>He gently pinched her sword with his thumb, index finger, and middle finger.</p>

  <p>Although his hand stopped her sword, the blood-red sword light didn't stop. It spread, ruthlessly hitting the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>Clank!</p>

  <p>After a moment, save for the crisp sound, there was no trace of the sword light, and his hand was completely intact.</p>

  <p>"Stop it, Rachelle," Troy said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Why did you stop me?" Rachelle asked coldly.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Alfredo quietly appeared behind her and said, "No matter where Tianxing came from, he is still a member of our Han Clan. It won't be too late to make a decision after things are clear!"</p>

  <p>Under the persuasion of the three girls of the Han Clan, Alfredo had been hesitating about whether he should stop Rachelle. The truth was, he personally didn't like Luo Zheng and didn't care about whether he lived or died.</p>

  <p>But now that Troy had come forward, as the head of the Han Clan, Alfredo would seem cold-blooded if he didn't do anything.</p>

  <p>Troy glanced at Alfredo with disdain in his eyes before turning back to Rachelle. "As you said, there is indeed something that doesn't add up about this guy's background. But whatever it is, he was chosen by the Holy Emperor of our Dongfang Clan. It won't be too late to deal with him after we find out his true origins. There's no need to rush to kill him!"</p>

  <p>In Troy's eyes, Luo Zheng was just a fish on a chopping board. No matter what, he would not be able to escape. Why did Rachelle have to kill him in such a hurry?</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," Rachelle said expressionlessly as she pulled her sword out of Troy's hand.</p>

  <p>However, the moment she pulled out the sword, murderous intent flashed in her eyes. The blood-red light on the sword spun madly, turning into a blood awl before shooting toward Luo Zheng's head once again.</p>
