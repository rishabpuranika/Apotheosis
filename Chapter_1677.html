<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the Heaven Earth Board, Luo Luo Zheng was being treated like a punching bag.</p>

  <p>He was being swung back and forth by Cindy's invisible force, but he was powerless to resist.</p>

  <p>The truth was, he still had a lot of tricks up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>However, in the Emerald Dream, the Thunderbolt Annihilation and the Stellar Body didn't work at all.</p>

  <p>Just now, when Luo Luo Zheng had seen Cindy block his spear attack with just her fingertip, he'd already realized that no matter how powerful he was, it would be impossible for him to defeat his opponent in the Emerald Dream.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the two of them weren't really fighting. Instead, they were in a dream.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, Luo Luo Zheng had been drawn into Cindy's dream.</p>

  <p>He had never heard of the Dream Divine Dao, which was one of the 3, 000 Divine Dao. However, he had heard that somewhere in the universe, there was some kind of dream killing technique. With that technique, a martial artist could quietly sneak into one's dream and kill him.</p>

  <p>The world in the dream could be anything because it was completely built by the martial artist's thoughts.</p>

  <p>Now, Cindy was the goddess of the Emerald Dream.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Luo Luo Zheng was, he could never be a match for her as long as they were here.</p>

  <p>The key was to leave the Emerald Dream.</p>

  <p>Trapping Luo Luo Zheng in the Emerald Dream was undoubtedly an extremely powerful technique. However, if Luo Luo Zheng managed to leave the dream, it would be extremely easy for him to fight back and even defeat Cindy.</p>

  <p>'The dream killing technique... The Dream Divine Dao...</p>

  <p>This is her dream, not mine.</p>

  <p>So how did she draw me into her dream?' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Dreams were a series of images, events, and feelings that happened in one's mind when he or she was asleep.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, no one could determine what he or she would dream about.</p>

  <p>However, it was a common notion that whatever one thought about during the day, that was what they would dream of at night. Dreams often reflected real life.</p>

  <p>'So I was stealthily drawn into the Emerald Dream?</p>

  <p>What did she say to me before she drew me here?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered inwardly.</p>

  <p>"Hello.</p>

  <p>Do you like peach blossoms?"</p>

  <p>Yes! Peach blossoms! He remembered it now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Cindy had used peach blossoms as a guide to pull him into her dream.</p>

  <p>Now, in the Emerald Dream, there were countless peach blossoms floating slowly around them. They were a beautiful sight to behold.</p>

  <p>These peach blossoms were the base of the dream, making Luo Luo Zheng unable to wake up.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Another heavy blow from Cindy directly slammed Luo Luo Zheng onto the edge of the Heaven Earth Board before he heavily rebounded backward.</p>

  <p>With his new train of thought, Luo Luo Zheng had given up resisting.</p>

  <p>After all, he knew that he could not dodge Cindy's attacks.</p>

  <p>If he increased his strength, Cindy would do the same. If he moved fast, she would also follow suit.</p>

  <p>As he flew backward, his gaze quietly swept over her.</p>

  <p>Peach blossoms...</p>

  <p>The peach blossoms floated down and covered the ground.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, there was a circular space around Cindy where there was not even a single peach blossom. The peach blossoms floated down, but none of them landed within that space.</p>

  <p>But not all the peach blossoms were the same.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly caught a glimpse of a small peach blossom on top of Cindy's bun.</p>

  <p>Before he'd been brought into the Emerald Dream, there had been no peach blossom on her bun, but now, there was one.</p>

  <p>'This must be the key, ' Luo Luo Zheng decided.</p>

  <p>A strange look appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>'If I cut off this peach blossom, I will be able to leave the Emerald Dream, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>However, the Dream Divine Dao couldn't be so easily broken.</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances, he decided to do something. After all, he'd never been one to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He was trying to find an opportunity to spring into action after being hit by so many heavy punches.</p>

  <p>There was only one chance for him. If he failed, then with Cindy's speed in the Emerald Dream, he wouldn't be able to catch up.</p>

  <p>Cindy reached out her slender hand, and an irresistible force hooked onto Luo Luo Zheng and dragged him, sending him flying toward her.</p>

  <p>Huff?</p>

  <p>"Alright, time to end it," Cindy said with a charming smile.</p>

  <p>Still being controlled by the invisible force, Luo Luo Zheng floated to the spot right in front of Cindy.</p>

  <p>"Your physical body is indeed very special," she said. "I have to say, it is as strong as a first-rank divine weapon. If it were Lucille who had to fight you, it might have given her a headache, but unfortunately, you met me first."</p>

  <p>When Cindy mentioned her name, Lucille blinked. She looked down at the immobilized Luo Luo Zheng and felt a slight pang of regret in her heart.</p>

  <p>She was a big fan of Luo Zheng's stories. However, she had lost to him once before, so she wanted to defeat him personally. Otherwise, she would regret it until the end of her days.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it seemed that Luo Luo Zheng was going to lose to Cindy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you fool!" Lucille said with a sigh. "Just cut off the peach blossom on the back of her head." Cindy's Dream Divine Dao was extremely powerful, but she'd been defeated in the competition of the four clans by Lawson and Nathan.</p>

  <p>The reason for this was simple: the four clans shared information about one another, and they were very clear about everyone's skills.</p>

  <p>Cindy's Dream Divine Dao was indeed powerful, but it was like a special mystery. As long as her opponent could not solve the mystery, she would be invincible. However, if her opponent succeeded in solving the mystery, the power of the Dream Divine Dao would be greatly weakened.</p>

  <p>Lucille and the others knew this very well, so Cindy would never be able to defeat them.</p>

  <p>However, people who didn't know how the Dream Divine Dao worked would have no chance of winning against Cindy.</p>

  <p>A faint blush appeared on her face. With a sweet smile, she squeezed lightly.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>In an instant, Luo Zheng's right arm broke off from his body, and blood gushed out from the wound.</p>

  <p>Outside of the dream, Cindy was a young girl who always remained indoors.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, she was wearing an abnormally cruel expression.</p>

  <p>As she looked at the gurgling blood, her eyes lit up even more.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect her to be so cruel in her dream," Nathan said with a hint of sarcasm as he rolled his eyes.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, his clan had wanted to pair him off with Cindy.</p>

  <p>She was stunning and talented, and generally thought to be a good match for Nathan. However, Nathan was an eccentric person and he'd known Cindy's true nature from the beginning, so he had refused.</p>

  <p>Although she looked shy and delicate, she was actually bloodthirsty.</p>

  <p>However, the desire for bloodshed in her dream and that in reality were two different things. She could kill people in her dream, but when the Emerald Dream was gone, they would still be completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>However, their souls would have been shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>Cindy gently tore Luo Zheng's other arm, and the pain he felt was indescribable.</p>

  <p>His body had always been strong. Being torn apart by Cindy was probably the most serious injury he had ever received.</p>

  <p>Despite the pain, he clenched his teeth as his gaze quietly shifted to the peach blossom on the back of Cindy's head.</p>

  <p>At the moment, he was only two steps away from Cindy. As long as Cindy didn't realize that he had noticed the peach blossom, he would still have a chance.</p>

  <p>Cindy raised her head to look at Luo Luo Zheng and smiled charmingly once again.</p>

  <p>"Actually, you can admit defeat. I'm very kind. I can't bear to see others shed tears or bleed."</p>

  <p>Enduring the pain, Luo Luo Zheng forced a smile. "As a martial artist, there's no avoiding blood. But I won't cry!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" Cindy pouted like a child. "But I really want to see you cry."</p>

  <p>After saying that, she made another slanted gesture with her finger.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>It was as if the sharpest sword had cut into Luo Zheng's leg.</p>

  <p>It forcefully separated his right leg from his body.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Even though she knew that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't die in the Illusion Battlefield, Mu Ning couldn't bear to watch such a bloody scene and angrily shouted on the stone.</p>

  <p>The more Cindy wanted to torture him, the calmer his expression became.</p>

  <p>Cindy took great pleasure in torturing her opponents in her dream, and this was obvious to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>So, he decided to put on a show and let her know that although he was powerless to fight back, he would be unyielding to her.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his real goal was the peach blossom on her bun.</p>

  <p>"Once again!"</p>

  <p>Cindy's finger lightly made a slanting gesture in the air again, separating Luo Zheng's other leg from his body as well.</p>

  <p>The audience couldn't help but shake their heads.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, although Luo Luo Zheng was quite famous, he was not as powerful as Cindy. He was basically powerless to fight back in the face of ace talents of influential clans.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of the battle, he had not fought back effectively.</p>

  <p>In fact, the vast majority of people in the universe didn't know that this was the Emerald Dream and couldn't understand how Cindy had become so powerful.</p>
