<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a dull thud when Luo Luo Zheng landed on the board, which meant that the black stone landed on the board as well.</p>

  <p>Nathan had also landed on the board, so the white stone had landed too.</p>

  <p>Their movements caused a series of new, fascinating moves on the board. After the white stone had landed, it connected with the other white stones and the situation was quickly reversed.</p>

  <p>The "dragon" that black stones had destroyed a while ago now appeared again.</p>

  <p>In addition, Nathan's stone was the icing on the cake.</p>

  <p>"What a move! It seems that you are destined to lose this battle," Nathan said with a smile. "And look over there."</p>

  <p>He stretched out a finger and pointed towards a few stones. "Mu Ning played all those stones. They were originally blocked off from each other, but now they're interconnected and have formed the trend of love, whose target is me."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that this man wouldn't be saying anything good. He couldn't see any sign of the trend of love at all!</p>

  <p>"And then?" Luo Luo Zheng asked indifferently. He almost rolled his eyes, but Nathan swelled with pride.</p>

  <p>Nathan then answered, "My fate is to be guided by the heavens. I don't know if you understand the logic behind it, but these fate deductions will happen and I will definitely make history. As the saying goes, the trend of the heavens is irresistible; those who submit will prosper, and those who resist shall perish. You won't be able to resist it."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His hand went behind him and drew out the spear. The spear's tip suddenly trembled and stirred non-stop. "If you know your situation and what to do, then you clearly shouldn't make things difficult for Mu Ning."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face couldn't help but twitch. 'This guy is so shameless!' he thought. Suddenly, his train of thought was interrupted by a shouting voice.</p>

  <p>"Hey! I don't know you, so stay away from Luo Luo Zheng and me!" Opposite them was Mu Ning, whose face was red with anger.</p>

  <p>Nathan had been acting really weird since she first met him, but she could let that slide. However, he was now advising Luo Luo Zheng to leave her.</p>

  <p>She could tolerate some of his issues, but the fact that Nathan had actually asked Luo Luo Zheng to leave her made her burst her bubble. "You think that the heavens are on your side, and no one will stop you. But I'm Luo Zheng's wife. Stop drooling over me! You think I'll fall in love with you? Ha-ha!</p>

  <p>What nonsense are you talking about? The universe is so big, but I'm afraid it won't be able to make up for your empty brain."</p>

  <p>As a woman, Mu Ning knew how to bicker with others. She wasn't this sharp-tongued before, but she had stayed with a group of women for a long time back when she had practiced in the Apeiron Tower. Her time there had made her much wittier.</p>

  <p>The martial artists from countless supreme worlds who were watching them instantly burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>Nathan could be considered a Mr. Right for many women, but being ridiculed by Mu Ning truly burned his face off in embarrassment. He was indeed on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p>

  <p>Once again, he fell into a state of doubt. He doubted his own charms and lost his self-confidence.</p>

  <p>Nathan's warrior spirit was supported by his absolute confidence. He believed that if he wanted something, he would be able to have it and he would definitely succeed. There was nothing in the universe that he could not do with all his efforts.</p>

  <p>But now, just Margaret's words dealt a heavy blow to his mentality. It was even worse than the blow when he had witnessed the fight between Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>"I...I was telling the truth. This is our fate," Nathan managed to say. For the first time, he lost his confidence in front of a woman.</p>

  <p>"Are you an idiot? Did you know what you said made me unhappy?</p>

  <p>Besides, this is only your deduction, and it won't happen in the end,"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning sneered.</p>

  <p>Nathan remained silent. It wasn't that he didn't have any words to refute her, but rather, he didn't know what to say when he saw the excitement on her face.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning felt that he wouldn't say anything else, she snorted coldly and turned to face Luo Luo Zheng with a sweet smile. "Honey, I'll be rooting for you."</p>

  <p>Her words dripped sweetly off her lips like honey, and the crowd could tell that she loved Luo Luo Zheng very much.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie couldn't help but feel her skin crawl when she heard Mu Ning call Luo Luo Zheng "honey." The feeling of loss further intensified as she sulked quietly in the Pure Jade Sacred Palace.</p>

  <p>She wasn't jealous of Margaret's achievements, but the fact that she could stand beside Luo Luo Zheng. Ning Yudie gently bit her bottom lip as her face gradually twisted into a miserable frown.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly at Mu Ning and nodded at her.</p>

  <p>Then, he raised the broken sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>After this battle, the sword would be returned to Lone.</p>

  <p>However, a violent gale unexpectedly swept across Luo Zheng's face just as he had raised his sword. The gale was strong and vigorous, and Luo Luo Zheng felt as if he was smashed with a large rock on the head.</p>

  <p>It was Nathan attacking him!</p>

  <p>He probably rushed like that because Margaret's words provoked him.</p>

  <p>In terms of speed, Nathan was slightly slower than Tianming. But this time, he jumped up and dove over. He didn't aim the spear in his hand straight ahead, but smashed it down instead.</p>

  <p>He hit down hard without hesitation as the spear's tip glinted sharply under the light.</p>

  <p>"Just how much do you hate me?" Luo Luo Zheng was almost speechless.</p>

  <p>A white mist appeared around his body and with a slight shake, he circulated the Eight Smoky Melodies and easily dodged Nathan's sudden attack.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The spearhead was only two fingers wide and three inches long.</p>

  <p>Yet, the impact of the strike was far from weak.</p>

  <p>The ground where Luo Luo Zheng stood just now had caved in and formed a huge crater, which continued to spread to the surrounding area.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had long since floated to the other side of the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Nathan raised his spear high as he moved quickly like a shuttle. He swiftly flew forward as he dragged numerous afterimages behind him; then he closed in on Luo Luo Zheng and thrust out his spear once more.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng paid him no mind and circled around the spear once. This time, however, he didn't dodge. Instead, he closed in on Nathan, and simultaneously swung his sword at Nathan's head.</p>

  <p>In turn, Nathan quickly lowered himself to avoid Luo Zheng's attack. He then turned the spear around so that its long end would strike towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If it was an ordinary martial artist who were in Luo Zheng's place, they would probably be cut into half.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Luo Luo Zheng snorted coldly.</p>

  <p>An immense force within his hand erupted, and he didn't choose to dodge.</p>

  <p>Nathan fought like a madman as he drowned Luo Luo Zheng in a barrage of head-on attacks. However, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't afraid of anyone in close combat.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound as Luo Zheng's fist, which was filled with the power of dragon scales, landed straight on the spear's end.</p>

  <p>It was true that Nathan's spear technique was strong. From the looks of it, he seemed like a spear expert. Since his spear bounced back, he used the window of opportunity to turn it around and aim it at Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>His spear was extremely long and narrow. If Luo Luo Zheng had gotten hit, it would feel like a cut from a blade. Furthermore, Nathan's spear was a supreme divine weapon after all. It would really hurt Luo Luo Zheng badly if the spear were to hit him.</p>

  <p>Of course, Nathan was unhappy and naturally wanted to vent his anger out on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He didn't care if this method could deal with Luo Luo Zheng or not. What was important was he would get to release his anger. Right now.</p>

  <p>Yet before the spear could pierce Luo Luo Zheng, the broken sword in Luo Zheng's hand suddenly swung by itself and pushed away the spear. The strong impact also pushed Nathan back a little.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately took advantage of Nathan's minor setback, and threw a punch straight at his face.</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't expect the punch at all. He was caught off-guard and hit the corner of the board. He floated in the air for a long while before he slowly slid back down on the board.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had undoubtedly used a great deal of strength which had sent Nathan flying, but the man wasn't injured. Luo Luo Zheng was amazed. 'He seems like he has steel tendons and bones of iron. I wonder what kind of physique he has, ' he thought.</p>
