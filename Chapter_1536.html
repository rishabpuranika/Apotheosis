<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The giant golden Buddha could've just let Luo Zheng go.</p>

  <p>However, he was too curious about him to do that.</p>

  <p>This young man had relied on his own strength and went past all the eighteen arhats. This was someone who was worth attention.</p>

  <p>Once Soul Sea Realm warriors opened up their Soul Seas, their life vitality would liquefy, turn into seawater, and get stored in their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>This way, a Soul Sea Realm warrior would be able to store huge, but still limited, life vitality in their bodies.</p>

  <p>The size of a warrior's Soul Sea was limited.</p>

  <p>The golden Buddha had previously deduced that Luo Zheng would only be able to use the Gods-intimidating Strike twice, at most.</p>

  <p>One strike would've already consumed more than half of his life vitality.</p>

  <p>A second one would dry up his entire Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>Despite being more talented than other people, Zheng's Soul Sea still wouldn't be limitless. His capacity was just naturally limited.</p>

  <p>Not even a second Soul Sea would help him. In fact, it would only add one measly sword strike to his limit.</p>

  <p>This would mean a total of three strikes. It was worth noting that, in this universe, anyone who could summon the Gods-intimidating Strike four times would already be considered as one of the most powerful figures amongst the major forces.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng was someone who continuously defied conventional expectations. He hadn't used two, or three, not even four strikes.  Luo Zheng Luo stood there calmly and released seventeen sword strikes against his enemies.</p>

  <p>To say that the golden Buddha was shocked was an understatement.</p>

  <p>There was just no way! This young man had just done the impossible.</p>

  <p>Did he perhaps have a treasure that could instantly replenish the life vitality in his body? Maybe he practiced some sort of magical skill that enabled him to constantly extract life vitality from somewhere? But if he had done so, the golden Buddha would've surely noticed.</p>

  <p>Curious about how this young man managed to do this, the golden Buddha quickly activated the golden light hidden within the four arhats.</p>

  <p>The golden Buddha wasn't the first to doubt Luo Zheng like this. Gus, whom the young man had run into a few years ago, also had the same reservations.</p>

  <p>The only reason why Gus was able to go beyond his doubts was because of his faith in his master and the rigorous conditions his master required in accepting a disciple.</p>

  <p>Zheng's chaotic sea, which was incomparable to the sea of life vitality, was thus quickly noticed by Gus.</p>

  <p>The golden Buddha was perfectly aware of the existence of chaotic energy. It could be considered the energy of origin for all living beings, though, at the same time, it was also the energy of death. Chaotic energy was poison for all living things and anyone, except perhaps a great avatar, would die with a single touch.</p>

  <p>Thus it never entered the Buddha's mind that Luo Zheng might have the chaotic sea within him.</p>

  <p>After all, he couldn't even imagine someone actually mastering or even attempting to comprehend the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was in a state of frustration. The Taming Dragon Arhats were quick to regenerate and he was running out of options to keep them down.</p>

  <p>His rate of chaotic energy consumption was by no means fast and he was still able to smash his opponents to pieces, but the arhats were quick to reform and regenerate by means of the golden light.</p>

  <p>Would this process of reform and regeneration ever end?</p>

  <p>One last time!</p>

  <p>He knew he couldn't give up and it wasn't in his nature to not exhaust his resources in dealing with his problems.</p>

  <p>Despite the strong force behind his strike, the stone pieces continued to reform although the cracks noticeably remained on their bodies.</p>

  <p>This time, just as they were on the verge of once again forming together, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword's sword intent flickered once more.</p>

  <p>"Break now!"</p>

  <p>"Puff puff puff puff..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng released ten consecutive strikes, shattering the arhats into pieces.</p>

  <p>But, just as before, the stone pieces once again glowed golden.</p>

  <p>"Again?"</p>

  <p>His expression dimmed, as he realized that the golden light would really drive him crazy if he didn't do something.</p>

  <p>As the golden light glowed brighter, Zheng's mind was quickly doing its work trying to figure out a solution.</p>

  <p>And suddenly, as if there was a ping in his brain, Luo Zheng quickly whipped his head and gazed at the exit.</p>

  <p>There was a hidden meaning in his gaze as he zeroed in on the exit, or rather, what hid behind it.</p>

  <p>The golden Buddha was startled upon noticing Zheng's sudden change in behaviour.</p>

  <p>"This guy is keen and observant. He hasn't seen me but he already knows I'm here. This is the last time. If I am still unable to test your limits then I will stop," the golden Buddha muttered to himself indifferently.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng already had too much.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!" he screamed and wisps of white mist quickly spread from Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The arhats had since reformed and stood tall once again.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how strong they were, they soon realized that they couldn't get within three inches around Zheng's body. They were well-coordinated and in sync with each other but, no matter what, they just couldn't seem to catch Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter the strength of their fists and the violent nature of their attacks, they could do nothing with the way Luo Zheng dodged and easily swam through their strikes like a slimy fish in the ocean.</p>

  <p>The tables had turned and it was now the arhats who were feeling the frustration of not being able to hit Luo Zheng. Meanwhile, the young man was relaxed and floated in the air as if he was in water, merely being pushed around by the current of his opponents' attacks.</p>

  <p>He would time and again look at the adytum's gate and sneer mockingly at whatever or whoever was there.</p>

  <p>"You want to play, huh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's actions left the golden Buddha speechless, and also a bit impressed.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he was unworthy of testing this man's limits, the golden Buddha finally pinched the incense, extinguishing the source of the four arhats' power.</p>

  <p>"Creak!"</p>

  <p>As the four arhats were finally rendered immobile, the gate of the eighteenth adytum finally opened.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not waste any time and quickly headed for the exit.</p>

  <p>He thought he would have to spend a long time playing with the arhats.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that the person controlling them would give in that easily. He probably didn't want to make things difficult for Luo Zheng, or perhaps he had gotten bored and simply opened the door out of resignation.</p>

  <p>There was another adytum that greeted Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, there were no statues here, only a single altar in the middle.</p>

  <p>And in that altar was a white jade token that seemed to faintly glow in the light.</p>

  <p>"Is this the reward?" he muttered to himself, briefly looking at the token and noticing the word written on it.</p>

  <p>"Teleportation," he read. "It's a Teleportation Token?"</p>

  <p>Teleportation was only something like world lords could comprehend.</p>

  <p>It was only after reaching such a high level of cultivation and experiencing how to control an entire world would a warrior be able to comprehend the methods of spatial transference.</p>

  <p>And it was for good reason. Teleportation consumed life vitality extremely fast. An ordinary world lord would have to rest and replenish his or her life vitality after around four to five teleportations.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was an essential skill for world lords and above. The only way to travel through the 100, 000 supreme worlds after all was through either the help of extraordinary legendary beasts or teleportation.</p>

  <p>It was through teleportation that the Supreme Lords were able to get to the fairy palace back then.</p>

  <p>"With this Teleportation Token, can I teleport myself across the universe?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had spent 300, 000 Illusion Points in entering this cave so it was only natural that he had high hopes.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he thought the Teleportation Token he got was an equal exchange for the loss of so many Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>This was something that could solve an annoying problem he currently faced.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield Luo Zheng was in was divided into fifty supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>If he did not want to use a passageway, then crossing a supreme world was going to be very time-consuming and exhausting for him.</p>

  <p>However, this Teleportation Token changed things. With this, he would now be able to travel back and forth the supreme worlds with little effort.</p>

  <p>This thought made him very excited.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly grabbed the token and took another look at the ancient temple's depths.</p>

  <p>He could feel the presence of a number of powerful individuals within the inner court but he knew it was not in his authority to pry.</p>

  <p>After placing the token in the Sumeru Space, Luo Zheng quickly turned his heel and left.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stepped out, he was suddenly transported back to the outer courtyard where the little six-winged worm flickered into existence once again, as if waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but notice the smile that had replaced the worm's earlier vicious glare.</p>

  <p>He followed it on the path towards the entrance. The spinning lights were still there but Luo Zheng now found himself walking at ease which was a huge difference to how tense he was when he had first entered.</p>

  <p>Just as he reached the entrance, he heard a loud noise and a bit of a scuffle. From his position, he saw numerous Illusion Points at the mouth of the cave and the corpses of several warriors.</p>
