</p>

  <p>So, Zheng changed the topic and asked, "Roger, how many points can be exchanged for the queen's crystal core?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng ask such a silly question, Sun, who had not spoken for a long time, began to cough violently. He even had to thump his chest with his hands to stop the coughing! He turned to Zheng and asked incredulously, "Whoa, whoa, Zheng! You don't know?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged his shoulders, showing that he really knew nothing about it. Since he had never thought himself capable of getting the queen blade locust's crystal core, Zheng had never looked into it.</p>

  <p>"The queen blade locust's crystal core can be exchanged for a thousand points. So, you are going to have a small fortune," said Roger with a broad smile.</p>

  <p>"A small fortune ..." Zheng and Sun were both shocked when they heard Roger. A thousand points were equal to two thousand cubic crystals! In the entire Burning Sky Empire, no more than 50 clans, most of which were the noble clans, possessed 2, 000 cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>But to Roger, it was a small sum of money. Zheng and Sun couldn't help being in awe of Roger. They assumed that all children of noble clans were billionaires.</p>

  <p>"A thousand points is a lot of money. But it's not enough. I'll stay here and earn more points," said Zheng while looking at Roger.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng had initially sought to gain 100 points to get a ticket to visit his sister at Hell Mountain, but Zheng had changed his mind. He wanted to earn as many as possible by killing the greatest number of blade locusts.</p>

  <p>Saving Yan Luo from Hell Mountain would cost him a million points.</p>

  <p>And so far, Zheng had accumulated only about one-thousandth of what he needed.</p>

  <p>Hunting for blade locusts, especially the blade locust officers, was an excellent opportunity for Zheng to earn points. The insect aggression usually lasted two or three months every year. After this period, he would have no choice but to wait for the next year. Zheng didn't want to waste this opportunity.</p>

  <p>Roger and other people looked at Zheng in surprise. They didn't know why Zheng wanted to accumulate so many points. Did he want to exchange them for pills? Or did he want to exchange them for refining skills?</p>

  <p>Perhaps he wanted to swap them for magic weapons? For Zheng, at this stage, a thousand points were sufficient to exchange for anything he needed.</p>

  <p>"Are one thousand points not enough? Then how many is enough?" asked Sun.</p>

  <p>Zheng answered with a bitter smile, "Probably one million points."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Sun coughed violently again in fright.</p>

  <p>Even Martin, who knew little about Cloud Sect was frightened by the figure. He had interacted with several disciples of Cloud Sect, and he knew that the crystal core of a blade locust officer could be exchanged for one point. Zheng wanted to accumulate one million points, which was equivalent to hunting a million blade locust officers. The number was so unexpected. They were all scared by the figure Zheng quoted.</p>

  <p>Roger was stunned, too. After the shock wore off, he began to wonder why Zheng needed so many points, and what he wanted to do with them.</p>

  <p>A million points were equivalent to two million cubic crystals. It was a considerable sum of money even for a nobleman.</p>

  <p>Even at Cloud Sect, only a few treasures needed a million points to be redeemed.</p>

  <p>'Will he exchange them for a fairy weapon?</p>

  <p>No, he won't.' Roger knew that Zheng was only at the marrow refining level. Given his strength, he was unable to unleash the power of a fairy weapon. So he wouldn't be doing this for a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>'Does he want to earn a ticket to the Cloud Road?</p>

  <p>No, he doesn't.' It was true that he could walk on the Cloud Road by the use of a million points, but considering his current cultivation stage and his strength, he wouldn't pass the trial.</p>

  <p>'Is he going to save someone from Hell Mountain?'</p>

  <p>Roger felt that this inference was closer to the truth.</p>

  <p>Several people had been imprisoned in Hell Mountain. But most of them had been there for three or five years.</p>

  <p>A million points ... that meant that the person had been sentenced to a thousand years' imprisonment there.</p>

  <p>Could it be her?</p>

  <p>The girl whose talent no one could match? She had been sentenced to a thousand years of contemplation at Hell Mountain. Wasn't her surname Luo?</p>

  <p>Zheng Luo was her namesake. What was the relationship between them?</p>

  <p>Zheng was trying to accumulate a million points. That meant that he wanted to save her from Hell Mountain!</p>

  <p>So far, the results were clear. Roger was very confident of his inference.</p>

  <p>Although he hadn't seen her before, as the young master of the Meng Clan, he was aware of what was happening at Cloud sect, especially the important things.</p>

  <p>Roger couldn't help repressing a sigh of admiration.  Zheng Luo and Yan Luo were both geniuses, but it was a pity that they were not of noble birth and that they were always offending other people. Otherwise, Yan Luo wouldn't have been imprisoned in Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>Zheng had taken it for granted that he could save Yan Luo from Hell Mountain as long as he accumulated a million points. He was so naive.</p>

  <p>It was not quite as easy as that. But if Zheng could accumulate a million points and had the power to save Yan Luo from Hell Mountain, the Meng Clan could also give them a proper hand at the back.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's strength was the premise of everything. Meng Clan's assistance depended on whether Zheng had the ability to do so.</p>

  <p>That was what Roger thought about all this. He didn't realize that he was very concerned about Zheng. He said, "Since you are determined to stay here and continue to hunt for blade locusts, you must be careful about those people!"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and thanked him, "I will pay attention to them, and thank you for your help, Roger."</p>

  <p>Roger patted Zheng on the shoulder as a faint smile danced on his lips.</p>

  <p>Then he said, "Don't mention it. I hope you accumulate a million points as soon as possible and bring her out of Hell Mountain!"</p>

  <p>Zheng did a double take when he heard what Roger said. He had mentioned that he needed a million points. He hadn't said anything about Yan Luo.</p>

  <p>It was amazing that Roger was able to guess Zheng's purpose based on this detail!</p>

  <p>No wonder Roger was the elite figure in the Meng clan. He was brilliant!</p>
