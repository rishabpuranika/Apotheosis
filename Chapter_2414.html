<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Wang Clan was a vassal force of the Sword Clan in the Sunrest Tree Region.</p>

  <p>As one of the first-tier clans, the Wang Clan was quite famous and enjoyed a good reputation among the rest of the clans. For so many divine eras, they had been closely related to the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Rudolf's face darkened as he saw a young man of the Sword Clan jumping the queue with another person beside him.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Rufus said, "Isn't it inappropriate for a member of the Sword Clan to do so?"</p>

  <p>Noticing Hayden's clothes, both Rudolf and Rufus deduced that he belonged to the Sword Clan. However, they weren't sure who he was.</p>

  <p>After all, Hayden had recently taken over the position of the city lord, so only a few people were aware of it.</p>

  <p>"Rufus is right!"</p>

  <p>"Although the debate over the Godly Ways is presided over by the Sword Clan, you still have to be fair!"</p>

  <p>"I have been waiting in the line for a year and a half. Why should that person jump the queue?"</p>

  <p>The True Gods standing in the line appeared quite irritated.</p>

  <p>Hearing them complain, Hayden sneered, "Why? As the lord of the Famous Sword Divine City, I have the privilege to do so. If you don't accept this, then you can complain about it to the elders of your clan."</p>

  <p>"Are you the city lord?"</p>

  <p>"Since when did you become the lord of the Famous Sword Divine City?"</p>

  <p>Rufus and Rudolf had a confused expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>"He actually is the lord of the Famous Sword Divine City!"</p>

  <p>"At such a young age, he is able to rule a divine city!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods standing in the line were dumbstruck. Some of them covered their faces and hurried back to the queue, fearing that they would be noticed by the young city lord.</p>

  <p>Seeing everyone speechless, Hayden snorted and waved his hand at the three white robed True Gods guarding the array.</p>

  <p>They nodded as if to greet Hayden. Then, Hayden turned to Zheng and said with a smile, "Now it's your turn."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng walked towards the array.</p>

  <p>The array was quite ingenious. When the Truth Spiritual Swords floated up, Zheng sensed a tinge of power that spread out.</p>

  <p>But as he entered the array, the situation was different.</p>

  <p>With a sudden whoosh, an illusion obstructed Zheng's view, and he couldn't help but close his eyes.</p>

  <p>As the circular array changed its form, a long, narrow path appeared in front of him, and countless swords emerged from both sides of the path.</p>

  <p>"So many long swords?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were glittering with excitement. Then he started treading along the long path.</p>

  <p>He had only taken two steps.</p>

  <p>With a whooshing sound, the long swords on both sides of the path went for him.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?"</p>

  <p>A look of surprise appeared on Zheng's face. He whirled his body continuously to avoid the long swords.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had portrayed some extraordinary bodily movement skills, he was still unable to dodge the numerous swords completely.</p>

  <p>The swords lunged towards him.</p>

  <p>Some of them pierced through his body.</p>

  <p>All of this felt like an illusion to Zheng. His body quickly recovered after it was penetrated by the long swords. However, the pain was incomparably real, and he couldn't help but grimace.</p>

  <p>Outside the array, Rufus and Rudolf both gloated when they saw Zheng wearing a painful expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! He's said to be a distinguished guest, but he can't even find a Truth Spiritual Sword. He's quite worthless!"</p>

  <p>"He's not even qualified to serve me. City Lord, just look what your guest is doing. What a shame!"</p>

  <p>Rufus and Rudolf said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>However, Hayden appeared quite calm.</p>

  <p>He didn't inform Zheng intentionally about how to pass the array or the basic rules, and therefore Zheng wasn't able to deal with the situation with as much ease as Rufus did.</p>

  <p>He let this happen as he wanted to test Zheng's real potential.</p>

  <p>If Zheng couldn't get through the test, or if he had great difficulty and was barely qualified, he knew that he had to move on from Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the illusion, Zheng's body was still slashed by the long swords.</p>

  <p>'The first True God had a painful look and trembled all over as he was unable to avoid these swords.</p>

  <p>It's quite impossible for me to avoid these swords due to their density.</p>

  <p>Rufus must have a trick, or else he should have been unable to avoid them as well, '</p>

  <p>Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He was sure that he'd be able to dodge the swords with the help of the Truth of Cultivation Nature and Eight Smoky Melodies, but he didn't want to do so right now.</p>

  <p>"The first sword lifted by Rufus...</p>

  <p>All the swords look the same.</p>

  <p>Hayden said that the Truth of Godly Way contained in the Truth Spiritual Swords is a little stronger than that of the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>I see. He's testing me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes gleamed with excitement.</p>

  <p>He didn't try to dodge the swords, but rather let them penetrate his body.</p>

  <p>It was painful to be sliced by these swords, but it wasn't something Zheng couldn't bear.</p>

  <p>After his body was stabbed through by dozens of swords, Zheng's gaze slightly narrowed. "It's you!"</p>

  <p>A cracking sound was heard.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out and, in an instant, grabbed one of the countless long swords.</p>

  <p>This was the Truth Spiritual Sword!</p>

  <p>At the same time, one of the twenty-three Truth Spiritual Swords in the array suddenly buzzed and began to float. Its tip slowly started to spin towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He has caught the first sword and mastered the principle. It won't take him long to catch the rest of the swords, right?" Hayden said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"He only acquired the first sword. It's nothing out of the ordinary."</p>

  <p>"He's so slow. I would have caught the third Truth Spiritual Sword till now."</p>

  <p>Rufus and Rudolf mocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>They were unaware that Zheng was sent into the array by Hayden before he could even figure out the basic rules.</p>

  <p>After he obtained the first Truth Spiritual Sword, all the swords disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough."</p>

  <p>A victorious smile appeared on Zheng's face as he grabbed the Truth Spiritual Sword and continued to move forward.</p>

  <p>The principle of this array used by the Sword Clan was not complex. It was to create countless illusory long swords. The Truth of Godly Way contained in these swords was the same, coming from the momentum of the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>However, twenty three of them had been nurtured by the core of the Sunrest Tree, and therefore the Truth of Godly Way present in them was a bit more.</p>

  <p>Those who were sensitive to the Truth of Godly Way could easily differentiate between the twenty-three real swords and the fake ones.</p>

  <p>"It feels strange."</p>

  <p>Zheng felt something wasn't right after acquiring the first Truth Spiritual Sword.</p>

  <p>The Truth Spiritual Sword in his hand continued to vibrate violently, as if it was whining and wanted to break away from Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Hayden, the three True Gods in white, and the two brothers of the Wang Clan noticed it as well.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with this Truth Spiritual Sword?"</p>

  <p>"It seems like it wants to struggle to free itself from that man!"</p>

  <p>"This has never happened!"</p>

  <p>Hayden frowned. He couldn't comprehend what was going on. The Truth Spiritual Sword circling around Zheng seemed to be resisting him.</p>

  <p>"It's something out of the ordinary!"</p>

  <p>Zheng tightly gripped his Truth Spiritual Sword, giving it no chance to escape.</p>

  <p>He continued to walk forward.</p>

  <p>He had only taken a few steps when he was attacked by more Truth Spiritual Swords.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng knew how to react. He lowered his body, and with a flash, he had discerned the subtle differences in the swords with his keen senses.</p>

  <p>Then he stretched out his hand as fast as lightning and grabbed the second sword easily. Again, the dense swords disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, this sword also tried to break free of Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't pay any heed to it.</p>

  <p>He clutched the sword under his arm and dashed forward.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the third Truth Spiritual Sword appeared in his hand, and at the same time, a fork appeared in front of him, which was the way out of the array.</p>
