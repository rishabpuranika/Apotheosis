<br/><br/>

  

  <p>In Amos' eyes, it didn't matter how Zheng found the wild bone— all that mattered was Zheng was the one person he could bully at will.</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled out the wild bone, activating the space ring in his hand.</p>

  <p>Then, the huge wild bone entered the Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>Raising his head and throwing Amos a glance at the edge of the crater, Zheng flew up from the bottom.</p>

  <p>"You're a lucky man," Amos said as he stared back.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly in return. "It's truly luck."</p>

  <p>The latter's expression made Amos frown— was Zheng merely pretending to be calm or was he merely not as simple as he first seemed?</p>

  <p>Amos was a cruel man and after coming to the Immemorial Wilderness so often, he had already seen many people who would pretend to be fragile.</p>

  <p>But Zheng wasn't hiding his cultivation— he was indeed a newly formed Wild God without any particularly strong strength for support.</p>

  <p>To that thought, a ferocious expression surfaced on Amos' face. "It's not about luck. I brought you here. It only makes sense that I get a share of the wild bones you dig up— such is a rule I've made."</p>

  <p>"A rule, you say?" Zheng looked at Sarah and Hiram who were standing far in the distance. "Do you mean that you also have a share in their wild bones?"</p>

  <p>That made Amos sneer. "You're different from them. Cut the crap! Now that I know you have a wild bone, you must give me a good share!"</p>

  <p>Sarah and Hiram were about as strong as Amos, allowing them to refuse to share anything with him.</p>

  <p>"Really? How many do you want?" Zheng raised his eyebrows mockingly.</p>

  <p>"I'll have ninety percent and you'll have ten percent of everything. You're far too weak to be using so many wild bones, anyway— they're wasted on you," Amos said, observing Zheng's expression. He figured that a scared loser like Zheng wouldn't dare to disobey him in spite of his courage.</p>

  <p>In fact, according to the Nine Li race's rule, they were prohibited from any internal killings— such an act would receive severe punishment.</p>

  <p>But the four were completely alone in the wilderness. Who else could've known if Sarah and Hiram kept silent?</p>

  <p>Too many people had already died there— they themselves were killed by the Yellow Emperor race and by their own companions. People murdered and were murdered every day— no one would investigate the truth seriously.</p>

  <p>"Not bad," Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're rather sensible." Thinking that Zheng had already agreed, Amos smiled wider.</p>

  <p>"I mean, your dream isn't half bad." Zheng shrugged, ready to leave without giving Amos another look.</p>

  <p>"You! You're courting death!" Amos shouted in his anger.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until this moment that he finally realized Zheng had no intention of sharing the wild bones with him whatsoever.</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice fell, he rushed right at Zheng without even activating the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>The moment he got close enough to Zheng's back, the latter turned around and with a shiny light flashing in his dark eyes, Amos stared right at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>An intense pain suddenly struck Amos' mind, as though he was hit by an enormous stone— he felt like he could faint right then and there.</p>

  <p>When he staggered back, a long sword appeared in Zheng's grasp.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>He gasped as the sword cut through his neck.</p>

  <p>The blade of the Shadow Bearing Sword was extremely thin and Zheng had a great understanding of the human body's distribution of bones, blood, and veins in the neck.</p>

  <p>Although the sword pierced Amos' neck in a terrifying image, it did not cause substantial damage.</p>

  <p>"Uh..."</p>

  <p>Amos didn't even dare to move or speak at this moment and merely stood there like a puppet, staring at Zheng wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>Never did he expect the man to be so fierce. Amos didn't dare to use the Wild God Power— if he grew bigger this instant, the sword would split his body into two.</p>

  <p>With the sword in his calm grasp, Zheng wore an indifferent yet gentle smile on his face as he asked, "So who is really courting death here?"</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sarah and Hiram rushed over to them.</p>

  <p>When they saw the scene, their eyes went wide with shock.</p>

  <p>No one was expecting Zheng to take control of Amos with a single sword strike. The two were momentarily stunned at the thought.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Sarah asked.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, calm down. It's our destiny to be in the same group and take care of each other. The Nine Li race has made a rule to forbid us from killing each other." Hiram tried to smooth things over between Amos and Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Rule?" Zheng glanced up at the pair indifferently. "Does he follow that rule? He just made up a rule that I must give him ninety percent of all the wild bones I find. Do you think that's reasonable?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Sarah and Hiram looked at Amos in astonishment.</p>

  <p>A ten-ninety deal?</p>

  <p>That was too greedy, even for him.</p>

  <p>Thinking that Zheng was an easy target, he never thought the guy's counterattack would be so fierce— Zheng had defeated him in a single sword strike.</p>

  <p>"Well... Zheng, I was greedy, but you are broad-minded. Please forgive me.</p>

  <p>I know that there are many wild bones in several other places.</p>

  <p>Friendliness itself is a source of wealth. We must dig out more of them together."</p>

  <p>Because his life was clearly in Zheng's hands, Amos tried to curry favor with the man.</p>

  <p>People like Amos and Hiram came from the bottom of society— they obtained what they wanted by fighting fiercely and held no principles. In the face of those who were stronger than them, they easily gave in and shifted attitudes.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly as he stared at Amos. "No matter whether or not you mean what you say, if you dare to pick another fight with me, you will definitely die— I will not hesitate. If you don't believe me, you can always try provoking me, but this is your final chance. You'd better not act on impulse once I release you from this sword."</p>

  <p>As soon as his words faded away, Sarah's, Hiram's, and Amos' expressions shifted.</p>

  <p>Sarah and Hiram thought that Zheng was only able to get Amos under his control because his attack came as a surprise. Even Amos thought the same.</p>

  <p>If Zheng let go of him, Amos would activate the Wild God Power and turn into a giant up to 8, 000 feet. Then, killing Zheng would be as easy as squashing an ant.</p>

  <p>Never did he expect Zheng to be such an arrogant man, void of any fear of him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's right hand suddenly shrank and the Shadow Bearing Sword was pulled from Amos' neck.</p>

  <p>It was sharp, but it did not draw a single drop of blood.</p>

  <p>The other touched the paper-thin scar on his neck and heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>He gave Zheng another look. Thinking of the man's warning, Amos couldn't help but shudder.</p>

  <p>Zheng was probably not as simple as he first seemed.</p>

  <p>So then Amos decided to put up with the act to see what would happen.</p>

  <p>If he found that Zheng was bluffing, then he'd make his move.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, cared nothing about what was on Amos' mind— he wanted to dig for more wild bones instead of wasting time on Amos and the others.</p>

  <p>Plenty of wild bones lay in the area, but Zheng used his spiritual sense to search for them, pulling them to him with strength source. It was an extremely efficient method— wherever he walked, he took all the wild bones in the area for himself.</p>

  <p>After observing him, Sarah and Hiram got a sense of what Zheng was doing, making them even more curious about his origins.</p>

  <p>In just about six hours, not many wild bones were left in the area— Zheng had obtained almost every single one. Sarah then suggested they move to another spot.</p>
