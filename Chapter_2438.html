<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2438 Sunrest Wood Spring </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the top-rank True Gods began to slow down as they fell.</p>

  <p>Enoch and the other top-rank True Gods breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>They had really been out of luck this time and hadn't expected to face such a crisis when they had just entered the cave at the center of Sunrest Wood.</p>

  <p>"I really narrowly escaped death!"</p>

  <p>"I was so close to death. One of the Fanged Cicadas scratched my forehead."</p>

  <p>"How many people have died?"</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods all looked relieved.</p>

  <p>"There were forty-seven explosions in all. Including the one whose head was tore off by Duke, a total of forty-eight people have died," a top-rank True God said calmly.</p>

  <p>Not all top-rank True Gods were panicking.</p>

  <p>Some of them had gone through some unimaginable trials and tribulations.</p>

  <p>They were indifferent to questions of life and death, and had even taken the time to memorize these matters, despite how dangerous the situation was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the top-rank True God, surprised that he had counted the number of the people who had died.</p>

  <p>Forty-eight people had indeed died, including forty-three disciples of the first-tier clans and five belonging to the rich clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>This top-rank True God was very thin, inconspicuous in his appearance and eyes brimming with a radiant vigor. Luo Zheng didn't know which clan he belonged to and hadn't noticed him before.</p>

  <p>Reinhard turned his sword and in a matter of mere moments, turned into a ray of white light. He then came up to Yan and bowed to her. "Thank you. If it weren't for you, more people would have died."</p>

  <p>Reinhard was certain that Yan was the most important person in the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>According to Reinhard's estimation, if Yan didn't make a move, at least half the members of the Sword Clan would die when faced with so many Fanged Cicadas attacking. Even Reinhard might die!</p>

  <p>All of them relied on Yan's protection when they passed through the section of the road that had the largest number of Fanged Cicadas.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome," Yan replied rather indifferently.</p>

  <p>Reinhard didn't care about Yan's attitude. Marsh had chosen them and the twelve top-rank True Gods of the Sword Clan had made up their minds to be death warriors.</p>

  <p>He turned around and said to the remaining ten disciples of the Sword Clan through his life vitality, "The next task is to protect Yan. You can give up on protecting the others, but if anyone wants to hurt Yan, you must try your best to rescue her!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Sword Clan understood that, and were thinking on similar lines as Reinhard.</p>

  <p>"What about Luo Zheng?" a disciple of the Sword Clan asked through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Reinhard glanced at Luo Zheng, who was standing behind Yan, and then said with a smile, "This guy has a good reputation in the Time Sea and has even played tricks on a group of consummate True Gods. But he is just a low-rank True God. So don't take him too seriously."</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Reinhard underestimated Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had once taken away the jade seal from the hands of a group of consummate True Gods, which had, at one time, been truly inconceivable.</p>

  <p>However, everyone believed that Luo Zheng was successful just by lucky coincidence. It was definitely not a demonstration of strength, and any consummate True God could easily kill him.</p>

  <p>Even the top-rank True Gods weren't taking Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Duke and the top-rank True Gods from the alliance of the rich clans had different intentions.</p>

  <p>Duke's lips moved, and it was obvious that he was also giving orders. He would occasionally look at Yan, a trace of fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you are so amazing!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng praised once everyone began to descend.</p>

  <p>Yan's stoic expression was suddenly replaced by a brilliant, proud smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm far more talented than you think!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was very curious about her token that she could launch the attack merely through speaking. But he knew that this was not the right time to discuss it, so he didn't persist.</p>

  <p>After they passed through the rotten worm, the vertical hole in the tree was restored to peace.</p>

  <p>Everyone descended at a steady speed.</p>

  <p>All of them were extra-vigilant after the battle.</p>

  <p>"Drip, drip..."</p>

  <p>As they continued to fall, they suddenly heard the sound of dripping water.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that?" someone mumbled.</p>

  <p>They were now a little worried and scared, wary of anything that was odd and remotely terrifying.</p>

  <p>However, as Reinhard glanced down, his expression morphed into one of surprise.</p>

  <p>"It's the Sunrest Wood Spring! I hadn't expected the Sunrest Wood Spring to really appear here!"</p>

  <p>At this, the other top-rank True Gods were surprised, eyes bulging out of their sockets.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring was born in the middle of the Sunrest Tree. It was so rare, even in the Sword Clan, that it usually took one hundred years to obtain a potful of Sunrest Wood Spring.</p>

  <p>Once the Sunrest Wood Spring was released into the inner world, it could benefit all the living beings there. What was more, it was a favorite of all pill refiners and weapon refiners. It could be argued that the Sunrest Wood Spring was the magical water.</p>

  <p>This was why the Sunrest Wood Spring in the divine land was exorbitantly priced.</p>

  <p>Someone from the Sword Clan had also speculated that there might be a large amount of the Sunrest Wood Spring within the trunk of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>But during the debates over the Divine Dao in the past, there was no True God who had discovered the Sunrest Wood Spring.</p>

  <p>The dripping sound of water continued to reach their ears.</p>

  <p>As the crowd descended, they saw many small protruding platforms around the cave wall, on which a number of hollows were nestled. These hollows were filled with dark green sap.</p>

  <p>Every time a drop of Sunrest Wood Spring fell, the sap rippled lightly.</p>

  <p>"That's a lot!"</p>

  <p>"Why has so much Sunrest Wood Spring appeared so suddenly?"</p>

  <p>Some True Gods became excited and rushed forward.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan frowned.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring was extremely precious to the Sword Clan and there was so much of it here! They were of the opinion that all of it should belong to the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>At the debate venue, however, if someone from the Sword Clan were to try to stop those excited True Gods, it would lead to an immediate dispute.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Luo Zheng moved so that he was standing at the edge of a platform.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen the Sunrest Wood Spring before.</p>

  <p>In the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Drew had used a pot of Sunrest Wood Spring to forge his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unable to move at the time, but he could see that Holy Drew was obviously unwilling to use the Sunrest Wood Spring.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring was very valuable to Holy Drew. He knew that it must cost a fortune.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had broken through and become a low-rank True God, his cultivation base had stopped increasing.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods had begun to expand their inner worlds after forming the Godly Tiles.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the clouds were transformed from the life vitality sea in the inner world and gathered into the Godly Tiles throughout the day and night.</p>

  <p>As long as one kept making breakthroughs in the Divine Dao, it would be natural for them to create a Godly Tile of a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>But things always became complicated when it came to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy could not be gathered into the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>He wondered if he had to look for the brown mud as he continued to advance.</p>

  <p>Now, he even couldn't figure out the use of the divine might coin.</p>

  <p>He had heard that it could greatly benefit the creatures in the inner world if one drank the Sunrest Wood Spring directly. So he would try it too.</p>

  <p>But as he stood up, a harsh voice sounded around him. "Get away from here! This is my place!"</p>
