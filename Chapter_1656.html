<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1656 A Place With Many Talents </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The mysterious young girl looked at Luo Zheng through the layers of clouds and the purple light. Her eyebrows were knitted together, her expression of stunned disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is without destiny!"</p>

  <p>There were few warriors in the universe who didn't have a destiny, and they always went through a slew of terrible experiences.</p>

  <p>The common folk didn't know how the man without destiny had appeared, but the mysterious young girl was very clear about it.</p>

  <p>A living being was always born with its fate predetermined and none in the universe could escape its destiny.</p>

  <p>To become a warrior without destiny, one had to be someone who didn't come from the heavens or someone with a firm belief. They had to have experienced many cycles of life and death to erase their own destiny.</p>

  <p>But what was Zheng's purpose of becoming such a warrior?</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl was lost in deep thought, thinking about Zheng's request to find Yan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was confused at the mysterious girl's words.</p>

  <p>Evolutionary Fifty?</p>

  <p>Did it have anything to do with the fifty supreme worlds in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Separate one into two? One is variable, and another one is definite?</p>

  <p>Why did people have to be divided into two sections? What was the purpose?</p>

  <p>At the moment, there were two hundred warriors with definite destiny and ninety-nine warriors with variable destiny.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning and Tianming were warriors with variable destiny, while Nathan was one with a definite destiny. It was obvious that the division was not based on a warrior's strength.</p>

  <p>"Since I'm one without destiny, does that mean I can't be considered to be a warrior with variable fate?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found this entire matter of destiny to be too mysterious. He couldn't immediately figure this out, so he simply stopped thinking about it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there was some invisible force in the universe that secretly set everything right for him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng would only act according what his mind and beliefs told him.</p>

  <p>He could live compliantly if his destiny conformed to his wishes and plans.</p>

  <p>But if his life came into conflict with his expectations, then he would, without a doubt, revolt against it.</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, the pyramids that the names had formed at the top of the Illusion Spaces began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>The light from the stars in the sky had also been withdrawn from atop of the various supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>All Soul Sea Realm warriors, apart from those three hundred warriors, returned from the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie stared at the collapsing pyramid, her eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>"Is the competition in the Illusion Battlefield over?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Preston smiled and shook his head. "The most important part of the Illusion Battlefield is to strive for being a top warrior. This is only the beginning. But you'll see more than just names soon."</p>

  <p>"I can also see Luo Zheng, right?" Ning Yudie asked, her eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>Preston nodded. "According to the usual practice, yes. But I don't know if Luo Zheng has been eliminated or not. The second stage of the competition in the Illusion Battlefield is very intense, and there are a lot of ace talents fighting to stay in the competition. It is already very good that Luo Zheng has ranked in the top two thousand and five hundred. But I'm not sure if he can become one of the top three hundred warriors and remain in the Illusion Battlefield."</p>

  <p>The two thousand and five hundred warriors would undergo multiple rounds of elimination during the second stage.</p>

  <p>But from the moment they had entered the blood-red castles, the names of the top two thousand and five hundred warriors had already been fixed in the list.</p>

  <p>No one knew if they were eliminated or not.</p>

  <p>And now was the time to publish the results.</p>

  <p>Just as Preston was talking to Ning Yudie, the Illusion Space within the large hall began to shine, bursting out into magnificent colors.</p>

  <p>These colors looked like the most illusory energies as they began to flow and mix with each other, creating a magnificent picture of the wonderland at the top of the hall.</p>

  <p>The picture contained glimpses of celestial mountains, clouds and mist, buildings, and a lot of other beautiful imagery.</p>

  <p>Many figures could be spotted standing on top of the clouds.</p>

  <p>This image of evolution gradually appeared on every Illusion Space in the universe.</p>

  <p>In fact, both the Illusion Space and the Roaring Token relied on the Law of Causality in terms of operation. The Roaring Token used the Law of Causality to push sound through the universe, while the Illusion Space used the Law of Causality to create a projection.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Space was not a product of the universe, but a benefit that the mysterious girl had bestowed on the entire universe. Thanks to her permission, many sacred places could now easily create Illusion Spaces.</p>

  <p>At this moment, warriors of the entire universe could see the picture through reverse projection in each Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>As the figures became clearer, Ning Yudie turned more serious by the second.</p>

  <p>Every warrior who was paying attention to the Illusion Battlefield also realized the gravity of the situation and sobered down.</p>

  <p>"I see him."</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes were now fixed on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her excitement rose to the top, now that she had spotted him.</p>

  <p>She had maintained her reverence for the Upper World ever since she had ascended to it.</p>

  <p>Soul Sea Realm warriors were rare and powerful in the great world she was in, but there were a number of warriors at this cultivation level in the universe. There were so many talents that even a tenth-grade sacred place wouldn't be able to control a supreme world. And there were one hundred thousand supreme worlds in the universe.</p>

  <p>There were greater opportunities and challenges here.</p>

  <p>She had originally thought that it wouldn't be easy for him to enter a tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Yet, she hadn't expected him to become a top warrior in just a few years!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, the man she was looking at right now, was her pride.</p>

  <p>She felt joy at this, but as another thought crossed her mind, her brows knitted and she became visibly upset.</p>

  <p>A woman was snuggling up to Luo Zheng, her face full of happiness and joy.</p>

  <p>She was Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Is Luo Zheng one of them? Can you see him?" Preston, who didn't know who Luo Zheng was, asked Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Yudie's lip trembled but she collected herself before saying, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"He has indeed lived up to everybody's expectations! Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Preston said, smiling warmly. But when he saw Yudie's expression, he couldn't help but think, 'Ning Yudie should be happy to see Luo Zheng. Why does she look so morose?' So he asked again, "Which one is Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"The thirteenth warrior from the right," Ning Yudie replied flatly, without looking up.</p>

  <p>Preston looked, but he was surprised as his eyes landed on Luo Zheng. Preston was also an intelligent warrior and quickly gauged that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth warrior from the right was a handsome young man, but beside this young man was a beautiful woman who was leaning close to him. No wonder Ning Yudie was pulling a long face.</p>

  <p>Everyone was curious about a lot of things, and Preston was no exception.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was greatly interested in Luo Zheng. He thought Luo Zheng was a charming man who attracted beautiful, remarkable women. He knew that the woman with Luo Zheng also probably had extraordinary strength and Luo Zheng might also have started a romantic relationship with her in the short time he was in the Illusion Battlefield. These mere thoughts caused Preston to marvel at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The truth was that apart from Preston, every warrior of the universe could see Mu Ning snuggling up to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And they really looked like a happy, young couple.</p>

  <p>Those who knew Luo Zheng admired him. They also knew that the woman was bound to be at least an ace talent from a great force. Luo Zheng was amazing to have fallen in love with her during the short period of time they had been in the Illusion Battlefield. Their relationship had really developed fast.</p>

  <p>Those who did not know him were also impressed with him. They were also secretly speculating on Zheng's and Margaret's identities. Could it be that these two were a rare couple who had cultivated together and had simultaneously been ranked in the top three hundred?</p>

  <p>"Look! That must be Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning indeed has an eye for having chosen such a remarkable man!</p>

  <p>That guy is pretty handsome!"</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning is regarded as the ace talent in our Purple Power World, so of course, the one she takes a fancy to must be the best!"</p>

  <p>Since the Purple Power World had a special interface, it was impossible to construct an Illusion Space there.</p>

  <p>This meant that many warriors of the Apeiron Tower had to leave the Purple Power World and go to another supreme world to watch Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Preston couldn't help but ask out of curiosity, "Do you know the woman beside Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning Xi," Ning Yudie replied icily.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had known that Mu Ning was among the top warriors, but seeing this with her own eyes filled her with disappointment and sadness.</p>

  <p>"Oh? You know this woman? Where is she from?" Preston asked one question after another, his curiosity growing by the minute.</p>

  <p>"She's from the same great world as I am," Ning Yudie answered resignedly.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>Preston exclaimed, stunned.</p>

  <p>Of the three hundred warriors chosen in the Illusion Battlefield, two of them were from the same great world!</p>

  <p>This coincidence brought Preston to the point where he couldn't make sense of the situation.</p>

  <p>In the three thousand supreme worlds of the Humanity Alliance, only four warriors had had the chance to enter this stage of the Illusion Battlefield. Luo Zheng was one of them.</p>

  <p>How was it possible for two warriors from the Lower World to get this chance? This was inconceivable!</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that Luo Zheng and Mu Ning come from the great world that you ascended from?" Preston asked, wanting confirmation.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was not in a good mood. She pointed to one of them and said perfunctorily, "Why is it that amazing? The sixteenth warrior on the right is Hua Tianming, and he also comes from the same great world as me. He is one of the disciples of my Cloud Hall."</p>
