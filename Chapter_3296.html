<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3296 Treat The Boy </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng gave the strange black-and-white tree an astonished look.</p>

  <p>This plant in front of him was incredibly strange and new, something he had never seen before.</p>

  <p>The giant ape's words were vague but he heard them clearly. He was now certain that his speculations were completely right.</p>

  <p>There was indeed something here in the Dark Region that could make those creatures immune to candlelight, something not that rare that even the red python and human-monkey monsters could get.</p>

  <p>The two kinds of fruits of this tree right in front of him!</p>

  <p>Zheng pointed at a white fruit. "What about that one?"</p>

  <p>The giant ape also pointed at the fruit. "Eat... Not afraid of darkness..."</p>

  <p>This white fruit was useless to the creatures of the Dark Region since they were born in the darkness, but it was a different story for those that came from outside the region.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and Zheng looked at each other, exchanging a hopeful realization between them.</p>

  <p>If they ate this white fruit, would it perhaps be possible for them to walk freely in the darkness?</p>

  <p>The giant ape continued to point to the fruit. "You... Eat it."</p>

  <p>It had been inspired by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not a living creature in the Dark Region so the internal momentum of his Life Godly Way had the ability to hurt the three-eyed boy. However, what if Zheng merged with the Dark Region?</p>

  <p>It was with this curious thought that the ape found the tree, uprooted it, and carried it all the way back to the young man.</p>

  <p>"Whatever..."</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged. He had already eaten a lot of strange foods so he had no problem taking a bite out of this white fruit.</p>

  <p>He grabbed one off the tree and casually put the entire thing in his mouth.</p>

  <p>As soon as he swallowed, Zheng felt a soft energy spread from his stomach to his entire body.</p>

  <p>It was powerful and it didn't stop, even going as far as seeping into his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>As he let this strange energy flow through him, Zheng began to notice a few changes.</p>

  <p>The Dark Region had previously been dark. The only light in this place came from the candles and the giant ape's eyes. However, upon eating the fruit, Zheng found himself slowly being able to make out the shapes of things around him.</p>

  <p>He saw the blurry shadows of the mountains, various trees, and paths - Zheng could now see the Dark Region!</p>

  <p>"How is it?" Feng Ge asked.</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>Zheng walked to the edge, gently stretching his hand forward.</p>

  <p>He was a bit nervous, especially when his fingers reached the border. He hesitated for a few moments, debating whether or not he should insert his hand into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Knowing that he would never really know the result unless he tried, Zheng willed himself to cross the border and into the Dark Region. As soon as he did, he felt the gentle energy thrum underneath his fingertips and resisting the darkness.</p>

  <p>"It works!" Zheng exclaimed happily.</p>

  <p>The white fruit had changed his body, allowing him to walk in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>He knew it was far too early to celebrate though. They still needed to deal with the matter regarding the three-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>Since he now had the ability, Zheng figured that he should use the Life Godly Way in order to save the boy.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A ray of green light spiraled out of Zheng's body, casting an energetic aura around him.</p>

  <p>"Rain of life..."</p>

  <p>The green light coalesced above the three-eyed boy and formed a sort of fluffy green cloud. The internal momentum then turned into raindrops that fell on the boy's body.</p>

  <p>Zheng's internal momentum of the Godly Way no longer came into conflict with the three-eyed boy. Instead, it began to heal his wounds.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zheng found out that the power of the Godly Way remained too weak.</p>

  <p>It could work for those at the Other Shore Realm and hadn't yet reached the Chaotic Source Realm since their bodies were roughly on the same level as the True Gods, though the power they could use was hundreds of times stronger than the one used by the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Reaching the Chaotic Source Realm meant great improvements to a warrior's body.</p>

  <p>This three-eyed boy was a creature of the Dark Region and never experienced the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Zheng, however, couldn't resist the strength he released, which meant his body was at least comparable to that of those at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Using the internal momentum of the Life Godly Way to heal a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm was like using ordinary medical herbs on a warrior's critical injuries. It could work, but it would take an extremely long time.</p>

  <p>Two hours had passed...</p>

  <p>Four hours had passed...</p>

  <p>Six hours had passed...</p>

  <p>Luckily for Zheng, his inner world was extremely mature and he felt no signs of exhaustion despite constantly extracting internal momentum for a prolonged period of time.</p>

  <p>After seven hours, some small wounds on the three-eyed boy's body began to heal.</p>

  <p>After eight hours, black smoke began to rise from the surface of the boy's body as his body and the candlelight began to reject one another.</p>

  <p>"The protection time of the black fruit has expired," Zheng said.</p>

  <p id="top_29">Nonetheless, he did not panic. He reached out and took another black fruit from the tree and force-fed it to the boy.</p>

  <p>The black smoke instantly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Ten hours passed...</p>

  <p>Twelve hours passed...</p>

  <p>Green raindrops continued to fall down onto the three-eyed boy's body but some black spots appeared.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>The giant ape groaned, reminding Zheng to eat another one of the white fruits.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already begun to feel the fruit's effects starting to fade but he wanted to know just how long it could last.</p>

  <p>It seemed that it could last for fourteen hours at most.</p>

  <p>After picking another white fruit from the tree and consuming it, Zheng continued to unleash his Life Godly Way. His green life rain now practically soaked the three-eyed boy at this point.</p>

  <p>One day passed...</p>

  <p>Two days passed...</p>

  <p>Three days passed...</p>

  <p>Slowly, but surely, the boy's body recovered. Most of his torn flesh had been repaired at this point, though he remained in a comatose state.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the giant ape guarded the hut like a strong guardian.</p>

  <p>In the Grand Sky Temple, many people stood and stared idly in the distance.</p>

  <p>They could see the three huts, the Blue Twin Stars, but none of them could tell what had possibly occurred.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's Soul of Light manifested on a hillside, looking at the distance as she murmured a prayer.</p>

  <p>"I know that you are lucky and will be blessed to overcome any misfortune, so..."</p>

  <p>Before she finished her words, her Soul of Light dissipated and she retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Her consciousness had returned to the second floor of Zheng's house in the Flow Sword Sect, located in the Oneness Mountain of the Oneness Sky Palace, in the Bloom Divine Province of the Source World.</p>

  <p>She sat straight up in front of Zheng and gazed at his handsome face.</p>

  <p>He looked troubled and Dorothy couldn't help but wonder if he met with some kind of trouble.</p>

  <p>She stretched her hand and rubbed the wrinkles between his brows. "So...</p>

  <p>You will wake up!"</p>

  <p>Outside the door, Yudie sat all gloomy and worried. She had been sitting there for days, silent and brooding.</p>

  <p>Margaret wasn't as quiet, knocking on the door constantly and shouting at Dorothy to get out.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's guards could only glare at Margaret's insolence. Insulting the princess was a grave offense and if it wasn't for Dorothy's orders, they would've taken away this madwoman long ago.</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie were busy serving. They had no idea what was happening but they knew Zheng was in danger. To say they were worried about Zheng was an understatement.</p>
