<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Z..Z..Luo Luo Zheng.. It's Luo Luo Zheng!" said one of Simon's men as he trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>But Simon didn't need to be reminded. He had already seen Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>In truth, Luo Luo Zheng was the only person that the remaining confederates of the Heavenly Evil Sect were afraid of. The scene of Luo Luo Zheng killing Eddie was etched in their minds. It haunted them like a nightmare, one that they might not forget for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>Simon was extremely nervous, but his mind was racing. He first sized up Luo Luo Zheng and discovered that he had broken through to the Life and Death Realm!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was currently at the first level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he still had a chance to escape. Since Luo Luo Zheng had returned to the Central Region, Simon thought that he could choose to leave the Central Region and escape overseas and never set foot in the Central Region again.</p>

  <p>However, when Simon glanced at the people around Luo Luo Zheng, his face darkened, revealing an expression of utter despair.</p>

  <p>He could not read the strength of these people. This could only mean one thing? the gap between him and them was far more than a realm. A bitter taste filled Simon's mouth, which was even more bitter than the most toxic poison he had made.</p>

  <p>"Is he the guy you want to kill? Do you need some help? If you want to kill him, one swipe will finish him." Woody raised his black saber and glanced at Simon casually.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Delroy and the others just closed their eyes and concentrated on their cultivation. They didn't bother dealing with a Life and Death Realm warrior from the Lower World. A warrior at such a level was nothing more than an ant to them. Why would they bother about an ant?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng obviously knew that Woody didn't really want to help him. They just didn't want to waste time here. So Luo Luo Zheng just shook his head and said, "I'll handle this person myself," he said.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Simon took out two black beads. Although he was in despair, he still had a desire to live. Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng was about to attack him, Simon's life vitality suddenly surged.</p>

  <p>He crushed the two black beads in his hands and they emitted black poisonous mists, and his surging life vitality instantly made these mists spread!</p>

  <p>"Oh Lord! Ah?"</p>

  <p>"How can you?"</p>

  <p>"I? I?"</p>

  <p>Simon's subordinates did not expect him to activate the black beads without any warning. The poison contained in them was very powerful.</p>

  <p>The faces of the few Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors nearby immediately turned black and they instantly dropped dead.</p>

  <p>Whoosh?</p>

  <p>Using the cover of the poisonous mists, Simon turned into a beam of light and flew backwards.</p>

  <p>"No one has come after me! There is still a ray of hope!" Anticipation filled Simon's heart. He noticed that Luo Luo Zheng was standing firmly on the Eight-diagram Wheel without moving an inch.</p>

  <p>Dorothea was also sitting on the Eight-diagram Wheel but she suddenly turned around and reminded, "He's going to run away!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and replied confidently, "He can't escape!"</p>

  <p>He took out a dark golden longbow and a black arrow from his quiver.</p>

  <p>''Oh? A semi-divine-level bow and a divine-level arrow," Woody noted, but there was something odd about the way he said it. It was hard to tell whether he said this because he was envious or he was just ridiculing him.</p>

  <p>Delroy opened his eyes slightly, glanced at Luo Luo Zheng and then closed his eyes again. Divine weapons were rare in the Upper World. However, Luo Zheng's bow was only a semi-divine weapon. The black arrow was as powerful as a divine weapon, but it could only be used once, so he did not take them seriously.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng's first time using this bow. In any case, as long as he was in this great world, it was impossible for Simon to escape from his grip.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had indeed treated him as a target.</p>

  <p>He notched the arrow on his longbow. He seemed to have formed a connection with it. It was as if the black arrow could understand his intentions, and Luo Luo Zheng, in turn, could control the black arrow as he wanted.</p>

  <p>'This divine weapon can be connected to the person who uses it?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered curiously.</p>

  <p>To date, the best weapon he possessed was this dark golden bow, but it was only a semi-divine weapon. He wanted to have a divine-level sword, but he was afraid that it would be difficult to obtain one currently.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he would only find one in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"Draw the bow!"</p>

  <p>"Buzzzzz?"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng drew the bow, it emitted a faint ringing sound. He had used the power of nearly two hundred dragon scales just to draw the bow.</p>

  <p>His vision was blocked by a black poisonous mist, so he could not see Simon's figure clearly with his eyes. Luo Luo Zheng did not know how far he had fled as he was very fast, but a thought flashed in his mind and he immediately closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>He searched for Simon's location in his mind, using the will of the great world.</p>

  <p>"I found him..." he muttered and then he loosened his fingers, releasing the arrow.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh? "</p>

  <p>The black arrow shot out, piercing through the thick poisonous mists.</p>

  <p>It wasn't very fast in the start. It went at the same speed as a normal Soul Sea Realm master would when he flew at full speed.</p>

  <p>However, when the black arrow was released, Luo Luo Zheng could still feel that his soul was connected to it. He could feel that this black arrow seemed to contain three divine textures. If he wanted, he could activate the divine textures with his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng acted immediately.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was an explosion somewhere in the distance.</p>

  <p>With this explosion, the black arrow suddenly became twice as fast!</p>

  <p>"Explode again!" commanded Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The speed of the black arrow increased again. The more speed the arrow gained, the more powerful it would be!</p>

  <p>"Explode again!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Now the black arrow had reached its maximum speed. At this speed, not even a Soul Sea Realm master would be able to dodge it. Even Luo Luo Zheng had used Brianna's body when he had faced the arrow for the first time, he had only narrowly escaped it.</p>

  <p>But Simon was only a Life and Death Realm warrior...</p>

  <p>He was desperately trying to escape. As he flew, he released his perception and discovered that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't chasing him.</p>

  <p>But while he was using his perception to probe, he discovered that an arrow had appeared behind him!</p>

  <p>'He is shooting an arrow at me?'</p>

  <p>Simon immediately dismissed the thought. It was impossible. At his speed, ordinary arrows wouldn't be able to catch up to him at all.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the black arrow had already surpassed his thinking. The black arrow had already penetrated the back of his head and come out from his forehead, leaving behind only a small bloody hole.</p>

  <p>He froze mid-air. His remaining life vitality was still working, causing him to float in the air.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds when his life vitality dispersed, his body fell from the sky like a heavy sandbag, smashing into a hill with a loud crash.</p>

  <p>"Thump!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned the longbow lightly and put it back in his space ring. Then he smiled at Max and said, "Thank you, Max. I've already killed the person I wanted to."</p>

  <p>Some confederates of the Heavenly Evil Sect still remained, but the Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists meant nothing to him. It was not worth his time or energy to kill them.</p>

  <p>It had taken Luo Luo Zheng only a quarter of an hour, from the beginning when they had set out from Oracle City to the time they had arrived at the Southern Sky Mountain to kill Simon.</p>

  <p>Max nodded slightly. Since Luo Luo Zheng had settled all his matters, they could finally head back. Next, they would set off to find the Tower of Crystal.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Hank operated the Eight-diagram Wheel and returned to the Oracle City. At this time, everyone was gathered in front of the Heavenly Stellar Palace. When they saw that the Eight-diagram Wheel had returned, the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance and Ning Yudie were in a state of confusion. It had only been a while since they left.</p>

  <p>How did they return so quickly?</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Luo Luo Zheng told them that he had already killed Simon at the Southern Sky Mountain?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's efficiency stunned everyone. If one wanted to slaughter a chicken, one would have to sharpen the knife first. But, in such a short period of time, Luo Luo Zheng had already taken the life of Simon, who was thousands of miles away.</p>
