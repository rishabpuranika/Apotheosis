<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3218 The Edict Of Eastern Emperor Taiyi </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since Athemar's arrival, more and more people had been coming to Vastness Mountain to look for Zheng.</p>

  <p>All who came were strong, respected warriors of high ranks. Gethin stared at the newcomers, wondering who they were. Gethin scowled inwardly.</p>

  <p>Had he known that so many would be coming, he would have ordered the activation of the mountain-protecting array.</p>

  <p>As the two people came to a stop at the gate, he took a deep breath, fortifying himself.</p>

  <p>Like Gethin, everyone was watching the newcomers at the gate of the hall.</p>

  <p>One of them was none other than Master Hai, who was in charge of distributing the flags in Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Master Hai didn't intimidate Gethin, but unfortunately, he was not alone.</p>

  <p>Next to Master Hai stood a beautiful lady wearing a purple dress and a disarming smile. It was Flamine.</p>

  <p>By now, Gethin was totally confused. Who was Zheng? Why was he so significant? Wasn't he just a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect?</p>

  <p>Both the Origin Mountain and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had sent representatives for him, which Gethin found deeply unsettling.</p>

  <p>Why? What made Zheng so special?</p>

  <p>Flamine, still smiling, floated in the air, her ribbon fluttering in the wind.</p>

  <p>She looked like a lovely fairy from a classic painting.</p>

  <p>She flew towards them, saying lightly, "That young man is always involved in some kind of trouble, isn't he? What has he done to Vastness Mountain?</p>

  <p>Why did you take him?"</p>

  <p>As she entered, everyone present greeted her, including Athemar, Gethin, Goran and the leaders of the intelligence agency. Dorothy gave her a prim salute, and Yasamin gave her a curt nod.</p>

  <p>After all, Flamine was the favorite concubine of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. She was now the only person who could meet with him.</p>

  <p>Gethin sighed. Flamine's arrival and her status as Taiyi's favored concubine signaled the end of his resistance. He wondered whether Barnaby had already taken action. Had he obtained the Truth Enlightenment?</p>

  <p>Flamine flew to Yasamin and landed beside her, by the throne at one end of the Mighty Sword Hall. A golden token materialized in Flamine's hand. She held it up and spoke loudly, "This is an edict from Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Gethin, you are commanded to release Zheng immediately!"</p>

  <p>Gethin stared at her, the wheels turning in his head. The edict was unequivocal, but perhaps he could stall and buy Barnaby more time.</p>

  <p>After a moment, he pasted a smile onto his face. "Lady Flamine, I can't help but wonder why Zheng is so important? Who is he that Eastern Emperor Taiyi would issue an edict and send you in person to enforce it?"</p>

  <p>Flamine smiled back. "Zheng met my daughter earlier in the Phoenix Palace. I think the two of them are a good match! So as soon as I received the news from Master Hai, I decided to see how I could help Zheng. It's not so strange, is it, to want to assist someone who may very well be my son-in-law in the future?"</p>

  <p>Flamine's reasoning left Athemar, Goran, Winchell, and Master Hai dumbfounded. They raised their eyebrows at each other, lost for words.</p>

  <p>At Flamine's words, Dorothy's lips quivered, and she blinked quickly.</p>

  <p>Her grandmother Yasamin observed her expression and frowned.</p>

  <p>She could feel how unhappy Dorothy was.</p>

  <p>In her long rule over Origin Mountain, Yasamin had become more and more unsociable, but there was one person whom she still treated with kindness— her granddaughter, for whom she felt a great love.</p>

  <p>The people of Origin Mountain tended to walk on eggshells around Yasamin, for they were all afraid of her.</p>

  <p>Winchell, for instance, hadn't dared to inform her himself about Zheng's abduction. He had told Dorothy instead, and he had been as surprised as anyone when Yasamin deigned to go to Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>It showed just how much she cared about Dorothy. .</p>

  <p>In the days after Dorothy first met Zheng in the Sea of Truth, she had often brought him up in conversations with Yasamin. She told her grandmother all about Zheng and her experience with him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng had gone on to save Winchell's son, and then he had made it to the Other Shore. His successful exploits delighted Dorothy and she loved talking with her grandmother about him.</p>

  <p>But when Yasamin asked Dorothy directly whether she had a crush on Zheng, Dorothy would either blush and stammer and evade the topic, or get bothered and deny it outright.</p>

  <p>Still, Yasamin was wise and experienced, and she couldn't help but know how Dorothy felt about Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's stories had captured her attention and made her interested in getting to know Zheng, but Zheng hadn't gone to Origin Mountain. Instead, he'd joined in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Now, seeing her granddaughter's unhappiness at Flamine's declaration, Yasamin was upset. She shot Flamine a dark look and said, "It's not advisable to marry someone with nonhuman blood! We can't deny that the purity of one's blood is important. My Dora's blood is the purest!"</p>
