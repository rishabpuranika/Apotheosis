<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 95 A Rich Harvest Of Crystal Cores (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Confronted with six blade locust officers at once would have even a hardiest refiner at the nature level quaking in his boots.</p>

  <p>A blade locust officer was more powerful, in both speed and strength, than the average blade locust. However, it was the venomous thorns that were the most frightening.</p>

  <p>In the desert, there was a scorpion whose deadly sting killed any creature that was stung, instantly, and, in the forest, there was a ghost-like butterfly whose powder was so toxic that it would make the area desolate for miles around.</p>

  <p>However, refiners at the nature level weren't usually frightened of those creatures, given that their life vitality could prohibit toxins from entering their bodies. Simply put, it was more difficult for toxins to affect their bodies.</p>

  <p>Differing from those two deadly creatures, the venom that the blade locust officers possessed wasn't fatal. Instead, the toxin severely paralyzed the victim and could break through the life vitality barrier to penetrate the human body. Even those who reached the nature level were unable to move once infected.</p>

  <p>Thus, when it came to fighting the blade locust officers, everyone needed to be on guard. After all, once paralyzed, one was nothing but food for blade locusts.</p>

  <p>Others feared the blade locust officer's poison, but not Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Considering his body was a mysterious weapon, there wasn't any poison that could harm him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although it seemed foolhardy of him to rush at the blade locust officers alone, in actuality, he was quite prepared.</p>

  <p>As he leaped through the air, he slipped a ring on one finger, while the other was steadfast on the broken flying knife. They were the pair of copper rings with the invisible chain linking them that Master Su gave him.</p>

  <p>Six blade locust leaders spread out around Luo Zheng, closing in on him while shrieking. Suddenly, purple thorns shot from their bodies at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing an onslaught from stings that everyone else was desperate to avoid, Luo Zheng didn't duck and instead let them pierce his skin. At that moment, he threw the broken flying knife.</p>

  <p>"Slash!"</p>

  <p>As the flying knife flew through the air, Luo Zheng waved the hand he had the ring on controlling the invisible chain, and immediately, the broken flying knife circled him.</p>

  <p>The razor edge knife sliced deeply into each blade locust officer's head as it made its way around Luo Zheng. With that, Zheng's strength was sapped, and he slumped to the ground.</p>

  <p>In midair, the heads of the six blade locust officers remained intact for a few seconds before separating awkwardly from their bodies, falling from the sky and slamming into the ground hard.</p>

  <p>The six officers were dead in a flash.</p>

  <p>"Wow! That was awesome! Luo Zheng, that was fantastic!" shouted Tank and others in amazement.</p>

  <p>Martin's eyes were filled with astonishment as well. As a centurion who fought blade locusts all year round, Martin should be the one who knew them best. He was well aware of how difficult it was to deal with the blade locust officers, especially their venomous stings.</p>

  <p>His skin was stabbed once by a thorn that a blade officer shot. The result was that he was immediately paralyzed and laid in bed recovering for a week before his ability to move was restored!</p>

  <p>But, Luo Zheng was pierced by multiple stings just now!</p>

  <p>The spines had rained down on Luo Zheng in a downpour that even an elephant couldn't withstand, let alone a man.</p>

  <p>Remarkably, Luo Zheng was alive and kicking, without any ill effects.</p>

  <p>"Is he even human?" murmured Martin in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Roger stood his ground, clasping his sword. Although he figured that Luo Zheng had made the first move because he was sure of being able to kill those blade locust officers, Zheng's performance exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>"I took the assignment because it was boring at the Cloud Sect. I never expected meeting such an interesting guy on my trip," muttered Roger under his breath as his eyes lit up in surprise. 'Talents like his are encouraging. As long as he doesn't die young, he's bound to be a hegemon, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>'Although there's no need to draw him over to my side, perhaps, I can give him a hand if he's in trouble in the future, ' he decided as he drew his sword from its sheath and faced the next wave of blade locusts.</p>

  <p>At this point, an unusually large number of blade locusts swarmed them, and a new round of shooting began.</p>

  <p>Enveloped in purple light from head to toe, Luo Zheng became bolder and bolder.</p>

  <p>A crystal core from a blade locust officer would earn him one point, and he had just beheaded six in one fell swoop, which was equivalent to six points he had gained. Fighting like this would earn him points much quicker than he could by killing ordinary blade locusts.</p>

  <p>But, blade locust officers differed from the common ones.</p>

  <p>They were intelligent, which meant they weren't prone to daredevil tactics like the average blade locusts.</p>

  <p>When the remaining officers saw that Luo Zheng had killed six of their cohorts in a single strike, they scattered and avoided him, while commanding more common ones to attack him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept swinging his arm. Under the strong outward force, the broken flying knife whirled violently around him.</p>

  <p>"Whirl, whoosh..." dozens of blade locusts charged Luo Zheng, but Luo Zheng adjusted his position, and they were sliced in half by the flying knife. Their remains were littering the ground. To Luo Zheng, the blade locusts were as defenseless as ants, even though others freaked out at the mere mention of them.</p>

  <p>Soon blade locust carcasses were piled up like a hill, and among them were the heads of several purple blade locust officers.</p>
