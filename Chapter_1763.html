  <p>
</p>

  <p>The destruction of the heavens meant the destruction of all living things.</p>

  <p>The inner world of a martial artist usually collapsed soon after he or she died, and all living things within would disappear, turning into dust and ashes.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon's words rendered the Supreme Lords speechless.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias pulled a long face. "So that means that we have to get involved in it?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng shook his head. "We do not force anyone to join it. But you have been involved in this since the moment you were born."</p>

  <p>The Holy Being was dying, which meant that sooner or later, the universe would collapse.</p>

  <p>Then, the trillions of creatures in this universe would disintegrate with the collapse of the heavens.</p>

  <p>But what they released once they disintegrated was not life vitality. This was because the whole universe would collapse with the collapse of the heavens. Everything after that would return to chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>But compared to the Holy Beings of the divine land, the martial artists of the universe were first-level living creatures. So when the inner world of an ordinary martial artist in the universe collapsed, creatures in there would turn into life vitality.</p>

  <p>There was pin-drop silence in the moment.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Nathan, and the other juniors were not so flustered. They were not that old, and they did not have so many missions, scruples or worries.</p>

  <p>But all the Supreme Lords present were either responsible for the fate of their own races or clans.</p>

  <p>If the universe were to shatter, they would lose way more.</p>

  <p>After a long period of silence, Supreme Lord of Original Sin said, "Our Xuanyuan Clan will try our best to help the Celestial Position race."</p>

  <p>"The Ji Clan will also spare no effort!" The patriarch of the Ji Clan also spoke up.</p>

  <p>"The Lie Clan will go all out!"</p>

  <p>"Our Clan too..."</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded towards the four Supreme Lords of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>On the surface, it seemed that the connection between the Celestial Position race and the Thoughtless Minds wasn't too deep. But in reality, these two forces had had the closest relationship in the past.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being had more than one disciple.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race was created by Harold Yu, the chief disciple of the Holy Being. The four major clans of the Thoughtless Minds represented the other four disciples of the Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The inheritances of the four great clans came from these disciples.</p>

  <p>It was no accident that the Thoughtless Minds had been superior to many other great forces and had risen to such levels. Besides, three Godly Geniuses of the four great clans had even managed to break into the top ten warriors in the universe. This was no accident, and they had been encouraged by the Holy Being's disciples.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords were silent for a moment. Then, the Supreme Lord of Oracle said pleasantly, "I represent the Humanity Alliance. We will go all out in this crisis!"</p>

  <p>It was a war with no choice.</p>

  <p>It was because the result was too simple. It didn't matter if the opponent was strong or not. With resistance, there was still a chance for survival.</p>

  <p>Not resisting meant death!</p>

  <p>Once the four Supreme Lords of the Thoughtless Minds had made their stance clear, the atmosphere relaxed gradually.</p>

  <p>"Since we have no other choice, I will take a stand on behalf of the ancestors of the Saya race. We will fight with all our might."</p>

  <p>"Our Giant race..."</p>

  <p>There were one hundred and twenty eight Supreme Lords in the universe, but not all of them were present there.</p>

  <p>But all the Supreme Lords present represented 90% of the forces of the universe. Their opinions were the symbol of all-out war.</p>

  <p>Once all the Supreme Lords had expressed their stances, the Five-clawed Golden Dragon asked in a hoarse voice, "How much time is left?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng shook his head. "I'm not sure. At this stage, I can't predict when they will be able to break through the Sighing Wall, but there might not be much time left."</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon lowered his head and said, "I want to rebuild the dragon body."</p>

  <p>"Reconstructing the dragon body?" Master Feng said awkwardly.</p>

  <p>It was easy to find a body for Xun, but a Genuine Dragon was a thousand meters long and could hover in the air like a small city. To rebuild a Genuine Dragon's body was something that could only be done in the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>But the whole plan had begun a long time ago. The mystery of the nine dragons had originally involved this issue.</p>

  <p>"The body which is built using the heavenly essence isn't as good as the original body. But it's still enough," the Five-clawed Golden Dragon continued.</p>

  <p>"Build the heavenly body?" Master Feng repeated, confused.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I need a large amount of heavenly essence," the Five-clawed Golden Dragon said, nodding.</p>

  <p>The heavenly essence was extremely important for weapons in the universe. But if refined alone, it could only be used to improve the rank of a weapon. It wasn't that strong.</p>

  <p>Master Feng was puzzled as he said, "It's not that we can't bring more heavenly essence, but the heavenly body seems to be inferior to that of a puppet. We have a master who is the best and most proficient at making puppets in the Celestial Position race. If we have enough time, we can ask that master to make the puppet bodies for the nine Genuine Dragons."</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon laughed. "Harold didn't leave all the information to you. The purpose of the heavenly essence is only to coordinate with the primordial energy to forge sharp weapons."</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon's words confused many of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Separating the heavenly essence from a weapon was troublesome, but it wasn't something that couldn't be done.</p>

  <p>But to them, the heavenly essence was only the necessary material in the refining process. They started to realize that the heavenly essence seemed to be so much more than just this.</p>

  <p>"After the heavenly body is condensed, we nine brothers will gather together to help Luo Luo Zheng become more powerful. He must go even further."</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon had not spoken a single word to Luo Luo Zheng since his appearance. At his words, Luo Luo Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>But the Five-clawed Golden Dragon didn't explain the meaning of the heavenly essence and its other functions to anyone.</p>

  <p>Having said this, the Five-clawed Golden Dragon withdrew into Luo Zheng's mind. The other eight Genuine Dragons also disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked dejected. He sounded a question in his mind. "Hey, what do you mean by going further?"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was the kind one, with whom Luo Luo Zheng was on good terms.</p>

  <p>He was the first to wake up, followed by the red dragon. The red dragon had been silent for a long time, but it was not hard to communicate with him. The Five-clawed Golden Dragon was quite imposing, as if he had completely ignored Luo Luo Zheng from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of these words?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>The nine Genuine Dragons were firmly coiled on the Divine Flame Cauldron, but none of them responded to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Cyan dragon!" Luo Luo Zheng shouted in his mind furiously.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the Five-clawed Golden Dragon finally opened his eyes. "You're really in a hurry. It might not be good for you if you know some things so early."</p>

  <p>"You always keep me guessing! Why do all of you always hide something from me?" Luo Luo Zheng was furious.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon smiled faintly. "You should believe that this is for your own good."</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" Luo Luo Zheng was firm this time. "If not, I would've been the first to choose not to cooperate."</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon glanced at Luo Luo Zheng and on seeing that Luo Luo Zheng was serious about this, let out a sigh that echoed in Luo Zheng's mind. "You are the lucky child born in the Time Sea, and also the attempt of two Holy Beings. This is the unprecedented attempt to overturn the divine land.</p>

  <p>Success or failure does not depend on your will. It doesn't matter if you cooperate or not at this stage."</p>

  <p>"It's not important?" Luo Luo Zheng pondered over the Five-clawed Golden Dragon's words, wearing a smile that screamed irony and anger.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon's words were very clear. He was definitely a very important part of their plan.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng wasn't in a particularly important position at the moment, which meant that his decision wouldn't change the general situation.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had fallen into confusion once he had returned from the Illusion Battlefield. Everything he saw had undergone earth-shattering changes, including Xun and Tianming.</p>

  <p>After having thought and endured everything for so long, Luo Luo Zheng finally let loose his fury.</p>

  <p>"If I'm not important, does it mean that I can do whatever I want?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, his nostrils flaring.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon did not respond.</p>

  <p>"So I can choose to give up everything? Even my own life?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up. He was not someone who would give up on himself recklessly. But now, he had lost the right to know things about himself.</p>

  <p>What was more, his own values had been overturned.</p>

  <p>He was unwilling to cooperate with their plans in this situation.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Luo Zheng's words took an effect, so the Five-clawed Golden Dragon's voice floated over from the depths of his mind. "Have you stopped looking for your sister?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression clouded at the question.</p>

  <p>He wondered whether his own sister had been kidnapped by these guys.</p>
