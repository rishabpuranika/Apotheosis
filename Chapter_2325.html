<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Becoming a Holy Being's disciple in the divine land was an unparalleled honor.</p>

  <p>It was a rare thing. Even the biological children of a Holy Being didn't necessarily have a chance.</p>

  <p>And Nicholas was the kind to accept a disciple only once in a blue moon.</p>

  <p>This meant that Nicholas truly thought highly of Zheng, wanting to cherish his talent.</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, Samuel replied, "It's of great fortune for him to be accepted as a disciple. He will be overjoyed once he hears the news when he leaves the Time Sea Forbidden Land."</p>

  <p>Joy and the other Holy Beings only rolled their eyes at Samuel's words.</p>

  <p>As a proving godly warrior, Zheng could win over thirty times consecutively. What was more, he had already defeated Nelly who ranked first among the low-rank True Gods. It could be said that the anonymous man was already unbeatable among the low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Who wouldn't want to take him in as a disciple, so talented a person as he was?</p>

  <p>One could assume that if Zheng were there to choose, any Holy Being would take him in gladly.</p>

  <p>In order to please Nicholas, Samuel never cared about his self-esteem.</p>

  <p>Joy cast a sidelong glance at Samuel before sighing inwardly. Though she had always admired him, the arrogant man was no bowing to another Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was indeed powerful. The union of the wealthy clans he dominated had an absolute advantage in the Hall of Holy Beings. But there were not only the union of the wealthy clans and the Dongfang Clan on the Time Sea. The Moon Clan and the Sword Clan were not afraid of him.</p>

  <p>"But… I'm worried that Nathaniel will be too angry and he may kill the child by mistake," Nicholas said, looking to the distance. He was not pretending that he was worried, since he truly did want to take Zheng in as a disciple.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had an estimate of Zheng's strength— at this stage, Zheng could probably defeat an ordinary mid-rank True God. But Nathaniel was the top figure among the mid-rank True Gods— even if he was hurt by the Blood Breaking Bite of the Murdering Godly Way, if Nathaniel really took it seriously, it was possible that Zheng would be no match for him.</p>

  <p>"I'll send Soren a message and have him control the situation. I won't let them take the fight too far," Nicholas said quietly.</p>

  <p>To the Holy Beings, battles between the True Gods were like mere children's fights.</p>

  <p>In the valley, the Goddess Statue looked up to the sky while the atmosphere in the valley grew serious.</p>

  <p>"It's quite interesting." Nathaniel stared at Zheng for a moment and continued, "I didn't expect you to be the anonymous man who participated in the battles of challenging higher-level warriors. You've set quite the record for thirty-three consecutive wins. Good for you! That day, my sister invited you to join our clan, but you turned her down quite bluntly. She lost her temper and almost destroyed her own palace."</p>

  <p>Pearl's looks were deceiving. While she appeared weak and mild, she was actually highly competitive. Naturally, she was furious when Zheng refused her so forcefully. After leaving the Arena of Legends, she had indeed caused a great commotion in the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>"You have good talent, but it's a pity to see how blind you are,"</p>

  <p>Nathaniel remarked, shaking his head. "In that case, I'll help Pearl vent her anger— I will kill you today."</p>

  <p>As he announced this, layers of earthy yellow internal momentum began spreading out from his body.</p>

  <p>The rich internal momentum of the Earth Godly Way from his legs transformed him and the very earth into a whole— it was now impossible to separate them.</p>

  <p>At this time, he held a black axe suddenly in his hand.</p>

  <p>Not too far away was Zheng, narrowing his eyes at the scene. Since he knew the battle was inevitable, he had no intention of backing down.</p>

  <p>With his identity exposed, there was no need for him to hide anything.</p>

  <p>Faint purple mist gushed out from his body— it was the internal momentum of the Purple Aura Godly Way. He then extended his hands, making wisps of invisible force spread out, slowly condensing until they turned into four long swords.</p>

  <p>Appearing before him were the Buddha Emperor Sword, the Heavenly Tooth Sword, the Long Vine Sword, and the Grant Sun Sword.</p>

  <p>"The rumor is true!"</p>

  <p>"Four Gods Killing Swords…"</p>

  <p>"These four swords were summoned by Power Shaping… how on earth did he make it?!"</p>

  <p>The news that Zheng had formed four illusory swords with the Purple Aura Godly Way spread like wildfire.</p>

  <p>While most True Gods believed that Zheng knew how to use the Gods Killing Sword Array, very few believed that he could use four illusory swords.</p>

  <p>That was something only Joy could do, people believed.</p>

  <p>Or it could be said that only the Demi-holy Beings and the Holy Beings had the qualification to use it. To achieve this, one must have the Cross-world Theurgy to extract the nine stars' power from their inner world.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for a proving godly warrior to make it.</p>

  <p>The low-rank True Gods couldn't make it.</p>

  <p>Even a consummate True God couldn't make it.</p>

  <p>But when the scene unfolded, everyone was left stunned— they had no choice but to believe.</p>

  <p>"Soren, your brother may not be able to win, and after these Poisonous Wolf Scorpions are wiped out, the next wave of attacks will also come…</p>

  <p>Is this a suitable place for them to fight?" Reginald said helplessly.</p>

  <p>A playful look came over Soren's face. Hearing Reginald's words, he laughed out loud. "That's not a big deal at all. I'll take care of it." His body then flew towards the other side. There were several True Gods below him cleaning up all the remaining Poisonous Wolf Scorpions.</p>

  <p>"Stop! All of you!" Soren called out.</p>

  <p>Thinking that Soren would take the rest of the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions as his own, the True Gods stopped one by one.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they didn't want to compete with the top-rank True Gods, especially those of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>After expelling the True Gods, Soren made no move to kill the scattered Poisonous Wolf Scorpions. Instead, he blew gently at the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions, sending out an extremely cold breath, immediately freezing them.</p>

  <p>They weren't killed, only frozen.</p>

  <p>According to the Goddess Statue valley's rules, only after the last Poisonous Wolf Scorpion was killed would there be another round of fierce attacks.</p>

  <p>So long as these frozen Poisonous Wolf Scorpions were kept alive, the next wave of beasts wouldn't come.</p>

  <p>When Reginald saw the scene, his expression grew dissatisfied. Such a method was usually used to deal with the final attacks of the beasts in the valley. Because the attacks of the beasts would only grow fiercer and more powerful, the True Gods would grow just more exhausted.</p>

  <p>Everyone would try freezing one or two vicious beasts for some valuable rest time.</p>

  <p>But now, Soren used this method specifically for his brother's battle with Tianxing— it was too selfish of him.</p>

  <p>After Zheng summoned the four swords, he rushed to Nathaniel, as fast as the wind, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>After being hit by the Blood Breaking Bite, Nathaniel made no movement and instead stood still, carrying the black axe on his shoulder like a mountain. Seeing Zheng rush over, he called out, "Come on!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden wave of his hands, the black axe turned into circles of black shadows swirling crazily in his hands.</p>

  <p>While the axe was as heavy as a mountain, it was a feather in Nathaniel's hand.</p>

  <p>As the heavy axe spun at high speed, it seemed to tear the surrounding space apart.</p>

  <p>"Nathaniel is using the power of the earth."</p>

  <p>"The Earth Godly Way has an extremely horrible power. After it is integrated with the earth, it can use the earth in resisting the opponent's attack."</p>

  <p>"He is one of the elites."</p>

  <p>When all the others saw that Nathaniel was using his full strength, they were all left shocked— it was no wonder that with the cultivation base of a mid-rank True God, Nathaniel could defeat seven top-rank True Gods in a row.</p>

  <p>"Is he powerful?"</p>

  <p>As Zheng quickly approached, the sense of fighting in his eyes grew even stronger.</p>

  <p>"Buddha Emperor Sword, kill him!"</p>

  <p>Then, the sword rushed right at Nathaniel ruthlessly.</p>
