<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng originally had doubts regarding the blood exchange.</p>

  <p>But when he looked at the people around him, the expressions on their faces strengthened his resolve to go through with the blood exchange.</p>

  <p>"Master Feng, we agreed that we would perform the blood exchange today. Can we start as soon as possible?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a humble smile.</p>

  <p>Master Feng felt a headache earlier when he was interrogated by these people. His head further throbbed when he thought that he would probably still have to persuade Luo Luo Zheng into exchanging his blood. He was surprised that Luo Luo Zheng proved to be willing to perform the ceremony. It exceeded his expectations.</p>

  <p>"Brat, are you really sure you've thought this through? The Sky Origin Blood is an extraordinary thing. If your body can't handle it, you may bleed to death. It's very powerful," one of the Supreme Lords said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>A warrior nearby immediately chimed in, "Ordinary martial artists don't have the capacity to handle it at all; it might be better if you think about it again!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng strode into the center of the great hall and swept his gaze over these strong warriors.</p>

  <p>Under the scrutiny of these powerful warriors, any ordinary young warrior might be flustered and might even be unable to stand steadily on their own feet. But Luo Luo Zheng was unaffected; he had already encountered Supreme Lords and even faced them in battle.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled at them. "My Lords, do you think I'm an ordinary warrior?"</p>

  <p>As the words left Luo Zheng's lips, the expressions on the seven warriors' faces all froze. They realized that no warrior that championed the Illusion Battlefield could be ordinary.</p>

  <p>Master Feng snorted in disdain. He told the warriors, "At such a critical moment, why do you only care about the Sky Origin Blood?! You only see the step in front of you. You never think on a larger scale. You are too narrow-minded..." He then turned and addressed Luo Luo Zheng, "If you are already sure of your decision, follow me."</p>

  <p>With that, Master Feng walked away and entered the inner hall. Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head in affirmation and followed Master Feng into the inner hall. He had asked Freya to accompany him. The Supreme Lords and grand world lords exchanged a few glances between them before following their leader into the inner hall.</p>

  <p>The inner hall had a strangely unique structure. The center of the floor was deeply caved in, with a circular structure that spiraled upward like a staircase.</p>

  <p>"Stand in the middle of the room," Master Feng instructed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng acknowledged with a tilt of his head, before he descended into the spiral on the ground and stood in its center.</p>

  <p>The small number of Supreme Lords knew that they could not do anything to dissuade him, so they just stood on the side to spectate. On the other hand, Freya leaned onto a corner, staring downwards at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The Sky Origin Blood has tremendous power. It is up to your body if it can contain the blood's power," Master Feng warned, but there was no trace of worry in his tone. He understood Luo Zheng's capability extensively, even more than Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>After his statement, Master Feng clapped his hands; two martial artists immediately brought out a glass jar. This glass jar's height was almost equal to that of an average person, and it contained nothing but the golden blood up to its brim.</p>

  <p>If this was just a normal blood exchange, it wouldn't have required Master Feng's presence. But in this case, the Sky Origin Blood was too precious, and Luo Zheng's identity was also extraordinary, that Master Feng decided to help Luo Luo Zheng finish the process personally.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, cross your legs, close your eyes and focus," Master Feng instructed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed Master Feng's instructions and sat with legs crossed, as he entered a state of meditation. His mind eventually attained peace. To a martial arts practitioner, entering this state was as natural as eating and drinking.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had reached a peaceful state, he unexpectedly felt a sharp, stabbing pain in his chest: a small hole the size of a little finger appeared in it!</p>

  <p>His heart was pierced!</p>

  <p>The hole was made with utmost precision; its placement and angle were perfect. Just as sudden as he had felt it, a stream of blood immediately flowed out from the hole.</p>

  <p>Right then, Luo Luo Zheng panicked a little bit. Although he knew that usually a warrior's blood was strong, he would probably die if all his blood was drained.</p>

  <p>The crimson blood stream continued to flow along the spiral in front of him. A strange gravitational force seemed to be drawing his blood out!</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Master Feng opened the glass jar and the Sky Origin Blood surged out!</p>

  <p>While contained inside the glass jar, the Sky Origin Blood looked normal. But the moment that Master Feng lifted the lid off, it was as if a ferocious beast had been released. The Sky Origin Blood flowed towards the ground, thrashed about, and rushed from side to side, seemingly wanting to escape...</p>

  <p>This lump of blood had been contained there for a long time. It had already formed a blood spirit that had its own consciousness. It knew that it was going to be absorbed by someone, and it strongly resisted.</p>

  <p>Master Feng snorted derisively and reached out his hand to grab the air in front of him. The blood spirit was instantly annihilated, and the golden Sky Origin Blood was tamed to flow along a groove in the spiral.</p>

  <p>There were two grooves lying side-by-side into the spiral. Luo Zheng's blood flowed out along one groove, and the Sky Origin Blood flowed towards him along the other groove. Thus, the spiral formed two lines counter-flowing each other, one golden and one crimson.</p>

  <p>When the golden stream of the Sky Origin Blood spiraled down the groove and reached Luo Luo Zheng, Master Feng pointed his finger and another small hole appeared on Luo Zheng's chest. The golden Sky Origin Blood slithered like a small snake, seemingly enthusiastic, and leaped up to enter into the small hole!</p>

  <p>Two types of blood, one flowed inward, the other outward. This was how the blood was exchanged.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's eyes were tightly shut, he still felt what was happening within him. He sighed inwardly and wondered who invented this blood exchange method, as it was quite ingenious.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Luo Zheng did not have a chance to let his mind wander further.</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt the domineering power of the Sky Origin Blood!</p>

  <p>As the Sky Origin Blood entered Luo Zheng's body, he felt it flow into his arteries, starting from his aorta to his branch arteries. It spread through his blood vessels and covered every part of his body. It also started to circulate within his body immediately!</p>

  <p>As this was not Luo Zheng's own blood, his entire body felt as if it was swelling up. His flesh felt like it was about to explode, and as if some kind of monster wanted to break out from his body.</p>

  <p>It was only an illusion.</p>

  <p>What was actually swelling right now were the meridians in Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>They were located in almost every part of his body so he felt like his body was going to explode.</p>

  <p>It seemed to the onlookers that the veins on Luo Zheng's forehead, neck, and arms were bulging like there were countless little snakes wriggling under his skin. The sight terrified them.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords continued to stare at Luo Luo Zheng coldly. They also knew how important Luo Luo Zheng was. It was necessary for him to exchange blood to make it easier for him to hide, but the Earth Origin Blood would have been enough for this purpose. They thought that using the Sky Origin Blood was unnecessary!</p>

  <p>They just tried to intimidate Luo Luo Zheng earlier when they said that he would explode and die if he absorbed the Sky Origin Blood.</p>

  <p>These people had witnessed how unusual Luo Zheng's physique was during his performance in the Illusion Battlefield. They knew his body wouldn't easily explode and kill him.</p>

  <p>It puzzled them that Luo Luo Zheng was able to absorb the Sky Origin Blood quite smoothly.</p>

  <p>The last person who had absorbed the Sky origin Blood was Master Feng himself. During that time, he was already a world lord and he was exchanging the Earth Origin Blood for the Sky Origin Blood. But even then, the leader had suffered such tremendous pain.</p>

  <p>During the blood exchange ceremony, he wasn't able to stand the pressure and he had almost destroyed the entire hall.</p>

  <p>However, seeing Luo Zheng's reaction, they wondered why he had absorbed the Sky Origin Blood so easily.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords looked at each other, surprised expressions in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't you find it strange?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is as if this kid's original bloodline is the Sky Origin Blood. It's amazing that he didn't have any problem absorbing it?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, that's impossible."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't able to hear their discussion, as for that moment, he truly felt like he was about to explode.</p>

  <p>Every inch of his body exerted a tremendous amount of pressure, pressing outwards! His physical body was like a jar that was containing that enormous pressure within it.</p>

  <p>The enormous pressure tortured Luo Luo Zheng extremely. If only he could chop himself open into two to relieve the pressure!</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's physical body was uniquely one-of-a-kind.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his body's special ability came into play. As the immense pressure built up within his body, it turned into a warm current once again. It was the primordial energy...</p>

  <p>When refiners forged weapons, a portion of primordial energy would be produced by each strike of the hammer. The primordial energy constantly flowed around the weapon, so that the weapon was continually strengthened. Be it a fairy weapon, a sacred weapon, or a divine weapon, their abilities might be different but the same principles were still applicable. Even the supreme primordial weapons followed the same rules. The only exception was the supreme chaotic weapons.</p>
