  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't actually afraid of the platform smashing beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng did know though, was that his current strength was completely reliant on the strength of the Nine Divine Stars. In other words, it wasn't suitable for long-distance battles.</p>

  <p>If Quentin had relied on his nimble movements to attack him from a long distance, Luo Luo Zheng would most likely be taken advantage of and it would be difficult for him to fight back.</p>

  <p>Instead though, Quentin had chosen to use the Sky Pearl, which appeared to be some kind of treasure for strengthening himself. That was a good thing, to say the least. Quentin recklessly pounced toward Luo Luo Zheng, and Luo Luo Zheng thought that the item was exactly what he hoped it would be.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was unaware though that Quentin was simultaneously having these same thoughts.</p>

  <p>Quentin knew that this Sky Pearl could easily give himself a massive boost in a short period of time, whether it be in strength or speed. With this extra boost, he at the Spirit Transformation Realm, would have the strength to fight against a top-level world lord. There were no masters like a Supreme Lord in the divine land, and any world lords could find ways to condense their own Godly Tile. Speaking of such, there were actually plenty of ways to obtain a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>It was for that reason, and rightfully so, that Quentin was equally afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would slip away, or seek the protection of the Skyland race!</p>

  <p>That Sky Pearl only lasted for about two minutes, which was relatively short. Once Luo Luo Zheng succeeded in dodging the Mu Ning emitting from the pearl, his strength would begin plummeting and his chances for making a comeback would be completely over.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing that Luo Luo Zheng had no intentions in avoiding him or his attack, Quentin was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"Seeing as you're in such a hurry to die, don't blame me for this!"</p>

  <p>Quentin said. Other than this trace of happiness, Quentin felt unresigned deep inside his heart.</p>

  <p>What kind of secondary creature was he dealing with? In the past, these secondary creatures were existences whose lives could be taken by him at any moment. They were not worth mentioning. In fact, there were quite a few secondary creatures in the Qin Clan's teleporting area. In Quentin's opinion, these lower creatures could fight each other to death just to win a few trial tallies. However, they weren't qualified to battle him in any way.</p>

  <p>And now, this specific secondary creature standing before him was forcing Quentin to not only use his full strength, but use the great Wishing Spell as well. And he even took out the Sky Pearl in order to attempt beating him.</p>

  <p>Not much remained within Quentin now. Aside from his unwillingness and helplessness, Quentin was bursting with fierce intent to kill. The only way he would ever feel satisfied, the only way he would ever feel pleasure again was if he succeeded in killing Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment the two of them got close to each other, Quentin clenched his teeth and the green light emanating from his open hands immediately condensed into a pair of claw shadows, almost like a hologram. Those sharp claws were streaked with lines. These lines were actually divine textures, having evolved from true spirit and were the finest of all. These textures could be passed along to the next generation via blood lineage.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Quentin shouted angrily, staring at Luo Luo Zheng. Throughout his entire life, very rare were situations like these, where he had to fight with his life on the line. After all, there were plenty of crises that he had never had a chance to intervene in.</p>

  <p>To his opposite though, Luo Luo Zheng was grinning, portraying an indifferent smile.</p>

  <p>The power extracted from the Nine Divine Stars was now accumulating in front of Luo Luo Zheng. The powerful force continuously twisted the air and caused a visual distortion for anyone looking directly at Luo Luo Zheng. To them, it looked like it was Luo Zheng's body that was strangely misshapen in that way, twisting like a contortionist, or as if he was standing in front of a distortion mirror. No one could completely comprehend exactly what they were looking at!</p>

  <p>It definitely was nothing to be laughed at though. Everyone at present took this strange, distorted scene very seriously.</p>

  <p>Before this, Luo Luo Zheng, as a warrior in the Spirit Supreme Realm, surpassed everyone on the platform to the extent that no one could compete with him. Now, it was far beyond anyone's comprehension how he had thrown so many warriors from the divine land into the black water. Luo Zheng's powers once again began to rise suddenly and sharply. No one could predict what limit he'd reach this time.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng turned the invisible force into a shield and held it in front of him. He then rammed it into Quentin, who was pushed back with such force he flew into the air.</p>

  <p>Through his transparent power shield, one could see Luo Zheng's lips parted, revealing a bright, malicious smile.</p>

  <p>Quentin only had the time to catch a glimpse of his expression before the sharp green claws wrapped around his hands collided directly into the shield.</p>

  <p>Quentin's pair of green-light claws were condensed by the blood essence of the Heaven Duck. Such a creature's claws could literally slice through near anything. Even the Collapsing Mountain race's most sturdy Magic Golden Stone could be cut in half by a set of claws like these.</p>

  <p>In the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Quentin thought, there probably wasn't any material his terrifyingly sharp claws couldn't slice through.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Quentin, he couldn't have been more wrong. When Luo Luo Zheng used the shield formed by Nine Divine Stars, it wasn't a material object at all. It was only an invisible power.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the power could only be exerted to the extreme by means of media transmission.</p>

  <p>And, the most common medium still remained to be a fighter's own body and fists. A few of the body refiners equally used large hammers and battle-axes. These weapons could also be considered a form of medium.</p>

  <p>The power of Holy Being mastered by Luo Luo Zheng was much too strong for him.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current strength, no matter what medium he used, there was no way he would ever be capable of withstanding such great force.</p>

  <p>Choosing to use his body to bear it was not a good idea, his physical self would disintegrate. Even a supreme primordial weapon would break inch by inch.</p>
