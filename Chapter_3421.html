<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment they stepped into the arrays, as if triggering a sensor, the runes carved in the ground glowed with golden light. As a result, a protective oval-shaped light barrier enveloped everyone to safeguard them.</p>

  <p>The disciples from the various races had the right to walk in and out of the light barrier. However, everything in the Chaotic Source World that remained outside would be blocked from entering it. That included hurricanes and the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>When most people made their way safely inside the arrays, the hurricane in the Chaotic Source World rose once more with destructive intentions.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, some people had failed to seek refuge in the arrays in time to avoid the approaching calamity. As a result, they were carried away by the hurricane for tens of thousands of miles without pause.</p>

  <p>Still, in an infuriated state, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits broke her way through the hurricane and advanced forward.</p>

  <p>The plan of the giant eye was so ridiculous that it had cost the lives of almost all of her kind. It failed so horribly that she was the sole survivor among the members of her race.</p>

  <p>The only thing on her mind now was to exact revenge by killing as many people as she saw fit.</p>

  <p>But those people were like troublesome mice. As soon as the hurricane raged their way, they fled into the arrays to protect them against it.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits had little to no knowledge about the arrays.</p>

  <p>Over the years, they had made numerous attempts to destroy them, but they were all for naught as the arrays were carved in the void.</p>

  <p>Once the arrays were triggered to activate, the following light barrier that formed was able to withstand heavy amounts of force.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had also tried to tear down the light barrier, but it was unsuccessful every time.</p>

  <p>However, the scenario had changed later. Over the past ten years, the mother had fused with many other Chaotic Source Spirits, and her strength had far surpassed her previous limitations.</p>

  <p>With wide strides and the intentions to kill, she made her way towards the nearest array.</p>

  <p>"The mother of Chaotic Source Spirits is coming!"</p>

  <p>"She's headed our way!"</p>

  <p>"Don't panic! These arrays are the work of powerful masters in the Source World. They are practically indestructible!"</p>

  <p>The people stationed inside the array under threat were the members of the River Spirit race. They inhabited the area by the riverside. Similar to the Snake Goddess race, their body was a hybrid of a human and a snake.</p>

  <p>However, they had scales for feet and tentacles on their faces; their bodies overflowed with energy.</p>

  <p>The River Spirit race had high hopes attached to the array. They believed in it to be able to withstand heavy amounts of damage without a hitch.</p>

  <p>When the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits reached the array that was closest to her, she stationed herself directly behind it. With anger fuming from every breath she took, she raised her strong foot and stomped hard on the array with malicious intents.</p>

  <p>Watching this unfold, the members of the River Spirit race couldn't help but feel threatened by the massive strength fluctuating from it. They all gathered in one place, feeling frightened.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Even the rustling sound produced by the hurricane was insufficient to deafen out the loud noise of her foot trampling down on the array.</p>

  <p>The light barrier visibly trembled and recovered in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Nothing happened…"</p>

  <p>"What a relief! She can't break the array after all!"</p>

  <p>"I told you so!"</p>

  <p>The once tensed members of the River Spirit race rejoiced as they regained their lost vitality.</p>

  <p>Watching them ease up, the members of other races in other arrays relaxed their shoulders as if an overpowered burden was lifted off them. Their hearts that had leaped to their throats at the first sign of trouble sunk back down to their chests as they heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>If the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits were to be successful in her attempts to break the array, things would get complicated.</p>

  <p>"It's alright now…"</p>

  <p>"Let's use this opportunity to distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits among ourselves!"</p>

  <p>After they had taken the lives of many Chaotic Source Spirits, every race had obtained a lot of crystals.</p>

  <p>These crystals were sufficient for many people to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Now with the hurricane raging outside, they had nothing to do while they waited inside the arrays. This was the perfect time to distribute the crystals.</p>

  <p>Watching the others, the members of the Oneness Sky Palace turned towards Zheng, Feng Ge, and Dorothy with questioning eyes. All the Chaotic Source Spirits gathered by them were given to the three for safekeeping.</p>

  <p>"We should also distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits right now," Feng Ge said, withdrawing her gaze from afar.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Zheng said as he gave a slight nod. Just as he was about to take the Chaotic Source Spirits out of his space ring, he saw the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits raise her huge foot and stomp hard on the light barrier of the array again.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Another loud noise reverberated in everyone's ears, reaching distances far and wide.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming sound diverted everyone's attention towards it once more.</p>

  <p>Just like before, the light barrier shook involuntarily and later recovered.</p>

  <p>However, this time, the rate at which it trembled was much more violent. It soon became apparent that the barrier would not be able to hold for long against attacks with the same viscosity.</p>

  <p>When the sudden realization hit everyone, their inner emotions reflected on their faces as they lost their previous color and turned a pale white.</p>

  <p>They all understood that the arrays which had remained indestructible over the years were perishable under brute force.</p>

  <p>After the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits trampled on the array for a second time, she paused to recollect herself as she straightened up.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she jumped high into the sky, bearing the weight of her ten thousand feet high body, and came knocking down once more.</p>

  <p>The members of the River Spirit race in the array had already fallen victim to hopelessness. Before the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could touch the array, some of the members of the River Spirit race gave in to their fears and rushed out of the light barrier.</p>

  <p>The hurricane outside still raged with pressure. Soon as the members came out of the barrier, they were swept off their feet into midair and were thrown away.</p>

  <p>The members that remained inside the array felt hesitation in exiting the barrier. Although the River Spirit race was not a super force, it was respected around its territory. Therefore, high hopes were attached to it, and they were expected to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>However, they had managed to collect only a handful of Chaotic Source Spirits. Their last remaining resort was in the form of the mighty mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. After all, she must have absorbed tens of thousands of Chaotic Source Spirits to have progressed so far in strength.</p>

  <p>Them being blown away by the hurricane would indicate their surrender in the fight for obtaining more Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they could do nothing but pin their hopes on the array to live up to its potential and protect them.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits crash-landed on the array. The impact of the fall caused the extraordinary light barrier to collapse into insignificant pieces.</p>

  <p>As if keeping track of her targets, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits landed directly on the bodies of the members of the River Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Everything inside the array was soon squashed like a bug and reduced to nothing.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it… The array…is broken!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it. We're all doomed!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>Shocked after witnessing the tragic end of the River Spirit race members, the other people began to lose their sane minds and panicked.</p>

  <p>The arrays were their shelter. But now, after one was brutally crushed before their eyes, they could not depend on the remaining arrays to save them anymore.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha…"</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits broke out into malicious laughter.</p>

  <p>"You all are so naive! Do you honestly believe those arrays could protect you from me!? I will show you what despair feels like!"</p>

  <p>"Bang Bang Bang..."</p>

  <p>With large steps, she paced towards the next array.</p>

  <p>This array was occupied by members from small races.</p>

  <p>As they witnessed the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits approach them, their faces turned as white as a sheet as they held their breaths.</p>

  <p>They were smart enough to not repeat the same mistake the River Spirit race made. Before the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could destroy the barrier, they had planned to move out of it.</p>

  <p>Soon, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits ran for a few steps before she leaped in the air and landed directly on the array.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the people inside the array rushed out before they were crushed.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>This light barrier also perished under the strength of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, their quick thinking helped the members of the small races to avoid being stepped on by her.</p>

  <p>However, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was sharp-witted. She had foreseen their intentions to escape the array. Once they stepped out, they would be carried away by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Adjusting to the circumstances, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits slapped her hand in the direction of the hurricane. The pressure of the hurricane had made it hard for the warriors to resist and move freely. With pitiful eyes and helpless bodies, they watched the huge palm cover them up and slam them hard on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Bang Bang Bang..."</p>

  <p>With a series of dull thuds, more than a dozen bloodied bodies fell lifelessly on the ground. The desolate ground was painted a wild red with their blood spraying over from all directions.</p>

  <p>The traumatizing sight of these people made the survivors in the remaining arrays hyperventilate. They began to huddle up and discuss strategies to escape unscathed.</p>

  <p>However, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was not prepared to allow them the luxury of time. She turned around frantically and rushed towards the third array.</p>
