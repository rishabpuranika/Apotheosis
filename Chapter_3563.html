<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3563 Abandon The City </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Shocked at the words Luo Zheng just uttered, Whitehead kept his mouth wide open.</p>

  <p>Even the leader and elders of the White Ape race were dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The White Ape race had left the Sky Water City too long ago, so naturally, they didn't know much about the current situation in the city. It never crossed their minds that such a thing had happened before.</p>

  <p>"No, it's impossible..." Whitehead shook his head in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Why is it impossible? It's not just the Sky Water City. Now, even the entire Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore belongs to him. He is now the ruler of Stage Fourteen," said Feng Ge, who had come down from the city wall as well.</p>

  <p>However, as she was descending, she carried a small portion of the city wall on her shoulder. When she was finished speaking, she suddenly threw the piece of the city wall out.</p>

  <p>The piece smashed into a huge statue of a Star Falcon in the square nearby.</p>

  <p>This statue had stood there for countless years, yet now it was but a pile of rubble.</p>

  <p>"The ruler of..."</p>

  <p>"Is he the new stage ruler?"</p>

  <p>"So the one in the Dark Region..."</p>

  <p>The range of activities of purified beings was not limited to the Dark Region, so the creatures in the Light Region naturally knew about them.</p>

  <p>After all, they were the strongest in a certain stage of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"That one has already been killed." Feng Ge dusted off her hands nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Hanley and Tomas exchanged glances, each filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Finding Luo Zheng and Feng Ge in the Sky Water City was the worst news for the Star Falcon race right now.</p>

  <p>This meant that the Royal Monkey race had failed.</p>

  <p>However, deep in their hearts, both Hanley and Tomas deduced that the Royal Monkey race hadn't actually failed. Instead, the only logical explanation was the Royal Monkey race had been unable to ask the stage ruler to make a move. This was because if the stage ruler did make a move, there was no possible way these humans could have survived.</p>

  <p>If this was the case, the Star Falcon race still had hope!</p>

  <p>But according to Feng Ge, they had actually killed and even replaced the stage ruler.</p>

  <p>"Is that human woman telling the truth?" Hanley asked, his voice trembling.</p>

  <p>"It can't be true. She must be lying..." Tomas said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Even if she's lying, we can't keep our place in the Sky Water City," Hanley murmured. "If it's all true, then the Star Falcon race will be annihilated. We need to inform the others to flee..." Hanley spread his wings wide, ready to fly off.</p>

  <p>Whitehead, on the other hand, was still frozen in shock. Hanley and Tomas leapt into the sky, twittering loudly.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the rest of the members of the Star Falcon race in the entire Sky Water City followed suit and launched into the sky to follow the two elders. In a matter of seconds, the Sky Water City was completely abandoned.</p>

  <p>Their sudden departure left the remaining races, including the White Ape race, speechless.</p>

  <p>Today was supposed to be a great day for the White Ape race. However, when they had just marched into the city, the Star Falcon race had even chosen to abandon the city! Oh, the irony...</p>

  <p>"Your White Ape race was on good terms with the Li Shan mountain, so, supposedly, you could have returned to the Sky Water City without conflict." Luo Zheng paused, and then frowned. "Unfortunately, you made a grave mistake..." As Luo Zheng spoke, he reached out his hand and placed it gently on Whitehead's head.</p>

  <p>At this point, Whitehead didn't dare resist; he didn't even have the courage to run away. Wordlessly, he stood there, trembling. A deep sense of regret filled his heart.</p>

  <p>Because the Star Falcon race had fled so quickly, Whitehead figured that Luo Zheng was speaking the truth. 'I shouldn't have taken the trouble to try to please the Star Falcon race...' he thought with remorse.</p>

  <p>However, no medicine in this world could have healed him from this regret.</p>

  <p>Then a piercing sound came from above, and a lightning bolt arced through the air until it enveloped Whitehead in a sea of blinding light.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had disintegrated into fine, white dust in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing Whitehead's powdery remains, the rest of the White Ape race were filled with fear, as they anticipated Luo Zheng's punishment.</p>

  <p>They had all gotten into this mess because of Whitehead, but they had still been eager for success.</p>

  <p>From this point of view, every one of the White Ape race had offended Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Turning to the White Ape race, Luo Zheng shouted coldly, "Leave Sky Water City!"</p>

  <p>The leader of the White Ape race had been awaiting Luo Zheng's order. Upon hearing he was letting them go, he felt joy well up within him.</p>

  <p>Given the situation, it was already incredibly lucky for them to come out of the city alive.</p>

  <p>After the White Ape race had retreated from the Sky Water City, Yan and Natalie returned to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Eyeing Whitehead's remains, Natalie shook her head coldly. "This guy is lucky to have died this way. He killed Naomi, after all. If it were up to me, I'd have hacked him into pieces..."</p>

  <p>Yan also sighed. "May Naomi rest in peace."</p>

  <p>Since the Star Falcon race had left, there was no need for Luo Zheng to stay here.</p>

  <p>The Sky Water City was now a city with no leader. Even so, Luo Zheng couldn't possibly occupy the city by himself.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to return to the Myriad Spirits City, another three creatures of the Other Shore walked up to him. These three creatures represented the three large races only second to the Star Falcon race in the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>The purpose of these three races was very clear. Since Luo Zheng had driven away the Star Falcon race, he was now viewed as the owner of the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng couldn't manage such a large city alone, so it was best if he left it up to the three races to manage it for him.</p>

  <p>The actions of the three large races mirrored that of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race back in the Myriad Spirits City, but the difference was that the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race were more sincere. Before Luo Zheng even needed to give the order, the two races destroyed the Dark Bear race.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the three large races didn't dare take action while the Star Falcon race was still a threat. But now, the Star Falcon race had already fled.</p>

  <p>"You are too late." Luo Zheng cast an indifferent glance at them, and then proceeded to walk out of the city with Feng Ge and the others.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the three large races looked at each other. They were all quite perceptive, and instantly understood what Luo Zheng meant: he had already found a suitable candidate to manage the Sky Water City!</p>

  <p>"No matter who you choose, no one is more suitable than us. We are from the Sky Water City..." a leader tried to speak tactfully to Luo Zheng, in the hopes of changing his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stopped abruptly. Slowly, he turned to face the leader. In a cold voice, he said, "You should consider yourself lucky that the Star Falcon race decided to flee. Otherwise, the Sky Water City would've been a slaughterhouse. You wouldn't have been able to escape."</p>

  <p>The leader immediately shut up. Narrowing his eyes, Luo Zheng turned and proceeded to leave the city.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the distance, dozens of Souls of Light had gathered on the rooftops of several buildings in the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>These Souls of Light came from the Jin Wu, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race.</p>

  <p>As they watched Luo Zheng's receding figure in the distance, their faces fell.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! First the Myriad Spirits City, now the Sky Water City!"</p>

  <p>"What's worse, we even can't stay in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>"How did things get this far?"</p>

  <p>The fact that the Star Falcon race was expelled meant that they lost the Sky Water City, and that their days of prosperity were coming to an end. There might be no place in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore for them to stay.</p>
