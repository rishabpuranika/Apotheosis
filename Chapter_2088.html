<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2088 Infinite (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Dozens of supreme worlds were already torn apart while countless creatures had also died. The smell of blood and corpses decorated the battlefield.</p>

  <p>A lot of creatures, even innocent ones, were murdered in the war. The deaths included mortals from thousands of kingdoms up to emperors who had just ascended to the throne. Innocent lives like women who were just about to give birth and infants who had not even opened their eyes to look at the world were also lost. Even scholars who had only participated in the imperial examinations were also trapped and at death's door.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists paid attention to the war in the universe. But, many of the ordinary mortals still focused on their own lives. Even after they sighed over the strange phenomenon that occurred in the heavens and earth, they could only suffer in silence. They didn't want the war, and yet, their lives were still forfeited.</p>

  <p>The innocent creatures didn't know whether the supreme world where they stayed would be torn or not. Even if they knew the situation, they could not do anything about it. After all, it would be tough for them to leave a supreme world no matter how hard they tried. They were like ants on a large ship. Even if they knew that this ship would sink, they wouldn't be able to escape to another ship. Despair enveloped them as they remained crippled by their powerlessness.</p>

  <p>What was the point of their lives? How could weak and pathetic creatures like them continue to live in such a war-torn place?</p>

  <p>As the lowest-level secondary creatures, these mortals also pursued beautiful things. They wanted to thrive and be able to find love and a family.</p>

  <p>They pursued more beautiful women, more beautiful songs, higher status, more respected positions, as well as more gold, silver, and jewelry. To many people, that was the meaning of life.</p>

  <p>Then, what was the meaning of Zheng's life? Why was he born? Why was he still alive?</p>

  <p>Compared to those mortals, he might be far more powerful. He could easily dominate the destiny of mortals in tens of thousands of kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Such weak beings could be killed or subdued by him without a sweat.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng himself was a secondary creature of the universe.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Holy Beings of the divine land, he was no different from those mortals. He, too, was pathetic when compared to beings of a higher power.</p>

  <p>What about the True Gods and Holy Beings of the divine land?</p>

  <p>Compared to the extraordinary creatures, could it be that True Gods were just like mortals? Additionally, Holy Beings might also be as insignificant as the emperors of mortals?</p>

  <p>His mind was limitless, and so was the world...</p>

  <p>"Infinite..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a hint of realization in his heart. A new perception became embodied in his mind.</p>

  <p>After five minutes, a hint of a smile appeared on the corner of Zheng's mouth. The stiffness of his expression vanished and was replaced by a brave face.</p>

  <p>As he saw Zheng's gaze, Pranav was a bit shocked. Despair crept inside him as his heart sank.</p>

  <p>"It's for my own path. I continue to struggle for my own life path..." Luo Zheng uttered with a smile. The Great Weighty Sword in his hand moved slightly in the wind. His conviction became apparent in his expression.</p>

  <p>"What is your life path?" Pranav asked again as he wanted to stall for time.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng shook his head and smiled peculiarly at Pranav. "My life path is too remarkable and profound. It is on a level you can never achieve. You don't have the qualifications to know it!"</p>

  <p>As he finished his words, Luo Zheng swung the Great Weighty Sword. The mighty power poured out as his eyes were flooded with the malicious Mu Ning. He slashed out the Gods-intimidating Strike in a flash...</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Fresh blood splattered everywhere. The ground was painted red as the stench of a recent death filled the air. The sword intent created by the Gods-intimidating Strike passed through Pranav's body. It spread across the surface of the supreme world.</p>

  <p>The supreme world they were currently in was called "Autumn Mountain World". There were many mountains within that supreme world, and there were almost no plains. As Luo Zheng launched a sword strike, all the mountains within a radius of a thousand miles were slashed and flattened. All that was left was a vast and wide plain.</p>

  <p>Later on, Zheng's sword strike was vividly recorded by someone, and many warriors, even mortals, knew that Luo Zheng had killed a True God there. It was said that the blood of that True God had soaked into a particular part of the plain. Whoever could find the blood-soaked stone would be able to obtain the inheritance of that True God. It became a hunted treasure for warriors who wanted to strengthen themselves quickly. Thus countless warriors went there to dig and look for that stone, which made the entire plain full of bumps and hollows.</p>

  <p>As such, the plain was called the "God Slaying Plain".</p>

  <p>"How could you be so powerful? What kind of comprehension have you gained?" Xun asked as she floated nearby Luo Zheng. Her slender body curled up and leaned against Zheng's shoulder while she stared at him with a crooked face. Curiosity and a hint of fear were reflected in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been in a daze for a long time just then. Additionally, Zheng's behavior was extremely abnormal. Xun was afraid that he would spiral into madness.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine." Luo Zheng took a deep breath and raised his head to look at the sky.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he tightened his grip on the Great Weighty Sword. "There's only one more left…"</p>

  <p>After he murdered Pranav, Luo Zheng had finally realized his wish. At that moment, the power generated by the Wishing Spell had quickly disappeared from Zheng's body.</p>
