<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Zheng left the stone hall, he had cut a Holy Stone from the wall.</p>

  <p>It was a Holy Stone of the highest grade, even if it was just the size of a fist. The Light of Annihilation it released was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Zheng's own Holy Stone probably wouldn't be able to kill such a huge Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Buckling under the intensity of the Light of Annihilation, the Snake Spirit King's body collapsed. The three gemstones went down with him, vanishing into thin air.</p>

  <p>From the altar, the Snake Goddess and the others were so excited that they almost jumped up and down from happiness.</p>

  <p>After all, according to their original plan, the human race was not supposed to fight against the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's main opponent was the Monkey Spirit King, which was their strongest trump card.</p>

  <p>After the Monkey Spirit King was defeated and worse, cursed, they had lost their trump card. Theoretically, they had already been defeated.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, at the most critical moment, Zheng emerged from the altar with a sword that overpowered the Snake Spirit King!</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>After the Space Guiding Stone disappeared, the cubic spaces it had created began to lose their power.</p>

  <p>The square spaces that trapped Manuel and Tearrag were the first to explode. They regained their freedom.</p>

  <p>It took some struggling before their bodies returned to their original shapes.</p>

  <p>"It was suffocating me!"</p>

  <p>"Finally, I can breathe!"</p>

  <p>"That's the least important part! Zheng of the human race has defeated the Snake Spirit King!"</p>

  <p>While they might've been imprisoned, they were still able to observe the fight. They both witnessed how Zheng easily defeated the Snake Spirit King with a series of inconceivable attacks.</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters and snake spirits were stunned and confused.</p>

  <p>In particular, Sewell, Balfour, and the other Snake Masters were at a loss, since they were still under the impression that this was part of the Snake Spirit King's plan.</p>

  <p>After all, letting Zheng take out that sword was part of his plan.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, the Snake Spirit King should have had a way to take back the sword, so why was he defeated?</p>

  <p>This was too strange!</p>

  <p>However, no one made a move just yet. The Snake Masters, Monkey Masters, and Bird Masters were not in a hurry to fight. After all, they were not the key to the success of this battle, but Zheng and the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>After finally defeating the Snake Spirit King, Zheng looked up.</p>

  <p>A transparent ball was floating there, and the Snake Spirit King's coordinates were hidden within it.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to completely kill off the Snake Spirit King, he had to destroy this ball.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! That ball has a special power to protect it," the Snake Goddess cautioned.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Monkey Spirit King had gathered all the power contained in the necklace of teeth, almost destroying the ball and the coordinates within it.</p>

  <p>However, at that critical moment, a black light suddenly appeared and enveloped it. Both the ball itself and the black light were very strange.</p>

  <p>"A special power?"</p>

  <p>Zheng fixed his eyes on the ball.</p>

  <p>He could see the coordinates within the ball flashing with golden light.</p>

  <p>They contained a lot of energy, but the Snake Spirit King hadn't come back to life yet.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a few steps forward and waved his irregular heavy sword, its blade arcing gracefully in the air.</p>

  <p>A beam of half-moon-shaped sword radiance shot towards the ball.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about this sword radiance, but it should've been powerful enough to cut off the Snake Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the sword radiance had traveled tens of thousands of feet till it hit the ball.</p>

  <p>But the ball didn't react, as though it didn't exist. The sword radiance penetrated through it without a sound.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked. He wasn't surprised. Raising his heavy irregular sword, he whispered, "I'm counting on you."</p>

  <p>He could feel that the irregular heavy sword was eager to have a try.</p>

  <p>It was more than willing to end the Snake Spirit King's life.</p>

  <p>The power of space contained in the ball was quite mysterious and ever elusive, even the Bird Spirit King, who was proficient in the space rules, couldn't understand it.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng felt confident. The ancestry-level bloodline had a complete space-time quadrant. No matter how special the space power was, it couldn't avoid the ninety-three abilities in the space-time quadrant!</p>

  <p>Moreover, the irregular heavy sword could exert the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline to the extreme. Breaking the ball didn't pose a challenge to him.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a step backward, gearing up to slash another sword strike.</p>

  <p>Blue light flashed through the cracks on the heavy sword, and a mysterious space aura emanated from it, permeating the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>It was just as Zheng had thought, the irregular heavy sword had used as many as nineteen abilities of the space-time quadrant.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to slash forward, Sewell in the distance suddenly charged straight at him.</p>

  <p>Although he knew he was no match for Zheng, he had to at least try to save the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned, seeing Sewell from the corner of his eye. He took a step forward, and his figure appeared behind Sewell in a flash, like a ghost.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, he brandished the irregular long sword.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The sounds of swift sword slashes rang out.</p>

  <p>Before he could even cry out, Sewell's body had been cut into tens of thousands of triangles.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately took out the Holy Stone from his Sumeru Space, activated it, and released the Light of Annihilation. Sewell's body rapidly collapsed.</p>

  <p>The other Snake Masters gasped. Sewell was one of the top masters among Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Before, Sewell had managed to make a scene on the Night View Island on his own.</p>

  <p>Now, facing Zheng, he didn't even last for a few seconds!</p>

  <p>When the Monkey Masters, such as Manuel, Tearrag and Hagar saw this scene, they trembled slightly. Since they were always the bellicose ones, they couldn't help but compare themselves to Sewell.</p>

  <p>They had always been keenly aware of the gap between their strength and Sewell's. After all, they had been staying on the Night View Island for so many years.</p>

  <p>If they were to face Zheng, they would probably lose even more miserably.</p>

  <p>At this moment, they felt lucky and heaved sighs of relief. Fortunately for them, Zheng had gone to the Night View Island and sided with them.</p>

  <p>After killing Sewell, Zheng once again held up his long sword.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The sword radiance, which had gathered the power of nineteen abilities of the space-time quadrant, flashed and went straight for the floating ball.</p>

  <p>While the sword radiance wasn't particularly fast, the ball made no attempt to dodge it.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>This time, the sword radiance, which contained the power of space, did not penetrate through the ball, but made a cut on its surface.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Hairline cracks appeared on the surface of the ball, slowly climbing along its sides.</p>

  <p>The ball was sturdier than Zheng had imagined, so without any hesitation, he slashed out more sword radiance at it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, from within the ball, a fierce dispute was taking place within the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.</p>

  <p>"You asked me to release that guy, but now, he's about to finish me off!</p>

  <p>You have to give me more strength!</p>

  <p>Otherwise, we will die together!"</p>

  <p>At death's door, the Snake Spirit King was extremely desperate.</p>

  <p>By now, they could hear the sound of the ball breaking. The Snake Spirit King grew even more nervous and started shouting, "That guy is attacking the ball!"</p>

  <p>However, the black light remained silent.</p>

  <p>It had been giving orders to the Snake Spirit King behind the scenes this whole time.</p>

  <p>However, after Zheng took out that sword, the black light had felt that the Snake Spirit King was of no more use to it.</p>

  <p>It could easily take over the Other Shore and the primitive land built by the Snake Spirit King. After all, Cornelius had only gotten thus far thanks to it.</p>

  <p>Thus, it had decided that it was a good choice to let the Snake Spirit King die in Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>However, while the Snake Spirit King was begging, the black light changed its mind. "Don't worry. Of course I won't watch you die."</p>

  <p>"Then what should I do?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King heaved a sigh of relief, satisfied that the black light finally responded.</p>

  <p>"Show your full strength," the black light said calmly.</p>

  <p>"But my strength is not enough to face him," the Snake Spirit King said in confusion.</p>

  <p>"It's enough now," the black light responded cryptically.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's coordinates were originally pure golden, but after the black light finished speaking, pure black light beams crawled around the coordinates like deathly earthworms.</p>
