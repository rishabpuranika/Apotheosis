<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 505 The Malicious Mu Ning Crystal (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had resisted Bryson's flying swords attack easily with his bodily strength. In fact, he had beaten Bryson so hard that the latter had gotten seriously injured. This had shocked the members of the Luo family, who were now, admiring Zheng's strength heavily.</p>

  <p>Initially, they had thought highly of Luo Zheng, but just like what had happened in the All Peaks Competition, no one really believed that Luo Zheng could defeat Dick of the Illuminating Soul Realm with his strength at a mere grade 2 of the nature level.</p>

  <p>However, that was then. Right now, Luo Zheng was at grade 3 of the nature level but he was facing an opponent at the Illuminating Soul Realm, the Blood Prisoner, wanted by the government and chased for a long time by Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Unless someone actually witnessed it, it would have been impossible to believe the outcome.</p>

  <p>After the blood streaks released by the Blood Prisoner entangled Zheng's arm, they tried to enter Zheng's skin, like several thousand worms or centipedes trying to crawl inside.</p>

  <p>His own refined blood as well as strong malicious Mu Ning was hidden in those streaks, which could even cut into an iron plate several centimeters thick. The Blood Prisoner could suck the flesh and blood from people whose body had been engulfed by those powerful rope-like streaks. But that was under usual circumstances.</p>

  <p>Normally, the person whose blood and flesh were swallowed by him would have become a shrunken, sucked skeleton, miserable and quite dead.</p>

  <p>"Scream, Bloke. Let out your sad and shrill cries!" The Blood Prisoner's terrible face without any skin on it shrieked and showed a merciless smile.</p>

  <p>But just as his streaks tried to enter Zheng's body, the Blood Prisoner suddenly felt that something was horribly wrong.</p>

  <p>This time, his invincible blood streaks couldn't penetrate this pathetic man's skin.</p>

  <p>How was that possible!</p>

  <p>To be honest, the Blood Prisoner experienced more of Zheng's strength than Bryson.</p>

  <p>Bryson had tried to kill Luo Zheng with his flying swords, which were being controlled only with a little bit of life vitality. After the swords had bounced away from Zheng's body, Bryson had thought that it was impossible and was wondering whether Luo Zheng had a special treasure to protect his body.</p>

  <p>But the Blood Prisoner had directly used the blood streaks made from his own life vitality to penetrate Zheng's skin. He could have directly gathered the information reflected from those blood streaks. The intensity and the strength of Zheng's skin was far beyond his expectation. His all-conquering blood streaks were completely ineffective on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the Blood Prisoner was stunned, Luo Zheng sneered, "You must be tired from all that floating about in the air. Why don't you come down!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he made a fist with his hand entangled by the blood streaks and pulled with his mighty strength which had surprised even the Blood Prisoner himself. At the same time, he threw a punch at the ground severely.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The great force with which his hand hit the ground left a big hole. Before the sound of this punch could be completely dissipated, another loud bang was heard. The Blood Prisoner, pulled down from midair by Zheng's heave, fell heavily on the ground at a furious pace and made that second bang.</p>

  <p>Countless cracks appeared on the ground and a human-shaped hole got indented not far away from Luo Zheng. From the hole the disgusting smell of blood started rising continuously.</p>

  <p>After a short while, a volcano of blood burst out from that hole suddenly and it splashed on the ground all over the periphery of that hole. The slate on the ground blackened immediately, and several furious hisses could be heard. In an instant, the slate melted. The blood volcano had a strong corroding effect.</p>

  <p>In no time, a hand made of pure blood reached out from the hole. When the Blood Prisoner emerged, he was covered completely by a layer of crimson-colored light, so akin to blood as to be easily confusable with it.</p>

  <p>He was like a creature which had been born in a blood pool.</p>

  <p>"I am surprised. Can a simple disciple of Cloud Sect be so powerful?</p>

  <p>You are just at grade 3 of the nature level, but you can force me to burn my blood and do such a miracle!" The prisoner's face was also covered with that disgusting light and only red slits were visible where his eyes should have been. At that moment, he didn't look like human anymore, but a blood ogre.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Blood Prisoner had changed and the momentum on his body had increased greatly, Luo Zheng was also astonished.</p>

  <p>It appeared that the killing way was really a shortcut. If it was not so easy to be swallowed by the malicious Mu Ning when practicing in the killing way, nobody knew how many warriors in the world would take this way.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner was only at grade 1 of the Illuminating Soul Realm, and his foundation was not as steady as the disciples of Cloud Sect, but he could promote his strength greatly after he used the secret method to arouse the malicious Mu Ning in his body.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew how many creatures the Blood Prisoner had killed across his years of practicing and hiding. Each time he killed someone, he could accumulate more malicious Mu Ning which he could later utilize. With that in mind, Luo Zheng really was not in the mood to talk with him. He moved suddenly and started a weird step. Lifting the Streamer Sword in his hand lightly, he chopped his enemy, hoping to end him once and for all.</p>

  <p>"Die!" The sharp Streamer Sword chopped with a silver radiance and the blade rushed towards the Blood Prisoner.</p>

  <p>"That's going to be of no use." The Blood Prisoner waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Layers upon layers of blood-colored crystals suddenly emerged from his arm, like blood-red emeralds and formed a thick armor on his arm. There was a strong malicious Mu Ning hidden in each of those crystals and the sword couldn't possibly cut through them all.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword radiance chopped several crystals to pieces but was blocked at last.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner sneered, "Your strength really surprises me, but you are bound to be my delicacy!"</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>Six blood-red bone spikes emerged from the Blood Prisoner's body instantly. Each of them was several feet long, and resembled the disgusting legs of a spider. They surrounded Luo Zheng immediately.</p>

  <p>"Be a part of my blood and flesh!" The Blood Prisoner ordered and laughed wildly. The six bone spikes tried to hit Luo Zheng!</p>
