  <p>
</p>

  <p>In just a short while, Lowell was able to completely devour the piece of slate. He then clasped his hands and stood up.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared in his eyes as he looked at the mid-rank True God's corpse.</p>

  <p>All of this went totally against nature.</p>

  <p>However, since he had chosen this road, his belief had now become stronger and there was no way he was going to change. Everything he did went towards his goal. Anything or anyone that stood in his way would be eliminated.</p>

  <p>"From a whole point of view, you... died for this battered boat," he murmured.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to leave, a very small and very weak voice spoke from behind him.</p>

  <p>"Help, help me..."</p>

  <p>The sound made Lowell frown.</p>

  <p>He turned around and noticed a tiny hole on the wall. It seemed the sound was coming from there.</p>

  <p>"A high-level breath-restraining technique? Or are you using a special treasure that helps you restrain your breath?"</p>

  <p>There was no way he would miss a living person on the other side of the wall. The only explanation for this was that the person's hiding skill was exceptional and ingenious.</p>

  <p>A strong killing intent appeared within Lowell's eyes as he lightly patted the wall.</p>

  <p>His touch was light but it was enough to make the stone collapse.</p>

  <p>A compartment was revealed behind the wall, as high as half a person. A girl, around fifteen to sixteen years of age, was curled up inside.</p>

  <p>The girl was covered with tulle and she held onto her legs for warmth.</p>

  <p>Her entire body was littered with bruises and dust but she was surprisingly pretty. However, despite her beauty, her eyes looked dead and she looked more like an abandoned doll than a person.</p>

  <p>"This layer of tulle..."</p>

  <p>Lowell reached down and took off the tulle that covered her. "It is a very rare treasure. It might not be possible for even a first-tier clan to own it..."</p>

  <p>"Help me, please..." the girl pleaded again.</p>

  <p>"Did you see that?" Lowell stared at the girl and asked.</p>

  <p>The girl quickly shook her head. "I didn't see anything!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Lowell smiled. "You're lying. I can't save you. Goodbye."</p>

  <p>Leaving the girl there, Lowell leapt up and climbed onto the patio, disappearing before her eyes.</p>

  <p>His disappearance crushed any hope that remained in that young girl's heart. She wrapped her arms around her and squeezed her body tight.</p>

  <p>Her mouth visibly trembled, afraid that she might cry out loud because of helplessness.</p>

  <p>She should've never asked that man for help.</p>

  <p>He could eat the Hundred Commandments Slate but he did not even have the heart to save others. That cloaked man could've been saved by him had he wanted to.</p>

  <p>He even took away her precious tulle which meant that her breath would no longer be shielded from the horrible insects.</p>

  <p>"Rustling, rustling, rustling..."</p>

  <p>The rustling sounds from above made her heart beat a mile.</p>

  <p>They moved towards her bit by bit, like the many legs of oncoming death.</p>

  <p>"My bodyguard is dead, and so are the others. It seems I am fated to die as well..." she murmured to herself.</p>

  <p>Just three days ago, her family was still together. She was the apple of her parents' eyes and had servants at her every beck and call. Now she was all alone, and she was about to die.</p>

  <p>"Rustling..."</p>

  <p>Black and red scutigers emerged from the wall and slowly crawled towards her, entering through the hole Lowell had made earlier.</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes, trying to calm herself. Perhaps death wouldn't be so bad.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to resign herself to her fate, the unthinkable happened.</p>

  <p>"Click! Click..."</p>

  <p>Something small dropped at the foot of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>When she opened her eyes, she saw a bright flame, similar to fireworks, erupting in small explosions in front of her.</p>

  <p>"Rustling..."</p>

  <p>Because of the fire starter, all the scutigers had scattered, running wildly in all directions and disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The sight of such wondrous flame stunned her and she couldn't help but look at it in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>There was a small explosion as Lowell appeared in front of her again. He only sighed before offering his hand to her.</p>

  <p>"You... you came back to save me?" she muttered in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why? Do you want to die now?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>"But I saw..." The sight of Lowell devouring the Hundred Commandments Slate shocked her. Who was this incredible person that could eat this rigid slate was what she thought.</p>

  <p>"You're honest," Lowell said, pulling her up and gently putting her onto his back. He then kicked the fire starter up and caught it with his mouth.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward, the scenery became a blur and the two of them shuttled out of this fallen city at an extremely fast speed. Her slender legs merely swayed at the crook of his arms.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" Lowell asked, with the fire starter still in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"My name is Iris Dongfang," she answered.</p>

  <p>Her answer shocked him and Lowell couldn't help but slow down. "Are you from the main Dongfang Clan? Or from a branch family?"</p>

  <p>The main Dongfang Clan, much like the Han Clan, had also moved to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>However, the situation of the two clans remained somewhat different.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan relied on the Ray Tree, and had many branches.</p>

  <p>The main Dongfang Clan led by Nicholas was indeed bigger than those branches. After the main clan entered the Floating Island though, the branch on the Ray Tree soon grew wealthy and influential, with three Holy Beings that served as their foundation of power stronger than other great clans.</p>

  <p>"A branch..." Iris Dongfang murmured.</p>

  <p>Lowell's eyes narrowed in regret and a killing intent surged in his heart.</p>

  <p>He initially thought that this girl belonged to the He Clan but, to his surprise, she was actually from the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>He shouldn't have saved her. He needed to kill her.</p>

  <p>They had left Jade Bone Divine City. Just as they came to the edge of the crater, Lowell saw the need to put Iris Dongfang down.</p>

  <p>As the girl had sensed what was about to happen, a trace of sadness once again appeared on her face. "You want to kill me, don't you?" she asked Lowell, looking at him straight in the eye.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied emotionlessly.</p>

  <p>Had she been from a small clan then he might've been able to save her.</p>

  <p>However, she was a member of the Dongfang Clan which completely changed everything.</p>

  <p>A look of grief crossed over Iris Dongfang's beautiful features and she could only let her eyes speak for her as she looked at Lowell sadly. He put his hand on her forehead and all she could feel was the coldness of his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I can swear by my inner demon...</p>

  <p>I will always follow what you say.</p>

  <p>I won't resist or disclose your secret. Please," she continued pleading with him.</p>

  <p>Lowell practiced the Justice Godly Way and was someone who pursued the idea of justice supremacy, but the concept of justice itself was split between absolute and limited. Even in the debate over the Godly Ways, there was no right conclusion.</p>

  <p>Limited justice would dictate he kill her for the greater good of more people.</p>

  <p>However, according to absolute justice, there was absolutely no reason for him to kill her.</p>

  <p>Lowell looked at her eyes as he battled himself internally.</p>

  <p>She did not say anything and merely looked back at him pitifully.</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>Lowell heaved a sigh. "Be with me from now on. Swear by your inner demon and I will not kill you."</p>

  <p>Iris Dongfang nodded and smiled up at him like a child in relief.</p>
