<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1113 The Arrogant Little Monster </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After Zheng's victory, all of the divine-level talents of the four divine kingdoms became speechless. Most of them became evidently listless and restless.</p>

  <p>They might have had the impulse to challenge Luo Zheng after his fight against Logan, but after what just happened, any warrior with even the littlest self-awareness would understand that they would never measure up to him, even if they tried, for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>Such a sentiment was understandable— Luo Zheng was able to survive, even under such terrifyingly powerful flames! He didn't obtain any kind of injury, and the only thing he lost was his clothes. Due to this, many people had started suspecting that Luo Zheng was not a human at all, or that his body was made up of some unknown substance. After all, Luo Zheng being unharmed was just totally illogical.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Luo Zheng didn't care one bit about how any of them felt. After the golden runes disappeared, Zheng's body had already become a sacred weapon. More importantly, there was still a considerable amount of primordial energy in his body that he could use to further refine his already invincible body.</p>

  <p>Although going through body refinement was painful, he would happily bear it as doing so would bring tremendous benefits to him as a warrior.</p>

  <p>With his eyes closed, Luo Zheng began stretching his body. Slowly, he felt that he had entered a new level. A hint of joy appeared on his face before he opened his eyes and gazed at Randy, Turner and the others on the platform.</p>

  <p>Joy overflowing on his face, Randy gave Luo Zheng a thumbs-up. Luo Zheng nodded slightly and looked around, asking in a clear voice, "Who else wants to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>The Wind Divine Kingdom had failed. The next step was for the Star Field Divine Kingdom or the York Divine Kingdom to send their best warriors to challenge him.</p>

  <p>With the current situation, the most unhappy ones were the warriors from the Star Field Divine Kingdom. Ever since the beginning, they had never won a match. Although the Wind Divine Kingdom had lost, War King Wind had only sent one warrior to fight Luo Zheng, and that was Fiona.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Fiona had lost, the strength she displayed was already enough to prove her worth. In the younger generation of the four divine kingdoms, there weren't many people who would dare say that they were match for her!</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng defeated Logan and Fiona, the warriors that were ranked in the first tier of their own martial houses didn't dare come up. Even with their current level of strength, they knew that they would be instantly defeated by Luo Zheng. They would only bring shame to themselves and their martial houses.</p>

  <p>Actually, the crown princes of the four divine kingdoms had the opportunity to challenge and defeat Luo Zheng. The thing was, no one knew if any of them would take that step forward.</p>

  <p>Just as the imperial members of the Star Field Divine Kingdom were considering this, someone had already stepped out. This person was none other than that little monster from the Nine Furnace Martial House.</p>

  <p>There were so many top warriors within the York Divine Kingdom, including some from the Nine Furnace Martial House. Their strength was not necessarily inferior to Logan's, but only the little monster dared to come forward.</p>

  <p>He bent his waist and suddenly jumped up. His entire body flipped in the air and instantly disappeared into the enchanted barrier. His gaze revealed an intense interest in Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's finally the little monster's turn to fight. I wonder if that brutal fellow will receive a lesson this time!"</p>

  <p>"That little monster being taught a lesson? You know, I want to see that too, but have you ever seen him lose before?"</p>

  <p>"No, never..."</p>

  <p>Even the warriors from the Nine Furnace Martial House didn't like the little monster. Even the Nine Furnace Martial House wouldn't be willing to bring the little monster here, but they had to use his power to gain more benefits in the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Well, the truth was that the York Divine Kingdom didn't plan to send out the little monster to fight others at all. In the past, when they had a competition before the Feather Holy Sea was to be opened, the little monster had lain on the ground and slept soundly. The battles between warriors had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Marine personally summoned the little monster to deal with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the sight of what was happening, an extremely complicated expression colored Marine's face. She did not know whether she had done the right thing or not.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows furrowed the moment he saw the little monster approach.</p>

  <p>He hated the kind of gaze he was giving him. But after Fiona's reminder, his vigilance heightened.</p>

  <p>While Fiona's strength was already extremely astonishing, she was still very afraid of the little monster. This fellow's strength definitely could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng understood that the reason of Fiona's fear of the little monster was not solely because of his strength— it was also because his personality.</p>

  <p>The moment the little monster landed in the fighting area, he smacked his lips and stared at Luo Zheng slyly. "Can I challenge you?" he asked, his eyes locked on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied nonchalantly, "Since you're already standing here, I don't think there's any other choice left but that. Why do you still ask?"</p>

  <p>The little monster's long neck shrunk and his smile became more menacing. He replied, "If you lose, can I kill you?"</p>

  <p>The little monster was starting to talk so much nonsense that Luo Zheng could only narrow his eyes in annoyance. In a cold tone, he replied,</p>

  <p>"According to the rules, you're not allowed."</p>

  <p>"That's too bad," the little monster said, his tone mocking. "I don't know how to fight, and I only know how to kill. What should I do?" The little monster stared at Luo Zheng with his unblinking black eyes as he laughed in a sinister way. He was ready to kill.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng only smiled and said, "Well, as you know, there's no absolute guarantee in a fight. I think we should start!" Trash talking was not something he was interested in. Also, he was too lazy to waste his breath on the little monster.</p>

  <p>"Alright then!" the little monster replied, twisting his mouth into a wide, malicious smile. His teeth were suddenly exposed and they didn't look like human teeth at all. They were crisscrossed and exceptionally sharp, as if they were the teeth of some wild beast.</p>

  <p>Without any warning, he rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not one bone in Luo Zheng liked the little monster. His face was full of disgust as he watched him running towards him. Truly, he already despised the little monster from the bottom of his heart despite only meeting him a few minutes ago!</p>

  <p>Despite the surge of such emotion in him, Luo Zheng couldn't understand why he had such emotion towards his new opponent.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The little monster suddenly leapt high into the air. His strange smile was still plastered on his face as he descended on Luo Zheng, his hands out.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure flashed, passing through space in the blink of an eye, avoiding the little monster's grasp. However, he started feeling baffled by what was happening. Would the little monster really fight him head on?</p>

  <p>After the little monster went up on stage, he didn't take out a weapon or use any life vitality. He was only relying on his bare hands to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He even gave up on flying and just ran on the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, whose body was now a sacred weapon, was quite confident. If the little monster wanted to engage in a close combat with him, he would happily oblige. It was just that he didn't know what was on the little monster's mind, so he chose to stay alert.</p>

  <p>The little monster missed with his attack and fell back onto the enchanted barrier. He then clucked his tongue and said, "Your strength and talent are not bad, but you are too timid!"</p>

  <p>Hearing his provocation, Luo Zheng became even more vigilant. 'What does this guy mean? Does he really intend to fight me with his physical body?' he thought.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to think too much about it!" The little monster grinned and said, "Against you, I don't even need to use my life vitality! I will just use my physical strength!"</p>

  <p>After the little monster spoke, the onlookers began to discuss among themselves. They were well aware that the little monster was very powerful. Strictly speaking, although he was a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he was not on the same level as these divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>However, everyone had clearly seen the power that Luo Zheng had. He was so formidable that even the Genuine Phoenix could do nothing to him!</p>

  <p>Wasn't it a bit too much for the little monster to say such a thing?</p>

  <p>At the little monster's words, a strange smile suddenly appeared on Zheng's face. "You don't seem to be a body refiner and don't have any forceful energy."</p>

  <p>"You're right. To deal with you, I do not need the forceful energy!" the little monster said again.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Instantly, Luo Zheng soared, quickly reaching the peak of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>When warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm fought against each other, their battle space was always too small. Therefore, the Soul Sea Realm master had set up a large enchanted barrier. After reaching the peak, Luo Zheng looked down on the little monster below. He then asked with a cunning smile, "If that's the case, how do you plan on fighting me?"</p>

  <p>"You!" The little monster's expression suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>Even without life vitality, the explosive strength of the little monster's body was still very strong. The problem was Luo Zheng had pulled away from him, and the little monster couldn't even reach him.</p>

  <p>If it was another warrior who wanted to compete with him in terms of physical strength, Luo Zheng would certainly agree to such a request. Whether it was forceful energy, life vitality, or physical strength, Luo Zheng was not afraid of it at all. However, he could not bear to watch the little monster act so arrogantly in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>There were plenty of people who disliked the little monster. Even though many divine-level talents were able to break through their bottlenecks and obtain great benefits by sparring with him, the little monster was not someone whom many people liked. Well, how many people would like a guy who not only looked like a monster, but also had a cruel and erratic temperament?</p>

  <p>Seeing that the little monster was at a loss as to what to reply to Zheng's words, everyone took the opportunity to laugh. It was this laughter that made the little monster embarrassed and angry beyond measure.</p>
