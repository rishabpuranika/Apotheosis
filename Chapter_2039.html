<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2039 Ice Sculptures </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With the icy-blue flame gripped in his hand, Luo Luo Zheng killed all approaching enemies as he traveled in the Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>Any martial artists who stood in his way were left to fend for themselves against the ice flame.</p>

  <p>Only a few martial artists had the ability of using the Fire Law to resist the Ice Soul Flame for a while. However, the Ice Soul Flame was a mystery comprehended by a Holy Being. It was actually what made Holy Jay famous. How in the world could these Sacred world lords resist it in the end?</p>

  <p>A warrior who cultivated the Fire Law produced golden flames and managed to resist the Ice Soul Flame. It didn't last long though, and the fire was soon consumed by the Ice Soul Flame, and the inner world in his cinnabar field was completely frozen. He could only stare at Luo Luo Zheng with pleading eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's movement gradually slowed as he took a look at the Sacred martial artist. In his eyes, the Sacred martial artist was quickly wrapped up by the Ice Soul Flame and turned into an ice sculpture. There seemed to be no breaths or signs of life in him anymore.</p>

  <p>Once he got closer, Luo Luo Zheng lightly tapped the ice sculpture with his index finger. In an instant, countless cracks began to form across the frozen body, which eventually shattered into a pile of ice on the ground.</p>

  <p>"What a bold move from this kid!"</p>

  <p>"This guy actually dared to attack us at the Iron Moon City!"</p>

  <p>"Kill him!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's actions brought attention to half of the Sacred warriors in the Iron Moon City. One after another, they rushed towards the street and quickly surrounded Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Luo Zheng!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>"He has arrived at the Iron Moon City!" another screamed.</p>

  <p>"The current Luo Luo Zheng is so strong now. A few years ago, he was only at the Soul Sea Realm. Now, he can kill a world lord with just a wave of his hand!"</p>

  <p>The humans and warriors from various races finally recognized Luo Luo Zheng, and some world lords who recognized him had all sorts of feelings that welled up inside their hearts. Back in the Illusion Battlefield, Luo Luo Zheng was still a mere Soul Sea Realm martial artist, while they had already been world lords for hundreds or even thousands of years. In a span of a few years, he attained so much power which was hard to comprehend.</p>

  <p>There were around seventy Sacred warriors gathered in front of Luo Luo Zheng, all of whom were world lords. However, when they saw the ice sculptures of the Sacred warriors behind Luo Luo Zheng, no one dared to charge forward.</p>

  <p>Hearing his name made them even more flustered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the strongest Godly Genius in the Evolutionary Universe, a title that was well-deserved. He might not be as strong as Maha, but he was definitely stronger than any ordinary world lord known.</p>

  <p>Seeing all these Sacred martial artists, Luo Luo Zheng was still indifferent. He raised his right hand, and the fist-sized Ice Soul Flame suddenly flickered. The wispy blue flame shot into the sky which instantly lowered the temperature of the entire Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>As for the Sacred martial artists, they all took a step back and watched in awe.</p>

  <p>"It turns out that Sacred warriors are also so afraid of death," Luo Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this brought much displeasure to the martial artists. One of them, a tall fellow, stood up and said, "Luo Luo Zheng, if you want to challenge us, then let's head up the mountain. One-on-one. How about it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took one look at the martial artist and glared. He had a temper, and he didn't care about any rules when facing Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>"I accept the challenge," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile, "but I will fight a group of you, alone."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng finished his words, a piercing golden light shot out from his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Soul Imprint within his Gold Fighting Soul let out an intense energy. This Mu Ning was not in line with Luo Zheng's natural temperament, but it was enough to greatly suppress world lords. This technique was even comparable to Maha's Great Dominance Technique!</p>

  <p>A majestic Mu Ning began to spread out and all of the Sacred martial artists felt their souls being suppressed. Some got headaches, some lost vision, and some were borderline about to faint.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng's figure flashed as he grabbed the Ice Soul Flame in his hand and shot toward the Sacred martial artists!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>He did not hesitate at all. The moment he approached them, he immediately swept the Ice Soul Flame past them and let the wispy flames engulf them. In the blink of an eye, the Ice Soul Flame took over all their bodies.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, most of the Sacred martial artists were consumed in the Ice Soul Flame. Only a handful of them had powerful soul forces and were quick enough to use Grand Teleportation to escape.</p>

  <p>"Crackle! Crackle..."</p>

  <p>The icy-blue Ice Soul Flame emitted a beautiful, cold glow as it danced around the martial artists in harmony.</p>

  <p>As this happened, the temperature in Iron Moon City plummeted once again.</p>

  <p>The Sunflower Water World used to be a place where spring reigned throughout the years. But as of the moment, it was as if the Iron Moon City turned into a Land of Extreme Chillness. Most warriors and mortals were shivering, rubbing their hands together in search for warmth.</p>

  <p>As for the human world lords behind Luo Luo Zheng, they could only stare at him with their mouths wide open.</p>

  <p>There were so many Sacred world lords who planned to attack Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Initially, they planned to help him, but they didn't expect that all of the Sacred world lords would be turned into ice sculptures in such a short time.</p>

  <p>"This... This fellow is inconceivably strong!"</p>

  <p>"He's powerful, no doubt. He has the strength of a Supreme Lord... but he doesn't have a Heavenly Destiny."</p>

  <p>"Are you stupid!? Luo Luo Zheng is already a Godly Genius. If he cultivated the Divine Dao, then he would be more powerful than anyone with Heavenly Destiny."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! Maha couldn't be trying to escape with his tail between his legs, right!?"</p>

  <p>All the human warriors who were in shock, began to cheer him on.</p>

  <p>Those martial artists who came to Sunflower Water World to challenge the Sacred warriors were usually calm and brave. They weren't afraid of death, but were afraid of dying cowards. Now, after being suppressed by the Sacred race for so long, Luo Luo Zheng finally gave them a sense of hope.</p>

  <p>After all the martial artists were turned into ice, Luo Luo Zheng stomped his foot and a huge power erupted. It was as if a huge meteor crashed into the Iron Moon City, causing the entire city to shake.</p>

  <p>This vibration rippled like a wave and made its way towards the ice sculptures. Just then, like the first sculpture they witnessed, cracks appeared on the bodies and all the frozen figures shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng exhaled slightly, and turned to one of the human warriors, "Where is Nathan's corpse?"</p>

  <p>When the human warrior heard Luo Zheng's question, he tried his best to hide his excitement and pointed towards the hill at the side of Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>"Over there! But... It's very likely that there wouldn't be much left. It might have been divided by the wolves!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow furrowed in disappointment as he heard this. He instantly ran out of Iron Moon City and landed on the hill. As he narrowed his eyes, he caught sight of four silver wolves.</p>

  <p>Just as the warrior said, Nathan's body had already been devoured by these silver wolves. Not much was left behind except blood and bones.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's blood began to boil at the sight of this.</p>

  <p>At the start of it all, Nathan and Luo Luo Zheng were enemies. However, they soon found a common ground and formed a camaraderie like no other.</p>

  <p>Seeing Nathan getting feasted on was a sight he couldn't bear to see. He was sad and angry, and Luo Luo Zheng rarely felt this.</p>

  <p>He rose into the sky and fell down like a shooting star, smashing straight towards the Silver Moon Wolves.</p>

  <p>It turned out, the Silver Moon Wolves were super legendary beasts.</p>

  <p>Although they were not fully grown, they were still incredibly strong.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng appeared in the air, they caught sight of him and lowered their bodies. The wolves placed their heads close to the ground, staring at him with their eyes...</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could even get close, the Silver Moon Wolves already had a plan. They leapt up into the air all together, and began biting towards Luo Zheng's neck, arms, and legs.</p>

  <p>These Silver Moon Wolves' teeth flashed with a metallic luster, and the tips of their teeth were extremely sharp. They could definitely break any divine weapon once it got in between their teeth. Ordinary world lords stood no chance against them.</p>

  <p>The wolves were smart, thinking they could tear Luo Luo Zheng into shreds.</p>

  <p>But they underestimated him, mistaking him for a mere human.</p>

  <p>"Crack crack crack crack?"</p>

  <p>With a few crisp sounds, Luo Luo Zheng let the Silver Moon Wolves bite him.</p>

  <p>However, the wolves soon noticed that they couldn't hurt him. One of the Silver Moon Wolves even had two of its teeth broken.</p>
