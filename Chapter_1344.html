<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The second page of the scroll wasn't even a secret in the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>The tradition had been passed down through the generations of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>When an old leader of the Mist Palace left his post, he usually left behind one of his treasures and placed it in the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>These three weapons belonged to the previous three leaders of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Even first-rank divine weapons would be classified according to quality.</p>

  <p>The divine weapons of the previous leaders were naturally more powerful and much better than ordinary first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>So the rule was that if one wanted to place the first-rank divine weapons on the first page into the dome, they had to pay one hundred life vitality jades and they could then choose any four weapons to place in the dome.</p>

  <p>But if one wanted to place the first-rank divine weapons of the second page into the dome, they also had to pay one hundred life vitality jades, but could only choose one weapon.</p>

  <p>Zheng observed these three weapons carefully.</p>

  <p>Of the three weapons, two were sabers— the Positive Energy Saber and the Flame Shadow Saber!</p>

  <p>Zheng had never practiced saber skills, which meant that sabers weren't suitable for him. He casually browsed through them, his eyes skimming over the picture.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng's gaze fell on the last weapon.</p>

  <p>A sword.</p>

  <p>"The Thunder Wind Divine Sword!"</p>

  <p>This sword was five feet long.</p>

  <p>The force of the sword was like the wind, and the attack of the sharp sword like the thunder.</p>

  <p>"I used this sword for two hundred thousand years in the universe and when I left my post, I placed it in the Weapon House.</p>

  <p>Those who are lucky to meet this weapon can get it with their own strength.</p>

  <p>I wish the one who obtains this sword is able to achieve greater things with the help of this sword."</p>

  <p>Zheng read the text underneath the sword. Those words had probably been left behind by the previous leader of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Once he had finished reading, Zheng's eyes flashed. He pulled out one hundred life vitality jades from his space ring and handed them over to the white-eyebrowed elder.</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder smiled and asked, "Have you chosen the weapon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Zheng, nodding.</p>

  <p>"What have you chosen? I'll release it for you," the white-eyebrowed elder said, his smile steady.</p>

  <p>Zheng pointed and said, "I want the Thunder Wind Divine Sword."</p>

  <p>The elder's smile vanished. "This sword has been left behind by the leader before last," he said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Has this leader undergone the Five Aging Processes?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng was just a young man, and the time scale of the Upper World was way different from what he could imagine. It was likely that the previous leader had entered the Five Aging Processes since leaving his post.</p>

  <p>Zheng, in way of inquiring about the Five Aging Processes, had a different motive. He wanted to ask if the leader had died.</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder sighed and shook his head. "No. This is a sword left behind by Master Xiao, one of the previous leaders of the Mist Palace. Not only did he not fall into the Five Aging Processes, he is probably trying to break through to become a Supreme Lord."</p>

  <p>"Breaking through to become a Supreme Lord!" Zheng said sharply.</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder nodded but did not say anything else. He gently flicked his finger and a blue light appeared in the dome.</p>

  <p>There were many dots of white light floating under the dome and there were four red light dots on the higher layer of the dome. But the blue light dot was floating at the highest point of the dome!</p>

  <p>"Blue, blue light dot! This guy has actually chosen the divine weapon on the second page!"</p>

  <p>"How can there be blue light dot? I can only see dots of red light, that too, occasionally. I've never seen anyone successfully take out a first-rank divine weapon. This is still the first time I've seen this blue light dot!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. It's impossible to take away a weapon on the second page!</p>

  <p>Obtaining a first-rank divine weapon on the first page is still possible.</p>

  <p>But first-rank divine weapons of the second page? Everyone has a lot of life vitality jades, but who would be so silly to spend so many on such a challenge?"</p>

  <p>"This guy is too arrogant. I don't think he even thought of taking a first-rank divine weapon. He's just spending one hundred life vitality jades getting a chance to have a look at it!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors looked at the dot of blue light above their heads, the light hum of their discussion growing into a quiet roar.</p>

  <p>Rhydian's and Matteo's smiles grew wider. "I've been in the Mist Palace for a long time but I've never seen any idiot placing a weapon of the second page into the dome. That guy is absolutely ignorant and fearless!"</p>

  <p>Matteo laughed. "If he has too many life vitality jades, he could give them to others. Why does he choose to spend so many life vitality jades doing such a silly thing?"</p>

  <p>But the fact was that Zheng didn't have a lot of life vitality jades. All the life vitality jades that he had— all one hundred of them— had been returned to him by the armored warriors of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. And now, he had gone and exchanged all the life vitality jades he had for a chance. His goal, however, was very simple. He only wanted to get the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng laughed at Matteo's words. He did not have the time to retort to Matteo and merely turned and walked towards the center of the dome.</p>

  <p>Matteo's strength and talent weren't worth a mention for Zheng. Matteo's brother, Rhydian, on the other hand, could be considered as a strong opponent to Zheng. It was difficult for Rhydian to ascend to the top of the dome, as it would be for Zheng to touch the dot of blue light.</p>

  <p>Once he had mentally prepared himself, Zheng took a deep breath. The chaotic energy in his body circulated gently and as a result, his body quietly left the ground.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng rose, a force pressed down on his body.</p>

  <p>'The gravitational force is so strong, ' Zheng thought, squinting.</p>

  <p>This gravity was similar to that in the mineral tree of the Divine Kingdom Continent, but wasn't as overbearing. There was no way to resist the gravity in the mineral tree, as warriors would be pulled down once they left the leaf.</p>

  <p>The gravity Zheng was facing right now didn't cause any problems for him.</p>

  <p>He didn't rush but instead, ascended at a slow pace.</p>

  <p>The gravity on his body grew more intense with every foot that he rose.</p>

  <p>It was as if there was a giant hand at the center of the dome holding onto Zheng tightly, forcefully pulling him downwards.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Zheng still maintained a constant speed before calmly increasing it. Apart from the slow increase in speed, no one could notice that a gravitational force was being exerted on Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He's doing so well, this guy! It doesn't look like he's pretending!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Looks like it's not going to be that difficult for him to obtain a second-rank divine weapon."</p>

  <p>"He's only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm but I feel that he will soon be able to join the Swallow Cloud House!"</p>

  <p>These warriors didn't know Zheng one bit. When they had noticed that Zheng was only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm, they had more or less underestimated him. But now that they were watching him ascend so easily, they had begun to admire him.</p>

  <p>Rhydian, however, snorted. "Humph. He's only pretending to be calm. I think he's only barely holding on. I've seen too many of his kind!"</p>

  <p>"You're right. This guy should be able to obtain a third-rank divine weapon at most!" Matteo remarked.</p>

  <p>When the warriors around them heard this, some of them whispered, "He is stronger than you. He can get a third-rank divine weapon pretty easily."</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder, however, continued to look upon Zheng with an amiable gaze laced with a tinge of surprise.</p>

  <p>He had guarded the Weapon House for so many years and had seen many warriors try to obtain divine weapons. There were many peerless talents among them who had had great confidence in themselves. But the white-eyebrowed elder had always felt the fluctuations in their state of mind.</p>

  <p>Even though Rhydian had also slowly ascended, he still needed to make use of a portion of his strength to resist the gravity. Because of this, he hadn't risen at a constant speed. He moved in jerks, sometimes fast, sometimes slow.</p>

  <p>This was very similar to a person pushing a car, with strength being rhythmically released bit by bit.</p>

  <p>There was, however, an exception. If the car was very light, the person pushing the car could deal with it pretty easily, allowing the car to maintain a constant speed. But when a person pushed a heavy car, he could maintain a constant speed only if he had immense strength.</p>

  <p>It was similar to how Zheng was moving upward. His speed was even, not too fast, not too slow. He wasn't going to slow down even a little. This meant that Zheng's strength was more than enough to deal with the gravity and suppress it.</p>

  <p>'This guy has maintained a uniform speed right from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>He's probably trying to show off his strength. But does he have enough of it? And how high can he reach with such a uniform speed?' the white-eyebrowed elder thought to himself.</p>
