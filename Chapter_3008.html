  <p>
</p>

  <p>The voice of the leader of the Sword Legend Palace echoed through the air.</p>

  <p>"Let alone the Burial Sword Palace and the Demon Sword Palace, even in our Sword Legend Palace, more than ten disciples can pull that off!"</p>

  <p>The leader of the Demon Sword Palace laughed and said, "It's normal for Ingram to be excited. After all, the Sword Dance Palace is a place where a bunch of useless craps gather. When there suddenly appeared a disciple who looked somewhat better than the others, he began gloating..."</p>

  <p>The other leaders of the cultivation palaces all agreed with her and smiled.</p>

  <p>However, Ingram just ignored their remarks and kept his gaze fixated on Luo Zheng. He rubbed his chin as he watched him from afar with curious eyes.</p>

  <p>Ingram believed Luo Zheng's potential was far more than what he showed. He was convinced Luo Zheng was a lot stronger than he was letting on.</p>

  <p>The sword-shaped patterns on the surface of the Lofty Sword gradually got bigger and bigger, and they continued to rise higher and higher.</p>

  <p>If a disciple encountered difficulties during their practice with the Lofty Sword and was stuck at a certain point, the sword would assist them by showing the corresponding Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Under the influence of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the disciples would feel enlightened from its support. This would aid them in overcoming their problems.</p>

  <p>Due to this, the speed of cultivation of the disciples from the Sword Light Palace was faster than that of the True Gods outside who cultivated by themselves.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to put in efforts as he recited in a low voice, his eyes shining with determination.</p>

  <p>Normally during recitation, the further a person went, their speed of understanding would slow down and they would lose their momentum. But Luo Zheng was on a whole different level. If anything, his speed kept increasing!</p>

  <p>In fact, someone as talented as him didn't even feel the need of taking the Lofty Sword's support if he were to recite less than two thousand words.</p>

  <p>Under the baptism of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent from the Lofty Sword, Luo Zheng seemed to become stronger!</p>

  <p>Six hundred words...</p>

  <p>Eight hundred words...</p>

  <p>One thousand words...</p>

  <p>The eyes of the palace leaders were now glued to Luo Zheng. What Luo Zheng had achieved currently could be considered a small feat.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes, Luo Zheng had done the impossible task of reciting more than one thousand words. His talent was at a high level.</p>

  <p>"He has recited over a thousand words in five minutes. I suppose it might be something extraordinary in the Sword Legend Palace, but it's normal in our Burial Sword Palace," said Dalton, looking uneasy. He pretended to shrug it off.</p>

  <p>Ingram continued to observe without uttering a word. If Luo Zheng was only capable of this level, then he wasn't worth his attention. But he had a hunch that Luo Zheng's first attempt at this wouldn't stop here.</p>

  <p>"His speed of reciting seems to be getting faster," the leader of the Broken Sword Palace said while leaning forward, now engrossed.</p>

  <p>The other leaders had noticed it as well. They watched in utter disbelief as Luo Zheng continued to surpass their expectations of him.</p>

  <p>In normal instances when warriors went through their cultivation of the Truth of Divine Dao, most of them would recite at a quick pace at the beginning and their speed would gradually decline as time passed.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was different. Instead of his speed lowering every second, it only became faster than the last one.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Zheng three minutes to recite the second 500 words. And it took him another minute to finish reciting the third 500 words. Difficult as the recitation of the Truth of Divine Dao was, he made it look like child's play.</p>

  <p>It was like he knew every word by heart.</p>

  <p>His voice was low and the place was noisy, but the leaders could still make out every word he said.</p>

  <p>"Follow the command, use the bone and blood to..." Luo Zheng's lips moved continuously, without a single pause. Each word was spoken clearly.</p>

  <p>One thousand and five hundred words...</p>

  <p>One thousand and seven hundred words...</p>

  <p>One thousand and nine hundred words...</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng had managed to attract the officiant's attention as well.</p>

  <p>He peered over at the illusion and said, "For the warriors who could recite two thousand words in the first practice, their talent could be considered to have reached the third grade."</p>

  <p>The expression on Dalton's face became serious. His forehead wrinkled as he spoke in a serious tone, "Warriors with third-grade talent cannot compare to Elgin of our Burial Sword Palace, but they are still rare. I didn't expect there would be such a talent in a barren province like Gracious Province."</p>

  <p>"It's too early to say that," Ingram finally spoke. "I have said that his talent is not inferior to mine!"</p>

  <p>Dalton was still not convinced. He scoffed, "Don't get your hopes up. We have all cultivated the Truth of Divine Dao. Don't forget that Elgin recited 4300 words back then!"</p>

  <p>"Just wait and watch. We'll see who's right in the end," Ingram said confidently.</p>

  <p>The light in Luo Zheng's eyes shone brighter and brighter. It was like his eyes were ablaze.</p>

  <p>He felt his voice echo with the Lofty Sword. Whenever he recited a sentence, the Lofty Sword would respond to him.</p>

  <p>The response from the Lofty Sword was not sound or words, but it was the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>'Why does my speed of understanding the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent far exceeds that of the Truth of Cultivation Nature? Is it because I am extremely suitable for cultivating Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, or is it because of the Lofty Sword assisting me?' Luo Zheng debated with himself as he tried to make sense of the situation. He could not believe how fast he was going himself.</p>

  <p>When he reached three thousand words, he suddenly stopped with a confused expression on his face...</p>

  <p>The leaders were all on the edge of their seats. The moment Dalton saw this, he let out a sigh of relief. He looked at Ingram with a smile. "It seems that there won't be any talent on a par with you in the Sword Dance Palace!"</p>

  <p>Ingram and Laura glanced at Luo Zheng, looking equally confused. A while ago, he was reciting words at an alarming speed, but now he stopped. This made them feel strange.</p>

  <p>If he was struggling with words at some part of the Truth of Divine Dao, he would have collapsed by now. His soul would not be able to endure the burden. But, instead of looking miserable, he looked normal. Ingram and the others tried to make out what happened to him. What could have caused him to stop after doing so well?</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng just paused for nine seconds...</p>

  <p>He could not find the answers to his questions that were clouding his mind.</p>

  <p>They clogged his ability to think straight. Luo Zheng sighed and decided to let it go for the time being. Soon after, he began reciting the words again.</p>

  <p>However, this time his speed became inhumanly fast. Slowly, he began to enter the state of forgetting himself. It was like he was possessed. His low tone became high-pitched as he screamed out the words, and his voice pierced through long distances, reaching people far and wide.</p>

  <p>This alerted the other disciples of the cultivation palaces who were in the process of cultivation.</p>

  <p>Kenelm had only recited dozens of words with the support of the Lofty Sword. He had already reached his limits, and he wasn't able to endure anymore. The cultivation was beginning to weigh down on his soul; it was making him light-headed. Every time he recited a word, he felt like his soul was being impaled by a thousand arrows.</p>

  <p>When his body was exhausted from the exertion, Kenelm decided to take a short break before falling to his knees. As he collected himself, he heard Luo Zheng's voice. Instinctively, he looked over at the direction it was coming from.</p>

  <p>Knowing how talented Luo Zheng was, Kenelm assumed he might have recited two or three hundred words at best. He looked along the cyan thread that was connected to Luo Zheng's forehead. Kenelm squinted his eyes to see Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern on the Lofty Sword. He could not believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>His body trembled at the sight of it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern... is now as high as half a person?" A look of disbelief painted Kenelm's face.</p>

  <p>Although he always knew Luo Zheng was a genius, he never expected him to be so gifted. Luo Zheng had already surpassed most of the disciples of the cultivation palaces in his first attempt.</p>

  <p>Kenelm was not the only one who was watching Luo Zheng in utter amazement.</p>

  <p>Faegon, Jago and the other disciples from noble clans witnessed his incredible talent from afar.</p>

  <p>Before this, Faegon was content with his achievements. He even thought he was better than the other disciples due to having more experience of being a disciple of the palace. At least he was able to recite over three hundred words, and his sword-shaped pattern was the size of a palm.</p>

  <p>But his sense of superiority over the others had only lasted for a quick quarter. Now Luo Zheng had left him far behind in terms of learning this Truth of Divine Dao as he kept progressing further.</p>

  <p>'This guy... He really shouldn't belong to the Sword Dance Palace...' Faegan sighed in his heart as he felt defeated.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern continued to grow bigger and higher. Its size attracted the attention of the disciples from other palaces.</p>

  <p>These disciples were all full of themselves and thought they had the best talent. How could they tolerate Luo Zheng's pattern growing so rapidly compared to their own? They began to take offense at Luo Zheng's formidable strength.</p>

  <p>Several disciples from the Demon Sword Palace and the Burial Sword Palace took an unusual move. As they began reciting collectively, their sword-shaped patterns on the blade of the Lofty Sword surrounded Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern.</p>
