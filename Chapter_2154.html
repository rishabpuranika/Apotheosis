<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2154 Brilliant Moon Restaurant </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It would be a month before the test of the Heavenly Han House began.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng decided to stay in the Six-Burden Divine City during this time.</p>

  <p>More and more people flocked to the Six-Burden Divine City and a vast majority of them were proving godly warriors. They were obviously here with the aim of entering the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>There were still a lot forces in the vast space outside the divine cities.</p>

  <p>Some sects were even willing to pay a lot of money to send some of their talented disciples to the Heavenly Han House. They hoped that these talents could cultivate Godly Ways in the Heavenly Han House and then give back to their sects.</p>

  <p>Apart from the various sects, the smaller clans of the thirty-six regions also hoped for their own disciples to enter the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Thanks to all this activity, the Six-Burden Divine City had become very lively.</p>

  <p>The price of using a space tunnel was as high as a hundred divine might coins. But it wasn't a problem for the clans that controlled the divine cities. More and more proving godly warriors came to the Six-Burden Divine City through the space tunnels.</p>

  <p>The downside was that when there were too many proving godly warriors, trouble would erupt.</p>

  <p>It was a Thousand Commandments Slate that had recorded the rules of the Six-Burden Divine City. There was a huge difference between a Thousand Commandments Slate and a Ruling Slate, but it was naturally much more powerful than a Ten Commandments Slate. The Thousand Commandments Slate could record a thousand rules and covered a much larger area. This was why the punishment was much harsher.</p>

  <p>Some of the rules of the Six-Burden Divine City were slightly different from those of the Mirror City.</p>

  <p>The Six-Burden Divine City had banned fighting in the city, but there were still some additional rules. For example, one could issue a challenge to anyone else in the Six-Burden Divine City, but one would have to pay the price of a divine might coin.</p>

  <p>No matter who won, the divine might coin would be paid to the Six-Burden Divine City. It could be considered as a kind of a fighting tax paid to the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Most proving godly warriors of the divine land were very young. They had started practicing martial arts since they reached the Soul Sea Realm, and it was fairly easy for the divine citizens to reach the Spirit Transformation Realm. These youths were at an age where their blood ran hot. So inevitably, they would trouble for each other when they eventually got together. And they had to pay the fighting tax the moment they began to fight. The Six-Burden Divine City was only too happy to receive more divine might coins.</p>

  <p>So before the test of the Heavenly Han House began, the proving godly warriors of the Six-Burden Divine City occasionally fought with each other, and the fights had become an opportunity to test each other's strength.</p>

  <p>Brilliant Moon Restaurant was the largest restaurant in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>A huge patio was built on the top of the restaurant, supported by six pillars. All customers ate at the outer circle while the center of the patio was reserved for the warriors to fight.</p>

  <p>Those who could enter the Brilliant Moon Restaurant all had some background. After all, spending three to five divine might coins in the restaurant every time was not something that even low-rank True Gods could afford, let alone proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>But it was not a problem for this group of martial artists, who were from wealthy families.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant today.</p>

  <p>When Master Evil mentioned the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, he became extremely excited and recommended Luo Zheng to experience the restaurant for himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had fasted for many years, and had no desire for delicious food.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the divine might coins that Master Evil had left behind weren't too many, which was why he wasn't as interested.</p>

  <p>"It's not good for you to think like that. A universe built by a Holy Being is a secondary world, and all the five cereals and eggs contain impurities.</p>

  <p>But the divine land is different. The food in the divine land is in fact formed by chaotic energy, and it becomes beneficial to people when they swallow it. It is easy for divine citizens to not eat food. But in all these years, I haven't seen anyone who has continued fasting. You will understand when you go to the Brilliant Moon Restaurant," Master Evil said.</p>

  <p>The path to pursue Godly Ways was an extremely long one and filled with boring practices. Without something to support them, it was hard for the millions of True Gods to go through to the end. There was always a justified reason for them to cultivate all the way, be it for the sake of fame, benefits, sex, or desire. It was just like Master Evil had said: there was no need to worry about maintaining the purity of their bodies. There were really not many True Gods in the divine land that had really given up on eating.</p>

  <p>After a long time in which Master Evil kept nagging at him, Zheng's interest was piqued. Whatever the case, the divine might coins he had were from Master Evil. So he decided to go to the Brilliant Moon Restaurant.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped into the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, a girl in green clothes walked over to greet him. She was a divine citizen. She glanced at Luo Zheng and when she saw that he was wearing a plain long robe, it was obvious she was looking down on him. She tried to hide her contempt as she asked, "Sir, have you been invited here by friends?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and replied, "No, I've come here alone."</p>

  <p>"This way, please," The girl nodded and led Luo Zheng to a seat on the first floor.</p>

  <p>The Brilliant Moon Restaurant had six floors. Each floor was spacious, but the seats on the first floor weren't as good as those on the other floors.</p>

  <p>The most important purpose for people to come here, other than to taste delicious food, was to watch the fights between the proving godly warriors. This was why there was a reserved patio in the center. But since there was no enchanted barrier laid out around the patio, the first floor was easily affected by the fight of the martial artists.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know this and took his seat rather happily. Master Evil, on the other hand, couldn't wait to introduce the dishes to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The Snow Lotus Arch here is famous, and the chill that it contains can seep into the cinnabar field, nourishing the inner world.</p>

  <p>There's also the Fire Duck Stand. It's one of the specialties of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant.".</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could make himself comfortable, Master Evil had already reeled out a list of the dishes in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Are these dishes expensive?" Luo Zheng asked hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"And the Moon Melting Wine... Expensive? Of course they are expensive. The cost of the dishes in this restaurant is sky-high. I could eat away a house with a single meal. Back then, I- Alas!" Master Evil stopped suddenly, his voice sounding depressed.</p>

  <p>When he had been locked up in the dungeon, Wayne, who was also locked up there, talked constantly about various delicacies in the divine land. Master Evil had never heard of many of the dishes that Wayne had mentioned, and every single one was too tempting to him. There was even a time when Master Evil hadn't been able to stand it any longer and had cursed Wayne. But Wayne had talked about the food non-stop, and even Estelle on the second floor could not stand it any longer. It was at her warning that Wayne had finally shut up.</p>

  <p>It hadn't been easy for him to escape the dungeon. At the moment, he only had his soul fragment left, and couldn't enjoy such delicious food.</p>

  <p>The girl serving Luo Zheng frowned as she saw that he was sitting there in a daze and wasn't ordering anything. Her eyes narrowed contemptuously.</p>

  <p>There were always poor guys who entered the Six-Burden Divine City in order to take the test and become a member of Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>They went to the Brilliant Moon Restaurant but had no money to order the dishes. They just wanted to grab a seat to watch the fight between the proving godly warriors. This kind of people were truly annoying.</p>

  <p>"Sir, if you don't order anything, you can sit over there," the girl said snappily as she pointed to the other side of the patio.</p>

  <p>Rows of chairs stood in an orderly manner and quite a few people were already sitting on the chairs. As he took in the clothing of the martial artists, Luo Zheng knew that most of them were from poor families and could not afford the food in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant. They felt fortunate to find a chair to sit on for free so they could get a glimpse of the strength of this year's proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly. This was when he noticed the disdain in the lady's eyes. He was not angry. Instead, he only smiled as he ordered the dishes Master Evil had told him about.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng reeled off the names of the dishes, the astonishment in the young lady's eyes became more and more obvious.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the dishes that Luo Zheng had ordered were the best in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant. They weren't the most expensive, but they were definitely ones that one could not miss if they went there.</p>

  <p>Some proving godly warriors, with the support of their families, could spend extravagantly in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant. But they did not understand the essence of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant. What Luo Zheng had ordered were the classiest dishes of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, which was why the girl was so surprised.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had ordered the food, the girl's expression shifted.</p>

  <p>He had ordered more than ten delicacies in one go, which meant that he would later have to pay about two hundred divine might coins for the bill. As she looked Luo Zheng up and down and at the kind of clothes he was wearing, the girl was worried that he would not be able to pay the bill.</p>

  <p>However, she was not afraid. The Brilliant Moon Restaurant was run by the Han Clan and no one dared dine and dash here. If he really couldn't pay the bill, it was not her who would suffer in any way.</p>

  <p>As the girl left, Luo Zheng suddenly felt an imposing Mu Ning in the air. Someone from the third floor jumped down and stood in the middle of the patio.</p>

  <p>He cupped his hands and said, "I am Holt Qian from the Qian Clan of the Mirror City!" He then raised a divine might coin and flicked it into the air.</p>

  <p>With a swish, the divine might coin rose into the air.</p>

  <p>And as if a mysterious power had seized it, it suddenly stopped in its tracks.</p>

  <p>Holt Qian raised his head and shouted towards the fourth floor, "I want to challenge Steve Sun! Do you dare accept my challenge?"</p>
