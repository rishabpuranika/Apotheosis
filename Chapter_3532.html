<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3532 Invitation </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore, a giant golden-winged bird soared graciously in the air, spreading out the aura of ferocity.</p>

  <p>Such golden-winged birds named Garudas might as well be considered the number one predator of the food chain in this stage. Most creatures on the Other Shore and Souls of Light would flinch and dodge every time they came across one.</p>

  <p>The Garuda hovered over a cliff that had a sunken path.</p>

  <p>Though the path had existed for quite some time, no one knew how or when it was made.</p>

  <p>At the end of the path was a Soul of Light, who had a pair of wings spread out behind the back. They resembled the wings of the demon women in the Divine Lair, except they were larger and more powerful. It was Phoenix - head of the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>"Before these two had set foot into the Desire World, I had asked help from the Star Falcon race. I wanted them to use all their resources and facilities to kill them," she began explaining.</p>

  <p>"However, we failed and the Dark Bear race was wiped out."</p>

  <p>Previously, she had been too impatient in dealing with Luo Zheng in the Chaotic Source World, which had led to much downfall.</p>

  <p>After that experience, she knew not to act so rashly again. She had to remain calm in order to win.</p>

  <p>But her calmness did not mean surrendering. She had a plan, and she was going to push through with it no matter what.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had shown a great amount of strength the moment he entered the Desire World. He was sure to pose a great threat to her race and their allies.</p>

  <p>"Humph! We should not have relied on the Jin Wu in the first place!" the person beside Phoenix spewed out. This person was one of the Five-element Emissaries of the Bearing race, the Earth Emissary.</p>

  <p>Phoenix's face darkened at the sound of this. "How can you blame the Jin Wu for this? The two humans are too powerful. One of them is a purified being!"</p>

  <p>The Earth Emissary gasped, "A purified being? How did this purified being even set foot into the Desire World? You might be dreaming." There was no way the Earth Emissary was going to buy it.</p>

  <p>When the word spread about Feng Ge, they had already speculated that she was a purified being from the very beginning. She was the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but she suddenly reappeared on the Other Shore with a clear appearance. Her being a purified being was the only reasonable explanation for this to happen.</p>

  <p>But her presence in the Desire World had confused everyone, including Phoenix.</p>

  <p>It was of common knowledge that purified beings could not roam around all stages, because they were rulers of particular stages. If she had managed to enter the Desire World, that would only be possible if she wasn't a purified being. This drove everyone to wonder and debate over her true identity.</p>

  <p>"This is not important," Phoenix snapped. "What's important is their strength. I should ask the Star Falcon race to act soon."</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race resided in the Sky Water City, and proved to be the strongest race in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>"And what if the Star Falcon race fails again?" The Earth Emissary challenged Phoenix. He did not trust anyone at this point.</p>

  <p>"Then..." Phoenix's eyes narrowed. "Then I am afraid no one in Stage Fourteen would be able to defeat them. All we can do is wait for them to move up to the next stages."</p>

  <p>"Allowing them to reach higher stages would only make them stronger along the way. You and I probably wouldn't even stand a chance against them!" he shook his head in frustration. "Phoenix, I have no choice but to report to our emperor. He will report to the Blood Assembly and have the Dark Region deal with them once and for all."</p>

  <p>"The creatures of the Dark Region can only act in the darkness. How do you suppose we lure them into the darkness when they know for a fact, that it is dangerous there?" Phoenix asked.</p>

  <p>"Hey, don't worry about that," the emissary chuckled. "I have a plan."</p>

  <p>"And your plan is...?" Phoenix asked, doubting the emissary a little bit.</p>

  <p>"All you have to do is ask the Star Falcon race to act as planned. If they kill the two humans, then good for us. But if they fail, you'll be the first one to know my plan." he replied with a smug look on his face.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the inner yard of the city lord's mansion, a black Body-strengthening Jade was being held safely in Luo Zheng's hands. This particular stone could increase one's body strength in a similar way that the soul crystal could improve the Souls of Light. After entering the Other Shore, all the Wild Gods needed such jades to strengthen their bodies.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack... "</p>

  <p>With only a slight push, Luo Zheng put enough pressure on the stone for it to turn into fine black powder. He gently sent it into his elixir field.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, the substance made its way through the elixir field to Luo Zheng's meridians. Less than a minute had passed and it was already distributed evenly across his body.</p>

  <p>Almost instantly, Luo Zheng felt his body grow stronger a bit.</p>

  <p>If the Other Shore Power had been destroyed or removed, all the creatures in the Source World would lose much strength. Luo Zheng was not an exception to this. His physical strength had been less than a divine megaton at one point.</p>

  <p>Even after fusing with the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline, his strength did not improve significantly.</p>

  <p>Though he was considered to be a big threat to everyone else, his physical strength was still very poor as compared to his Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>"Master Green Jade, you said before that I would be unable to refine the Body-strengthening Jade," Luo Zheng said to the Green Jade Spirit in his body,</p>

  <p>"but I just devoured it and everything seems fine."</p>

  <p>Prior to entering the Desire World, Luo Zheng had never actually seen a Body-strengthening Jade.</p>

  <p>His first ever encounter with it was in the iron house inside the energy vertex.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Green Jade Spirit had predicted that Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to refine the Body-strengthening Jade, because his body was not cultivated with the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. He proved it wrong by refining the jade quite smoothly into his body.</p>

  <p>"It's a little weird." The Green Jade Spirit thought for a moment and continued, "I guess this means that the Truth of Divine Dao of your body has a connection with the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been able to refine it at all."</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit couldn't seem to understand it either, but it was probably because the Truths of Divine Dao were hard to understand. Other creatures in the chaos wouldn't understand them clearly either.</p>

  <p>There were many features of the Truths of Divine Dao. Some of them repelled one another and some had commonalities. At the time Luo Zheng went against the Evil God, he was able to pour the Truth of Three-Energy Construction into the Imperial Sword Seal. This was because this Truth of Divine Dao had something in common with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt great and happy that his strength had been improved. He didn't plan to stop after refining that first Body-strengthening Jade.</p>

  <p>Breaking Luo Zheng's solitude, Feng Ge stepped in and spread out her arms, smiling at him. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>She wore an ocean blue dress that had light green lace detailing at the hem.</p>

  <p>Her dress was exquisite, beautiful, and at the same time, emitted a tiny bit of energy.</p>

  <p>"You look extraordinary. Was it made by the Guide Weasel race?" Luo Zheng asked, appreciating the beauty in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I didn't expect them to be so good with their hands," she said giddily.</p>

  <p>The dress was not only powerful, but it put her in a great mood.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement. Just then, he picked up another piece of Body-strengthening Jade and handed it to her. "You're here just in time," he said.</p>

  <p>"Try and see if you can refine this jade."</p>

  <p>As a purified being, Feng Ge was physically and mentally strong. However, she still had things to learn, like how to use her power wisely.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't doubt that she could refine the jade. It seemed that the Other Shore creatures were able to do it, so it should be nothing to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>She blinked a couple times and then took the cool-to-touch jade in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Okay," she said and then turned around and took a seat right next to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the stone in her hand shone a brilliant light. "I forgot to tell you something," she said, looking at Luo Zheng intently.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I invited Yudie and Xi Youqin to live in my Phoenix Palace for a while," she replied, trying not to look him in the eye.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned upon hearing this.</p>
