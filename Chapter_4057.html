<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey all had a clear goal: to dominate the entirety of Night View Island as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Thus, they decided to pour their combined efforts onto realizing this goal, so much so that they even lost interest in trying to track Zheng's whereabouts.</p>

  <p>With this goal realized, the Eye Spirit could enter the Ghost Mountain directly when he came here.</p>

  <p>This would make for great credit.</p>

  <p>If they used the credit they would gain from this, they could apply to the Eye Spirit to take back the control of the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Holy Wings Armor was controlled by Slade, which assured the peace of the Element Spirit race inside it.</p>

  <p>All factions had their own positions but the minority was always subordinate to the majority. Once all opinions were organized and consolidated, everyone was found to have sided with Slade.</p>

  <p>It was through this that everyone managed to live peacefully for many years.</p>

  <p>Factional disputes erupted every now and then within the Holy Wings Armor, the matter with Gavyn as quite the most significant example.</p>

  <p>It was forbidden for him to take the Holy Wings Armor away but, through Claire's support, Gavyn was able to do it, which earned him the ire of the members of the Element Spirit race, the fire spirits in particular.</p>

  <p>Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey were three fire spirits who were the most dissatisfied with Gavyn.</p>

  <p>Normally, these three fire spirits should've already gone back since they found nobody in the cave and confirmed that the passageway had already been repaired. Anything else outside of their immediate tasks should've been ignored.</p>

  <p>However, in order to obtain the Holy Wings Armor, they had to make a great contribution that would qualify them to make a request to the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Once they gained control of the Red Demon race, they would quickly make their way towards the Grand Mighty race's territory on the southern tip of the Night View Island. So long as they were able to destroy one race and control the other two, then their mission would be complete.</p>

  <p>None of them expected Zheng and the others to pop out of nowhere and get involved in the battle.</p>

  <p>"Dave! Kill them!"</p>

  <p>Tate ordered.</p>

  <p>To him, so long as he had the Holy Stones then he could control everything.</p>

  <p>Tate felt no fear against those Glede Demons, so what more these mere humans?</p>

  <p>The humans in the Ghost Mountain might be very powerful but there was no way they'd be on these people's side since they rarely left the mountain.</p>

  <p>Dave quickly nodded in obeisance. "Yes, patriarch!"</p>

  <p>As a strong Red Demon, Dave was easily one of Tate's most capable generals.</p>

  <p>He quickly led ten other Red Demons and let out a mighty, thunderous roar!</p>

  <p>As they let out their battle cry, their bodies glowed as every square inch was completely covered by the turtles.</p>

  <p>Armed and boosted, the Red Demons were ready for battle and quickly rushed towards the mountainside.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>Like boulders that came careening down onto the side of a mountain, these Red Demons made the earth tremble as they ran.</p>

  <p>The sight was incredibly terrifying. Huge, hulking creatures with thick skin made long, fast strides as they made their way to battle. Their sharp claws were their most formidable weapons and were able to shatter everything in their wake.</p>

  <p>Bacchus sported a complicated look on his face as he led the Glede Demons towards the top of the birdcage.</p>

  <p>They too did not know where Zheng and his group had come from.</p>

  <p>However, the enemy of their enemy was a friend and the best thing to do now was forge an alliance with these newcomers.</p>

  <p>He knew that once Tate killed these humans, he'd definitely be next.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, as much as the Glede Demons were determined to fight, the white light upon their opponents' bodies was too strong.</p>

  <p>If they rushed towards them, they would only be killed instantly.</p>

  <p>'Damn it!' Bacchus cursed inwardly.</p>

  <p>It felt like a sick joke that these powerful Treacherous Beings proved to be so weak in front of mere white light.</p>

  <p>While Bacchus tried to think of a way for them to fight, the Red Demons had already reached Zheng!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, King Ieuan, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters stretched out their palms.</p>

  <p>On their palms were Holy Stones, bright and bursting with power.</p>

  <p>These Holy Stones did not contain much Light of Annihilation but could still easily kill hostility-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a slight, buzzing sound, streaks of light shot forth from the Holy Stones and struck the oncoming Red Demons.</p>

  <p>Before all these, Dave had thought that they had already won.</p>

  <p>There was no way these humans, who hadn't absorbed Treacherous Beings, could engage in combat against them.</p>

  <p>However, just as he and his men got close enough, these humans suddenly raised their hands and defied all his expectations!</p>

  <p>What in the world was that white light?</p>

  <p>Was it actually the Light of Annihilation?</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, the sight shook Dave to the bone.</p>

  <p>Just as he realized that something was wrong, the bright Light of Annihilation hit him square on the chest.</p>

  <p>In an instant, his turtle collapsed.</p>

  <p>The loss of the turtle immediately reduced his speed and power.</p>

  <p>Treacherous Beings were indispensable to the creatures on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>At that moment, without the turtles' protection, Dave and his men became sitting ducks.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he found the end of a spear pointed right in the middle of his forehead.</p>

  <p>It was a spear Zheng borrowed from Campbell.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>All Dave felt was a sharp sting before a sharp, splitting pain flooded his senses and he lost consciousness.</p>

  <p>His head, simply put, had exploded by the force Zheng exerted onto the spear.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It wasn't over. Having disposed of him, Zheng quickly turned around and turned his weapon towards his other opponents. In a flash, another Red Demon's head also exploded.</p>

  <p>Campbell's spear was a good match for the Light of Annihilation. If Zheng chose to infuse it with the light then it would shine a bright, blinding silver.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't see the need to do that and found it unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Holy Stones were previously unheard of on the Night View Island so the creatures naturally did not know yet how to guard themselves against the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Once the Treacherous Beings had been absorbed by the creatures, their original bodies were insulated by the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>This was the best course of action when there was no Light of Annihilation on the island.</p>

  <p>It was a known fact that the Red Demon race and the Glede Demon race were both very powerful.</p>

  <p>The Wooden Leaf race could never hope to compare. The thorny Treacherous Beings they absorbed were weak and were actually the root cause of their mediocrity.</p>

  <p>However, despite their power, both the Red Demon race and the Glede Demon race were unable to withstand a single blow from the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Zheng navigated fluidly around the Red Demons, almost as if he was a ghost.</p>

  <p>The spear in his hand was a deadly harbinger of death that quickly ended the life of each Red Demon within the vicinity.</p>

  <p>It was jarring for the Red Demons that this young man was able to power through the Treacherous Beings they had absorbed and even make their heads explode with a single spear. In their stupefied state, they found themselves unable to do anything against such a formidable opponent.</p>

  <p>A few Red Demons turned their tail and ran but it was in vain since Zheng caught up to them eventually.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>A massacre. Dave had led his men into a massacre.</p>

  <p>"This, this..."</p>

  <p>"They also have the Light of Annihilation!"</p>

  <p>"How in the world can we fight against them?!"</p>

  <p>Not long ago, the Red Demons had also used the Light of Annihilation to defeat the Glede Demons.</p>

  <p>Never in their lives would they have thought that the weapon they once wielded to victory would someday be used against them.</p>

  <p>It was with this thought that a few Red Demons began to tremble.</p>

  <p>They were the apex predators in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>They were the strongest, the deadliest, and the most formidable.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Treacherous Beings they had absorbed merged with their bodies and gave them strength. Without the Treacherous Beings, it was as if they forgot how to fight entirely.</p>

  <p>Decker, who stood at the back of the crowd, was quite frightened by the spectacle.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng and his group were powerful but not to this extent. He never expected that they'd suddenly take out the Holy Stones and utilize them so as to kill the Red Demons so quickly.</p>

  <p>He was practically speechless!</p>

  <p>Could the creatures outside the Night View Island truly be so powerful?</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Decker. Tate, who also watched the entire scene unfold, could only stare at Zheng in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Only then did he truly realize the gravity of his recklessness.</p>

  <p>He never should've made an enemy out of these humans. Could there still be a chance for him to correct his mistake?</p>

  <p>Those flame creatures were willing to cooperate with him. Maybe these humans would too?</p>

  <p>Tate forced a smile on his face and decided to take on the diplomatic route this time around. Those flame creatures came to the Night View Island to collect Arcana and he did not doubt that these humans came here for the exact same purpose.</p>

  <p>"It's your first time visiting the Night View Island, correct? You must be here for the Ghost Mountain. Our race has actually collected quite a lot of Arcana. Perhaps we can settle this fight with a promise of cooperation?"</p>

  <p>He did not care who between the fire creatures and these humans would finally obtain the Arcana but it would be best if they fought with each other instead of against them.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng merely ignored him and instead turned to Bacchus. "Hey!</p>

  <p>What do you say we kill these Red Demons together?"</p>
