<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a Life and Death Realm warrior so he knew he could easily deal with these creatures if he really wanted to.</p>

  <p>But the way they were able to disperse the force from his attack with their bodies just shocked him.</p>

  <p>To put it into perspective, the Luo Zheng from the past, who was also a nature creature, would never have survived a single punch from the present Luo Zheng now. However, this creature had managed to resolve Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>Although it seemed hard for him and he might have been severely injured, he was still able to move around smoothly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>They pounced towards Luo Zheng one by one, none of them having practiced any cultivation method but still surviving Zheng's fists.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng purposefully did not increase his strength and these creatures were all sent flying by him. However, they all stood up from the ground and revealed faint smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Do these guys have intelligence? Or did the person who set up this True Path deliberately arrange them this way?"</p>

  <p>The creatures were quick to come at him again, but this time, Luo Zheng did not pull his punches.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>He had activated the forceful energy within his body and launched a series of formidable attacks upon those who came at him. Anybody that got close was immediately smashed into a bloody pulp by his punch.</p>

  <p>The sight of the bodies exploding surprised him, not because of the gore, but because of the color of the blood that burst from the inside. "Golden blood?"</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, only those belonging to the Celestial Position race had golden blood. Luo Zheng, as an outsider who was recognized and became a member, had yet to have his blood changed but the fact remained that golden blood was the signature of the elite race.</p>

  <p>There must be a connection.</p>

  <p>His punches smashed the creatures into a pulpy, golden blood shower that then dispersed and transformed once again into Dark and Light energies. These energies coalesced and reformed into solid, human-shaped creatures that once again charged at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, he noticed that the creatures had grown exponentially faster and stronger!</p>

  <p>"Forceful energy!" he remarked in shock when he felt it emanate from the creatures that were now rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>However, there was another peculiar thing: the way they moved seemed very similar to his own style.</p>

  <p>A sudden realization popped in his head: they were copying him!</p>

  <p id="top_12">Luo Zheng couldn't help but feel angry at this observation, "I'll destroy you all from the inside out!"</p>

  <p>A bit of forceful energy wasn't going to stop Luo Zheng from squashing these nature creatures. Luo Zheng took a deep breath and began to circulate the life vitality in his body, allowing it to surge into higher levels.</p>

  <p>But, the moment he tried increasing his strength, the creatures also seemed to do the same!</p>

  <p>Nature level...</p>

  <p>Illuminating Soul Realm...</p>

  <p>Virtual Tribulation Realm...</p>

  <p>Life and Death Realm!</p>

  <p>The suddenness of this increase in power stunned Luo Zheng and he finally started to feel the pressure catch up to him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Several creatures charged at him simultaneously. There was no room to dodge since the True Path was only enough for one person which forced Luo Zheng to retreat a few steps.</p>

  <p>This was the moment he realized that he shouldn't have wasted his time fighting with these creatures. The goal was to pass the True Path and there were probably still many stages he would have to undergo. There was no point in wasting both his time and strength here.</p>

  <p>Finally having clarified his goal, Luo Zheng activated the power of the dragon scales and used it to shatter his enemies. As they fell, he summoned his forceful energy and gathered his life vitality at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Cloud-chasing Skill!"</p>

  <p>The wind travelling skill he learned from Brianna truly came handy this time. It was good that, despite having only grasped the first layer of the Wind Law, he had already mastered the technique after many hours of practice when he got back in Central Region. Luo Zheng borrowed the power of the winds and used it to glide forward uninhibitedly.</p>

  <p>With the wind under his control, Luo Zheng was able to go through and leave the peculiar creatures behind him.</p>

  <p>However, that was from his perspective.</p>

  <p>Saul, Ning Yudie, and the two other girls both saw something else. Despite Luo Zheng, himself, feeling as if he was getting away, the others only saw him make running postures but did not move an inch at all.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng seemed to have discovered something. He's good for now but the next bit will be difficult," Saul said.</p>

  <p>His life vitality had greatly increased his speed but Luo Zheng soon realized that the creatures, formed by both Dark and Light energies, also became faster as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes suddenly widened in realization, "Life vitality! They're using life vitality."</p>

  <p>They saw him use it and now, they had suddenly also gotten the ability to use life vitality.</p>

  <p>It didn't help that all their cultivation bases had been raised to the first level of the Life and Death Realm, the same as Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>What was worse was that they were all much stronger than ordinary warriors. As nature creatures, they were already able to withstand Zheng's attacks which meant that they were pretty powerful than all races Luo Zheng had encountered.</p>

  <p>He truly felt the pressure pounding in his veins now.</p>

  <p>They were strong but it was fortunate that Luo Zheng realized he didn't have to waste time and energy fighting them. It wasn't worth it. The only thing he needed to do was to sprint forward and get through this path. He'd be okay as long as he maintained the distance between them.</p>

  <p>However, this distance was quickly diminishing. Luo Zheng felt the strong Wind Law behind him. Couple this with a few creatures also using the Space Law to travel through space, and it was only a matter of time before the gap was closed.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The explosion and smell of slightly singed hair told him that the creatures just attempted to launch a formidable pillar of Fire Law towards him.</p>

  <p>Law Powers, they were using Law Powers!</p>

  <p>He had only used the Wind Law earlier but these creatures were now using all kinds of Original Law, trying to get to him.</p>

  <p>"Are they also proficient in all kinds of Original Law?" he couldn't help but wonder to himself.</p>

  <p>"The Sacred Race is the creator of all the Laws," he heard Saul's voice reverberate through the path. "The members of this race can automatically comprehend all the Laws shortly after being born. Once you use a Law Power, then they will use every kind to fight you!"</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Luo Zheng felt his movement slow down.</p>

  <p>The Time Law!</p>

  <p>"The Sacred Race? I've never heard of them!" he exclaimed grumpily.</p>

  <p>The Time Law had made him sluggish so he quickly had to apply it to himself to cancel the effects and help him speed away once again. Had he known this before, Luo Zheng would've given up fighting with them and just used his physical strength, "What kind of race are they?"</p>

  <p>"This race is the origin of all primates. The most perfect race!" the cyan dragon, who had been silent all this time, answered in his head.</p>

  <p>The number of races classified as primates was extremely large: there were monkeys, gorillas, baboons, humans, ogres, the Demon Night race, etc.</p>

  <p>Vicious beasts, legendary beasts, super legendary beasts, and true spirits, after gaining enough wisdom and having enough strength to reach the morphing stage, would usually take on the shape of a human.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon, for example, had morphed into a human named Josh in the past. Formidable creatures like him usually had a human form counterpart.</p>

  <p>But those races actually didn't transform themselves into humans. The cyan dragon's explanation quickly cleared things up for Luo Zheng who now understood that the transformations were not based on humans but on a more powerful race which looked quite similar to humans: the Sacred Race.</p>

  <p>But that was not all. All races, be it human, Demon Night, ogre, or whatever, all inherited some kind of unique characteristic from this primordial Sacred Race that caused them to choose different paths and adopt different systems of cultivation.</p>

  <p>It was the Demon Night who resembled the Sacred Race the most.</p>

  <p>Newly-born Demon Night infants were already nature creatures which was an unrivaled advantage over other races. However, there was a cost to this inborn advantage. The Demon Night race was known to have more females than males which made their reproduction rate extremely low.</p>

  <p>"I understand it now," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>However, another thought crossed his mind: If they were so perfect, then why had he not heard of them before? Why were there no traces of them? Did they all just disappear?</p>

  <p>He was about to ask the cyan dragon for his wisdom but a sudden flurry of attacks rained down upon him by the creatures.</p>

  <p>There was no way he was allowing himself to get hit given his current strength. The only thing Luo Zheng could do was to continue running in the hopes of dodging their attacks. Unfortunately, the creatures coming for him only seemed to increase both in number and power.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Zoom!</p>

  <p>All sorts of Law Power attacks came at him: wind blades, fire swords, thunder strikes…</p>

  <p>Saul shook his head at the sight, "Luo Zheng won't be able to take it much longer."</p>
