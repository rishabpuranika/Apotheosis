  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Small request?"</p>

  <p>The malicious aura emanating from Emperor Charm grew more intense.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings could not be killed, but the creatures that fused with them could.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm slowly raised his arms. Something slowly jutted out from them.</p>

  <p>They were two spikes formed by the Treacherous Being he fused with.</p>

  <p>"I also have a small request: disappear from the Ghost Mountain," Emperor Charm said with a snarl.</p>

  <p>Washburn felt his heart sink with dread. "You have the audacity?"</p>

  <p>If one wanted to stage a battle in the Ghost Mountain, they had to make a request to the Monkey Masters first.</p>

  <p>Anyone who broke such rules and acted without permission here would be punished.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm, if you attack in the Ghost Altar, the Monkey Masters will not let you go!"</p>

  <p>"You will receive the harshest punishment from the Ghost Mountain!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you dare!"</p>

  <p>The other five Great Ghost Priests warned.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm didn't budge.</p>

  <p>His eyes were flashing like two golden suns now.</p>

  <p>The aura of the hatred-level Treacherous Being poured out of him in waves.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven finally stepped forward and placed his hand on Emperor Charm's shoulder. "Stop."</p>

  <p>"Why? Are you scared of them?" Emperor Charm scoffed.</p>

  <p>For many years, the human race always had a say in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests of other races could only comply with their tails tucked between their legs.</p>

  <p>But now that the Element Spirit Civilization was here, they suddenly turned their noses up at humans. Emperor Charm couldn't bear the disrespect.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. But if we act out of turn, we'd just be putting ourselves in trouble," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reminded gently.</p>

  <p>Human heroes held the Primeval Lord of Heaven in high esteem. His words carried weight.</p>

  <p>With his persuasion, Emperor Charm suppressed his anger and stepped aside.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven turned his attention on Washburn.</p>

  <p>Washburn and the Great Ghost Priests of other races actually mattered little to him.</p>

  <p>He appraised the Eye Spirit coolly. "Wonderful of you to bring the wolf teeth to the Night View Island. It seems you know a lot about the Ghost Mountain."</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit remained silent.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven continued, "But as I recall, when the Ghost Master used the Thirteen Teeth Necklace to survive a great disaster, it had been broken."</p>

  <p>"I know that," the Eye Spirit said.</p>

  <p>The wolf teeth were, indeed, covered with mottled cracks, as if they had once been shattered. In fact, the bloodline power inside them had disappeared, leaving only its aura.</p>

  <p>Frankly, they had little to no value like this.</p>

  <p>"But I also know the Ghost Master's obsession is the Thirteen Teeth Necklace. As long as the thirteen wolf teeth are collected and arranged properly, he will naturally wake up," the Eye Spirit said smugly.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven only smiled at this. "You're wrong. The Ghost Master's obsession is not the Thirteen Teeth Necklace itself, but the bloodline power contained within it. The thirteen kinds of bloodline power are comparable to the power of the four origin-level bloodlines. Without the bloodline power, the necklace is insufficient to awaken him."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Eye Spirit was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"That is nonsense. Treacherous Beings can be awakened by their obsessions, which are usually objects."</p>

  <p>Although what the Primeval Lord of Heaven said made sense, obsessions were mysterious and unique to the Treacherous Beings. No one could really tell what they were until they'd tried it.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit simply chose not to believe what the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead and check for yourself then," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest carried that wolf tooth and headed straight for the core area of the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>When he passed by the huge painting of the Ghost Master, he gazed at it for a moment and compared the wolf tooth in his hand with the depiction of the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.</p>

  <p>They looked exactly the same!</p>

  <p>This made him feel very excited.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be hope in awakening the Ghost Master after all. Perhaps he could finally leave the Ghost Mountain and go out into the world!</p>

  <p>He hurried to the end of the passageway.</p>

  <p>At this point, the walls were covered with murals depicting all kinds of monkeys, spanning several thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest knocked gently on the wall.</p>

  <p>There was no response.</p>

  <p>He continued knocking relentlessly.</p>

  <p>After a long time, one of the monkeys in the mural slowly began to take shape and eventually emerged from the wall.</p>

  <p>He was a Monkey Master.</p>

  <p>He was once a follower of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" the Monkey Master snapped. "Did we not say not to disturb us unless it was urgent?"</p>

  <p>In the Ghost Mountain, only the Primeval Lord of Heaven had the privilege to wake up the Monkey Masters at any time and any place.</p>

  <p>This was because it was understood the Primeval Lord of Heaven's work was of vast importance.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Monkey Masters, the other Great Ghost Priests were all worthless in comparison.</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest bowed respectfully to the Monkey Master. "I have come here to show you something that might be important."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" The Monkey Master was getting impatient.</p>

  <p>What possibly could be so important coming from the Night View Island?</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest held out his hands, presenting the wolf tooth respectfully.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Master took one look at the wolf tooth and was startled. He snatched it up immediately.</p>

  <p>He sniffed and gnawed at it with his teeth. He turned it around his fingers for some time, staring at it closely at all angles, before finally pounding against the wall.</p>

  <p>Knock! Knock! Knock!</p>

  <p>"Wake up, all of you!"</p>

  <p>The monkeys in the murals started emerging one after another.</p>

  <p>They were irritated at having been woken so abruptly.</p>

  <p>But when their eyes fell on the wolf tooth, they, too, were shocked awake and started chattering among themselves.</p>

  <p>"A wolf tooth?"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"Are there others?"</p>

  <p>The first Monkey Master turned back to the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest. "Where did this come from?"</p>

  <p>"Some people brought it here," the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest reported. "They come from the world outside the Night View Island."</p>

  <p>"They only have this one?" asked the Monkey Master.</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest thought for a moment. "There could be more. Based on what they've said so far, it seems they are in possession of others."</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit, after all, seemed quite certain the Ghost Master could be awakened.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he handed over the wolf tooth readily, which implied it wasn't his only one.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters on both sides of the passageway started buzzing in excitement.</p>

  <p>"I'll verify if this is real first."</p>

  <p>The first Monkey Master brought the wolf tooth into the huge innermost door.</p>

  <p>Through the crack in the door, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest spotted a huge foot. He surmised it must belong to the Ghost Master.</p>

  <p>The ordinary Great Ghost Priests had never seen the Ghost Master with their own eyes before.</p>

  <p>Among them, only the Primeval Lord of Heaven had.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, the Monkey Master came back, his face looking grave.</p>

  <p>In a trembling voice, he pronounced, "This wolf tooth is the real thing!</p>

  <p>Quickly! Take me to those who brought it!"</p>
