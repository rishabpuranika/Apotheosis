  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Two passages?" From the look on his face, Adrian seemed to be quite surprised.</p>

  <p>Curling his lips, Lincoln said, "If you decide to take the passage on the left, you won't ever be able to step foot into the Dark Underground Palace until the end of time!"</p>

  <p>Originally, when he agreed to Adrian's request, it had been solely because he helped him to gain his freedom. Back then, he wasn't really expecting that Adrian would be insisting on taking the seven Spirit Supreme Realm warriors along with them.</p>

  <p>To be capable of cultivating to such a level, it should go without saying that none of them were fools. Lincoln might have been so relaxed all the time, but he was also quite a brave and cautious man. The seven brothers, on the other hand, were by no means good people. There was a good chance that they'd opt to take all of the treasures the moment he opened the entrance to the underground palace.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, Lincoln had faith in his own abilities. And on top of that, he was even more confident in Zheng's capabilities.</p>

  <p>If they could behave well in the process, things would be good, but were they to do something that troubled him or Luo Zheng, they would just be shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

  <p>The moment the hidden passage was opened, a dark and numbing Mu Ning blew out from deep within. It felt as though a countless number of ghosts had been rushing toward them, with each and every single one of them baring their fangs and swinging their claws, raring to tear everyone to shreds.</p>

  <p>"Such a dense amount of dark energy!" Ab exclaimed in awe.</p>

  <p>"It's a good thing that I brought this with me."</p>

  <p>Adrian, who had been standing on the side, brought out several pale yellow branches. These branches were from the Sun Flame Tree. It was a type of tree with fire attribute, which was rather hard to come by. It only grew at the top of a number of volcanoes. In the event that a volcano would erupt and the tree would get covered by layers of lava, the Sun Flame Tree would not burn, and instead, it would actually even draw in the heat from the lava itself.</p>

  <p>Making use of the branches from the Sun Flame Tree to withstand the dark energy was a great plan. It was something that Lincoln had asked them to prepare beforehand.</p>

  <p>As if Freya was carrying out a feat of magic, two branches of the Sun Flame Tree suddenly manifested in her hands. After handing one over to Luo Zheng, she kept one for herself. Then, with just a wave of Zheng's hand, two balls of fire appeared and ignited the tips of the branches they were holding.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the branches of the Sun Flame Tree were completely dry, the speed at which they had been burned wasn't that fast. In actuality, they simply let out a bit of smoke as dark red light was emitted from the burning area.</p>

  <p>When the branches were lit up, the dark energy suddenly met its archenemy. It was just like ice and snow coming into contact with a big fire as it rapidly melted away.</p>

  <p>"Well, then. Let's go in," Lincoln said, as he held onto a branch of the Sun Flame Tree, showing them the way into the hidden passage.</p>

  <p>The lips of the seven brothers moved slightly, making it seem as though they were communicating through the use of life vitality. Even though Luo Zheng was unable to hear anything, he could tell from just a single glance that they were probably up to no good.</p>

  <p>He and Freya then stepped into the depths of the passage as well, each of them having a branch of Sun Flame Tree in their hands.</p>

  <p>Zheng's lips moved just the slightest bit, and he whispered to Lincoln in secret, "Those guys seem to be plotting something."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to turn tail?" Letting out a soft chuckle, Lincoln couldn't help but poke fun at him.</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me?" Luo Zheng replied flatly. "I just wanted you to know."</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to get anxious. It's gonna be just fine if these guys don't do anything, and I'll keep my promise and give them their shares. And even if they do, then they'll just be digging their own graves," Lincoln replied, sounding so sure of himself. Right after saying that, he asked Luo Zheng, "Isn't that right, Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>From this, it was easy to understand that he intended for Luo Zheng to be on his side.</p>

  <p>"Of course." There was a deadpan look on Zheng's face. Truth be told, he couldn't really care less about the agreement made between Lincoln and those warriors. That being said, if those people acted recklessly, he wouldn't really have any qualms about getting rid of them whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Right now, it wasn't just the people from the Magnolia Sacred Place who had their eyes on them.</p>

  <p>In the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place of the Demon Night, there were also some warriors who had been keeping a watchful eye on them.</p>

  <p>"They have already located the second passage. It looks like they came prepared, or at least, they didn't come barging in." The Saint Lord of the sacred place stood atop the highest leaf. Despite the leaf being just about the size of a palm, it was still able to hold the weight of a warrior.</p>

  <p>"They've just arrived at the second passage. That doesn't really count for anything, given the fact that they still have seven passages ahead of them. What's more, with regards to this matter of the Dark and Light Nine-turn Passage, it wasn't much of a secret anyway. One could easily ask around in the Dark World and learn about it. The only thing we have to do is wait and see whether they really have a way to open the underground palace or not," stated another Demon Night woman, with a smile creeping onto her face.</p>
