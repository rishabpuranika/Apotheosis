  <p>
</p>

  <p>If Riyad knew that Luo Zheng was going to act like a fool, he never would have come here tonight to meet him.</p>

  <p>His purpose for looking for Luo Zheng was very simple. He wanted to put the slave seal on Luo Zheng, making him be a slave under him. If Luo Zheng was unwilling to be enslaved, Riyad would choose to kill him. For those who were useful, Riyad would never kill them carelessly. This was one of the reasons why he could become so powerful in the mine.</p>

  <p>However, to everyone's surprise, Luo Zheng was choosing to ignore this dangerous situation, and was even talking to Riyad like an idiot.</p>

  <p>If Riyad didn't have any scruple about the public right now and made up his mind to kill Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng was sure to be dead by now, in everyone else's eyes at least.</p>

  <p>"I warn you one last time. Get out of the way," Riyad snarled as he stared at Luo Zheng with a cold gaze. It was indeed an extremely shameful thing for him to be fooled by a Life and Death Realm warrior in front of so many people.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't show the slightest signs of fear as he stared back at the man and asked, "Tell me. What is the purpose of becoming powerful?"</p>

  <p>A trace of killing intent flashed across Riyad's eyes and he stretched out his hand to grab onto Zheng's shoulder. Since Luo Zheng did not back away in the face of the attack, Riyad decided to punish him; to hell with the rules and the witnesses.</p>

  <p>His hawk-like hand directly grabbed Zheng's shoulder. The life vitality within his body began to circulate. He seemed to have launched an effortless attack, but in fact, he was using almost 80% of his strength.</p>

  <p>Of course, no one else knew what was happening inside him. To them, it was most likely that Riyad had already used every ounce of his hidden strength. Zheng's bones were probably going to be shattered within about three seconds.</p>

  <p>However, they were astonished to see that Luo Zheng was standing motionless and he repeated his words...</p>

  <p>At that moment, Riyad got mad and unleashed his power. Zheng's shoulder gently swayed and emitted a counter attacking power which was so strong that his enemy couldn't even stand upright.</p>

  <p>Under the attack of Zheng's power, Riyad, shocked by the terrible strength of his opponent, found his entire body starting to retreat rapidly. His feet plowed two grooves into the ground, and after he had been forced back hundreds of feet, his entire body flipped over and his fist smashed itself of its own accord into the ground behind him before he finally came to a stop!</p>

  <p>Riyad had actually released a terrible power by launching this punch. If he hadn't done that, his bones wouldn't have been able to withstand the immense and shattering pressure and would break apart into pieces inch by inch!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>When Riyad's punch landed on the ground behind him, it caused the ground to sink slightly. Then, the surface of the ground started to roll up and formed a one thousand-feet huge crater. Several of the warriors, who were silently cultivating, were sucked into the crater too, and they all started to fly up into the air.</p>

  <p>Some of them, who were extremely focused on their cultivation and had been disturbed, were furious and their faces were filled with anger.</p>

  <p>However, when they saw Riyad, they didn't dare to flare up. They were curious about who had caused him to thrust his fist on the ground.</p>

  <p>As for those who were watching the scene before them, they were all left dumbstruck after witnessing the entire process.</p>

  <p>It was easy for every single one of these warriors to create a one thousand-feet crater in the ground with just one punch.</p>

  <p>The problem was that they had clearly seen that Luo Zheng had not punched anything just now. He had merely moved his shoulder a little bit, but he had managed to release so much power!</p>

  <p>Moreover, after his shoulder had slightly swayed, his power had been transferred to Riyad's body. This was the first layer of the force dispelling technique! Then Riyad had kept on retreating, which was the second layer. And finally, when Riyad could not get rid of the power completely, he had no choice but to push it into the ground. This was the third layer.</p>

  <p>This was to say that Zheng's strength had caused such enormous damage even after being reduced three times...</p>

  <p>He had erupted this powerful force just by moving his shoulder a little.</p>

  <p>How terrifying was Zheng's strength?</p>

  <p>As for Riyad, a look of disbelief surfaced in his eyes. He naturally could not understand why or how Luo Zheng was able to unleash such power, but he began to understand why the three men he had sent out to kill Luo Zheng were instantly sent to hell, and why the three slave seals had disappeared at the same time.</p>

  <p>The man's strength was immeasurable!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was like a ghost as he traveled through space and instantly appeared in front of Riyad.</p>

  <p>The latter no longer looked down on Luo Zheng. He realized that even if he went all out, it wasn't going to be an easy task to defeat Luo Zheng. Therefore, when Luo Zheng moved towards him, the life vitality within Riyad's body started to surge crazily. He vigilantly stared at Luo Zheng, ready to take action at any time to strike him.</p>

  <p>If he were to make a move here, it might lead to quite a bit unnecessary trouble. But right now, nothing was more important than his own life.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng moved and came to a halt in front of Riyad, he just uttered the same words, "Tell me..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Riyad looked very confused and upset. He was indeed afraid of Luo Zheng; even though he looked like a fool, he was still very powerful. Puzzled, he wondered what Zheng's words meant.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he wouldn't be able to leave today if he didn't answer Zheng's question. Therefore, Riyad, usually such a formidable person, finally refrained himself from attacking and began to seriously ponder over Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>"If we become more powerful, we can live longer!" Riyad replied impatiently after a while. In any case, he had already lost his face today, so he didn't care about putting himself in a more awkward situation by answering Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>"And what's the purpose of living longer?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Living longer allows us to become more powerful!" Riyad continued to answer, rolling his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then again, what's the purpose of becoming stronger?" Luo Zheng continued to ask.</p>

  <p>Riyad's mouth opened but he didn't say anything. He just stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was really on the verge of despair and anger, wondering whether Luo Zheng was insane or just psychotic.</p>

  <p>As for the other warriors, they were holding in their breaths to prevent themselves from laughing out loud... They didn't dare laugh anyway. Of course, if some other warrior had answered Zheng's questions like Riyad had done just now, they would surely laugh out loud without scruple.</p>

  <p>Riyad, who was becoming more and more helpless and morose, roared,</p>

  <p>"Becoming stronger is for a better enjoyment. If we become more powerful, we can control the whole world and make use of the wealth of the world. And we can take charge of the life and death of all living creatures!"</p>

  <p>As Riyad roared, Zheng's eyes suddenly lit up and he once again fell into deep thought.</p>

  <p>"Taking charge of everything..." Luo Zheng muttered and his voice trailed off again.</p>

  <p>He truly did feel tired of something, but that didn't mean that Luo Zheng had lost his motivated warrior spirit. He was just tired of killing and the law of the jungle that he had to face everywhere. He wanted a better world.</p>

  <p>"If I can take control of everything, I will definitely change the rules and this universe." The light in Zheng's eyes became brighter and brighter, and they shone like fire!</p>

  <p>"At my current strength, I'm not yet qualified to be tired of anything. I still have many important matters to attend to, tasks to complete and all...</p>

  <p>It's useless to be tired of everything. I can only work hard to become stronger and then change... Yes."</p>

  <p>After ascending to the Upper World, Zheng's state of mind had been affected by something and changed a bit; perhaps this was because he was not used to the new environment, or perhaps he was lonely, which was why he had finally become trapped into this mental predicament.</p>

  <p>However, his ability to recover himself was also extremely strong. He just relied on his instincts to analyze and contemplate and the questions he asked Riyad were just a channel.</p>

  <p>Of course, the answer which he forced Riyad to come up with was not the correct one. Or rather, it was not important.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had managed to contemplate correctly and obtain some amount of comprehension after being enlightened by Riyad's words, or rather, from the train of thoughts they started in his mind.</p>

  <p>To a warrior, suffering such mental predicaments was an extremely dangerous affair. Many warriors, who encountered such dilemmas, weren't able to find the meaning of their own life and they never recovered. Some of them hid in the mountains, some became crazy, and some even killed themselves the moment they figured out the meaning of life...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, quickly walked out of this predicament through contemplation.</p>

  <p>After he had broken free from his confusion, Zheng's goal was even clearer to him now. His warrior spirit had also completed its transformation and had upgraded through this contemplation...</p>

  <p>An expression of grievance almost began to appear on Riyad's face. He thought that it was rather unlucky and idiotic of him to provoke a fool like Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, with a gleam in his bright eyes, Luo Zheng smiled at Riyad and said the most unexpected thing, "Thank you!"</p>

  <p>Riyad frowned. He no longer wanted to talk to Luo Zheng. With a flick of his cape, he dashed towards the other side of the gathering place.</p>

  <p>He believed that Luo Zheng wasn't insane, and was just playing around with him, like a cat with a mouse. He became even more indignant at the thought of this. Just as he had returned to where he lived, he saw two armored warriors standing at his door.</p>

  <p>When Riyad saw these two armored warriors of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, a smile immediately appeared on his face. The reason he had been able to be so overbearing and supercilious in the mine was all because of the support of these two armored warriors.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Huang, Mr. Chen, why are you two here? Are you short of life vitality jades?" Riyad chuckled, and was extremely polite as well.</p>

  <p>After he had taken control of the mines, he had given out a lot of life vitality jades to these two warriors. The trio could be considered quite familiar and frank with each other. The armored warriors would let him do whatever he wanted to, and he would give them life vitality jades in return. This was their deal.</p>

  <p>However, one of the armored warriors just coldly uttered, "Riyad, I don't want your life vitality jades today. But I am warning you not to take any action against Luo Zheng."</p>
