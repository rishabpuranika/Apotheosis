<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the Snake Goddess heard the words of the leader of the Night Being race, she gasped in shock.</p>

  <p>Seeing her reaction, everyone grew curious. What could the leader have said to make her react like this?</p>

  <p>"What did they say?" asked Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess blinked a few times before she spoke, "They said they had a way to help Luo Zheng get rid of the Treacherous Being."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Ying and King Ieuan were taken aback by her response.</p>

  <p>"Even if they could deal with the Treacherous Being, why would they do that?" Pearson asked.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Three Purities Stage had their positions. However, no one knew what the Night Being race was up to. This made Pearson even more cautious with them.</p>

  <p>"He said that Luo Zheng helped them retrieve the six-headed eagles' eggs, so he wanted to repay him," the Snake Goddess explained.</p>

  <p>Pearson shook his head. "They did take the eggs, and the eggs are rare, but this reason just sounds so far-fetched at this point."</p>

  <p>"I agree," King Ieuan echoed with a nod.</p>

  <p>Hearing their discussion, the Snake Goddess remained silent to think it through.</p>

  <p>Their problem was tricky. If they couldn't drive the Treacherous Being out of Luo Zheng's body, it would be meaningless to follow him. However, if they acted rashly, they'd only be faced with deaths.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the Wing King's back grew silent and hesitant.</p>

  <p>"I'll grow bigger and let them join us," suddenly said the Wing King. "We can choose to believe them."</p>

  <p>Pearson frowned. "Why do you believe them?"</p>

  <p>"Because we have no other choice," the Wing King said sternly.</p>

  <p>Compared to the three Eternal Realm Hunters, the ones present knew better Luo Zheng's importance to the group.</p>

  <p>They could lose anyone, except Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You're right," Fuxi agreed.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I'm afraid we have no point of retreat," said King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess smiled lightly at the leader of the Night Being race and said, "I believe you. You can come up."</p>

  <p>As soon as the leader received her message, the Wing King's body flashed with a light and expanded drastically as he transformed into a huge Green Jade eagle.</p>

  <p>Although the Night Being race could catch up with the Wing King's speed, it would still be challenging. When the Wing King slowed down, they took this as an opportunity and jumped upon his back.</p>

  <p>Even though the Wing King invited them, they maintained a certain distance.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and her group stood at the base of the left wing, while the people of the Night Being race stayed on the right.</p>

  <p>"Do you really have a way to kill the Treacherous Being? Squeak!" King Ieuan asked hastily.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Night Being race shook his head in response. "They cannot be killed. Even the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't kill them, what more could we do? But we still have a way to expel the one from Luo Zheng's body so he is freed from possession."</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes widened in excitement as they heard this.</p>

  <p>"If you can expel the Treacherous Being, we would be indebted to you," the Snake Goddess said as she cupped her hands towards the leader of the Night Being race. "You also mentioned it was a hostility-level Treacherous Being. Does this mean that Treacherous Beings have different levels?"</p>

  <p>The leader nodded. "Yes, there are different levels. Although the Treacherous Beings are indestructible, their strength is still divided among levels. The levels were determined by the Element Spirit Civilization. The weakest is the hostility level, followed by the resentment level, and topped by the strongest hatred level."</p>

  <p>"Even if the Treacherous Being is powerful, it is at the weakest hostility level," sighed Eastern Emperor Taiyi. "How strong is the strongest hatred level?"</p>

  <p>An expression of defeat washed over Pearson's face. "The Treacherous Being that eliminated the Primal Tiger race should be at the hatred level."</p>

  <p>Although the Eternal Realm Hunters were well-informed, they did not live in the Supreme Pure Realm. This kept them unfamiliar with the levels of the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>However, the leader of the Night Being race shook his head in disapproval.</p>

  <p>"That Treacherous Being is not at the hatred level. It is at the resentment level at most."</p>

  <p>The people who heard this gasped in shock. Likewise, the faces of Pearson, Thurston, and Sawyer also shifted. Pearson asked, "The Treacherous Being at the resentment level is already so powerful. How much stronger could those at the hatred level be?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The levels were determined by the Element Spirit Civilization," the leader responded. "Nobody knows whether a Treacherous Being at the hatred level exists or not. I haven't heard of or seen one before."</p>

  <p>"We need to catch up with Luo Zheng and expel the damn thing," said Ying.</p>

  <p>However, the leader of the Night Being race waved his hand against it. "We are in no rush. If we take action right now, the Treacherous Being will come for us. All Treacherous Beings have strong will. We must attack it when its will weakens."</p>

  <p>What he said was reasonable, which calmed down everyone. They patiently waited to see when Luo Zheng would stop.</p>

  <p>The Freezing Wilderness spread over a large area.</p>

  <p>At this time, every inch of it was covered in pure white snow.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, blood could be seen gushing and spraying in the air as the Treacherous Being killed roaming creatures.</p>

  <p>At around two thousand miles, the coverage of snow diverted into a large area of wilderness.</p>

  <p>No one knew how far the wilderness stretched out. It seemed unending.</p>

  <p>"It seems we have arrived at the end of the Freezing Wilderness," Pearson pointed out.</p>

  <p>"So the Treacherous Being doesn't aim at the Freezing Wilderness? But the wilderness ahead?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi clarified.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible? The wilderness is the same as the plain in the Grand Pure Realm. Once we've entered, there's no going back. We cannot go over this snow line," Pearson said as he pointed towards the line.</p>

  <p>Everyone's expression shifted to worry once again.</p>

  <p>"Will the Treacherous Being manipulate Luo Zheng to go over there?" King Ieuan asked as its thin tail swung restlessly behind it.</p>

  <p>"Who knows?"</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng was only three miles away from the snow line.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>Just then, two Snow Scale Dragons emerged from the snow and rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Under the Treacherous Being's control, Luo Zheng flashed, rushed towards the snow line and stepped into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>The two Snow Scale Dragons tailed Luo Zheng, and they had already opened their big mouths. Seeing that Luo Zheng went beyond the snow line, they suddenly stopped and immediately retreated.</p>

  <p>Although the Snow Scale Dragons were not intelligent, they were not going to cross the line by all means.</p>

  <p>They looked at Luo Zheng with pity. This guy was dead meat.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the Wing King's back sank into defeat once again.</p>

  <p>No one had expected this.</p>

  <p>"Beyond the snow line, one cannot turn back. I didn't expect that the Treacherous Being would take him there," the leader of the Night Being race sighed.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess observed Luo Zheng's receding figure. "It took the Treacherous Being so much effort to open up a path in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. This path can't just be a dead end."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" King Ieuan asked.</p>

  <p>"Follow him in," the Snake Goddess ordered.</p>
