<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Both the Dragon Abyss Palace and Dragon Blaze Hall were institutions run by the Dragon Lineage Humans, which were beyond Luo Zheng's reach.</p>

  <p>Even if he had to join the Dragon Abyss Palace, it was no loss for him, but benefits.</p>

  <p>Now, he only cared to improve his strength. Since he had developed an affinity for other laws, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to study the other obelisks and acquire their knowledge.</p>

  <p>After walking around the forest of obelisks a few times, Luo Luo Zheng chose the obelisk that recorded Fire Law. Without hesitation, he sat under the obelisk and started his meditation.</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the Central Region, the competition for the Dragon Soar Arena reached a critical phase.</p>

  <p>Each sect was arguing that the Dragon Soar Arena rightfully belonged to them, and each sect was trying to depreciate the other sects. They were quoting everything they could to prove that they were the rightful owner of the arena.</p>

  <p>More and more forces joined the debate, including the independent cultivators. These cultivators were not members of any sect. They were master cultivators who developed on their own. However, they had proteges and off-springs to look after, and some wanted to start their sects, which was why they were also fighting for the arena.</p>

  <p>The argument continued between the people coveting the arena. During the heated debate, the sects and independent cultivators learned that the only way to obtain the arena was to show military force. And only the strongest would win.</p>

  <p>Although everyone coveted the arena, they had no idea what they were fighting for. They believed that the arena was a passage to higher places.</p>

  <p>However, it was a road of no return. The only thing the arena could bring them was death. When human cultivators entered, they would be imprisoned by the dragon for a thousand years. Without no escape, the powerful cultivators could only age, decay, and die.</p>

  <p>Moreover, when Luo Luo Zheng was transported to the higher place, the cyan dragon had tampered with the divine texture etched on the arena. After that, even if someone passed through the sixth floor of the arena, the circular pattern would only push them out, not transport them up again.</p>

  <p>If the cultivators had known that, they'd feel stupid about clamoring to claim the arena. It was irrational for all these sects to start wars among themselves for a blocked passage that would only bring death.</p>

  <p>However, just before the situation became out of control, the dispute was settled by the World Commercial Alliance when it stood out and mediated among various forces.</p>

  <p>Although the World Commercial Alliance was not a sect, it had great power and influence in the Central Region. More significantly, it had good relations with all major sects and a neutral stance. The alliance was the only force that could settle disputes and establish peace.</p>

  <p>And the proposal they tabled was simple. They suggested transporting the arena to Oracle City, which was the location of the World Commercial Alliance's headquarters. Then, a Martial Arts Contest would be held for all the sects and independent cultivators.</p>

  <p>However, there were strict restrictions on the participants. All contestants had to be under the preliminary stage of the Internal Elixir Realm as it would be unfair for the young cultivators if the masters were allowed.</p>

  <p>After the contest, the person who won the first place would have the arena. The World Commercial Alliance would reward the second and third places, and the prize would be generous as one could imagine.</p>

  <p>In fact, such contests were held regularly by the World Commercial Alliance. Every ten years, the alliance would organize a grand tournament, inviting all the sects of the Central Region. Although the contests were expensive, it was an important way for the alliance to maintain good relations with all the level-four and level-five sects.</p>

  <p>Through the tournament, the alliance would befriend the young talents of major sects.</p>

  <p>Such liaisons allowed the alliance to do business with various sects.</p>

  <p>Little by little, they had built tremendous influence and strength, surpassing that of all the sects except the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the cultivators didn't find it strange when they heard the alliance's suggestion. After all, there was little difference between this tournament and the old ones.</p>

  <p>After thorough consideration, most sects accepted the proposal and agreed to join.</p>

  <p>And their choice was rational. If they disapproved of the proposal, the ones fighting for the arena would be the master cultivators, instead of young, talented disciples. And if that were the case, the whole Central Region would be in danger of being destroyed. The Dragon Soar Arena was indeed a rare treasure, but no one wanted to acquire it at the price of slaughtering trillions.</p>

  <p>After a discussion, all the major sects including Cloud Hall, Bloodwood Cliff, and Mysterious Luna Hall accepted the offer. The World Commercial Alliance began to prepare for the Central Region Martial Arts Contest at Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Hearing the news, all the young men rubbed their hands in excitement. If they could win the Dragon Soar Arena for their sects, they'd be rewarded with support and resources. Although the first prize was difficult to win, all the top ten winners would be highly rewarded. The World Commercial Alliance wasn't frugal. The prizes they offered were great treasures.</p>

  <p>In the following weeks, the proposal and upcoming contest became the talk of the town. Even some hermits were said to enlist for the tournament, aiming to win a good place in the competition.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng was cultivating in a remote city in the Genuine Dragon World, he knew nothing about the tournament.</p>

  <p>After the baptism by laws, he had strengthened his connections with all the laws, but he didn't randomly choose any law to learn.</p>

  <p>Like Space Law or Thunder Law, most rules were divided into ten levels, and the higher level one learned, the higher the strength in the field he could use. These obelisks, however, recorded only the first level of various rules, the most accessible level.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng chose only the obelisks that documented the Original Laws, such as thunder, fire, earth, and wind. These were the fundamental laws that made up the entire physical world. If a cultivator wanted to achieve great success in martial arts, he had to understand the Original Laws. It was essential for Luo Luo Zheng to understand these basic rules.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Luo Zheng three days to read the obelisks, one after another, thus giving him greater knowledge of the first stages of all the Original Laws.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't try to study the remaining obelisks as they explained extensions of the Original Laws.</p>

  <p>For example, the obelisk next to Luo Luo Zheng emitted strong sword intent and rumbling thunder. It obviously contained a Law Power of thunder and metal. Its application in martial arts was Extreme Thunder Sword Intent, which Tianming was practicing. Presumably one of the Dragon Lineage Human master warriors had once mastered this sword intent, and recorded it here.</p>

  <p>Over the three days, Luo Luo Zheng read nine obelisks, which showed his potential in martial arts. His learning not only impressed Elder Wei but also made Zack jealous.</p>

  <p>After entering the Genuine Dragon World, most cultivators would stay in the forest of obelisks for tens or hundreds of months.</p>

  <p>Not everyone had an affinity with the laws, which meant that many people faced difficulties learning them. For example, cultivators, who used skills that caused thunder damage had to master the laws relating to thunder to improve their skills. But if they had low affinity for thunder, they would comprehend the relating laws very slowly. It would take them forever to study even one obelisk.</p>

  <p>Many cultivators who sat alongside the obelisk had been grappling with the laws for a while.</p>

  <p>And this was why Luo Zheng's learning speed shocked everyone.</p>

  <p>After another three days, he moved toward a new area, led by Elder Wei.</p>

  <p>"The obelisks are the first assessment for the people who have entered. It is important for cultivators to understand the laws of the universe! This understanding is more crucial than the energy store or martial arts skills.</p>

  <p>Only the cultivators who have passed will move to the next training session. The next session will teach you how to improve your soul power," explained Elder Wei with patience. He smiled kindly at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Soul power..." Luo Luo Zheng murmured thoughtfully and nodded.</p>

  <p>He hadn't received any systematic soul strength training yet. There was no such thing in the Eastern Region. Till now, Luo Luo Zheng had forged his soul in the mysterious furnace and learned the skill of Spiritual Thorn to improve his use of soul power. Also, the Dark Devil Phantom essence he assimilated had helped boost his soul strength. But still, there had been no systematic training.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was necessary for him to participate in a targeted training.</p>

  <p>Although his soul power was stronger than most of his peers, Luo Luo Zheng needed to learn the skills to improve it and use it.</p>

  <p>When they finally arrived at their destination, Luo Luo Zheng saw a strange black ball floating in the sky. The black ball was unlike anything Luo Luo Zheng had ever seen. It was about two hundred feet in diameter. On its surface, strings of purple lightning swirled continually. As Luo Luo Zheng studied it, he seemed to see a dark object wriggling inside.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" questioned Luo Luo Zheng as he felt a heavy spiritual pressure being released from the ball.</p>

  <p>Elder Wei answered softly, "It is a prison that contains a dead Owl Beast.</p>

  <p>Its soul is searching for a way to escape. In the years that it has been trapped in the black ball, it has turned into an evil spirit. And not an ordinary one, but a Fighting Soul, a Jasper Fighting Soul."</p>

  <p>"Fighting Soul? Jasper Fighting Soul?" Luo Luo Zheng was puzzled.</p>
