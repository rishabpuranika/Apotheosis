<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under the instruction of the old man in the cotton clothes, the crowd of warriors rapidly moved towards the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>Although it was called the Enchanted Barrier Tower, it didn't look like a tower. It was in fact a massive space that had Law Storm tightly locked within it.</p>

  <p>As the Law Storm continued to rage, it was as if this space was limitless; but, in reality, there was a boundary. In the deepest part of the Enchanted Barrier Tower, there was a mighty power lingering there, left by the fight among several Supreme Lords. Anyone who got sucked into the power would suffer the inevitable consequence, and their bodies would be smashed to smithereens.</p>

  <p>Of course, that would only happen when one reached one hundred thousand miles into the tower's depths. It was impossible for the younger generation of the thirteen palaces to reach such a depth. Hence, they were quite safe still.</p>

  <p>Thousands of martial artists entered the Enchanted Barrier Tower�</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered the Enchanted Barrier Tower, everyone felt a strong Law Power rushing towards them!</p>

  <p>"This Law Power contains many different laws!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head cautiously and looked ahead. The laws in front of him formed a violent storm that covered nearly every corner of the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>Even though they had just entered the tower, everyone already felt a formidable pressure building around them. Many of the martial artists immediately revolved their body-protecting life vitality to protect themselves�</p>

  <p>Only a few of the gathered talents did not use body-protecting life vitality, such as Javier, Layla of the Mist Palace, and the other top talents of the other twelve palaces.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng� He did not use the body-protecting life vitality to protect his body either, not because he did not want to, but the problem was that he did not have life vitality anymore. Although the characteristics of the chaotic energy and life vitality were very similar--and to a certain extent, the chaotic energy could be regarded as an enhanced version of life vitality--the chaotic energy was not distributed evenly like the life vitality when it surged out.</p>

  <p>Or perhaps Luo Zheng just hadn't grasped the method to make it emerge more evenly yet. However, this was not the appropriate place to experiment now.</p>

  <p>The martial artists of the thirteen palaces had been gathered here from many supreme worlds. They would become core members if they chose to stay in any tenth grade sacred places. And right now, each of them wanted to outperform the others. Competition was stiff!</p>

  <p>Seeing that Javier, Layla, and some others had easily adapted themselves to the Law Storm without activating their body-protecting life vitality, the other warriors were soon convinced that they were really extraordinary talents.</p>

  <p>However, when they saw that Luo Zheng, who was a warrior only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm, hadn't used his body-protecting life vitality either, they had disdainful looks in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Just keep bluffing. If he can't hold on for more than one hundred miles, that would be truly shameful!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, there are always people who make a fool out of themselves..."</p>

  <p>This year, the test in the Enchanted Barrier Tower was not a competition of speed. They needed to use their skills and strength to walk through the Law Storm as far as they could. After they entered, some moved fast, some were slow, but they all started to explore deeper into the tower.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the crowd was gathered close together, but gradually, the thousands of martial artists formed a long line, and the whole group soon became scattered.</p>

  <p>The Law Storm continuously roared, and occasionally, a few Fire Laws would coalesce together to form a flame the size of a fist. One of these flames suddenly struck Zheng's body, sending a searing pain throughout his body.</p>

  <p>Or sometimes, a few Wind Laws collided with each other, forming a few tiny wind blades that swept over the warriors...</p>

  <p>Zheng's speed wasn't fast, but he looked extremely calm and collected as he quietly sized up this world filled with all sorts of laws.</p>

  <p>These Law Powers didn't fuse together. They only intertwined with each other after being shattered!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng noticed that a few of the Time Laws had gathered together and formed into a small ball, shooting towards him. His eyes followed the disturbance through the air as it raced towards him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng extended his hand and gently poked the small ball. The moment his finger entered the ball, his speed suddenly decreased markedly. However, after calmly circulating the Time Law, Luo Zheng managed to offset the effect of the Time Laws in the ball. Then the ball shattered like soap bubbles.</p>

  <p>'When the laws are intertwined together, there is a very familiar feeling, '</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought. After he entered the Enchanted Barrier Tower, Luo Zheng had become a bit absent-minded. It was this odd feeling of familiarity that distracted him.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a long time, he still couldn't figure out where this feeling of familiarity was coming from�</p>

  <p>Layla had long since rushed to the front of the group; while Luo Zheng lagged behind, and was still at the back. There were even some weaker warriors behind him who were increasing their speed and surpassing Luo Zheng quickly.</p>

  <p>As they passed Luo Zheng, all of these martial artists had looks of surprise on their faces. They had thought that Luo Zheng was strong as he had got the attention of Yolande and Layla, but they were astounded that he wasn't in the lead with the other warriors.</p>

  <p>'This fellow doesn't use life vitality to protect himself. It will be extremely difficult for him to travel through this Law Storm like that.</p>

  <p>What is he trying to do?' they all thought in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Of course Luo Zheng didn't care about the strange gazes which the others directed at him. He maintained his speed and moved forward at a steady pace.</p>

  <p>This group of martial artists could fly very fast given their current advanced cultivation. If it weren't for the Law Storm, it probably would only have taken them a quarter of an hour to reach the goal of travelling a thousand miles into the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>However, the further they went, the more terrifying the Law Storm became, and as a result, this greatly slowed down their speed.</p>

  <p>Outside of the Enchanted Barrier Tower, on the rooftop of an ancient building, the many leaders and vice leaders of the palaces sat around a large round table. As for the old man in the cotton clothes, he was sitting in the center. They were all closely watching what was happening in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>"There are a few kids who are starting to speed up. He-he!" the old man in the cotton clothes said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>One of the leaders laughed lightly and said, "The one rushing in front seems to be Kunal Fang, a warrior from our Ice Might Palace! Hehe, it seems like Kunal Fang will be the first to reach the one thousand miles!"</p>

  <p>"It's not a competition of speed. He who laughs last, laughs best. Only the one who sticks it out to the end, and reaches the furthest, is the best."</p>

  <p>Another leader retorted, though a shadow of doubt flickered in his face.</p>

  <p>His own warriors were not near the front, and he worried that they would not succeed at this challenge.</p>

  <p>The old man in the cotton clothes faintly smiled and said, "In this Passing the Torch, I think that girl will be the best!"</p>

  <p>After saying that, he pointed in the distance, and the gazes of the many leaders of the palaces landed on Layla�</p>

  <p>"A warrior from the Mist Palace?"</p>

  <p>"That girl is called Layla Ai, if memory serves me right?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, she has potential. However, it is still too early to come to this conclusion�"</p>

  <p>Layla was indeed outstanding, but there were also some super talents in the other twelve palaces. Their strengths were not to be underestimated, and they weren't about to be defeated that easily.</p>

  <p>The old man in the cotton clothes shook his head resolutely and said,</p>

  <p>"You all know, I have always been accurate with my judgment of people!</p>

  <p>This Layla Ai is the most outstanding. Her excellence far surpasses that of talents in a general sense."</p>

  <p>The faces of the other leaders darkened when they heard this. After all, the thirteen palaces had always been on par with each other. In the competitions of the Passing the Torch, their rankings came with ups and downs, but the disparity was not too great. This maintained a kind of status quo and kept the challenge more or less even.</p>

  <p>"This Layla Ai is Kyron's disciple. It is said that she has the fate to lead the world of chaos. It is not strange that she is so outstanding. Actually, strictly speaking, she is not a warrior of the Mist Palace! It must be Kyron who suddenly decided to let her participate in the Passing the Torch!" a leader jested lightly.</p>

  <p>"So that explains it..."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed difficult for an ordinary talent to contend against her, since she is a warrior who has the fate of leading the world of chaos, and therefore, a great destiny�"</p>

  <p>When the other leaders of the palaces heard these words, they inwardly heaved a sigh of relief. At least, they could more easily accept what the old man said after they had discovered her background.</p>

  <p>Yolande also nodded slightly and said, "Yes, Layla is not a warrior of our Mist Palace."</p>

  <p>She didn't place her hopes on Layla, so she told them frankly.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, the old man in the cotton clothes pointed at someone and laughed. "This kid is actually the last one!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes swept across the tower and discovered that Luo Zheng was now at the end of the line!</p>

  <p>Thousands of martial artists had formed a long line as they moved forwards through the Law Storm in the tower. Only Luo Zheng was left behind, and he was at the ending of the line. This naturally attracted a lot of attention and speculation.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the palaces also smiled condescendingly. Luo Zheng was the last one that had arrived. Currently, he also stood last in the test of the Enchanted Barrier Tower. It was indeed strange.</p>

  <p>Several of the leaders even glanced at Yolande, their gazes faintly mocking, and she could almost see them shaking their heads imperceptibly.</p>

  <p>"This boy has actually not used the body-protecting life vitality?"</p>

  <p>"Interesting. I don't know why, and he's moving so slowly!"</p>

  <p>Yolande still looked very calm. She believed in Zheng's strength, but she was becoming a bit curious. What was Luo Zheng thinking?!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still kept everything under his control, maintaining a steady speed as he advanced. The fragments of laws in the air were in complete disarray, making it impossible for him to comprehend them. Of course, he wouldn't have comprehended the Original Laws here. This place defied all notions of what should be and what shouldn't be.</p>

  <p>And at this time�</p>

  <p>The dozens of martial artists that were walking at the front of the line had already traveled eight hundred miles. They began to rush forward to cross the one thousand miles line! Everyone wanted to be the first.</p>

  <p>Although the first one to reach the one thousand miles would not receive any extra rewards according to the rules, the old man in the cotton clothes would announce the names of the top ten warriors who had passed the one thousand miles mark. It would also bring honor to the palaces that they belonged to. Warriors were all lured by esteem and prestige.</p>

  <p>Of course, Layla strived hard, though not for the honor of the Mist Palace. She was a very proud warrior. How could she be willing to fall behind? She would not let herself fail and prepared for the final sprint.</p>

  <p>At an extremely fast speed, she charged forward through the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>Right now, she was still ranked third, but her only goal was to become the first�</p>
