<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng bid his time for a while at this height.</p>

  <p>He could already clearly see the trajectory of the blue light dot.</p>

  <p>As he determined the direction it was going in, a bright light flashed in his eyes as his body moved ahead.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Even though the surge of energy within his body was close to its limits, he did not slow down as he rushed forward.</p>

  <p>As per his judgment, he should have an eighty percent chance of making it.</p>

  <p>The warriors on the ground were quite excited.</p>

  <p>"His victory is in sight! He can still maintain such a speed even now!</p>

  <p>He's extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>"Any of those three divine weapons would be invaluable. He will possess one so soon after entering Mist Palace. I really envy him."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng leaped toward the blue light dot, the distance between the two rapidly shrinking.</p>

  <p>The light dot drifted aimlessly. However, Luo Luo Zheng had estimated the possible trajectory in the next few seconds and waited there ahead of time.</p>

  <p>It could be said that Luo Luo Zheng was one step ahead of the light dot in reaching its destination. As the light dot moved, it only came closer to him.</p>

  <p>"It's close!"</p>

  <p>At the moment, a hint of a smile rested on Luo Zheng's face as he stretched his hand to grab the light dot.</p>

  <p>When the light dot was less than a foot away from his hand, it suddenly seemed to have sensed danger ahead and stopped mid-air.</p>

  <p>The smile on Luo Zheng's face froze. As he clenched his teeth, his body flashed as he made a move to grab it.</p>

  <p>However, as he did that, the light dot retreated backward.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, along with the warriors of Weapon House, was greatly surprised.</p>

  <p>"Seriously? I have never heard of anything like this! The light dot has slipped away!"</p>

  <p>It was similar to how Rhydian had been trying to grab the red light dot earlier, but when he almost touched it, it left him.</p>

  <p>The warriors knew that the light dots were floating randomly. In Rhydian's case, they blamed it on his misfortune. They thought that if his luck had been a little better, he would not have failed.</p>

  <p>But the way the blue light dot moved away just now was outrageous.</p>

  <p>The moment it was about to reach Luo Luo Zheng, it stopped abruptly. When Luo Luo Zheng had reached out to grab it, it looked like it darted away at will.</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not let it bother him too much. He did not want to waste more of his time and was not discouraged by failure. On the contrary, he tried his best to maintain his height. As he had leaped toward the light dot, his body fell four feet down. He now slowly ascended, his face beginning to turn stormy. It was quite difficult for any warrior to maintain his or her height while at the same time resisting the great gravitational force.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors below were displeased.</p>

  <p>All of them, including Rhydian, turned their gazes onto the white-eyebrowed elder in unison.</p>

  <p>Surely, Rhydian did not want to speak up for Luo Luo Zheng. But like Luo Luo Zheng, he too almost grabbed onto a first-rank divine weapon, but disappointingly, it slipped out of his hands. He wondered if the white-eyebrowed elder was playing tricks on them.</p>

  <p>In his heart, he knew it was just that he was down on his luck. But if he expressed his suspicion about the situation like the others, he would at least save face. Everyone clearly believed that the white-eyebrowed elder was playing tricks, and that what happened to Rhydian was not because the latter was weak.</p>

  <p>Sensing everyone's eyes on him, the white-eyebrowed elder grimaced awkwardly. 'Oh, heavens, ' he thought. 'I shouldn't have manipulated the dots so obviously. Now it has aroused suspicion.'</p>

  <p>"Well..." He coughed dryly to conceal his embarrassment before saying,</p>

  <p>"There must be a remnant of intelligence contained within the weapon of the former leader. If you want to catch the sword, I'm afraid you will have to work harder."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

  <p>"I see. It looks like the weapons have intelligence. That's incredible!"</p>

  <p>The warriors did not dare to question the white-eyebrowed elder's claim, but the expressions on their faces and the tones of their voices revealed that they did not believe what he said. Even a child would find it hard to believe such a lie.</p>

  <p>Whether or not Luo Luo Zheng obtained the weapon of the former leader was of no concern to the warriors. However, since Luo Luo Zheng had already come this far, they kind of hoped that he would succeed. It would be a bit disappointing to witness his failure.</p>

  <p>What was more, if Luo Luo Zheng were to succeed in this challenge, it would set an example for them. Perhaps in the future, they too would be able to ascend two hundred feet into the dome and obtain a weapon of a former palace leader.</p>

  <p>This was why they were unhappy with the white-eyebrowed elder.</p>

  <p>Now, the white-eyebrowed elder was more embarrassed. He was considered to be upright. He felt humiliated doing such a thing and was afraid that bad reputation would befall him. After all, he was the one who said that the weapons in Weapon House belonged to whoever caught them, while he also manipulated the light dots to escape whoever approached them. Was this not a trick?</p>

  <p>He did not intend to keep the weapons to himself. He was merely in charge of Weapon House and was not concerned with who got their hands on the weapons. He really only wanted to test Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Having learned a lesson, Luo Luo Zheng was much more careful before his second attack. He now knew that the blue light dot could evade him on purpose.</p>

  <p>It would be even more difficult to catch it.</p>

  <p>He reflected on what to do now. Just flying at this height was already so difficult, and the blue light dot was doing its best to escapee him. It was obvious that one could hardly catch it.</p>

  <p>But even in this situation, Luo Luo Zheng chose not to give up.</p>

  <p>He had encountered many more difficult situations in the past. There was no danger to his life at Weapon House, so he mustered all his strength and charged towards the blue light dot once again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng accelerated ahead, the light dot also sped up. At the moment, Luo Luo Zheng was like an eagle chasing down the hummingbird that had always been incomparably agile.</p>

  <p>Due to gravity, however, Luo Zheng's speed was greatly reduced. Moreover, the light dot was fast and flexible. After both of them circled the dome a few times, he had no choice but to stop in the end. He breathed heavily as he stared at the light dot.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the warriors below were speechless.</p>

  <p>It was already a miracle that Luo Luo Zheng could fly up to a height of two hundred feet, but he was also able to continuously circle around at that height.</p>

  <p>While they were surprised at Luo Zheng's strength, they were even more angry at the white-eyebrowed elder.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, no one had dared to speak up because they did not want to offend the elder.</p>

  <p>Before long, someone broke the silence. "This is unfair. Why don't you control the other light dots too, so that we never get a single weapon?</p>

  <p>Then the Mist Palace is going to make great profits!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. We don't even stand a chance when we pay three hundred life vitality jades for just one try. Let's spread the news around! Tell everyone not to be fooled by Weapon House!"</p>

  <p>"This is injustice! This is unfair!"</p>

  <p>The voices of the warriors grew louder and louder and the atmosphere grew tense. Some of the warriors stepped forward to the white-eyebrowed elder. "Elder Yue, have you tricked us?"</p>

  <p>"That's right. If you don't want to give us the weapons, just tell us frankly. Don't fool us!"</p>

  <p>"Hey man! Come down. You can't get the weapon. Elder Yue is just making fun of you!"</p>

  <p>As the crowd clamored, the white-eyebrowed elder could no longer hold back his misery. His face was red from embarrassment. If this news were to get out, no warrior would come to the Weapon House again. That had not been the original intention.</p>

  <p>He had just discovered that although Luo Luo Zheng could not catch the light dot by himself, his physical strength was extraordinary. Luo Luo Zheng managed to keep himself at a height of two hundred feet. As soon as his height was lowered, he unfailingly increased it again.</p>

  <p>The white-eyebrowed elder had no way to determine the limits to Luo Zheng's strength. If he increased the gravity of the divine texture by several times, Luo Luo Zheng might be unable to withstand it. However, it was troublesome to modify the divine texture.</p>

  <p>As the elder stood being ridiculed by everyone in a slight daze, Luo Luo Zheng took it as an opportunity to rush forward.</p>

  <p>He had already noticed the situation below and could guess what was happening. Losing no time in taking advantage of this, he once again moved toward the blue light dot. He drained almost all of his potential and increased his speed substantially. Luo Luo Zheng reached out to grab the blue light dot and then descended at full tilt. Steadily, he landed on the ground and a sharp sword of astonishing length appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had now obtained the sword, the other warriors did not stop accusing the white-eyebrowed elder. The scene seemed to be getting a bit out of control.</p>
