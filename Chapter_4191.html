<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This time, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others in the chaos didn't join Zheng in his journey to the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Including Zheng himself, there were a total of forty humans.</p>

  <p>The second they stepped into the Jade Pure Realm, thirty three of them died on the spot. Only seven remained.</p>

  <p>Everyone was shocked, but they couldn't say they were surprised.</p>

  <p>"Well... Is this one of the techniques of the Snake Spirit King?" the Snake Goddess asked sadly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said it was called the Space Devouring Technique," Zheng answered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's soul floated out from Zheng's head. "This is the theurgy of a Holy Item named the Space Guiding Stone," he explained. "The Snake Spirit King has been prepared."</p>

  <p>"Has the Snake Spirit King been hiding here all the time?" Fuxi asked, whipping his head alertly.</p>

  <p>The surrounding environment was as quiet as ever. No one could sense the auras of Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "He doesn't even need to be here. With the Limited Omnipotent Stone, he monitors everything that goes on in the Jade Pure Realm, including our current conversation."</p>

  <p>"Is the Limited Omnipotent Stone really so powerful?" Fuxi's eyes widened in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord huffed, "I already mentioned this before we set out. You weren't listening carefully!"</p>

  <p>He had found out about some of the Snake Spirit King's methods through Elder Xue. In addition, he had been lurking in the Jade Pure Realm for so many years, so it was only natural he learned about some of the Snake Spirit King's theurgies, but he didn't know them all.</p>

  <p>"Before we had set out, I knew that this trip would be riddled with danger, but I didn't expect that we would have to suffer such heavy losses," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a pained expression.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was much calmer. "Since their souls are kept in the Civilization Artifact, they would be onlookers like me now."</p>

  <p>If the chaos was truly destroyed, or even downgraded, all the creatures in the chaos would be killed. The humans here had lived for a long time, so it didn't really make any difference if they died sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Despite that fact, everyone still wallowed in despair. Just then, Eastern Emperor Taiyi noticed something stirring in the distance. "What's going on over there?"</p>

  <p>When everyone turned to look, they saw the Monkey Spirit King waiting for the other Treacherous Beings to recover. As Cornelius's former companion in battle, how could he not know about the Space Devouring Technique?</p>

  <p>Yet it didn't matter how powerful the Space Devouring Technique was, because it couldn't harm a Treacherous Being. Thus, the Monkey Spirit King only needed to wait patiently for the Monkey Masters to recover.</p>

  <p>However, the Monkey Spirit King was looking straight at Zheng with an unreadable expression. Then, he turned around abruptly and ran away, followed by the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>His huge body should have made the earth tremble when he ran.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng and the others didn't feel the vibration. There was no sound or aura fluctuation. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi hadn't accidentally seen it, Zheng and the others wouldn't have noticed them running away.</p>

  <p>"What happened? Why is the Monkey Spirit King running away?"</p>

  <p>Gonggong asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Damn it, we have to catch up! Let's go!" the Snake Goddess cried in disbelief, poised to run after them.</p>

  <p>It hadn't been easy, gaining the support of the Monkey Spirit Sect. They weren't going to let them go so easily.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Zheng were already rushing towards the receding figure of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Although Fuxi and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had consumed a large amount of bloodline power resisting the Space Devouring Technique, they still managed to rush after the Monkey Spirit King with incredible speed. At the rate they were going, they should have caught up to him in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>However, even as they were dashing across the Jade Pure Realm, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>The distance between them and the Monkey Spirit King did not close, but instead grew bigger and bigger, until the Monkey Spirit King had disappeared from their sight. Meanwhile, it looked like they were running in place.</p>

  <p>"There is something strange about the space here..." Fuxi spoke, stretching out one hand.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Hundreds of black and white Eight Diagrams marks shot into the distance.</p>

  <p>However, the Eight Diagrams marks stopped abruptly before they could get very far.</p>

  <p>"It's the space wall! Break it!"</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The black and white Eight Diagrams marks exploded along the surface of the invisible space wall.</p>

  <p>The invisible wall didn't budge, even after Fuxi's vicious attack.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi also joined in on the action.</p>

  <p>As he gently pinched his fingers against each other, a sword suddenly materialized in his hand.</p>

  <p>Raising his arms above his head, he slashed his blade downwards, slicing at the invisible wall.</p>

  <p>The golden light streaked along the surface of the space wall, forming a golden river that was several hundred feet long.</p>

  <p>If there was nothing in its way, the golden river would've reached thousands of miles away. One could only imagine how much power was contained within it.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how powerful the golden river was, it stopped silently the moment it touched the space wall. It couldn't move in the slightest, as though the invisible wall were a dam that blocked it.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face fell.</p>

  <p>"This is the Space Guiding Wall," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord explained calmly. "You, as well as your attacks, can only approach the space wall as much as you want, but you won't be able to touch it."</p>

  <p>This didn't mean the space wall was unbreakable, but that there was a rule which prevented any attacks from reaching it.</p>

  <p>"Is this also the ability of the Space Guiding Stone?" the Snake Goddess asked, frowning deeply.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord affirmed with a nod.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had repeatedly emphasized the power of Holy Items.</p>

  <p>However, the human heroes had mastered the Blood-controlling Method, and their strength had enhanced greatly, which boosted their confidence.</p>

  <p>They were all under the impression that these so-called "Holy Items" were just stronger Other Shore Tokens and wouldn't be as strong as the bloodline power.</p>

  <p>However, no one expected that upon arrival, most of them would drop dead.</p>

  <p>Zheng silently approached the invisible wall and reached out his finger.</p>

  <p>As his finger approached the space wall, something strange happened. It should've touched the space wall, but he couldn't feel anything. Stranger still was the fact that half of his finger seemed to squeeze into the space then abruptly disappear.</p>

  <p>When he withdrew his hand, it quickly returned to its original state.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's not going to be easy to break the space wall," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said as he watched Zheng poke at the wall.</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, Zheng had already launched himself right into the space wall, crashing into it. Then, his body seemed to distort, as though he was being squeezed along the edge of the wall. However, he felt no pain, nor was he injured in any way.</p>

  <p>"This distance is enough. Break the wall."</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice came from the edge of the wall.</p>

  <p>This wall built by the Space Guiding Stone was indeed very ingenious.</p>

  <p>Zheng found that it had used most of the power in the space-time quadrant, but as the owner of the ancestry-level bloodline, he could still easily find a method to get around it.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly twisted his body like a snake, and at the same time, the invisible space wall began to twist like the rippling water.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Deafening sounds of glass being shattered rang, and the space wall twisted a few times before crumbling into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>The invisible barrier had disappeared, but the scenery in the distance did not change at all. But since it had taken them some time, the Monkey Spirit King was long gone by now.</p>
