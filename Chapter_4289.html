<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng slightly raised his right hand.</p>

  <p>More invisible blades emerged and shot towards the space doors.</p>

  <p>As they penetrated through the bodies of the Troubled Creatures, these blades hit the surface of the space doors.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Crack!</p>

  <p>The space doors were actually as fragile as a piece of glass in the face of Zheng's invisible blades. He was able to effortlessly break them into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, just as Zheng shattered them, more space doors suddenly appeared around him.</p>

  <p>With this, more Troubled Creatures continued to swarm and rush out.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but snort at the sight of all the new Troubled Creatures that surfaced, but he just continued to attack them and kill them off without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Burial Land could witness the merciless death of the Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>Although it seemed that these Troubled Creatures were flooding the area, it only took Zheng a few moments before he finished them off.</p>

  <p>As the number of the space doors increased, Zheng also released more and more blades. The rate at which he killed the Troubled Creatures was much faster than their appearance. That was why he was able to fully obliterate them along with the space doors.</p>

  <p>However, after killing them off, Zheng suddenly noticed that there was something wrong with the bodies that he had slain.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had successfully killed them off, their corpses didn't actually fall to the ground. Instead, they floated in the air as if they weren't affected by gravity. From afar, they looked like black insects in various shapes that hovered over a large area.</p>

  <p>"Did you finally realize?" The Snake Spirit King's voice sounded in a contemptuous tone. "Too bad for you, it's too late!"</p>

  <p>The black corpses began to move and merged with the other bodies until they formed a humongous hand that attempted to grab Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is that it?" Zheng said with an unimpressed tone.</p>

  <p>He then narrowed his eyes and gathered his power. He summoned countless invisible blades that formed a storm around him, spinning from top to bottom.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the invisible blades were about to set out, they were suddenly destroyed.</p>

  <p>"What the hell happened?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was taken aback and was confused at the sudden turn of events.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Do you think that this is still your territory?</p>

  <p>This area has already been contaminated by the Troubled Creatures. This space is now under our control!</p>

  <p>Prepare to die!"</p>

  <p>The enormous hand made up of the corpses of the Troubled Creatures completely grasped Zheng's body and exerted a tremendous force.</p>

  <p>Splat!</p>

  <p>In an instant, Zheng's whole body was crushed into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! That's what you get for being too arrogant. You're only human.</p>

  <p>How dare you— "</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King suddenly stopped in the middle of his sentence, surprised at what he saw from afar.</p>

  <p>Another avatar of Zheng appeared outside the contaminated area. He stared at him with an indifferent expression and said, "The bodies of the Troubled Creatures are actually filled with the energy of the Pollution Extreme Form, which is a kind of energy to contaminate the space. I've never used it before, so I wanted to verify what it could do. What are you so happy about?"</p>

  <p>The real Zheng was still on the jadeite platform, while the Snake Spirit King was facing his avatar. He could actually summon as many avatars as he could if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>"You arrogant bastard!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King felt so humiliated with Zheng's mockery that he was filled with rage.</p>

  <p>He quickly controlled the black corpses and formed a huge hand again, aiming directly at Zheng. However, Zheng didn't even dodge, and the big hand crushed him again.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, another avatar appeared.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng raised his hand, and balls of light the size of marbles condensed behind him.</p>

  <p>These balls of light were not created from his omnipotent power, but rather from the Purification Extreme Form, which could instantly purify the space that was contaminated by the Pollution Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The balls of light rained on the black corpses torrentially.</p>

  <p>They drilled into them one after another.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the black color of the corpses quickly faded and turned into the color of the flesh.</p>

  <p>These countless flesh-colored corpses floated in the air and gave off a terrifying aura. Soon enough, the contaminated space returned to its original state.</p>

  <p>If Zheng hadn't obtained the Heavenly Ring Staff, he wouldn't be able to do anything about the Pollution Extreme Form. As a result, he would have no way to prevent the downgrader from polluting and devouring his entire primitive land. But now, it didn't even take him much effort to restore it and launch a counterattack.</p>

  <p>"This is our place. Although the Burial Land forcefully broke in, they still wouldn't be able to do anything with Zheng." The Snake Goddess assessed that the situation they were in was much better than she imagined.</p>

  <p>"But I still didn't have the chance to make a move." Geoffrey was sulking a bit because he had been itching to fight in this war. However, Zheng had already blocked the Burial Land by only using a few of his avatars.</p>

  <p>"Will you continue to hide behind the Snake Spirit King and these weak creatures? I didn't expect that you were such a spineless coward!" Zheng continued to unleash his invisible blades to kill the Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>From time to time, he would use the Purification Extreme Form when the black corpses had already accumulated to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>"My master doesn't need to deal with you personally! You're not even worth his effort!" the Snake Spirit King sneered.</p>

  <p>At the same time, several huge space doors appeared.</p>

  <p>This time, the Snake Spirit King summoned Troubled Creatures that were more peculiar than the previous ones.</p>

  <p>As the huge space doors opened, ginormous Troubled Creatures rushed out one after another. There were giant snakes with multiple heads, ghosts with long arms, spiders with several legs, and many others.</p>

  <p>"Really? You think that these could make a difference?"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at all the creatures with a taunting expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Except for their obviously larger bodies, these Troubled Creatures were no stronger than the previous ones.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't even change his way of attacking. He just increased the number of invisible blades to slaughter these creatures.</p>

  <p>In no time, they were all cut to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King didn't stop summoning these Troubled Creatures. More and more of them came in various forms and sizes, fearlessly rushing and sacrificing themselves.</p>

  <p>Then, there were millions of them…</p>

  <p>Tens of millions…</p>

  <p>Hundreds of millions…</p>

  <p>However, all these waves of black corpses were just purified by Zheng. The downgrader would never succeed in contaminating the primitive land by just using the Pollution Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Hilario had been observing in silence as Zheng continued to slaughter the Troubled Creatures. Although the Pollution Extreme Form was easily resolved by Zheng, he still couldn't shake the feeling that there was something wrong going on.</p>

  <p>He clearly knew that the downgrader was an extremely intelligent being.</p>

  <p>There should be some meaning behind all these seemingly useless things that he was doing.</p>

  <p>'Is he doing something while our attentions are focused on these creatures?'</p>

  <p>Then, Hilario suddenly raised his head and looked at the corner of the Burial Land that pierced into the primitive land. It was just a small part with respect to the entirety of the Burial Land, but it was still quite huge.</p>

  <p>After all, the Burial Land was large enough to swallow two primitive lands.</p>

  <p>'Swallow?'</p>

  <p>Hilario realized something. His eyes instantly widened. "Zheng! Project the image outside the primitive land!"</p>

  <p>The real Zheng, who was standing on the jadeite platform, looked at Hilario with furrowed brows but still did what he was told. As he pointed to the air, the image of the outside was projected on the jadeite platform. From there, they could clearly see the corner of the Burial Land that drilled into the primitive land.</p>

  <p>"Is there something wrong? What do we need to see here?" Kincaid asked as he was also a little confused with Hilario's sudden request.</p>

  <p>After studying the projected image, Hilario continued, "Zheng, can you try and push that corner out?"</p>

  <p>"Huh? I'm afraid that's difficult to do," Zheng said while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Doing so would actually be equivalent to lifting the entire Burial Land upwards.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, he could easily prevent the Burial Land from invading further into the primitive land, but it would be difficult to completely get rid of it. He actually preferred to fight the downgrader head-on, but the latter had never shown himself.</p>

  <p>"Just try it!" Hilario insisted.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng didn't really understand why Hilario was strongly suggesting he do it, he still followed and did his best to push the corner.</p>

  <p>With that, his avatar raised his hand.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the power of the entire primitive land was directed to that corner.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>With the avatar's full power, the corner was slowly raised to a height, but it was quickly pressed down hard again.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it. It's too heavy," Zheng said as he turned to Hilario.</p>

  <p>Then, Hilario pointed at the image of the outside and said, "Even if it was just a little, you were able to lift the corner of the Burial Land, but the image didn't move one bit. It means that the image is fake! It's just an illusion created by the downgrader!"</p>
