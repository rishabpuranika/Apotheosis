<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi made sure he was well-prepared prior to coming to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>However, the one thing he still needed was the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng eyed him curiously. "What are you going to summon from the Other Shore?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Fuxi simply smiled. "You'll know soon enough," he replied cryptically before tossing the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit in his hand as he sat cross-legged on the step.</p>

  <p>The steps on both sides of Eastern Emperor Taiyi were reserved for Pearce and Auden.</p>

  <p>Of course, since the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were here, the two naturally had to show their respect and let them sit on the steps.</p>

  <p>As Fuxi sat down, the real Fuxi above Zheng's head spoke. "Why do I feel like this duplicate is even more arrogant than me?"</p>

  <p>In the 77th civilization, Fuxi was known for being an unparalleled warrior but also an extremely arrogant man. His talent was incredibly remarkable and his strength was beyond compare.</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess and her duplicate smiled, knowing full-well Fuxi's reputation and personality.</p>

  <p>Whilst everyone waited, Zheng turned to the Snake Goddess. "How are Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin on the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>Everyone's faces darkened at the mention of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Shortly after arriving at the Supreme Dragon Hall, the Snake Goddess told everyone present Eastern Emperor Taiyi's situation. She calmly repeated this to Zheng. "I immediately got the news when Yasamin got trapped on the Other Shore. With Eastern Emperor Taiyi's invitation, I followed him to save her with no hesitation. Unfortunately, in his haste to save Yasamin, Eastern Emperor Taiyi put himself in danger."</p>

  <p>In fact, she was so close to rescuing Eastern Emperor Taiyi some time ago, but her efforts were in vain.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to get Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi out of harm's way.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi came over not only because of the Descending Rings and the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, but also to impart the news regarding Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill and some masters of the Oneness Sky Palace planned to move all members of the Oneness Sky Palace to the Pear Hill. Pearce, however, did not agree.</p>

  <p>If all their members moved into the Pear Hill, it could cause a series of unintended consequences. This matter needed to be planned and considered meticulously.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has already passed through the Soul City. If he is able to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation, then he'll be able to reach the Eternal Scroll Painting. Once he does that, our Oneness Sky Palace will finally have an Eternal Warrior who can save Eastern Emperor Taiyi," Athemar remarked with a smile.</p>

  <p>After ancient times, there was nobody who was able to become the Eternal Warrior and reach the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>If Zheng managed the impossible, then it would no doubt cause quite the stir in the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>"If I am able to step into Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, I will definitely go and save Eastern Emperor Taiyi," Zheng promised.</p>

  <p>His definitive reply made Athemar smile with relief.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Fuxi suddenly opened his eyes and retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Descending Ring floated near him along with the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>He gently stretched out his hand and flicked the Chaotic Source Spirit towards the direction of the ring.</p>

  <p>"Da!"</p>

  <p>In a flash, the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit shot straight towards the Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>The moment the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit touched the ring, it quickly melted into golden liquid that flowed around the Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>Soon, the entire ring turned golden.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>There was a buzzing noise as the Descending Ring shook and a small creature appeared below.</p>

  <p>It was a dog with bright fur and was only the size of a fist.</p>

  <p>The dog was extremely adorable but everyone in the Oneness Sky Palace looked at it cautiously.</p>

  <p>Its aura was extremely powerful, no weaker than the Snake Goddess' and Fuxi's!</p>

  <p>The dog opened its eyes and looked around curiously.</p>

  <p>"Have I descended?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>He was nervous but there shouldn't be any problems. According to the captain of the Black Ship, directly using the Descending Ring would trigger the punishment of the truth, but making use of the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit would be able to deter such a disaster.</p>

  <p>However, this was his first attempt so he couldn't be too sure.</p>

  <p>The dog looked around and took in its surroundings. 'So this is the world below. The people around here don't seem to be weak, ' it thought.</p>

  <p>This dog was an Other Shore creature within Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Its name was Augury Dog.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog had a good relationship with Fuxi and followed him all the time when the latter reached Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Since it was a creature of the Other Shore and had never entered the Source World, its understanding was limited to Fuxi's stories.</p>

  <p>According to what it learned from before, the Source World should be full of weak creatures, but why did the people in this place seem so powerful?</p>

  <p>Fuxi smiled at the Augury Dog. "The Source World is bigger than you think..."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, an invisible wave appeared on top of the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace could feel just how powerful this wave was. Even the Other Shore Realm warriors and civilians were aware of it, having subconsciously lifted their heads towards the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The dog's face paled as the power seemed to be aimed at itself.</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be..." Fuxi mumbled with a dark expression.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>This sudden wave of truth energy was so powerful that it was enough to destroy heaven and earth. It swept over their heads and quickly went away, not landing on the dog at all.</p>

  <p>"Awoo!"</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog couldn't help but let out a roar after noticing that the crisis had passed.</p>

  <p>Fuxi himself breathed a sigh of relief. "It's done!"</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess, the real Fuxi, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were also obviously pleased and excited at the result.</p>

  <p>The truth energy had descended and they knew better than anyone what this meant.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, if you could descend to the Source World, then you'd be able to preside over the situation. You'd be able to lead the human race towards prosperity!" The Snake Goddess rejoiced. "I just don't know which realm of the Three Purities Stage you're in. If I join hands with Fuxi, perhaps we can help you out..."</p>

  <p>He now had the means to descend, but, there was an even bigger problem.</p>

  <p>The outstanding human heroes had also been trapped there for a long time.</p>

  <p>So many chaotic eras had passed but all efforts the Primeval Lord of Heaven made were in vain.</p>

  <p>He sported a bitter smile on his face. "We are trapped in the Jade Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>Everyone's hearts lurched at the mention of the words "Jade Pure Realm".</p>

  <p>The Three Purities Stage was divided into the Grand Pure Realm, the Supreme Pure Realm, and the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog belonged to the outermost layer: the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Those who could enter the Supreme Pure Realm were supernormal to the Augury Dog's eyes. How could this old man in front of it reach the Jade Pure Realm?</p>

  <p>That place only existed in legends the Augury Dog had learned. Some people were able to enter this realm but none ever came out.</p>
