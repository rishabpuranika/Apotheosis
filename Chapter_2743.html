<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fiend race could not be counted as a race with countless members.</p>

  <p>There were only less than a thousand fiends in the entire Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>The four fiends in the huge hall were the actual commanders of the fiend race.</p>

  <p>If there was a big decision to make, the four fiends would vote for it.</p>

  <p>"There is no way I would back you," Stuart said sternly.</p>

  <p>His gaze traveled past Gallio and was fixated on a giant mural behind him.</p>

  <p>The mural had a depiction of an old man, holding a book. Countless fiends were surrounding this divine citizen.</p>

  <p>Right below these fiends were a myriad of True Gods in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Just like the divine citizens, the fiends also had their respective faith.</p>

  <p>And their belief rested on the ordinary old man, named Roberto Wang, in the divine land.</p>

  <p>During his entire lifespan, he hardly achieved any milestones. By the end of his time, he was only a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>Since he did not break through to the True God Realm, he could not live in the divine land forever.</p>

  <p>In short, he was nothing more than a negligible existence in the divine land.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for his mundane lifespan, Roberto Wang could not have had such a drastic effect on others.</p>

  <p>In all fairness, Roberto Wang had a very mediocre talent in cultivation.</p>

  <p>He could only become a proving godly warrior. That was his limit. He did not possess the required talents or capacity to become a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>As time went by, Roberto Wang's lifespan also gradually drew to an end.</p>

  <p>But in his last days, he suddenly began to form different legends.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the Sacred race had been wiped off. And the newly born divine citizens were still getting used to their new surroundings.</p>

  <p>Slowly, the legends that he made, began to spread everywhere.</p>

  <p>The most popular and widespread of these legends was of the fiend race.</p>

  <p>This race did not possess a specific surname. Hence, they were named like Gallio, Stuart etc.</p>

  <p>But despite this, they possessed a high intellect.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, they were physically well built and had a strong addiction to killing.</p>

  <p>They lived in the Abyss Demon Region, among all the other evil creatures of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Soon Roberto Wang's random stories were passed through word of mouth, by countless divine citizens. And then the Abyss Demon Region emerged.</p>

  <p>So in a way, Roberto Wang did create the fiend race.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the eyes of those fiends, his status was naturally extraordinary, despite being only a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>"Well, since the three of you are of the same opinion, I will not object anymore," Gallio smiled and gently snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>Three fiend servants carried a huge silver plate and gently placed it in front of Gallio.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself to this delectable meal, Stuart!" Gallio said as he placed the silver plate at the other side of the round table.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Atop the silver plate was a lid that was trembling continuously, giving the impression of a live creature inside.</p>

  <p>Stuart gave a small smile as he walked towards the round table.</p>

  <p>Soon fiend servants entered, carrying a huge wine glass, filled with surging magma.</p>

  <p>Stuart lifted the lid off the silver plate, wherein lay a very grotesque looking fish.</p>

  <p>"You damned fiends! You will go extinct one day!</p>

  <p>You have never emerged from the dark Abyss Demon Region nor seen daylight all your lives. What a pitiful life you lead! You even think you are strong...</p>

  <p>I..."</p>

  <p>As soon as the lid was taken off, the fish rattled out innumerable curses.</p>

  <p>But Stuart didn't seem to be angry at all.</p>

  <p>This was not the first time, the fiend race had seen or eaten this fish.</p>

  <p>They had devoured this fish, countless number of times. The latter did not have the strength to challenge the former, so it always cursed them with the most vicious words.</p>

  <p>For the fiend race, they had heard plenty of it and were hardly affected.</p>

  <p>No matter how repulsive the fish looked, its taste was ten times more delicious. It was soft like butter and simply melted in one's mouth.</p>

  <p>Stuart picked up the wine glass and poured the magma into the plate.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Immediately the fish created an enchanted barrier to block the magma from outside.</p>

  <p>Stuart outstretched his little finger and lightly jabbed at the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier was like a soap bubble that was destroyed instantly.</p>

  <p>Soon the boiling magma engulfed the fish with a sizzling sound. The fish started screaming as the magma touched its body. In an instant, the howling died.</p>

  <p>Stuart sniffed the fragrance and said intoxicatedly, "I want something even more pleasant to go with this fantastic meal!"</p>

  <p>Another fiend immediately clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>A dozen human girls quickly emerged from the depths of the hall.</p>

  <p>Their porcelain skin was soft and their features were quite striking. They were measly covered with a translucent chiffon cloth.</p>

  <p>When the titillating music floated around, they started swaying as if they were drugged.</p>

  <p>In reality, they were all top-rank True Gods and some were even members of the big clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>They were captured by the fiend race, as they were travelling through the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>They were held as captives, with no choice whatsoever.</p>

  <p>After a torturous period, they were soon numbed from the humiliation.</p>

  <p>They could barely feel and sense anything.</p>

  <p>Admiring the beautiful music and dance of the girls, these fiends soon began to enjoy themselves.</p>

  <p>Soon after Stuart devoured the fish, it was reborn in the sea of lava in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At the moment of its birth, the strange fish had already launched an enchanted barrier once again.</p>

  <p>"Damn you Roberto Wang! You created those scum and heartless fiends!" the strange fish cursed fiercely.</p>

  <p>The creatures that were born in the Abyss Demon Region were not kind ones. After all, this was where the dark side of all the divine citizens had gathered.</p>

  <p>The strange fish was constantly eaten by the fiend race over and over again. It had heard a lot of secrets of the fiend race on the dining table.</p>

  <p>Therefore it knew this race very well and knew it better than any other creatures.</p>

  <p>After the enchanted barrier was launched, the strange fish swam in the sea of lava continuously.</p>

  <p>Vaguely, it could see a tentacle approaching.</p>

  <p>'Wow! They are going to catch me so soon! Are these beasts so hungry?'</p>

  <p>The fish was somewhat confused with this situation.</p>

  <p>Normally, each time it was eaten, it would be released and left alone for a good period of time.</p>

  <p>As a unique ferocious beast, it was an extremely high-level food in the fiend race, which was not something that ordinary fiends could enjoy.</p>

  <p>'How can this be possible?</p>

  <p>Again? I'm going to be eaten one more time? Isn't that too soon?</p>

  <p>Why can't they leave me alone?'</p>

  <p>The strange fish resisted that tentacle.</p>

  <p>But in the eyes of the strange fish, the tentacle was so tempting, just like the fish itself was so tempting to the fiends.</p>

  <p>Anyway, it would be eaten sooner or later, and it could still enjoy the meal before being eaten!</p>

  <p>'Come on!'</p>

  <p>After a fierce struggle within the fish, it gave in to the temptation and finally bit the tentacle.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng felt the tentacle hanging from his hand suddenly turned heavy. A smile appeared on his face. "Finally it took the bait!"</p>

  <p>Saying that, Zheng heaved the tentacle from the sea of lave.</p>
