<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng was sucked into the black hole, the two Eternal Realm warriors let go of each other's hands, and the black hole disappeared!</p>

  <p>They smiled as though they had won an incredible prize.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a thread as thin as silk appeared behind them, intertwining around itself until it formed a figure of a creature. It was the Eternal Realm warrior that had entangled Luo Zheng earlier!</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others who were knocked out finally regained their senses. When they saw the three Eternal Realm warriors grinning at them in a sinister fashion, their faces fell. Did Luo Zheng just disappear with the black hole?</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>As though they had heard the most absurd question, the three Eternal Realm warriors burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"'Who are we?" one of them echoed sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"How dare you ask us such a stupid question!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's because we have stayed in the Supreme Pure Realm for a long time and the lowly creatures in the Grand Pure Realm have forgotten us," the third one sneered. "Well, it's time to make a name for ourselves once more."</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm warriors looked very experienced.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the Heavenly Eye Vine wasn't worth taking seriously.</p>

  <p>Even the five warriors at the Eternal Realm before them weren't worthy to them.</p>

  <p>They had only targeted Luo Zheng. Now that they had gotten rid of him, the others didn't seem to pose a threat.</p>

  <p>"How arrogant you are!" Ying cried angrily.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan's bean-sized eyes flickered with recognition. "I remember! They are the Eternal Realm Hunters!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others gasped.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunters were known to be a team made up of the Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Besides the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race, the Eternal Realm Hunters had also gained a foothold in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>They never had a stand; they joined neither the Nihility race nor the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>There used to be more than 20 Eternal Realm Hunters, all of whom were outstanding warriors at the Eternal Realm and were extremely good at combat. It was said that they had once fought with the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Although they were defeated by the Grandmaster of Heaven, they still managed to escape from the Nihility race safely. It was easy to tell they were a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>Because they had no stand, as long as they wanted something, they would exhaust all efforts to get it, even if it meant crossing other super forces' paths. Additionally, they had been very active over the years.</p>

  <p>At some point, they were chased by the creatures of other races. A big war took place on a mountain located in the Grand Pure Realm, and they had suffered heavy losses. Only three of them managed to escape.</p>

  <p>These three people were the strongest among all the Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>The creatures of other races gnashed their teeth in hatred, but they could do nothing to the three of them.</p>

  <p>It was not until the three Eternal Realm Hunters found a way to enter the Supreme Pure Realm that peace was finally restored in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others reached the Eternal Realm and went to the Grand Pure Realm, the three Eternal Realm Hunters had already gone to the Supreme Pure Realm, so they had never encountered each other. However, the Eternal Realm Hunters were famous; it was rare for one to not have heard of them.</p>

  <p>As the king of the Ear Mouse race, King Ieuan liked to collect and exchange all kinds of information wherever it went. It knew the Eternal Realm Hunters the best.</p>

  <p>However, even it didn't expect that they'd run into the Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, King Ieuan cupped its hands towards the three Eternal Realm Hunters respectfully. "You three are from the Grand Plain Stage, and all of us are at the Eternal Realm. Why did you attack us?"</p>

  <p>In fact, there was a big difference in the strength of different Eternal Realm warriors. Moreover, in the Grand Plain Stage alone, there were ruling civilizations, and also creatures that were born on the Other Shore, who followed the Finale Way, the Purge Way or the Nihility Way.</p>

  <p>However, the Eternal Realm was only a realm, not a status. There was no need to form relations with other Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>But then again, the vast majority of the Eternal Realm warriors found it difficult to make progress in the Three Purities Stage. After all, they were all on the same stage. Under normal circumstances, they would help each other, except for those who were from opposing forces.</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm Hunters had no enmity with them, so King Ieuan wanted to persuade them to let them be.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunter who could turn into threads laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"You have no enmity with us, but the Element Spirit Civilization has enmity with you."</p>

  <p>"So the famous Eternal Realm Hunters have joined the Element Spirit Civilization?" King Ieuan asked, narrowing its beady eyes.</p>

  <p>The twins at the Eternal Realm were wearing a careless smile on their faces, but when they heard this, their expressions suddenly grew serious. One of them snapped, "What are you talking about? How could we join them? It's just that they're offering us the Bone Fragments Secret Soul if we capture you. So, here we are!"</p>

  <p>The other continued, "Just give up. If you do, we promise to treat you nicely." He smiled mischievously. "Maybe the Element Spirit Civilization will even spare you!"</p>

  <p>"Stop talking to them," the Eternal Realm Hunter behind the twins snapped impatiently. "These people are our targets. Just kill them." With a wave of his hand, he transformed into threads once more that floated in the wind.</p>

  <p>It was after being entangled by the threads that Luo Zheng fell into the black hole without resistance. The threads were not as simple as they looked.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the four human masters didn't plan to sit still and await their deaths. Simultaneously, their eyes lit up as the energy within their bodies surged excitedly.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine continued to extend its sharp thorny vines underground. Its life source was still in Luo Zheng's hands. Even for its own sake, it had to fight desperately these three Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>Only King Ieuan remained unmoving. Instead, it continued negotiating. "I know you are from the Knotting race, and your names are Sawyer and Thurston. Back then, the whole Knotting race was killed by the Element Spirit Civilization. You have a grudge against the Element Spirit Civilization, so why do you help them now?"</p>

  <p>The older brother of the twins was Sawyer, and the younger one was Thurston. The Eternal Realm Hunter behind them was Pearson. These names were given after they became the Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>At the mention of the painful past, hatred flashed in the eyes of Sawyer and Thurston. Sawyer said, "We just want the Bone Fragments Secret Soul. We will never take the Element Spirit Civilization's side. Sooner or later, we will avenge our clansmen!"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan had already expected this. It continued, "The Knotting race used to be a dominating civilization. It is said that in order to complete the Finale Way, tens of billions of its people offered their blood, but in the end, their efforts were all in vain. We really admire them. But now you help the Element Spirit Civilization hinder the completion of the Finale Way. You're holding the candle to the devil!"</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap!"</p>

  <p>Pearson shook his hands, and the threads all over the sky were about to wrap up the crowd.</p>

  <p>Just then, Sawyer suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Pearson by the shoulder. With a faint smile on his face and a crazed look in his eyes, he asked, "The completion of the Finale Way? Do you think you can complete it?"</p>
