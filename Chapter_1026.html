<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1026 Netherworld Shaking </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hell, netherworld, fiends, and ghosts.</p>

  <p>There were many records about these things in Central Region. However, they were all classified as legends that people would normally not be able to see with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>These legends were often described in a mystical but insubstantial manner in all sorts of books and fantasy stories. The authors would also take the liberty of adding a bit of flair in their storytelling.</p>

  <p>The existence of these things was uncertain but, judging from the cyan dragon's words, Eddie was indeed someone who had the fiend lineage.</p>

  <p>Basically, Eddie was a living fiend.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea how Eddie obtained his lineage, but the low-grade sacred weapon in his hands had the ability to summon the Netherworld Yaksha. He could more or less deduce that Eddie got it from either his Nameless Saber or some other method.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he was pretty certain that Eddie he faced right now was even more terrifying than before.</p>

  <p>Had it been in the past, this new information would've probably affected Luo Zheng greatly. However, the current Luo Zheng did not care. It did not matter if Eddie was a fiend or some god from the heavens, Luo Zheng would fight Eddie to the death if need be.</p>

  <p>"It's not enough? In that case, I can still bring up my full strength!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly rushed towards Eddie with a punch loaded with the power of his dragon scales.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Eddie's hand shot out like lightning and blocked Zheng's fist just as it was about to swing down on him.</p>

  <p>None of the Life and Death Realm warriors and war sages could resist Zheng's punch. Just one blow of Zheng's terrifying strength would be enough to destroy them completely. However, Eddie did not avoid the force of Zheng's punch and caught it in his hand. Just as he had blocked Zheng's attack, a strange rune appeared in his eyes� the fiend race's symbol! As the fiend bloodline within him was stimulated, an endless amount of fiend energy began to madly circulate within his body.</p>

  <p>Looking at such a strange pair of eyes sent a chill running down everyone's spine. Even Luo Zheng felt a great pressure weighing down upon him but it was not enough to change his expression.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" Eddie sneered as he grabbed Zheng's fist and raised it high into the air.</p>

  <p>Using some momentum, he swung and threw his opponent directly onto the city wall in front of them.</p>

  <p>As he threw Luo Zheng, Eddie's heavy, mountainous body followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes flashed. Unwilling to stand by any longer, she jumped down from the city wall. "Action!" she shouted.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng crashed into the city wall, there was a possibility that it would collapse.</p>

  <p>Eddie had now taken advantage of this battle and used it as a chance to destroy the city.</p>

  <p>The warriors on top of the wall shot out one after another upon Yudie's command. Meanwhile, runes had begun to shine on top of the city wall; these had been drawn in the Runic Tower and were now activated one after another.</p>

  <p>Most of the runes were defensive while others served to enhance a warrior's speed, strength, and life vitality recovery speed.</p>

  <p>The battle had now truly begun.</p>

  <p>The moment the Oracle City's warriors rushed out, the warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect were also quick to take action.</p>

  <p>Under Simon's command, a small unit of independent warriors began to steadily advance.</p>

  <p>The warriors moved in certain, specific ways. Those in the Illuminating Soul Realm moved around ten to twenty feet above the ground, those in the Internal Elixir Realm around one hundred feet above the ground, while those in the Virtual Tribulation Realm maintained around three hundred and forty feet above the ground.</p>

  <p>This was the same strategy they had devised and used back in the River Wave City!</p>

  <p>The strength gathered by over ten thousand independent warriors in each array was equal to that of a Life and Death Realm master. Over one hundred thousand independent warriors formed a dozen square arrays in the battlefield, which meant that the Heavenly Evil Sect had an organized strength equal to that of more than ten Life and Death Realm masters!</p>

  <p>Both sides were on the brink of war, all while Luo Zheng was being hurled towards the city wall at an extremely fast rate.</p>

  <p>However, just before his body could hit the wall, a white figure flashed and floated beside him. Ning Yudie was going to catch him. She knew that the impact would be more than what she could handle. They would crash into the wall together!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng quickly turned his body so that Ning Yudie was in front of him before slamming into the city wall.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The collision left a gaping hole in the wall and many of the runes that had strengthened the defenses flickered and faded away.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, Eddie was just right behind them!</p>

  <p>A cold and sinister smile appeared on Eddie's face. He exuded a domineering Mu Ning that made it feel as if he was a sovereign king of the world as he rushed into the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell Luo Zheng! Supreme Earth Emperor Fist!"</p>

  <p>A mountain-like fist condensed into the air. This one was even bigger and more solid than the previous Supreme Emperor Fist and it was fast swinging down towards Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had turned over to block the fist but Ning Yudie stopped him. "Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>She gently waved her hands and summoned a cold, white mist that slowed down Eddie's shining, golden fist. Just before it could hit them, the mist effectively slowed its descent to the point that it stopped in midair.</p>

  <p>Yudie's figure flashed and struck towards the fist with her halberd.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Her strike immediately dissolved the massive fist.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" Eddie laughed, seemingly not caring at all. "Ning Yudie, it seems your strength has also advanced. If you surrender now, I'll consider letting you marry the crown prince of our Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom."</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng had managed to injure Eddie's son's warrior spirit. Although Eddie had helped his son, Eden, recover, Eden could never be the same again. Eddie knew that his son wanted Ning Yudie to be his woman and it would be a great help if he could make her become his son's wife.</p>

  <p>"You haven't established your divine kingdom yet but you already have a crown prince? Are you talking about your useless son?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked coldly.</p>

  <p>Eddie grinned, "My son? Useless? Ah, you're about to become a dead man, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie gave Eddie a sickeningly sweet smile. "I'm afraid I can't marry your crown prince. You'd have better luck finding someone else."</p>

  <p>She then waved her hand and summoned ice thorns measuring over a thousand feet in length. A slight flick of her wrist had the thorns shooting towards Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Insignificant!"</p>

  <p>Eddie snorted. He had dared to barge into Oracle City alone so he was confident that he could defeat everyone there. His fist emitted a great amount of light as it shattered Yudie's ice thorns one by one into shimmering pieces.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'll have to kill such a beautiful woman without mercy today."</p>

  <p>He then waved his hand as his life vitality surged out of his body like a tidal wave. He once again held his Nameless Saber and pointed it at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>A wave of danger and worry plunged Zheng's heart into a panic. "Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>He grabbed her by the hand and ran away as fast as he could. However, there was a faint, evil grin on Eddie's face as his Nameless Saber began to follow Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"You can't dodge this, Ning Yudie! You will die today! Don't worry. Luo Zheng will follow you soon." The weapon in his hand shook in Eddie's hand as if something appeared into this world and entered the Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>That thing was extremely special. It only appeared for a mere three seconds but it was enough to stun all the warriors, mortals, and peerless masters of Oracle City into silence.</p>

  <p>Even those in the middle of a fight stopped with the feeling that they would die if they didn't. There was a sense of instinctive fear that had washed over everyone so suddenly.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie felt it. It was as if a strange little monster had grabbed their hearts and squeezed them. Just what was hiding inside that Nameless Saber? How terrifying was Eddie's attack?</p>

  <p>There was no time to guess. Eddie's target right now was Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng made it his top priority to escape with her.</p>

  <p>"Netherworld Shaking!"</p>

  <p>Eddie screamed and swung the Nameless Saber towards Ning Yudie.</p>
