<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This window was much different from the one Ziya had opened. It was large enough in size to be considered as a door.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had a strong sense of awareness about the limits of his strength.</p>

  <p>Even if he cultivated under the watchful guidance of Ziya, it was still too risky for him to explore the unknown Abstruse Energy World without the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the support of the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey voluntarily decided to retreat. The fear of the unknown of what might lie on the other side of the window prevented him from crossing it.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey returned to Ziya and debriefed him about what he discovered, it piqued his interest.</p>

  <p>In the past, Ziya had explored a small portion of the vast Abstruse Energy World. Based on all his findings, he had made a conclusion about it. He suspected the existence of other secondary worlds within the boundaries of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>However, there was nowhere to prove Ziya's statement right as he had only scratched the surface when he explored it. The range he could travel in was quite limited back then. He was only able to explore the nearby areas due to the fear of losing the lifeline that was tied to him. If it were to be cut off, the chances of him ever returning would be lost with it.</p>

  <p>But after he was joined by Geoffrey, the range of his activities expanded to a higher degree than before. The only remaining issue was encountering the tentacle monsters on the grassland.</p>

  <p>The tentacle monsters weren't that strong, and they weren't dominant in numbers either. If Ziya could move freely in the Abstruse Energy World, he would obliterate them without breaking a sweat. The only thing holding him back was the fact that he had no fighting ability when he stepped into the boundaries of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"I think we can capture those tentacle monsters in the cave if we fish them out," Geoffrey suggested after studying the situation.</p>

  <p>"Fishing? That's a great idea!" Ziya exclaimed with excitement as he clasped his hands together.</p>

  <p>The days that followed, Geoffrey worked closely with Ziya to put their plan into action. They pulled long ropes into the grassland and tied live cattle and pigs at the ends to act as bait. Ziya created this livestock using the Truth of Three Energy Construction for the specific purpose of using them to reel in the monsters. They didn't possess much intelligence and were rather docile since they didn't even resist while being sent into the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Soon after the traps were set, one after the other, the tentacle monsters were tempted by the livestock and ended up getting fished out and killed by Ziya.</p>

  <p>He was quite a talented fisherman.</p>

  <p>Even though they weren't mighty creatures, the tentacle monsters were smart enough to quickly catch on with what was going on. When they noticed their kind disappearing one after the other, they stopped taking the bait. However, Ziya had other tricks up his sleeve. He quickly replaced the old livestock lure with a more tempting and delicious one, which made it hard to resist not taking a bite. It quickly worked as the tentacle monsters began to munch on it and were later captured.</p>

  <p>Watching the situation unfold, the last remaining tentacle monsters realized they were at a loss and began to retreat from the grassland.</p>

  <p>Once they left, the obstacles in the way of Geoffrey's search were cleared up, and he was able to explore a wider area without having to worry about potential threats. It later amounted to him locating the window that led to another world.</p>

  <p>Upon arriving at that window, Geoffrey pulled Ziya to his side to keep him protected and pushed him in before closely following after.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Soon, the tiny specks of light with a dazzling gleam gathered in one place and transformed into the flesh bodies of Ziya and Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>While viewing it from the outside, the window appeared to be average-sized. It wasn't too large, and not too small. However, upon entering, it soon became clear to them that it was much bigger than what they had initially thought. In fact, it was the entrance to a spacious cave.</p>

  <p>Inside the cave, the atmosphere was a pale misty yellow. It seemed to be some toxic mist.</p>

  <p>Ziya took caution to their surroundings and created a protective space around Geoffrey to keep him from the poisonous mist with a swift wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>After exercising the Space Godly Way successfully, Ziya was lost in his thoughts for a moment before he muttered to himself, "It seems the basic Godly Ways also work here?"</p>

  <p>The three thousand Godly Ways were derived from the Ways-blending Energy, which was also the foundation of the chaos.</p>

  <p>If there was no trace of Ways-blending Energy in this world, the three thousand Godly Ways would refuse to exist. As a result, Ziya would be rendered powerless as he would fail to display the power of any Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"Alright then, let's head inside and take a closer look!"</p>

  <p>The deeper they went into the cave, the more excited Ziya got to explore what lay inside of it. Giving in to his enthusiastic self, Ziya grabbed ahold of Geoffrey's arm and dragged him along to move faster. The next moment, the two of them morphed into individual beams of light that rushed their way into the depths of the cave.</p>

  <p>Initially, Ziya had imagined the cave to be similar to any average cave he had come across. He thought if they rushed through, it wouldn't take long before they would reach the other side. But after hundreds of miles of travel, the space ahead would refuse to meet any end and would just appear to get wider and wider. Moreover, the yellow poisonous mist didn't seem to subside even after coming this far.</p>

  <p>"This world appears to be quite peculiar. Geoffrey, stand firm and maintain a good grip!"</p>

  <p>Just as he exclaimed his instructions, Ziya employed the Grand Teleportation technique and disappeared from the spot he once stood along with Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Using this ability, Ziya was able to cover a great distance of more than ten million miles each time without a hitch.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Ziya and Geoffrey found themselves in another space. This one was much wider than the last, and they weren't even able to locate the surrounding edges due to how spacious it was. In terms of appearance, it resembled the chaos with only one visible exception; the air wasn't decorated with chaotic clouds scattered about, but it had the yellow poisonous mist they had encountered earlier.</p>

  <p>"This place holds a striking resemblance to the chaos, doesn't it?" Geoffrey asked as he looked around to soak in his surroundings.</p>

  <p>He had never seen the chaos with his own eyes before. The only source of information he had was through various descriptions he had heard in the past regarding it.</p>

  <p>"No, not really," Ziya shook his head to disregard Geoffrey's statement and continued, "It's just a larger cave than the one we were previously in. This world is quite strange. It seems to be made up of countless gigantic caves that cease to end. It could be said that this is a world of caves..."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Ziya gripped Geoffrey's hand firmly once more and used the Grand Teleportation technique over and over again.</p>

  <p>Just like the previous times, they teleported to another vast cave, and just like the others, it was desolate with no signs of life anywhere. Except for the constant yellow poisonous mist that followed them everywhere, they never found anything else that appealed to their interests.</p>

  <p>After more than a hundred successive implementations of the Grand Teleportation technique, they entered the vicinity of a new cave.</p>

  <p>However, this time, they finally found something worth a second glance. At the bottom of this cave, there was a layer of huge pits like volcano craters closely packed against each other.</p>

  <p>"Wow! There are so many volcanoes down there?" Geoffrey exclaimed in a high-pitched tone out of overflowing excitement. His eyes gleamed with joy.</p>

  <p>"They aren't volcanoes," Ziya rubbed his chin as he squinted his eyes to look into the distance. "It seems they are lairs of some creatures that live down there."</p>

  <p>Ziya had dragged Geoffrey along a great distance. Geoffrey was only able to comprehend the many caves flashing by his eyes when they teleported, but all this while Ziya had spread his spiritual sense in his surroundings to keep a lookout at all times.</p>

  <p>With his observational skills, he had already found some clues and began to conceptualize a theory about this world.</p>

  <p>In the depths of these huge caves, there were subtle traces of living beings, and even ruins of some simple buildings that had been buried deep underground for a very long time.</p>

  <p>Even the sturdiest of buildings couldn't bear through the erosion of time and collapsed under pressure. After the passing of one or ten billion years, everything would eventually be reduced to nothing but soil.</p>

  <p>However, this place was quite different. Ziya had sensed life force coming from those volcano craters. He instantly pinned them to be living creatures.</p>

  <p>As soon as the two of them made their way to the ground, they noticed a fountain of yellow poisonous mist spurt out uncontrollably from a volcano crater within close proximity. As if on cue, brownish-yellow four-legged snakes slithered their way out of the mist and dashed towards them intending to kill.</p>

  <p>These four-legged snakes appeared to be quite hostile with a malicious aura surrounding them. Their backs were covered in dense yellow poison sacs.</p>

  <p>Their fearful appearance made Geoffrey feel intimidated by them as he subconsciously froze in place.</p>

  <p>With a click of his tongue, Ziya expressed his disappointment as he shook his head and said, "Don't be scared. They're low-level creatures who lack intelligence."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he stretched out a hand and pressed it in the air. Long swords appeared out of nowhere and nailed these four-legged snakes down to the ground, killing them instantly.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe there's no intelligent creatures in this world. We need to keep looking for them!"</p>

  <p>Ziya fell in utter dismay as to what might have happened to this world.</p>

  <p>However, if there existed any Other Shore Realm or Eternal Realm masters, they might have left some traces in this world to vouch for their existence.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Ziya used the Grand Teleportation technique over and over again.</p>

  <p>After countless attempts, Geoffrey suddenly reminded him, "Master Ziya, if the Finale Way also existed in this world and it already failed, then no intelligent creatures would exist after that. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Geoffrey's words, Ziya stopped during the course of his action of using the Grand Teleportation technique and was stunned into silence.</p>

  <p>When every round of chaos came to an end, everything in the world would be eliminated, leaving no traces of lives whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Could it be that this world had been completely destroyed after the Finale Way failed?</p>
