<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The crack sound made the hearts of the crowd in the front tremble violently.</p>

  <p>This Demi-holy Being from the Li Clan was known to be one of the most powerful Demi-holy Beings. He had practiced the Elementary Fire Godly Way, which was able to suppress the chilly air.</p>

  <p>However, the fire prison he built was unable to resist the attack in the slightest.</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>The Demon Ice Sculpture gave out a terrifying roar and chased after the group on the snowfield.</p>

  <p>Everyone was already in panic as they just fled in all directions.</p>

  <p>Just then, Nicholas' voice was heard.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, calm down. This thing is not smart enough. Let's go left!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' voice slipped through everyone's ears carrying a faint gentle mood in it. They were currently being chased and attacked by the Demon Ice Sculpture in such a cold and snowy place, but hearing such a voice gave them a feeling like a spring breeze was kissing them.</p>

  <p>They realized that this was also the trick of the Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>Normally, they would be very disgusted with it. After all, the Great Dominance Technique could bewitch people and no one wanted to be a spiritual slave.</p>

  <p>But using the technique at the moment gave warmth in their hearts. It provided them the strength to pluck up courage. Their hearts already felt at ease from panic.</p>

  <p>The snow falling from the sky was swaying. The snowflakes were so big that they almost blocked the sight in front of the crowd.</p>

  <p>They were instructed to go left and looking ahead, they could faintly see two big snow mountains.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>As they were gradually calmed, they immediately turned around and flew towards the left direction.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>As they fled, another terrible scream was heard from behind. Everyone caught a sight of what happened.</p>

  <p>"He is the Demi-holy Being of the Qin Clan."</p>

  <p>"Leave him alone. Let's go! If we slow down a bit, everyone will die here!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>If it was in a different environment, Nicholas would usually act and think about a solution.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the alliance of the powerful clans, he had to take the lead.</p>

  <p>But the power of the Demon Ice Sculpture was so strange that it was completely beyond his cognition and surpassed their own strength.</p>

  <p>He had also tried to attack the Demon Ice Sculpture, but he couldn't do anything to it just like other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>What he couldn't understand was that no matter what methods they used to attack the opponent, the energy contained within seemed to rapidly weaken and even disappear.</p>

  <p>He could not figure out why.</p>

  <p>The Demon Ice Sculpture didn't seem to have absorbed the energy, so he thought that it was largely attributed to the chilly air.</p>

  <p>However, it was the best choice for them to leave now. He decided and guided everyone to run away immediately.</p>

  <p>He didn't know if he could get rid of the Demon Ice Sculpture, but if they escaped to the snow mountains, he would be able to hinder it for the meantime.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Everyone flew as fast as they could. It was not long before they had apparently reached the side of a snow mountain.</p>

  <p>As soon as they arrived, a consummate True God with sharp eyes shouted,</p>

  <p>"Look! Dead bodies! There are so many dead bodies!"</p>

  <p>"Corpses?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes froze as he heard the statement.</p>

  <p>He turned around and looked closely to where the consummate True God had pointed, and sure it was true.</p>

  <p>Dead bodies were scattered everywhere on the cold ground on the side of the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>They noticed that the corpses wore the same clothes and they died in different gestures.</p>

  <p>All the corpses were covered with a layer of transparent ice, and they were densely packed under the ice, forming a road.</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of so many strange corpses caused everyone to stop.</p>

  <p>"Thump, thump, thump..."</p>

  <p>They heard the footsteps of the Demon Ice Sculpture, which reminded them that it was still chasing after them.</p>

  <p>"That huge ice sculpture is coming up!"</p>

  <p>"Run! Leave these corpses alone!"</p>

  <p>"Wait, it seems that the ice sculpture is unable to enter the snow mountain."</p>

  <p>At a closer look, someone found out that the Demon Ice Sculpture seemed to slow down when it was close to the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>The moment it reached the snow mountain, it began to pace to and fro.</p>

  <p>After it made a few turns, its figure retreated and went back to the snowfield.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Nicholas, breathed a sigh of relief at this scene.</p>

  <p>They didn't know why the Demon Ice Sculpture left and stopped following them but it was undoubtedly the right choice to rush into the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>After a short rest, the crowd turned their eyes once again to the corpses under the ice. The sudden appearance of so many corpses gave them another strange kind of feeling.</p>

  <p>Nicholas descended from the sky and landed on the top of the ice. He scanned the faces of the corpses through the ice.</p>

  <p>After he looked over a number of corpses, a hint of astonishment and hesitation flashed across his eyes.</p>

  <p>"These corpses... They look exactly the same!"</p>

  <p>Observing the change on Nicholas' expression, Clark, Murphy and the rest flew down and gathered around. They took a look and also found the same strange thing.</p>

  <p>The appearances and clothes of the dead bodies were exactly the same.</p>

  <p>The whole ice area along the way was full of this person's corpses. There were probably tens of thousands of corpses.</p>

  <p>"This man looks familiar."</p>

  <p>Murphy stared at the corpses for a long time. Suddenly his eyebrows raised as he said, "Oh, yes. I remember he was from the Luo Clan. He was the junior who cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way."</p>

  <p>Sword Chen didn't stay on the Floating Island for a long time, but he had imprinted a good impression to everyone. He was after all the only one who practiced the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Murphy recognized him since he once had met him.</p>

  <p>"This man cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas asked upon hearing Murphy's words. He suddenly thought of something.</p>

  <p>He was reminded that in the ice palace, someone had saved the woman.</p>

  <p>That person was a Demi-holy Being who cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way. He recalled that his strength was quite impressive.</p>

  <p>The person, who came out of nowhere, might be strong but in the end was killed by the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>They couldn't see anything in the darkness at that time, but with the help of their spiritual senses, they were able to remember all the features of the opponent.</p>

  <p>Nicholas closed his eyes and released his spiritual sense to the ice.</p>

  <p>His spiritual sense swept across the faces of these corpses and confirmed his thoughts. He opened his eyes and said, "He is the Demi-holy Being you killed in the ice palace."</p>

  <p>"But why are there so many corpses?" Clark looked completely puzzled, with an incredible expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Murphy narrowed his eyes and spoke, "There is only one explanation."</p>

  <p>Nicholas looked at him and nodded. "Right. He was cloned. That woman's ability..."</p>

  <p>He then raised his head and looked forward. The corpses spread out all the way, and laid out a path which extended to the top of the snow mountain. It looked weird but appeared magnificent at the same time.</p>

  <p>"What is her purpose in cloning him for so many times?" Zeke who was standing not far away questioned.</p>

  <p>Nicholas shook his head. He thought for a while and said, "Maybe she has the same purpose as us. She wants to get the True Demon Body with the help of these clones."</p>

  <p>"Whatever. Let's go up the mountain first. We can always find the answer,"</p>

  <p>Clark finally uttered and urged.</p>

  <p>The group once again moved and ran towards the snow mountain top along the path formed by the corpses.</p>

  <p>"Thump, thump, thump..."</p>

  <p>The Demon Ice Sculpture, which had been chasing the Holy Beings, returned. Its steps were slow.</p>

  <p>It moved step by step across the snowfield, leaving huge footprints on the thick snow.</p>

  <p>After it went quite a far distance, the center of one of the huge footprints suddenly collapsed, and a black hole appeared.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Figures flew out of the hole one after another.</p>

  <p>The woman floated in the air, looked to the southwest and said, "That group of Holy Beings should start climbing the mountain now. We should speed up!"</p>
