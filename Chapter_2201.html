  <p>
</p>

  <p>A puff of air escaped Luo Zheng's lips. After a careful examination, he still didn't find any clues.</p>

  <p>The consciousness that passed from his inner world was still very strong, but he could no longer determine the direction through his inner world after he entered the cave.</p>

  <p>The only thing he had done was to pull the Great Weighty Sword out from the gangue and place it steadily on the ground.</p>

  <p>The inside of the cave was absolutely silent. It seemed that no living creature had entered it for countless years.</p>

  <p>Anyone who was well-versed in geology and geomancy would be dumbstruck to see such a large cave in the gangue layer.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the whole divine land had a smooth and neat topography.</p>

  <p>Its outermost layer was composed of ordinary soil. Underneath it was a layer of gangue, beneath the gangue was a layer of flint that was a hundred times tougher than the gangue, and below the flint was a layer of soft stone.</p>

  <p>The soft stone was flexible enough that even a top-rank True God would find it hard to break it. Green magma, known as the Lethal Fire Magma flowed under the soft stones. This magma was so dangerous that even if a Holy Being fell into it, they wouldn't be able to escape.</p>

  <p>For so many years, numerous True Gods had explored the forbidden lands while the Holy Beings had seen the chaos outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, no one still knew what exactly was in the core of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred divine eras ago, there had been three Holy Beings who had been in the Lethal Fire Magma. One of them died, and the other two had gotten injured. In the end, they had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>It was because of that reason that many True Gods believed that they were still far from truly understanding the divine land, and the related rumor that had spread throughout the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands wasn't exactly true.</p>

  <p>The gangue layer was considered as the second layer of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Most of the caves in the divine land were on the soft soil. In addition, it was nearly impossible for large caves to be formed on the gangue layer due to the pressure under the soil that had been there for countless divine eras.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slowly moved his Great Weighty Sword across the cave. The tip of the sword emitted a beam of clean light. Since Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find the black thing, he explored the cave first.</p>

  <p>While the sheer size of the cave was astounding, the cave's most striking part was the round stone in its center.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng walked to the side of the round rock, he found that there was something odd when he took closer look. "What the hell is that thing?" he and Master Evil in his mind cried out at the same time.</p>

  <p>On top of the circular stone that was two hundred feet wide, were a man and a woman lying down.</p>

  <p>However, they looked to be in a very strange situation. Their hands and feet seemed to be embedded on the rock, and it looked like they grew out from the stone.</p>

  <p>But that wasn't what made Luo Luo Zheng and Master Evil truly shocked. What was even stranger was that the two people on top of the rock had weird faces and gave off an unsettling Mu Ning. Their faces were formed from several identical faces which had been put together, but despite their oddness, they looked natural. It was as if they were born to be like that.</p>

  <p>The woman had a total of four faces and by human standards, they were all devastatingly beautiful. Each of the faces varied from being happy, sad, angry, and joyful.</p>

  <p>Aside from their faces, their hands and feet were also quite special.</p>

  <p>Lastly, their torsos were embedded deep into the rock.</p>

  <p>"Is there such a race in the divine land?" asked Luo Luo Zheng. It was his first time to see such creatures.</p>

  <p>During Luo Zheng's time in the divine land, he had learned and absorbed all kinds of knowledge he could about the divine land.</p>

  <p>There were undoubtedly many kinds of races in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, there weren't much differences between those races and the human race, especially after the divine citizens managed to become True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely not! They are not living creatures at all... I'm guessing it's a stone statue that has been thrown here," Master Evil answered with certainty.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was someone who was experienced and knowledgeable. He didn't dare say that he understood the entire divine land, but such a strange race living in the stones had completely surpassed his understanding of the word 'creature'. That was why he was so sure.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng scratched his head, as he wasn't so sure.</p>

  <p>But since the special mud had appeared here, it should be related to the people on the stone. The only thing was that he didn't know how to figure out the secret and how they were related.</p>

  <p>"I should look for that thing first..." With a huff, Luo Luo Zheng looked away.</p>

  <p>The two people might have been embedded in the rock for who knew how long, and they themselves seemed to have turned into brown stones.</p>

  <p>Yet when Luo Luo Zheng looked at the woman, he felt that she was also staring at him. It really unnerved him!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng sensed a sudden fluctuation in the space behind him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>"It's here!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, he was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>After all, his purpose in coming to the cave was to find that mysterious mud!</p>

  <p>Linn had once told Luo Luo Zheng that when her uncle had caught that piece of mud, it was black in color and could walk and jump. Therefore, he believed that it was the thing that had launched a surprise attack on him.</p>

  <p>He had been searching for it, but now it actually came out of its own accord!</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Luo Zheng wasted no time and attacked with his sword.</p>

  <p>The flames of the Great Weighty Sword burned hotly. When Luo Luo Zheng struck with it, it released a strong wave of fire.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>The sword slashed at an extremely hard object, and Luo Zheng's arm trembled so bad that he felt it grow numb. The Great Weighty Sword itself definitely wasn't light. Even though the materials in the divine land were generally a lot tougher than the materials in the Evolutionary Universe, he could still use the Great Weighty Sword to cut through the layer of gangue easily.</p>

  <p>However, he had never expected that there was actually something that could block his sword strike.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The moment the Great Weighty Sword bounced back, Luo Zheng's body slid backwards like a ghost. He held the Great Weighty Sword against his chest and cautiously checked his surroundings. Not too far away was a noticeable piece of rock, which turned out to be a gangue!</p>

  <p>"What is going on..."</p>

  <p>As time passed, Luo Luo Zheng got more and more shocked by the turn of events.</p>

  <p>He had already explored the whole cave before he had examined the circular stone. He didn't see the protruding gangue, which meant that it had silently grown behind him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, normal gangue couldn't resist his sword attack, but that gangue was far stronger than normal gangue!</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, this cave has changed. The entrance seems to have disappeared as well..." Master Evil reminded him. Luo Luo Zheng sighed. What Master Evil had said was true.</p>

  <p>His lips curved into a frown as he looked up at the top of the cave.</p>

  <p>His jaw dropped when he saw that the entrance that he had just dug had disappeared!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked more than wary. He had gone to many dangerous places over the years, but he was able to handle them all.</p>

  <p>This cave, however, was beyond his understanding!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Just then, he suddenly felt something move beneath his feet. His eyes flashed and he exerted force on his heels, which caused his whole body to tumble.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Pieces of thin, sharp gangue shot out from the ground like rapidly growing stalagmites. Then, the sharp protrusions tried to pierce him! The toughness of the special gangue was on par with Luo Zheng's Great Weighty Sword. It could even injure a normal True God, let alone a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng surprisingly rolled away quite fast. However, the gangue that protruded from the ground was slightly more powerful!</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the entire cave was densely packed with sharp rocks, just like a monster nest filled with spikes.</p>

  <p>During the entire process, Luo Luo Zheng moved constantly. As soon as he stopped however, a rock flew out from beneath him. In the end, he could only grit his teeth and leap upwards towards the round stone.</p>

  <p>The moment he leapt through the air, many sharp, slender pieces of gangue stretched out for several hundred feet from both the top and bottom of the cave. They were like long snakes that coiled themselves up to bite him.</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Luo Zheng slashed the rapidly growing needles of gangue with his Great Weighty Sword. With the help of the momentum from the attack, he finally got to jump onto the round rock!</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>However, the series of unfortunate events weren't done. Luo Luo Zheng was shocked to discover that just as he stepped on the round stone, the entire cave began to quake.</p>

  <p>There was nothing wrong with his judgment, as no sharp thorns grew on the round stone. However, hundreds of stalagmites grew out from the top of the cave and began to envelope both him and the round stone!</p>
