  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng walked forward and gently tapped on the ice of the black armor. A touch of coldness condensed white frost on his hand.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now? Carry him out like this?" Zheng asked, furrowing his brows.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's strength, it'd be pretty simple to break through this layer of ice.</p>

  <p>The issue now was whether this was the right way to proceed.</p>

  <p>"Master Kincaid hasn't awakened yet; I think you'd better move him out," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord suggested.</p>

  <p>He thought of this out of respect for Kincaid.</p>

  <p>After all, it was the Human Spirit King who was inside the black armor.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>They figured it might be better for Zheng to carry Kincaid out first before they made any rash decisions. Perhaps by then, they could think of a way to wake up Kincaid.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, the ancestry-level bloodline spoke, "Zheng, dismantle the black armor and the sword."</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly stunned. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"The ability of this irregular heavy sword is very similar to mine. I want to explore it..." the ancestry-level bloodline explained.</p>

  <p>The ability of this sword to constantly modify the rules had truly impressed Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for anyone else to leave the infinite space.</p>

  <p>The suggestion of the ancestry-level bloodline was aligned with Zheng's inclinations, but he was still a little hesitant. "Isn't it disrespectful to do that?"</p>

  <p>"Since the Human Spirit Sect has been reduced to such a situation, there is no need to consider if it is respectful or not," the ancestry-level bloodline replied bluntly.</p>

  <p>"That may be true..." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>He bowed to the black armor and said, "I broke in here to save the Human Spirit King. I didn't mean to offend you. Please forgive me if I do!"</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword had proven itself to be intelligent, but Zheng didn't know whether it could understand him or not.</p>

  <p>After saying that, Zheng lightly patted the surface of the ice with his palm.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound rang out.</p>

  <p>Then, hairline cracks appeared inside the originally clear ice, until it collapsed into countless finger-sized ice blocks that fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>If these finger-sized ice blocks were thrown into any of the large provinces of the Source World, they would've launched an ice age over the whole area. Once they melted, an ocean would be formed.</p>

  <p>However, the irregular heavy sword was obviously not willing to give up.</p>

  <p>Although it did not attempt to attack Zheng again, the moment the solid ice broke, it released white light dots, quickly imprisoning it and the black armor in ice once more.</p>

  <p>It seemed determined to struggle till the end.</p>

  <p>Pop...</p>

  <p>Patiently, Zheng broke the ice again.</p>

  <p>Knowing that the irregular heavy sword would freeze itself again, Zheng immediately reached in to grab the sword hilt before it could take action.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a flame cyclone formed in his palm.</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter...</p>

  <p>Under the intense heat of the flame cyclone, the cold air of the irregular heavy sword could not be condensed into ice.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Even then, the sword was still unwilling to give up. It trembled in Zheng's hand and tried to break free, but Zheng clasped it firmly.</p>

  <p>During this whole time, the irregular heavy sword was quietly communicating with Kincaid.</p>

  <p>Kincaid could roughly tell what was happening outside. After sensing the unwillingness of the irregular heavy sword, he advised, "You've already lost. According to the rule, he's your master, as I also became your master in this way back then."</p>

  <p>The sword and the armor made of the Life Iron had been found and obtained by Kincaid and Sheehan in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>When he met it for the first time, Kincaid used all kinds of methods to subdue it.</p>

  <p>After years of companionship, he and the sword grew to become comrades in arms.</p>

  <p>"What? You say you didn't have a master at that time, but now your master is me?"</p>

  <p>Kincaid once again felt a strong emotion from the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>He shook his head and sighed. "According to the standards of the main world, I'm already dead. Now I can't even wake up. How can I be your master?</p>

  <p>The most important thing is that he is not our enemy. He has come to save me.</p>

  <p>I believe in this human being!</p>

  <p>He is the extension of our human spirits. Please respect my judgment. You can trust him..."</p>

  <p>Kincaid urged.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter was that Kincaid might have had some doubts about Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng standing before him was probably his only hope. He had to trust him. Otherwise, he would probably be trapped there forever.</p>

  <p>Finally convinced, the irregular heavy sword stopped trembling.</p>

  <p>Zheng gripped the hilt of the sword and pointed it upward.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The cracks on the blade emitted rays of red light, and a strange emotion that resembled longing was transmitted to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed that it was hungry and thirsty, and it needed energy.</p>

  <p>At first, he didn't know how to respond, but the ancestry-level bloodline also sensed its hunger. Immense energy like sea water surged into Zheng's arm and flowed into the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword did not even try to repel the energy given by the ancestry-level bloodline. In fact, it seemed to lap it up ravenously.</p>

  <p>"Is this sword born for you?" Zheng said jokingly.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline said, "I don't know, but I must have some sort of connection with it..."</p>

  <p>After the irregular heavy sword's hunger was satiated, it let out a soft buzzing noise. Then, the black armor began to disintegrate.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>Helmet, breastplate, shoulder pads...</p>

  <p>The pieces of broken black armor suddenly flew towards Zheng. In the blink of an eye, Zheng found himself neatly covered in the black armor.</p>

  <p>"This armor..."</p>

  <p>While Zheng was still caught in surprise, it vaguely registered on him that a Treacherous Being was standing in the exact same place the black armor had just been. This Treacherous Being was tall and strong, bearing a handsome face. A wild and keen aura emanated from him. This was the Human Spirit King, Kincaid.</p>

  <p>On the chest of Kincaid, there were two golden crosses floating. They were his coordinates.</p>

  <p>"What type of Treacherous Being is Kincaid's body?" Zheng asked aloud.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord replied, "He is neither of the killing type nor the friendly type. The kind of Treacherous Being which remains motionless belongs to the sleeping type."</p>

  <p>After all, it wasn't Kincaid that had attacked Zheng, but his sword.</p>

  <p>"Then I..."</p>

  <p>Zheng wanted to ask how to deal with the Treacherous Being, but before the words could leave his lips, a rumble suddenly came from above. The entire altar had begun to shake!</p>

  <p>'They can't hold on any longer.'</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows raised slightly, anxiety suddenly welling up within him.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Snake Spirit King would definitely attack the altar, but he had trusted that the combined power of the human spirits, the monkey spirits and the bird spirits was enough to resist for a period of time.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng swiftly took out his Sumeru Space and tossed the Human Spirit King's Treacherous Being body and coordinates into it. Then, he spared no time and quickly left the stone hall.</p>

  <p>When Zheng pushed the door open, the old man guarding the ice hall jerked his head up.</p>

  <p>The old man's obsession was Kincaid, after all. Naturally, he cared about everything that took place within the stone hall.</p>

  <p>When the old man saw the heavy black armor push the door open and come out, he froze in place for a few moments. His originally dull eyes suddenly flashed with life. He thought that Kincaid had awakened, and his obsession was instantly satisfied, so he suddenly woke up.</p>

  <p>"Master Kincaid!"</p>

  <p>The old man strode to Zheng excitedly and knelt down on one knee before him.</p>

  <p>"You... You have woken up?" Zheng, stunned, embarrassedly explained, "I'm not Kincaid."</p>

  <p>The old man slowly stood up and looked at him with confusion. "It's you," he cried as it dawned on him. "You are that human being! You defeated Master Kincaid? He hasn't woken up?"</p>

  <p>"No, his Treacherous Being body has been stored into my Sumeru Space,"</p>

  <p>Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Why?" the old man demanded, unable to contain his excitement.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand. "The Snake Spirit King is attacking outside the altar.</p>

  <p>I need to deal with that first."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zheng headed straight to the gate without another word.</p>

  <p>The old man stood there in a daze for a moment, watching Zheng's receding figure. Suddenly, he realized that Kincaid had been taken away by this human, so he hurriedly chased after him.</p>
