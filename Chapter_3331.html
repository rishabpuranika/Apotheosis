  <p>The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and other races eyed each other up from all directions to find that they were not injured by the strike!</p>

  <p>Although the light gave off an intimidating vibe, it lacked the required potential to cause significant harm.</p>

  <p>In a state of confusion, Feng Ge stared hard at her palms to make sense of the situation.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the Dark Region!" Luo Zheng reminded her with a morose expression etched across his face.</p>

  <p>The light released by Feng Ge was a form of energy. Instead of harming the creatures of the Light Region, it was aimed at the Dark Region. As a result, the beings of the Light Region remained unharmed.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, when Feng Ge unleashed her light, Ling Shuang and the Dark Region were unlucky enough to be caught in the crossfire.</p>

  <p>The light made its way behind Feng Ge and caused a mountain in the Dark Region to be reduced to dust. Even though Ling Shuang was under the protection of the light, the mountain below her feet crumpled to the ground and caused her to fall.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the beam of light quickly responded to her predicament. It enveloped her vertically and protected her.</p>

  <p>"Is this woman serious, or is she joking with us?"</p>

  <p>"Does she really believe she could kill people with her insignificant light?</p>

  <p>It's laughable."</p>

  <p>"Such a waste of a pretty face. She's practically brainless?"</p>

  <p>Once they realized Feng Ge's attack was powerless against them, they regained their lost vitality and began to taunt her.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to give Luo Zheng enough time to concoct a strategy, Ajay and the others attempted to launch another attack towards him.</p>

  <p>Overhearing all the mockery directed to her, Feng Ge tilted her head and asked indifferently, "Brainless?"</p>

  <p>As she said this, she made her way towards Luo Zheng with a dark shadow hovering over her face. When she was only a few feet away from him, she gently tapped her snow-white feet on the ground. As a result, the ground was unable to withstand her strength and cracked under pressure. At the same time, the speed at which she flew in his direction increased considerably!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>She became so agile that it was difficult for anyone to read her movements.</p>

  <p>Within a split second, she had caught up with the members of the Golden Body race. In an infuriated state, she reached out her hand and grabbed ahold of one of them.</p>

  <p>The adrenaline rushed through the body of the Golden Body member due to the stimulation of his Golden Battle Bone, which made him launch numerous frantic attacks at Luo Zheng. Suddenly, he felt a bone-chilling touch on his shoulder. As he turned to look, he saw it was Feng Ge's hand.</p>

  <p>Before he could react, he felt a frightening force coming from her hand. It was so powerful that he couldn't resist it with his Golden Battle Bone. He began to lose consciousness and was directly thrown into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Light Region were restricted to enter the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Even though the Golden Body race were proud owners of insanely durable bodies, they would still perish in an instant when exposed to the darkness.</p>

  <p>As a result, his hair, bones, and flesh were devoured completely. They manifested themselves into mere black smoke. The only thing that remained to vouch for his existence was the Golden Battle Bone.</p>

  <p>Although the Golden Battle Bone was not to be underestimated, it was only a matter of time before it would perish as well. The Golden Battle Bone deteriorated at a slower rate compared to other items. At first, the surface of the bone would turn a charred-black color, and then it would develop bumps across it and break down into pieces. And lastly, the many small pieces of bone would be destroyed and disappear in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge continued her ruthless actions, more and more members of the Golden Body race were thrown off into the Dark Region. Each of them faded away quickly and became a distant memory.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was not as forgiving as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since she was slow to reinforce, Luo Zheng was under siege the entire time. When the sudden realization hit her that these people intended to kill Luo Zheng, she was engulfed with fury raging in every fiber of her being. Her only goal was to annihilate all the guys who flashed a golden light.</p>

  <p>"The guys from the Golden Body race have such low resistance!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that's the case. This woman is just too strong for them!"</p>

  <p>"Damn, this woman is really in a league of her own?"</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the Bearing race were left dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Initially, they were amused by Feng Ge's tenacity to retaliate. However, they never expected her to come out with such formidable strength.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, she had tossed six members of the Golden Body race into the Dark Region. Only Ajay remained.</p>

  <p>The moment the Golden Battle Bone was pierced through Ajay's flesh, he would only have five minutes before he breathed his last. In the last few moments of his life, he seemed rather calm.</p>

  <p>The strength of the human woman that came out of the Dark Region was too overwhelming. Ajay knew there was nothing more he could do, except to accept his defeat. Even if he risked his life, he would still fall short of completing his task.</p>

  <p>"Stop. I'll do it myself!" Ajay stared Feng Ge in the eye and gestured her to halt her attacks.</p>

  <p>The members of the Golden Body race held the Golden Battle Bone with high regard. For so many years, they had only lost one.</p>

  <p>However, when Feng Ge tossed six of their members into the Dark Region, their Golden Battle Bones could not be retrieved. As a result, they had suffered a loss of six bones in one fell swoop. All members of the Golden Body race fell into a crippling depression. They valued the Golden Battle Bone more than their own lives.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge glared at Ajay with blood-shot eyes as she yanked Luo Zheng behind her.</p>

  <p>It was as if she was a hawk protecting a chick.</p>

  <p>After Ajay walked over to the edge of the Dark Region, he pulled out the Golden Battle Bone from his body. Then with a swift move, he threw it towards the members of the Golden Body race.</p>

  <p>When the Golden Battle Bone was inserted into his body, it fed off of his life force and became a part of him. If it were to be pulled out, he would instantly die. When he disposed of the bone from his body, he had used up all his leftover energy. As a result, he fell backward lifelessly and got consumed by the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Where is Ling Shuang?" Luo Zheng glanced in Feng Ge's direction and asked.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had no concern attached to Ling Shuang's life. Since Luo Zheng was the one who inquired about it, she replied in a casual tone, "Don't worry. She's still breathing."</p>

  <p>After she finished her words, Feng Ge went into the Dark Region to draw Ling Shuang out.</p>

  <p>Ajay had fallen, and the remaining members of the Golden Body race had given up on the thought of confronting them. With careful hands, they picked up the last surviving Golden Battle Bone and retreated.</p>

  <p>"It looks like you haven't learned your lesson after the last time I destroyed the temple of the Bearing race," Luo Zheng said with a sullen voice. "Do you want me to go back and destroy your temple once more? Which temple should it be this time... Should it be the Bearing race's, the Divine Farmer race's, or the Jin Wu's? What do you think about that?"</p>

  <p>Initially, when Luo Zheng had stayed in Stage Four, he had planned to tear down the temple of the Divine Farmer race. But then he let them go. However, if he were to return to Stage Four, destroying two temples at a time wouldn't pose much of a challenge for him.</p>

  <p>The location of the temple of the Jin Wu was still unknown. But he was convinced he would find it in Stage Four.</p>

  <p>Those Souls of Light could retreat from the Other Shore at will. They were in no hurry to run away just yet. After hearing Luo Zheng's threat, the Souls of Light shook with fear.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng destroyed the temple of the Bearing race last time, they had suffered an incalculable loss.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Bearing race were given strict orders to kill Luo Zheng at first sight in Stage Thirteen. Even so, they secretly hoped they didn't get a chance to encounter him. They had pinned their hopes on Luo Zheng leaving the Lust World, upon passing Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>As long as Luo Zheng stayed in the Lust World, the Bearing race would not be able to turn the tables in their favor.</p>

  <p>"Humph! If you even think of touching our temple, we will tear down the Taiyi Heaven Palace." A man from the Bearing race mustered up the courage to throw the threat back at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes! If the Taiyi Heaven Palace were destroyed, your life would become the living example of a stray dog!" a member of the Jin Wu said.</p>

  <p>"You can only act as tough as you do on the Other Shore," a man from the Divine Farmer race uttered.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace had never pronounced Luo Zheng officially as their disciple. They also expressed their unfamiliarity with him on many occasions.</p>

  <p>However, all of this had proven the fact that the relationship between Luo Zheng and the Taiyi Heaven Palace was special.</p>

  <p>If the situation were to get out of hand, the Bearing race would attack the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"None of you gets to decide when the Bearing race would attack the Taiyi Heaven Palace." As Luo Zheng spoke, he shook his head disapprovingly. He tossed a stone upwards with his toe and reached out to catch it. With a gentle force, he crushed it into minuscule particles in front of them. "So don't talk nonsense right at my face. Now, get out of here before I change my mind."</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's strength, if he were to throw these particles at the Souls of Light, he could crush them in an instant.</p>

  <p>Witnessing a tiny spectacle of Luo Zheng's power, the Souls of Light were stunned. They didn't dare stay a minute longer and rushed away all at once after reciting the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>
