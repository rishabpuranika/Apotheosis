<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3143 That's Him </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every disciple of the Flow Sword Sect present held their breath as their pupils dilated at this sight.</p>

  <p>It was as if the cat got their tongues. None of them uttered a word, not even the servant girls. Instead, they all stared at the golden speck of light.</p>

  <p>Just how talented was he to reach the sixth floor on his first attempt?</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>Excited, they had tears in their eyes. It made them look so radiant.</p>

  <p>Milo was watching intently as his face shifted. The expression of the girl standing next to him also switched.</p>

  <p>"He's so obsessed with cultivation, yet he can still make it to the sixth floor.</p>

  <p>If I'm not wrong, then just like you, this man began with the Emotion Closing Godly Way," Kate whispered to Milo as she kept her gaze fixated on the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. I've heard that if one can control themselves with the Soul Controlling Godly Way, they could also resist the Flame of Soul," Milo said curtly.</p>

  <p>The Soul Controlling Godly Way was known as the Great Dominance Technique in the divine land.</p>

  <p>To explain further, the users of the theurgy beyond the Soul Controlling Godly Way could create another consciousness. And thus, they were able to control themselves in mysterious ways.</p>

  <p>"Although he seems promising, I'm afraid it's tough for him to break the record set by you," Kate said as the corners of her mouth curved into a smile.</p>

  <p>The spectacle of the man in the tower was stupefying. However, Milo still had the upper hand since he had jumped to the eighth floor when he first entered the tower.</p>

  <p>Both Milo and Kate were convinced that Zheng was not up to par with Milo, at least not yet.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Kate's voice fell, Zheng had rushed to the seventh floor!</p>

  <p>The sixth and seventh floors posed as the most intricate barriers for the disciples. They would end up getting trapped in there in most cases.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Flow Sword Sect kept the ones who reached the seventh floor in high regard compared to others.</p>

  <p>Just when they began doubting whether Zheng would advance any further, he had already reached the seventh floor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Flow Tower, the Flame of Soul had turned into a shrieking blood-red color.</p>

  <p>The higher he moved, the more the Flame of Soul intensified.</p>

  <p>Even if he used the Emotion Closing Godly Way, it would still prove insufficient in trying to completely get rid of the negative emotions that sprouted like an unwanted weed.</p>

  <p>But he still retained his feet steady and held on.</p>

  <p>By this moment, Zheng had lost track of time and the count of the floor he was on.</p>

  <p>He only knew one thing: he had to keep moving forward till his legs gave up on him. If he even faced the slightest hesitation, those messy emotions would take over his heart and throw him into the abyss of pain.</p>

  <p>This kind of pain was unique. It was directed towards neither the soul nor flesh, but towards the heart!</p>

  <p>"I must keep going!"</p>

  <p>Zheng roared in frustration and jumped up again.</p>

  <p>"He has reached the eighth floor,"</p>

  <p>Kate said, her throat now dry as she glanced at Milo.</p>

  <p>Milo refused to break his silence, but she still sensed the caution reflecting through his eyes.</p>

  <p>The guy who was able to ascend to the eighth floor in his first attempt at the Flow Tower was qualified to be Milo's opponent. Kate began to wonder who he was.</p>

  <p>If he was from the mountain, he couldn't be a nobody.</p>

  <p>Was he some sort of secret prodigy that was directly sent to the Flow Sword Sect?</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>The long-reigning silence was finally broken when Zheng reached the eighth floor.</p>

  <p>Previously when Zheng made it to the fifth and sixth floors, everyone was shocked. But, they still questioned whether his cultivation was sufficient enough for him to go further. Damien and Imran even went as far as to think Zheng was on the same level as them.</p>

  <p>However, as Zheng went on to reach the seventh and eighth floors, they subconsciously hung their heads in defeat, thinking they were inferior to him.</p>

  <p>Such a fellow was far more powerful than the likes of them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, at this moment, most people changed their minds. They were all eager to know which floor this guy would mark as his last.</p>

  <p>"Can he reach the ninth floor?"</p>

  <p>"He has already tied with Milo's record."</p>

  <p>"If he manages to break Milo's record, it will be much more interesting!"</p>

  <p>Many curious heads turned to Milo to study his posture about the situation.</p>

  <p>They wanted to know what he was thinking.</p>

  <p>For them, it was a pipe dream to get on the same level as Milo. Therefore, they had hoped someone else could finally surpass him instead.</p>

  <p>But Milo remained calm and composed. He kept his gaze fixed at the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, the golden speck of light that had everyone's attention began to move again. It had jumped up and conquered the ninth floor as well!</p>

  <p>"This is a new record!" the glamorous woman exclaimed with excitement.</p>

  <p>Zheng had made her eat her previous words to such a degree that she began to doubt the assessment system of the Flow Sword Sect. It had given him a 'Poor' evaluation twice in a row, but his performance as of now was beyond anyone's expectation. Was the Flow Tower broken again? No, it couldn't be.</p>

  <p>It had just gotten repaired.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the golden light dot didn't seem to halt its movement after reaching the ninth floor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the Flow Tower, Zheng began to feel his body refuse the urge to go any further. It had reached its limit.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way was not omnipotent, even though it was the best way to resist the Flame of Soul.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's obsession was so strong that he was flooding with negative emotions welling up inside. They were like tentacles coiling around his entire body with a strenuous grip. The moment he moved up, the pressure of the Flame of Soul on the tenth floor doubled once again.</p>

  <p>After he reached the seventh floor, the Flame of Fire seemed to have acquired a strange ability that could make him have illusions.</p>

  <p>The illusions seemed so surreal that Zheng was unable to tell whether they were fake or not.</p>

  <p>Time passed by slowly in the tower. A second felt like several months for him.</p>

  <p>During this time, he had seen so many dreadful illusions of the divine land being destroyed by an invisible dark hand, the tragic death of Geoffrey and Yudie, and the shattering of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Even if he figured out what he saw was not real, he still couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling from his mind. The magic was so strong that he felt pain from all those scenarios in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Holy shit! Chop!"</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that if he persisted for a little longer, he would sink into these wild illusions forever.</p>

  <p>With every fiber of his leftover spiritual power, he clenched his teeth and rushed to the tenth floor, knocking down the door of the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The door to the tenth floor was smashed open, and a man drenched in his own sweat collapsed right in front of it.</p>

  <p>Zheng was drained from all his energy, and his skin was soaked as if he just came out of the water.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he left the Flow Tower, the Flame of Soul diminished into thin air. Everything went back to normal as he fell to his knees, exhausted. His eyes that once reflected fear and regret were now clear of all emotions.</p>

  <p>As if alerted by the door being opened, Milo and Kate desperately glanced in the direction of the man to make out his identity.</p>

  <p>When their eyes fell on the figure of interest, they were shocked to their very cores.</p>

  <p>"Milo, that's him!"</p>

  <p>Kate covered her mouth subconsciously as she gasped at the sight of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of all people, she should have been aware of his whereabouts. After all, she spent a lot of her time investigating Zheng's background.</p>

  <p>It was not normal for a cultivator in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm to defeat Fergus. However, Zheng had disappeared for some time inexplicably after Milo had shamed him by cutting off his sword.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that Zheng would climb up the mountain in such a short period and join the Flow Sword Sect?</p>
