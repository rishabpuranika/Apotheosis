<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Wind blew through Xun's gossamer hair as she ran to Zheng at an extremely fast speed. When she was finally a meter away from him, she flung her slender and delicate body against his muscular chest quite hard that it pushed him out of the training tower.</p>

  <p>The impact of their collision even threw off Yudie's hand that grasped his arm.</p>

  <p>At that moment, everyone looked at them with varying expressions.</p>

  <p>For instance, Aura covered her mouth in surprise at Xun's openness.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's jaws dropped as he stared blankly at the scene outside the door.</p>

  <p>And Yudie frowned deeply before looking fully angry. She quickly went into the training tower and slammed the door with a bang. Then, she turned to Geoffrey and shouted, "What are you looking at! It's not a sight a child should see!"</p>

  <p>"It just happened right before my eyes! I cannot choose not to look at it!" refuted Geoffrey as he pursed his lips. "What's more, I'm already sixteen years old..."</p>

  <p>The young Geoffrey had grown up in the Cloud Hall, where he had a few playmates during his childhood.</p>

  <p>Later on, Zheng had been worried about his families' safety, so he took Geoffrey in to the fairy palace, where the young boy's life had changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>Although he kept himself busy with deciphering the Sanskrit words and practicing the spear, he was still young and energetic, especially when he reached the age of puberty when his blood ran hot often. He was curious about everything in the world and hoped to take a trip outside the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>He had mentioned it to his mother several times, but Yudie rejected him with the excuse that he was too young.</p>

  <p>In reality, Geoffrey couldn't leave the fairy palace as their living conditions didn't allow it.</p>

  <p>If the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace was opened, all of them would have to hide in the training tower. Otherwise, they would break into life vitality and disappear in this world.</p>

  <p>That was the secondary creatures' limitation. It was impossible to get rid of it if one did not have powerful theurgies. Even Zheng still had to comprehend Godly Ways to secretly enter the divine land. And so, there was no way that Geoffrey could go to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Moreover, returning to the Evolutionary Universe definitely wasn't easy.</p>

  <p>Now that the fairy palace's transmission node was tied to Zheng's mountain token, if they wanted to enter the Evolutionary Universe, they had to go over a vast distance and find the entrance to the Evolutionary Universe themselves before they could enter it.</p>

  <p>That was why the moment Yudie and the others entered the fairy palace was equivalent to them setting foot on an isolated island. If they left the lone island, none of them would be able to survive.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night didn't have so much etiquette as the humans did, so Xun wasn't as reserved as most human women.</p>

  <p>She missed Zheng, so she expressed her feelings to him in her own way.</p>

  <p>For example, she hugged him unabashedly and now they were like a pair of entangled octopuses. Yet, she didn't care about the others staring.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Aura's and Freya's cheeks were the color of beets, and they immediately looked away.</p>

  <p>"Clank! Clank! Clank..."</p>

  <p>Livingston, who always stayed in the weapon refining workshop, strangely left the weapon refining workshop today. The light on his metal head flashed when he sensed that Zheng had returned to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>He wanted to talk to Zheng, but when he saw the scene, he quietly retreated back to the weapon refining workshop.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Imogen, who stood not far away, was as livid as Yudie when she saw the pair in a very close position. "No matter how much she misses him, she shouldn't have behaved like that in the broad daylight.</p>

  <p>This is too preposterous!" she muttered.</p>

  <p>"I don't want this body anymore," Xun whispered in Zheng's ear and tightly grabbed his arm.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned for a moment, then he understood what Xun meant. He slowly sat up, held her in his arms, and smiled. "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"This body is a nuisance to me. I don't want it anymore," Xun complained.</p>

  <p>In the past, Xun had been attached to Zheng's body in the form of a remnant soul in his sword spirit. Since she had been with him for so long, she too had experienced numerous hardships and challenges.</p>

  <p>The first time she had separated from him was hard for her as she wasn't used to it; but this time she had been away from him for so long…</p>

  <p>She had worked so hard just to get the chance to enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>She had been cultivating in the training tower like mad for the past two years so she could get an opportunity.</p>

  <p>Her cultivation was at the level of a world lord, and the martial arts she mainly cultivated were about killing. She wanted to master Murdering Godly Way with her own comprehension.</p>

  <p>She however, lacked some of the preliminary requirements, so it was quite hard for her to step into her desired Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, she still couldn't leave the fairy palace even if she really condensed her Godly Tile. The Ruling Slate would've punished her if she ever left, because she was only a secondary creature.</p>

  <p>It was hard for Xun to accept her situation.</p>

  <p>"How can it be a nuisance, you silly girl?" Zheng gently flicked Xun's forehead with his finger.</p>

  <p>Xun's demonic red eyes looked serious as she said, "It's meaningful only when I stay with you. A soul is enough for me. I have to find a way to get rid of my physical body!"</p>

  <p>The girl didn't seem to be lying, but Zheng quickly said, "No, you can't do that. More importantly, you'll still be a secondary creature even if you only have your soul left. Even if you hide in my body, I'm afraid you will still break apart..."</p>

  <p>"Then you teach me a Godly Way so that I can enter the divine land and keep you company. Or, what if you never leave again, just stay in the fairy palace..." Her mind was simple and she blurted out whatever was inside it, just like a child.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw her innocent face, his body surged with want and he suddenly felt impulsive.</p>

  <p>Then again, he could restrain his desires because he had a strong state of mind. But since he had now finally returned to the fairy palace, he had completely relaxed himself.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, they were in broad daylight and they weren't the only people in the fairy palace. They still had to behave properly.</p>

  <p>For the next few days, Joy didn't leave the side hall and kept comprehending the Truth of Godly Way that Geoffrey had decoded.</p>

  <p>It might take a mere split second, years, or even several divine eras for a Demi-holy Being to comprehend something. Such a thing was quite common. In addition, Zheng also told everyone not to disturb her.</p>

  <p>He as well, was quite interested in the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, he just came back so he wasn't in a hurry. Besides, it wouldn't be a problem if he asked Geoffrey to write another one for him.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, Zheng lived his life to the fullest. He guided Geoffrey in practicing martial arts every morning, and whenever the younger boy had questions, he patiently answered them. On top of that, Geoffrey had also showed him some of the contents of the Golden Sanskrit words that he had deciphered over the past few years.</p>

  <p>The contents of those golden Sanskrit words were about all kinds of strange things. The most valuable one among them was undoubtedly the complete passage about the Truth of Godly Way. The contents in other passages gave Zheng a general idea of extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>Before, it was virtually impossible to imagine what the extraordinary creatures were like. There was no way for anyone to hypothesize about their shapes or state of existence.</p>

  <p>Yet according to the contents of the Golden Sanskrit words, he discovered that those extraordinary creatures were not as mysterious as he had imagined. There were halls and complex social relationships in their world. They would also die; there were also powerful warriors among them, and they also revered those who were more powerful than them.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey and Zheng also exchanged ideas and discoursed. Although the young boy didn't have a high cultivation level yet, he had gained plenty of knowledge from the library. He was broad-minded and intelligent. It was even likely that many True Gods who had lived for so many divine eras couldn't compare to him in that regard.</p>

  <p>And at night, Zheng spent his time wonderfully with his wives and enjoyed the land of warmth and tenderness.</p>

  <p>On the first day, he had offended Yudie, and she didn't talk to him for a full day. She was full of jealousy, and it took him a long time to make her laugh through tears.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, things brewed differently in the east of the divine land. dozens of people dressed in jet black cloaks swiftly moved forward across the endless desert.</p>

  <p>It turned out that all those cloaked beings were mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>The one at the helm had a long sword that hung from his back. He was tall and moved in a steady pace.</p>

  <p>Under his lead, the group of True Gods soon found a crater that was over ten million feet deep in the desert.</p>

  <p>One by one, the True Gods in black cloaks slid down the crater. After all of them were in, they were surprised to see where they ended up.</p>

  <p>"It's the Jade Bone Divine City."</p>

  <p>"The entire Jade Bone Divine City had been destroyed. What on earth has happened?"</p>

  <p>The leader of their group stepped forward and lifted his cloak's hood to reveal a heroic-looking face. He glanced indifferently at the ruins in front of him and coldly ordered, "Let's find the slate first."</p>

  <p>Then, he took the lead and went forward.</p>
