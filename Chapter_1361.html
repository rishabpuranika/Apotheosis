<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1361 Who Has The Final Say </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Yolande's face when she heard these words. Her confidence in Luo Luo Zheng, however, was strong.</p>

  <p>She didn't know how many petals Luo Zheng's Lotus Flower had sprouted, nor did she receive any such related memories from her two clones. Luo Luo Zheng had gone through the Heavenly Tribulation while he had been on the Divine Kingdom Continent. One of her two clones had then been in the Eastern Region, while the other on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>She did not ask Luo Luo Zheng about it. Since he already had obtained the golden title of Celestial Position in the Tower of Sin, it would be comical if he could not even pass the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng maintained his normal speed as he slowly flew toward the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>Those who had failed were all standing below. Curious as to whether or not Luo Luo Zheng would pass the Red Cloud Ring, everyone had their attention on him.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's speed was slow, the height of the Red Cloud Ring was only about two to three hundred feet. In a short while, he arrived before the ring.</p>

  <p>The Red Cloud Ring in its normal state was like a red-hot iron ring, showing streaks of dark red light.</p>

  <p>Under the gaze of everyone present, Luo Luo Zheng quietly headed in the direction of the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>It was clear to see that the Red Cloud Ring did not produce the transparent membrane to block Luo Luo Zheng. Furthermore, the moment he passed through, the Red Cloud Ring seemed to sense something. A streak of scarlet light began to accumulate on the ring.</p>

  <p>"The momentum of the light is so fierce. It seems to surpass Layla's light."</p>

  <p>"That can't be possible. The light the Red Cloud Ring released when Layla passed through probably reached the ring's limit. How could that be surpassed?"</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and have a look first. There will always be a superior!"</p>

  <p>In the air above the Red Cloud Ring, Layla bit her lips and stared intently at the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>Why was it that she considered Luo Luo Zheng her opponent?</p>

  <p>The reason was definitely not because he took away her master's Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>However, that day, her master had told her in secret that Luo Luo Zheng had the same fate as her? the fate to lead the world of chaos. Moreover, there seemed to be some uncertainty about Luo Zheng's fate, which meant that no one could tell for certain how his future would turn out.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was qualified to be her opponent.</p>

  <p>Layla did not take the talents of Mist Palace seriously at all. For instance, although Javier was a powerful and talented warrior, she thought he was no match for her.</p>

  <p>As such, ever since she had entered Mist Palace, she could have lived in a secluded place to cultivate without any disturbance. However, she had chosen the small palace in Ice Cloud House to become Luo Zheng's neighbor on purpose.</p>

  <p>After issuing the challenge through the Tiger Roar Token, Layla had hoped that Luo Luo Zheng would challenge her. However, he did not care at all and casually ignored her.</p>

  <p>She had provoked him multiple times and even demolished his house, but he still chose to disregard her.</p>

  <p>In the end, Layla had no options left. She could not possibly attack Luo Luo Zheng without a proper reason.</p>

  <p>Although the most crucial part of the test was Passing the Torch, she could also have an idea of Luo Zheng's talent from the reaction of the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>Seeing the light accumulated on the Red Cloud Ring become brighter and brighter than before, Layla became nervous. With her proud nature, she was certain that there were not many talents in the universe who could compare with her, and in the thirteen palaces, there were even fewer of them.</p>

  <p>The light on the Red Cloud Ring continued to gather, about to surge through with brilliance.</p>

  <p>Yolande watched the scene unfold. A look of disbelief was evident in her eyes. As for Timothy, the vice leader, he pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>However, suddenly, the light accumulated by the Red Cloud Ring disappeared. The bright light disappeared, but that was not important.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the Red Cloud Ring remained lit with a dark red color. However, at this moment, the dark red light also disappeared, making the entire Red Cloud Ring turn into a black-colored iron ring.</p>

  <p>When the crowd saw this scene, they were stunned.</p>

  <p>"How could this be?"</p>

  <p>"Could it be that the Red Cloud Ring gave out?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? The Red Cloud Ring is a first-rank divine weapon, after all. It's not like it has been damaged by an attack, so it's impossible for it to come to an end just like that!"</p>

  <p>Whether it was the warriors in the sky or the ones below, everyone was discussing among themselves.</p>

  <p>As a treasure of Mist Palace used to screen talents, the Red Cloud Ring had never before been damaged.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just passed through the Red Cloud Ring when he saw what happened. 'What is going on?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Layla heaved a long sigh of relief. She did not think that the Red Cloud Ring would prove anything. This was just a small screening conducted by Mist Palace before Passing the Torch. Even if Luo Luo Zheng was able to make the Red Cloud Ring release a stronger light, it did not mean that his talent was better than hers.</p>

  <p>Layla did not wish for Luo Luo Zheng to surpass her when it came to the Red Cloud Ring. As she had watched the light brewing on the Red Cloud Ring grow larger, she had grown worried. Now that the Red Cloud Ring gave out, she was once again at ease.</p>

  <p>Yolande gently floated toward the Red Cloud Ring, her expression growing grave. She glanced at Luo Luo Zheng listlessly before reaching out to touch the Red Cloud Ring. As her finger gently touched it, the ring was activated and it once again released a red light.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Luo Luo Zheng asked out aloud.</p>

  <p>Yolande stared at Luo Luo Zheng, the corners of her mouth slightly lifted. "Why don't you try again?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and went round the Red Cloud Ring, following Yolande's instructions. He again went up from below.</p>

  <p>In the end, it yielded the same result as last time.</p>

  <p>The red glow on the Red Cloud Ring extinguished after having been restored for a while. Then the ring turned black and lost its luster.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Yolande blinked. She waved her fingers at him and said, "All right. You've passed."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, no longer bothered by the strange occurrence. He flew up into the air and stood side by side with the other warriors who had passed through the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Timothy said, "Miss, isn't doing this against the rules? According to the rules, if one wants to participate in Passing the Torch, they have to go through the selection process of the Red Cloud Ring. Luo Luo Zheng hasn't passed it."</p>

  <p>Yolande said coldly, "He has already passed the Red Cloud Ring."</p>

  <p>"But there's a problem with the Red Cloud Ring!" Timothy argued with reason.</p>

  <p>"He still passed the ring," Yolande replied, maintaining her stance.</p>

  <p>Timothy let out a cold laugh. "So you're saying that if one doesn't activate the Red Cloud Ring, he still passes? Doesn't that mean that everyone else can pass the test and take part in Passing the Torch? If so, what is the point in passing the Red Cloud Ring? If this rascal is allowed to pass, wouldn't it be unfair to the other warriors?"</p>

  <p>In fact, as long as one was not blind, one could clearly see that the Red Cloud Ring extinguished only after Luo Luo Zheng had crossed it.</p>

  <p>However, Timothy's words triggered the anger of the warriors below who hadn't passed the test.</p>

  <p>Only less than ten percent of the warriors had passed through the Red Cloud Ring. The other ninety percent would not be able to participate in Passing the Torch. Obviously, they were disappointed and unhappy.</p>

  <p>When they heard Timothy's words, they joined in as well.</p>

  <p>"That's right. If you let him pass, shouldn't everyone else be able to pass as well?"</p>

  <p>"You have to make him pass it again. Or else it is fraud!"</p>

  <p>They shouted out aloud.</p>

  <p>Hearing the voices of the warriors below, Yolande was furious. Her eyes became cold as ice.</p>

  <p>She had already guessed what the problem was, but she didn't want to say it. Just now, when Luo Luo Zheng had passed through the Red Cloud Ring for the first time and the light extinguished, she had figured out what happened? he had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>The Red Cloud Ring could only sense the Hinayana Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>Beyond this, the ring did not react normally, so its light extinguished straightaway.</p>

  <p>According to Yolande's previous deductions, Luo Zheng's Lotus Flower had at least sprouted seven petals. It was very likely that it had sprouted nine petals, like Javier's, or perhaps it was the top-level Nine-petal Lotus Flower, like Layla's. However, she had never expected Luo Luo Zheng to activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower when he was only at the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>However, her deduction was only based on the reaction of the Red Cloud Ring. How many petals had Luo Zheng's Mahayana Lotus Flower sprouted?</p>

  <p>Eleven petals? Thirteen? Or even fifteen? She did not ask Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing Timothy's doubts, she only laughed coldly and stared at him, saying, "In Mist Palace, who has the final say?"</p>
