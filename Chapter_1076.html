<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Randy had extended his challenge to Luo Luo Zheng just a few days ago.</p>

  <p>So it was kind of weird for Luo Luo Zheng to see him act as if they were the best of friends who hadn't seen each other for a long time.</p>

  <p>The smile was frozen on his face. "I've been fine." Luo Luo Zheng said through his teeth.</p>

  <p>Randy put his arm around him in a brotherly manner before taking the golden invitation from his hand. He flipped it over before handing it back to the crown prince, "Luo Zheng's already promised to go to my place today so your invitation is just way too late!"</p>

  <p>When had he agreed to visit his place? Luo Luo Zheng had just received the crown prince's invitation and was just thinking about what to do when Randy came out of nowhere and acted all friendly with him.</p>

  <p>Still, he appreciated his intervention. Despite Randy being arrogant and temperamental, he had an air of integrity around him. The crown prince, on the other hand, was too shrewd for Luo Zheng's taste.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not going to pass up this perfect opportunity to reject the crown prince's invitation. He nodded his head as if to show his agreement with Randy's words.</p>

  <p>"It is indeed too late to invite me now, Your Highness. Lord Randy's already invited me to his residence," Luo Luo Zheng said, patting Randy's hand as a signal for him to get his arm off his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Randy's hand refused to budge from Luo Zheng's shoulder and there was a huge smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Back when his cultivation level was still very low, the crown prince did not even bother batting an eyelash at Randy's direction. However, he gradually grew stronger and climbed the social ladder to a point wherein he could stand on the same ground as the crown prince.</p>

  <p>Still, the crown prince was over ten years older than Randy and was set to inherit the throne. Despite being conferred the title of Lord as recognition of his strength, Randy had fewer followers compared to his brother.</p>

  <p>The crown prince had recently heard of the warrior that had triumphed over Randy at the Jade Martial House. His interest was instantly piqued and he knew that he had to establish a relationship with this exceptional warrior. He had traveled from the capital all the way to Crane City just to see Luo Luo Zheng to draw him to his side.</p>

  <p>But, it just so happened that Randy had burst out of nowhere and interfered with his plans.</p>

  <p>Of course he knew that these two only pretended to be close acquaintances to fool him. He was a crown prince and he knew how to play this game. And sometimes, he played his cards right and knew when to fold. He was not at a position to force Luo Luo Zheng to do anything so he took the magnanimous route and gave a hearty laugh. "A shame! It seemed I did not come here on time."</p>

  <p>"You did arrive rather abruptly. I admire your speed," Randy retorted.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of hostility that flashed through the crown prince's eyes but his face remained calm. With a smile he spun the wheelchair around and left, his entourage of masters following closely behind him.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Randy dropped his arm off Luo Zheng's shoulder. There was a triumphant cold smile on his face as he watched the crown prince leave.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you brothers?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. "Why do you have to go against each other like this?"</p>

  <p>The internal struggles of the divine kingdom's royal family baffled Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Warriors were incomparably selfish but they paled in comparison to the royal family and just how much they schemed against their own flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>"I treat him as my brother but he doesn't even treat me as a person,"</p>

  <p>Randy replied coldly.</p>

  <p>The expression on his face could only be described as both furious and anguished. There must be some awful memories between the two brothers for them to have this much animosity with each other.</p>

  <p>However, that was their issue. Luo Luo Zheng knew it wasn't something he really wanted to embroil himself in.</p>

  <p>Just as he was thinking of where he should go now, Randy nudged him.</p>

  <p>"So? you're going to my place today, right?" he asked with a crafty smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng scoffed, "This? unbelievable."</p>

  <p>He had played along with Randy's ridiculous lie in order to reject the crown prince's invitation but now, it seemed as if the matter was actually serious.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I won't put you in an awkward situation. It'll be fine as long as one of us wins over the other," Randy said but also lowered his voice. "My brother won't give up on you so easily. He has probably already mobilized his people to keep an eye out for you. If you don't go to my place after you rejected his invitation today, he'd surely come to meet with you another time..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed in defeat. It truly seemed that he had no choice.</p>

  <p>"Fine," he said wryly. Even if Randy wasn't really equipped with a pleasing personality, he was at least straightforward. Luo Luo Zheng would choose the Lord over the crown prince any day.</p>

  <p>A shrewd ally could never be regarded as a true ally after all.</p>

  <p>And that was how Luo Luo Zheng found himself standing in front of Randy's mansion with Francis in tow.</p>

  <p>The mansion was located south of Crane City. It was extraordinarily grandiose with rich architecture, luxurious amenities, and a refined scenery.</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered, four Life and Death Realm masters quickly surrounded them. They all looked rather nervous as they rushed towards Randy. "Your Highness, where did you go? We were looking all over for you!"</p>

  <p>Randy rolled his eyes. "Why? Do I need to keep you updated every minute of every day about my whereabouts?"</p>

  <p>"This... No. No, Your Highness. You don't," one of the Life and Death Realm masters replied, immediately bowing his head.</p>

  <p>Randy snorted and walked past them. Just as they were about to follow him, Randy sent them a glare that froze them in their steps. "Stop right there. The four of you should stay here and guard the door!"</p>

  <p>"We..."</p>

  <p>A Life and Death Realm warrior, though not rare in the divine kingdom, couldn't just be reduced to a mere doorkeeper.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Randy raised an eyebrow. "Are you not going to do as I say?"</p>

  <p>Sensing the anger that was boiling through Randy's blood, the four Life and Death Realm warriors hurriedly retreated and took their places by the mansion's entrance.</p>

  <p>Randy gave Luo Luo Zheng a meaningful look. "Isn't it quite ridiculous?" he chuckled.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned. "These people?"</p>

  <p>"All the guards and servants in my mansion? They're all my brother's people,"</p>

  <p>Randy told him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a beautiful woman entered the threshold. The woman had a Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivation base, was good-looking, well-dressed, and looked like the perfect match for a warrior. Someone like her no doubt had the ability to make any man fall in love with her.</p>

  <p>She smiled when she saw Randy and hurried towards him. "You're back!</p>

  <p>I'll..."</p>

  <p>"Don't you dare come near me!" Randy shouted, not even giving her the chance to finish her words.</p>

  <p>His reaction made her freeze. "Y-Your Highness?" she mumbled as fat, hot tears began to roll down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"What're you standing there for? I asked you to go away, didn't I?" he coldly reprimanded.</p>

  <p>The woman's lips trembled but, under his command, she slowly retreated and disappeared from the Lord's view.</p>

  <p>"That woman is also under my brother's control," Randy said sadly.</p>

  <p>Even she was arranged by the crown prince!</p>

  <p>This truly rendered Luo Luo Zheng speechless.</p>

  <p>Outside, Randy was an object of envy for the ordinary folk. He was strong, talented, and greatly honored by the entire divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>However, none of them knew how much of a prisoner he actually was in his own home.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could now understand why he treated the crown prince like that earlier. It seemed the grudge between the two brothers truly ran deep.</p>

  <p>The enmity between the two brothers wasn't a secret. The entire divine kingdom practically knew about it and even Francis was aware of this matter.</p>

  <p>Randy was simply too outstanding and that was his biggest crime against his brother. His power threatened the crown prince's claim to the throne and when it came to the throne, the crown prince would not tolerate any kind of competition, familial ties be damned.</p>

  <p>The crown prince couldn't really take action against Randy because of their father. However, he could still restrain his brother's actions and make him suffer through other methods.</p>

  <p>And perhaps he had used the cruelest method of all: make his brother live inside a beautiful, hollow prison where he had no one he could trust.</p>

  <p>Of course, it did not just stop there, there was also that matter of entering the secret lands of the Feather Holy Sea. Randy knew he would need to gather warriors to form his own team. He couldn't just go there on his own.</p>

  <p>The crown prince had 'offered' his help to find people for him but Randy naturally rejected since he knew his brother's real intentions. The problem, however, was that besides the crown prince, there was really no one else he could turn to.</p>

  <p>All the young, talented masters were already in the crown prince's faction while the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors that remained weren't that powerful. Randy had managed to invite a handful of warriors who would be able to enter the second tier but they were still not enough. His meager force could never hope to contend against his brother.</p>

  <p>When he met Luo Luo Zheng, Randy had already made up his mind to fight him.</p>

  <p>Under the guidance of the Jade Martial House's master, he had managed to restrain himself with the hopes that this young man would be of great help to him.</p>

  <p>At last, they were finally able to enter the main hall. Francis remained at the door while both Luo Luo Zheng and Randy were served tea by the servants. As soon as the tea was poured, Randy immediately chased them out.</p>

  <p>He looked up at Luo Luo Zheng and stared at him with sparkling eyes. "Why do you want to enter the Feather Holy Sea?" he asked. "I think I can work with you."</p>
