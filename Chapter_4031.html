<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Jade Pure Realm, on the immense, hundred mile long and wide Pure Sky Platform, stood a huge treasure bottle in the shape of a gourd.</p>

  <p>It was crystal clear and beamed magnificent colors as light reflected off it and refracted through it.</p>

  <p>A wide river flowed beside the treasure bottle, appearing out of the void of the Jade Pure Realm and passing through the Treasure Bottle Platform.</p>

  <p>This was the famous Divine River.</p>

  <p>Many giants' corpses lay on either side of the Divine River.</p>

  <p>Blood gurgled from their bodies and into the river through the drains, dying it a blood red.</p>

  <p>A fat monk stood beside the corpses, smiling relentlessly. He appeared kind and friendly by his face, but the blood soaked into his robe said otherwise.</p>

  <p>He grabbed a corpse and pushed it into the Divine River.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The body drifted down with the current.</p>

  <p>On the opposite side of the river, a woman in a long robe was covered in blood as well, her once pure white robe now a deep red. Like the fat monk, she too was pushing corpses into the river.</p>

  <p>The fat man might have looked like a monk, but he was in fact a Taoist priest. His name was Darby and he was the eldest disciple of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The woman was Stella, the youngest of the Grandmaster of Heaven's disciples.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect our master to kill so many giants in only three days. His strength must have increased significantly," sighed Darby.</p>

  <p>The giants in the Jade Pure Realm possessed terrifying strength.</p>

  <p>Facing so many was incomprehensible. If Darby came face to face with just one, he would be forced to retreat.</p>

  <p>Being the eldest disciple, not only did he have all kinds of treasures, but the bloodline he had obtained from the Eternal Scroll Painting was extremely magical too. He was definitely among the top figures of the many Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>A speck of worry appeared in Stella's eyes. "Our master has indeed become stronger, but did you notice that he seemed almost entirely not himself during the battle?"</p>

  <p>"It's understandable. He was so determined to kill his opponents that perhaps he forgot himself a little and was not as kind as usual," Darby said as if this was common knowledge.</p>

  <p>But Stella shook her head and replied, "No, it was more than that. It felt to me that he was possessed by a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Do you remember how our sister died?"</p>

  <p>Darby darkened at the mention of their sister and scolded, "Don't ever mention her again!"</p>

  <p>The sister they were talking about was the second disciple of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>She took care of Samantha, Sienna and Stella like a mother and they treated her as one.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven once encountered a powerful enemy and in the heat of battle, he lost control. He bullied his opponent back, forcing him to retreat before he slaughtered him like a mad man.</p>

  <p>Although he was victorious, in his wildness, he had accidentally killed his second disciple.</p>

  <p>This shadow of hurt had always lingered in Stella's heart. It was a difficult reality for all three sisters to face.</p>

  <p>Stella had buried the matter within the depths of herself, but the way the Grandmaster of Heaven mauled his way through all the giants in a craze brought it all back.</p>

  <p>She had been standing close to one of the giants as he rampaged. If Darby hadn't dragged her away, the Grandmaster of Heaven would have killed her as well.</p>

  <p>When she looked into his eyes, an uncontrollable shiver ran through her. As she looked at him, he was not a person anymore, but a disgusting Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>They had won the battle on the Treasure Bottle Platform, but the thought of the look on her master's face unearthed memories of her big sister and made her terribly uneasy.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected such a harsh reaction from Darby when she mentioned their dead sister.</p>

  <p>But Darby's heart softened when he saw the grief on her face and immediately made an attempt to comfort her. "Master has his worries too.</p>

  <p>Many things are not as simple as they seem. How do we fight the Element Spirit Civilization? Do you think it's possible for Master to do this alone?"</p>

  <p>As the outside world saw it, the Grandmaster of Heaven alone led the Nihility race in the fight against the Element Spirit Civilization. However, very few knew the truth and even Stella and her other two sisters were clueless as to it.</p>

  <p>Stella pursed her lips and calmed down, admitting in a low voice, "I know.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of person he is, he will always be my master."</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Darby pushed another giant's corpse into the Divine River and the water rippled as it fell. With a smile, he said, "That's right. We shouldn't doubt our master."</p>

  <p>Many of the elites of the Nihility race were from other races, but only nine, including the Grandmaster of Heaven, were humans. Naturally, they had always been close with one another.</p>

  <p>Four red spheres floated under the massive treasure bottle.</p>

  <p>Powerhouses of different shapes floated in these red spheres. They all advocated the Nihility Way and some were leaders of their races on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>With their faith in the Nihility Way, they did all they could to destroy absolutely everything, and so it made sense for them to follow the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>They were Ewing, Sloan, Phelps and Larson.</p>

  <p>They each used their own theurgies in an attempt to open the treasure bottle.</p>

  <p>But all their efforts were in vain as the bottle remained motionless. On the bottle was a single Sanskrit word, "seal", and around the word were thick lines that extended all over the bottle.</p>

  <p>They knew the sturdiness and stubbornness of the bottle were related to the word on it, but none of them could find a way to break it.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is in the bottle that the Element Spirit Civilization has to protect it like this?" Ewing's rough voice asked from one of the red spheres.</p>

  <p>"In addition to the numerous giants, there are also so many hostility-level Treacherous Beings. Whatever is in this bottle must be very valuable,"</p>

  <p>Phelps speculated.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect us to not be able to open the bottle after we took the Treasure Bottle Platform. This is really embarrassing."</p>

  <p>As the four were deep in discussion, the Grandmaster of Heaven sauntered over.</p>

  <p>He wore a golden robe that fluttered even though there was no wind. He was a truly intimidating figure to behold.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He stretched out a hand and drew a black dagger from his waist. It was not made of gold, copper or jade, but instead looked like the tooth of some kind of monster.</p>

  <p>"That's the tooth of someone in the darkness! How did you get that?" Sloan, who looked like a cat and was the first on the left, asked.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't answer him. He leaped gracefully and nailed the black dagger firmly in the Sanskrit word, and the lines strewn across the bottle began glowing as he did.</p>

  <p>The light faded and the lines that had been used to sustain the bottle turned into cracks.</p>

  <p>A pale yellow energy emitted from the bottle, shocking the four powerful creatures when they saw it.</p>
