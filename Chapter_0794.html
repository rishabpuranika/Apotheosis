<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the beginning, seven divine kingdoms coexisted peacefully with the Dragon Lineage Human. However, when the Dragon Lineage Human perished and three of the seven divine kingdoms were destroyed, the remaining four divine kingdoms were left.</p>

  <p>These four divine kingdoms were located within the main continent of this world and their riches far surpassed the resources of the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>The inheritance of these four divine kingdoms could be traced back to the beginning of the world itself.</p>

  <p>As the prince of the divine kingdom waved his serpentine sword, a surge of life vitality burst forth and transformed into a massive snake behind him.</p>

  <p>The snake was extremely strange? it had a huge dragon's head but the thin body of a serpent; its eyes were demonic red, and it emitted an astonishingly terrifying Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Demonic dragon..." Imogen murmured in horror as she looked at the horrifying monster.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie bit her lips. "Luo Luo Zheng?" she whispered, glancing at him in worry.</p>

  <p>All the other warriors at the Life and Death Realm from the Central Region, including Eddie and the Ancient Tycoon, sported serious expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"The divine kingdom's martial arts heritage is truly formidable!" someone exclaimed. "Although the prince is only at the early stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm and his cultivation level is suppressed, he can still erupt with such strength. He cannot be underestimated."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is screwed! He is only at the Illuminating Soul Realm. Moreover, his cultivation level has been suppressed," another warrior also said. "It's weird though. The prince is still taking him so seriously. Isn't this the same as using a sledgehammer on a gnat?"</p>

  <p>"No matter what, Luo Luo Zheng is dead for sure. He shouldn't have provoked the people from the divine kingdom from the start. They have a far superior foundation than all of us."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, wasn't paying any attention to the others' discussion.</p>

  <p>He remained on high alert and on the defensive as he faced the prince and his demonic dragon.</p>

  <p>If the prince had just been some random warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, there wouldn't have been any need for Luo Luo Zheng to fear him. After their cultivation levels were suppressed, everyone's cultivation level would drop by a whole realm. In theory, the prince should be at the early stage of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation level hadn't been suppressed, so much so that he could instantly kill such an opponent.</p>

  <p>However, the prince seemed like someone extraordinary. The cultivation method he used had a domineering Mu Ning to it and Luo Luo Zheng could somehow feel a faint sense of familiarity from the demonic dragon. It was actually related to his bloodline.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng tried to focus on his enemy, he was also pondering on why his bloodline had a trace of connection with the demonic dragon.</p>

  <p>"Because the cultivation method the prince cultivates is something that the Dragon Lineage Human left behind," the cyan dragon suddenly said.</p>

  <p>His words surprised Luo Luo Zheng. "A cultivation method left behind by the Dragon Lineage Human?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's right," the cyan dragon confirmed. "The Dragon Lineage Human was completely annihilated within this world and the Dragon Soar Arena had been lost for so many years. Their legacy was naturally taken away by the four divine kingdoms. The prince's cultivation technique is called 'Dragon-snake Sacred Body' and can be considered a top-tier cultivation method in the Dragon Lineage Human. This technique requires the absorption of the blood of a genuine dragon. However, that would be impossible for him. He must've found a demonic dragon that contained the blood of a genuine dragon and then absorbed its blood."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng licked his lips and nodded in understanding. "So that's how it is," he said. However, though it solved the mystery in his heart, it did nothing for the crisis he was currently in.</p>

  <p>Even if the prince's cultivation level had been suppressed by a realm, it would still be extremely difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to deal with him.</p>

  <p>As he faced the demonic dragon behind the prince, Luo Zheng's iron sword suddenly began to shake.</p>

  <p>One circle...</p>

  <p>Two circles...</p>

  <p>Three circles...</p>

  <p>Four circles...</p>

  <p>After a period of cultivation, Luo Luo Zheng had been able to finally practice the Exterminating Wheel of "Malicious Wheel of Life and Death" to an incredibly proficient level.</p>

  <p>However, he had never used it in front of others.</p>

  <p>He was not a bloodthirsty person, so accumulating malicious Mu Ning wasn't an easy task for him. Therefore, he had always kept the "Malicious Wheel of Life and Death" at the bottom of his chest as his trump card.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, Luo Luo Zheng had not hesitated to use this hidden trump card of his.</p>

  <p>The prince's face was unyielding despite the four Exterminating Wheels that floated silently beside his opponent. He merely glanced at Luo Luo Zheng, his eyes betraying the viciousness he concealed.</p>

  <p>He gently waved his serpentine sword and, as he did, the giant demonic dragon coiled around him protectively. It let out a shrill cry before suddenly charging at Luo Luo Zheng its mouth opened wide and ready to swallow him.</p>

  <p>"Dragon-snake Devour!" the prince shouted.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!" The demonic dragon yelled.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his sword at the ready and quickly communicated with the distant Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>A malicious Mu Ning suddenly burst forth!</p>

  <p>The presence of such a violent and malicious Mu Ning struck fear into the hearts of the warriors present.</p>

  <p>When a person killed, he would be cursed and infected with malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>However, so long as he did not accumulate too much, the Mu Ning would naturally dissipate though it would take quite a long time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's malicious Mu Ning would not dissipate. He had stored it all in the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>And at that moment, he had let it out so suddenly.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, there had been no slightest trace of malicious Mu Ning from him. But now, the Mu Ning that emanated from his body made it feel as though he had already slaughtered a million different creatures. Even the warriors at the Life and Death realm were frightened of him.</p>

  <p>"That brat! He has so much malicious Mu Ning! Is he not afraid?"</p>

  <p>"What a terrifying malicious Mu Ning! How did he do it? Such volume couldn't be hidden so easily. How come we weren't able to sense it before?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng has too many secrets. I really can't understand him."</p>

  <p>Every cultivation method that used malicious Mu Ning was extremely overbearing and fierce.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng extracted his malicious Mu Ning from the Killing Sword Mountain, it was instantly thrown into the four Exterminating Wheels. Soon after, his sword shadow gently pointed to the demonic dragon.</p>

  <p>The demonic dragon had already been before Luo Luo Zheng. But before it could attack, it was suddenly pierced by the surging malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The dragon's head had been directly pierced by the four streaks of malicious Mu Ning, which went through its body, out of its tail and straight towards the prince.</p>

  <p>The way things had been going stunned the prince, freezing him in place.</p>

  <p>However, just as the four streaks of malicious Mu Ning rushed towards him, a faint light enveloped his entire body, as if to protect him.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The light curtain bounced back and prevented the malicious Mu Ning from successfully piercing through the prince. As the beams were deflected and the light faded, the jade pendant that hung from the prince's chest suddenly broke apart.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but smile in amusement. "A pretty good amulet you got there," he said. "It saved you once, but it can't save you a second time!" He suddenly shot up and flew to the sky. After his body refinement and comprehension of Space Law, Luo Zheng's movements had become extremely fast without any need of practicing any movement skill.</p>

  <p>The prince flinched and staggered back. "Don't kill me!" he shouted, his face revealing a trace of fear. "If you kill me, you will pay the price!"</p>

  <p>"What price? Your people will kill me, right?" Luo Luo Zheng snorted coldly before diving towards the ground and closing in on his opponent. He raised his sword, and activated the power of 500 dragon scales, ready to swing the sword down towards the prince.</p>

  <p>CLANG!</p>

  <p>The strength of his strike had been enough to fling the prince's sword away from his grip and even slash his palm. Luo Zheng's power was comparable to that of a mountain and there was no way the prince could've blocked his attack at all.</p>

  <p>Without his sword, the prince's face blanched and he quickly ran away. His fleeing figure annoyed Luo Luo Zheng greatly.</p>

  <p>This prince supposedly had a noble background and great talent. Ever since he was young, he had always used his privilege to crush others. Because of this, he had forgotten how to gauge the strength of others and could only blindly rush forward in an attempt to crush his opponents. He wasn't stupid but he could be cowardly since every time he came across someone he couldn't defeat, he would start acting dumb and try to run away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and rushed towards the prince to block his path. "Are you really at the Virtual Tribulation Realm? You are too weak for me."</p>

  <p>And with that, Luo Luo Zheng raised his sword once again and swung it down.</p>

  <p>"NO!" Elder Gong's voice rang loudly in the chasm and made Luo Luo Zheng hesitate with his strike.</p>

  <p>"If you kill him, I will definitely kill you," the Holy Maiden declared, staring coldly at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A moment's hesitation was all it took for the prince to successfully dodge Luo Zheng's sword, twisting his body like a snake in the face of danger. However, even if his body was able to avoid the blade, his mind was suddenly wracked with pain. It was so intense that it felt as if his soul was being torn apart.</p>

  <p>The prince writhed on his knees, his eyes rolling back in a vain attempt to block the pain. Suddenly, a silver light flashed and pierced through his head? Luo Luo Zheng had cleanly ended the challenge with a broken, flying knife.</p>

  <p>The truth was that the prince's strength wasn't much worse than Luo Zheng's even if his cultivation level had been suppressed. It was only because of his conceited nature that he was defeated since he hadn't expected Luo Luo Zheng to be so strong and was thus caught off guard.</p>

  <p>However, even if the prince had gone all out, he still might've lost. Luo Zheng's cultivation level, after all, hadn't been suppressed.</p>

  <p>Silence rang in the depths of the chasm.</p>

  <p>For a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm to be able to kill someone at the Virtual Tribulation Realm was truly unbelievable, and everyone could only stare at Luo Luo Zheng in disbelief, rendered speechless by his abilities.</p>
