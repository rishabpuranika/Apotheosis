  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since the Strength God Totem was a strengthening type of Other Shore Token, it could only release 1, 200 divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>Zheng gathered this force in his right hand. To his satisfaction, he could feel that the light dots scattered within his body danced happily.</p>

  <p>Although the power was concentrated in his right hand, the light dots all over his body bore the power together. It was a wonderful feeling.</p>

  <p>'These light dots have an innate affinity for power. They can completely absorb both the Other Shore Power from my body and the power created by the outside world, ' Zheng thought with a smile.</p>

  <p>Only after absorbing the Chaotic Source Spirits did Zheng truly understand the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power could make one's own body grow infinitely, and the strength of the physical body could also constantly increase. On the other hand, the innate disadvantage of the Grand World Cultivation Method was that one couldn't refine their physical body. Thus they had to choose to make use of the Chaotic Source Spirits for cultivation in the end.</p>

  <p>Even the 1, 200 megatons of power wasn't Zheng's limit; simultaneously, he tried drawing more power from the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>Gradually, as its power flowed into Zheng's body, he felt the pressure in his right hand continue to increase.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The light dots within his body practically buzzed with excitement. Zheng felt a stream of burning power being released from them.</p>

  <p>1, 300 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>1, 500 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>1, 800 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>2, 000 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>When the power reached 2, 000 divine megatons, it seemed the dots of light had reached their limit.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't stop there. When he continued to exert the Other Shore Power, the light dots dimmed rapidly.</p>

  <p>Three seconds passed...</p>

  <p>Six seconds...</p>

  <p>Nine seconds...</p>

  <p>After nine seconds, the radiance in the light dots were all gone, and the 2, 00 dots of light in his body were quickly exhausted.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, spread out the Other Shore Power quickly. Otherwise, your body won't be able to bear it, and will consequently collapse," No. 9527 cautioned.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body could be likened to a balloon filled with air. The dots of light helped the balloon's material stay intact, but once the Chaotic Source Spirits were exhausted, the power would be out of control. The force of 2, 000 divine megatons would be enough to cause his body to explode!</p>

  <p>At No. 9527's reminder, Zheng suddenly threw a punch forward. The 2, 000 divine megatons of power was unleashed, destroying the entire wall before him.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The punch was so powerful that a deep furrow was plowed out in the palace courtyard. Even a part of the aisle in front of the palace was damaged.</p>

  <p>Some guards of the Pear Hill who had been nearby rushed towards the sound to find out what all the ruckus was about. To their surprise, the palace wall had crumbled, exposing a guilty-looking Zheng from within.</p>

  <p>"This is the thirteenth time tonight!" a guard complained. "How can the Oneness Sky Palace disciples who live here be so reckless?!"</p>

  <p>Today, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had all wanted to test the strength of their physical bodies since reaching the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Many disciples unscrupulously used their Other Shore Tokens to the maximum. The Other Shore Power flowed within their bodies. Their newfound strength made them feel empowered.</p>

  <p>However, the Chaotic Source Spirits only bore the power for roughly a day, and their dots of light were rather weak. Fusing with the Other Shore Power quickly exhausted the Chaotic Source Spirits. To prevent their physical bodies from collapsing, they had no choice but to release all the energy.</p>

  <p>In this particular row of palaces, havoc was wreaked. Some roofs were overturned, some courtyards were flattened, and ditches dotted the road from randomly unleashed punches.</p>

  <p>The head of the guards made a 'hiss' expression. He was clear that among the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace living in these palaces, one warrior was the most honorable guest.</p>

  <p>It was said that he was Yan's brother.</p>

  <p>Yan was well known in the Pear Hill, since she held a high position. In the whole Pear Hill, even the leaders of sects and mountains seldom had the chance to meet the Snake Goddess in the flesh. On the other hand, Yan had been treated like the Snake Goddess's own daughter.</p>

  <p>After shooting a glare at the noisy complainant, the leader of the guards entered Zheng's courtyard. Zheng, upon seeing his approach, smiled sheepishly and said, "I'm sorry. I couldn't control my own strength."</p>

  <p>"It's all our fault," the leader of the guards responded amicably. "You all have just passed the test of the Chaotic Source World; we should've expected that you would need to focus on cultivation. Please, follow me to the training room." He gestured.</p>

  <p>Under the arrangement of the leader of the guards, Zheng moved from this damaged palace to another.</p>

  <p>After the Chaotic Source Spirits got fatigued, they couldn't recover fast.</p>

  <p>About two hours later, the light dots, which dimmed just now, gradually became lustrous again.</p>

  <p>"After you merge with the Chaotic Source Spirits, the Oneness Sky Palace will give you the body refining method to train them. By then, you need to be able to constantly extract the Other Shore Power to stimulate the Chaotic Source Spirits. This way, the Chaotic Source Spirits in your body will gradually become stronger," No. 9527 explained.</p>

  <p>"So this method of body refining is to use the Chaotic Source Spirits repeatedly?" Zheng clarified.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the methods of body refining of various races are similar. It will take some time to master," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Fusing with the Chaotic Source Spirits meant merging them with their own body; they could only strengthen them gradually, by feeding them with the Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had reached the Chaotic Source Realm many years ago; it was no wonder the Chaotic Source Spirits in their bodies were much stronger than those of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng could only imagine how strong the Chaotic Source Spirits of people like Athemar were.</p>

  <p>"It seems that such growth speed is too low..." Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Having reached the Chaotic Source Realm meant that everyone was starting from the same level. However, many powerful warriors in the Source World had reached the Chaotic Source Realm thousands, or even millions, of years earlier than Zheng.</p>

  <p>These thoughts raced through Zheng's mind as he attempted to extract the Other Shore Power again.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had only infused the Other Shore Power of about 800 divine megatons. Most of the power was borne directly by his own physical body.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's physical body endured excessive Other Shore Power, it would glow a faint golden light. The aura that emanated from him was very similar to the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 and Regal Jade Spirit had not been able to figure out what kind of Truth of Godly Way it was. At the very least, they knew it was completely different from the real Truth of Powerful Holy Body.</p>

  <p>800 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>900 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>1, 000 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>Zheng came to a halt upon reaching 1, 000 divine megatons of power.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's physical body was being refined, he could exert only a small amount of power.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning, when Zheng's physical body was refined, there would be warm currents appearing in his body. These warm currents could have effect on his body in the beginning, but now they were almost ineffective.</p>

  <p>However, the more Zheng fought in battle, the stronger the aura of the Truth of Godly Way became.</p>

  <p>Although the aura was special, Zheng still couldn't figure out a way to make use of it.</p>
