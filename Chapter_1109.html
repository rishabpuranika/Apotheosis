<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1109 Sun Flame Attack (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Like normal beasts, super legendary beasts were also divided into different levels.</p>

  <p>A ninth level fierce beast would be equivalent to a human warrior at Virtual Tribulation Realm, a tenth level one would be equivalent to a human warrior at Life and Death Realm, and an eleventh level one would be equivalent to a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Regardless whether the beasts were super legendary or normal fierce ones, once they reached eleventh level, their demon cores would liquefy, allowing them to open up a new world.</p>

  <p>Despite that, there was still a great disparity between a fierce beast and a legendary beast, a legendary beast and a super legendary beast.</p>

  <p>A super legendary beast, such as a Genuine Dragon or a Genuine Phoenix, would have a far superior growing speed and special talents over an ordinary legendary beast or a fierce beast. Like the super talents in the human race, they could also challenge opponents who were levels above them with ease.</p>

  <p>"We have contracted an alliance by the use of my spirit and my soul. The Genuine Phoenix named Fiery Shine, listen to my commands, and follow me!" At that moment, Fiona's voice suddenly became extremely authoritative.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Phoenix which went by the name of Fiery Shine was Fiona's contractual beast. The stronger the cultivator was, the stronger his or her contractual beast would be. Fiona was only at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but she was already able to have such a beast under her command. Even in the Upper World, it was extremely rare for someone to have a Genuine Phoenix as a contractual beast!</p>

  <p>Much like the Genuine Dragon race, the number of Genuine Phoenixes in the Genuine Phoenix race was extremely small. For instance, the Genuine Dragon World had 49 fully grown Genuine Dragons. If you counted the young ones, its total number would still be less than a thousand. Despite that the Genuine Phoenixes generally outnumbered the Genuine Dragons, they still would not break ten thousand in number.</p>

  <p>That, coupled with the fact that there were trillions of warriors in the Upper World, one would realize that to have a Genuine Phoenix as one's contractual beast was not an easy feat to achieve!</p>

  <p>Perhaps only the descendants of Supreme Lords would have such a privilege!</p>

  <p>The strength that Fiona had displayed had the mighty masters of Soul Sea Realm impressed and amazed. The little girl from the Huo Clan had grown to such a powerful warrior without anyone noticing.</p>

  <p>When they saw her contractual beast, Fiery Shine, their eyes widened so much to the point that it seemed like their eyes would pop out. Nothing could relay the astonishment they felt at that moment.</p>

  <p>"War King Wind, you have really hid your secret well!" War Emperor York coldly ridiculed.</p>

  <p>Whatever happened, the four divine kingdoms were on the same boat.</p>

  <p>Because of that, they didn't keep too many secrets from each other. For instance, the secret of that little monster from the Nine Furnace Martial House was shared by the several war emperors and war kings.</p>

  <p>Despite that, War King Wind had trained such a character without disclosing it to anyone.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Fiona's current strength wasn't enough to threaten anyone from the divine kingdoms, but what if she and her Genuine Phoenix matured in the future? What would happen if this Genuine Phoenix reached the eleventh level? Perhaps none of the Soul Sea Realm masters was able to be its match then.</p>

  <p>With the veil of secrecy lifted over Fiona and her strong contractual beast, the three other kings couldn't help but feel betrayed. They started to think how many secrets War King Wind was hiding, and whether he could still be trusted.</p>

  <p>Turning to War Emperor York, War King Wind subtly smiled and calmly said, "Lucien, don't be so ridiculous. If I wanted to intentionally hide Fiona, I wouldn't have allowed her to participate in this battle."</p>

  <p>What he said was the truth. From the beginning to the end, War King Wind had not given Fiona any hints. He just let her fight the battle in any way she wanted. Even if Fiona chose to summon her contractual beast, he did nothing to stop her.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the faces of the several rulers of the divine kingdoms softened. Despite that they had felt distrust towards War King Wind, they realized that Fiona having a Genuine Phoenix as a contractual beast was actually a good thing for the entire Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>The warriors' growth in the Divine Kingdom Continent was limited. No one could rebuild the passageway leading to the Upper World. Therefore, all the mighty masters at the Soul Sea Realm would eventually die here.</p>

  <p>However, there was no limit to the growth of a Genuine Phoenix. If this Genuine Phoenix was given a chance to fully grow, there might be a chance to rebuild the passageway leading to the Upper World!</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>The Genuine Phoenix named Fiery Shine suddenly let out a high-pitched cry and circled around Fiona. It then rose up from behind Fiona, spreading out its dozen feet wide wings. It looked directly at Luo Zheng, its eyes full of power. Its feathers, which were about a hundred feet long each, spread around Fiona.</p>

  <p>On top of each and every feather was a blazing flame, and from them streamed Fire Law. It was a beautiful sight to behold.</p>

  <p>'The third layer of the Fire Law…'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought. It was his estimate of the level of the Fire Law as he felt the intensity of it. The flames emitting from the Genuine Phoenix never ceased. They had the power to destroy everything, but at the same time, there was a vigorous life force hidden within them.</p>

  <p>Although this Genuine Phoenix was only at the ninth level, it made Luo Zheng feel a strong sense of being overpowered. This overwhelming force was much stronger than what Eddie emitted when they faced each other.</p>

  <p>Truly, a super legendary beast wasn't something to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>If Fiona's contractual beast had been a Genuine Dragon or an ice phoenix, the pressure on Luo Zheng would definitely have multiplied. The strength of this super legendary beast was probably comparable to that of a master at the fourth or fifth level of the Life and Death Realm. Fiona was also someone who shouldn't be overlooked. Luo Zheng, with all his power and strength, did not have the confidence that he would be able to defeat them.</p>
