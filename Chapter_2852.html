<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Harold was aware of the dynamics of Lorena and Joy's relationship.</p>

  <p>Lorena was an arrogant person. She had quarreled with his master because of Joy. At one point, they couldn't tolerate each other!</p>

  <p>Now that many years had passed, and everyone had gone through so much hardship, he assumed that they would have put aside all their past disputes.</p>

  <p>Besides, Lorena was already a mother-in-law, so she wouldn't quarrel due to jealousy in front of her son.</p>

  <p>After Lorena entered the hall, Yudie walked up to her with a cup of tea in her hand. She said with a slight blush, "Mother, please have some tea..."</p>

  <p>Although these women had seen a lot, they felt strange to face their motherin-law who suddenly popped up.</p>

  <p>Lorena examined Yudie with a smile on her face and praised her good looks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then introduced Yudie, Margaret, Xun and Aura to her one by one...</p>

  <p>Every race had different customs. Xun might not be aware of the concept of a mother-in-law, so Luo Zheng tried his best to explain to her.</p>

  <p>Lorena was very happy to see Luo Zheng's wives and she chatted amicably with them.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the women kept chatting nonstop, Harold and Hallet became increasingly anxious.</p>

  <p>They were mostly concerned about how Luo Zheng had come back and how he managed to bring Lorena and Sword Chen back...</p>

  <p>When there was a brief pause in the conversation, Harold took advantage and interrupted them. "Luo Zheng, what exactly happened in the Abyss Demon Region?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Harold unwittingly rescued Luo Zheng from his mother's non-stop questions.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, his mother would interrogate him more. He said immediately,</p>

  <p>"Well, let me start with the Stone Mouse. When I just arrived at Evil Ghost Region..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng recounted everything including how he met Leland in the Evil Ghost Region and what happened on the Reincarnation Land later and how he encountered Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Iris were seated on the other side of the hall. Tianming occasionally interjected the conversation, describing what he saw on the side of the alliance of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>When they heard that Luo Zheng had been dragged into the ice coffin and that he and Tianming had to face Nicholas, everyone was astounded!</p>

  <p>Nobody really thought that there was so much hatred between Samuel and Nicholas, and, more surprisingly, that there was another Nine Li member in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying that Nicholas... was killed by you two?" Harold asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Tianming nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>However, it was more accurate to say that his death was caused by the fact that his array was broken by them.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable! I don't think even our master expected that." Harold stood up abruptly. He continued with excitement etched on his face, "Since Nicholas is dead now, and other Holy Beings are still being revived, we can force the Dongfang Clan..."</p>

  <p>His plan was to force the Dongfang Clan to release Mike's body!</p>

  <p>Lorena said with a faint smile, "My husband has returned to the Evolutionary Universe. I think he will be revived shortly."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Harold said with a bitter smile, "All this should have been done by me, as I'm Master's eldest disciple. Now you have done everything and it makes me feel worthless..."</p>

  <p>Hallet had been listening silently but now he suddenly spoke up, "Since Nicholas is dead, what we need to do next is to face the Yellow Emperor Guard..."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "I'm afraid the situation is not that simple. Although Nicholas is dead, Samuel seized the opportunities and took control of the Abyss Demon Region at last. He is no less ambitious than Nicholas."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Harold's and Hallet's expressions changed. However, Augustus chuckled and said, "That's not a problem. Since you have the ability to kill Nicholas, I think this Holy Being of the Han Clan won't pose too much of a threat ..."</p>

  <p>Hallet looked at Augustus differently. They were concerned about the possible situations that might occur. After all, controlling the Abyss Demon Region meant that Samuel would be able to remove the Mixed Element Seals soon.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng finished narrating his story, he suddenly remembered something important.</p>

  <p>He put his hands to his cinnabar field and began to communicate with his inner world...</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng pointed with his finger, Liusu and Aleyna appeared in front of everyone with a flash of light.</p>

  <p>Joy was saddened when she saw them.</p>

  <p>She walked up to the two girls and, sensing their auras, she asked, "Did they lose their souls?"</p>

  <p>A dead body without a soul was just a zombie!</p>

  <p>As an old friend of the two girls, her heart ached when she realized this.</p>

  <p>Lorena also shot Luo Zheng a strange look.</p>

  <p>Having been trapped in a world for a long time, she had never seen the two girls of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"Samuel intended to use them to control the Abyss Demon Region. He used the Memory Flames to help them improve their cultivation, and, at the same time, he had taken away their own Memory Flames. They didn't lose their souls, but their memories have been completely erased," explained Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Samuel..." She repeated the name. Due to Luo Zheng's words, she already knew his real identity as well as the reason why his temper changed greatly.</p>

  <p>"Even if he has a deep, bitter hatred for Nicholas, he doesn't have to use this method for revenge. After all, they are his children. He is a beast without any human feelings whatsoever!"</p>

  <p>Joy, who was a member of the Han Clan, felt sorry for what happened to the two girls. Samuel's ghastly actions sent a chill down her spine.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. Samuel has erased their memories, but my mother will be able to retrieve their memories. Mother, please use the Reincarnation Soul Weapon to help them," Luo Zheng requested.</p>

  <p>She nodded willingly. Although she hadn't completely refined the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, she could still use its basic functions.</p>

  <p>Standing up, Lorena closed her eyes and focused her mind. She connected to the sea of Memory Flames in the Reincarnation Land and soon found the girls' Memory Flames using the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>She gently brushed her fingers over the spot between Liusu's and Aleyna's eyebrows turn by turn.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flames shot back into Liusu's and Aleyna's souls.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the girls' eyelids fluttered and they opened their eyes slowly.</p>

  <p>The moment Liusu opened her eyes, she held her head and screamed,</p>

  <p>"Dad, what are you doing?"</p>

  <p>It was moments later that Liusu finally put her hands down and stared at the scene before her eyes.</p>

  <p>Liusu's memory had paused at the moment when Samuel replaced her Memory Flame. That was why she had such a terrified reaction.</p>

  <p>Now that her Memory Flame was restored and her memory had reconnected to her soul, it continued where it left off.</p>

  <p>Liusu felt disoriented. She suddenly found herself in a strange place and she was surrounded by a bunch of strangers. No, there was one person she could recognize and that was Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Despite the great confusion in her mind, she didn't immediately ask Luo Zheng for answers. Instead, she threw herself into his arms and began to sob softly.</p>

  <p>As for Aleyna, she was completely at a loss because she didn't realize it when Samuel took away her Memory Flame. She strolled over to Joy and asked, "Aunt Joy, what happened? Where are we now?"</p>
