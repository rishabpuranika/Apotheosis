<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 880 Argument </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Located in number two space was a huge volcano where lava constantly flowed down and gathered, creating a tall, fiery waterfall.</p>

  <p>The molten red waterfall further converged into a deep pool at the bottom of the volcano, like a fearsome devil's lair.</p>

  <p>Each space was like a small, compact world.</p>

  <p>Even Soul Sea Realm masters wouldn't have the ability to create such small worlds. It was a feat that could only be done by the great masters of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>All 128 spaces functioned like 128 individual worlds and had been inside the Tower of Sin since the very beginning.</p>

  <p>If one obtained the authority over a small world, he would be able to freely change its topography. One could split open the earth, flatten mountains, and create an entirely new landscape if he willed it.</p>

  <p>However, there was no spiritual energy within these small worlds, so it was impossible to stay and train.</p>

  <p>Around the deep lava pool stood twenty-six black stone pillars, on top of which were the twenty-six ogre seat owners.</p>

  <p>Maurice stood on the first pillar. "Luo Zheng has already returned!" he declared in a loud voice as he swept his cold eyes over the crowd. "But we have yet to come to an agreement."</p>

  <p>"Just kill him directly!" a top-level war lord said sternly. "He is just a weak war general, while we are top-level war lords. If all of us work together and come at him, I'm sure we'll be able to reduce him to dust," he added.</p>

  <p>"Agreed!" another top-level war lord chimed in. "If we're afraid of a mere war general, we will lose our dignity! The other races will think we're cowards!"</p>

  <p>Malcom snorted. "Cut the bullshit!' he burst angrily. "Do you think you're stronger than war sages Colin and Neil? Even the two of them couldn't resist Luo Zheng. How sure are you that you can defeat him?"</p>

  <p>Malcom's words effectively silenced the many top-level war lords present.</p>

  <p>However, one of them spoke, "So what?" The air was tense but the top-level war lord continued, "Luo Zheng can indeed summon the Tower of Sin's power and kick us out. But the question remains. Can he actually use this power to kill someone? I don't think so!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had not killed Colin and Neil personally. He simply kicked them out of the tower and let the Cursed Land's mysterious power finish them off.</p>

  <p>However, they, as top-level war lords, would not be affected by the Cursed Land. Even if Luo Zheng kicked them out, they could enter the first floor and climb up the tower all over again.</p>

  <p>And, if all top-level war lords rushed forward to fight Luo Zheng, it would be impossible for him to kick them out all in one go.</p>

  <p>Their plan, though potentially reckless, could just work.</p>

  <p>The questions remained though.</p>

  <p>How much control did Luo Zheng really have over the Tower of Sin? Could he directly kill someone? Or was it all just limited to him being able to kick someone out?</p>

  <p>Only Luo Zheng knew.</p>

  <p>This divided the top-level war lords into two factions. One wanted to kill Luo Zheng with all their might. As long as he was eliminated, then all their troubles would cease.</p>

  <p>The other thought differently. They felt that Luo Zheng definitely still had a few hidden trump cards up his sleeve and his control over the tower might be more extensive than they previously thought. If they failed to kill Luo Zheng with their plan, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Each side was loud and aggressively laid down their arguments to try to convince the other faction that they were right. Their voices echoed across the deep pool of lava until a slightly shorter top-level war lord got up and declared with a mighty roar, "I HAVE AN IDEA!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the discussions ceased and all eyes were on him. Maurice looked at him expectantly and said, "Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Send a Night Group assassin to try to kill Luo Zheng again, but this time the assassin must be a war lord," the ogre suggested.</p>

  <p>Another ogre scoffed, "Are you kidding? What kind of idea is this?"</p>

  <p>The shorter ogre's eyes flashed dangerously. "It's a test," he said. "To know the true extent of Zheng's power in the tower."</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng could truly use the Tower of Sin's power to kill someone, then all of them would be nothing more than a couple of fish thrown on the chopping block, ready for being killed. Not even war sages could resist Zheng's power, let alone top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>However, it would be different if Luo Zheng only had the power to kick someone out.</p>

  <p>The shorter ogre had considered this for a few days before he proposed the idea.</p>

  <p>But Maurice disagreed. "I don't think it'll work. Luo Zheng is not an idiot. Even if we try to assassinate him, it'll still be difficult to gauge his strength.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he's protected by both the humans and Demon Night. Even if a Night Group war lord is willing to sacrifice for our sake, it will still be very difficult for him to approach Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"Then let's negotiate!" another war lord suggested.</p>

  <p>"We haven't truly been able to fully control the tower for a while now. Why not just give up a few seats for the humans?"</p>

  <p>"But we don't know how many seats Luo Zheng wants. Maybe� five? Five seats should be enough."</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords were once again engaged in full discussion.</p>

  <p>Maurice, on the other hand, remained silent and closed his eyes. Once the voices died down, he opened his eyes and voiced out his decision, "The Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place have aired their opinions. They've suggested that we negotiate with the human."</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords present couldn't help but roll their eyes.</p>

  <p>If the sacred places had already given their opinions, why did he even bother asking for theirs? Did he have nothing else to do?</p>

  <p>In theory, the sacred places should not be involved in the decision-making activities that happened within the Tower of Sin. The designated seat owners should always have the final say based on their unbiased rationalization. In reality, however, the sacred places served as a foundation for the ogres and effectively controlled the seat owners. Thus, they controlled the matters within the tower.</p>

  <p>"Then let's negotiate!"</p>

  <p>"That brat better not be greedy!"</p>

  <p>"Bah! He wouldn't dare! Even if he controls the power of the tower, the Purple Heart Sacred Place lies outside the Cursed Land. If we work together, we can easily destroy that sacred place," the ogres spoke in confidence. Even if Luo Zheng was granted the power of controlling the Tower of Sin, he would still be powerless in matters outside the Cursed Land. If he displeased the ogres, the Purple Heart Sacred Place could easily become a target of their frustrations.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was in no hurry to advance onto the eleventh floor.</p>

  <p>He entered the tower, not to climb up to the top, but to cultivate and inherit the legacy in the Dark Nether Cave. Staying on the tenth floor would allow him to obtain a large amount of Lucky Light to increase the speed of his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Although he had defeated Boris and Cheryl, there were still a lot of tenth-level war generals who came and challenged him to a fight.</p>

  <p>The tower was littered with many pretentious and delusional warriors.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Boris and Cheryl couldn't defeat Luo Zheng, they would still brush it off and challenge Luo Zheng with hopes that they might miraculously be able to smash him.</p>

  <p>On the first day after they returned, three war generals challenged Luo Zheng and lost. The next day, another three came and were subsequently defeated. On the third day, a war lord actually came to challenge Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was a second-level orc war lord.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, very few creatures in the Sea God Continent reached the war lord level before entering the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The orc war lord seemed to be an independent warrior and did not belong to any orc sacred place. He only focused on cultivation and did not pay much attention to the comings-and-goings of the outside world.</p>

  <p>He had entered the Tower of Sin as a war lord and would usually win through default victories and advance freely on each floor. He wouldn't encounter obstacles until he reached the floor on which Luo Zheng was staying.</p>

  <p>The second-level war lord had challenged Luo Zheng and seemed to be unaware of his deeds. He had managed to advance through default victories from the first to the tenth floor, only staying on each floor for three days.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Zheng, the orc couldn't help but sneer, "A human war general?</p>

  <p>And at the first level? Interesting."</p>

  <p>With full swagger, he walked onto the arena and challenged Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The war lord's challenge piqued the interest of many of the tenth-level war generals. Even Cheryl and Olivia went to the spectator's stand to watch.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng frowned at the sight of the orc challenger.</p>

  <p>The expression on his human opponent's face greatly displeased the orc war lord. "Human boy," he growled, "are you not satisfied with me being your opponent?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am indeed dissatisfied," Luo Zheng answered him bluntly. "You climbed all the way up here without obtaining any Lucky Light."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had stopped on the tenth floor in order to earn the Lucky Light. There was no trace of Lucky Light in the orc's token, which meant Zheng's victory would be useless.</p>

  <p>The orc immediately felt his irritation rise. Zheng's words clearly denoted that he could easily defeat a war lord like him, but the victory would be worthless since he didn't have any Lucky Light. He let out a cold, sinister laugh. "I once had a meal of human meat a few years ago. It tasted very delicious," he snarled. "If I defeat you, I will cut you up and serve myself a stew out of your meat!"</p>
