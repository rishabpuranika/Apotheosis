<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors in the Ice Cloud House and the Swallow Cloud House walked out of their residences and looked at the crimson ring in the sky.</p>

  <p>Some of them were unusually excited, while some of them were obviously dejected.</p>

  <p>Only after passing through the Red Cloud Ring would they qualify to follow the palace leader and participate in Passing the Torch. But not all could pass through the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>In fact, the warriors who joined Mist Palace had good knowledge of their own talents. They knew whether or not they would cross through the ring.</p>

  <p>The excited ones were confident in their skills, while those who stood by gloomily believed that they would never be able to pass through.</p>

  <p>"I have heard that only the warriors who have activated a Lotus Flower of at least five petals qualify to cross the Red Cloud Ring!"</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. In the past, some warriors who had only activated the Three-petal Lotus Flower passed through as well. However, most of those who crossed over were the ones who had activated a Lotus Flower of at least five petals."</p>

  <p>"When I went through the tribulation last year, the Lotus Flower that I manifested only had three petals. Does that mean there is no hope for me?"</p>

  <p>The warriors looked at the ring and whispered among themselves.</p>

  <p>At this time, a figure soared into the sky and flew straight toward the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>"He is Jonah Zhan from Swallow Cloud House! He will no doubt pass through the Red Cloud Ring!"</p>

  <p>Jonah Zhan flew speedily. In the blink of an eye, he arrived before the Red Cloud Ring. Without hesitation, his body gently swished, flashed, and passed through the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment he passed through, the ring released a dazzling scarlet light.</p>

  <p>"What blinding red light! I heard that Jonah Zhan released a Five-petal Lotus Flower a few years ago. Judging from the dense red light, he must have activated a Seven-petal Lotus Flower this time!"</p>

  <p>After Jonah Zhan passed through the ring, he stood behind one of the vice leaders who had brought him into Mist Palace. Jonah Zhan could be considered the vice leader's direct descendant.</p>

  <p>The vice leader smiled briefly, pride evident on his face. At the same time, Jonah Zhan looked haughtily as he stared into a distance below the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>After the first warrior passed through the Red Cloud Ring, the second warrior also rose quickly.</p>

  <p>As this warrior rushed toward the ring and was about to pass through it, the ring suddenly emitted a black light. Soon after, a transparent membrane appeared in the center of the ring, blocking the warrior and preventing him from making his way through.</p>

  <p>"Has he failed to pass?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is a warrior from Ice Cloud House. His talent is inadequate to pass through the Red Cloud Ring!"</p>

  <p>"There are always some warriors in Ice Cloud House who succeed in crossing the ring!"</p>

  <p>The warrior clearly looked disappointed at the failure. Although he found the fact hard to accept and was dejected, he did not dare question the leader of Mist Palace. He could only retreat.</p>

  <p>More warriors began flying toward the Red Cloud Ring in the sky.</p>

  <p>Judging from their flying speeds and momentum, it was easy to guess whether or not they could pass through the Red Cloud Ring. The confident ones flew at full speed, not showing any signs of slowing down. They were most likely to pass through the Red Cloud Ring. Of course, a few overconfident warriors, who were not, in fact, so powerful, also rushed toward the ring at full tilt, only to be directly hurtled back by the membrane and end up being laughed at by the others.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors who slowed down and hesitated, most of them were not able to make their way through the Red Cloud Ring. They were well aware of their own talent and only wanted to give it a try. There were also a few others who thought they would not pass through the Red Cloud Ring but successfully crossed it in the end, making them wild with joy.</p>

  <p>The corners of Zheng's mouth curled up slightly as he looked at the Red Cloud Ring. He was not in a hurry to dash ahead like the others. It would be better to wait until there were fewer warriors left.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, he noticed Layla staring at him. It made him frown.</p>

  <p>The woman gave Zheng the impression of being exceedingly conceited.</p>

  <p>She was also always willing to challenge him. Clearly, she had been waiting for an opportunity to fight him.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Zheng was not too interested in that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>After experiencing the mental predicament, he had long understood what he should do. What he needed was to achieve his goals step by step, not to try and prove something to others. He had already set aside any such desire. It was obvious that Layla had not passed that stage yet.</p>

  <p>"The more lotus petals you have activated, the stronger your reaction to the Lotus Flower and the brighter the light of the Red Cloud Ring," said Layla with a smile. "How many lotus petals have you manifested?"</p>

  <p>Zheng curled his lips and replied, "I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>"You don't want to tell me?" Layla laughed.</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged. He was really unwilling to answer her.</p>

  <p>While the two of them talked, a blue figure flew up into the sky. It was a warrior in blue who was about to give the ring a try. As he flew up, his body emitted a sharp, cold aura.</p>

  <p>"It's Javier Xue!"</p>

  <p>"He ranks first in Swallow Cloud House!"</p>

  <p>"Javier is a warrior who activated the Nine-petal Lotus Flower into full bloom. It is certain that he will pass through the Red Cloud Ring..."</p>

  <p>"I have heard that he is a warrior who ascended from the Lower World!</p>

  <p>He flew into the Upper World six years ago!"</p>

  <p>The instant Javier Xue passed through the Red Cloud Ring, the ring effused an even hotter light. Streaks of light stayed on the ring for a while, lighting up the faces of the warriors in Mist Palace in red.</p>

  <p>Already over a hundred warriors had passed through the Red Cloud Ring. Javier Xue was the one to release the brightest light.</p>

  <p>As he passed through, he smirked and strode toward Yolande.</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled faintly. "Not bad!"</p>

  <p>"It is far from enough," said Javier Xue. "I will prove myself before you in Passing the Torch!"</p>

  <p>Yolande's expression was a little strange, but she said, "Stop it now!"</p>

  <p>However, Javier Xue did not listen to her. "I joined the Mist Palace because of you! I will prove to you that I can be topmost in this era. If only you give me twenty years, I would draw level with you and become just as powerful. By then I will be a good match for you!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, many warriors, including the vice-leaders, were stunned.</p>

  <p>Javier Xue was quite daring to reveal his affection for the leader of Mist Palace before this huge crowd.</p>

  <p>However, the chasm between their cultivation bases was too large. Javier Xue was only at the Soul Sea Realm, while Yolande was almost at the world lord level. The time it took warriors to break through was based on their strength. With the exception of the Demon Night, there were far more male warriors than female ones in other races. Moreover, their strength also exceeded that of female warriors.</p>

  <p>If Javier Xue was truly interested in Yolande, then the first thing he needed to consider was his own cultivation.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Yolande pursed her lips. She uttered in a cold voice,</p>

  <p>"Javier, who you encountered was only a clone produced by the means of my cultivation method! It was just an illusion. Please don't indulge in such a dull daydream!"</p>

  <p>At this reprimand, Javier Xue gritted his teeth and moved to stand behind her. Although he looked disappointed, his eyes still glittered with passion.</p>

  <p>"What is going on with Javier?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard of it? When our palace leader practiced the Soul Split Spell, she divided her soul into a million parts so they could all train in the Lower World. Javier too was a warrior of the Lower World. He fell in love with one of her duplicates!"</p>

  <p>"He is a strange one. Rumor has it that when he ascended to the Upper World, he stayed in a place more than sixty supreme worlds away from our supreme world. It is due to his perseverance and luck that he managed to cross so many supreme worlds and arrive at the Mist Palace."</p>

  <p>"He can be eccentric. No matter where he goes, his talent is impressive enough to be thought highly of by others. As long as he wills it, others have no reason not to keep him at the Mist Palace!"</p>

  <p>"He was infatuated with one of the leader's clones. Now that she has gathered all of her duplicates into herself, it's not the same thing!"</p>

  <p>Astonishment was written all over Zheng's face as he heard the words.</p>

  <p>Comprehension dawned on him soon enough.</p>

  <p>Before flying into the Upper World, Javier Xue had encountered Yolande's duplicate in the Lower World. However, who he met was just her clone. Right now, he was trying to prove his talent and strength in order to pursue Yolande herself.</p>

  <p>It would never work. Zheng shook his head slightly.</p>
