<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A black and white band of light appeared suddenly with a maximum speed.</p>

  <p>When the Supreme Lords finally realized what happened, the band of light had already connected the five Supreme Lords together.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords present stared at it without being able to recover from the surprise it had caused.</p>

  <p>Within the fairy palace, this band of light was released precisely from the pavilion in its center. It was also the Desperate Melee that Luo Zheng had inadvertently triggered when he first went to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Once the living creatures were trapped by it, only one of them would be able to survive.</p>

  <p>"Is this Desperate Melee also effective on the Supreme Lords?" Luo Zheng asked, looking at the band of light outside of the fairy palace. When Luo Zheng had entered the pavilion before, he had been tied up with a group of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors. At that time, the Illuminating Soul Realm warriors weren't able to break free. Would the same happen to the Supreme Lords?</p>

  <p>Saul smiled faintly. "Why wouldn't it work? They are mere Supreme Lords and each of them only bears a Heavenly Destiny, so even they cannot escape its powerful force!"</p>

  <p>"Mere Supreme Lords? Only a Heavenly Destiny? How can you say things like that so easily?" Luo Zheng was shocked with his words. Judging from Saul's tone, he didn't think much of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this Heavenly Destiny is just a Law of Causality in the universe.</p>

  <p>With the rules contained in the Desperate Melee, if this group of Supreme Lords can break free, then they're really amazing." Saul looked extremely relaxed, as if he was not worried if the Supreme Lords would be freed from the Desperate Melee or not.</p>

  <p>The five Supreme Lords that were trapped on the Desperate Melee were Addison from the ogre race, Gunter from the Demon Night, Myles, and other two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords didn't reveal any emotions or show that they were worried about what was happening. Gunter was actually smiling. "This band of light seems to be some sort of restriction. I can feel that it's transmitting an intention. I just can't figure out what it is exactly."</p>

  <p>"I think it wants us to fight among ourselves. And only one of us will survive." Addison was stunned for a moment, and then his face revealed a sneer.</p>

  <p>"This is actually funny!" Myles gently waved his hand and ripples of water appeared on his hand. The water glowed and was about to cut the band of light in half.</p>

  <p>However, as this water glow passed through, the band of light remained the same.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Myles frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords also tried to use their own methods to destroy the band of light, which was only two fingers wide. But it remained intact and seemed to be able to withstand any attack. The five Supreme Lords were still chained to each other.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords started to feel intrigued by this band of light.</p>

  <p>There were too few things that could threaten their lives in this world.</p>

  <p>They were regarded as the invincible ones. They would find a way to be released from it. In the entire universe, the Supreme Lords could kill each other and there were only a few super legendary beasts that could threaten their lives. Except for that, no one could hurt or threaten them.</p>

  <p>But now, no matter what methods they used, the black and white band of light still emitted a faint halo. There were no energy waves being transmitted out or any reaction from it.</p>

  <p>Addison, being the oldest Supreme Lord, was the first one to realize that something was wrong. His figure flashed as he attempted to keep away from the band of light, but the band of light that was connected to his body extended with him, lengthening.</p>

  <p>"The Desperate Melee's desolation is limited to a range of one hundred miles. He can't run away and stay at a distance over one hundred miles away," Saul said as he looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>To a Supreme Lord, a hundred miles was nothing more than a single step.</p>

  <p>When Addison dashed out and was one hundred miles away, a strange thing occurred. A massive force suddenly appeared within the band of light and dragged Addison back.</p>

  <p>Addison was shocked, the uneasy expression stapled on his face. He knew how powerful he was. If he were to unleash his full strength, his fist could easily shatter a star.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, no matter how much he tried, he was unable to travel one hundred miles.</p>

  <p>After he was dragged back, he breathed for a moment before both of his eyes once again widened. An extremely frightening power once again erupted from within his body.</p>

  <p>This force was enough to crush half of a supreme world.</p>

  <p>However, when he rushed out of the range of one hundred miles, he was still dragged back.</p>

  <p>In this Desperate Melee, one hundred miles became the Law of Causality of these five Supreme Lords. It was even stronger than the Law of Causality. It was impossible for them to go against it and escape.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the remaining four Supreme Lords became frustrated.</p>

  <p>Gunter, Myles, and the other two Supreme Lords were similarly walking in different directions.</p>

  <p>The same thing happened to them.</p>

  <p>One hundred miles was a range that none of them would be able to reach.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>The five Supreme Lords gathered once again. They could see the shock on each other's face.</p>

  <p>They carried the Heavenly Destiny which represented the highest Law of Causality in the universe. However, this band of light had already surpassed them. It was beyond their knowledge and imagination. All of them wondered what kind of power it was.</p>

  <p>"If you want to undo this black and white band of light, you need to kill each other. Only one of you can survive," said Luo Zheng, his voice spreading all over the universe again.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's voice was heard, it shocked many of the living creatures in the universe.</p>

  <p>Earlier, trillions of living creatures in the universe were clear that many Supreme Lords seemed to have surrounded Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Many warriors sighed with emotion and wondered who on earth Luo Zheng was. He was only at the Soul Sea Realm, but he could attract so many Supreme Lords to surround him. Those warriors thought that if they could become as powerful as Luo Zheng and attract so many Supreme Lords, it would be worth it even if they were killed by the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>But now they started to be a bit at a loss when they heard Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"What did he mean?</p>

  <p>Let the five Supreme Lords kill each other?" "What does he mean that only one of them can survive?"</p>

  <p>"How did Luo Zheng do that?"</p>

  <p>Within the Mist Palace, when Yolande heard Zheng's words, she immediately took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was trapped this time, Yolande did not try to help him.</p>

  <p>She never expected that after she let Luo Zheng go out for training, he would be able to find a Crown of Destiny and actually provoke dozens of Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>If these dozens of Supreme Lords were to gather together, they would probably be able to destroy the whole alliance she was in.</p>

  <p>She wasn't capable of helping Luo Zheng once again. All she could do was to wait.</p>

  <p>She had never seen anyone who could cause so much trouble. If Luo Zheng provoked some Spirit Transformation Realm warriors or even world lords, she would not hesitate to help Luo Zheng out. But now he was besieged by dozens of Supreme Lords, so she could not do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Now hearing Zheng's voice, Yolande was stunned again. 'What did he mean?' she thought.</p>

  <p>'Only one of the five Supreme Lords can survive? He wants to kill four Supreme Lords in one go?</p>

  <p>How did he make it so far?'</p>

  <p>After Yolande cultivated the Soul Split Spell, her mind had become much stronger than that of the ordinary world lord. When the warrior's cultivation of martial arts reached the extremes, training the mind was even more important than cultivating the martial arts. However, at this moment, Yolande's mind was like a tide, churning and rolling, unable to calm down.</p>

  <p>Yolande wasn't the only one who was so astonished.</p>

  <p>Many warriors who had heard of his name were confused about him.</p>

  <p>Those warriors included Master Shen and Master He from the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, Lincoln who stayed in the Dark World, as well as the talents of the Mist Palace, such as Javier and Layla.</p>

  <p>They looked up to Zheng's terrifying talent. They still regarded him as a Soul Sea Realm warrior. If he was just slightly stronger than them, they could still accept that.</p>

  <p>However, it had only been about half a year, and Luo Zheng was already able to go against Supreme Lords. Judging from Zheng's tone of voice, it seemed like he was going to kill the four Supreme Lords without mercy.</p>

  <p>They were not the ordinary warriors, but four Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>There were only a few Supreme Lords in the alliance.</p>

  <p>"What is Luo Zheng doing?"</p>

  <p>Layla was standing on a star in the Western Sky Region. Purple ice crystals were scattered around her, and it was hard to tell what she was thinking.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who she had once regarded as her greatest opponent, had grown to be so powerful in such a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>The polar region of the star was a perfect place to cultivate and gain experience. It was her master, Kyron, who had personally brought her up here. At this time, Kyron had also descended by Layla's side, and he was looking towards the Middle Sky Region. His face was also filled with surprise as he said, "He shouldn't be relying on his own strength. Perhaps he has some sort of trick up his sleeve. The Illusion Battlefield will begin in just a few years. Layla, you should focus on your cultivation."</p>
