<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1490 Drag More Supreme Lords In </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Right now, the fairy palace was Luo Zheng and Xun's last shelter.</p>

  <p>If the fairy palace was destroyed, Luo Zheng would have no choice but to accept his fate.</p>

  <p>Now that he was facing so many Supreme Lords as well as Yao, he seemed to have fallen into a deathtrap. However, he didn't mind making the situation more complicated if it meant that he could find a way out.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, he took out the Roaring Token. A moment later, Zheng's voice resounded throughout the entire universe.</p>

  <p>"Hi bitch, we meet again!"</p>

  <p>When Yao heard Zheng's words, a trace of anger blossomed in her icy gaze.</p>

  <p>'How dare he insult me!' she thought.</p>

  <p>As an exalted queen of the Demon Night, how could she tolerate a mere Soul Sea Realm warrior humiliating her?</p>

  <p>However, her face was still calm. She said coldly, "In my eyes, you're just a nobody. A Soul Sea Realm warrior doesn't have the qualifications to even talk to me. Let Xun out!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng opened his mouth again.</p>

  <p>"Humph! In my eyes, you aren't even a queen of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>You're just a bitch. You want us to come out? Not a chance. Why don't you come in if you're powerful enough? There are many treasures in this fairy palace. Other than the Crown of Destiny, there is also my Roaring Token. This thing should be something that surpasses the heavens, right?</p>

  <p>It has limitless use."</p>

  <p>Zheng's words shocked all the intelligent creatures in the 100, 000 supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>"A Soul Sea Realm warrior has a Crown of Destiny?"</p>

  <p>"According to the legends, a Crown of Destiny is what allows a world lord to become a Supreme Lord. But now, it has been obtained by a mere Soul Sea Realm warrior."</p>

  <p>"If I have this Crown of Destiny, I can become a Supreme Lord!"</p>

  <p>All around the universe, warriors at a low cultivation level just said whatever they pleased. The truth was, if this Crown of Destiny truly fell into their hands, it would just be a hot potato. They wouldn't gain anything out of it. In fact, they might even lose their lives.</p>

  <p>However, some of the world lords were immediately envious.</p>

  <p>Every supreme world in the universe had a world lord, with the exception of a few extremely barren and harsh supreme worlds. Some supreme worlds even had two to three world-lord level warriors, such as the Dark World and the Spirit Reading World.</p>

  <p>When these world lords heard Zheng's words, they immediately wanted to obtain this Crown of Destiny as well.</p>

  <p>They had already reached the peak of their cultivation path.</p>

  <p>The only way they could take a step further was to obtain a Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>They couldn't understand how it had been obtained by a mere Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>"Bring that Crown of Destiny here!" "I'll ask my grandpa to obtain the Crown of Destiny for me."</p>

  <p>"Where is this brat now?"</p>

  <p>Some ordinary world lords could do nothing about it, but there were other world lords who had powerful forces backing them. Some of them were even the children or personal disciples of Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Although 128 Supreme Lords had already known about the Crown of Destiny in Zheng's possession, many of them hadn't been intending to take any action due to various reasons.</p>

  <p>But now that the news of the Crown of Destiny had spread throughout the entire universe to all races and all living beings, the situation had changed. "The brat's Roaring Token can actually be used an infinite number of times!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't this too exaggerated? Who in the universe could create such a Roaring Token? I don't believe it!"</p>

  <p>"You have to believe it. Do you remember how many times this brat has already used the Roaring Token? Even Supreme Lords would not casually use a Roaring Token. It's too difficult to obtain one in the first place. Where did that brat get so many Roaring Tokens?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's mention of the Roaring Token had shaken the universe almost as much as his possession of the Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>A Roaring Token was something that even Supreme Lords had to pay attention to.</p>

  <p>Yao's frown deepened when she heard Zheng's words. 'What is this guy trying to do?' she thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng put down the Roaring Token and turned to Xun with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What star is this?"</p>

  <p>Xun thought for a moment, and then said, "This is the twelfth star in the Middle Sky Region. I think it's called Yellow Sand Star." There were many stars in the sky, and although her memory was extraordinary, she wasn't too sure about her answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng activated the Roaring Token once more and said, "This is truly an honor. On the Yellow Sand Star, the twelfth star in the Middle Sky Region, several Supreme Lords have gathered in front of me. I wonder if there will be even more Supreme Lords descending here. I'm honored to be able to witness so many Supreme Lords!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng spread these words to the entire universe through the Roaring Token, the expressions on the faces of the Supreme Lords on the Yellow Sand Star changed several times.</p>

  <p>"This brat wants to drag more people in!"</p>

  <p>"He is trying to attract even more Supreme Lords. Ha-ha, he's quite clever."</p>

  <p>"No, he's too childish. This move is useless."</p>

  <p>The gazes of several Supreme Lords had traces of admiration while other Supreme Lords had expressions of disdain.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of these Supreme Lords, the young man hiding in the fairy palace was facing certain death today. They thought that the reason he was trying to attract even more Supreme Lords was because he wanted to complicate things and take the first opportunity he got to run away.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, this move of Zheng's might be useful. But there were several Supreme Lords here. No matter how complicated the situation became, Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to escape under their watchful eyes.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Luo Zheng had still made the move. Not only had he thrown out the bait, but he had also accurately exposed his position.</p>

  <p>In fact, exposing his location was just a superfluous move. After all, it wasn't difficult for any Supreme Lord to figure out the position of the Crown of Destiny. The key was that Luo Zheng had successfully let everyone know about the Crown of Destiny as well as the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the universe would want to obtain those treasures.</p>

  <p>Most of the 128 Supreme Lords belonged to great races. There were only a very small number of strange Supreme Lords that were all alone and didn't belong to any great races at all.</p>

  <p>Before this, many of the Supreme Lords had maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Since they had already become Supreme Lords, they had no intention of fighting for Zheng's Crown of Destiny. After all, there was great risk in doing so and almost nothing to gain from it. But now, they were faced with their own descendants and children begging them for help.</p>

  <p>Soon some of the Supreme Lords that hadn't made a move yet began to head toward the Middle Sky Region.</p>

  <p>This included even Supreme Lord Myles and Supreme Lord Amritpal.</p>

  <p>These two Supreme Lords not only aimed for the Crown of Destiny, but also the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Both of them had been ridiculed by Luo Zheng using the Roaring Token. They had been confused about why this mysterious youth had so many Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>But now, they had heard Luo Zheng personally admitting that his Roaring Token was something that surpassed the heavens. They were both shocked and convinced. They had no desire to obtain the Crown of Destiny, but they wanted to obtain the Roaring Token no matter what.</p>

  <p>As a result, more and more Supreme Lords began to leave their own supreme worlds and head toward the Middle Sky Region.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I was wrong," Yao said with a cold smile. When she had just discovered Luo Zheng, she should have personally gone to the Dark World instead of dragging things out and sending people to exterminate him.</p>

  <p>That had wasted a large amount of time.</p>

  <p>If not for this, she would probably have taken away the Crown of Destiny and Xun's life a long time ago.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had disclosed his possession of the Crown of Destiny and the Roaring Token to attract even more Supreme Lords, the situation had become a little tricky. He could cut a deal with a top-rank Supreme Lord and exchange the Crown of Destiny for a guarantee of his safety.</p>

  <p>Since the situation was complicated, it was beneficial for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Yao no longer had any hesitation. As the Faith Energy filled her body, the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hands began to emit over 10, 000 bolts of lightning.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Her attack was about to smash straight down upon the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>However, just as Yao made her move, Supreme Lord Addison's black smoke rapidly spread over. He had been the first Supreme Lord to arrive, and with his tyrannical personality of an ogre, how could he give up his prey? dozens of giant hands made of black smoke grabbed at the fairy palace from different directions.</p>

  <p>However, just as Supreme Lord Addison moved, countless tiny shadows erupted from Supreme Lord Gunter's body. Each shadow was only the size of a palm, but they contained a unique Law of Causality that seemed to completely melt away anything that touched them. The black smoke hands of Supreme Lord Addison were no exception. In the blink of an eye, they had completely melted away.</p>

  <p>However, even though Supreme Lord Gunter had blocked one of the Supreme Lords, he was unable to stop the remaining five Supreme Lords. All of them came over at almost the same time. They couldn't stand aside and let someone else take the Crown of Destiny.</p>
