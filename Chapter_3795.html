</p>

  <p>Zheng even reached out to touch his body.</p>

  <p>The "statue" that sat upright was exactly the same as his own corporeal body, though it didn't move of course.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, is this just a statue?" Zheng asked, slightly hesitant and overtaken with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the Primeval Lord of Heaven, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Then what is this? Is it my real body? How could that be?" Zheng asked, even more taken by what he saw.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a faint knowing smile.</p>

  <p>As the most wise and knowledgeable human being, he had a deep understanding of Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore as well as of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"Think of it as an anchor," he said. "Let's call it a sort of anchor body!"</p>

  <p>"An anchor you say?"</p>

  <p>Zheng stared pensively.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed with a smile. "Think of us as a ship drifting. This anchor body fixes us here so we can receive power from external areas, namely, the power of the Eternal Realm..."</p>

  <p>"The power of the Eternal Realm?" Zheng's eyes glinted.</p>

  <p>Of course, he knew that Eternal Warriors of the Eternal Realm were very powerful, but he hadn't understood why.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven recognized Zheng's confusion. Suddenly, he asked, "In your opinion, is there any difference between the bloodline of Sun Crows and the bloodlines of the ferocious beasts in the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"The bloodline of Sun Crows and the bloodlines of ferocious beasts..." Zheng frowned and thought for a while. "I think the difference is probably in their strength. Although the ferocious beasts are also capable of inheriting bloodlines, theirs won't increase their own strength very much, but the bloodline of Sun Crows is different."</p>

  <p>"Then have you ever thought about why their blood power is so strong?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, smiling once more.</p>

  <p>Creatures in the Source World could summon such great power because they relied on the Other Shore Tokens on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, this rule was broken by blood power.</p>

  <p>When Emperor Charm had used the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy or Eastern Emperor Taiyi had used the golden sword, their power hadn't come from any Other Shore Token, but their own bloodlines.</p>

  <p>"So how can they unleash such power without using any Other Shore Token?" With the Primeval Lord of Heaven's hints, Zheng now understood.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, you mean... the Eternal Scroll Painting? They have obtained their bloodlines from the Eternal Scroll Painting!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had been wondering how Emperor Charm's and Eastern Emperor Taiyi's blood power could be so strong. So strong they were able to destroy a whole province with ease. Obviously, their blood power was much more powerful than Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>But both Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm were powerful seniors; Zheng had thought perhaps they had used means he did not know of, so he hadn't thought too deeply about this question.</p>

  <p>But the Primeval Lord of Heaven's reminders helped Zheng figure it out quickly.</p>

  <p>"The Three Purities Stone is an anchor that binds your real body here, so that at the same time, you may enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and obtain your own bloodline. The other end of your bloodline is connected to somewhere in the distant Abstruse Energy World..." explained the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"No wonder there is a vortex in both Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword and Emperor Charm's suns!" Zheng said, nodding excitedly at this new found revelation.</p>

  <p>The power of the Abstruse Energy World was connected to the Eternal Scroll Painting, and the power of the Eternal Scroll Painting was connected to the statues in the Three Purities Stones. The statues were like anchors, closely connected to the Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>"The blood power can be inherited, so the children of these powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm have it too..." Zheng appeared confused again.</p>

  <p>Putting himself aside, Yan had also obtained the Snake Goddess' bloodline through the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, and could now use the shadow of Snake Goddess as an energy entity.</p>

  <p>Although Yan's shadow of Snake Goddess couldn't be compared with the actual Snake Goddess, she at least possessed the blood power.</p>

  <p>"All creatures with the same bloodline have an invisible line that connects them to that powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven began. "Therefore, using the Blood Splitting Technique, you can, quite ingeniously, kill all people with the same bloodline in a region, by relying on that invisible line."</p>

  <p>Zheng abruptly raised his eyebrows at the very mention of the Blood Splitting Technique.</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race in the divine land had been killed by the Yellow Emperor Guards using the Blood Splitting Technique. It was not until then that Zheng had learned of the Blood Splitting Technique.</p>

  <p>"The Eternal Scroll Painting is not the only way to obtain the power of the Abstruse Energy World, is it?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, all kinds of power could come from the Abstruse Energy World, but the power obtained through the Eternal Scroll Painting was far stronger than any ordinary power. Generally speaking, as long as some power was obtained through the Eternal Scroll Painting, it could reveal the "vortex" that was connected to the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied. "The Chaotic Source Spirits in your body is another way, just in the reverse direction? There are also some Other Shore Tokens in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore that can achieve a similar effect."</p>

  <p>"If that's the case and I enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, will I obtain a new bloodline?" Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>He already had two bloodlines in his body.</p>

  <p>One was the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline, and the other was Chiyou's. If he entered the Eternal Realm in the Eternal Scroll Painting, he would obtain a third bloodline and he thought that would be too many for him.</p>

  <p>"Once you obtain a new bloodline, Chiyou's bloodline will disappear from your body," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said matter-of-factly. "Back in the times of the 77th civilization, Ziya entered the Eternal Realm and my bloodline was removed from his body."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know a bloodline could be replaced in the Eternal Scroll Painting."</p>

  <p>Zheng became looking forward to obtaining his blood power in the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>When he withdrew from the second volume, he saw a group of an Other Shore race coming over from not far off. They were almost the same as humans, except for the third eye on their foreheads.</p>

  <p>The man who led them possessed an extremely powerful aura, no weaker than Eastern Emperor Taiyi or Yasamin. It was obvious he was a powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>When Pearce and the others caught sight of them, they immediately walked up to them with smiles strewn across their faces. Bowing to the powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm, Pearce said, "Chief, seeing as you're leading your clansmen here in person, it must mean the Three Eyes race is not lacking in young talents!"</p>

  <p>In Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, most races submitted to the Element Spirit race, while others were under the protection of the Nihility race. However, in addition to these two camps, there were also other races that maintained a neutral position.</p>

  <p>In fact, these neutral races all pretty much agreed with the Finale Way, and were thus potential allies of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill. That was the reason for Pearce's politeness.</p>

  <p>The chief nodded slightly, turned and waved his hand. "This time, there will be three members of our Three Eyes race entering the Eternal Scroll Painting. Of course I hope they can enter the Eternal Realm."</p>

  <p>His wave signaled the three members, who stood out from the rest of the group one at a time.</p>

  <p>The one walking in the front was the shortest and looked like a child.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at him for quite a while before he finally realized who he was.</p>

  <p>He was the three-eyed boy he had met in the Dark Region in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But this was not the Dark Region. As a creature in the Dark Region, how could the three-eyed boy have entered the Light Region?</p>
