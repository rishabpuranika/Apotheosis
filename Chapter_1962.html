<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1962 Return To The Immortal Mansion </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Originally, Maha had planned on using the Great Dominance Technique in order to force Luo Luo Zheng into submitting to him.</p>

  <p>What he hadn't taken into consideration was the possibility that he would be reproved and taught a lesson by Luo Luo Zheng. Furthermore, Luo Zheng's words had even aroused the populations' common hatred in the Evolutionary Universe!</p>

  <p>Maha's face grew long as he listened the roars coming from the universe.</p>

  <p>Maha led the Sacred martial artists to slaughter humans through the entire process, completely suppressing the human morale. Following such, the Demon Night's rebellion had been a fatal blow to the human race. Although the ogre race had interfered at that point in time, the three human forces still suffered from low morale.</p>

  <p>Now though, thanks to Luo Zheng's horrendous words, Maha's previous efforts seemed to have been in vain.</p>

  <p>"Don't let him utter another word," Maha coldly ordered. This time, he didn't want the responsibility of having to stop Luo Luo Zheng on his own.</p>

  <p>Although he had failed to subdue Luo Luo Zheng with the Great Dominance Technique, there was no reason to say he couldn't eventually control him.</p>

  <p>In fact, there were several different methods for enslaving a martial artist.</p>

  <p>For all Maha cared, it didn't matter how eloquent Luo Luo Zheng was, and there was no way he would escape his grasp. The two Sacred Supreme Lords behind Maha had long since had this same intention, and secretly criticized Maha in their minds. Both of them believed that Maha shouldn't engage in so much conversation with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In a certain way, they were right, too. Now, Maha couldn't seem to get the upper hand on this argument. Even worse, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to retort with ease and just like that, Maha found himself at a disadvantage. In the eyes of the two Sacred Supreme Lords, it was better for Maha to catch Luo Luo Zheng directly and enslave him at once. By then, Luo Luo Zheng would no longer be anywhere capable of resisting.</p>

  <p>And because Luo Luo Zheng was trapped in the Seven Ultimate World, he could be compared to a piece of meat on the chopping block. It would be easy for them to catch and kill him.</p>

  <p>As Maha gave the order, Supreme Lord Noel of the Sacred race reached out his hand in a first attempt to grab Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His arm was like a long fish as it instantly pierced through space, appearing beside Luo Luo Zheng and clawing at his head!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was actually extremely vigilant, though. Before Maha had even given the order, he had already activated the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>With the release of a blazing white stream from the power of space, Luo Luo Zheng was capable of escaping hundreds of miles away in the blink of an eye, avoiding Supreme Lord Noel's grasp.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can escape?" Supreme Lord Noel uttered calmly.</p>

  <p>It was too late. He had already left an imprint on Luo Zheng's body. No matter where Luo Luo Zheng moved from now on, Supreme Lord Noel would be able to detect him in an instant.</p>

  <p>Through his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng looked like a little sheep running on the plains.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast he tried to move, he couldn't escape the falcons' pursuit. Supreme Lord Noel thought he could let Luo Luo Zheng run away as fast as possible, let him waste his energy first, and then catch him after he fell into despair.</p>

  <p>Maha, Connie, and Supreme Lord Barrie also thought the same. Thus, while the three of them watched Luo Luo Zheng escape, they equally looked calm, their faces expressionless.</p>

  <p>Just as Supreme Lord Noel was about to use his spatial transference to chase after Luo Luo Zheng, he was suddenly stunned. His eyes quickly revealed a deep feeling of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Maha, who held Connie in his arms, was calming his mind and thinking about how to deal with Luo Luo Zheng. He thought that after he had completely enslaved Luo Luo Zheng, he would be able to use Luo Zheng's Godly Genius identity to suppress the human race. Besides that, Luo Luo Zheng seemed to be a deep source of surprises and secrets.</p>

  <p>'The Roaring Token in that guy's hand seems to be a strange item that can be used repeatedly. So interesting...'</p>

  <p>Although Maha was deep in his thoughts, he couldn't help but notice Supreme Lord Noel's expression. Out of curiosity, he asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"He has disappeared..." Supreme Lord Noel's expression looked everything but natural. His features were distorting themselves.</p>

  <p>"What?" Maha questioned in a shocked tone, his complexion suddenly changing to a pale, washed out hue.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Barrie, who had remained silent up until now, was just as surprised. He immediately released his perception, and everything within one thousand miles appeared in his mind!</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord's perception was extremely strong. It was impossible for any living creature within one thousand miles to escape such detection.</p>

  <p>"He really has disappeared," Supreme Lord Barrie uttered with disbelief.</p>

  <p>He had quickly come to the realization that Supreme Lord Noel was right. Luo Luo Zheng had truly disappeared.</p>

  <p>"That is the place where he was last seen!" Supreme Lord Noel suddenly pronounced before he frowned anew, and his figure disappeared from its original place immediately.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Barrie also seemed to have sensed that something was amiss and instantly activated the Grand Teleportation technique too.</p>

  <p>Perhaps all hope wasn't lost.</p>

  <p>On a small hill a hundred miles away from the southern side of Ultimate Immortal City, there was a small mini Immortal Mansion that was in the process of appearing.</p>

  <p>In mid-air, the Immortal Mansion slowly rotated. It looked extremely exquisite, as though it was a toy constructed by a nimble craftsman.</p>

  <p>As the two Supreme Lords, Maha, and the other Sacred martial artists moved in that direction, they couldn't help but take notice of this small Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>"Is it a space treasure?" Maha's lips curved upward, his face revealing a trace of ridicule.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's breath literally just disappeared from this place, seconds ago. He must have entered this Immortal Mansion," Supreme Lord Noel said, as he stared at the Immortal Mansion which continued rotating slowly, almost obnoxiously.</p>

  <p>Maha nodded his head in a single gesture. After seeing this Immortal Mansion, he breathed a sigh of despair.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had really run away right before their very eyes, then they had brought shame upon themselves!</p>

  <p>Moreover, Maha knew that Murphy's primary goal was to capture these Godly Geniuses!</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng really did run away, then even Maha was likely to face a very severe punishment.</p>

  <p>"Come out, Luo Luo Zheng. It's meaningless to hide inside. I didn't expect you to be the cowardly type," Maha said, indifferently. A mere space treasure wasn't even worth Maha's attention.</p>

  <p>The mini Immortal Mansion didn't reply. Instead, it only continued slowly rotating in the same spot.</p>

  <p>Maha pointed his finger at the palace and instructed, "Break this space treasure."</p>

  <p>"This little Immortal Mansion is really quite exquisite. After forcing Luo Luo Zheng out of it, do you think I can have it, perhaps?" Connie stared at the Immortal Mansion, eyes wide with interest.</p>

  <p>Maha gently stroked Connie's cheek and chuckled. "Of course you can have it."</p>

  <p>That was when Supreme Lord Noel's gaze fell upon the Immortal Mansion. He suddenly extended both his hands forward, grabbing onto the tiny Immortal Mansion. He released a terrifying, unexpected bout of power!</p>

  <p>"Nether Divine Kill!"</p>

  <p>Streams of Space Law's white power formed a small space tornado in his hand, enveloping the mini Immortal Mansion whole.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Noel immediately imagined how this space killing skill could instantly mince the Immortal Mansion into tiny pieces!</p>

  <p>The spiraling tornado continued its attack. However, it didn't seem to have any effect on the Immortal Mansion. In fact, the palace didn't even budge at all.</p>

  <p>"Huh? What's going on here?" Another expression of surprise was now exposed on Supreme Lord Noel's face.</p>

  <p>Maha glanced at Supreme Lord Noel indifferently and suddenly, Supreme Lord Noel began to feel embarrassed. He was a Supreme Lord, but even he was unable of breaking through a tiny space treasure. In other words, he felt like a complete disgrace.</p>

  <p>"Grand Divine Cutting!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Noel shouted fiercely this time. He tried his best at attacking the Immortal Mansion. He focused on cultivating the Space Law because its power was truly formidable!</p>

  <p>Several transparent space sabers immediately appeared around the Immortal Mansion. At once, these sabers started stabbing and lancing at the Immortal Mansion in an attempt to destroy it.</p>

  <p>Clang! Bang! Bam!</p>

  <p>As the space sabers slashed down with great force, a series of loud sounds could be heard.</p>

  <p>After about thirty seconds...</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Noel, Supreme Lord Barrie, Maha, Connie, and the world lords of the Sacred race were all staring at each other, their eyes wide.</p>

  <p>Everyone's face displayed an astonished, shocked and confused expression.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, they hadn't thought much of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the space treasure was, its defensive power was still limited. If a Supreme Lord were to take action to attack it, it would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Clearly though, they had underestimated this Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Ten years ago, this very same expression had had appeared on the faces of many Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe...</p>

  <p>"Is it fun?" Luo Zheng's voice roared throughout the universe and transmitted, reaching and booming into Maha's and the others' ears. "If you want to capture me, you'll first have to see if you have the qualifications to break through this space treasure!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng's words, many of the Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe couldn't help but break out in laughter!</p>

  <p>It was clear to them that Luo Luo Zheng had entered that Immortal Mansion again.</p>

  <p>From the start, they hadn't worried about Luo Zheng's safety whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Together, they had personally witnessed the toughness of this Immortal Mansion. In the past, many Supreme Lords had given everything they could against it, but they simply couldn't destroy it. In the end, a few of them had been killed by the Desperate Melee...</p>

  <p>"You brat, you..."</p>

  <p>Maha felt like he was going crazy.</p>

  <p>Where did Luo Luo Zheng find such a magical space treasure?</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Barrie, go forth and destroy this space treasure!" Maha ordered.</p>

  <p>"At once!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Barrie specialized in studying all kinds of poisons, and the Heavenly Destiny he carried was the Life Law!</p>

  <p>In terms of killing technique, Supreme Lord Barrie was extremely proficient in it. However, the destructive power he created was inferior to Supreme Lord Noel's. Now though, since Maha had already asked him to make a move, he would still give it a try.</p>

  <p>He quickly stretched out his hands, causing his arms to turn black with traces of phosphorescence.</p>

  <p>This phosphorescence was a poison that boosted his strength, capable of turning his hands into a pair of all-conquering toxic weapon in a short amount of time!</p>

  <p>The venomous hands grabbed the Immortal Mansion, and suddenly began emitting a wild, savage power as they kneaded and pulsed at the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A crushing sound could be heard. His greatest desire at that moment was to forcibly break open the Immortal Mansion with his two hands!</p>

  <p>However, the Immortal Mansion didn't give. Not even an inch. It continued spinning, at its own casual speed, in front of them.</p>

  <p>"This..." A look of bleak awkwardness appeared on Supreme Lord Barrie's face. He was also beginning to understand and sympathize with Supreme Lord Noel's predicament.</p>
