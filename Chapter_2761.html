<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2761 Going Into The Water </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Sword Chen was an extremely talented character in the Evolutionary Universe. Not many outranked him, and very few ever would.</p>

  <p>Since he was capable of escaping to the Abyss Demon Region, it was safe to assume that his cultivation level couldn't have been very weak at the time.</p>

  <p>Despite everything, at least he was a top-rank or even a consummate True God!</p>

  <p>It didn't matter. The Abyss Demon Region was known to be very dangerous, and it didn't make any exceptions for anyone.</p>

  <p>Even if he was a Demi-holy Being or Holy Being, he simply couldn't survive in the Abyss Demon Region, let alone the fact that he was merely a consummate True God at most.</p>

  <p>After all, he had never been to the Mountain of Holy Beings. In other words, it was completely impossible for him to become a Holy Being through cultivating on his own. It would take much more than that.</p>

  <p>One after the next, many ideas flashed through Zheng's mind. He could see them, but he couldn't confirm any of them.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, countless black, thin lines all came out from the deep, dark water at once.</p>

  <p>The black thin lines moved at an extremely fast speed, like long, skinny hairs. They rolled toward Samuel and Zheng, who were both surprised.</p>

  <p>Anyone who was caught by the black thin lines would be cut straight in half.</p>

  <p>Despite his fear, with the Spear of Supreme Harmony in his hands, Samuel dodged the black thin lines with ease.</p>

  <p>The black thin lines had a single, very clear purpose: to force Samuel into backing up.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still, utterly motionless, and yet, all the thin lines flew around him without even touching him.</p>

  <p>"Come down now!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Samuel was forced backward, a voice was suddenly transmitted into Zheng's head through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation, Zheng's body began to sink.</p>

  <p>Although he had Latent Theurgies at his access, he would avoid their use as long as he possibly could.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng had descended extremely quickly, but there was no way Samuel would let him off the hook that easily.</p>

  <p>Once again, the Spear of Supreme Harmony in Samuel's hand slashed out violently. Swish, swish, swish, swish! The spear slashed through the air.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Spear of Supreme Harmony transformed itself into countless spear shadows that pierced straight into the void.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced below him and he saw the spear shadows penetrating up toward him. He knew he was in a dangerous position.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Samuel took a confident step forward, bypassed the black thin lines with a few side steps, and suddenly appeared directly above Zheng.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng could use the Eight Smoky Melodies to perfectly dodge his spear attack, and therefore, for the entire round of attack, he never let his guard down - not even once.</p>

  <p>While Zheng attempted to walk out of the void, Samuel shot down the sky above.</p>

  <p>An incredibly strong force suddenly pressed down on him from above, while underneath him, countless spear shadows from the Spear of Supreme Harmony were rushing upward.</p>

  <p>Beneath such absurd pressure, even if Zheng used the Eight Smoky Melodies, his body would still be pressed onto the spear's tip and the spear shadows would thus shoot through him.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter if someone comes to your rescue now. If he helps you, he'll simply die too." A cold expression appeared on Samuel's face, as his lips curled into an unpleasant smile.</p>

  <p>The attack that rose from beneath the black water took Samuel by absolute surprise.</p>

  <p>Although it was quite a fierce attack, it still wasn't enough to frighten Samuel into backing out.</p>

  <p>In fact, he thought to himself, after killing Zheng, he just might fight with the fellow under the black water!</p>

  <p>In spite of the strain being placed on him, Zheng turned himself around and smiled faintly at Samuel above. "It seems that you have a bad memory."</p>

  <p>Perhaps Samuel didn't think very highly of Zheng, and he thus seemed to have forgotten what Zheng was truly capable of.</p>

  <p>As he noticed the calm expression on Zheng's face, Samuel became suspicious. Could he really have forgotten certain details about Zheng?</p>

  <p>Even more importantly, the pair of black eyes out in the black water also appeared anxious all of a sudden. What was going on?</p>

  <p>He had been hiding under the black water for so many years now. His strength had greatly advanced of course, and he had also mastered a few extremely powerful methods.</p>

  <p>Under the current circumstances, however, he was unable to save Zheng, even if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>The only way he'd even come close to helping him was if Zheng could descend into the black water.</p>

  <p>The spear shadows were unbelievably dense though, and this caused a high risk for Zheng. The spear could impale and heavily damage his body.</p>

  <p>As the pair of black eyes and Samuel both stared Zheng down, blood began to spurt from Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, his legs, waist, head, and abdomen were equally bleeding freely.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Blood kept streaming down his body in pulses, following the rhythm of his heart.</p>

  <p>Disappointment revealed itself in the pair of black eyes and something occurred to Samuel.</p>

  <p>Every single wound that had appeared on Zheng's body had disappeared in an instant. It was like an optical illusion that never really existed, and Samuel and the black eyes were only witnesses to the scene.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Samuel waved his arm high in the air again and activated the Spear of Supreme Harmony at once, in an attempt to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was just too late. Nothing could be done.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Zheng dove into the black water with a splash.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng was deep beneath the black water's surface, a countless number of spear shadows had landed on the water's surface.</p>

  <p>Had it been any other ordinary area of water, the stabs from Samuel's spear would have been more than enough to cause raging waves that pierced all the way to the bottom.</p>

  <p>In fact, dozens of stabs were more than enough to turn over an entire sea.</p>

  <p>Each time his spear pierced into the black water, however, it was like a sticky glue, causing nothing more than a few faint, weak ripples.</p>

  <p>As he continued to stab and press downward, a strange force spread into the black water. It was as if the force was fighting Samuel for the spear!</p>

  <p>Every time he thrust his spear into the thick, glue-like water, the force coming from below would double.</p>

  <p>With the last few stabs, the force seemed to have grown even stronger than Samuel's. He knew he couldn't continue in such a way.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances, Samuel had no choice but to give up stabbing into the black water. Otherwise, his Spear of Supreme Harmony would be taken away by the invisible force before he could even kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>That said, Zheng now knew his secret, which would pose serious problems for the future.</p>

  <p>Samuel hovered above the black water for a while, and then coldly shouted,</p>

  <p>"Don't ever let me see you in the Abyss Demon Region again! If you show up, I'll kill you. Trust me!"</p>

  <p>Every inch of the black water suddenly looked like a tormenting dead pool of blackness.</p>

  <p>If people were to use their spiritual sense in order to cover the black water with an area of hundreds of thousands of miles, they would find that the surface of the black water was absolutely calm and without any waves. It was extremely weird. Nothing of the sort had ever been seen in other places.</p>

  <p>Probing deeper with the spiritual sense was therefore impossible.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the spiritual sense really was, the black water would swallow it whole as soon as it came into contact with its chillingly dangerous waves.</p>

  <p>Samuel, on his behalf, had equally noticed the black water's problem. He had no desire to stay here any longer. He tossed the Spear of Supreme Harmony lightly.</p>

  <p>Once the long black spear was well hidden in the void, Samuel retreated to the west of the black water.</p>

  <p>In the black water, something strange was happening.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt himself being dragged downward, as though a hand had clasped tightly around his ankle.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a dried voice sounded out from below him. "What's your name?" the voice asked.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, both sides had already guessed at each other's identities.</p>

  <p>Now, it was time to verify their hypothesis.</p>

  <p>"My name is  Zheng Luo," Zheng stated in a flat tone.</p>

  <p>As he spoke his name aloud, the hand that held onto him suddenly trembled. The man's voice asked back, "Do you come from the Evolutionary Universe?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, a smile now plastered on his face, "Are you Sword Chen, the Killing Sword Mountain's master?"</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, Sword Chen was actually Zheng's master. After all, he had learned the Gods-intimidating Strike from him.</p>

  <p>For a short while, the man kept silent, and then burst out laughing. His laughter was full of life and joy, as though the depression that had overwhelmed him for countless years had finally disappeared with the snap of his fingers.</p>

  <p>"It seems that after all these years, I've finally got something in return," the man mumbled.</p>
