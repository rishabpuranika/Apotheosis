<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 186 Attack Of The Demons (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Small chunks of rubble fell down the lower floors as quick footsteps rushed up the stony steps of the staircase. Zheng, leading other disciples from Cloud Sect, climbed a side staircase to reach the rooftop in the barracks. When they reached their destination, the horrific view that greeted them stunned their group into silence.</p>

  <p>The once clear sky was now dominated by swirls of dark, thick clouds and smoky fog.</p>

  <p>In the distance, they could see an increasing mass of dark figures that had started to climb up the city's walls. They were demon generals and soldiers, who swarmed almost all the sides of the city wall like an incoming tide.</p>

  <p>To make the dreadful scene even worse, black human-shaped demon birds with gigantic scaly wings emerged. They circled around in the air, each of them armed with black long bows and arrows.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of the hideous demon birds carried demon generals and soldiers in their huge talons. Upon reaching the periphery of White Emperor City, the demon birds released the demon soldiers along with the demon generals from their grip, dropping them into the city.</p>

  <p>The horrifying horde of demons in the sky weren't even the main forces of the opponent's massive army. They were only used as a prelude to make way for the truly formidable demons.</p>

  <p>Back then, during the more peaceful times, the Heaven and Earth towers had prevented war from breaking out in White Emperor City for many years. However, when the demons unexpectedly occupied the two towers, they immediately planned and executed a direct attack at White Emperor City in such a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>"Swash! Swash! Swash!" the loud flapping of the demon birds' scaly wings rippled through the dark atmosphere.</p>

  <p>They proceeded to aim their arrows at the disciples of Cloud Sect who stood on the rooftop barracks after spotting them.</p>

  <p>With their long bows aimed at their targets, the demons' black arrows rained down on the rooftop.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the pointed tips of the arrows weren't that sharp, so all of the disciples were able to fend them off with their skills.</p>

  <p>The most direct forms of defenses came from Zheng. When the arrows came near, he pointed his finger at them and released a great amount of power which crushed the arrows.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Cleve wielded a sword that released a strong beam of silver light that formed a protective shield around him. The silver light from the sword was so powerful that it cut and repelled all the arrows aimed at him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lenard handled black and white swords in his hands. The two swords gave off their respective powers as he expertly used them in combat.</p>

  <p>The black and white intents of the swords not only resisted all the attacks of the opponent's arrows. They also spiraled upwards and struck back at the demon birds. Unfortunately, when the dual colored sword intents shot up in the sky, the demon birds had already dodged the attacks as they flew at an altitude too high in the air.</p>

  <p>The resistance efforts of Cloud Sect's disciples were also aided by strong attacks from the highly capable imperial army of White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>In comparison to the disciple's efforts, however, the counterattacks from the imperial army proved to be much stronger and more effective.</p>

  <p>Down the chaotic streets of the city, the imperial army had lined up firing catapults that were loaded full with arrows.</p>

  <p>The firing catapult was invented by the ingenious Zhu family. It was later promoted throughout the imperial army and eventually became one of the most efficient weapons for defending the city.</p>

  <p>On a rooftop not far from where Zheng was, three soldiers from the imperial army had set up a brightly colored firing catapult. The two of them attached a long arrow to its tip, while the other soldier violently shook its grip to stretch the bowstring behind the machine to its maximum limit.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!" The sound erupted as they abruptly released the bowstring, making the deadly arrow shoot up to the sky.</p>

  <p>The lethal arrow soared up more and became a tiny speck in the air, until it landed on its target.</p>

  <p>Eventually, a loud boom was heard in the distance.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the arrow had hit a demon bird and upon contact, it immediately exploded into smithereens. The demon bird let out a shrill cry and helplessly flapped the remnants of its charred wings as it burned in flames like a huge fireball. The burnt mass continued to combust and then finally fell down to the ground.</p>

  <p>The army continued to fire the arrows into the air while huge balls of exploding flames burnt in succession like fireworks in a festival.</p>

  <p>But the demon birds fought back as well by mercilessly dropping the demon generals and soldiers in their talons down to the firing catapults with great precision.</p>

  <p>From the rooftop, Zheng looked up and saw a dark figure swoop down and smash a gaping hole into the opposite rooftop. A tall figure suddenly emerged out of the hole which turned out to be a demon general. As soon as he got out, his steely eyes transfixed on the nearby firing catapult and the three soldiers who operated it, making it clear that he was set out to destroy the catapult.</p>

  <p id="top">The emergence of the demon general also caught the attention of the other Cloud Sect disciples. However, no one could beat him except for Lenard. So in that moment, no one else dared to stop or fight him.</p>

  <p>The fear and hesitance of the army's side were palpable in the air, which prompted Zheng to attach one of the two small rings that Master Su gave him on the hilt of his broken knife. Mustering his strength, he jumped from one rooftop to the next.</p>

  <p>The three soldiers who manned the catapult turned white as sheet due to extreme fright upon seeing the approaching enemy.</p>

  <p>They were the most ordinary soldiers, with their strength at the marrow refining level. They could fend off the demon soldiers with all their might, but they were next to nothing when faced against a demon general. One encounter would be enough to get them killed.</p>

  <p>However, military orders strictly prevented them from holding back.</p>

  <p>There was a saying among the imperial army, which was "as long as he is alive, the operator must ensure that the firing catapult is not destroyed." Being in the army demanded their whole being to obey the strict order.</p>

  <p>If one gave up the firing catapult and ran for his life, a more grueling punishment awaited him. Then again, their sense of honor as imperial soldiers did not allow them to escape.</p>

  <p>The demon general drew closer and closer back on the scene. Two of the soldiers frantically continued to work around the firing catapult, while the other unsheathed his sword and summoned all the courage and strength that he could muster to face the demon general.</p>

  <p>Even the small praying mantis could dare to stop a raging chariot, and it was the same for the imperial army who fought against the demons in White Emperor City all the year round. The ordinary soldier, despite being at the marrow refining level, was able to contain his fear and resist the demon's frightful aura. He pushed back his thoughts in his head and drew out his sword with shaky hands to confront the demon general.</p>
