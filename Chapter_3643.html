  <p>
</p>

  <p>If those Corpse Spirit Sun Crows had owners present, it would be impossible for Emperor Charm to steal them.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Zheng stole the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, he had to drive the demon women of the Divine Lair away from them or directly burn them to death with blue flames.</p>

  <p>Since Elizabeth sat firmly on the last Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's back, Zheng couldn't take it away.</p>

  <p>However, she suddenly left the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow in the last minute.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it wasn't that far, so Zheng had a chance to steal it.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>While Elizabeth fell from the sky, Zheng immediately entered the Sky Net with all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>At that point, he had taken away all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows led by Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's wings were quite strong. As a result, she didn't manage to stabilize herself in the air until she had dropped down sharply for a certain distance.</p>

  <p>Once she was back to her senses, she looked closely at Zheng and saw that he had already fled to the inside of the Sky Net with all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng didn't leave right after he had entered the Sky Net. Instead, he flashed her a smile and shouted across the Sky Net, "To be honest, I'm interested in fighting with you."</p>

  <p>Although he hadn't climbed up to a higher stage of the Other Shore Realm yet, there wasn't a big difference between him and powerful warriors like Elizabeth and Athemar when it came to the Soul of Light, corporeal body, and the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"Now," Elizabeth said seriously.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were full of hatred, as if she wanted to eat Zheng alive.</p>

  <p>"Not now," Zheng answered with a grin.</p>

  <p>He clearly wasn't like Athemar or Pearce, who had more access to information because of their higher positions.</p>

  <p>But even without thinking, he could tell that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were by no means the only weapon of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>Since Elizabeth and her army alone were able to make the seven mountains remain inside the Sky Net, the leaders of the seven mountains, the Oneness Governors, and other powerful warriors must be afraid of something— though he didn't have the chance to know what that was yet.</p>

  <p>Still, he inadvertently got involved as he controlled nearly a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth's pupils continuously dilated as she stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Blue wisps of fire appeared on her crimson golden wings. The originally loose flame feathers turned into blue short swords, and at the same time, her aura surged.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's aura spread out.</p>

  <p>Within three seconds, it had spread to hundreds of miles around it.</p>

  <p>At the twelve passes on both sides of the Sky Net, including the Mountain Sea Pass, the Battle Rage Pass, the Heavenly Wind Pass, the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and warriors of the Other Shore Realm were all fighting against the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, each pass was only responsible for the area in front of them.</p>

  <p>Chaim, the Evil God, and the others were all assigned to the twelve passes.</p>

  <p>They led many Oneness Guards to a fierce battle against the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh…"</p>

  <p>When the powerful aura swept like a windstorm, both the Sun Crows and the humans who were in a fight, froze and simultaneously looked in the same direction.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, the Evil God had guarded the Heavenly Wind Pass.</p>

  <p>Without Zheng by his side, he was much more relaxed and he no longer felt restrained.</p>

  <p>The first time he arrived at the Heavenly Wind Pass, he had enraged several Oneness Generals to the point that they almost battled each other. When the Evil God remembered that Zheng was behind him, he restrained his impulse to fight.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it wasn't long before the Oneness Generals in the Heavenly Wind Pass were finally impressed with his powerful strength. In a short period of time, he had led the warriors to repel several rounds of attacks from the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>That was why he was very surprised when he felt that strange aura and said,</p>

  <p>"Is there such a powerful existence among these poor birds?"</p>

  <p>He was so intrigued that he was even itching to leave the battlefront at the Heavenly Wind Pass, just so he could find out and see what kind of being gave out such an aura.</p>

  <p>Just then, a long sound of horns suddenly came from within the Heavenly Wind Pass.</p>

  <p>It was a sound that signaled them to retreat.</p>

  <p>The Evil God frowned at the sound. He hadn't been tired of killing yet today, so he didn't want to retreat so soon.</p>

  <p>He still wanted to fight more, but to the warriors of the Other Shore Realm who were pushed out like livestock, the blare of the horns was like the sweet sound of nature that gave them a life-saving straw.</p>

  <p>"Retreat! We will be safe once we are within the Sky Net!"</p>

  <p>Gant floated in mid-air with three red swords by his side.</p>

  <p>As a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect, he was summoned to the Heavenly Wind Pass. In addition, he had the same status as a Oneness Guard.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace led by Monica, such as Beldene and Elgin, were in a worse situation. Despite their considerable talent, it was too short a time since they had joined the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Due to their current skill set, it was hard for them to be promoted to the Oneness Guards in less than a hundred years, let alone join the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Judging from their strength, they would suffer a lot of damage in the battle against the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Gant had borrowed a powerful sword from his race before he set out. He and Monica tried their best to protect the disciples of the Sword Light Palace. Many of their people were injured, but only a few had died, which could be considered a miracle in their situation.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>"I can finally go back!"</p>

  <p>"God bless me!"</p>

  <p>All the humans quickly retreated to the inside of the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>It turned out that it was Pearce who had given the order.</p>

  <p>The battle had reached the second phase, and the twelve passes had accomplished their mission.</p>

  <p>And the Oneness Guards in the twelve passes were not qualified to take part in the following battle.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Sky Net couldn't block the aura Elizabeth released.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood right in front of her so of course, he received the aura's impact from all directions.</p>

  <p>If his Soul of Light hadn't reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, he would have suffered serious damage.</p>

  <p>"What kind of skill is this? She became much stronger!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It's the Dream Blood Theurgy," replied Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"She will have a desperate fight," he added. "A desperate fight? Can she tear the Sky Net apart?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think she'll be able to tear it apart," Emperor Charm glanced at the Sky Net and answered.</p>

  <p>The Dream Blood Theurgy was a theurgy that only Emperor Charm himself could bestow upon someone, and it could greatly stimulate one's own potential.</p>

  <p>In the 77th chaos, he had only granted it to no more than a hundred demon women.</p>

  <p>Then again, the Sky Net could endure the continuous attacks of more than a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. Even if Elizabeth's strength increased by ten times, it still wasn't enough to tear such a powerful array apart.</p>

  <p>Zheng had planned to run away, but he changed his mind after he heard the answer from Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Although Elizabeth had activated the Dream Blood Theurgy, it was true that she wasn't in a hurry to attack him.</p>

  <p>After all, she knew that it was in vain, and she only did such a thing to release her emotions.</p>

  <p>She did it for the people behind her to see. "Is this your strategy, Springer?</p>

  <p>It's so ridiculous..." she said through life vitality.</p>

  <p>As she spoke, her voice echoed in a space behind her.</p>

  <p>That particular space was quite strange that it fell in the category of cognitive zones.</p>

  <p>To be precise, the space existed, but it did not exist.</p>

  <p>Because she believed that the space existed, it floated behind her.</p>

  <p>As for the others like Zheng, Pearce, Athemar, the Oneness Generals, and the Oneness Guards, they didn't know the existence of that space. Thus, for them, it did not exist.</p>
