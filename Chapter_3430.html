<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Not only did Mount have a remarkable space theurgy, but also had enough strength to make the Evil God fear him.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God did not hesitate. In fact, the more threatening something was, the more he wanted to go for it.</p>

  <p>Originally, he wanted to give Zheng the fatal blow while waiting in the shadows.</p>

  <p>But at this point, he had no idea where Zheng was sent away. Luckily, Mount had the special space ability, which made him a fine target.</p>

  <p>If the Evil God could somehow obtain a similar mystical space theurgy, he would be powerful beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>As Mount's power was restrained by Chaim's abacus, the Evil God saw this as the perfect opportunity.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, he snuck around behind a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, which allowed him to appear right behind Mount after he used teleportation.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a heinous laugh, a ray of black light shone in the Evil God's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Just like that, the black light in his eyes began to extend, forming slender four-legged snakes. The creatures began to twist and intertwine themselves around Mount, keeping him captive.</p>

  <p>Mount showed no panic, but his face did express a sense of irritation.</p>

  <p>He tried to wave his arms around, flailing them just to get rid of the snakes.</p>

  <p>But they were strong and securely wrapped around him, so there was nothing he could do.</p>

  <p>It came to a point where his Other Shore Power had come close to none.</p>

  <p>His physical strength only reached dozens of divine megatons, making it nearly impossible to break free from the snakes.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>After thinking hard, he realized he could not use power in this situation. He had to come up with another means of escape.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, Mount's figure began to slowly disappear, as he used the Grand Teleportation technique to escape.</p>

  <p>But he failed as the snakes had a unique energy attribute. They had the ability to attach themselves so firmly onto his body that he couldn't even move into the space!</p>

  <p>"You can't escape..." The Evil God chuckled, enjoying as he watched Mount struggle.</p>

  <p>Though the Evil God taunted, Mount paid no attention to him. Suddenly, a cube began to emerge from the pupil of his eye, growing until it enveloped him, the snakes and the Evil God into a dimension.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Mount was able to move away now, but he took the Evil God with him!</p>

  <p>The next moment, both of them were up in the air at ten thousand feet, descending rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God did not have time to process what was happening. Just now, he successfully captured Mount, but at this moment, he was being dragged down by Mount!</p>

  <p>Even after he had escaped, Mount still couldn't make use of the Other Shore Power. His weight and physical strength were no match for the Evil God's power. The Evil God tugged the snakes, and he stopped midair.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God was able to hover, Mount saw this as an opportunity and he created enough space and moved them again.</p>

  <p>Just after that, Evil God saw a foot making its way towards him. It was the foot of no other than the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, members of the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mouse race and the other races were battling with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, so they were all very surprised when they saw Mount and the Evil God suddenly appear.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was disappointed that he didn't see this coming. It never occurred to him that Mount would use the mother to his own advantage.</p>

  <p>So naturally, the sight of the huge foot took the Evil God by surprise.</p>

  <p>And even though the mother moved slowly, her strength was notably destructive. Even the light shields of the arrays got crushed just with her stomp. As terrifying as the mother could be, even the Evil God couldn't resist her.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God wasted no time and dragged Mount away.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, the mother landed on the ground, creating a gaping crater on the surface.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the Evil God was able to drag Mount away from the foot, the space before him shook and changed. He and Mount ended up appearing under the other foot of the mother!</p>

  <p>At first, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had grown irritable. But upon seeing the Evil God and Mount moving around her feet, she did not hesitate to crush them.</p>

  <p>She trod down with her giant foot, aiming for the two warriors beneath her.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God moved away quickly, dragging Mount with him. "Do you want to die with me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mount looked at him unafraid, and answered calmly, "If I wanted that, I would have used the Grand Teleportation technique right when the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits trampled down."</p>

  <p>If Mount teleported them when the foot of the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits was only a few feet above the ground, the two of them would be crushed into pieces. No matter how fast the Evil God moved, there was no escaping the mother!</p>

  <p>"This Is just a warning," Mount said. "Let go of me now, or I swear we will die together!"</p>

  <p>Mount would not die and did not give too much value on his own life, but the Evil God would die.</p>

  <p>In the face of death, he remained unperturbed and did his best to get himself out of this predicament.</p>

  <p>And even though the Evil God was extremely arrogant, he feared death just like everyone else.</p>

  <p>The last thing he wanted to do was getting dragged by Mount to their tragic deaths. The next moment he would definitely let go of Mount to avoid being dragged to death. This was the judgment of Mount.</p>

  <p>But Mount was wrong.</p>

  <p>"You really think so?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the black light flashed in Evil God's eyes and began to spread out again.</p>

  <p>"Thump, thump, thump..."</p>

  <p>And just then, the place was swept with a deafening silence.</p>

  <p>Everyone heard their own heartbeat.</p>

  <p>As the color of the surroundings began to change, the black smog became white and yellow rocks became dark blue.</p>

  <p>The skin that was snow-white began to darken, while the dim sky began to shine the blazing white light.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Run away right now! Don't be distracted!"</p>

  <p>People were panicking, wondering what in the world was going on. One of the members of the Separate Abyss race grew so distracted that he was crushed by the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>As Mount noticed the altering atmosphere, his pupils shrunk and his expression changed. "A world has descended... Which civilization gave it to you?"</p>

  <p>He turned towards the Evil God, who narrowed his eyes at the question.</p>

  <p>"You really have a sharp eye, don't you?" The Evil God smirked. "You can even see that a civilization is behind me!"</p>

  <p>In fact, there were still many civilizations remaining on the Other Shore. At this point, every ruling civilization had come to an agreement: only the chosen spokesperson of the civilization had the ability to descend a world.</p>

  <p>And the rules in this kind of world would be redefined.</p>

  <p>However, some civilizations were stronger than others. This meant that some worlds that descended were also stronger than others.</p>

  <p>For example, the blood-red world brought by the Bright Mountain's leader was not powerful, because the civilization behind him could not be considered a ruling one.</p>

  <p>"Even if you let a new world descend, you would not be able to do anything to me!" As soon as the words left his mouth, Mount enclosed himself and the Evil God in a cube once again.</p>

  <p>This time, he made sure to use the space theurgy accurately, moving towards the edge of the foot of the mother. He hovered the Evil God right under the foot, threatening him with a sudden death. Should the foot step on the cube, the Evil God would not be able to dodge it.</p>

  <p>However, when the Evil God was thrown in, he flashed his body, employing the Grand Teleportation technique to move away from the cube and into the air. He looked down at Mount and grinned. "It is indeed a wonderful thing, your space theurgy." He chuckled. "Quite convenient. I can't wait to have it..."</p>

  <p>After the Evil God finished speaking, his arms trembled and crimson energy radiated form his body. It formed an outline, a huge figure of energy, which was the shadow of Snake Goddess!</p>
