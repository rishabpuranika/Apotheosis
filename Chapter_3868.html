  <p>
</p>

  <p>A space which was thirty miles wide, thirty miles high, and thirty miles long had been deleted from the chaos and exiled into the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>On all sides, everything squeezed into the gap to fill in the disappeared space. The ground itself was pulled up. A majestic mountain, thirty miles high, appeared out of thin air.</p>

  <p>The last time, Luo Zheng had quickly returned after Mount exiled him. This attracted Othniel's attention.</p>

  <p>The outside world thought that the Land of Ashes? also known as the Deleting Space? was controlled by Othniel. In fact, he couldn't affect anything in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>The information left by the Sons of Truth on the Other Shore seemed to indicate that the Deleting Space was under the control of Othniel. But much had changed over the past few hundred chaotic eras. The Deleting Space had undergone a dramatic transformation, and Othniel had lost control of it.</p>

  <p>He didn't know for certain what had happened inside.</p>

  <p>All he knew was that he had the ability to exile people and things into the Deleting Space. However, he had no power to delete the creatures and things within that space.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's safe return from the Deleting Space had shaken Othniel. He immediately tried to invade the Deleting Space to reclaim his authority over it.</p>

  <p>None of Othniel's attempts to regain control was successful.</p>

  <p>Othniel had always felt that something strange was in the Deleting Space, something that he could not track or detect. It was a sore spot in his heart.</p>

  <p>In this case, Othniel would not have chosen to delete the man in black unless he had no other choice. After all, it might prove ineffective.</p>

  <p>However, since the man in black had been deleted, Othniel seized this opportunity to take Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>The man in black frowned as he floated in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>He raised a hand to pat his head, muttering, "I was too careless. I forgot this trick."</p>

  <p>It was not a good thing for him to be exiled to this damned place.</p>

  <p>He had come with the help of the Descending Ring, but now the Descending Ring had grown dim. He had lost contact with the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>What if he was truly trapped in this cursed space, unable to find his way out? It would cause enormous problems for the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>As he floated, the man in black suddenly realized the strangeness of his situation. "Shouldn't the things in the Deleting Space be completely destroyed? Why is this place..."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, after some time, he noticed something visible in the distance. He squinted. It seemed to be a vast, endless, floating wasteland.</p>

  <p>He stared at this unexpected sight, feeling more confused than ever. His eyes widened when he saw two figures flying in his direction. One was Ziya, and the other was Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>At first the man in black doubted if it was truly Ziya. But when he confirmed the truth of Ziya's identity, twin flames began burning in his eyes.</p>

  <p>When he was facing Othniel, a powerful Chaos Ancient God, he had managed to act cool and collected, as though nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>But when he saw Ziya, the man in black could no longer restrain the anger that had burned in his heart for countless years. His gaze was filled with killing intent.</p>

  <p>A low buzz sounded as he attacked.</p>

  <p>He tapped the Cyan Misty Sword, and a thin ray of cyan light shot towards Ziya.</p>

  <p>Not long after Ziya and Luo Nian returned, a loud noise could be heard coming from the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>This was a common occurrence, so Ziya didn't take it seriously. He brought Luo Nian directly there to see what was going on.</p>

  <p>But before he had even noticed the man in black, he saw the extremely sharp and deadly ray of cyan light rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed when he sensed the power of the cyan light. He instantly waved his hand, and a golden whip lashed out like a poisonous dragon at the ray of cyan light.</p>

  <p>The golden and cyan lights converged in midair. Ziya waved his golden whip, forming many small spirals, and soon the cyan light was swallowed up.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian hung back, watching the attack and counterattack with surprise.</p>

  <p>He had always considered Ziya to be much stronger than his father.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that he was powerless in the Abstruse Energy World, Ziya had never met an opponent in the chaos. He had a grim look on his face that Luo Nian had not seen before.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian caught sight of the man in black and wondered who he was. Why had he initiated a fight with Ziya as soon as he arrived, without even speaking to him first?</p>

  <p>But the fight was not over.</p>

  <p>Rays of cyan light shot out from afar, and some of them headed straight for Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Ziya's face turned cold. His lips formed a sneer as he raised the golden whip in his hand and flicked it, causing a loud explosion in midair. The whip reformed into an arc of bright golden light which lashed towards the cyan rays.</p>

  <p>The previously invincible cyan lights seemed fragile compared to the golden lights.</p>

  <p>Every time a golden light bloomed, a cyan ray was drawn away, turning into a cyan lotus that slowly dissipated into space.</p>

  <p>The cyan rays blasted towards Ziya one after another, and he lashed out at each one with his golden whip.</p>

  <p>In the span of a few seconds, thirty-six rays of golden light bloomed, and thirty-six cyan lotuses appeared and dissipated.</p>

  <p>The fierce clash of energy was a spectacular, dazzling scene. Luo Nian watched with great fascination. He knew that although the colorful bursts of energy were beautiful, they were also terrifying. A single ray of light could kill him instantly.</p>

  <p>His estimation of Ziya rose, and he now believed more than ever that Ziya was immensely powerful.</p>

  <p>Although all his attacks had been dispersed, the man in black seemed undaunted. He raised his Cyan Misty Sword once more. Six black flags appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>Thin black energy lines flowed on the surface of each flag.</p>

  <p>These were known as the Six Soul Flags.</p>

  <p>Ziya raised an eyebrow. He called out, "Are you really planning to fight me to the death, uncle?"</p>

  <p>The Cyan Misty Sword trembled in the man's hand. He drew a circle from top to bottom with himself at the center. Although there was no wind, the Six Soul Flags fluttered, and a mysterious and indescribable aura spread out from his body. He shouted back, "You have the cheek to call me uncle?"</p>

  <p>Again, a buzz signaled his impending attack.</p>

  <p>The black energy emanated by the Six Soul Flags suddenly flowed inward, gathering on the surface of the Cyan Misty Sword. The cyan glow of the sword intersected with the black energy, and the sword began to burn.</p>

  <p>Raising his sword, the man in black rushed towards Ziya.</p>

  <p>Ziya gently pushed Luo Nian, and an unseen force propelled Luo Nian away.</p>

  <p>In the face of such a powerful attack, he had no time to protect Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>"Let bygones be bygones. Why do you still keep the past in mind?" Ziya said, lifting his own golden whip once more.</p>

  <p>Ziya's God Lashing Whip had been created by the Primeval Lord of Heaven with Ziya's root-level bloodline. It was his most powerful weapon.</p>

  <p>"Your master has said the same thing many times," the man in black said coldly. "It is nonsense!"</p>

  <p>He was the Grandmaster of Heaven whom Luo Zheng had met.</p>

  <p>He and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had learned from the same master, so he was Ziya's uncle.</p>

  <p>At first, Ziya had not known if he was still alive. After all, when the 77th chaos ended, Ziya had been exiled to the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Ziya didn't know anything about what happened later on the Other Shore until Luo Zheng took him out from the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Although Ziya had grown much since those days, he still found it deeply unsettling that the mere sight of him had spurred the Grandmaster of Heaven to an immediate fight to the death.</p>
