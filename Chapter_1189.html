<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>People belonging to the four divine kingdoms knew everything about the corpses in those coffins. They had spent years investigating them thoroughly in order to control the corpses.</p>

  <p>It wasn't an easy task, learning the corpses' names and retaining them.</p>

  <p>Given the names weren't hard to remember, fusing their souls with the corpses caused the corpses to instinctively reject them.</p>

  <p>And being interrogated by the girl who was sealed in the stone pillar would cause the memories in their souls to become confused, making it hard for them to remember the names of the corpses.</p>

  <p>War King Wind had once succeeded in saying the correct name. But he couldn't remember how he had managed to do it and his success had been the only one in all these years.</p>

  <p>When the masters of the Soul Sea Realm opened the coffin, they saw a thin old man lying within it. This man was Henk Feng, the one they had spoken of.</p>

  <p>War King Wind's soul entered the old man's corpse through his mouth.</p>

  <p>Not long after, his soul merged with Henk's corpse and controlled it such that it slowly climbed out of the coffin.</p>

  <p>But the corpse seemed to be rejecting War King Wind's soul rather strongly. As War King Wind controlled the corpse, trying to make it walk, it staggered like a drunken man and involuntarily moved towards the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>The following moments were most crucial. Only by saying the right name of the corpse could he escape control of the girl in the pillar. Since Scott had already failed, they thought that the chances of War King Wind succeeding were slim.</p>

  <p>As expected, the corpse's face twisted under the girl's interrogation, as if in pain. It shook severely, trying and failing to speak out the name,</p>

  <p>"Henk Feng."</p>

  <p>He ended up facing the same fate as Scott. The soul was forcefully ejected out by the mysterious girl in the pillar.</p>

  <p>War King Wind was dejected and it showed on his face. But he didn't go to the twelfth floor to choose a corpse, like Scott had done. Instead, he fell into deep thought, wanting to try once again.</p>

  <p>But War Emperor York and Turner were in no hurry to give it a try. They walked around the coffins and tried to think of a good solution.</p>

  <p>In the past, the people of the four divine kingdoms couldn't take even a single step into the Feather Emperor Secret Land, the Divine Emperor Secret Land and the Mysterious Dream Secret Land, let alone the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. After years of scouting, they gradually found ways of entering the first three secret lands. If they could find a way to easily obtain the corpses of the ancient warriors at the top floor, they would be able to explore the whole Heavenly Stellar Secret Land some day.</p>

  <p>But the four divine kingdoms hadn't come up with any method to solve this problem.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he watched the three emperors hesitate.</p>

  <p>As Turner had pointed out, this was indeed a matter of names. If they could clearly say the right names of the corpses in front of the girl, they would be able to obtain the corpses.</p>

  <p>Was it really that difficult to speak out a few words?</p>

  <p>War King Wind and Scott had repeatedly memorized the names. It was impossible for them to forget the names and there were others on the sidelines who constantly reminded them. But despite all that, they had failed to say the right names.</p>

  <p>"Names!"</p>

  <p>An idea suddenly occurred to Luo Zheng, and his eyes flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>He walked up to a coffin.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, do you also want to give it a try?" Turner asked.</p>

  <p>Most Soul Sea Realm masters also looked at Luo Zheng. Although his cultivation base wasn't high, his abilities couldn't be measured with common sense. Maybe he could think up a good solution.</p>

  <p>As this thought crossed their minds, they became excited. One of them said to Luo Zheng, "The owner of this coffin is called Federico Feng. He was the most powerful warrior among the Dragon Lineage Humans.</p>

  <p>According to the information we've got, he was born with superhuman strength."</p>

  <p>"Federico Feng... Federico Feng..." Luo Zheng repeated the name twice to himself.</p>

  <p>"Shall we help you open the coffin now?" another warrior at the Soul Sea Realm asked.</p>

  <p>"Please wait a moment," Luo Zheng replied. He did not choose to open the coffin and occupy Federico's corpse directly. Instead, he returned to the side of the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>"What is Tianxing trying to do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. I don't understand..."</p>

  <p>"It looks like he wants to carve something on the stone pillar. Could it be that he wants to carve the name of the corpse on it? But that will not work!"</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm had left no stone unturned in order to occupy the corpses on that floor. Some of them had tried to carve the names on the pillar before. But they hadn't been able to remember the names irrespective of whether others whispered the names to them or whether the names were carved into the wall.</p>

  <p>Standing beside the stone pillar, Luo Zheng stretched out a finger and transformed it into a sharp shape. With a light wave of his finger, he began to carve words onto the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>He was carving the name 'Federico Feng' on the pillar, but indirectly. He was using the letters that spelt the name.</p>

  <p>The names of the Dragon Lineage Human were still written in the human language. Luo Zheng believed that even if he couldn't remember the name directly, he could at least record the words by spelling them out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng carved the letters one by one onto the stone pillar. He then returned to coffin and smiled as he said, "Alright, I'm ready now!"</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm warriors were surprised at Zheng's actions but didn't say anything. They wanted to see if Zheng's plan would succeed. If it worked, they could follow suit afterwards.</p>

  <p>So they broke the rune on the coffin and opened it.</p>

  <p>The coffin was a little longer than the others. It revealed a burly man lying within it, two huge gold axes lying beside the body.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Luo Zheng took his space ring from his finger and placed it beside the coffin. The space ring was very important to him, which was why he had taken it with his soul instead of leaving it with his body.</p>

  <p>Once the preparations had been made, Zheng's soul rushed towards the burly man's corpse. He opened the burly man's mouth like the others had done and entered the corpse through the mouth.</p>

  <p>Soon, his soul settled in so that it felt like it had reached the body's brain.</p>

  <p>But the moment he tried to merge his soul into the corpse, he felt a strong force of expulsion.</p>

  <p>Usually, warriors had to destroy their opponents' souls if they wanted to steal their body shells.</p>

  <p>This warrior called Federico had died many years ago. His soul had already disappeared or had entered Samsara. This meant that Luo Zheng wasn't stealing his body shell but was simply obtaining his corpse.</p>

  <p>However, when a warrior cultivated to such a high level, an unchangeable power still remained within his body even if he had been dead for many years.</p>

  <p>And because of this, even if some powerful warriors passed away in the wilderness, no wild beasts would dare approach their corpses.</p>

  <p>The powerful repelling force within the corpse was driving Zheng's soul out of it. If it had been an ordinary Fighting Soul, it might have been instantly driven out of the corpse's brain.</p>

  <p>That was why most Soul Sea Realm warriors of the four divine kingdoms had chosen the corpses of the eleventh and twelfth floors.</p>

  <p>They knew that it was too difficult for their souls to obtain the corpses of the thirteen floor.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was much stronger than that of a normal Soul Sea Realm warrior and even the four emperors, not to mention that he had fused with the will of the great world. His soul ignored the repulsive force and directly occupied the brain.</p>

  <p>However, even though his soul had merged with the brain, he was still unable to control the corpse. He had to wait for the Soul Core's power to spread and fuse with the corpse.</p>

  <p>Streams of grey light surged through the man's body. After a few seconds, Luo Zheng gradually regained some of his senses, finally feeling his limbs again. He soon felt that he could control this corpse as his own.</p>

  <p>"Get up!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to rise from the coffin. But it was a little harder than he thought. As he made to stand up, he tottered unsteadily on his feet and fell back into the coffin.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's movements looked funny, no one laughed at him. With his current age and cultivation base, it was his pride and joy to be able to obtain this corpse.</p>

  <p>Few moments later, Luo Zheng jumped up smoothly to his feet. His burly body was like a steel tower as he firmly stood on the ground. His eyes were the size of saucers as he opened them and looked around.</p>
