<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Peng!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng got close to the basaltic men, he pulled out his sword.</p>

  <p>"Flick the sword!"</p>

  <p>The great might of the Blood Drinking Sword was brought out and shot toward the stone man's head. As the sword intent spread through the stone man's head, its brain shattered. However, on the surface of the stone man, only interwoven cracks like a cobweb could be seen.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng pulled back his sword, and the stone man tumbled down to the ground and crumbled into small pieces of basalt.</p>

  <p>"Flick the sword!"</p>

  <p>"Flick the sword!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't stop after killing the first stone man. In the blink of an eye, three stone men made of basalt disintegrated under Luo Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>Astonished by Luo Zheng's performance, the cultivator with the white face didn't realize that he would be the loser until Luo Luo Zheng had destroyed the third stone man.</p>

  <p>Surely, the cultivator with the white face knew the rules of the magic array.</p>

  <p>The killing of beasts would add points to promote their small tower to a higher one. For example, in the last round of attack, the killing of the crow zombies would add ten thousand points, which would help promote the small tower to the fourth level. And the ten thousand points were just the right amount, no more or no less, or the tower couldn't be promoted.</p>

  <p>In this round of attack, there were 200 stone men and killing one stone man meant getting 175 points. So, if somebody could kill all the stone men, he would get 15, 000 points, which meant that the next promotion of the tower level would require 15, 000 points.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng had already killed three stone men made of basalt, which meant that Luo Luo Zheng was ahead by more than 500 points. In other words, after the fifth killing competition, he couldn't promote his tower level, because his points were not enough.</p>

  <p>The cultivator with the white face was furious.</p>

  <p>He hadn't bothered Luo Luo Zheng, but Luo Luo Zheng seemed to be causing trouble!</p>

  <p>"No matter who you are, I will kill you! If I can't kill you in the magic array, I will kill you at Oracle City." The cultivator with the white face gnashed his teeth. His expression was full of fury, and his face turned as red as pork liver.</p>

  <p>After killing three stone men made of basalt, Luo Luo Zheng raised his sword before his chest. Then he noticed the cultivator with the white face. Luo Luo Zheng greeted him, "Wow! It's you! Great!"</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng felt guilty before he saw the cultivator with the white face because he knew it was improper to kill beasts in someone else's field. Luo Luo Zheng knew that the warrior couldn't promote his tower level as his points would be insufficient if he killed his targets.</p>

  <p>When the small tower was promoted to the highest level, it would be terribly mighty. If he didn't get enough points to earn the promotion, then the warrior would have to face severe consequences.</p>

  <p>However, after knowing that the stone men belonged to the cultivator with the white face, Luo Zheng's guilt vanished. He dodged the slow blow from the stone man made of basalt behind him. Luo Luo Zheng quickly riveted and stepped on the massive arms of the stone man. In a flash, he jumped and stabbed his sword into the stone man's head. He flicked the sword again!</p>

  <p>"You dared to steal my stone men!"</p>

  <p>The cultivator's white face filled with beams of black light, like little worms. A dark light also shone in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The cultivator with the white face was not good at physical attacks, but that didn't mean he was weak.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to kill an entire sect. Even though the sect he had exterminated was much weaker than Cloud Sect, it was still a sect at the second level and had many powerful elders. What was more, its leader was a master of Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>His Hatred Evil Attack was strong when attacking a soul, and in the Central Region, most of the cultivators were weak in soul attack and defense.</p>

  <p>That was why he could slaughter all the people of a second level sect based on his elementary power of Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>"I will have you experience the pain of your soul crumbling, little by little.</p>

  <p>Even if I can't kill you in the magic array, the pain will torment you and make you remember forever! No... You won't remember it for a long time.</p>

  <p>After the pre-qualifying match, you will go to hell..."</p>

  <p>The cultivator with the white face was confident as he had killed many people with his Hatred Evil Attack. He even remembered the miserable expression on the face of each person he had killed. He knew the terrible might of his Hatred Evil Attack!</p>

  <p>In the palace, Michael, Xiao, and the mid-aged cultivator were staring at Luo Luo Zheng and the cultivator with the white face. They were worried that their conflict might become more serious.</p>

  <p>"The cultivation method of the cultivator called Stoney Zhao is sorcery. It looks so familiar! I seem to have seen it before somewhere." The mid-aged cultivator said, staring at the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>Michael smiled and explained, "Sure, it looks familiar. It is the Hatred Evil Attack. It was used by an old man called Evil Attacker thirty years ago!"</p>

  <p>Xiao nodded, "Yeah! I see. It is the Hatred Evil Attack. It is unexpected that the Evil Attacker has a successor in the Central Region."</p>

  <p>Thirty years ago, the Evil Attacker who was practicing the evil martial arts went insane, and he indiscriminately slaughtered a large number of innocent people. For that reason, the Evil Attacker was hunted by the Ethereal Spirit Sect, Cloud Hall, and the World Commercial Alliance. Finally, they managed to kill him.</p>

  <p>Since the Evil Attacker practiced the evil martial arts, he could separate his soul from his body. Even though his body was killed, his soul had escaped.</p>

  <p>Now, he seemed to be alive.</p>

  <p>However, once the soul left the body, just like a small lamp without oil, it couldn't survive in the world for a long time. This was why the sects and World Commercial Alliance had thought that the Evil Attacker had died.</p>

  <p>But it was beyond their expectation that thirty years later a warrior called Stoney Zhao would get the evil martial arts.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, practicing evil martial arts was not prohibited as long as it didn't lead to indiscriminate slaughter. Powerful sects wouldn't interfere with evil martial arts practitioners either, as they also followed many evil martial arts.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Luo Luo Zheng will be in great trouble! I have noticed that he hasn't taken his powerful sword spirit with him. Even though he is gifted with strong power, and has mastered the consummate sword intent, Luo Luo Zheng seems to have no chance against the Hatred Evil Attack," the mid-aged cultivator judged confidently.</p>

  <p>However, Michael smiled and asked, "How do you know Luo Luo Zheng is weak in soul attacking?"</p>

  <p>The soul often hid in the deepest part of the brain, and it was difficult to be found by others unless Luo Luo Zheng was willing to show it in public.</p>

  <p>The mid-aged cultivator shook his head, "Michael, as a swordsman, Luo Luo Zheng can be counted as a saint-level talent for his perfect swordsmanship, but he must have been practicing it since he was born! I really can't imagine how he can strengthen both his swordsmanship and his soul at the same time...</p>

  <p>Does this kind of talent exist in the world?"</p>

  <p>"Aha!" Michael smiled again, "Have you forgotten? Luo Luo Zheng is a rune master with Perfect Brushwork, and his achievement in rune is comparable to that of Arnold."</p>

  <p>Hearing Michael's words, the mid-aged cultivator was astonished and left speechless. It was widely known that the soul of a rune master wasn't weak by nature, and as long as it was cultivated continually, it would grow stronger and stronger!</p>

  <p>After seeing Luo Zheng's powerful and special sword spirit, he had forgotten that Luo Luo Zheng was a runic expert too!</p>

  <p>"Even though Luo Luo Zheng is a rune master, I'm afraid that he can't resist Stoney's Hatred Evil Attack, which seems to be terrible," Xiao added then.</p>

  <p>Michael nodded and said, "Yes. Luo Luo Zheng can only draw one and two-star runes, and his soul hasn't grown strong enough to fight against the Hatred Evil Attack. I don't know if Luo Luo Zheng has someone to help him..."</p>

  <p>In the magic array, Stoney's face was covered by the black light, and a black ghost hand stretched out from the top of his head.</p>

  <p>Stoney's soul had formed the black ghost hand. It wasn't the most terrible move in the Hatred Evil Attack, but it was the cruelest one as it meant that he could reach into other person's head and crumble his soul.</p>

  <p>"I will crush your soul! Skull Ghost Hand!"</p>

  <p>The black ghost hand made a whining noise, like a ghost's crying, as it stretched toward Luo Zheng's head. Instantly, the ghost hand reached above Luo Zheng's head with five long and thin fingers. It appeared as though the hand was going to penetrate Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Stoney's face darkened further when he saw that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't going to resist.</p>

  <p>"Cry!" he said. "Express your great pain through your tears and shrieks!"</p>
