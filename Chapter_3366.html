<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was understandable for Fuxi to act with hostility towards the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>After all, it was against the rules for Shera to enter the Icy Snow Province without consent.</p>

  <p>"This is the final warning. If you don't turn your ship back now, don't blame me for what happens next." Fuxi threatened her with his utmost resolve.</p>

  <p>The Icy Snow Province was open to the public, but it was still under the direct control of the Pear Hill. As long as the Pear Hill remained fair with the resource distribution in the Chaotic Source World, the other super forces were content with it.</p>

  <p>Instead of feeling intimidated by Fuxi's threat, Shera gave him a sweet smile and spoke calmly, "Don't fret yourself, Human Sovereign. I'm only here to send a young disciple to the Chaotic Source World. He has a ticket."</p>

  <p>Then she shifted her gaze upwards to the ship and said, "You can get off now."</p>

  <p>Those who were cultivated by the Black Ship were expected to grow more powerful in the future.</p>

  <p>Shera invited everyone's attention through her mention of the disciple. They all awaited his arrival with impatient eyes as they kept them fixated on the ship.</p>

  <p>"This woman seems to be really strong. What kind of force is the Black Ship?" Zheng whispered in a low tone as he asked Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"The people of the Black Ship are a group of bandits that run amuck everywhere in the Source World. It is said that there are only about a dozen of them, but each of them is a supreme master. We consider them to be one of the super forces," Dorothy explained to him.</p>

  <p>"There are only a dozen of them. And yet, they are considered to be a super force? Why is that so?" Zheng's pupils dilated in astonishment.</p>

  <p>According to his understanding, a super force had to have a long history and boast countless talents. For instance, the Oneness Sky Palace housed all human talents in the Source World other than the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's words had shocked Zheng as they contradicted his knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Why not? By now, you should know that strength decides everything. It is said that the leader of the Separate Abyss race has to show respect to the head of the Black Ship. The super forces inferior in power can't touch the Black Ship," Elvinia further explained to dissolve his confusion.</p>

  <p>Initially, Dorothy wanted to make it clear to Zheng, but Elvinia had beat her to it. A trace of anger flashed on Dorothy's face as she bit her lip.</p>

  <p>Elvinia noticed Dorothy's expression and gave her a mischievous smirk.</p>

  <p>Under Shera's command, a young man dressed in black jumped down from the ship. When he landed on the ground, his sheer force had created a ditch on the flat surface and sent ripples far and wide. Slowly, he stood up from his self-made hole and scanned his surroundings. The demeanor he displayed was arrogant and cold. Upon seeing the large number of eyes on him, he laughed and sneered, "Are all these creatures my prey in the Chaotic Source World? They seem so weak."</p>

  <p>Everyone present on the scene frowned at his words.</p>

  <p>The ones who came to the Icy Snow Province today were all from the super forces scattered across the Source World. Only the strongest young warriors from these forces were gathered today in one place. They were each qualified in terms of skills.</p>

  <p>And every talent was proud in their own unique way.</p>

  <p>However, they had to maintain a low profile as they were faced with many other strong warriors from across the Source World.</p>

  <p>They knew that there would eventually be someone who would be better than them. Although they were powerful, they preferred not to show off. It was better to stay on the safe side than provoke someone who surpassed them in strength. It wasn't wise to make too many enemies, or else they'd be besieged and killed in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>However, the young man who appeared from the ship seemed to not care about that. He looked at them as though they were inferior to him. As soon as he appeared, he uttered harsh words from the start. They had never come across a more arrogant man.</p>

  <p>Notable warriors like Athemar and Elizabeth didn't take the man seriously.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't seem to shift their eyes away from him either.</p>

  <p>But his words had provoked some hot-headed young members and disciples of many super forces.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are?"</p>

  <p>"How could you insult us like this by calling us your prey? Your arrogance will be the death of you!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better take that back. Otherwise you'll regret it when you enter the Chaotic Source World!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race, the Divine Farmer race, and some other large races collectively mocked the man. For a moment, the place became noisy with angry disciples ganging up to retaliate against the man.</p>

  <p>If it were an ordinary person, they would have yielded after hearing those angry words.</p>

  <p>However, that man stood tall on his feet, refusing to stand down. The corners of his mouth turned into a sinister smile as he returned their glares.</p>

  <p>A bright light flashed in his eyes as an irrefutable aura of soul gushed out from him.</p>

  <p>His soul aura was undeniably stronger than those of the Indigo Souls at the same level.</p>

  <p>"Such an incredible aura!"</p>

  <p>Sensing the overwhelming aura, the young disciples and the leaders such as Elizabeth and Athemar stood stunned. They couldn't believe that the man had cultivated his Soul of Light to such an extent in the Lust World. The members of the Black Ship were really a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>The small spectacle of his power tied the tongues of the young disciples.</p>

  <p>"How come the soul of this young man in black is so powerful?" A burly young man belonging to the Divine Farmer race voiced his concern from the crowd.</p>

  <p>A woman was standing next to him. Her curly hairs hung loosely on her face as though they were an accessory. She spoke in a teasing tone, "Uncle Mount, are you afraid of him because he's much stronger than you?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't count on a strong soul. When I surpass the Lust World and cultivate in the Desire World, my Soul of Light will advance to a higher level. I'll surpass him in no time. He shouldn't act so conceitedly since he's alone. This guy won't stand a chance if the others decide to lay siege against him in the Chaotic Source World," the burly young man blurted out as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." The woman beside him broke out in a fit of weird laughter, but she didn't refute his claims.</p>

  <p>A white-haired young man from the Bearing race nudged at his clansman with a frown on his face. "Khalid, keep a close watch on this guy once we enter the Chaotic Source World."</p>

  <p>Khalid, the man he addressed to, nodded and said, "Understood. He must possess a valuable Other Shore Token for him to cultivate his Soul of Light to such a degree."</p>

  <p>The true level-headed talents from various races did not shout curses to assert dominance. Instead, they quietly observed their opponents from a distance to concoct strategies against them, such as Zheng, Efrain, and Elvinia from the Oneness Sky Palace and Yan from Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Of course, the young man in black, namely the Evil God, had easily caught their attention.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God gave them a taste of his intimidating aura, he gave a smug smile and said, "Back on the Other Shore, all of you were running scared out of fear of being devoured by me. So, you took refuge inside the temples. I'd watch out if I were you since there are no temples for you to hide in the Chaotic Source World!"</p>

  <p>"What? Devoured by you?"</p>

  <p>Everyone in the crowd shared expressions of puzzlement on their faces before they realized who this man was.</p>

  <p>"Ah! No wonder his soul aura seems familiar!"</p>

  <p>"It's him! There's no mistake! He is the Soul Devouring Demon! It must be him!"</p>

  <p>"His voice sounds the same. I remember now!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the expressions of all the young men of the large races switched drastically.</p>

  <p>It was said another man had made trouble in Stage Four after Zheng destroyed the temple of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>No one could tell what soul theurgy this man used. They only knew he was capable of sucking all the Souls of Light into his body.</p>

  <p>It was apparent the cultivation of his Soul of Light improved significantly due to that. And yet he still retained his control over himself and didn't go mad at all.</p>

  <p>The three orthodox forces of the human race, as well as several other large races, had suffered irreversible damage by this man.</p>

  <p>The more Souls of Light he absorbed, the more his cultivation base improved. He was able to run amuck in the entire Stage Four and walked out unscathed.</p>

  <p>Since they were unaware of his origins, they had given him the title of the Soul Devouring Demon.</p>

  <p>The name of the Soul Devouring Demon soon caught the attention of many people. Each time they heard of it, the people would tremble in fear.</p>

  <p>However, never did they expect this man in black was the Soul Devouring Demon.</p>
