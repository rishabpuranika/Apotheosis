<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'What a pity, ' Zheng thought. He then said to Felix through his life vitality,</p>

  <p>"Felix, you're too slow."</p>

  <p>Felix was also vexed. He had been hiding in the Cloud Hall, waiting for Zheng's orders to activate the Mad Trap to carefully surround Eddie, and then activate the Thunder Wrath.</p>

  <p>The Mad Trap was said to be half magic array and half killing array. Once Eddie was caught in it, he would fall into endless illusions. And then, the lightning from the Thunder Wrath would be able to hit him directly.</p>

  <p>But Eddie was sensitive enough to be the first to sense the killing intent, rushing out of the Mad Trap and dodging the Thunder Wrath's lightning.</p>

  <p>A runic expert at the Internal Elixir Realm and a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm had conspired to kill the strongest man in the Central Region. If word of this got out, it would cause chaos.</p>

  <p>Even worse, they had almost done it.</p>

  <p>It could be that the Mad Trap could not kill Eddie and the Thunder Wrath could only heavily injure him. But the warriors of the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the Cloud Hall couldn't be underestimated. They were weak in the eyes of the warriors at the Life and Death Realm, but if they attacked Eddie together, they could cause him some serious injuries and ensure that he could not fight back.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Cloud Hall also had a powerful head Yudie, and Imogen, who belonged to the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>The elders, who had been scared witless by Eddie a while ago, looked pityingly at him.</p>

  <p>Even Imogen, who had her poker face on, was filled with regret.</p>

  <p>Yudie was sitting on the Mysterious Ice halberd, her white, slender legs slightly swinging. She pouted but didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>Eddie had so far absorbed the good luck of a countless number of people.</p>

  <p>Killing him would not be so easy.</p>

  <p>Eddie's heart was still beating intensely after he had distanced himself from the Cloud Hall, proving his strength and power. It was not until he had avoided the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array that he began to feel a lingering sense of fear.</p>

  <p>If he was truly trapped, and the Cloud Hall's members pounced on him, he would probably die. This was something that Eddie had never expected.</p>

  <p>He had been a mass murderer and grew up tenaciously in all sorts of dangerous situations. He had encountered countless dangers, but ever since he had crossed the line between life and death, nobody had ever made him feel so close to death.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning of the battle, that hateful boy Zheng had been standing at the edge of the enchanted barrier, looking at him with an indifferent gaze.</p>

  <p>This boy was really tricky.</p>

  <p>He had just reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, but he had countless tricks up his sleeve. If this guy stepped into the Internal Elixir Realm or the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he would become a huge threat to Eddie one day.</p>

  <p>Eddie had initially wanted to kill Zheng just to get revenge for Eden and Marilyn. But now that he realized that Zheng was an obstacle on his path, he knew he had to clear him out on the way to his great dream.</p>

  <p>As Zheng watched Eddie, Eddie closed the distance between them and said,</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you are qualified to be my opponent."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the elders of the Virtual Tribulation Realm felt like the blood had drained from their heads, waves of dizziness coming over them.</p>

  <p>A strong warrior who had lived for hundreds of years and crossed the line between life and death was actually saying such words to a teenage boy.</p>

  <p>That Zheng was qualified to be his opponent! Zheng wasn't even qualified to fight against any of the elders of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, leave alone Eddie. The elders were strong enough that they could easily kill Zheng in an instant.</p>

  <p>But Eddie's words startled and shocked the elders. What a strange world they lived in!</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression did not change. He suppressed his emotions and coldly said, "Let go of Yan, and I will spare your life."</p>

  <p>"What? Oh good God!"</p>

  <p>An elder said with a cough, swallowing his saliva with difficulty and nearly choking to death on it.</p>

  <p>The other elders were watching on, their eyes wide with disbelief.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng had given the Cloud Hall too many surprises, but he was too arrogant to say that. Was he scared by Eddie's earlier attack? Why had he started talking nonsense?</p>

  <p>Even Imogen was stunned. She had never even dreamed that Zheng would dare to say that.</p>

  <p>But Yudie had reacted differently. "Ha-ha!" she laughed and tried to cover her mouth with both her hands. Zheng was too interesting and stoic, as if he didn't know what pressure was. Yan was Zheng's most important sibling, and she meant everything to him in this world. Zheng was not interested in being Eddie's opponent. To Zheng, learning martial arts was a thorny path with no end. He could only climb this peak bit by bit, and Eddie was the biggest obstacle he had to cross.</p>

  <p>Eddie was also stunned when he heard Zheng's answer.</p>

  <p>He, a mighty warrior of the Central Region, was indeed impressed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng had unprecedented achievements in the area of runes. That was why he dared utter such words.</p>

  <p>Eddie's face had blackened with anger as he was humiliated, but he soon laughed and said, "Ha-ha! Spare me? You're indeed ambitious! But don't worry about your sister for now. Just think about how long you can live for!</p>

  <p>I don't believe that you will stay in the Cloud Hall forever!"</p>

  <p>Eddie was unable to break through the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array, but what if he found another Purple Power Body? If he managed to arrange the Lustful Demon Array, his strength would increase by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>And then, the Cloud Hall might not be able to stop him.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced coldly at Eddie. He then left the barrier and flew down as he told Felix through his life vitality, "Drive him away."</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Under Felix's control, the Thunder Wrath shot a bolt of lightning, striking Eddie.</p>

  <p>The operation of the sect-protecting array also required the support of life vitality crystals, and every lightning would require several supreme life vitality crystals. But Felix, unmindful of the expense, controlled the array and guided the lightning onto Eddie's body. Eddie was unable to break the barrier, so he could only passively feel the impact. He wanted to say something, but Zheng had left.</p>

  <p>Eddie did not leave Cloudy City immediately. Since he had been angered by a warrior of the Illuminating Soul Realm, he needed to vent his anger. So it was Cloudy City that suffered.</p>

  <p>Standing high above the Cloud Hall, they saw a cloud of dust suddenly rise up at the edge of Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>Cloudy City was large. Around the city were square brick walls that extended for over a hundred miles. Eddie drilled into the walls. He went about destroying them as he circled the city, causing at least a few hundred casualties.</p>

  <p>To Eddie, the people in the city were all ants. Although he could vent his anger by destroying the entire city, he was not interested in killing ants.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he had never been to the Killing Sword Mountain. The consequences of killing too many people would be troublesome because he would get infected with heavy malicious aura, and he would then have to spend time getting rid of it.</p>

  <p>Only after he had destroyed the walls did he leave, satisfied.</p>

  <p>After Eddie left, lines of wrinkles appeared slowly on Imogen's young face.</p>

  <p>Soon after, her hair gradually turned white and her waist bent over. She looked old and clumsy again.</p>

  <p>Yudie floated over to her, grabbing her arm and said with a giggle, "Master, how beautiful you were just a moment ago."</p>

  <p>"Don't make fun of me!" Imogen said, rolling her eyes. She had mastered the Law of Life, so her life vitality had been able to return her to youth. She could also use more life vitality to stay young, but there was no need for that.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall's atmosphere gradually relaxed. Having dealt with Eddie, the heavy burden in their hearts had finally dissipated.</p>

  <p>When the elders had appeared, the disciples of the Cloud Hall had also been secretly watching. Seeing Zheng standing under the barrier and not dodging Eddie's attacks, they all sighed admiringly.</p>

  <p>"What's so special about this? The barrier is strong. Zheng just hid behind it!</p>

  <p>It was not dangerous at all!" An unimpressed disciple of the Cloud Hall said.</p>

  <p>"First of all, the barrier is equipped with the runes that Zheng has drawn. And second of all, even if Eddie were to try again, I bet you wouldn't dare to go there and face him!" another disciple of the Cloud Hall retorted.</p>

  <p>The first disciple immediately fell silent. Even though they knew there was no danger, not everyone was courageous enough to face Eddie. Similarly, some people were afraid of heights. They didn't dare to go up or down a flight of stairs even though they knew it wasn't dangerous.</p>
