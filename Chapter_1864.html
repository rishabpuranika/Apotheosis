<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1864 The Third Category (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The prophet wasn't exactly sure how Zheng had entered the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Under regular circumstances, once a martial artist had appeared in a teleporting area, he would begin completing various missions, striving and working hard to earn various trial tallies.</p>

  <p>These trial tallies were divided into five kinds and were ultimately characterized with different colors: black, purple, red, green, and white, In the eyes of any outsider, and to any warrior who had any knowledge on the subject, the purple trial tallies were considered top-level.</p>

  <p>In the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the black trial tally was nothing more than a grand legend. They had only heard of it a few times, but no one had ever seen one before!</p>

  <p>With time, everyone simply believed that there was no black trial tally in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and it was a myth that they had carried for years on end. As a result, the purple trial tally became the top-ranked.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know though, was that the black trial tally actually did exist! Only that, obtaining such was extremely rare and very few ever held one in hand.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was only the martial artists of the third category earlier spoken about by the prophet that even had the right to obtain a black trial tally.</p>

  <p>In other words, only seven martial artists had actually obtained a black trial tally before Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was all thanks to Liusu that Zheng had entered the sacred place for body refinement. He held the black tally in his hand, flipping it over in his palm. He didn't have a complete grasp of the colors classification when it came to the trial tallies.</p>

  <p>The prophet had stayed here for so many years and had imagined countless times how he would hand this black trial tally over. In the imagined scenarios, he expected Zheng to be extremely shocked and excited upon seeing the black trial tally appear before him.</p>

  <p>The prophet felt somewhat disappointed. In contrast to what he had expected, Zheng's face was expressionless. He casually took the black trial tally from the prophet's hand.</p>

  <p>"This is the black trial tally!," the prophet emphasized. His tone was flat, but he still wanted to remind Zheng of this trial tally's true value.</p>

  <p>"Is this better than a purple trial tally?" Zheng asked. He had seen Kennan take out purple trial tallies before and hand them over to the Collapsing Mountain race. To Liusu, a purple trial tally was pretty common. If this black trial tally really was better than a purple one, then it would certainly be of a higher rank as well.</p>

  <p>"Of... of course..." The Collapsing Mountain race prophet stuttered. He didn't know how to reply. Clearly, Zheng had no understanding of the trial tallies classification if he was asking such a question. How did this brat even get his hands on a purple trial tally and enter the Collapsing Mountain race in the first place, thought the bewildered prophet.</p>

  <p>At least, this guy would eventually discover the astonishing benefits of the black trial tally! His thoughts pressed on resentfully. The prophet made an attempt and got over his disappointment.</p>

  <p>"As for what Chapman and others are seeking, if you can help them, such will be considered a form of training for you. However, we creatures of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land will ultimately never be able to leave this place. My master hasn't given us a way to surpass the heavens." The prophet shook his head with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings had set up the heavens in such a way that allowed the martial artists in the universe to cross over and enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the master of this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had never even constructed heavens. There was no Supreme Lords here, and the creatures living on the land would never be capable of leaving.</p>

  <p>What Chapman and the others pursued was something the other five sacred places equally aimed for. It was just that the prophets of these six sacred places were all well aware that what they were seeking was nothing more than an illusion!</p>

  <p>From this point of view, the many races in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land couldn't come close to comparing to even the secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng finally understood Chapman's thoughts, as well as that of all the others living in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Martial artists fought for mastery. If there was no opponent, then there was no reason to fight. If such was the case, then martial artists couldn't get very far in the pursuit of martial arts.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Chapman and the others were thanks to the abundance of the strength source they absorbed, they were restricted to only one small corner. They couldn't compete with the martial artists of the divine land. And they would quickly lose the necessary motivation to achieve higher!</p>

  <p>Zheng had actually guessed at the idea that whatever Chapman had asked him to take from the flame, didn't even exist. It was merely an impossible mission set by the Holy Being. It had a mysterious attraction to the races that guarded the six great sacred places, giving them something to strive for, a reason to push forward - but like a banana hanging off a rod in front of a donkey, they would never be able to actually reach it.</p>

  <p>Of course, this had nothing to do with Zheng personally.</p>

  <p>Zheng had promised Chapman that he would help him retrieve the item in the flame.</p>

  <p>And with the black trial tally in hand, Zheng left the prophet's tent.</p>

  <p>The test was already over, and Chapman had already set a date with Zheng to set off. He never dared ask Zheng what the prophet had said…</p>

  <p>Even if he had asked, Zheng wouldn't have told him a thing. In any case, the prophet had warned him not to speak of their conversation to the Collapsing Mountain race, especially to Chapman.</p>

  <p>That night, a strange feeling struck Zheng, one that stemmed all the way from his inner world. His eyes popped wide open, slightly startled by what he had seen in the inner world.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that in such a short period of time, the inner world within his body would evolve so quickly that a war would erupt!</p>
