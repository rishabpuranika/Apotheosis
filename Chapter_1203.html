<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1203 The Dragon-shaped Monster </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Fiona was puzzled.</p>

  <p>She believed her father when he said that the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place might be an empty city, and there might not be anything else.</p>

  <p>But she wondered why her blood had pounded through her as she entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, as if an invisible force had begun to put pressure on her.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Fiona?" War King Wind asked, concerned. He had tried comforting his daughter but Fiona didn't seem to be convinced or relieved. Instead, she looked even more nervous.</p>

  <p>Fiona's brown eyes were worried as she said, "I just heard a sound..."</p>

  <p>"Fiona, don't be too nervous!" Callan also tried to console her.</p>

  <p>Fiona pursed her lips. She was afraid, but it probably wouldn't be dangerous if her father and the Soul Sea Realm masters stayed with her.</p>

  <p>So she nodded and continued to follow them. But her nervousness didn't go away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked up to Fiona and looked at her, frowning slightly at her nervous expression. There were people in this world who had special senses. Perhaps she really could sense something strange, seeing as she was a phoenix descendant.</p>

  <p>Fiona had hardly walked eighty feet when her body suddenly stiffened.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The sound of bones being gnawed rang out again.</p>

  <p>Fiona suddenly turned her head while controlling the corpse to keep walking. She looked to the street nearby and came to a stop, as if she had suddenly become glued to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Fiona!" War King Wind frowned at his daughter's behavior. Fiona had always been a clever, obedient girl. Sure, she was naive, but as a warrior, she was definitely not timid. If she were a coward, she wouldn't have wanted to challenge Luo Zheng who had defeated Logan before!</p>

  <p>Many Soul Sea Realm masters looked at Fiona suspiciously. No one knew what she was up to.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A clear voice rang out.</p>

  <p>In this spacious, sacred place, it sounded like a wild beast gnawing on bones.</p>

  <p>Such a sound belonged to a forest. But they were in the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place right now and there weren't any living creatures in the Feather Holy Sea. Everyone agreed on this. There were a few warriors who argued that there might be some living creatures hiding in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, but most other warriors didn't think so.</p>

  <p>After all, the Feather Holy Sea was protected by the power of the blood sacrifice. So how could any living creature survive in such a place?</p>

  <p>"There..." Fiona's eyes flashed strangely and she said, "I can feel it! I can feel its presence!"</p>

  <p>No one questioned Fiona now that everyone had heard the voice.</p>

  <p>Someone asked, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Fiona began trembling. Her red lips suddenly paled. "It is my nemesis! The nemesis of my life!" she said, her voice shaky.</p>

  <p>This shocked the Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>The nemesis?</p>

  <p>What nemesis did humans have?</p>

  <p>Humans had many enemies in the Upper World, but no race had been able to stop the expansion of the human race. Although there were millions of races in the one hundred thousand supreme worlds in the Upper World, each of them had their own unique characteristics. There were some strong races among them, like the Demon Night and the ogre.</p>

  <p>But the human race had expanded the fastest. So far, they had occupied nearly ten thousand supreme worlds and they were practically invincible.</p>

  <p>Then what was the nemesis that Fiona was talking about?</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed as Brianna's perception came from the inner world.</p>

  <p>"This woman has the bloodline of the Genuine Phoenix, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng said. It was not a big deal for Brianna to figure out that Fiona was a descendant of the Genuine Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Brianna said, "Dragons have competed with phoenixes since time immemorial. As two supreme legendary beasts in the universe, the Genuine Dragon and the Genuine Phoenix have fought for countless eras. If she feels a nemesis close by, she might be sensing the existence of a Genuine Dragon."</p>

  <p>"Genuine Dragon?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. Even though the souls of nine Genuine Dragons existed in his mind, he had never seen a Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>But why would a Genuine Dragon appear in such a small world? If it was an adult Genuine Dragon, its body would be tens of thousands of miles long. How could there be a Genuine Dragon in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land?</p>

  <p>Brianna answered his unasked question, "Perhaps the Ancestral Dragon egg has hatched, but this Ancestral Dragon... But that shouldn't be the case." Suspicion crept up her voice. She was just speculating, and her speculations seemed to contradict each other.</p>

  <p>As everyone looked around in confusion, War King Wind asked, "Fiona, your nemesis? What nemesis do you have?"</p>

  <p>Fiona shook her head. Her body continued to tremble as if she were in a world of ice and snow. "I... I don't know. I only have a vague feeling that is very terrifying!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked up to Fiona, stared at her, his golden eyes boring into hers, and asked, "Is it a dragon?"</p>

  <p>Fiona's eyes flashed with fear at Zheng's words. Before this, she had only had a vague sense of this kind of fear. Now Zheng's words, like a candle lit in the darkness, caused her perception to become clear. "Yes, it's a dragon. A most extraordinary one!"</p>

  <p>"Ancestral Dragon!"</p>

  <p>"Could it be that the Ancestral Dragon egg has already hatched?"</p>

  <p>"We might be in trouble. I've heard that the Ancestral Dragon egg is impossible to hatch. But it's weird if it has hatched. Why would it hatch now? We'd better go back right now. If the Ancestral Dragon appears in this world, I'm afraid the whole great world will collapse!"</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters began to speculate at Fiona's words.</p>

  <p>Their goal was to obtain the Ancestral Dragon egg. But they had just wanted to take the egg away, not a living dragon. This Ancestral Dragon most likely concerned the entirety of the Genuine Dragon race. They knew that it might be quite strong even if it had just hatched. So how could they resist it after all?</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were about to retreat when a voice suddenly sounded again.</p>

  <p>A clattering sound could be heard.</p>

  <p>The sound was extremely clear, coming from the street running parallel to the crowd. Soon, everyone saw a black mass appear at the corner of the street. As they looked over, they saw a tiny black dragon-shaped monster chewing on a snow-white bone.</p>

  <p>It wasn't big and had a dragon head on a short body, looking like a small dragon. But it had a pair of long, snow-white fangs on either side of its mouth.</p>

  <p>"Is it a dragon?"</p>

  <p>"This isn't a dragon, right? How can a dragon look like this?"</p>

  <p>"Even if it's a dragon, there's nothing to be afraid of..."</p>

  <p>The voice had shocked everyone, but the appearance of the small, dragon-shaped monster filled them with relief.</p>

  <p>Everyone had occupied a corpse, but their perceptions still came from their souls. Just with one glance, they could tell that this little thing wasn't strong or powerful.</p>

  <p>"Fiona, are you afraid of this little thing? I can go and capture it for you!" a Soul Sea Realm master of the Wind Divine Kingdom said, controlling his corpse as he rushed towards the little monster.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted for the master to stop. "Don't go there!"</p>

  <p>But the Soul Sea Realm master was too fast. In an instant, he was close enough that stretching his hand would help him catch the dragon-shaped monster.</p>

  <p>The dragon-shaped monster suddenly raised its head and opened its mouth— a mouth that was completely out of proportion to its body. It roared at the Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>Its voice was extremely loud, completely at odds with its small body.</p>

  <p>The sound wave it let out forced everyone to cover their ears. They watched in horror as the upper half of the corpse that the Soul Sea Realm master had occupied disintegrated into powder.</p>

  <p>What was more, even half the house that was behind the Soul Sea Realm master also collapsed the same way as the master.</p>
