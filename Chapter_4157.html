<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4157 The Source Of Curse </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sheehan's plan was simple.</p>

  <p>His objective was to kill Cornelius, so from the very beginning, he focused on him alone, locking him as his target.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Half of the sky was overlaid with the dispersed purple light.</p>

  <p>In the purple zone, Sheehan was nearly indestructible. This was his game.</p>

  <p>No one would be able to calculate his movements, what more to counter them.</p>

  <p>Just now, Sheehan did not fly over the long distance when he took the Snake Spirit King to the edge, nor did he open a space channel. He just disappeared from a place and reappeared at another place. To Sheehan, it was quite simple, but to the others, it was incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>With Sheehan's unpredictable movements, there was no way for anyone to be able to locate where he was or to determine when to strike. Within the purple light, he was moving too fast.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Sheehan disappeared once again.</p>

  <p>Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, felt his body tremble, and then, before he was able to react, he was lifted into the air and then thrown into the Void Dust again. It all happened too fast.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p>

  <p>Just like that, Cornelius was completely devoured by the Void Dust, leaving nothing behind, Then the ball that wrapped around his coordinates appeared again.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Sheehan, the ball appeared outside of the purple light.</p>

  <p>He knew he had to get the ball, but if he were to step outside of the light, he would put himself in danger.</p>

  <p>As he extended his wings, the purple light extended as well, reaching for the ball.</p>

  <p>He treated the light as if it were a part of his body. If he were able to move it far enough to meet the ball, he would be able to claim it without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>However, as the light inched closer to the ball, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>The ball avoided the light. If the light flew towards the ball, the ball would fly even further from it. The two moved at the same speed, making it nearly impossible for the two to meet.</p>

  <p>After the nearly hundred-mile-chase, the Snake Spirit King emerged from the ball.</p>

  <p>As soon as this happened, Sheehan immediately began his attack, once again enveloping the Snake Spirit King with the light and throwing him into the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>However, this time, it was different. Even though the Snake Spirit King was still struggling, his beady, crescent-shaped eyes were telling a different story— one of vengeance. Little did Sheehan know that a three-headed snake was crawling at his back.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was not stupid. From the very beginning, he knew that with Sheehan's abilities, especially in terms of speed, he would not be able to compete.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King had all the resources he needed, but he knew he didn't need to exhaust all that to defeat Sheehan. A Holy Item could do it for him.</p>

  <p>The three-headed snake, which was named the Source of Curse, was the second Holy Item in the Snake Spirit King's collection.</p>

  <p>It had long been in his collection and had been used by him for a long time. The Source of Curse was able to put three curse marks on three targets. As long as the opponent killed one of the targets, from the back of the opponent would emerge a three-headed snake.</p>

  <p>The twist was only the Snake Spirit King could see the three-headed snake; it was invisible to anyone else, even to the one who carried it.</p>

  <p>Whenever the carrier would kill one of the targets, one of the snake's head would open its eyes. This went on until the carrier killed three targets to open all of the heads' eyes. Once all of the eyes were open, the three-headed snake would be in full effect, controlling its carrier.</p>

  <p>In the past, when the Snake Spirit King used the Source of Curse, he would have to sacrifice three snake spirits.</p>

  <p>In this situation, as the Snake Spirit King revived himself in the form of the Treacherous Being, he would be able to sacrifice himself three times to fully activate his curse.</p>

  <p>Hiss, hiss, hiss...</p>

  <p>The three-headed snake snapped all of its eyes open.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Sheehan began to feel something strange appearing behind him. His resting wings sprung up, trembling with unusual vigor.</p>

  <p>Against his will, he kept flying in the purple light. Eventually, his body began to leap crazily in all sorts of directions.</p>

  <p>As the flying speed of Sheehan increased, the Snake Spirit King saw countless figures flashing within the purple light. He stared at them, realizing they were neither illusions nor shadows. These figures were all Sheehan, who, in the high speed of flight, appeared to the ordinary eye as multiple bodies. The Snake Spirit King laughed manically.</p>

  <p>"It's useless, Sheehan. Whatever you do, you won't be able to get rid of the Source of Curse," he said, sadistically amused with what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>The way the Source of Curse operated was reminiscent of a blooming flower. The more Sheehan struggled, the more it thrived, spreading its power further and even greater within its host. As it physically exhausted Sheehan and sucked all of his power out, it grew stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>Eventually, it had completely entangled Sheehan.</p>

  <p>The purple light shrank, and Sheehan fell from the air, grasping for his breath.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King looked at him mockingly and smiled down on him condescendingly. "You are so pitiful..." "Throw him into the Void Dust," he commanded, with no ounce of mercy.</p>

  <p>Usually, even without the Spiritual Boat, Sheehan would be able to sail through the Void Dust with the help of his large and powerful wings.</p>

  <p>However, with the Source of Curse sucking all of his power dry, he wouldn't be able to help himself, leaving him to be devoured by the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p>

  <p>Soon, Sheehan's Treacherous Being body was dragged by the Snake Spirit King's three-headed snake and thrown into the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>After that, the battle between the Bird Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King finally ended.</p>

  <p>"The Limited Omnipotent Stone," the Snake Spirit King muttered.</p>

  <p>The diamond-shaped gem etched onto his forehead began to glow, and he began to see everything in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>To protect Sheehan, the Bird Spirit Sect hid his coordinates.</p>

  <p>However, in the Three Purities Stage, there were only a few things that could avoid the Limited Omnipotent Stone. One of them was the bubble of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>Having activated the Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Snake Spirit King was made aware of where Sheehan's coordinates was hidden. He immediately went to the ground, running towards the battlefield in the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>In the middle rear of the battlefield were the three Bird Masters of the Bird Spirit Sect, Lawler, Duran, and Orval, fighting fiercely against Sewell.</p>

  <p>At first, the three Bird Masters followed behind the Bird Spirit King, trying to protect him from danger, but the Bird Spirit King was simply too fast. They were unable to catch up with him. By the time they arrived at the Bird Spirit King's destination, they had found that he already disappeared with the Snake Spirit King, leaving only Sewell.</p>

  <p>Because they were so worried about Sheehan's safety, even though they did not want to, they fought Sewell, forcing him to tell them where the Bird Spirit King went.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Sewell did not know where the Bird Spirit King went with the Snake Spirit King. Even if he knew where they were, it would be impossible for him to say it. The battle was already decided for him.</p>

  <p>Even Lawler was able to hold Sewell to a draw alone. Moreover, he had the help of Duran and Orval now.</p>

  <p>Even though Sewell was trying to keep his composure, under the siege of the three Bird Masters, he could hardly hold on.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Lawler's body was held frozen as if he forgot to breathe.</p>

  <p>"Lawler, what's the matter with you?" Duran asked in confusion, worrying for his friend. He had been working with him for so long, but this was the first time he had seen him stunned into immovability.</p>

  <p>Lawler gently waved his right wing, revealing the golden coordinates.</p>

  <p>When Duran and Orval saw this, their expressions changed drastically, joining that of Lawler's.</p>

  <p>"Our king..."</p>

  <p>"He has been killed!"</p>

  <p>"Has he lost the battle with the Snake Spirit King?"</p>

  <p>The three Bird Masters were all in a state of confusion and panic, their distressed voices overlapping each other's questions.</p>

  <p>At this time, this was the last thing they wanted to happen.</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit King's strength was not less than the Snake Spirit King's; in this aspect, they probably equaled each other. To think of Sheehan dying was unacceptable to them, but the result was not that shocking to them as he had not awakened and the Snake Spirit King possessed the Holy Items.</p>

  <p>What shocked them more was the short period wherein this happened.</p>

  <p>While the three Bird Masters were stirring in their sad air, Sewell, on the other hand, was overcome with joy. He had been continuously defeated, but seeing this was more than enough to provide him with great courage.</p>

  <p>His body suddenly sprung up into the sky, flying towards the coordinates on Lawler's wing.</p>

  <p>If the coordinates were destroyed, the Bird Spirit King would completely perish. Because of this, Lawler, despite his extreme sadness, carried on, doing his best to protect it from Sewell.</p>

  <p>As Sewell went for his wing, Lawler withdrew it, soaring higher into the sky.</p>

  <p>However, as he was about to shoot higher up in the air, a huge shadow enveloped him.</p>
