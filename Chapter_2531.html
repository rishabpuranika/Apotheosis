<br/><br/>

  

  <p>After a few moments, Zelda finally decided to scan the blood-colored wild bone.</p>

  <p>She slowly approached it, stretched out a slender hand and gently stroked the wild bone's surface.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng didn't say anything about Zelda's actions. It seemed that she wanted to draw out the Wild God Power from the blood-colored wild bone.</p>

  <p>She continued to stroke the wild bone's surface, until her fingers pressed more firmly against it.</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>At that moment, a wisp of blood red Wild God Power began to circle constantly around her fingertip.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows shot up to his forehead in surprise. "That's a really insane Wild God Power!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Wild God Power in ordinary wild bones only contained a strange kind of energy, but no special emotions.</p>

  <p>However, in this one, there was a violent aura hidden in the Wild God Power that was ready to burst at any moment.</p>

  <p>There was a bare trace of gratitude on Zelda's face. She smiled, and let the wisp of Wild God Power sink between her hands.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power unfurled into the depths between her hands like a cloud of ink in water, transforming into a fascinating shape.</p>

  <p>After a while, it finally stabilized and turned into a shadow of the blood wolf. The fierce wolf's head opened its ferocious mouth and emitted a strong, wild aura.</p>

  <p>"What creature is that?" Zheng asked curiously. A gentle sigh escaped Zelda's lips.</p>

  <p>"As expected, it's the blood wild bone of the Spirit Wolf God," she explained.</p>

  <p>"The Spirit Wolf God?" asked Zheng. "Yes!"</p>

  <p>Zelda's eyes shone with delight as she looked at the small blood-colored wolf shadow in her palm. "I never expected that there could be such a huge piece of blood wild bone in this barren area. The Spirit Wolf God is ranked 61st on the List of Blood Lineage, which is a very powerful bloodline."</p>

  <p>She had dug out two pieces of egg-sized wild bones that contained Chiyou's bloodline way back before. Those wild bones were a hundred times more valuable than the ordinary ones because of Chiyou's blood inside them.</p>

  <p>"It is said that a great clan in the Northern Leaning Bone Tower has inherited the blood of the Spirit Wolf God for generations. They have longed for the wild bones that contain the Spirit Wolf God's blood so much. You cannot absorb this blood wild bone, but if you sell it, you can buy at least 50 wild bones of the same size," Zelda said in a shaky voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng could sense that she tried hard to calm herself down.</p>

  <p>Fifty wild bones of a man's size was a huge fortune.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that I can't absorb it?" Zheng asked in disbelief. She had told him that it was impossible for one to simply absorb a blood wild bone, unless their body also contained the same kind of blood.</p>

  <p>A smile stretched on Zelda's face at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"You can try if you don't believe me."</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng did not buy it as he preferred to absorb the wild bone himself than sell it.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, he stretched out his hand and carefully touched the surface of the blood wild bone. Then, he used the Trickle Spring Method that Zelda had taught him to extract the Wild God Power from it.</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the bone released a bloody streak of Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the violent torrent of Wild God Power, he stretched a hand out and gently drew it in— he didn't know that it was unruly and seemed to have its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>Yet, its consciousness was weak. It wouldn't resist him for too long.</p>

  <p>After he had increased his mind pressure, he finally forced the Wild God Power into his own body.</p>

  <p>Although the blood colored Wild God Power was indeed infused into his body, he soon found something strange.</p>

  <p>His body could absorb the ordinary Wild God Power with some effort, but this Wild God Power was different. It constantly rejected his body every time he tried and refused to be absorbed.</p>

  <p>After several failed attempts, he had to withdraw his mind pressure.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the untamable Wild God Power dissipated from his body.</p>

  <p>"It really is impossible to absorb it," he said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>Zelda just smiled faintly like she was used to it. "Of course it is. In this world, one's greatest advantage is their blood power. Those forces inside the bone towers all have immensely strong blood powers. They are born noble. We're no match for them," she said.</p>

  <p>She did think that Zheng was incredibly strong when he cultivated in the True God Realm, but he actually was still nothing compared to the real, powerful Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't mind her words at all and said, "In that case, this blood wild bone can be only used in exchange for the ordinary wild bones."</p>

  <p>Only if he had absorbed enough wild bones could he practice to become a Wild God, thereby improving his strength.</p>

  <p>He put away his blood wild bone and asked once more, "By the way, what is the List of Blood Lineage you mentioned just now?"</p>

  <p>Zelda was already used to his ignorance about worldly matters, so she duly explained, "The List of Blood Lineage is a list created by the powerful forces in the blood towers. It is arranged according to the power of the different kinds of blood."</p>

  <p>"Do you know the rank of Chiyou's blood in the list?" Zheng immediately asked the moment she finished.</p>

  <p>As his mother said, Chiyou was one of the top warriors in the Source World, and the Nine Li race was once a well-known great force.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the wild bones at the bottom of the chaos had descended from the Source World, which was why he naturally wanted to know the ranking of Chiyou's blood.</p>

  <p>"In third place," Zelda answered quickly.</p>

  <p>"In third place..."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Chiyou's blood has a strong blood power, and even if the Yellow Emperor's blood is ranked second, they're actually not far off from each other. Their bloodlines have been in a feud for who knows how long," she added.</p>

  <p>"The Yellow Emperor!" Zheng exclaimed excitedly. He knew that the Nine Li race was not in good terms with the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>The reason Chiyou had built the ship— the divine land— was so his people had a place to flee from the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>However, the fight between the two races unexpectedly extended to the bottom of the chaos, a desolate place full of bones.</p>

  <p>"Whose blood power is ranked first on the list?" he asked again. 'Who could possibly be greater than Chiyou and the Yellow Emperor?' he thought.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Goddess's blood," Zelda whispered.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Goddess's blood..."</p>

  <p>Zheng racked his brains for information and tried to remember.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know much about the Source World, he could get some information from where he was now.</p>

  <p>Then again, his mother had never mentioned anything about the existence of the Snake Goddess race to him.</p>

  <p>Was that race also one of the big races in the Source World?</p>

  <p>He did have a faint memory of associating it from the shadow of Snake Goddess that Yan had summoned. Furthermore, his mother had said that Yan's blood was different from his. Could it be that Yan had the blood of the Snake Goddess race?</p>

  <p>Still, it was only a guess.</p>

  <p>Now that he knew everything that he wanted to know, he didn't ask any more questions. He sat cross-legged, practiced the Trickle Spring Method Zelda had taught to extract the Wild God Power from some of the ordinary wild bones, and integrated them into his own body.</p>

  <p>Just like what had happened before, he did not miss anything when the Wild God Power was fully infused into his body.</p>

  <p>A small smile made its way to Zelda's lips. She sat down beside him as well, and began to refine the wild bones Zheng had given her.</p>
