</p>

  <p>However, at this moment Zheng's primary concern was revolving around what the current test was all about.</p>

  <p>"Saul, as you mentioned, this test was set by an immortal. But I'm only half-step into the nature level. How could I possibly undergo that test successfully?" Luo Zheng asked with a wide frown across his face.</p>

  <p>If in fact the legendary immortal did set all the problems which would appear in the test, let alone Luo Zheng, even the greatest masters of all times from the Eastern Region would probably fail it.</p>

  <p>Saul grinned upon hearing the response as he pointed to the things in the yard and said, "Look at everything in this courtyard carefully. Aren't they all over a hundred times bigger than you?"</p>

  <p>Upon giving everything a second glance, Luo Zheng gave an accepting nod. It was evident that the courtyard was designed by immortals. Every wall there was over thousands of feet high, which made Luo Zheng feel like a little ant crawling on the ground as he walked through the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it is strange that I showed up before you in this appearance?" Saul asked again, with a wide smile still persisting on his face.</p>

  <p>The entire scene was indeed rather strange. From the moment he entered the fairy palace, all the objects were of massive proportion, except the puppet Saul who was about Zheng's size.</p>

  <p>"The test is designed to find the most suitable successor, so the candidate's strength is primarily taken into consideration. But obviously if the immortal modeled the test based on his own ability and strengths, then chances are that no one would inherit the fairy palace," Saul continued in a bid to instill confidence. "The test formulated only for pushing your limits. It means that the stronger a candidate is, the more difficult the test will be. If you can surpass your limits and excel your own standards, then you can pass the test!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, now I understand. This is fair enough," Luo Zheng said, as he sighed in relief while his heart swelled up with adoration, 'The immortal really has far-reached supernatural power and intuition. The test is tailor-made for the contestants and the best of their abilities!'</p>

  <p>The Desperate Melee was well-designed as well. The design would eliminate all unqualified competitors in the beginning, leaving behind the one true participant for the test.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng moved on with Saul. Soon they were in an enormous building with a threshold at the height of a few dozen feet. Saul then crossed the threshold with a hop.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked right over to the threshold, then he slammed his feet against the ground, and he came to the threshold's other side.</p>

  <p>And on the other side, Luo Zheng saw a small talisman on the ground, and Saul was standing right beside it.</p>

  <p>"Come here. Stand on this talisman and begin your test," Saul said patiently.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found the palace like a minefield. Keeping in mind what Saul said earlier, he knew that the test would be very dangerous.</p>

  <p>If and when Luo Zheng passed the test, he would be the fairy palace's owner.</p>

  <p>Inheriting such a majestic and esteemed fairy palace would be an enormous benefit to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength and capabilities, he was far more superior than the other masters at the same level, he was even equipped to defeat nature creatures without much effort, but when the enemy was in the Illuminating Soul Realm, the situation was different...</p>

  <p>For example, even though he actually did defeat Seymour today, one could not ignore that he was seriously injured too!</p>

  <p>Besides, Vale was the disciple of the Cloud Sect, and was evidently more powerful than Seymour! Could Luo Zheng be his match and defeat him?</p>

  <p>To be precise, if he wanted an actual shot to save his sister, he would not only have to deal with Vale, but also many other powerful masters in Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Internally, Luo Zheng thought he was still too weak in Cloud Sect...</p>

  <p>Bearing this idea in mind, Luo Zheng, without any hesitation, placed his foot on that talisman.</p>

  <p>Not even a second after he placed his foot on the talisman that his head began to spin. The landscape around him changed within a fast flash and now Luo Zheng found himself in another world.</p>

  <p>In this new contrasting different world, bright flashes of lightning lit up the sky and meteor shower fell in the distance, sounding their presence and the ground shook in waves like those of a majestic sea.</p>

  <p>"The first thing is to test and quantify your strength," Saul's voice came through to Zheng's ears. Luo Zheng very clearly understood that what he was seeing was just an illusion. But even then he could not deny that the environment looked and seemed very real, over a hundred times more real than mirage in Cloud Sect's Bloody Mountain, including the wind, rain, thunder and lightning or vegetation.</p>

  <p>The fact to remember was that it was a test of strength!</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't know how his strength would be tested at this point in this unfamiliar world.</p>

  <p>He walked for a while before his eyes chanced upon a rope. There were many bare-chested men with powerful muscles standing along side the rope. The men appeared quite burly.</p>

  <p>After counting the men standing across from him, Luo Zheng realized there were about a hundred men.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Upon seeing Luo Zheng approaching, the men leading the gang handed the strong rope over to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grabbed the rope and suddenly felt light. His vision got blurry before the landscape changed yet again.</p>

  <p>As his vision became clear again, Luo Zheng was standing on the top of a high mountain, still holding onto the rope. Those burly men were standing across him, holding the rope's other end.</p>

  <p>Between the mountain tops was a ravine. Some preying birds were circling over the cliffs, looking at Luo Zheng insidiously. It felt like they were keenly waiting for the moment he would fall into the ravine, so they could swoop in and peck at his flesh.</p>

  <p>In addition to this horrifying scene, the bottom of the mountain ravine was swirling with molten hot lava...</p>
