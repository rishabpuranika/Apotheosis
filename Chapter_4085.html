<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This kind of movement was not rare among Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>All of them? even hostility-level and resentment-level ones? were capable of acting strangely at certain times. This habit made them difficult to control.</p>

  <p>Manuel had come here several times to attempt to awaken the Monkey Spirit King with three wolf teeth. But after repeated failures, he had decided to give it up.</p>

  <p>Now, however, Manuel saw an opportunity. He looked eagerly at the Eye Spirit, hoping he would be able to take out the nine remaining wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit did not move. Four wolf teeth hovered in front of him, slowly rotating in midair, but he did not hand the rest over.</p>

  <p>Several moments passed. Finally, Manuel became anxious at the wait. He said urgently, "Where are the nine remaining wolf teeth?"</p>

  <p>"I can't give them to you now," the Eye Spirit replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Manuel asked. His voice was very cold.</p>

  <p>He didn't have the patience to wait any longer.</p>

  <p>After all, the Monkey Masters considered it humiliating to ask the help of the creatures from the chaos.</p>

  <p>"By the order of Master Sewell," answered the Eye Spirit. "He said that you must leave here before he hands over the remaining wolf teeth."</p>

  <p>Manuel scowled. So it was Sewell.</p>

  <p>He was one of the strongest Snake Masters in the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he had a status similar to Manuel's in the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Manuel was familiar with Sewell's power and status.</p>

  <p>"Did that snake say that?" Manuel demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am not lying to you," said the Eye Spirit. "The fact is that I work for Master Sewell, and only he has the ability to take out the nine remaining wolf teeth."</p>

  <p>Manuel stared grimly at the Eye Spirit and asked, "Do you have his coordinates?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Contact him and tell him I want to see him," Manuel ordered, not bothering to be polite.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit was unmoved. "Master Sewell does not want to see you.</p>

  <p>That's one of the necessary conditions to wake up the Monkey Spirit King."</p>

  <p>Although the Eye Spirit had seemed very weak before, he was acting aggressive now. Facing Manuel alone, he was stern and unyielding.</p>

  <p>Now that he had mentioned Sewell, it was clear he had no intention of giving way.</p>

  <p>A hint of cautious hesitation rose in Manuel's eyes.</p>

  <p>Even if the Monkey Spirit King hadn't awakened, he was not to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>If the Eye Spirit and his companions dared to play any tricks, they would be courting death.</p>

  <p>With thirteen wolf teeth, the Ghost Master would be resurrected. At that point, nothing else would matter.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Manuel, coming to a decision. "I shall leave."</p>

  <p>He turned and walked towards the door.</p>

  <p>As he left, the door slammed with a bang behind him.</p>

  <p>When Manuel had gone, silence fell over the huge space.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King released a solemn aura, spreading an invisible mood of gloom and grimness throughout the space.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit stared at the Monkey Spirit King above him. A strange golden Sanskrit word appeared in his eyeball. The glowing word spun more and more rapidly, emanating growing brightness, until it turned into a bright golden ball.</p>

  <p>Once the golden ball had stopped spinning, it dissolved and formed itself into three cross stars. The stars were put together with the longest part of each cross star pointing in the same direction. They were pointed at Sewell's coordinates.</p>

  <p>All of the Treacherous Beings had their own coordinates, but most of them were unaware of this. They knew that they would revive in a certain place, but they didn't know where that place would be.</p>

  <p>Only the senior leaders of the Four Spirits Sect knew how to extract the coordinates.</p>

  <p>They would even destroy the coordinates, which was the only effective way to kill the Treacherous Beings once and for all.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, there was a hissing sound.</p>

  <p>A small white snake began emerging from the coordinates.</p>

  <p>He was Sewell.</p>

  <p>As soon as his head was formed, Sewell stared up at the huge Monkey Spirit King, his eyes full of greed.</p>

  <p>"Monkey Spirit King, Orlando. You have done your task well, Eye Spirit," said Sewell.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit accepted the praise calmly. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>"You know, this is the most powerful weapon," Sewell said. "Nothing in the world can surpass it."</p>

  <p>"But as one of the leaders of the Four Spirits Sect, how could the Monkey Spirit King be ordered around by anyone?" the Eye Spirit asked.</p>

  <p>He knew that once the Monkey Spirit King sided with the Snake Spirit Sect, the long-lasting war in the Jade Pure Realm would come to an end.</p>

  <p>But why would a being as powerful as the Monkey Spirit King follow the orders of the Snake Spirit Sect?</p>

  <p>"Of course, the sober Monkey Spirit King won't. However, an unconscious Monkey Spirit King will do as we ask," Sewell replied.</p>

  <p>"So you don't want the Monkey Spirit King to wake up?" the Eye Spirit said, sounding surprised.</p>

  <p>"Of course he can't wake up!" snapped Sewell.</p>

  <p>If the Monkey Spirit King woke up, he would get to know the turmoil and conspiracy that had happened, and he would not let go of the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Awakening the Monkey Spirit King would unleash a formidable enemy against the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit was uncertain about the soundness of this approach, but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>If Sewell said so, then he must be confident.</p>

  <p>Sewell stretched out, and his long body rose, coiling around the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Sewell hissed softly, and the Sanskrit words on his body lit up.</p>

  <p>As the Sanskrit words began to glow, one after another, nine more small pupils appeared in the eyeball of the Eye Spirit. These small pupils dilated to reveal a set of exquisite wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>There was a roaring sound, accompanied by a deep rumbling.</p>

  <p>On his huge throne, the Monkey Spirit King shifted, and each movement was loud and noisy.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King felt the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, which was the thing he was most familiar with.</p>

  <p>In truth, the bloodline auras contained within wolf teeth were rather weak.</p>

  <p>But he was intimately familiar with them because they were his obsession.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's head was tilted downwards, facing the throne.</p>

  <p>But he slowly lifted his head as a pair of enormous eyes began to open.</p>

  <p>His eyes immediately fixed on the sight of the thirteen wolf teeth. He stopped moving, his face filling with uncertainty and confusion.</p>

  <p>However, outside the gate, the Monkey Masters let out cheers of excitement.</p>

  <p>"Our king is about to awaken!"</p>

  <p>"We have been waiting for countless years!"</p>

  <p>"Our long wait is over at last!"</p>

  <p>If they could cry, their faces would be streaked with tears of joy and anticipation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the gate, Sewell spat something out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>Three strands of venom shot out, long and gleaming, like sharp arrows.</p>

  <p>Each strand had a different color. One was dark red, another was pitch black, and the third was colored a vibrant green.</p>

  <p>The strands of venom were thick and dense. As soon as Sewell spat them out, they began solidifying into three slender ropes.</p>

  <p>The rope strands intertwined with one another, their pointed ends aimed towards the wolf teeth. As the braided strand drilled through the small holes in the wolf teeth, stringing them together, it formed a complete Thirteen Teeth Necklace.</p>

  <p>Sewell opened his jaws and took the Thirteen Teeth Necklace gently in his fangs. He slithered towards the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>In the normal course of things, no one dared to approach the Monkey Spirit King unless directly ordered to do so, or they would get trampled to death.</p>

  <p>Even before he had awoken, no one could avoid his kicks, and so they left him alone.</p>

  <p>However, the Monkey Spirit King was still slightly dazed and confused, and he allowed Sewell to approach unharmed.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was not inclined to attack Sewell when he was holding the precious Thirteen Teeth Necklace in his mouth.</p>

  <p>The only sound in the space was of Sewell moving closer and closer.</p>

  <p>He reached the body of the Monkey Spirit King and began twining his snake form around him.</p>

  <p>Eventually he reached the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King. He flicked his head and released the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, throwing it high into the air.</p>

  <p>The necklace rapidly expanded in midair. It soared upwards, increasing in size, then fell down around the neck of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>
