<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's appearance hadn't returned to normal; he was still a ten feet tall monster and in this form, his aura had also undergone a huge change.</p>

  <p>At a glance, Othniel could not recognize him. But under current circumstances, any creature daring to come down could not be ordinary.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>The blue light in Othniel's only eye flickered and a space formed on either side of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If these spaces could restrain him, he'd be able to cut him in half with ease.</p>

  <p>But as soon as they enveloped Luo Zheng's body, they dissipated immediately!</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Othniel was dumbfounded and he quickly thought of Luo Zheng in his mind. Was this monster actually him?</p>

  <p>This thought lingered in his mind when Luo Zheng suddenly grew even more, to a monster more than eight million feet tall!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had previously activated his Wild God Body, he was only capable of expanding to around four million feet high. Before he had activated it this time, he still believed that was his limit.</p>

  <p>He now realized, however, that his body had doubled in size!</p>

  <p>Was it because he had devoured Lamont?</p>

  <p>Othniel had a bad feeling about this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been able to break the Grandmaster of Heaven's Fishing Drum, and the triangular world he had summoned, quite easily. If this horrific monster truly was Luo Zheng, he was now stuck in quite a terrible situation.</p>

  <p>Even more curious were Lamont's features that this monster shared; such as his long, strong arms with the white hair on them.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Othniel asked brazenly, raising his head.</p>

  <p>All Luo Zheng offered was an ugly smile. He then raised his foot and stamped down lightly, creating a huge crater in the space that imprisoned the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>

  <p>"It really is him..."</p>

  <p>Othniel was now sure it was Luo Zheng; only he could break through his space barrier so quickly and easily.</p>

  <p>But why had he become this monstrosity...</p>

  <p>He was still lost in confusion when the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had thrust his sword out, sending countless golden rays of sword radiance bursting out.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The space already had a big hole in it and now the sword radiance obliterated it into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The sharp golden radiance covered Othniel like a net.</p>

  <p>His space barrier could hold the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but it didn't mean he had the power to do as he pleased to him.</p>

  <p>Once the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had pushed his own bloodline to the limit, he displayed an outrageous and terrifying level of swordsmanship. If Othniel wasn't careful, he'd be sliced up for sure.</p>

  <p>He retreated as fast as he could, at the same time clapping his hands and creating space shields ten million feet wide, one after the other.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi chased him down relentlessly, shattering every space shield he came across.</p>

  <p>The golden sword light was like the God of Death, not resting until it had taken him!</p>

  <p>He then went all out, doing all he could to shake off the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi. As he did, he suddenly felt a space fluctuation from above.</p>

  <p>As the Chaos Ancient God in charge of the space truth, Othniel was extremely sensitive to space fluctuations, and as soon as he felt it, he knew it was Luo Zheng who had begun attacking him!</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>He pointed upwards as a reflex and a space fluctuation surrounded Luo Zheng, ready to exile him to a corner of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Othniel had lost sight of the fact that his original intention of attacking the Li Shan mountain was to complete the Element Spirit race's mission - capture Luo Zheng at all costs.</p>

  <p>But he now planned to exile him because he felt threatened!</p>

  <p>It mattered not. As the space fluctuations gathered on Luo Zheng's body, they disappeared instantly, without a trace...</p>

  <p>It was then that Othniel felt clearly that Luo Zheng's body had given off a space fluctuation opposite to his to counter his exile force!</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>Othniel's eye was overflowed with disbelief.</p>

  <p>A power absolutely opposite to his own power of space actually existed in the chaos?</p>

  <p>If he hadn't seen it with his own eye, he wouldn't have believed it. More to it, Luo Zheng had pulled it off so effortlessly.</p>

  <p>Othniel still hung in a state of astonishment when Luo Zheng pounced over and seized him from behind into his tight grip.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>From not far off, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi took this opportunity to attack, the golden sword radiance exploding and inflicting many bloody holes on Othniel's body.</p>

  <p>Othniel then desperately activated his bloodline power to teleport himself away. The blue space truth circled around his body, making him seem like an object about to disappear. His body morphed back and forth between a shadow and a real body of substance, popping in and out of view.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Othniel continued struggling as sixteen ribs as sharp as swords, shot out of Luo Zheng's chest and pierced into his body. Then the barbs that grew from the ribs bound the two bodies firmly together.</p>

  <p>The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been in Luo Zheng's inner world this whole time, so he had a general understanding of the ancestry-level bloodline within him. Even so, what he saw now shocked him to his core. How did this kid have such an attack method?</p>

  <p>Othniel felt the pain and knew something bad was about to happen.</p>

  <p>There was still a considerable gap between him and Lamont in their abilities to use truth-level theurgies.</p>

  <p>Lamont was skilled at controlling temperature. Relying on extreme cold, he was almost immune to all energy attacks. This was why the Divine Crystal Array of King Leuan had failed to hurt him.</p>

  <p>As for Othniel, his skill lay in controlling space and his theurgy was unparalleled in confinement and escape!</p>

  <p>With a roar, Othniel's body suddenly collapsed like a tower made of sand. Every grain of sand within his body turned into a Minimum Space, which was the smallest matter in the chaos. Only then did Othniel finally rid himself of Luo Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>An eight-foot tall person was made up of tens of billions of Minimum Spaces. Othniel's massive body possessed way more than that.</p>

  <p>Innumerable Minimum Spaces, indistinguishable to the naked eye, moved to another spot where Othniel's body gradually reformed. This process was, however, heavily draining for him.</p>

  <p>When he finally looked at Luo Zheng again, fear filled his eye as he realized that if he had not just put everything he had into escaping, he would probably have lost his life. What Luo Zheng said next proved him right.</p>

  <p>"Impressive. Your method is much smarter than Lamont's, but that's it." The voice that rang from his chest sounded very strange.</p>

  <p>Othniel suddenly widened his eye. "Lamont has descended to the Li Shan mountain?</p>

  <p>What happened to him?"</p>

  <p>In his heart he already knew the answer. The white hair and the pair of arms on Luo Zheng's body told him all he needed to know but it was still hard to accept that a Chaos Ancient God had died at Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>After all, for as long as one could recall, a human had never killed a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>As existences that controlled the truth in the chaos, the Chaos Ancient Gods were thought to be invincible.</p>

  <p>"He is dead," Luo Zheng said decisively, giving Othniel the answer he least wanted to hear.</p>
