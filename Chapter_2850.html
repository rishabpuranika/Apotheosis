<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2850 Taking Advantage Of Each Other </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was very apparent that it was not an easy feat to employ and utilize the Blood Splitting Technique.</p>

  <p>Back then, Leyton had adopted a forbidden weapon to be able to employ this grand evil magic of slaughter.</p>

  <p>While on the other hand, the use of the Blood Splitting Technique had caused his cultivation level to decrease considerably. And due to that, Harper and the others had taken advantage of the rare and golden opportunity to seal the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>Samuel, who was seriously afraid of being misunderstood by Leyton, kept silent for a while before he thoughtfully explained, "She is just a creature from the forbidden land..."</p>

  <p>"I know it," declared Leyton flatly. He radiated a neutral attitude towards him.</p>

  <p>Keenly observing Rosie, who stood next to Samuel, it was not hard for them to know what she had now become. After all, she did not have the life force of living beings, but only a manifestation of fear.</p>

  <p>"But what she said is true. The Other Shore Realm warriors located outside the divine land might be very complicated to deal with," Samuel carefully added, silently hoping that he could possibly strike a good deal.</p>

  <p>Based on his assessment, he was now clear that the Yellow Emperor Guards in front of him were not powerful enough to combat against the Other Shore Realm warriors outside.</p>

  <p>In Nicholas's memories, Hamish had told him that what they only needed was powerful energy, and everything would be handled by them.</p>

  <p>And this was why Nicholas had intended to control the Abyss Demon Region at all costs.</p>

  <p>While they were conversing, Samuel couldn't help turning suspicious and cautious at the same time. Although he craved to replace Nicholas, he didn't trust the Yellow Emperor Guards as much as Nicholas did. He even openly mentioned the Other Shore Realm warriors on purpose, trying to sound them out.</p>

  <p>"Well, you don't have to worry about this. If I use the forbidden weapon, even a five-star Yellow Emperor Guard won't be a match for me. Now that the Abyss Demon Region is under your control, they will be no threat at all if you choose to cooperate with me. Besides, we still have another plan,"</p>

  <p>Leyton revealed calmly.</p>

  <p>Samuel merely nodded in reply before he swiftly gazed around as if looking for something. Then he suddenly inquired, "Where is Master Hamish now?</p>

  <p>I should be able to help you remove the Mixed Element Seal."</p>

  <p>"It seems that you know everything about us," countered Leyton. Like Samuel, he was also exercising caution.</p>

  <p>"I told you, I have Nicholas's memories, and I know everything he knew,"</p>

  <p>Samuel claimed rather proudly.</p>

  <p>"We do need your help to remove the Mixed Element Seal, but I'm afraid not today. Hamish has something important to deal with at the moment. I think it would be best if you should go back to the Floating Island first so that you can take over Nicholas's heritage. Hamish will find you later if the need for your help arises," proposed Leyton, reflectively.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Samuel instinctively bowed to him and the other Yellow Emperor Guards. "You're right. I'll return to the Floating Island first and wait for Master Hamish to come."</p>

  <p>With that, he didn't waste another second. He spun around and swiftly left with Rosie and Pascal behind him.</p>

  <p>"Leyton, this guy is not a reliable man. He even dared to sound us out," blurted Zavier with much dissatisfaction as he stared at Samuel's retreating figure disdainfully.</p>

  <p>After seeing the space fluctuation dissipated right after Samuel had left, Leyton fell silent for a while before he slowly explained, "Whether he's reliable or not, this man is useful for us, since he took the initiative to find us and seek our approval. Besides, the Abyss Demon Region is under his control now. For us, this could be the most all-embracing help."</p>

  <p>Samuel's visit today was a mere tentative negotiation between the two parties, but it was totally inevitable that both of them would absolutely agree to cooperate with each other. Leyton understood this very well.</p>

  <p>"Call Hamish over. We have to discuss something with him," ordered Leyton with slight urgency.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Lofty Tree, Hamish was found sitting cross-legged on a branch, with a semicircular jade pendant floating in front of him.</p>

  <p>This jade pendant was none other than the Yellow Emperor Magatama.</p>

  <p>Through it, the Yellow Emperor Guards could easily communicate with each other, even at a distance.</p>

  <p>Just as Samuel had worried, Leyton and the rest indeed had no confidence to fight against the Other Shore Realm warriors outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>In recent days, Hamish had always utilized the Yellow Emperor Magatama to send messages, hoping to find any other Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>However, the divine land had floated in the chaos for too long, so its location was now extremely remote. The possible chances of finding the other Yellow Emperor Guards were too small.</p>

  <p>But even if there was very little hope, Hamish adamantly refused to give up.</p>

  <p>He had been activating the Yellow Emperor Magatama all the time, sending some messages to the outside.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he abruptly heard Zavier summon him. He carefully put away the Yellow Emperor Magatama and immediately rushed toward the top of the Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>As soon as he got there, he was taken aback by the sudden news that Nicholas was already dead.</p>

  <p>On top of that, he was even more shocked when he heard about Samuel's visit and his current control of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"How could it be him who managed to control the forbidden land?" Hamish was bewildered and found it complicated to figure out.</p>

  <p>"Now that he killed Nicholas, the other Holy Beings of the union won't surely agree to follow him. In that case, right after the Holy Beings are reborn some days later, you should go to the Floating Islands to calm them down," Leyton firmly ordered.</p>

  <p>For the Yellow Emperor Guards, the Holy Beings of the union were also part of their force.</p>

  <p>Maybe Samuel was not afraid of the Holy Beings, but the Yellow Emperor Guards would be reluctant to see them clashing against each other. It was something they didn't want to see.</p>

  <p>"Ok, I will," Hamish solemnly replied with cupped hands.</p>

  <p>On the other side, on their way back to the Floating Islands, Rosie couldn't contain it any longer and spoke to Samuel in a cold voice, "Do you really think they would accept you as a new Nicholas? They just want to take advantage of you!"</p>

  <p>Holding the Spear of Supreme Harmony firmly in his hand, Samuel replied calmly, "Everyone in this world should take advantage of each other, right?</p>

  <p>The reason why I didn't kill you or destroy your cultivation is that I still want to take advantage of your power. My ability to control the Abyss Demon Region is the sole reason they want to cooperate with me. On the other hand, I want them to help me become the ruler of the divine land in Nicholas's place. With this, I take advantage of them, as well."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," Rosie countered, frowning.</p>

  <p>She instinctively believed that after the Yellow Emperor Guards achieved their aim, it would be Samuel's end. She didn't say it out loud, anyway.</p>

  <p>Samuel softly chuckled but didn't argue any further. He then took the two of them straight to the Floating Island instead.</p>

  <p>At the same moment.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Lorena, and the others had returned to the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island from the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>Since Mike had been set free, Lorena was in a rather good mood. Her heart was in bliss at the mere thought of it.</p>

  <p>She fully understood that it wouldn't be long before Mike returned with a new body. They only needed to wait patiently.</p>

  <p>At this time, it suddenly occurred to Lorena that she hadn't visited the fairy palace yet.</p>

  <p>And as a mother-in-law, she had never seen her daughters-in-law and grandson.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was because she was in a good mood after she returned to the Floating Island, Lorena warned Pierson, who had accompanied them all the way with such respect. She thoughtfully said, "If I were you, I would have all the disciples of the clan removed from the Floating Island."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Pierson inquired curiously.</p>

  <p>Lorena followed the rest into the transmission array leading to the Swirl Forest. She calmly added, "Samuel is still alive. If I'm not wrong, his son has controlled the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>"Really? But does it have anything to do with our clan?" The confusion was clearly evident in Pierson's eyes as he thought to himself, 'As far as I know, Samuel is also a member of the alliance.'</p>

  <p>Fluctuations of space began to spread from the transmission array leading to the Swirl Forest, which were about to shroud them. At this time, Zheng turned back and added, "Samuel has another name, and that's Gregorio Yue."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the transmission array had been activated fully and enveloped Zheng and the rest, who then completely disappeared from the spot, leaving no trace behind.</p>

  <p>Pierson was briefly stunned for a moment. As he mumbled the name to himself, he suddenly seemed to recall something, and his face darkened immediately.</p>

  <p>Inside the transmission channel, Iris still wondered what Gregorio stood for, so she gently asked Tianming in a low voice. After Tianming quietly explained for her, Iris's face turned ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>If what Tianming said was true, she knew there was no way that her clan could be spared this time.</p>
