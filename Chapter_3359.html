<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Feng Ge accepted them as disciples just on a whim, not formally.</p>

  <p>But after some time, they developed quite a good relationship.</p>

  <p>Now, when Feng Ge saw that Nelly and the other two were going to leave soon, sadness overcame her. "There's no need for you to leave," she said, like an afterthought.</p>

  <p>"But..." Nelly gave Luo Zheng a look.</p>

  <p>Before the latter could say anything, Feng Ge walked up to take Nelly's hand and stood before Xun and Liusu. She glared at Luo Zheng coldly and said,</p>

  <p>"Although I can't call myself their master, we've been getting along well these days. You can't just take them with you."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's behavior both angered and amused Luo Zheng in return. He knew that at the beginning, she took them to the Phoenix Palace with an ulterior motive.</p>

  <p>"I've offended Lady Jean. If they stay in the Phoenix Palace, I can't guarantee their safety," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>The narrow-minded Jean carried much resentment in her heart. Since she couldn't take it out on Luo Zheng, she was likely to cause Nelly, Xun, and Liusu some trouble. Luo Zheng didn't want to allow that to happen.</p>

  <p>"I promise I'll keep them safe and sound at the palace," Feng Ge assured him.</p>

  <p>"How? When the Chaotic Source World opens, won't you also leave the Taiyi Heaven Palace? How will you protect them then?" Luo Zheng questioned skeptically.</p>

  <p>"I will leave them to my mother, and I won't let anything happen to them,"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge said firmly. Turning to Xun and the other two, she said softly,</p>

  <p>"Please stay in the Phoenix Palace."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's determination piqued Luo Zheng's curiosity.</p>

  <p>It seemed the damage to her Memory Flame somehow affected her personality as well.</p>

  <p>When Liusu, Nelly, and Xun heard Feng Ge's request, they exchanged uncertain glances. "Luo Zheng," Nelly then uttered, "we'd better stay at the Phoenix Palace for now..."</p>

  <p>Seeing Feng Ge's sincerity, the three felt unwilling to leave. Pursing his lips, Luo Zheng merely shrugged and agreed.</p>

  <p>Although he could give them good cultivation resources, he knew that they could learn a lot more at the Phoenix Palace than with him. If Feng Ge was that certain she could take care of them, then Luo Zheng would let them have that opportunity.</p>

  <p>After he returned to the Flow Sword Sect, Luo Zheng began sorting out the Other Shore Tokens he had obtained in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Civilization Artifact, the two Hearts of Accomplice along with the Regal Jade Beast Feng Ge had killed were the most precious objects.</p>

  <p>Upon their death, the Regal Jade creatures would turn into statues which served as their corpses.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng fused with the statue, it would greatly strengthen the defense level of his physical body. He could even transform into a Regal Jade body. This was known as an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Such an Other Shore Token was indeed rare, but Luo Zheng could only fuse with three Other Shore Tokens. The Strength God Totem was responsible for his power's eruption, the demonic eye could disturb his opponent's mind at the most critical moments, and the Civilization Artifact served as Luo Zheng's core token.</p>

  <p>The three of them were indispensable, so before entering the Desire World, he did not intend to replace any of them.</p>

  <p>The two Hearts of Accomplice were even more precious.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had Dorothy give one of the two to the Origin Mountain, planning to keep the other. After Winchell knew of the matter, he, Athemar, and Goran went to purchase it right away.</p>

  <p>It was an important item for a super force? it was only natural that Athemar and the rest were eager to possess it.</p>

  <p>Such a token could give one the ability to kill a top-level opponent by sacrificing their own life. While it was a powerful weapon for a super force, it wasn't exactly suitable for Luo Zheng's needs. He would've never allowed his companions to fuse with it at the cost of their lives.</p>

  <p>Before the opening of the Chaotic Source World, Luo Zheng began his cultivation as well.</p>

  <p>It wasn't particularly difficult to comprehend the Blood Essence Godly Way, but fusing it with the other Divine Dao was another matter. While he had enough time, Luo Zheng still had extreme difficulty fusing successfully.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also needed to enter the Flow Tower to cultivate the Flow Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>But with Yudie and Margaret's company, it seemed as though time went by too fast.</p>

  <p>After two months, Milo finally recovered and returned.</p>

  <p>The last time he used a secret skill, his soul was damaged severely, putting him in a long-lasting coma. The Flow Sword Sect poured many efforts into his recovery, paying a great price for it.</p>

  <p>He then began his cultivation in seclusion after visiting Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, there were only two months left before the Chaotic Source World was opened to the public. Naturally, Milo wasn't willing to miss the opportunity, so he wasted no time improving his cultivation base and strength.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, the atmosphere in the Taiyi Heaven Palace became quiet.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the disciples who had reached Stage Thirteen were cultivating.</p>

  <p>A ticket to the Chaotic Source World was highly precious? the Taiyi Heaven Palace wasn't exempted from striving hard for more tickets. But in the end, they couldn't garner enough. A bulk would be eliminated and couldn't go to the Chaotic Source World. Of course, no one wanted to come across that misfortune.</p>

  <p>And it wasn't only the Taiyi Heaven Palace; all the super forces in the Source World were facing a similar situation.</p>

  <p>Even these super forces had competed for the tickets behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>Some small clans and forces bought the tickets even when the prices spiked up sky-high in the black market of the Ear Mouse race.</p>

  <p>In the Black Mountain Guild, the stink lingered atop the Black Mountain.</p>

  <p>Numerous corpses were piled up there, forming a little mountain of their own.</p>

  <p>They belonged to huge beetles, evil wolves, and other creatures of various strange shapes.</p>

  <p>When they were alive, all these creatures were extraordinarily strong, having reached at least the twelfth or thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>But they had all fallen during the vicious battle on the Black Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Awoo!"</p>

  <p>With a final, great roar, a huge fierce ape rushed toward the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Even as the ape was severely injured, it was unwilling to accept the fact.</p>

  <p>So long as it killed the human being in front of it, it could gain the ticket to the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Another step and it could succeed.</p>

  <p>The Evil God watched the approaching fierce ape with a wicked smile.</p>

  <p>When he pointed at it gently, his soul aura burst from his body.</p>

  <p>It was extraordinarily strong. It flowed and rushed toward the fierce ape.</p>

  <p>The moment the creature was enveloped by the aura, it almost lost itself.</p>

  <p>"Why is his Soul of Light... so powerful?"</p>

  <p>In the ape's confusion, it felt a sharp pain at the back of its head. Its consciousness was then smashed in an instant. Its huge and strong head fell to pieces.</p>

  <p>The Evil God merely stepped on the ape's corpse and continued up to the peak of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Now, he alone stood proudly on the Black Mountain.</p>

  <p>The monsters and beasts of the Black Mountain Guild all looked up at him from afar.</p>

  <p>"It's too easy," said the Evil God as he stood atop the mountain. He then took out the token of the Black Mountain Guild and crushed it in his hand with pride. Looking up to the sky, he mumbled, "Will you be late?"</p>

  <p>The Black Ship was approaching him from the sky.</p>

  <p>It was moving rapidly, almost ominously.</p>

  <p>When it stopped right by the Black Mountain, Shera, clad in a long black dress, descended from it and stopped right above the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Don't stand above me," growled the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap. Take it and come with us."</p>

  <p>Without another word, she threw a black card at him. It was a ticket to the Chaotic Source World.</p>
