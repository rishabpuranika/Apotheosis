<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1138 Heavenly Thunder Halberd </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The cyan dragon's warning brought puzzlement to Zheng's face. He asked warily, "What's wrong? What happened?"</p>

  <p>"The language that the Ghost Beast spoke belongs to the dragon race," the cyan dragon explained hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"The language of the Genuine Dragon?" Zheng knew that the Genuine Dragon race had their own language. But when he had entered the Genuine Dragon World last time, he hadn't found it difficult to communicate with the Dragon Lineage Human. So it hadn't occurred to him that the Genuine Dragon race could have a language that was unique to them.</p>

  <p>"That's right. The Ghost Beast is summoning other beasts from the Spirit Beast Area. If you don't leave now, I'm afraid you won't be able to leave later!" The cyan dragon warned.</p>

  <p>When the cyan dragon had finished speaking, Zheng turned to find that the Ghost Beast was being struck by lightning over and over again. His face hardened with determination as he said to Randy and the others, "Let's go! Everyone, let's leave this place! Quick!"</p>

  <p>Randy became curious when he heard Zheng urging them to leave. Zheng hadn't been in a hurry just moments ago. So why had he suddenly become so anxious?</p>

  <p>"Hurry up and leave! That Ghost Beast is summoning other Ghost Beasts," Zheng urged.</p>

  <p>Randy was still apprehensive but when he saw the seriousness etched across Zheng's face, he didn't ask any more questions and made to leave.</p>

  <p>But just as he was about to leave with the rest, he turned around and saw Bram, the crown prince of the Harlan Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Bram had led Gregory, Edwin and the other members of his group to gather around the Ghost Beast. It looked like they also wanted to get some Ghost Beads from the Ghost Beast.</p>

  <p>Although there was a huge conflict between Randy and Bram, in the end, they were half-brothers, and both were wary of that fact. This made Randy say a few words to Bram through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Bram glanced at Randy in surprise and frowned, but he still seemed to believe what Randy was saying. He then made to leave along with his group.</p>

  <p>But just as Bram and his men turned to leave, he heard the Ghost Beast let out a deafening roar that reverberated across the sky.</p>

  <p>"It's dying! Everyone, come on!" Fredric shouted excitedly.</p>

  <p>"No matter how many Ghost Beads we get, all those who have attacked the beast can share them equally!"</p>

  <p>"You mean they can be divided equally among us? Are you dreaming?</p>

  <p>The one who is most powerful obviously gets more Ghost Beads!"</p>

  <p>But the expected didn't happen. The lightning didn't kill the Ghost Beast.</p>

  <p>Instead, it fell to the ground after a series of roars. At the same time, the weeds within a radius of several hundred feet suddenly began to grow at a crazy rate.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>No one was able to fly because of the blood sacrifice. They could only keep running around the Ghost Beast. Within three seconds, the weeds had grown to a height of ten feet, enveloping all the warriors who were within a radius of a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>The layers of weeds firmly fettered them.</p>

  <p>"AAH!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of here quickly!"</p>

  <p>Every warrior was struggling desperately against the weeds and it was not easy for them to break free.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Beast walked slowly towards a warrior who was surrounded by tens of thousands of weeds. The warrior was unable to break free in the short time it took for the beast to walk up. He could only watch helplessly as the Ghost Beast slowly raised its palm and hit his body hard.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Beast moved slowly, but was astounding strong. With just a slash of its palm, the beast had split the warrior into two and then walked towards the next warrior.</p>

  <p>Bram had left, his men following him, and had avoided the growing weeds. It was all thanks to Randy's warning but Randy himself was now trapped in the weeds.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The warriors who were trapped within the weeds wouldn't sit still and simply wait for their deaths. Some warriors who were skilled in the Fire Law suddenly released raging flames from their bodies and began to burn the damned weeds.</p>

  <p>"Don't burn them! It's scalding me to death!"</p>

  <p>"How can we get out of here if we don't burn them?"</p>

  <p>"The Ghost Beast is coming towards me. Help!"</p>

  <p>There was complete chaos in the weeds because everyone wanted to break free. Some powerful warriors and those with powerful weapons had escaped. But most warriors were still trapped in the weeds because they couldn't defend themselves or escape in time.</p>

  <p>As they struggled, the sudden mournful screams rent the air. The sky was filled with a black mass, a group of Ghost Beasts that flew towards them.</p>

  <p>The trapped warriors were now in genuine despair, hope draining away from them bit by bit.</p>

  <p>"Stop looking. Let's run away right now!" When Zheng left, he patted Fiona on the shoulder. She had previously been worried about the Ghost Beast, but now, she was worried about the safety of those warriors.</p>

  <p>But now was not the time to worry about others. The number of Ghost Beasts in the black mass hovering above could be close to tens of thousands. Anyone caught by them would surely end up dead.</p>

  <p>The group of warriors swiftly left that place.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had traveled hardly six or seven miles when he heard a loud vibrating sound emanating from behind him.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>Zheng turned just in time to see incomparably thick thunder and lightning shooting towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The force of the explosion caused the grass in the entire Spirit Beast Area to tremble and the Ghost Beasts that were circling in the air disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>'The thunder and lightning!' Zheng's heart thundered against his chest as he saw that dazzling light.</p>

  <p>When Randy saw the thick thunder and lightning, a smile appeared on his face. He then said softly, "That is Fredric's doing."</p>

  <p>"Is he really that powerful?" Zheng asked. The power of the thunder and lightning was probably on par with the full power of a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>Randy shook his head and chuckled. "He is the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom. Of course he is very remarkably powerful!"</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the secret sect was built within the York Divine Kingdom, a kingdom that was home to Marine. The York Divine Kingdom was able to stand out among the four divine kingdoms mainly because of the secret sect.</p>

  <p>The York Divine Kingdom had the right to be the first to select the resources passed down from the Reverse Spirit Channel. As the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom, Fredric naturally had all sorts of good weapons and treasures.</p>

  <p>Randy continued, "If I'm not mistaken, he has used up the Heavenly Thunder Halberd just now, which can only be used once and is ranked as a semi-divine weapon."</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised to learn this information about the weapon. No wonder it possessed such power!</p>

  <p>But if Fredric hadn't used this weapon, he would have become a corpse.</p>

  <p>The members of the royal families did indeed have a lot of good things.</p>

  <p>Callan, Fiona, and Randy might also have other weapons that could save their lives when in danger.</p>

  <p>The thunder and lightning had eliminated most of the Ghost Beasts in the Spirit Beast Area, causing everyone to heave a collective sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Everyone maintained a certain speed as they advanced through the grass of the Spirit Beast Area. Fiona piped up, "Can we enter the secret land after passing through the Spirit Beast Area?"</p>

  <p>Randy nodded and said, "Theoretically speaking, yes. After we pass through the Spirit Beast Area, we will arrive at the center of the island.</p>

  <p>We can find the entrance to the Feather Emperor Secret Land there."</p>

  <p>They did not encounter any trouble in the later part of their journey and passed through the Spirit Beast Area easily. Soon after, a magnificent sight welcomed everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>Lines formed from all sorts of jades and lights outlined a world that looked like paradise. Every pavilion glowed colorfully. Usually, if a place was rich in color, it would look vulgar, at least to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>But this? This wielded a power that made everyone feel comfortable as they gazed at the perfect color matching.</p>

  <p>"It's so beautiful!" Fiona was the first to rush in as she took in this scene.</p>

  <p>Her eyes flickered with emotion. Their journey had caused everyone to tense up, but beholding this beautiful scene caused them to relax.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly walked up and carefully observed the buildings in front of him. The buildings of the Dragon Lineage Human were quite exquisite, and the materials used to build them were mixed with luminous sand of various colors.</p>

  <p>The luminous sand absorbed the sunlight during the day and could reflect different kinds of lights at night. The sand still looked dazzling even after thousands of years.</p>

  <p>"Here is the entrance." It was not the first time that Randy had been to this place. He was already used to the scenery. He gestured to everyone and led them to the entrance of the Feather Emperor Secret Land.</p>
