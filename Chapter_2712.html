<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2712 A Dangerous Act </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone gasped in astonishment upon witnessing the tragic end of the three top-rank True Gods in the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>Even Leland looked a bit scared.</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being, Leland could protect himself so long as he did not venture into the forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>Those four-legged Earth Ghosts were powerful but they did not really pose any big threat to him.</p>

  <p>However, the Lethal Fire Magma was different. Any sort of contact with the magma would be enough to burn him to death...</p>

  <p>"Drip, drip, drip..."</p>

  <p>The viscous, molten liquid rushed out of the layer of soft stones and erupted through the cracks on the ground.</p>

  <p>A scorching aura emanated from the earth.</p>

  <p>Everyone moved to higher ground and some even chose to float in the air.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>More Earth Ghosts emerged from the layer of soft stones, creating more holes on the wall.</p>

  <p>Each hole created emitted a faint, green light.</p>

  <p>This was enough to tell everyone present that another wave of Lethal Fire Magma was soon to erupt into the cave!</p>

  <p>"We're doomed! It's all over! We're doomed!" One of the top-rank True Gods despaired.</p>

  <p>"Let's fight them to death!"</p>

  <p>"How? Can you resist magma?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was at a loss, even Luo Zheng could only look around with a frown.</p>

  <p>Was this really how all would end? No way!</p>

  <p>He never expected things to end up like this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed and he stretched out his hand, using it to sweep through the ground.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>This layer of soft stones was extremely tough. Back then, it took Harold quite a lot of strength to break through it.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng saw it fit to go all out. He pulled out a pillar of soft stone which was as high as a person. After that, he stretched out his hand and activated the Power Shaping.</p>

  <p>He pointed his finger towards the pillar and cut away on the soft stone.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's finger served as a kind of carving knife that cut through the stone and shaped it like a piece of meat.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes lit up when they saw what Luo Zheng was doing.</p>

  <p>"That's right! This layer of soft stones can resist the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>We can use the stone as a shield," Jalen exclaimed with joy.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful strength! And he can even shape things at will!"</p>

  <p>Leland couldn't help but remark in awe.</p>

  <p>If he went all out, he too could tear the soft stone into pieces but he couldn't do it with the same finesse that Luo Zheng showed just now.</p>

  <p>With a mere eight strikes, Luo Zheng successfully cut the stone into nine pieces before patting down the sides.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The hard and strong stone pieces immediately shot towards the crowd.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not care about these other people but this cave was too unpredictable. It would be impossible for him to simply rely on himself to escape unscathed.</p>

  <p>Cameron received one of the stone pieces and felt his arms immediately strain from the weight. He never expected it to be so heavy! Just how much strength did Luo Zheng exert to cut into this stone?</p>

  <p>When all stone pieces had been distributed, the densely-packed holes began to spurt out streams of Lethal Fire Magma!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...</p>

  <p>These spurts of molten lava gushed out on all sides!</p>

  <p>"Everyone come together! Each person should block a side!"</p>

  <p>Leland ordered, carrying a stone piece to block his left side.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Jalen rushed towards Leland and blocked his right side with his own stone piece.</p>

  <p>The others followed suit, pairing up to block the flow of lava from all sides.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>There was a sick, sizzling sound as Lethal Fire Magma poured out and splashed onto the stone pieces.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods gripped the stone pieces with their life, their hands even trembling slightly as they waited for the lava flow to subside.</p>

  <p>Just one touch of this Lethal Fire Magma could kill them! Of course, these True Gods would be nervous.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted his own stone piece and leaned against Cameron. Unlike everyone's rigid faces, Luo Zheng looked rather calm.</p>

  <p>The more dangerous the situation, the more composed one should be.</p>

  <p>There was a better chance of surviving a crisis if one kept a level head.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, move at a constant speed and pass this place!" Luo Zheng ordered with a firm but calm voice.</p>

  <p>"He's right! Jalen and I will lead the way!" Leland affirmed.</p>

  <p>Thus, these nine people advanced as they floated in mid-air.</p>

  <p>All the while, Lethal Fire Magma continued to spurt and splash in all directions. They had to be extremely careful or the molten liquid would reach the people behind the stone pieces and burn them instantly.</p>

  <p>Due to their cautiousness, their speed reverted to that of a snail's.</p>

  <p>With such a slow and easy target, the four-legged Earth Ghosts that crawled on the cave walls couldn't help themselves and flew into a frenzy.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>After the first four-legged Earth Ghost took a move, the others followed and pounced on everyone again!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud noise and a four-legged Earth Ghost slammed onto a shield.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God who held the said shield panicked and he dropped the stone piece almost instantly.</p>

  <p>With the shield gone, the Lethal Fire Magma spurted and splashed toward everyone.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cursed when he saw what happened.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Leland, Jalen, and the other True Gods felt shocked and extremely frustrated at what happened.</p>

  <p>It was already extremely hard to advance while lifting the stone pieces but what were they going to do now that magma showered over them?</p>

  <p>To panic now would most probably mean death!</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Luo Zheng shouted, "Everyone! Place the stone shields outward and gather in the middle. Don't panic!"</p>

  <p>His words contained strong soul force that struck into everyone's minds.</p>

  <p>Even Leland felt some kind of pain coming from his soul.</p>

  <p>However, it was under this pain that everyone forgot their fears and no longer panicked. All of them got in formation and formed a circle.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there were still a few who surrendered to their fears. One consummate True God screamed and threw away the stone piece he had before rushing towards another direction.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng simply ignored this foolish consummate True God and jumped with the stone piece in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The stone piece spun in the air and blocked the falling Lethal Fire Magma drops, preventing any from falling onto everyone's heads.</p>

  <p>As for that one guy who rushed out, his agility couldn't save him and ended up bumping into a few four-legged Earth Ghosts. It was then that a stream of Lethal Fire Magma swept through him with a nasty sizzle.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle!"</p>

  <p>They watched as dark green flames immediately engulfed the consummate True God's body.</p>

  <p>He quickly turned into a puddle of green fluid that dripped onto the ground.</p>

  <p>"Tobias!"</p>

  <p>"Why did you rush out like that!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>This horrendous sight filled everyone with grief but it also served as an important lesson for them to keep their heads in this extremely pressured situation.</p>

  <p>Some others had wanted to rush out and flee from instinct.</p>

  <p>It was only because of Luo Zheng's soul attack that they forgot about this urge and maintained their formation.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The situation had somewhat stabilized but the four-legged Earth Ghosts remained a problem.</p>

  <p>They continued to clash and smash against the stone pieces everyone held for protection.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng, Leland, and Jalen countered with their own attacks and drove the four-legged Earth Ghosts away.</p>

  <p>These creatures were thick-skinned but not even them could resist the heat of the Lethal Fire Magma. Some of the four-legged Earth Ghosts bounced off the stone pieces and came into contact with magma, turning into puddles of green fluid instantly.</p>
