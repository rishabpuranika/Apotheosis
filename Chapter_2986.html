<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2986 A Trap </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just then, the ferocious ghost bound by the fire chains let out another roar.</p>

  <p>"Ahahah..."</p>

  <p>The ghost emitted a strong force of soul that made the two chains binding it vibrate.</p>

  <p>The two consummate True Gods had identical looks of tension on their faces. They tightly gripped the chains in their hands, and the flames on the two chains blazed even stronger.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Master Allen, the ghost's soul force is growing stronger!"</p>

  <p>"The Flaming Sun Chains probably cannot hold it!"</p>

  <p>The faces of the two consummate True Gods lost their color.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the soul force of the ghost was relatively weak. The two consummate True Gods had a talent for dealing with all sorts of evil spirits, so they had thought that they would be able to capture the ghost.</p>

  <p>They never expected the ghost's soul force to increase continuously. Its strength far exceeded their expectations.</p>

  <p>For now, the ghost was still bound by Flaming Sun Chains. If it managed to break free from the chains, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Allen, the purple-robed man, looked grim. He cast a glance at the ghost in mid-air and gave an order, "Artie, go and execute the intruders.</p>

  <p>I'll subdue the ghost myself!"</p>

  <p>After issuing his command, he stretched out his hand and tapped gently.</p>

  <p>Two jade hooks appeared. He leaped high and threw the jade hooks toward the ghost.</p>

  <p>Following Allen's orders, Artie took out a long golden stick and addressed the people who broke in, "Guido is my brother. I don't know how you got in here, but I hope you can tell me where he is. In return, I will leave your corpses intact."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his menacing words, Kenelm and his companions took some steps back.</p>

  <p>Actually, the situation had been completely out of the control since they entered the cave.</p>

  <p>For Kenelm and the other consummate True Gods, this was nothing but a thrilling, somewhat dangerous adventure. However, the strength of the group brought here by Tanner was completely beyond what they expected, and the soul force released by the ghost was even more terrifying.</p>

  <p>If Kenelm had known that the ghost would become this powerful, then he might have eschewed the idea altogether.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and the others had retreated, but Zheng hadn't. No. 9527's voice played in his head, "These people cannot subdue the ghost. They'll all die here."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt strongly threatened by the soul force released by the ghost, but Allen seemed confident that he could subdue it.</p>

  <p>"The Stinger Guard who arranged this tomb was evil," No. 9527 explained.</p>

  <p>"He didn't want his belongings to be destroyed, so he deliberately set up this array to turn a strand of his soul into a ghost. This ghost devours the souls of living people to improve his strength. Many people must have stumbled into this cave in the past few years, but very few of them have made it out alive. I'm afraid the ghost's strength can even become several times stronger."</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Zheng was taken aback, and he ended up second-guessing his ability to take down the ghost. If the spirit's power became several times stronger, then he might not be able to fight back.</p>

  <p>"It means that this cave is not a tomb, but a trap to improve the ghost's cultivation," said No. 9527 with finality.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng standing still and looking behind him, Artie assumed that the other man did not take him seriously. His face was filled with anger.</p>

  <p>"Where is Guido?" he demanded. "Answer me!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he uttered these words, he transformed into a golden flash of light and flew toward Zheng, leaving a golden shadow inside the cave. He waved his long golden stick and brandished it at Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Kenelm was shocked at what he saw. He didn't know why Zheng was in a daze at such a crucial moment.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Artie dropped his stick. The golden stick shadow was mixed with some blue space fragments, which was a result of the Truth of Void Destruction. The incredible power contained in the strike was enough to destroy anything it touched.</p>

  <p>Seeing the long golden stick coming at him, Zheng reached out his right hand and grasped it tightly with a thud.</p>

  <p>With several snaps, the space fragments around the long golden stick slashed at Zheng's arm. Only some beams of golden light touched his arm, and it was not harmed in the slightest.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was in the divine land, his strength already far exceeded that of an ordinary consummate True God. He was able to fight a Holy Being head on.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, with the power of the original will of the divine land at his disposal, even the masters at the Other Shore Realm were no match for him.</p>

  <p>After leaving the divine land, he could not use the power of the original will and the supreme treasures of belief. However, a consummate True God like Artie was still no match for him.</p>

  <p>Artie scoffed at Zheng's foolish behavior inwardly, 'Doesn't he know that my powerful strike can cut him into pieces? He dared to grab my stick with his bare hand. What a fool.'</p>

  <p>He was astounded to see Zheng successfully take his stick into his hand unharmed.</p>

  <p>Artie's eyes widened in shock. He could not believe that someone at the same cultivation level as him could take his full blow with a bare hand. Not even Allen could do that.</p>

  <p>He raised his hands and tried to reclaim the long stick back from Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng seemed to be grasping it casually, and the long stick was firmly stuck to his hand and would not budge.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Artie indifferently and raised the hand that was holding the long stick. Before Artie could let go, his body was lifted up by the long stick and was sent flying over a hundred feet before smashing into the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and his companions stared in shock, eyes wide, at what they had witnessed.</p>

  <p>Kenelm finally realized that Zheng had defeated Guido not because of sheer luck or the other's flaws. His strength was far beyond that of the other consummate True Gods at his cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Zheng came from a land outside of the Source World. Was he a talent of a great race in the chaos? Kenelm's mind came up with a guess.</p>

  <p>Not far away, the purple-robed man had his two jade hooks firmly locked to the ghost. The jade hooks seemed to be specifically used to suppress evil spirits. After the ghost was hooked, it issued hissing sounds, as if the soul was being burned.</p>

  <p>The ghost moaned and seemed to choke out its last gasp.</p>

  <p>"You may be wrong. He appears to have subdued the ghost," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"I was mistaken?" No. 9527 asked, surprised. "That's impossible. Although I don't know how the tomb and its traps are arranged, I, as a soul, am more sensitive about such things than you." It calmly proceeded to instruct Zheng,</p>

  <p>"Look at the sword on the tomb."</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was once again focused on the cyan sword. He saw a light flicker across the sword, and the moribund ghost suddenly swelled up.</p>

  <p>Just as No. 9527 had speculated, a soul force that was more than four or five times stronger burst forth from the ghost.</p>
