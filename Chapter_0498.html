<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 498 Not Interested To Know You </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At that time, Melvin had the exact same idea as Luo Zheng in the past.</p>

  <p>'I have broken the rules of the Luo Clan so I was downgraded to a slave.</p>

  <p>I serve as a training tool, and it is my destiny.</p>

  <p>As a training tool, the children of the Luo Clan beat me for training or testing their strength. But there is someone who can not beat me!' Melvin thought.</p>

  <p>When he heard Melvin's words, Miles hit the slave with a powerful blow before shouting, "Melvin, you're honored to be beaten by Darcy!</p>

  <p>If you say anything more, I will beat you to death!"</p>

  <p>The blow had Melvin doubling over.</p>

  <p>But he was also a hothead. Through gritted teeth, he shouted back,</p>

  <p>"Miles Luo! You have humiliated the entire Luo Clan! You're even worse than your brother Perrin. The people Perrin had good relations with were the great ones from the noble clans of the Imperial Capital. Who is your brother Darcy? He is only a man from the Huang Clan of C County! The Huang Clan is low-ranked, and people from that clan have not been given the right to talk to members of the Luo Clan. And now you're kissing his ass?</p>

  <p>Bah!" Melvin smirked.</p>

  <p>His remarks caught Darcy's attention.</p>

  <p>"Our Huang Clan is so low and not qualified to talk to your Luo Clan?"</p>

  <p>This time, Darcy's expression turned cold.</p>

  <p>Seeing Darcy's face, Miles hurriedly gave a smile and bent over. "Darcy, do not mind this guy. He just had to say something. I will punish him harshly later!" he assured. It was necessary for Miles to speak to Darcy carefully.</p>

  <p>"No, let me do it. I'll teach him what unqualified means!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished saying this, Darcy started to focus his life energy and soon reached a high spirit.</p>

  <p>Darcy Huang was the young master of the Huang Clan, which had developed quickly in the past years in C County. But no one knew where the master of the Huang Clan found resources that allowed him to achieve three levels continuously. Now, he was at the fifth grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>The master of the Huang Clan was probably the fighter with the highest level in C County!</p>

  <p>Given the circumstances, the Huang Clan was naturally flourishing gradually, and other clans had to admit them to be the number-one clan and play up to them. As a result, the Huang Clan stood to receive most of the benefits in the county.</p>

  <p>And most of them belonged to the Luo Clan. In other words, the Luo Clan's wealth had been swallowed up by other clans in C County, and the Huang Clan had amassed it.</p>

  <p>Despite the situation, the Luo Clan would never dare say anything unfavorable. And this was the reason why Miles had to flatter Darcy. The moment he antagonized Darcy, the Huang Clan would be annoyed, and the ending would be worse for the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>And because Miles was good at pleasing Darcy, and building a good relationship with him, the Huang Clan didn't eat up all of the Luo Clan's property.</p>

  <p>However, this just prolonged the agony of the Luo Clan, because they were on the way to decline soon.</p>

  <p>In Darcy's view, the Luo Clan was a bunch of deplorable people, including Miles. But since Miles always said something to please him tremendously, Darcy didn't mind being followed around by him.</p>

  <p>Now all of a sudden, a human punchbag had the nerve to look down on the Huang Clan?</p>

  <p>Did he really want to die?</p>

  <p>Out of all the big clans inside C County, who would dare say anything bad to his face? Certainly not the destitute Luo Clan, or so he thought.</p>

  <p>With Darcy focusing his strength, his life energy became more powerful and could hit Melvin with enough force to take him down.</p>

  <p>And Darcy's potential power did not go unnoticed by Melvin, whose face turned pale.</p>

  <p>He knew that Darcy hitting him on the body could mean his death!</p>

  <p>But while this was the case, Melvin refused to humble himself. Gritting his teeth, he vowed not to beg for mercy. He was aware begging would never work on someone like Darcy. So Melvin would rather not humiliate himself before dying.</p>

  <p>With his innate superhuman strength and exceptionally strong form, Melvin still held on to slim hope that he could withstand the onslaught of punches Darcy would surely give him.</p>

  <p>He leaned back slightly, so his chest appeared somewhat inclined. The posture would help diminish the power of Darcy's blow, which he would surely deliver at full strength.</p>

  <p>With a mocking smile, Darcy roared, "Nothing you do can save you!</p>

  <p>You're only an ant to me. I will have to die if I can't beat you to death!"</p>

  <p>He already had a killing intent.</p>

  <p>"Heart-broken Fist!" he hollered.</p>

  <p>A shiver ran down Melvin's spine.</p>

  <p>That meant the power of the punch Darcy would unleash would be equivalent to that of five horses! If the blow landed on Melvin's body, he would feel like being smashed by five horses.</p>

  <p>"You go die!" Darcy screamed.</p>

  <p>Ugly laughter followed, although his expression was fierce.</p>

  <p>Despair had Melvin's face turning pale. He was suddenly afraid that he could not bear the onslaught of power this time.</p>

  <p>But just as Darcy's fist was about to land on Melvin's body, a shiny silver object rushed towards Darcy.</p>

  <p>If he continued to punch, his arm would be cut off.</p>

  <p>Stunned by the attack that came out of the blue, Darcy pulled back his fist while gritting his teeth in anger. With a hateful expression, he turned around to withdraw the energy he was about to throw off. "Who was that? Who dared to attack me just now?" Darcy thundered.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Yan looked at Darcy coldly without speaking, as though talking to him was so disgusting.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Tristan spoke loudly to the other members of the Luo Clan. "Everybody, stop for a moment. Please get ready to follow us." Waiting to see who would follow, Miles smirked.</p>

  <p>Then with a cold smile, he turned to speak, "Tristan Luo, who do you think you are?</p>

  <p>What makes you think you can speak here, huh?"</p>

  <p>There was heavy silence.</p>

  <p>Tristan was a member of an insignificant branch of the Luo Clan. He didn't have a significant position at all. As Miles expected, he could start throwing threat that would frighten Tristan enough to make him stop.</p>

  <p>But Miles' remarks annoyed Tristan, who retorted, "You are Miles Luo, right? And who do you think you are?"</p>

  <p>It was satisfying to see the stunned look in Miles' face.</p>

  <p>"You?!" Miles blustered.</p>

  <p>Now extremely confused, Miles thought, 'Is Tristan crazy?</p>

  <p>How dare he say that?! How dare he talk back to me!</p>

  <p>He must have someone to back him up, ' Miles kept thinking.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he found several members of the Luo Clan had gathered there, following a young man and a young woman. "Are you launching a rebellion? Aren't you afraid of breaking the rules of the Clan and you'll end up either imprisoned or even becoming human punchbags?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The group laughed loudly after Miles finished talking. Then Tristan spoke out aloud, "Rebel? Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>

  <p>The new master of the Luo Clan is here. So, Miles Luo, you are the one who's rebelling!"</p>

  <p>Stunned, Miles repeated, "The new master?" He looked at Luo Zheng from head to toe, then smiling coldly, said, "Do you think you can find someone else to help you and this one can be the master?</p>

  <p>That's ridiculous!" he scoffed, then laughed. "How childish you all are!</p>

  <p>When my father comes out, all of you will have to die!" he threatened.</p>

  <p>He now sounded crazy.</p>

  <p>"Someone else?" Tristan asked before pointing to Luo Zheng. "He's not just anyone," he said with a shake of his head. "He is the new master of the Luo Clan,  Luo Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>It was with great pride that he said Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo!" Miles repeated the name without realizing he did so. The name sent a shiver up his spine. He couldn't believe his ears.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the men at the Martial Arts Hall were unaware of what was happening. Tristan's behavior had confused them. In their eyes, even if the Luo Clan was declining, they were not willing to have someone else take over the master position of the Clan.</p>

  <p>But this man wasn't just anyone. He was  Luo Zheng Luo, the son of the former master of the clan.</p>

  <p>Hearing the name, the men immediately recognized Luo Zheng. Now they understood why so many members of the clan were following the young man.</p>

  <p>"' Luo Zheng Luo?" Miles murmured incredulously.</p>

  <p>'Is he really back?' He asked the question in his mind.</p>

  <p>A smile of surprise lit up Melvin's face. 'Is that man truly Luo Zheng?' he continued to wonder.</p>

  <p>He had never stopped thinking about Luo Zheng, wondering if he was still alive.</p>

  <p>All they knew was that Luo Zheng was abducted, but no one witnessed him die, or found his dead body.</p>

  <p>Although he had selected Luo Zheng to be his punchbag long time ago, Melvin still thought highly of the former young master of the clan and was awed by his great courage.</p>

  <p>And Melvin thought it would have been a pity if that man with great courage would end up dead.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>I can't believe you came back," Melvin murmured. Suddenly, the strong man's eyes welled up with tears, and his nose started to sniffle.</p>

  <p>In view of several astonished men, Luo Zheng slowly walked up to Melvin and said, "Long time no see, Melvin. How did you end up being a human punchbag?" He looked at the older man waiting for an answer.</p>

  <p>"That's a very long story," Melvin sighed.</p>

  <p>"Then tell your story later. Let's talk about what's happening now. I saw someone wanted to beat you to death. Is that true?" Looking in the direction where Darcy stood, Luo Zheng asked Melvin, "Is that the guy?"</p>

  <p>He approached with full confidence and swung his sword.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng nearly cutting his arm, Darcy became even more furious! "Is this guy going to bring me trouble? How dare he do that! Doesn't he know who I am?</p>

  <p>He's really dancing with death!' Darcy thought bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I am the man who wants to beat him to death. What do you want to do about it?" he sneered. He asked again, "Do you know who I am?"</p>

  <p>Raising an eyebrow, he waited for acknowledgement.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng just shook his head and replied, "I really don't..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved his fingers and his sword started to quiver.</p>

  <p>"I am..."</p>

  <p>But Darcy was rudely interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>Before he could finish talking, Zheng's Streamer Sword shifted. The action was so fast like a shiny flower flitted by and slashed Darcy's neck.</p>

  <p>"I am...</p>

  <p>I am..." Darcy gasped.</p>

  <p>With his eyes opened wide, Darcy found he could no longer speak. In the dying seconds of his life, he was as confused as he was regretful.</p>

  <p>'Why didn't you let me finish what I was saying?</p>

  <p>If you knew who I am, you would certainly not dare to kill me!</p>

  <p>What a pity I'm about to die! My father will take revenge for me.' This was Darcy's last clear thought.</p>

  <p>Looking at Darcy's wide open eyes before his last breath, Luo Zheng shook his head calmly before saying, "I'm not interested to know who you are."</p>
