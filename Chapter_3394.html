  <p>
</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was still worried.</p>

  <p>She had never seen Luo Zheng stand upright in the wind before. What if he couldn't return?</p>

  <p>Luckily, she, Hutton, and Sally were able to check his soul mark and sense his position.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Luo Zheng had moved in sync with the wind.</p>

  <p>But before long, he began to fly backward against the wind.</p>

  <p>"How?" Feng Ge said, covering her mouth in astonishment as she turned to Hutton and Sally while leaning against the corner of the crater.</p>

  <p>But Hutton was as shocked as Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Even those who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm found it hard to stand firm for long in such a heavy wind, let alone to go against it.</p>

  <p>How did Luo Zheng make it?</p>

  <p>But she knew his soul mark would never lie to her. Luo Zheng was really approaching them.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Luo Zheng has already killed them. He didn't turn around until now," said Sally, chuckling and looking at her brother and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Sally and Chaim had experienced a similar event before, so she understood Feng Ge's shock pretty well.</p>

  <p>It was not long before Luo Zheng floated towards them above the crater and slowly descended into it.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyebrows rose as she took in his countenance. "What happened to those people?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I've killed them," Luo Zheng replied flatly.</p>

  <p>The hurricane had been of great help to him.</p>

  <p>And once the hurricane had come along, there had been no match for him.</p>

  <p>It had only taken Luo Zheng less than three minutes since the hurricane showed up. He had left to hunt, killed them off one by one, and returned - all of it in such a short period of time. .</p>

  <p>What was more, Adonis was as powerful as Chaim and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and Hutton looked at Luo Zheng with new respect in their eyes.</p>

  <p>They had previously thought that Luo Zheng was powerful but on the same level as Chaim and Efrain. They had regarded him to be just a little stronger than them.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng had, in such a casual, easy way, killed a talent at this level. He had matched up to those at the Chaotic Source Realm!</p>

  <p>But everyone knew that Luo Zheng hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Chaim sighed and smiled, feeling lucky that he was not Luo Zheng's enemy.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng was on the side of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. He would have been a terribly formidable enemy if he were from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race. And Chaim knew he'd meet a sticky end as Adonis did if he were to confront Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had previously fought with Luo Zheng in the Phoenix Palace but the strength that he was showing now was much greater than what he had showed then.</p>

  <p>She suspected that he had become stronger because of the Civilization Artifact he had obtained from the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>When Eastern Emperor Taiyi had later summoned Feng Ge, he had asked her to tell him everything that she had seen in the Dark Region. She had remembered everything after she had fully restored her memory.</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact had chosen Luo Zheng instead of her.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't regret any of it. She knew that if it weren't for Luo Zheng, she wouldn't have been able to leave the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Instead, she was happy to see Luo Zheng grow into a powerful warrior.</p>

  <p>They continued to inch towards the core after they crawled out of the crater.</p>

  <p>They had encountered some alien races along the way, but they had just carefully avoided them at the sight of Luo Zheng among them.</p>

  <p>Most of the creatures aimed at reaching the Chaotic Source Realm and wouldn't compete in vain. A few small races even tried to seek protection from Luo Zheng, but were rejected.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was aware that some of the small races were connected to the Bearing race or the Jin Wu. He didn't want to keep any danger like that man of the Lofty Mountain race around himself.</p>

  <p>The core of the Chaotic Source World was a ring-shaped mountain range.</p>

  <p>These brown mountains shot up into the sky like sharp swords.</p>

  <p>The highest peak was located at the center of the annular mountain range. It was over a hundred million feet high, almost reaching the top of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>"There are tens of thousands of mountains in the core area, but most of the Chaotic Source Spirits gather on the main peak and its four surrounding peaks. The main peak has the largest number of Chaotic Source Spirits," said Chaim.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood on a big rock that was as tall as two people standing, one on the other's shoulder and looked at the magnificent main peak. He said, "Then let's go straight to the main peak."</p>

  <p>"No," said Chaim, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Both Sally and Hutton looked at Chaim in confusion. Like Luo Zheng, they didn't know much about the Chaotic Source World either.</p>

  <p>"As a creature from the Other Shore, the Chaotic Source Spirit is different from other creatures from the Source World. They are independent individuals and will grow up after devouring their peers. The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits is on the main peak," Feng Ge explained.</p>

  <p>The mother was the one that had first given birth to the Chaotic Source Spirits. The longer it remained in the Source World, the stronger it would be.</p>

  <p>In the early days, someone had gone to the main peak to look for Chaotic Source Spirits. But as the mother became increasingly powerful, the main peak became more dangerous by the day.</p>

  <p>In recent decades, very few people had gone to search for the Chaotic Source Spirits on the main peak since the four peaks around it had offered much reaping and in a safer way.</p>

  <p>"But most of the Chaotic Source Spirits are on the main peak. Wouldn't it be a waste if we didn't enter it?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>All he knew was that there were only two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits in all, and that was far from enough for those who entered the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. The Chaotic Source World is so huge that it's impossible to dig out all the Chaotic Source Spirits every time. But if we kill the mother, I'm afraid some powerful warriors will have to fuse with Chaotic Source Spirits on the Other Shore, and bring them to the Source World. And that's going to be big trouble," said Chaim, wearing a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>In fact, every time the Chaotic Source World opened, only about one hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits would be swallowed. This number shrank gradually with each time.</p>

  <p>However, the fewer the Chaotic Source Spirits devoured, the faster they could be recovered, up to two hundred thousand of them. In the early days, the Chaotic Source World opened once every 15 years only because too many Chaotic Source Spirits were being devoured, and they took a long time to recover.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the towering main peak through the black smog. Since Chaim and Feng Ge had filled him in about it, he would, at least for now, not aim at it.</p>

  <p>In addition to the main peak, there were also four peaks in four directions around it. They walked west, encountering the easternmost peak first.</p>

  <p>"Okay! Our goal is the eastern peak!" said Sally, stretching out an arm and pointing at the destination.</p>

  <p>She and Hutton were confident enough to step into the Chaotic Source Realm. After all, they had Luo Zheng with them.</p>

  <p>People smiled and nodded before heading for the eastern peak.</p>

  <p>They chose to take a radian route, walking northward before going west.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had noticed that Dorothy was moving at the beginning, but was later fixed in the northwest after having remained unmoving for several hours.</p>

  <p>She should have been hiding and waiting for him. Luo Zheng appreciated her smart move. He wasn't about to leave her behind and enter the core area alone.</p>

  <p>But the situation was shades different from what Luo Zheng had imagined.</p>
