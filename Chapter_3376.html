<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Earlier, Zheng had smashed around thirty rocks but only found one Chaotic Source Spirit among them.</p>

  <p>There were probably thousands of rocks piled up there. Zheng smashed them one by one, almost razing the area to the ground.</p>

  <p>And yet, he couldn't find another Chaotic Source Spirit...</p>

  <p>Surveying the multitudes of broken stones on the ground, Zheng sighed helplessly.</p>

  <p>Two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits were scattered within an area with the diameter of millions of miles, most of which lived in groups. It was not easy to find one that appeared alone.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng refused to give up. The Chaotic Source World would stay open for one month; he still had time.</p>

  <p>If it was difficult for him to find Chaotic Source Spirits, how much more for the others?</p>

  <p>Zheng took a break from smashing stones to check on the soul marks.</p>

  <p>The hurricanes kept on pushing everyone further away from each other.</p>

  <p>The distance between him and Feng Ge wasn't any closer than before. In fact, it seemed she had drifted even farther. The same went for Dorothy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, to Zheng's relief, he noted that the six people of the Nine Li race were much closer to him. Hutton and the three other Nine Li people were gathered as a group, while Sally was dozens of miles to his left.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng grunted, as he pondered over this.</p>

  <p>Sally had left a soul mark on him, as well. If she sensed his existence, she should have definitely headed in his direction.</p>

  <p>But now, Sally stayed put, wherever she was.</p>

  <p>The hurricane would blow every five minutes, and it was coming again soon. God knew where Zheng would be blown to next.</p>

  <p>So, he wasted no time and headed to the left, to where Sally was. Soon, he encountered a mountain range -- or what was left of it.</p>

  <p>Apparently, someone had also destroyed the mountains. They were almost completely leveled, with shards of shattered rocks everywhere.</p>

  <p>"There are still three miles left..."</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng checked on Sally's location. After confirming she hadn't moved, he leapt into the air and flew through the flattened mountain range.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the area where Sally was supposed to be, he found no one there.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Zheng surveyed the area with vigilance. The soul mark couldn't lie, but he couldn't see Sally anywhere.</p>

  <p>"She must be down there..."</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility: Sally was within the mountains. There must have been an entrance somewhere.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was deep in thought, the black smog above his head surged once more.</p>

  <p>After having gone through this several times, Zheng knew what to expect.</p>

  <p>As soon as the black smog started to surge, this indicated the hurricane would blow within a few seconds.</p>

  <p>He cursed under his breath.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult for Zheng to escape the hurricane now, but it would be really inconvenient once he was blown away.</p>

  <p>Just then, a voice suddenly chirped not far from him. "Zheng! In here! Come on in!"</p>

  <p>Zheng turned his gaze to the direction where the sound came from. Suddenly, he saw Sally's fair arm waving frantically at him from a crack at the side of a mountain.</p>

  <p>The upper and lower parts of the crack were folded, so it would have been difficult to detect it without using spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Zheng knitted his brows. Planting his feet firmly on one side of the mountain, he launched himself towards the crack with incredible force, shooting towards Sally's waving arm.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As he was closing in on the small cave, the hurricane started to surge.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, hurry u--"</p>

  <p>But before she could even finish her sentence, the hurricane blew with such force that she was pushed violently into the depths of the stone crack.</p>

  <p>Zheng also felt the incredible force of the hurricane tugging at his body.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, he knew he had to do something quick.</p>

  <p>Zheng lowered himself, rolling over and then kicked a giant rock that was beside him.</p>

  <p>The kick was an explosive force of over a thousand divine megatons, completely shattering the rock in an instant.</p>

  <p>Zheng used this momentum to launch himself forward a bit. It was just enough for his fingers to clasp desperately onto the edge of the crack.</p>

  <p>Channeling all his strength into his arm, he pulled himself inside the crack.</p>

  <p>Like Sally, the hurricane whipped him from behind so violently, he was pushed into the depths of the crack.</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled blindly in the dark until he crashed into a stone wall. When he got his bearings, he realized he was in a small cave.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was naturally able to withstand the collision. He stood up, unscathed. Instead, the wall of the cave had some hairline cracks from the impact.</p>

  <p>Just now, Sally had also been thrown down by the hurricane. Like Zheng, she also collided with the wall of the cave, but she wasn't as strong as Zheng. She was knocked out, lying motionless on the ground, unconscious.</p>

  <p>Zheng slid down from the cave wall, and held up Sally. He stretched out two fingers and pressed them against her forehead to check her condition. After a while, he was a little relieved knowing that her injuries weren't serious.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately... She's just passed out." As he spoke, he gently released a stream of warm soul force onto her body.</p>

  <p>After a while, her eyelashes fluttered as she woke up. To Zheng's surprise, the first thing she said was, "Zheng, are you alright?"</p>

  <p>"You should worry about yourself!" Zheng smiled, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine!" She sat up and stretched her arms and legs.</p>

  <p>After all, Sally was a descendant of Chiyou's brother. Although the bodies of people of the Nine Li race were considered weak compared to that of nonhuman creatures, they were still the strongest among the many human forces.</p>

  <p>"Why are you in a cave?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Sally blinked. "I was searching for the Chaotic Source Spirits with them down there. Just now, I found that your soul mark was approaching, so I came up. I didn't expect that the hurricane would come at this time..."</p>

  <p>If Sally hadn't spotted Zheng and warned him in time, he would have been blown ten thousand miles away by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>"Is there a Chaotic Source Spirit in the cave?" Zheng's eyes flashed. "And who are the people you're talking about?"</p>

  <p>"There are not only Chaotic Source Spirits, but also many vicious beasts!</p>

  <p>Zheng, just follow me and you'll find out," Sally answered cryptically.</p>

  <p>She led the way in the front, and they went down the rugged path in the cave. After a while, they took a sharp turn and Zheng found that there was a different world underground. Underneath the flattened mountains, there was actually a huge cave, with shimmering stone walls.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the cave, there was a thick stone pillar with countless small holes on its surface. Fiery red eyes flickered from inside the holes.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!" A voice cried as soon as they entered the cave.</p>

  <p>"Chaim!" Zheng grinned widely.</p>

  <p>Chaim was on par with Milo in terms of both status and strength in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he was very smart and flexible, which had left a deep impression on Zheng on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Besides Chaim, there were other warriors present: two werewolves of the Celestial Wolf race, three members of the Moon Spirit race, and another nonhuman creature.</p>

  <p>If they were members of the super forces, they would never have been able to tolerate each other, and would have probably already taken action against each other. However, since they were all from smaller races, they were able to get along quite harmoniously.</p>

  <p>With Zheng there, Chaim was filled with joy. "Zheng, you came at the right time.</p>

  <p>This stone pillar is so dangerous. We don't know how to deal with it. I was wondering if you can break the pillar."</p>

  <p>Zheng, of course, knew that since they stayed in this cave, these warriors had to be up to something.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the stone pillar. "Are there Chaotic Source Spirits in the pillar?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and actually, there are a lot of them," answered Chaim with certainty.</p>

  <p>"But besides the Chaotic Source Spirits, there are also other ferocious beasts inside, which are very troublesome to deal with."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he summoned a fishing rod, casting the line. Then the hook with the bait flew towards the pillar.</p>
