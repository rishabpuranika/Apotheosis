<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was never such a thing as fair in the world.</p>

  <p>Every creature had its unique form and its advantages in a specific environment. For example, a fish could swim freely in water, but it would die on land.</p>

  <p>Now, it was clear that humans didn't have any advantages with their forms in the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>This was evident when Zheng had no choice but to move awkwardly like a crab.</p>

  <p>From the outside, the Eternal Scroll Painting looked like a single piece of paper, but in fact, it was three pages.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, all the pages weren't as blank as they seemed. In reality, there were many beasts inside them.</p>

  <p>There were many speculations about the origin of the beasts in the scroll painting. Some people said that the beasts in the scroll painting were creatures from the Abstruse Energy World, but the Eternal Scroll Painting turned out to be more habitable for them. Others said that the Instant Civilization created the beasts in the scroll painting.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they were all simply assumptions.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Zheng encountered a beast after he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>The beast looked similar to the silhouette of an Other Shore creature. It wasn't that big, and it looked like a small wolf that was no taller than a human's leg.</p>

  <p>The second he saw the beast, it quickly pounced on him.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures and Zheng could only do limited things within the Eternal Scroll Painting. It truly felt like they were embedded in a painting, as their movements were restricted. On the other hand, the beasts in the scroll painting had more freedom.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng chose to counterattack directly.</p>

  <p>However, the whole battle was simpler and more boring than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately swung down the second the beast approached him.</p>

  <p>Although the movement felt awkward, he was still able to grab its leg accurately. At the same time, he twisted his other hand and tore the leg in half.</p>

  <p>The whole process went by quietly as if a peaceful scene silently played out before his eyes.</p>

  <p>The mangled beast turned into wisps of black smoke and swiftly gathered towards his body, then completely fused with him.</p>

  <p>When all of the smoke had merged with him, his whole body trembled violently.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a wisp of black smoke flew out of the Eternal Scroll Painting and fell from the sky, then headed straight towards his Three Purities Stone.</p>

  <p>After that, a black mark appeared on the intricate pattern on the stone's surface. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, how many beasts do I need to kill before I can go to the second page?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>There was an important condition that one had to fulfill before they could go to the second page, and that was to absorb enough beasts in the scroll painting.</p>

  <p>"I can't say exactly," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. "The beasts on the first page aren't too powerful, and the black smoke you can absorb from them isn't much. If you only kill beasts of that size, then you need to kill about four thousand to five thousand of them," he explained.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, there were only a limited number of beasts every time the Eternal Scroll Painting opened.</p>

  <p>Therefore, those Other Shore creatures were in a hurry because they wanted to kill enough beasts in the shortest time possible.</p>

  <p>"Four to five thousand... That's a lot," he sighed.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but feel a little helpless.</p>

  <p>It wasn't hard to kill the beasts in the scroll painting, but the problem was that there seemed to be very few of them.</p>

  <p>Those who didn't kill enough beasts in the scroll painting couldn't advance to the second page. Furthermore, when the Eternal Scroll Painting closed, those who couldn't enter the second page would naturally be expelled, which meant they had failed.</p>

  <p>Yet, the price of failure in the Eternal Scroll Painting wasn't too heavy. The "Heavy Stone" would simply be destroyed afterward.</p>

  <p>Besides, if even the Oneness Sky Palace wouldn't have a hard time obtaining a few Heavy Stones, then the Other Shore races could get more.</p>

  <p>That was why all the Other Shore creatures that had obtained the Holy Souls and the Myriad Tribulations Bodies successfully entered the Eternal Scroll Painting. As a result, the competition in the Eternal Scroll Painting became more intense.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Eternal Scroll Painting was not a safe place. Many people died inside it every time it opened.</p>

  <p>Some of them died because the beasts in the scroll painting had killed them, but most of them died in each other's hands.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had killed the beast, he traversed through the Eternal Scroll Painting like a crab once more.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't even tell his position because of his limited vision. He just moved in one direction.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had been having bad luck. He only encountered a few beasts along the way, and most of them were quite thin and small.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he didn't let go of any of them.</p>

  <p>Overall, he only came across eight beasts in more than two hours. One of them was a snake-shaped beast, which had even escaped. He chased it for a long time but eventually had to give up in the end.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, many Other Shore creatures on the bronze ground observed the Three Purities Stones on the ground.</p>

  <p>When the Eternal Scroll Painting had opened, it showed the silhouettes of the masters at the Eternal Realm. That was the scene on the third page.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng and the others were still on the first page, their movements naturally couldn't be observed.</p>

  <p>Every time the creatures from the Other Shore killed a beast in the scroll painting, however, a black streak of ink dropped from the scroll painting and left a mark on the Three Purities Stone.</p>

  <p>Every time the bronze ground was refreshed, one could see the progress of the warriors in the Eternal Scroll Painting through observing the Three Purities Stones.</p>

  <p>Most of the Other Shore races only cared about their own warriors' Three Purities Stones. This time, however, a lot of the Other Shore creatures were focused on Zheng's Three Purities Stone, whether intentionally or unintentionally. It didn't matter if it were the Other Shore races that surrendered to the Element Spirit race or races that were neutral like the Three Eyes race; all of them quietly observed Zheng.</p>

  <p>Usually, anyone who caught the attention of Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven supposedly performed well in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and it shouldn't be hard for them to reach the Eternal Realm on their first attempt.</p>

  <p>However, more than two hours had passed, but there were only very few marks of ink on Zheng's Three Purities Stone!</p>

  <p>"That human guy doesn't seem to have any extraordinary abilities."</p>

  <p>"Over two hours have passed, but he has only killed a few beasts in the scroll painting?"</p>

  <p>"If he continues like that, he'll soon be eliminated…"</p>

  <p>Some creatures chattered among themselves in low voices, but Pearce, Auden, and the others from the Oneness Sky Palace still heard them.</p>

  <p>"What is Zheng doing?" Pearce asked. Auden shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Maybe luck is not on his side today. I heard that the beasts in the scroll painting appear at random," he said.</p>

  <p>All the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace who were present were at the Holy Soul Realm, so they couldn't enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and had no idea what might have happened inside.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>Just then, wisps of black smoke emerged continuously from the Eternal Scroll Painting and quickly descended towards their direction.</p>

  <p>Pearce and the others immediately perked up when they saw the streaks of ink. 'Have they finally come?' they asked in their hearts.</p>

  <p>A smile graced Auden's face as well. He knew Zheng would never let them down.</p>

  <p>But as the streaks of ink continued to fall, they went towards a Three Purities Stone nearby, which belonged to Walden of the Violet Cloud race.</p>

  <p>The members of the Violet Cloud race knew what the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were thinking, and they felt disdain because of it. One of them even sneered, "I was wondering what kind of extraordinary being he was, but he's a loser after all. Now he wants to challenge our Violet Cloud race? Could he even enter the second page? Even if he did, he would only end up dead!"</p>
