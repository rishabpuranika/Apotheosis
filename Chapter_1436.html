<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The leader shook his head. "Every year, there are some overconfident warriors who enter the underground place, thinking that they can open it and find some treasures."</p>

  <p>"But, Saint Lord, the activation of this underground palace doesn't have any fixed pattern. Maybe they can succeed in opening it this time," the black-robed warrior said.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Magnolia Sacred Place smiled and said, "It doesn't matter. I've already set up a monitoring array in the underground palace.</p>

  <p>If the underground palace is opened, I'll receive the news immediately. If they really succeed in opening it, it would be the best news for us, and I can then send our disciples there."</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the others had been walking in the passage leading to the underground palace, all three biggest sacred places in the Dark World had somehow received the news.</p>

  <p>These sacred places had only paid attention to the movements of Zheng and his companions. Other than that, they didn't do anything.</p>

  <p>Every once in a while, warriors would seek to enter the underground palace for a variety of reasons. But the last time that the underground palace had opened was over a hundred thousand years ago. It had never been successfully reopened since then.</p>

  <p>However, this did not mean that the three sacred places did not value this underground palace. It was a place of strategic importance and whichever warriors did make it into the palace would gain the upper hand in the current status quo among the three races.</p>

  <p>This was, after all, the resting place of a Supreme Lord from remote ages. Although the underground palace had been opened so many times before, no one had managed to take out the most important secret treasures. The entire Dark World was still relatively barren compared to the other supreme worlds. If there was a chance to enter the underground palace again, how could the sacred places possibly let it go? This was a rare opportunity for the warriors who were all questing to their own personal betterment.</p>

  <p>Therefore, every sacred place had secretly set up networks of spies, and had placed them at the entrance of the underground palace or perhaps even in the passage. And every time creatures had entered the hidden depths of the underground palace, these spies would closely observe them. Besides the three tenth-grade sacred places, there were also many seventh-grade and eighth-grade sacred places, and many sects that secretly observed everything that was happening in the entrance and passage of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>It could be said that when Lincoln led Zheng and the rest down the passage, their movements had already been observed by the many forces of the Dark World. If they really succeeded in opening the Dark Underground Palace, these forces would soon take actions.</p>

  <p>"How long is this damn tunnel?" someone complained in frustration.</p>

  <p>The person who had complained was called Coy Hou. The names of the seven brothers were very distinctive. The eldest was called Ab Hou, and the other six brothers were Baal Hou, Coy Hou... The youngest one was named Gil Hou. The first letters of their given names were A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Thus it was easy to remember their names. With their names, they could even easily figure out who was elder and who was younger among them.</p>

  <p>"You should be a bit more patient, Coy. It is said that this underground palace is truly huge. Besides, it's only been four hours, and you can't take it anymore?" Ab Hou said indifferently and sneered.</p>

  <p>"There must be a limit or end to this, no matter how long the passage is.</p>

  <p>We have already travelled hundreds of thousands of miles. When will this be the end?" Coy Hou continued to complain bitterly after his brother teased him.</p>

  <p>Actually, not only Coy Hou, but the others were all muttering in their minds. Even flying at their current top speed, they could still not see the end of the passage. Indeed, they had never seen such a long passage before. It seemed to continue indefinitely.</p>

  <p>"I heard that this underground palace was built by a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Therefore, crossing through a supreme world would be quite normal here. This unit of length then is normal and acceptable. I'm just afraid that if we keep flying down there, we won't be able to reach the end in two or three months," Baal Hou said and shook his head, not wanting to seem weak before his peers.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Adrian, who was following after them, suddenly pointed ahead and said, "It seems like we have finally reached the end."</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes immediately lit up as they looked towards the front.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, there was no other way forward. Ahead of them was a solid wall. It seemed that they had indeed reached the end of the passage. But then, their faces were filled with disappointment. Stepping closer, they found that this was only a turn in the passage. After turning this corner, there was still an endless passage stretching ahead of them.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Ab Hou said helplessly. His brothers had become more and more impatient.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Lincoln said, "Wait."</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes focused on Lincoln. Ab Hou asked impatiently, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>Lincoln couldn't be bothered to answer these brutish warriors. These seven brothers were only able to follow him into the underground palace because of Adrian. Completely ignoring them, Lincoln took out a divine texture from his space ring and pasted it onto the wall of the passage.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Lincoln concentrated and poured his life vitality into the divine texture. A faintly green light began to spread out, shining onto the wall in front of them.</p>

  <p>With a grating sound of stone on stone, the wall slid to the side in a shower of dust and cobwebs. As the wall on the side of the passage opened up, another passage appeared before them.</p>
