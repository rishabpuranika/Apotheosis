<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2777 Meet Your Death </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the furnace on the side of the hall, the blazing flames shrunk and were extinguished quickly. Even the ashes turned cold, leaving no trace of the warmth that once filled the hall.</p>

  <p>Everyone stayed still, as if they were stuck in their positions. Some of the fiend servants hiding behind the fiends started trembling in fear.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the place had been transformed, Stuart, Azazel and the other fiends looked sullen.</p>

  <p>It was a familiar voice that they heard earlier.</p>

  <p>It was the same voice that was hidden in the Sea of Meditation, taught the fiends to cultivate and made the fiend race develop to be powerful. Who would ever forget?</p>

  <p>Under its guidance, the fiends learned how to control their emotions and completely take the seven emotions out of their bodies, turning them into the seven little fiends.</p>

  <p>If not for this voice, the fiend race would not be able to make it this far.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, the powerful fiends were able to stay in the Sea of Meditation to cultivate.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you in the Sea of Meditation? How are you able to come out?"</p>

  <p>Stuart asked, clearly surprised to see their visitor.</p>

  <p>The cold female voice replied, "When did I ever say that I can't leave the Sea of Meditation?"</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack.</p>

  <p>The sound filled the room as the ice on the smooth table grew thicker and thicker.</p>

  <p>The fine ice crystals continuously gathered at the center of the table, rapidly growing like a plant.</p>

  <p>Layer by layer, it grew until the ice crystals were about the same height as a person. Then, they transformed into a shape of a very attractive human figure.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a beam of milky white light flashing, everyone was blinded for a while. As soon as the light started fading, the perfect body wrapped in a light blue cloak appeared before them.</p>

  <p>Everyone was left speechless. The big fiends stared firmly at this body, including Gallio.</p>

  <p>They initially thought she was like those unknown creatures who didn't have a body, and even could not prove their existence.</p>

  <p>But today, her real body appeared right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>The fiends yearned for the human civilization. They appreciated humans, so they imprisoned the female disciples of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Coming from powerful clans, all those female disciples were originally gorgeous with unique temperament, and extremely outstanding in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>However, compared with this frosty, captivating body, they seemed very ordinary.</p>

  <p>"Da!"</p>

  <p>As the woman took a light step forward on the table, her white and tender toe tips gently touched the table, causing a huge hexagonal ice crystal to spread out from her foot. She then floated with her feet on the ice crystal.</p>

  <p>"Who wanted to go back on their words just now?"</p>

  <p>Floating in the air, she glanced at the several big fiends who stared back at her.</p>

  <p>"Those guys and Stuart wanted to do that!"</p>

  <p>Gallio jumped out and accused, not missing a beat.</p>

  <p>Since these guys had betrayed him, Gallio would never care about their safety anymore even if they were all from the same race.</p>

  <p>"I...I..."</p>

  <p>Looking at the woman above the table, Stuart was a little flustered, but even under panic, he was able to secretly give a hint to those little fiends.</p>

  <p>The woman was as small as an ant in comparison to Stuart's size, but he felt naturally nervous while facing her. He felt her eyes darted on him after Gallio had accused him of betrayal.</p>

  <p>Before the woman could open her mouth to say something, a little fiend attached to the wall suddenly stepped on the round table. In a blink of an eye, he jumped on the edge of the round table again and rushed in front of the woman.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" the little fiend shouted with an evil smile.</p>

  <p>Given his speed, no one was able to react!</p>

  <p>However, as the little fiend approached the woman, it appeared that his movement started to get slower.</p>

  <p>With every step he took, his speed was involuntarily cut down in half. By the time he was only twenty feet away from the woman, he floated in the air and moved at an extremely slow pace.</p>

  <p>Looking at the ugly little fiend, the woman couldn't help showing a trace of disgust and contempt on her extremely beautiful face. She commented indifferently, "If the temperature is lowered to the extreme, all the movements will slow down. Since you don't want to stay outside, I guess you can go back now!"</p>

  <p>She then stretched out a white finger and gently touched the little fiend's body.</p>

  <p>Still floating in the air, the little fiend stopped moving. His small body began to expand rapidly to ten times its original size.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>With a sound of explosion, the little fiend immediately turned into beams of brown light, penetrating into the bodies of the other fiends present.</p>

  <p>In a few moments, more rays of brown light rushed out of the Fiend Hall and penetrated into the bodies of the other fiends.</p>

  <p>As soon as it was over, the woman cast a quick glance at the remaining six little fiends. They all restrained themselves and shivered together.</p>

  <p>The rest of the little fiends knew that the little fiend called 'Pride' had truly died. This emotion was finally returned to the fiend race!</p>

  <p>"At that time, I helped you release these emotions in order to make your fiend race grow stronger and end the chaos in the Abyss Demon Region," the woman said indifferently. "It seems that I did the right thing. You've led the entire Abyss Demon Region and led a very good life."</p>

  <p>Staring back at Stuart, she continued, "It's a pity how you've forgotten that you're only the combination of the Faith Energy. None of you are real. To put it simply, you're just a group of illusory creatures!"</p>

  <p>Although these fiends were powerful, they had never really come to this world. The traces they had left, their strength, and everything about them were just products of imagination.</p>

  <p>"That's right. How can we be willing to stay in the Abyss Demon Region?" echoed Gallio.</p>

  <p>"What if we are willing to be such illusory creatures?" asked Stuart, looking at the woman with a complicated expression.</p>

  <p>A contemptuous smile appeared on the woman's cold face. She uttered,</p>

  <p>"The fierce beasts in the entire Abyss Demon Region have poured into the sixth stage and they are all going to be reborn. With that being said, they will be cutting off the Faith Energy in their own bodies at the same time. Do you think that you still have a choice?"</p>

  <p>Stuart, Azazel and the other big fiends were all shocked with this news.</p>

  <p>This woman had always guided them, but they thought that her guidance could only be confined within the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>They did not expect that this woman would be so powerful to control the fierce beasts of the entire Abyss Demon Region. Even the fiends couldn't do that. They could only subdue those intelligent vicious beasts but not control them.</p>

  <p>"I will fulfill my promise. If I succeed, I will let you get out of the control of the Abyss Demon Region," the woman said calmly. Her eyes scanned the room for any violent reaction. "Now, should I kill you or should you go and meet your death before those Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>While they were hearing her limited options, the expressions on Stuart's and the other big fiends' faces immediately turned bitter.</p>

  <p>Considering their sizes, these three big fiends were not unable to fight this woman.</p>

  <p>It was just that they did not even have the courage to resist her head-on!</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, Stuart. It is our original plan, isn't it?" Gallio finally spoke, beaming a gloating smile.</p>
