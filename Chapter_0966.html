  <p>
</p>

  <p>Not long after, several streaks of light shot out from within the Xi Clan's castle, immediately attracting the attention of many warriors who were there to woo Margaret.</p>

  <p>One of the streaks of light zoomed directly into the square. A boy shouted, "Zheng!"</p>

  <p>The boy was none other than Brent.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, he had missed the opportunity to challenge Zheng due to a sudden change during the Martial Arts Contest. He had always regretted it.</p>

  <p>In the past two years, Brent's cultivation level had increased a lot, but Zheng had disappeared without a trace, and rumors about his death were rife. How could Brent not be excited upon Zheng's arrival? He rushed out immediately, albeit a bit perturbed, because he also suspected that someone was pretending to be Zheng.</p>

  <p>But to his intense surprise, the man was Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng, too, was surprised to see Brent. He knew that Brent was a divine-level talent of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, but he did not know that he belonged to the Xi Clan.</p>

  <p>"Hi Brent, it's been a long time. How have you been?" Zheng greeted him blandly without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"You have also stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm! Let's have a fight, shall we?" Brent wasted no time in challenging Zheng. He didn't even bother about the fact that this was a special occasion.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Zheng wouldn't agree. He hadn't come here to challenge Brent, but for the daughter of the Xi Clan.</p>

  <p>"Brent, stop messing around!" A middle-aged man followed closely behind Brent. Some keen observers had already recognized him. It was Robin Xi, the head of the Xi Clan.</p>

  <p>Robin Xi cupped his hands in greeting to Zheng, and said, "I heard that you arrived at the Xi Clan, and I am greatly honored. This is not the place to talk. Come in, please!"</p>

  <p>Zheng also cupped his hands and bowed down to Robin Xi. Then he followed the warriors of the Xi Clan into the castle.</p>

  <p>On his way in, Robin Xi wondered why Zheng was suddenly visiting them.</p>

  <p>Zheng had disappeared for two years and no one knew where he had gone.</p>

  <p>He was not related to the Xi Clan, so he wasn't here visiting his family. It was safe to assume that he was here for Margaret, who had the Purple Power Body. Robin Xi had been worried about her for quite a while, and now Zheng had arrived at the right time.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat down in the main hall of the castle and exchanged pleasantries with the people of the Xi Clan. Warriors were unlike scholars and did not have any formalities. Robin Xi got straight to the point. "Zheng, may I know if you are here for my daughter, Margaret?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, and asked, "Yes. I heard that she also has the Purple Power Body. I would like to know where she is now."</p>

  <p>Robin Xi clapped his hands to summon a servant beside him. "Quick! Go and find Margaret," he ordered.</p>

  <p>He then sighed and added, "It's my fault for spoiling her too much. Since you have come here for her, you must have known our current crisis.</p>

  <p>Could you please help us out? I really don't know what to do."</p>

  <p>Robin Xi wanted to hear what Zheng had to say. He knew that Zheng must have seen the long line outside, and his words were a clear hint— he wanted Zheng to marry his daughter.</p>

  <p>Brent remained silent, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. If Zheng became his brother-in-law, he would have more chances in the future to challenge him. Sooner or later, he would be able to fight against Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng clearly understood what Robin Xi was trying to say.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't marry Margaret just because of a crisis, right? More importantly, he didn't think she was willing to marry him.</p>

  <p>Zheng said, "Miss Xi has the Purple Power Body, so it's not safe for her to stay in the Ethereal City. I want to bring her to the Cloud Hall to protect her. Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array should be able to stop Eddie for a while."</p>

  <p>Robin Xi was very disappointed at Zheng's words. Brent was the adopted son of the Xi Clan, and he always talked about Zheng. So Zheng was not a stranger to the Xi Clan. It was said that Zheng was more talented than Brent. If Robin Xi could make Zheng his son-in-law, then it would be very beneficial for Xi Clan.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had made it clear that he was not going to marry his daughter. Robin Xi thought that Zheng might change his mind once he saw his daughter. If Zheng agreed, Robin Xi would force her to marry him irrespective of how she felt. A look of determination slowly appeared on Robin Xi's face. This could not be delayed any longer.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, if you can persuade my daughter to follow you to the Cloud Hall, then the matter can be solved easily. But as long as she is unmarried, Eddie won't stop trying to take her away. We must think of a way to settle this once and for all," Robin Xi said.</p>

  <p>Xun suddenly giggled inside and said via the life vitality, "This old man only wants to marry his daughter off to you. I reckon that woman is as ugly as a pig. That's why the old man is so eager to do it!"</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't be bothered with what Xun said and simply nodded at Robin Xi. Just then, two maids opened the door, and the scent of a young lady blew in. A young girl in plain clothes walked in. She was Margaret Xi.</p>

  <p>"Margaret, come over here and meet our guest," said Robin Xi eagerly.</p>

  <p>That servant had told Margaret that her father wanted to see her. She didn't know there was a stranger here. She thought this man was from some large clan and her father wanted to marry her off to him. She had always been against marrying someone she didn't know. As a result, she had a long face.</p>

  <p>Hearing her father's words, Margaret quickly walked over, her elegant face as cold as ice. She cast a scornful look at Zheng. "Let me be straight with you. You don't have the qualifications to marry me. Just go back home," she said rudely.</p>

  <p>Brent's heart sank at his sister's words. He peeked at Robin Xi and immediately knew it was going to be bad.</p>

  <p>As Brent expected, Robin Xi's face darkened like a piece of charcoal. He suddenly stood up, took a few steps towards her, and said angrily,</p>

  <p>"Margaret, you are too presumptuous! Don't think that just because your great-grandfather dotes on you, you will be able to mess around as you like!"</p>

  <p>The great-grandfather Robin Xi was talking about was none other than Xander.</p>

  <p>Xander doted on Margaret very much, and that was why Robin Xi, Margaret's father, didn't dare to discipline her. He never thought that his daughter would grow up to be such a stubborn girl. He was really hoping that Zheng would fall for his daughter at first sight! But now that seemed impossible thanks to her brash behavior. In fact, Zheng might even despise her now. How could Robin Xi not get angry?</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't show any anger on his face when being treated so badly for no fault of his. What was more, he hadn't come to ask her hand in marriage.</p>

  <p>"I'm presumptuous? Dad, how can you say that? I'd rather die!" She turned her chin up resolutely. She was rather defiant.</p>

  <p>Robin Xi raised his hand. He was about to slap her, but Margaret was obstinate, and she had no intention of dodging it. However, Zheng stepped between them and stopped Robin Xi. He said, "Master Xi, please calm down. I have something to say to Miss Xi."</p>

  <p>Robin Xi couldn't lose his temper in front of an outsider. He had no choice but to suppress the anger in his heart.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the girl in front of him and said, "Miss Xi, you've misunderstood. I'm not here to woo you."</p>

  <p>She scowled at him. "I know. You're only here to get to know me. At the same time, you want to show me your strength and eloquence, and tell me which clan you belong to and what immeasurable potential you have.</p>

  <p>Come on! Just admit it. You are here with the same purpose as the guys outside. A person like you can only be described in one word— hypocrite. You are even more disgusting than those who are standing outside," she said mockingly.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Brent could not stop himself from laughing upon hearing this.</p>

  <p>"Brent! What are you laughing at? What's so funny?" an annoyed Margaret berated him.</p>

  <p>Zheng was speechless. He hadn't thought that this quiet and refined young lady would be so bold and energetic. Moreover, she had a wild imagination.</p>

  <p>Now Zheng said seriously, "I'm not trying to get to know you. You have the Purple Power Body, so it's too dangerous for you to stay here. I have come to take you away from the Ethereal City."</p>

  <p>"Take me away? Just you?" she asked warily.</p>

  <p>"Leave with me, or die right now. It's your choice." Although Zheng's tone was unusually calm, what he said was the cold, hard truth.</p>
