<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1132 Dragon Arsenic </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>An arrow was usually a symbol of speed. They were projectile weapons designed to be as fast as lightning, but the arrows coming towards them were the exact opposite.</p>

  <p>"These arrows seem to be bound by the Time Law. That's why they're so slow!" Camilla observed.</p>

  <p>Renzo couldn't help but laugh when he saw the oncoming arrows.</p>

  <p>"They're even slower than half of my walking speed. How could they ever hit anyone?"</p>

  <p>But Randy was quick to dismiss his humor. "Don't underestimate these arrows. They contain Dragon Arsenic. It's a type of poison that can kill even a Soul Sea Realm warrior. Many Life and Death Realm warriors have died because of these arrows."</p>

  <p>Renzo scoffed, not really believing what Randy had said. "The poison on these arrows may be powerful, but you can't expect me to believe that a Life and Death Realm warrior has died because of the arrows.</p>

  <p>They're so slow that even an old man could easily dodge them. How can they ever kill a Life and Death Realm warrior?"</p>

  <p>Randy shook his head at Renzo's dismissal. "These arrows are all defensive measures left behind by the Dragon Lineage Human. I'm just telling you this because it's better to be safe than sorry. You'll see soon enough why we should be on guard."</p>

  <p>The seriousness in Randy's voice clearly emphasized the danger of these arrows. Renzo was still skeptical but chose to remain cautious. It was indeed better to be safe than sorry.</p>

  <p>The five of them continued on towards the forest with Randy taking the lead.</p>

  <p>There weren't a lot of arrows at first, so they could easily ignore them while they went on their way.</p>

  <p>The arrows came from the front and everyone just needed to carefully dodge them. It wasn't hard considering that the arrows were incredibly slow.</p>

  <p>However, they soon realized the truth in Randy's words when he told them they had to be careful. It wasn't the speed they should've been concerned with, but the rapid increase in volume of the arrows the further they ventured inside the forest.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, three to five arrows flew towards them, which were easily avoidable.</p>

  <p>However, that number quickly bumped up to twenty, and the arrows now came from all directions.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the arrows would line up in a row and completely seal off a path ahead, which meant everyone would have to fly over or crawl their way through the obstacle.</p>

  <p>It wasn't extremely back-breaking, but the suppression from the blood sacrifice did make it quite difficult for them to fly. It was good that they were skilled Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors and could still keep their movements agile.</p>

  <p>However, Renzo couldn't help but grow impatient at these arrows.</p>

  <p>An oncoming arrow approached him and effectively blocked his way.</p>

  <p>Thinking nothing of it, Renzo got out his dagger and swung at the projectile.</p>

  <p>"Renzo! Don't!"</p>

  <p>Randy shouted, but it was already too late.</p>

  <p>The dagger was a mid-grade sacred weapon, so it was no doubt sharp.</p>

  <p>However, the blade failed to even cut through the arrow. In fact, as it came slashing down, the arrow merely trembled before speeding up towards Renzo.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>It was as if a switch had been flipped as the arrow suddenly took off and headed for Renzo's chest.</p>

  <p>The sudden acceleration stunned Renzo and left him frozen in his spot.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, Luo Zheng was quick enough to push him away at such a critical moment. The arrow missed him by mere millimeters and simply grazed the front of his chest, leaving a large hole on his shirt.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up and help him take off his clothes!"</p>

  <p>Randy shouted with urgency.</p>

  <p>A streak of blue light appeared where the arrow had grazed Renzo's shirt.</p>

  <p>It was the deadly Dragon Arsenic that Randy had warned all of them about!</p>

  <p>An ordinary poison would only take effect once it had entered the victim's body, but the Dragon Arsenic was different. It was similar to a living creature that ate through anything in order to eliminate its victim; in this case, it was eating through Renzo's shirt.</p>

  <p>Renzo immediately panicked and made a frantic move to take off his clothes. His distress stemmed from Randy's words earlier that the poison had claimed the lives of Life and Death Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was more direct. Understanding the urgency of the situation, he used his palm strike and directly shattered Renzo's clothes.</p>

  <p>Randy heaved a sigh of relief once the clothes dissipated through the wind, taking the ominous blue light with it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Renzo was in a slightly dazed state having just survived a near-death experience.</p>

  <p>Randy quickly took out a set of clothes from his space ring and tossed them at Renzo. "Put these on! If it weren't for Luo Zheng, you'd already be dead!"</p>

  <p>Both Camilla and Barry also breathed a sigh of relief. It was at this moment that they really counted themselves lucky for teaming up with someone as capable as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Don't be careless anymore. The deeper we go, the more arrows we'll see. They may be slow but it will still be very difficult to dodge them!"</p>

  <p>Randy warned once again.</p>

  <p>Camilla, Barry, and Renzo all subconsciously stayed close to Luo Zheng, feeling a sense of security in his presence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed this but did not mind. His body was immune to most poisons and the only scary thing about these arrows was the Dragon Arsenic on them. In terms of power, it wouldn't really cause much harm to Luo Zheng. He could protect his teammates if trouble ever arose.</p>

  <p>"Another row of arrows is coming! Everyone, follow me!"</p>

  <p>Randy ordered.</p>

  <p>The deeper they went, the more arrows there would be. There were so many around them now— around a hundred— that they were enough to make one's hair stand on end.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there was a small gap between the arrows that they could exploit.</p>

  <p>Randy led them through the wall of arrows. All of them stood sideways and slowly eased themselves through the gap.</p>

  <p>The wall of arrows was no joke. There were numerous arrows in front, behind, and on top of them. Blue light flashed all around them and the thought that they were surrounded by deadly projectiles containing Dragon Arsenic was very disconcerting.</p>

  <p>Once they passed through the wall, Randy did not let them rest. "Keep moving!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he gave the order, they heard a horrible wail come from somewhere not too far away.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!" a loud scream followed.</p>

  <p>"He... He got shot!" a warrior shouted, which cast fear on everyone's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately turned to look in the direction of the scream. Just a few hundred feet away from them was an empty space where a warrior had collapsed after being hit by an arrow.</p>

  <p>The warrior was a divine-level talent from the Star Field Divine Kingdom. The sight wasn't anything short of horrifying. His entire body emitted a blue glow and his skin almost immediately started to fester.</p>

  <p>The sight of his entire flesh boiling and wriggling as it fell from his bones was something that one would not forget easily.</p>

  <p>The group could only look in horror as the warrior's body hissed and fizzled until nothing was left of him.</p>

  <p>Randy had warned them that the Dragon Arsenic was an extremely potent poison, but none of them could've ever prepared themselves for such a scene. Even Camilla's face was noticeably paler.</p>

  <p>There was apparent fear in their eyes once they realized the gravity of their situation. Their group had witnessed firsthand just how deadly these arrows could be, but they knew they had to push on. All of them had already been aware of the possibility of death the moment they chose to explore the Feather Holy Sea. They just needed to be more careful if they wanted to survive.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Luo Zheng said, before turning to Randy. "I'll walk in front this time."</p>

  <p>According to convention, Randy should be the one to lead the group, but since it was Luo Zheng, he had no problems with the arrangement. The young man had time and again proven himself to be a trustworthy partner.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng in front, the group avoided the wall of arrows fearlessly.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were about to leave, a few figures suddenly appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Fredric!" Randy frowned slightly at the arrival of the team led by the crown prince of York Divine Kingdom. They shouldn't be here.</p>

  <p>According to his estimates, Fredric's group should've already passed through the Slow Arrow Area since they were at the very front. Did they come back?</p>

  <p>"There's no way out!" Fredric declared coldly once he saw them.</p>

  <p>"What? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Randy had come to this island before and knew that this was definitely the right path.</p>

  <p>"See for yourself!"</p>

  <p>Fredric pointed to the back helplessly.</p>
