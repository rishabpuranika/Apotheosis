  <p>
</p>

  <p>Janet had a special ability--she could distinguish if one was telling lies or not.</p>

  <p>When she declared that Tianxing was a fake name, everyone stared at Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng simply smiled and didn't explain. He believed that they shouldn't be too entangled with this issue.</p>

  <p>They continued climbing up the mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng scanned his surroundings, and an icy blue hall appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the great hall in front of him was built from blue crystals, which made it glimmer with an icy blue luster under the light.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they felt refreshed as they drew closer to the hall.</p>

  <p>The soles of Jeffrey's shoes scuffed against the ground when he slowed down his pace and turned to Janet.</p>

  <p>"How difficult is the third Hall of Causality?" he asked her. In turn, Janet looked at the hall for a while with a serious expression. "Every Hall of Causality is different, so I can't say for sure--but there are five Halls of Causality from the foot of the mountain to its summit in total.</p>

  <p>We had two ace talents in the group last time I entered here. No one died in the first Hall of Causality. Three people perished in the second. Four more followed in the third. I perished in the fourth Hall of Causality..."</p>

  <p>"So many people had died even though you had two ace talents in the group?!"</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist couldn't help but gawk at her in disbelief. There was not a single ace talent among the ten people present.</p>

  <p>Although they had never fought each other before, Luo Zheng, Jeffrey, and Janet were undoubtedly the top three warriors among them.</p>

  <p>However, they thought that while Luo Zheng and the others weren't weak--they were not on par with the ace talents. Those who were called ace talents must have the greatest fortune in the universe.</p>

  <p>Not only did they carry the destiny of the chaotic world, a race or clan's hopes depended on them as well.</p>

  <p>If even a team with two ace talents did not make through the Hall of Causality, then it meant that this Hall of Causality was much more difficult than they had imagined.</p>

  <p>Naturally, some of the eight people wanted to retreat after they heard Janet's words.</p>

  <p>However, Janet smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, isn't our result now better than last time?</p>

  <p>We'll definitely pass through this Hall of Causality as long as all of us work together!" She made sure to emphasize the two words 'work together' as she spoke.</p>

  <p>What Janet didn't mention was that the two ace talents from the last time she had entered the Hall of Causality refused to cooperate. They always fought internally, and even continued their fight on the mountain.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they didn't even save the other martial artists in danger when they saw them at all.</p>

  <p>If that hadn't been the case, the ten of them most likely would've passed through the fifth Hall of Causality last time.</p>

  <p>That was also why Janet emphasized teamwork from the very beginning, and thus their team performed better than the previous one. At the very least, only two people died in the second Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>"Janet is right. If we want to get more Illusion Points, we must cooperate with each other. Otherwise, no one will get far. But if we do, we might be able to get into the top 1000 this time!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng let out a hearty chuckle and joined in, "Everyone, come on. Let's go in!" After that, Luo Zheng took the lead and walked into the large hall.</p>

  <p>The hall's interiors were the same color as its exterior--from the ground, the ceiling, the columns, to even the walls on both sides of the hall were all an ice blue hue. Some of them touched the column and found it soothingly cool.</p>

  <p>"This Hall of Causality is really pretty," Janet sighed as she raised her head and looked around.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng and the others didn't feel the same way. Women were naturally interested in beautiful things. Even the woman from the Demon Night named Hailey was the same.</p>

  <p>A few minutes had passed. The crowd hadn't walked that far in the Hall of Causality before they abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they didn't want to advance, but rather, they couldn't: a ravine three thousand feet wide was in front of them.</p>

  <p>There was a strange stream of colors in the deep ravine, which was actually a flow of pure energy.</p>

  <p>Coleman stood at the edge of the ravine, stretched his neck and looked down.</p>

  <p>He looked ahead and said, "If we fall down, we'll probably be sent back directly to the main city! How can we cross it?!"</p>

  <p>It was only a thousand feet wide ravine. Normally, everyone should be able to fly through even a 100, 000 feet wide ravine. The problem was, it was now forbidden to fly in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we could jump over there," Jeffrey said as he looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>"You're right, it's not a big problem," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult to sprint across a distance of three thousand feet.</p>

  <p>But since this deep ravine had suddenly appeared in front of them, they couldn't just test their jumping abilities. Simply rushing in recklessly might just result in their deaths.</p>

  <p>It was like when they were in the second Hall of Causality. Everyone had quickly gone to the end of the hall but found a white grating that stood in front of them, blocking their path.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be something over there," Janet said and pointed to the left side of the hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked in the direction Janet was pointing, and saw ten icy blue stone tablets erected at the corner of the hall!</p>

  <p>He took a closer look through an icy blue stone tablet, and found a hook inside it.</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many hooks?" the ogre martial artist asked curiously.</p>

  <p>There was a long hook sealed within each of the ten stone tablets in front of them.</p>

  <p>At the end of each hook was a thin string of chains that were coiled together to an unknown length.</p>

  <p>'Ten?' Luo Zheng thought as he stared at the tablets.</p>

  <p>Then, he reached out and smacked one of them.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, rules of the heavens in the Hall of Causality stated that nothing in the hall could be broken.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng discovered that the tablet was incredibly brittle after he had smacked it. The large stone tablet then turned into a sparkling, translucent powder that scattered into the air, and the hook sealed inside it fell out.</p>

  <p>"This hook..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nimbly picked it up and tugged at the chain at the back of the hook.</p>

  <p>Although the chain was only as thick as a pinky finger, it didn't budge at all even under Zheng's strength. It couldn't be broken either.</p>

  <p>"There is indeed the protection of the heavens' rules. This hook cannot be broken," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Everyone followed suit when they saw Luo Zheng shatter the stone tablet and took out the hook inside it.</p>

  <p>The answer was getting clearer and clearer: these beautifully shaped hooks were prepared for them.</p>

  <p>The group that challenged the Hall of Causality originally had to gather ten people, but with two people dead, no one would take the hooks in the remaining two stone tablets.</p>

  <p>Coleman had smashed a tablet and gotten a hook. However, he was not satisfied. His gaze once again fell on the remaining two stone tablets. He tried to smash the two stone tablets to pieces, but they didn't even move an inch. They were completely unbreakable.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, it seemed that each person could only get one hook.</p>

  <p>After everyone had obtained a hook, all of them turned to Janet once again.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Janet innocently looked at Luo Zheng and muttered, "I also don't know what to do next…"</p>

  <p>Zheng's lips curved up into a small smile. He walked towards the deep ravine's edge as he looked on the other side.</p>

  <p>The opposite end of the deep ravine was shrouded in darkness, so they couldn't see whatever was in there clearly. However, Zheng's pupils shone with a green luster, and the black shadows on the other side gradually dissipated. Then, he saw some shadows that were shaking in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be something on the other side," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Janet immediately asked. Before the rules had been made clear, everyone had been unsure of their actions in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>They might be killed instantly if they weren't careful, so all of them were quite nervous.</p>

  <p>"I can't see it clearly," Luo Zheng said as the green light in his eyes glowed brighter. When he activated his vision ability, his expression suddenly changed and he shouted, "Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Just as when he finished his words, a hook from the darkness in the other side of the deep ravine rapidly shot towards them.</p>

  <p>Everyone heeded Zheng's warning and quickly moved to the two sides, but the hook was fast. It instantly crossed the distance of three thousand feet, and directly hung itself on the body of a human martial artist named Cain Li!</p>

  <p>After Cain was caught, he seemed powerless and couldn't resist at all. He only had enough time to scream for help, before he was pulled to the other side.</p>
