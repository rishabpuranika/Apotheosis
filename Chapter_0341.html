<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 341 The Seven Star Sword Light Platform (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If someone came in with a saber, they would not be allowed to enter the premise.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng drew closer to the crowd, he soon realised that there were two queues in front of him, one with many people while the other had much fewer people in comparison. He slightly knitted his eyebrows and wondered, 'Why two queues? Maybe it has the same rule as the entrance exam that those who got the written certificates of the noble clans would be offered privileges of waiting in the smaller queue?'</p>

  <p>In the long queue, a rough estimation was that there were over hundreds of people, and they still needed to wait until the disciples practising in the Seven Star Sword Light Platform got out. Anyone who got a glimpse of the situation would know a long time waiting was inevitable. What was more, as the time for the launch of All Peaks Competition was getting closer, almost all Cloud Sect disciples were working hard for it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the disciples outside would have to wait much longer than they usually did.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng didn't know was that some people in the long queue had been waiting for an entire day, and some even longer!</p>

  <p>As for the other queue, while people were also waiting in line, they didn't need to wait long before their turn, and meanwhile, there were only a dozen or so people waiting in line.</p>

  <p>Upon realising the facts, Luo Luo Zheng simply walked to the queue with fewer people.</p>

  <p>"Well, my friend, may I ask why there are fewer people in line here?" asked Luo Luo Zheng curiously.</p>

  <p>The man Luo Luo Zheng asked was a disciple clad in a black robe. After hearing his inquiry, he turned around, looked at him and saw that he was dressed in a white robe. With a disdainful look, he responded, "You had better line up in the other queue and stay there."</p>

  <p>"Why is that? Are you saying that the outer disciples in white robes are not allowed to be waiting in this queue?" Luo Luo Zheng asked such a brazen question only because he too realised that the people in this line were wearing black robes.</p>

  <p>The man sneered at him twice, snapping sharply, "Didn't you see the strength of the people in this queue? This queue is for those who are to enter the grade eight, nine, or even ten of the Seven Star Sword Light Platform! However, those without such strength should remain in the line over there, which is for those who are to enter the grade one to seven!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that is the case! I understand now..." Luo Luo Zheng said in a happy tone, nodding. Finally, he realised the underlying situation here.</p>

  <p>It turned out that this Seven Star Sword Light Platform had different rules and arrangements when compared to the Lake of the Magical Fish.</p>

  <p>Since the practice grade arrangement of Lake of the Magical Fish was designed long time ago, it was not so reasonable and suitable for now. As a result, every time Luo Luo Zheng dived into the Lake of the Magical Fish, he had to dive from the first level.</p>

  <p>The first hundred and fifty meters of the Lake of the Sea Fish were barely helpful to Luo Zheng's practice. Thus, it would waste a major chunk of his time during every practice.</p>

  <p>However, the situation in Seven Star Sword Light Platform was quite different, which was directly divided into several grades according to different strength of disciples.Those weaker disciples would choose the first to the seventh grade of the platform for their practice, while those with stronger strength would choose the eighth to tenth grade of the platform.</p>

  <p>The strength of those disciples wearing black robes in the queue here was not weak, basically with the grade seven to nine of the nature level, even one with the grade consummation, the top grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>No wonder they were waiting in line separately here.</p>

  <p>Based on the above knowledge, it would be easy for Luo Luo Zheng to choose to wait in which queue.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng didn't receive any training on the swordplay, and he was using the basic swordsmanship, if in terms of real fighting strength, he was not convinced that he would lose to the disciples in black standing in front of the queue. Since they chose to queue here, Luo Luo Zheng was also able to challenge the difficulty of over eighth grade.</p>

  <p>As a result, Luo Luo Zheng just stood quietly behind the short queue.</p>

  <p>After the disciple in front of Luo Luo Zheng turned back and saw that he had not moved, he responded in a loud and serious tone, "Why don't you move back to that queue? It seems like this is the first time you've come to the Seven Star Sword Light Platform? I would like to kindly remind you that choosing the level which suits you is the most important matter in the present. Although magic array is placed in this Seven Star Sword Light Platform, the Magnetic Aurora extracted from the polar magic stone is actually very powerful, and you may even get gravely injured if your strength is not enough to bear its attacking force! Weigh and understand your strength. Think twice before you jump to a conclusion. By the way, I strongly recommend you to line up over there!" As he finished his sentences, he pointed to the long queue parallel yet distant from the short one.</p>

  <p>His voice was so loud that it immediately drew the attention of the disciples from the long queue.</p>

  <p>Each practice at Seven Star Sword Light Platform not only consumed 40 points per hour, but also the price varied according to different grades Therefore, it was usually not affordable for the average outer disciples.</p>

  <p>Hence, one could assume that most of the disciples in the long queue were in black robes, while only a small number of them were in white robes, who were believed to come from rich families that could afford the cost.</p>

  <p>They did, however, now realise that Luo Luo Zheng was an outer disciple in white robe!</p>

  <p>All the disciples in the short queue were in black robe except Luo Luo Zheng, who was clad in a white robe, which made the crowds feel pretty weird and agitated, not to mention that Luo Luo Zheng had the lowest grade of nature level among other disciples in his queue, which made the situation worse.</p>

  <p>They basically were at grade seven or eight of the nature level, even one at the top grade of the nature level, while Luo Luo Zheng was only at grade two.</p>

  <p>At this sight, many people were secretly and silently laughing at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They thought to themselves that there were always some people in the world, who just did not know their own strengths and weaknesses; Luo Luo Zheng, the disciple in white robe really didn't know his own grade well; after he was seriously injured upon entering the Seven Star Sword Light Platform, he then would finally learn his lesson and get a better understanding of his real grade and capabilities...</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was aware of their sneer and sly arrogance, he simply chose to ignore it. As for the disciple's "good words", Luo Luo Zheng just smiled ever so gently and responded on a firm tone, "I am grateful for your kind suggestion, but I still stick to my decision and want to give this a shot!"</p>

  <p>As the disciple in front of Luo Luo Zheng realised that his kind persuasion was not working at all, he simply gave up, shook his head and whispered in a disappointed tone, "I am telling you, you are really biting off more than you can possibly chew!"</p>

  <p>After a while, Luo Luo Zheng saw a group of people walking out from the Seven Star Sword Light Platform, and the strength of those people appeared quite outstanding. Every one of them was a sword practitioner, carrying his sword on the back, instead of putting it in his Space Ring.</p>

  <p>A lot of sword practitioners, in order to be more aware of their sword intents chose to keep their swords close to them and no matter what kind of situation, they would not be separated from their swords.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the chests of those sword practitioners were showcasing the same symbol, a kind of rune, Luo Luo Zheng knew that they should be the elite inner disciples from a certain peak of the 33 Peaks.</p>

  <p>After that group came out, all the people in Luo Zheng's queue began to enter the field one by one.</p>
