<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Leroy had witnessed the most unimaginable things that had ever happened to Luo Luo Zheng. For example, Luo Luo Zheng experienced that attack from Yao earlier, and then there was the attack from that transparent giant, both of which were extremely powerful. Any Supreme Lord would have been severely injured or worse, dead, if they underwent any of these.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had miraculously survived all these attacks unscathed.</p>

  <p>After a person had worked so many wonders, if that same person claimed that he had some incredible abilities, it would be easy for people to accept him or her.</p>

  <p>With expectations deep down, Leroy was as excited as he could be.</p>

  <p>"Do it right now, Luo Luo Zheng!" Xun urged from the side.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head and raised up his hand. Just then, a faint light flashed from his space ring and a long sword fell vertically from it. But before the sword could plummet into the ground, Luo Luo Zheng had gripped it in his hand and aimed it directly at Leroy.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Xun asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>Leroy fumbled backwards, staring at Luo Luo Zheng in bewilderment. He had no clue what Luo Luo Zheng had in mind.</p>

  <p>"Don't move," said Luo Luo Zheng. He held the sword in his right hand, reached out two fingers in his left hand and pressed down along the hilt of the sword.</p>

  <p>Gradually, he dragged his fingers across the sword.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A misty ray of light began to rise from the surface of the sword. As the ray burst out, it did not emanate a powerful energy as they would have guessed. However, when Leroy and Xun saw it, they were mesmerized and hooked.</p>

  <p>It was as if the light could overpower all the laws of the world.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, is this what I think it is? The Enemy Repelling Arts you have practiced before?" Xun asked. In the Immortal Mansion, Xun had seen Luo Luo Zheng practice the Enemy Repelling Arts. However, Luo Luo Zheng did not master it at that time. Xun recalled this misty light and put two and two together.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled slightly. He knew he didn't need to hide anything from Xun, so he explained in all confidence, "It's the Causality Breaking Light that can break all causality! If the Five Aging Processes happens to be a kind of Law of Causality, then this should be enough to break it."</p>

  <p>Break all the causality?</p>

  <p>Was that even possible?</p>

  <p>As Leroy heard Luo Zheng's words, he widened his eyes in shock.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lords were powerful because each of them controlled a Heavenly Destiny and a Law of Causality. If Luo Luo Zheng could really cut off a Heavenly Destiny, then he would be the biggest enemy to the Supreme Lords. No Supreme Lord would be able to win over him.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng finished speaking, he shook his sword once again. The Causality Breaking Light of the sword burst out and extended four feet beginning at the tip of the sword. Suddenly, he leapt upwards and headed down towards Leroy.</p>

  <p>The sword did not make any contact with Leroy. However, the four-foot long light pierced through his body like a dagger to his heart.</p>

  <p>The Five Aging Processes was a very special state. All people knew was that warriors above the Soul Sea Realm would face it when they reached a certain age. No one knew why there was such a state or how to break it.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng himself didn't know the answer.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng's sword slashed through Leroy, his body let out a huge, deafening wail.</p>

  <p>The sound startled Xun, and even Leroy himself.</p>

  <p>"Ah?"</p>

  <p>As a Supreme Lord, Leroy had a deep understanding of his own body. If there was something going on, he would be knowledgeable of it in an instant. But right now, he was flailing around anxiously, in awe at where the screaming might come from.</p>

  <p>"Drip! Drip! Drip!"</p>

  <p>Aside from the screeching, streams of foul-smelling liquid began to flow out from Leroy's armpits. The place he was in for the closed-door cultivation was already extremely smelly, now the smell was even stronger?</p>

  <p>"What... what's happening with me?" Demon Night members had exceptional hygiene, so Leroy was extremely disgusted with his own self at this point.</p>

  <p>After a while, streams of filth began to flow out from his ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, too. Amongst the liquid floated bits and pieces of other creatures, and no one knew how they had entered Leroy's body.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng and Xun knew that the Five Aging Processes had something to do with the special creatures in the liquid.</p>

  <p>"My queen, could you leave me alone..."</p>

  <p>Although Leroy was usually very tolerant, the liquid gushing out of his body made him nauseous. He wanted to beg Xun and Luo Luo Zheng to leave.</p>

  <p>Knowing exactly what Leroy was feeling, the two left him in his place of cultivation and patiently waited. In the palace above the holy tree, Luo Luo Zheng and Xun joined the Demon Night members to wait.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Xun and Leroy were happy to see the change. The stench emitted by warriors who had entered Five Aging Processes was impossible to wash away. After several attempts, the odor would return in vengeance. Even worse, the originally pure flesh would begin to get tainted with impurities, causing the body to age even faster.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's slash caused the stench on Leroy, Xun was filled with anticipation. And though she could not figure out why she felt such a way, Luo Zheng's method at least proved to work.</p>

  <p>After they waited for less than an hour, an old man suddenly appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng and Xun.</p>

  <p>This old man wore an immaculate white robe, and he looked very well kept. His face was full of creases and lines as he looked very aged, yet his eyes were sparkling with vigor.</p>

  <p>The members of Demon Night took a look at Leroy in a daze. They were stunned for a moment.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members of the Square Spirit Sacred Place knew that Leroy had been cultivating in seclusion here. When Leroy arrived, he was an old man who probably had one foot in the grave. He no longer radiated the look and energy of a Supreme Lord, and he smelled repulsive too.</p>

  <p>However, the man before them looked extremely old, but the stench had completely dissipated. Moreover, his spirit felt very different. It was as if he had transformed into a completely different person.</p>

  <p>"The state of Five Aging Processes is really lifted?" Xun was also staring blankly at Leroy, blinking rapidly.</p>

  <p>Age was never a problem of a Supreme Lord. For as long as Leroy could be filled with enough life energy, he had the capability to appear however he wanted. He would be able to turn back to a middle-aged man or even become a youth again... Whatever age or form, was his choice.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Leroy bowed deeply towards Luo Luo Zheng with cupped hands.</p>

  <p>For a Supreme Lord to perform such a great courtesy to Luo Luo Zheng, it was obvious he had a great debt of gratitude towards Luo Luo Zheng. After all, Luo Zheng's act graced him with rebirth, and was equivalent to bestowing Leroy a second life.</p>

  <p>After thanking Luo Luo Zheng, Leroy bowed towards Xun. He was quite excited. "Many thanks to Luo Luo Zheng and my queen for your help, but I still have one question. After the Five Aging Processes are removed, how do I calculate my lifespan?"</p>

  <p>In the past, warriors at the Soul Sea Realm and above would die after entering the Five Aging Processes. It was something everyone would face sooner or later, which made it a fair rule.</p>

  <p>However, after Leroy's Five Aging Processes were removed by Luo Luo Zheng, did that mean that they wouldn't happen to him anymore? Did that mean Leroy just garnered eternal life?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng furrowed his eyebrows in thought. Then, he pondered for a moment and said with a smile, "That seems right. If the Five Aging Processes do not come to you, Supreme Lord, you possess the same ability as a True God... to be immortal!"</p>

  <p>The pursuit of immortality was a topic that would never lose its novelty.</p>

  <p>Only after one entered divine land and became a True God could they get the chance of living forever. There was no creature in the Evolutionary Universe that had ever achieved immortality.</p>

  <p>Just like Livingston for instance, who had to use the puppet to pursue immortality. However, the puppet body could not be defined as a living being.</p>

  <p>"Right now the entire universe is in danger," said Xun with a smile.</p>

  <p>"First we have to defeat the Sacred race. Forget about immortality, whether or not we can survive this thousand years will be the main problem."</p>

  <p>Overall, the war with the Sacred race was the major problem faced by all the races in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "Maha has been rampant in the Sunflower Water World for a while now. Let's get prepared. The war is coming."</p>

  <p>For days, Maha had been fighting alone in the Sunflower Water World against the other geniuses of the Evolutionary Universe. With the battles, he was suppressing the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe, so the morale of the universe had been declining. All of these put the Celestial Position at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>After settling the internal strife of the Demon Night, Luo Luo Zheng knew that the time for the showdown with the Sacred race was coming.</p>
