  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of thousands of lakes of different sizes in the Roaring Lake Province.</p>

  <p>The Clear Sky Lake in the middle was the largest. If one were to look down from the sky, it would look like a magnificent gem embedded on the horizon.</p>

  <p>A bright ball of light suddenly rose from the Roaring Lake Province, shocking all the creatures that were watching.</p>

  <p>They stared at the light ball in the sky, unable to grasp what had happened.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the terrifying shock wave reached them.</p>

  <p>Along with this shock wave, a water wave that was thousands of meters high, spread out towards them.</p>

  <p>With the Clear Sky Lake as the center, everything within tens of thousands of miles around was swept up by the wave.</p>

  <p>It took four hours for the lake to finally return to a peaceful state.</p>

  <p>The surface of the Clear Sky Lake had sunk more than eighty thousand feet, leaving only a pool of dirty water behind.</p>

  <p>The three black ships lay askew on this pool, their surfaces cracked and blood flowing out of ship decks from time to time.</p>

  <p>The sound of blood gurgling and the former captain's pained groan sounded through the mayhem.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship had suffered a lot over the years, some ships even having been completely crushed and burnt.</p>

  <p>But the captain had been well prepared then.</p>

  <p>The destruction of one or two black ships was like cutting off an arm or a leg. Since the captain's cultivation base was at the Eternal Realm, it wasn't as big a problem.</p>

  <p>The black ships in the Roaring Lake Province were his only remaining body parts.</p>

  <p>These several black ships were seriously damaged, and the black ship carrying the Evil God was smashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>This was a huge blow to the captain.</p>

  <p>Shera and the Evil God were on the same ship when the explosions occurred.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the captain had sensed that something was wrong and extracted Shera from the cabin in time.</p>

  <p>Even so, Shera had been sent smashing into the side of the black ship, thanks to the shock wave. Her body had become embedded in the deck, and many parts of her body were torn open.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>When Shera woke up, she could hear the sound of the black ships being reconstructed.</p>

  <p>The captain was trying his best to repair the black ships.</p>

  <p>If someone were to attack him now, the captain wouldn't even have the strength to escape.</p>

  <p>"Captain..." Shera called out. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>The battle of the Li Shan mountain had ended just a while ago.</p>

  <p>The Source World should logically have experienced a period of peace after the battle.</p>

  <p>Neither the Li Shan mountain nor the Bearing race could start another war, given how the scale of that war could affect them.</p>

  <p>Shera had just come to a conclusion when the captain said, "It's the Ways-blending Energy."</p>

  <p>"The Ways-blending Energy? How is it even possible?" Shera exclaimed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The Evil God wouldn't use too much energy if he were to integrate the Divine Dao. The Ways-blending Energy was unstable and its power was extraordinary, but it was impossible for it to cause such a huge damage.</p>

  <p>"I saw it with my own eyes," the captain said affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"Then the Evil God..." Shera's voice trembled.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>The white light ball had devoured the body of the Evil God when it had exploded.</p>

  <p>The captain hadn't gotten a chance to save the Evil God, and he even hadn't been able to protect himself.</p>

  <p>Shera struggled to get to her feet before she took a few steps on the lake, her spiritual sense spreading out quickly.</p>

  <p>The lake had shrunk considerably, making it easy for Shera's spiritual sense to cover it.</p>

  <p>She couldn't find any trace of the Evil God within the range of her spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"Has he disappeared?" Shera muttered.</p>

  <p>"That energy was so powerful that it might have caused him to evaporate," the captain said.</p>

  <p>It was very easy to destroy a person with such terrifying energy.</p>

  <p>Now that they couldn't find the Evil God, it was highly possible that he had evaporated and that there was nothing left of him.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't die like this!" Shera said excitedly.</p>

  <p>The captain hesitated for a while before he said, "Let's stay here and wait."</p>

  <p>The Nihility race had invested a lot in the Evil God. If the Evil God died like this, it would be a great loss to the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Shera continued to float in the air and was about to expand her range when she suddenly sensed a force coming from up ahead.</p>

  <p>Her reflexes told her to dodge it, but the force was too powerful. Before she could react, it turned into a big hand and grabbed her. And then, a huge figure appeared in front of her.</p>

  <p>The Evil God!</p>

  <p>"Evil God... Captain! You're alright!" Shera exclaimed, surprised.</p>

  <p>"How could I die in such a lowly manner?" the Evil God sneered.</p>

  <p>He raised Shera, placed her on his shoulder, and looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had an extraordinary sensibility in the Source World.</p>

  <p>He could sense that there was something unusual in the sky above the Roaring Lake Province. Two looming channels floated up there, some people peeping down through them.</p>

  <p>"What's in the sky?" Shera asked.</p>

  <p>"Some creatures are observing me," the Evil God answered, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Who?" Shera's frown matched the Evil God's.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. There seems to be two people..."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he stretched out a hand upwards, an energy spiral forming at his fist.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The energy spiral was like a giant dragon soaring into the sky. It crashed into one of the channels, shattering it to pieces.</p>

  <p>In the Jade Pure Realm, Alphonse squeezed the mirror into pieces and dropped them to the ground.</p>

  <p>He smirked and turned to leave when the human woman exclaimed,</p>

  <p>"General, look!"</p>

  <p>The scene in the mirror had earlier been blurry.</p>

  <p>It was even more difficult to see now that the mirror had been shattered thus.</p>

  <p>Alphonse stretched out a hand and gently touched the fragments of the mirror. The fragments pieced together quickly and became a whole. It was almost as if they had souls.</p>

  <p>When the mirror was pieced together, the human woman said, "That person is not dead. He seems to have discovered the Snake Masters' observation channel. What an alert and sharp fellow!"</p>

  <p>"He wants to destroy the channel," said Alphonse.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>It was then that they saw the Evil God's punch coming their way.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened after this punch. The scene in the mirror was blurred, but it still existed.</p>

  <p>"Did he miss the target?" the human woman asked.</p>

  <p>Alphonse stared at the mirror, lost in thought. He then shook his head and said, "It doesn't seem like he failed to hit the channel. He has broken another channel. I think there's another one in addition to the Snake Masters' observation channel."</p>

  <p>"Another observation channel? Are those birds also observing him?" the human woman asked.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," said Alphonse, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>The birds controlled the Nihility race, and the Nihility race controlled the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Now that the Evil God and the Black Ship were a whole, it was easier to observe the Evil God. There was no need for the birds to observe him in this way.</p>

  <p>"But who else will observe him apart from us and the birds?" The human woman was curious.</p>

  <p>Was there a third force on the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet..."</p>

  <p>Alphonse had barely finished speaking when the Evil God's fist swung upwards once again.</p>

  <p>An energy spiral soared into the sky and finally destroyed the Snake Masters' observation channel.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Square City, the scenes in more than twenty mirrors of various sizes disappeared at the same time.</p>

  <p>Alphonse's eyes seemed to brighten with an inexplicable joy as he looked at the blank mirror.</p>
