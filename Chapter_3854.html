<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3854 Fuxi's Great Strength </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A small shadow soared through the air and crashed into the side of an enormous stone mountain, well over ten thousand feet in height. It had stood there, solid and immovable, for thousands of years. As soon as the shadow hit the stones, the mountain collapsed as though it had never existed.</p>

  <p>Deep rumbling sounds echoed as the mountain crumbled from the force of the impact.</p>

  <p>The huge mountain had been destroyed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The stone shards of the mountain flew out in all directions. Many were sharp and deadly, and pierced through the nearby creatures like airborne weapons.</p>

  <p>Most of the stabbed creatures died immediately. For all who lived in the mountain area, this day was the end of their world.</p>

  <p>As the rumbles of the collapsing mountain began to fade, there was a strange buzzing noise.</p>

  <p>A mark of the Eight Diagrams had appeared on the ruins of the mountain. A closer inspection revealed that the outer layer of the mark was blurry, because it was actually formed by the overlapping of many marks.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>A boom sounded.</p>

  <p>For a moment, time seemed to stop and stand still.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's arms were barely visible as he landed thousands of punches in very, very rapid succession. The speed and force of the punches released a great energy that flowed down from the ruins of the mountain.</p>

  <p>But the buzzing sound continued.</p>

  <p>The various noises merged with each other, each loud enough to obscure the original sounds, until only a continuous high-pitched note could be heard.</p>

  <p>The overlapping marks of the Eight Diagrams exploded simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The ground began to sink beneath the rubble of the mountain.</p>

  <p>One thousand feet, ten thousand feet, one hundred thousand feet, one million feet...</p>

  <p>The Source World was hollow, and almost all of its living beings lived in the inner layer. The outer layer was not thick. The thickest part was only sixty million feet at most, and the thinnest part was only a few million feet.</p>

  <p>The majority of the exit points from the Source World were located in the weak spots of the outer layer.</p>

  <p>The Separate Amber Province was itself located in a weak spot. The distance from its surface to the chaos outside was only more than ten million feet. Now, through sheer force, Fuxi had smashed it through.</p>

  <p>In the chaos, the Xuanyuan Sword exuded a golden light, ensuring the protection of the Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>The golden light contained a holy way with the strongest defensive power.</p>

  <p>However, even with such protection, the Xuanyuan was still in a sorry state.</p>

  <p>He had felt very confident since the defeat of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Element Spirit race, his strength had improved by leaps and bounds. He became much more skillful in the use of his bloodline and the combination of Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi? who used to be honored as the strongest warrior at the Eternal Realm? was just an amateur. However, with his talent and fierce pursuit in the Three Purities Stage, he achieved what he had today.</p>

  <p>Now, in the middle of the battle, the Xuanyuan realized that he had underestimated Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Fuxi didn't have many techniques. He didn't even rely on any Other Shore Token. He was simply strong.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's relentless attack penetrated through the weak spot.</p>

  <p>As he penetrated through the ground of Separate Amber Province, chaotic energy poured in through the hole, spreading throughout the province.</p>

  <p>The energy burst into the Source World, emitting a buzzing noise.</p>

  <p>The first wisp of chaotic energy swept past the rubble and came into contact with a blade of grass. In an instant, the green grass withered, blackened, and died.</p>

  <p>For weaker creatures, chaotic energy was a deadly poison.</p>

  <p>Many creatures in the vast Source World did not have the strength to resist the chaotic energy. Most of the aborigines in the Separate Amber Province would die.</p>

  <p>"Your sword is very good. It saved your life," said Fuxi calmly, standing at the entrance of the hole.</p>

  <p>Although he stood over one thousand feet away, his voice was clear and loud.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan floated in the chaos. He withdrew his sword and said grimly, "The sword is a part of me."</p>

  <p>A lifeblood weapon was refined with one's own bloodline, so the Xuanyuan's statement made sense.</p>

  <p>"I knew the strength of your sword a long time ago," Fuxi replied. "If the Element Spirit race hadn't helped you to refine it, I would have broken it already." Fuxi spoke in a confident tone, as he stood in front of a hole he had punched through the very fabric of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Especially now, he felt incomparably strong, as though there was nothing in the world that he couldn't break.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan slowly raised his sword above his head. "Everyone has their own lucky chances. I was lucky that I got the help of the Element Spirit race, and you were also lucky because you got the secret blood inheritance."</p>

  <p>As he talked, the Xuanyuan Sword emitted a golden light, and three holy ways appeared. They were one of his most powerful theurgies.</p>

  <p>"But luck isn't the most important factor! In the end, strength and weakness matter the most," said the Xuanyuan. With a gentle motion, he shook his long sword.</p>

  <p>The three holy ways intertwined and headed straight for Fuxi in the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>"Today you will learn what real strength is!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi said coldly. He did not try to evade the attack. He stood directly in its path and raised his fist as he saw the three holy ways rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>He didn't care what kind of token the Xuanyuan used. He was certain that whatever attack came his way, he would be able to block it and smash it into pieces.</p>

  <p>The holy ways swooped towards him.</p>

  <p>Several marks of the Eight Diagrams appeared on the holy ways. Fuxi threw several punches, and the marks immediately exploded.</p>

  <p>But the holy ways were not broken by the explosion. They seemed like illusions, impervious to the impact of Fuxi's blows.</p>

  <p>The holy ways seemed to be both concrete and ethereal, and they behaved in an unpredictable manner.</p>

  <p>"Fists are not enough for the holy ways," the Xuanyuan said with a sneer. "Now let's see if you have any real strength."</p>

  <p>The three illusory holy ways surrounded Fuxi, and cracks began to form in the golden light. Soon, the holy ways reformed into a thin net that enclosed Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan left his spot.</p>

  <p>In an instant, he appeared outside the net. He gazed at Fuxi, trapped within the crisscrossing lines.</p>

  <p>The golden light emanated continuously from the surface of the Xuanyuan Sword. He thrust the sword forward, and a terrifying energy was released from the thin strands of the net. Every line turned into sharp golden sword radiance, shrinking towards Fuxi in the center of the net.</p>

  <p>"Shatter!" commanded the Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>Instantly, it was as though thousands of swords slashed at Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan launched this attack with all his strength.</p>

  <p>He was so focused that his very bloodline seemed to boil, and his eyes glowed with a golden light. He put all his energy into attacking Fuxi, wanting to tear him to pieces.</p>

  <p>The golden sword radiance slashed into Fuxi's body.</p>

  <p>The net had shrunk and now completely enveloped Fuxi until he was no longer visible.</p>

  <p>In that moment, the sword radiance exploded, and it was so bright that even the sun looked dim in comparison.</p>

  <p>In the far distance, the powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race paused briefly amid their fighting to glance at the golden glow of sword radiance on the horizon.</p>

  <p>However, the Xuanyuan was not Emperor Di Jun. The swordsmanship he cultivated was completely different from Emperor Di Jun's Nine-Sun World Destruction token.</p>

  <p>Several moments passed before the golden light dissipated completely.</p>

  <p>Something unexpected had happened. When the Xuanyuan saw the result of his attack, his eyes widened, and one eyelid began twitching with alarm.</p>

  <p>Fuxi stood there, entirely unharmed. He wore a slight, sardonic smile as he said, "Well, you said my fists are weak, but your sword seems even weaker!</p>

  <p>You have no true strength!</p>

  <p>You are weak."</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes glinted as he repeated, "Weak!"</p>

  <p>With that final word, Fuxi vanished.</p>

  <p>The marks of the Eight Diagrams appeared and rushed towards the Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>Fuxi came into view, threw a punch, and disappeared again.</p>

  <p>The Xuanyuan couldn't follow Fuxi's motions because he was moving at an unimaginable speed. Every time he caught a glimpse of Fuxi, he was in a different position. This made it difficult, if not impossible, for the Xuanyuan to launch a counterattack.</p>

  <p>This put the Xuanyuan at a severe disadvantage. He was forced to passively wait to see what Fuxi planned to do, without any chance to fight back.</p>
