  <p>
</p>

  <p>The illusions that Elder Xue and the others faced were much more advanced than the one Geoffrey had encountered.</p>

  <p>However, in terms of life-or-death struggles, both the Elemental race and Elder Xue had been more experienced than Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>It was no exaggeration to state that all warriors who qualified to enter the Levitation Tower had already come to regard life and death as unimportant details, and a life-or-death test wasn't really anything that concerned them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Geoffrey didn't wait long before Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race had safely accomplished the illusions.</p>

  <p>Upon passing the test, Elder Xue turned to confirm Geoffrey's safety immediately. He was relieved to see that the young man was unscathed.</p>

  <p>"What was your answer to the question?" Elder Xue asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I answered it with honesty. I admitted that I'm afraid of death," said Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Oh? Truly?" Elder Xue was taken aback by this unexpected answer, but he quickly understood the reasoning behind it.</p>

  <p>Everyone who entered the Levitation Tower knew there was a great likelihood of dying. Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race had boldly stated that they were not afraid of death; hence, they had faced much more severe life-or-death challenges.</p>

  <p>In particular, Elder Xue had been subject to hundreds of cycles of birth and death in the limited period of time. If it had been Geoffrey, he would have been overwhelmed and succumbed to the pain.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's weakness actually worked to his advantage because his tests in the Levitation Tower had a much lower level of difficulty than the other warriors'. If he continued to advance at this pace, it might not be as difficult for him to pass all the tests.</p>

  <p>"Let's move on!"</p>

  <p>Once the red line disappeared, the four of them continued to ascend the spiraling stairs of the Levitation Tower.</p>

  <p>Sixty feet...</p>

  <p>Seventy feet...</p>

  <p>Eighty feet...</p>

  <p>When they reached the level that was ninety feet away from the starting point, the mysterious consciousness raised another question:</p>

  <p>"Who will you choose to save in a crisis?"</p>

  <p>Before Geoffrey could answer it, his consciousness was drawn into an illusion again. He saw the same little girl in the illusion. This time, she gave Geoffrey a chance to save his own life or the lives of ten thousand other people. He would have to either sacrifice his life for the ten thousand people, or sacrifice their lives for his own.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's sense of self-preservation quickly answered. He selected his own survival with almost no hesitation at all. For the young man, his life was much more valuable than those of irrelevant strangers!</p>

  <p>Moreover, Elder Xue had repeatedly emphasized the importance of being honest, and that meant he should answer the Levitation Tower's questions with absolute honesty. He was very confident in his honest answer.</p>

  <p>In the illusion, those innocent people were slowly submerged in lethal lava. The little girl watched beside Geoffrey. "Cold-blooded," she commented. Then, the illusion immediately disappeared from his mind.</p>

  <p>Soon, Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race also passed through the test without a hitch.</p>

  <p>After passing through three tests in a row, Geoffrey's expression had become greatly relaxed. "Elder Xue, these are actually not soul tests. They didn't involve the strength of soul, nor the level of power," he remarked. "I think they were more like designed to test our humanity..."</p>

  <p>"I totally agree." Elder Xue nodded.</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't be all that difficult to pass these tests," said Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>It was hard for him to believe that no one from the six great races of the Deep Space had managed to pass through the Levitation Tower for a great many years.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue chuckled and replied, "Although the Elemental race, the Cold Ape race, and the Wrona race are powerful, their civilizations are still at a barbaric stage. They possess a poorly developed humanity."</p>

  <p>In fact, even though Elder Xue had previously figured out the key to success lay in not lying to the Levitation Tower, he had never entered the tower himself before. No matter how bright he was, it was impossible for him to guess at the contents of the tests, and he couldn't draw them out of thin air. Therefore, it was most fortunate that they had already come this far.</p>

  <p>Next, they underwent three more tests each time they advanced another thirty feet, and they were drawn into three similar illusions.</p>

  <p>These illusions repeatedly tested their humanity in different ways. It wasn't all that difficult for Geoffrey or Elder Xue since they both stuck to answering truthfully according to their hearts. Unfortunately, one member of the Elemental race failed to be honest and was killed at the last test.</p>

  <p>The remaining three of them all passed the height of one hundred and eighty feet and headed straight for the height of two hundred feet. It was the highest record, and while two members of the Elemental race had achieved it only a few days ago, it had cost their lives.</p>

  <p>Both Elder Xue and Geoffrey were curious as to what they would encounter from here on.</p>

  <p>As they ascended the spiraling staircase, they soon discovered that there was a transparent barrier at the height of two hundred feet, and it blocked their way ahead.</p>

  <p>It resembled a transparent glazed door, blocking in the stairway, and dozens of gray masses could be seen floating inside the transparent object.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey stepped forward and gently touched the transparent barrier. The moment his fingertips touched the surface, layers of ripples appeared, circling outwards. This large transparent barrier appeared to be made up of water!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's touch seemed to have activated those gray things. One of these quickly approached the surface of the water near Geoffrey's hand. It suddenly turned into a large gray mouth, biting fiercely towards him.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the large gray mouth wasn't able to escape the surface of the liquid. It could only flatten and spread inside the liquid. Geoffrey was so frightened, he sat on the ground, and the grey matter quickly turned back into its normal state and retracted.</p>

  <p>"What the hell was that?" Geoffrey's face turned white with fright.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue furrowed his brows. This transparent object obstructed the only passageway. If they wanted to move ahead, they apparently had no other choice but to swim across the liquid.</p>

  <p>The two members of the Elemental race who had made it to this point before must have died in the water. Judging from the current situation, would they also die at this place?</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!" noticing Elder Xue's melancholy face, the last remaining member of the Elemental race offered, and then went straight into the liquid. Of course, he was not blind to the dangers inside.</p>

  <p>However, these members of the Elemental race were all very respectful to Elder Xue. He was willing to sacrifice himself to discover a way ahead for Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue tried to stop him, but it was too late. As soon as the man plunged into the liquid, one of the gray things immediately noticed him.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The gray thing turned into a large mouth and chomped on his head. Then it transformed into a gray mist, which invaded his brain. The man panicked at this development.</p>

  <p>When he realized that he was still alive, he waved at Elder Xue to comfort him, and then swam towards the far end of the liquid. When he was about to leave the liquid, his eyes suddenly rolled to the back of his head, and he involuntarily clutched at his head with his hands. His expression became greatly contorted, as if he was suffering from intense pain.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue had taught them how to endure pain. Their wills had actually become much stronger than that of ordinary creatures. Since he was so overwhelmed by pain, it wasn't hard to imagine what severe tortures he might be suffering.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Geoffrey asked in a tone laced with trepidation.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound echoed from within the liquid. The man's head suddenly exploded, and a cloud of gray mist emerged again.</p>

  <p>The headless corpse of the man slowly floated in the water until it reached the edge and was finally expelled from the water to drop to the ground before Geoffrey and Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Since the headless corpse had crossed the green lines, it was quickly turned to ashes by the Levitation Tower.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey stood transfixed into silence for several minutes before he asked,</p>

  <p>"We can't pass through this place at all. Shall we turn back now?"</p>
