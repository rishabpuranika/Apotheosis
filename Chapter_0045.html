  <p>Everyone's attention was drawn to Luo Luo Zheng and the astonishing Mu Ning he was sending out.</p>

  <p>Even the large group of noble clan disciples that stood further away looked over with spirited looks. Everyone seemed to pivot their attention toward what was happening automatically.</p>

  <p>"Haha, Billy sucks. He led a group of people against a weak person from the bottom. Shouldn't he know that a cornered dog will jump over the wall in desperation? I guess this boy is building up the strength to fight back," a young noble clansman dressed in white shaking his jade fan whispered.</p>

  <p>"So what? Trust me. You are way over-thinking this. Although this boy is in a desperate situation, he's not strong enough to strike back. Moreover, he is just at the organ refining level, and there's no way he could fight someone that much stronger than him. But, then again, Billy really knows how to have fun, to even bother dealing with a guy at the organ refining level..." another noble clansman nodded in agreement with what he heard.</p>

  <p>The bodyguard, however, standing beside him saluted, glanced at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "Mr. Huo, you will take part in the Blooded Test later. You'd better watch out for this young man."</p>

  <p>"Why? What do you mean 'watch out for this young man'? Tell me what you know." Mr. Huo asked patiently. Mr. Huo knew his bodyguard wouldn't speak up for no reason, and things must be not as simple as they seemed.</p>

  <p>His bodyguard had spent many years at the nature level and was strong.</p>

  <p>Besides, he recently safely returned from the cruel Shura battlefield as a master at reading people. Mr. Huo trusted him a lot.</p>

  <p>The bodyguard continued, "I don't know why, exactly, but I have a feeling, even though he is only at organ refining level, he is a very dangerous and mighty opponent. We'd better be careful."</p>

  <p>Hearing his trusted bodyguard, Mr. Huo raised his eyebrows. He noted with interest, "Things are getting more interesting. So, Billy will be in a little trouble this time."</p>

  <p>The relationship of the young men from these noble clans was not unbreakable, and they were not united as one. There were even differences among some noble families. So, Mr. Huo didn't think that he had to warn Billy. Even his bodyguard gave Luo Luo Zheng a very high evaluation, and he still believed that for Billy, it was just a small trifle. Billy could handle Luo Luo Zheng perfectly fine.</p>

  <p>As one noble clan was to others, only the disciples from noble clans clearly knew Billy's abilities.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Perrin and those young noble clansmen all wore long faces. Apparently, Luo Zheng's words roused echoes in their hearts.</p>

  <p>The butterfly jade pendant was deftly spun and turned in between Billy's fingers quietly. His face was calm, but Billy's eyes flashed with an intent to kill. "Death to you, in fact, is the most relaxed way to relief. I have a lot of ways to render you pain in a living death. Want to think it over again?"</p>

  <p>"I don't need to! My life may be a humble one, but keep in mind, I won't die easily!" snapped Luo Luo Zheng sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for, brother? Cut the crap! Stop wasting time! Kill him!" Unable to stand by waiting any longer, a tall young man rushed out from behind Billy. He raised his fist and brought it down squarely on Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>The young man's strength was at the peak of marrow refining level!</p>

  <p>A series of runes subtly flowed over both of his fists, which was a strong fist position.</p>

  <p>As powerful as the punch was, Luo Luo Zheng?didn't flinch. Instead, he raised his fist to meet the oncoming powerful punch!</p>

  <p>The people watching shook their heads, thinking that although Luo Luo Zheng had determination, he shouldn't have talked the way he did. To beat a master in the marrow refining level with his organ refining level, was like pounding a stone using an egg. Luo Luo Zheng fought against a noble clansman. The practicing theories of someone in a noble clan were far greater than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Such a hard thrust could break Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>Nory wasn't standing far away. His mouth opened wide, and his eyes were full of worry. Nory knew Luo Zheng's strength and that he wasn't as weak as he looked, but he did not see the last scene yesterday. In his mind, even though Luo Luo Zheng was not simple, there was no way he could win against a master at the peak of marrow refining level. This time, Luo Luo Zheng was in big trouble.</p>

  <p>But, what everyone presumed, did not happen.</p>

  <p>The two fists made contact with a loud?"Cra-ack!" as flesh and bone made contact with bone and muscle.</p>

  <p>All they could see was Luo Luo Zheng?still standing in the same place, his legs firmly under him on the ground. A warm flow circulated through his body, and offset the strength of the punch that the tall young man sent to him.</p>

  <p>The tall young man, however, stumbled back several paces, almost falling to the ground, his hand falling to his side, wounded, and his face was flushed.</p>

  <p>The majority of people did not expect the result and were surprised, and they looked at Luo Luo Zheng with a faint touch of admiration. To take on the strength of marrow refining level with the strength of organ refining level, this was not something any ordinary person could do. But Luo Luo Zheng did!</p>

  <p>In particular, watching Luo Luo Zheng teach a lesson to a noble clansman, in the presence of over one thousand grassroots members, left an unspeakable pleasure in their hearts.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Billy's people could no longer stay quiet. They shouted as they surrounded Luo Luo Zheng intent on attacking him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took a deep breath and narrowed his eyes. If they rushed him, then the only thing he could do was to try harder. He would not wait for his doom, but, he would fight! Even if he didn't kill them all, he would take as many as he could before his life ended.</p>

  <p>At this point, a booming voice was heard, "What the fuck are you doing?</p>

  <p>Today is your Blooded Test day. You are not here to fight each other!"</p>

  <p>Looking around, they saw thirty chariots headed towards them, and the one who shouted stood on the first flying chariot. Joshua wore ragged overalls and had a squared face. He was the supervisor of the Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>Joshua jumped off the flying chariot and strode up to Luo Luo Zheng purposely, demanding loudly, "Who was fighting just now?"</p>

  <p>"It was him! He was fighting, examiner!" accused Perrin as he stepped forward pointing at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It takes two to fight. Who is the other one?" asked Joshua.</p>

  <p>"It was me," admitted the tall young man from Wang Clan.</p>

  <p>Joshua nodded and said gravely, "Very well, your eligibility?to compete in the Blooded Test is canceled!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face paled immediately. It would be unfair if he were disqualified. He was forced to defend himself. "Examiner, I didn't start the fight. I was forced into fighting. Why should I be disqualified from the test?"</p>

  <p>"No matter who you are, if you dare to fight here, then you should have the mindfulness that you will be driven out of the Cloud Sect, without exception!" Joshua did not want to listen to Luo Zheng's explanation at all. He asked nothing more before making his decision.</p>
