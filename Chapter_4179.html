  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dale had told Zheng of how they had communicated with Geoffrey before.</p>

  <p>Now that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord mentioned it, Zheng was naturally filled with a great deal of concern. He gestured to Lorena and Rosie to be silent.</p>

  <p>Everyone quieted down, their hearts filled with all sorts of strange feelings.</p>

  <p>How was it possible for Geoffrey to communicate with them through this sword?</p>

  <p>Was he trapped in it?</p>

  <p>Tianming carried the Other Shore Token and could now feel the power of the vibrations, but what did such intermittent vibrations mean?</p>

  <p>The sword vibrated for a while before the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said with an odd expression, "He says that he has found another holy pillar, and he can connect the line of the Lone Sword there."</p>

  <p>"Does that mean the Lone Sword can get stronger?" asked Zheng hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, nodding. "Its ability may change as well."</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes lit up in surprise. "Sir, do you mean that Geoffrey is capable of modifying the Lone Sword's ability?"</p>

  <p>With a faint hint of a smile, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said,</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey is on the pillar. He can modify the abilities of the Lone Sword and other Other Shore Tokens. He just happened to find the Lone Sword."</p>

  <p>"That's unbelievable!" Tianming exclaimed in absolute shock.</p>

  <p>He had sensed a change in the sword's ability before, but he could not understand how it had happened. His understanding of Other Shore Tokens was limited to the Other Shore after all. He had never even thought of the world outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected his Lone Sword's change would have something to do with Geoffrey, and yet it was his modification that had given the sword such great power.</p>

  <p>Mike, Bromley, and Holy Jay were just as astonished.</p>

  <p>It was well known by all that the Other Shore Tokens were the source of power in the chaos.</p>

  <p>But to their surprise, Mike's grandson could modify them at will. What kind of ability was this?</p>

  <p>Joy's heart was filled with tenderness as she reminisced about the little boy who had once caused trouble in the fairy palace, who was now so incredibly powerful.</p>

  <p>"What line? What pillar? Zheng, tell him to come out of the sword!" Lorena ordered grumpily.</p>

  <p>She too knew the significance of the Other Shore Tokens and how extraordinary Geoffrey's ability was.</p>

  <p>But she couldn't accept that Zheng had let her grandson face the risks it came with all alone.</p>

  <p>"Mother, Geoffrey is not in the Lone Sword. His current state is unlike anything you are familiar with," said Zheng, trying to calm her down.</p>

  <p>"I don't care!" Lorena said, ignoring him and turning to the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, can you hear me? Come back now!"</p>

  <p>"Grandma..."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was taken aback by his grandmother's plea as he stood at the stair of the pillar.</p>

  <p>He climbed a long distance on the chain before he finally arrived at the mysterious courtyard that hung in the air.</p>

  <p>But when he got there, he discovered the courtyard was bound tightly by the massive chain and there was not even a crack to be found that he could enter through.</p>

  <p>This did not deter him. He didn't even consider turning back. He climbed up the chain from another corner of the courtyard and successfully reached a different pillar.</p>

  <p>The first pillar had all sorts of lines on it that were connected to the chaos.</p>

  <p>The second pillar, however, was bare and didn't have any light spreading out from it, including the location of the ten Holy Items at the top.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey knew the Holy Items were significant.</p>

  <p>'What if I upgrade the Lone Sword into a Holy Item?'</p>

  <p>With this idea burning within, he climbed back along the chain and returned to the eleventh stair of the pillar of the Snake Spirit Sect. When he came into contact with the light, he told the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord of his plan, but as he spoke, he discovered that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>The Lone Sword was actually in the hands of Tianming, and his father, grandmother, and grandfather were gathered around Tianming.</p>

  <p>It seemed his father had returned to the divine land.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to go back," Geoffrey revealed while playing the light.</p>

  <p>Climbing so high was not easy for him and he would definitely not give up now that he could help Tianming enhance the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord passed Geoffrey's words on to Lorena.</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows raised as she began arguing with Geoffrey, "These sort of things are not suitable for you. Geoffrey, you're still young and don't understand how dangerous the world really is..."</p>

  <p>He ignored her outright and instead said, "Uncle Tianming, let me help you strengthen your sword."</p>

  <p>He pulled the black stone out of the pillar and the link between it and the Lone Sword was broken.</p>

  <p>The Lone Sword's aura quickly dissipated without any energy reaction, leaving it looking like an ordinary iron weapon.</p>

  <p>"The Lone Sword..." The change in the sword stunned Tianming.</p>

  <p>"He has broken the link to the Lone Sword," announced the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. "Don't worry, you need only wait. He should be changing the sword's ability now."</p>

  <p>"Can you get in touch with him?" asked Lorena, still peeved.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"That brat..." Lorena muttered angrily, turning her head to stare at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You're his father. Why aren't you stopping him? I'm going to tell Tia about this and we'll see how you explain it then!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was speechless. Geoffrey hadn't even given him the chance to speak.</p>

  <p>How could he have persuaded him?</p>

  <p>"Mother, Geoffrey is not a child anymore. He can take care of himself well enough," Zheng said, still trying to calm her nerves. "Some of the members of the Nine Li race are waiting for you in the Pear Hill. Let me take you there now."</p>

  <p>Lorena was still enraged but after hearing this, she thought a while and then asked, "Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Grandpa Ambrose and Grandpa Tucker," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Take us there!" Harper came out of the divine land.</p>

  <p>He had always been loyal to the Nine Li race and was now eager to meet Ambrose and Tucker.</p>

  <p>Zheng constructed a space door which led directly to the Pear Hill and sent Lorena, Harper and Rosie through.</p>

  <p>When Ambrose and Tucker saw Lorena and Rosie, their eyes instantly turned red.</p>

  <p>Back when the divine land set sail, they were left extremely desperate.</p>

  <p>They had never imagined they'd meet again someday.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, seven of the nine chiefs had died, and those who remained of the Nine Li race were weak. It wasn't difficult to imagine their current sadness.</p>

  <p>After assisting his mother and the others in settling down in the Pear Hill, Zheng returned to the top of the divine land and described roughly what he had encountered on his travels to the Source World.</p>

  <p>He spoke of how he joined the Sword Light Palace and the Oneness Sky Palace and traveled to the Pear Hill, and how he then took the Pear Hill away from the Source World.</p>

  <p>Zheng's stories did not relieve Mike. Instead, he asked in surprise, "So the huge Source World has fallen into the hands of the Evil God, who was born in your inner world?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng answered affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"It appears the situation is even more serious than I had thought."</p>

  <p>Bromley was overtaken by a gloomy seriousness.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been silent all this time but then suddenly said to Zheng, "The Snake Spirit King must be very confident to dare to take this step. Even if the Evil God has controlled the Source World, he may not be able to handle him."</p>

  <p>Zheng had the ancestry-level bloodline, and so knew from the very beginning how to deal with this. Moreover, his primitive land was small in size, making it easy for him to manage.</p>

  <p>But the Source World was different.</p>

  <p>It had developed over countless years. It had long since grown into a gigantic world and couldn't fight against the heads given its huge form.</p>

  <p>It was just as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had guessed; the Source World was currently in the middle of an unprecedented era of suffering.</p>
