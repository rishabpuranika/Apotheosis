  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly floated in the depths of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Scarlet blood weaved and swirled among the waves. Strangely, the blood did not dissipate or dissolve into the water of the Time Sea, like oil to water.</p>

  <p>At the moment when Leyton exploded, Luo Zheng saw a faint red triangular fragment that was burning with intensity.</p>

  <p>"Is that triangular fragment his Other Shore Token?" Luo Zheng wondered aloud.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the triangular fragment, Luo Zheng felt a completely different aura, the likes of which he had never experienced before.</p>

  <p>"Yes," No. 9527 replied. "The power of warriors at the Other Shore Realm originates from such a token. You will find out what that means when you reach the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>An incredible amount of power was released when the Other Shore Token was incinerated for Leyton to self-destruct, but it was naive of him to think that he could drag Luo Zheng to die with him.</p>

  <p>To succeed in killing Luo Zheng within the confines of the divine land, one should have the ability to destroy the entire divine land. Luo Zheng had yet to meet an opponent who held that kind of power.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered for a moment and suddenly recalled that Leyton had previously mentioned the Sky Guard Pavilion and Clement.</p>

  <p>"Damn, something has happened outside the divine land!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unable to tell if Leyton's words were true, but it was obvious that he had every confidence on that Clement.</p>

  <p>If Timotheus and Emily could not deal with the situation, then the others would be placed in grave danger.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings would be fine; they could still be reborn even if they were killed. Unfortunately for his mother, she did not have a Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body vibrated slightly and disappeared from the bottom of the Time Sea. In the next moment, he appeared in front of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Estelle and Holy Jay had felt the tremors from the shore of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>They were extremely worried about Luo Zheng's safety. When he appeared before their eyes safe and sound, both of them couldn't hold back their sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the Holy Beings in the distance and remarked softly, "I want to investigate the situation in the outside world. Take care of the matters hereabouts."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay frowned and said, "But your strength..."</p>

  <p>"I will not leave the divine land," Luo Zheng rebutted the other's worried admonition with conviction.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation was at the consummate True God Realm. In terms of physical might, he was slightly stronger than Holy Beings. Even so, all of his power was tied to the divine land. If he really left the divine land, he would not be able to fight against the masters at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"Please be careful," Estelle entreated with concern.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in acknowledgment and then disappeared again. In the blink of an eye, he materialized at the top of a universe. This particular universe was the one that Murphy had built.</p>

  <p>In the past, Emily had elected to send Luo Zheng into the divine land through the Murphy Universe. Thus, Nicholas was able to sense the presence of Emily and her companions through the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>"A green star?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he saw the lone star at the top of the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>At that moment, four to five beams of light zipped past. The creatures in the Murphy Universe were probably the fake Sacred race who had invaded the Evolutionary Universe back then.</p>

  <p>"Who dares to wander around the forbidden area?"</p>

  <p>A loud, demanding voice reached Luo Zheng's ears even if the people who came up were still some distance away from him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was sure he had heard that voice before, even if the person's features were unclear to him. It sounded surprisingly familiar.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As the distance between Luo Zheng and the group of people narrowed, Luo Zheng was able to take a good look at the speaker as they approached. He saw the features of the person at the helm and immediately placed a name with the voice.</p>

  <p>"Maha?" Luo Zheng definitely did not expect to meet him here.</p>

  <p>The mention of his name took the man called Maha by surprise. For some time, he cast a curious gaze on Luo Zheng's face in an attempt to recognize the other, and then a light of recognition flashed in his eyes. "You are... You're Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, in the Sunflower Water World, Maha had singlehandedly challenged the ace talents and Godly Geniuses of the Evolutionary Universe, which had shocked the entire Evolutionary Universe. He even successfully defeated Nathan. Ultimately, however, he was slain by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even so, Maha was the young master of the fake Sacred race, and his people had made preparations beforehand in case he died. After returning to the Murphy Universe, he once again obtained a powerful form.</p>

  <p>However, after Maha was revived, the fake Sacred race had to retreat following a bitter defeat.</p>

  <p>Thus, he had extremely limited knowledge about what happened to the Evolutionary Universe from that point onward.</p>

  <p>That universe war had ended with the fall of the Murphy Universe. They had lost many Supreme Lords, leaving many vacancies for the position.</p>

  <p>However, Maha was still not conferred with the position of a Supreme Lord. He continued to cultivate wholeheartedly in the hopes that one day, he could leave the Murphy Universe and step into the divine land.</p>

  <p>Now, the Murphy Universe was in chaos. At the top of the Murphy Universe, a band of warriors at the Other Shore Realm were fighting.</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Mirror Shield separated everything, the movements of the masters at the Other Shore Realm made too much noise. Thunderous sounds often boomed throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>Maha was on a mission to inspect this area. Coincidentally, he stumbled upon Luo Zheng, who was just passing by.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's me." Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes slightly.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng, Maha did not leave a good first impression. Although it was Murphy who started the universe war and the secondary creatures of the fake Sacred race were nothing but his pawns, Maha had led the fake Sacred race to cause trouble in the Evolutionary Universe time and again.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng thought back to that time and found that some things did not bother him anymore. Now, Maha was of no consequence.</p>

  <p>Maha's thoughts ran on a different thread. Back then, he had suffered a great shame when he was defeated and killed by Luo Zheng. Although time flowed faster in the universe, his defeat had happened only two hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>He had always harbored a deep grudge against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Maha had his long spear pointed at Luo Zheng. A sneer appeared on his face as he said, "I don't know why you sneaked into the Murphy Universe, but since you're here, don't even think of making it out of here alive."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation level was currently at the consummate True God Realm, but he kept his aura in check.</p>

  <p>In the Murphy Universe, even the highest of Supreme Lords could only distinguish between low-rank and mid-rank True Gods. It was impossible for them to recognize Luo Zheng's cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Maha himself thought that Luo Zheng had only used secret techniques to conceal his cultivation and that the latter was a mere world lord.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Murphy Universe was his turf! Any altercation in the Murphy Universe would summon Holy Murphy at any time. Even if Luo Zheng was powerful, Maha sincerely doubted that he would be stronger than the Holy Being who had created this universe.</p>

  <p>Thus, Maha feared nothing.</p>

  <p>"It has been more than two hundred years, but you haven't changed at all..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tutted and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Zheng was also considered as one of the top talents. However, it was not until he stepped into the divine land that he had realized just how insignificant he had been.</p>

  <p>Maha's father was a Supreme Lord of the Murphy Universe, so Maha was naturally domineering and arrogant in his territory. However, failure to change after stepping into the divine land spelled big trouble and considerable loss for him.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could finish his words, Maha suddenly shook the spear in his hand. The spear shot towards Luo Zheng, moving like a poisonous dragon.</p>

  <p>As the spear was closing in on Luo Zheng, it only managed to move halfway to its target and no further. An invisible force had stopped it.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Murphy appeared in front of Maha. He gently held the tip of his spear with two fingertips and flashed Maha a look of cold contempt.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned his head and smiled at Luo Zheng.</p>
