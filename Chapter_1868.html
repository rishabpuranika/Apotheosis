<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Along the way, they came across few unaccompanied beasts, and all the warriors of the other races clustered together to attack them.</p>

  <p>None of the strange beasts that interacted with them were able to stay whole. They were either torn to pieces or turned into blood mist.</p>

  <p>Although the warriors were strong and powerful, they did not meet many beasts to let out their energy on. They hated it that the beasts were not enough to for them to kill.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they heard a rustling sound. One of the old foreign warriors, Theodore, instantly noticed the expressions of the Collapsing Mountain people change––especially the few people from the Divinity Hunt Squad.</p>

  <p>Theodore and the others did not rush forward. They quietly retreated backwards.</p>

  <p>However, some of the warriors felt that there was a strong beast ahead of them. These warriors rushed forward without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>To be honest, the warriors that had rushed forward were also extremely careful. Those that were too reckless wouldn't be able to obtain a purple trial tally and in return, would enter the Collapsing Mountain race to improve.</p>

  <p>They were thrilled. One, because their strength had advanced. Two, because the forest was closely connected to the Calamity Dispelling Forest. They could smell the faint scent coming from it, which strengthened the force of their bodies.</p>

  <p>"All of you retreat! That's a Martial Sacred Beast! If you touch it, your death is certain!"</p>

  <p>Although Chapman did not care about the lives of the warriors, he wouldn't send them straight to their deaths…</p>

  <p>All the Collapsing Mountain people quickly gathered together. Upon hearing Chapman's words, some of the warriors from the other races who were with quick reflexes stopped. They began to retreat.</p>

  <p>But Chapman's warning was a little too late. Not to mention these warriors had already rushed out at a great distance!</p>

  <p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh…</p>

  <p>Suddenly, gray tentacles appeared from behind the huge trees around them.</p>

  <p>As Zheng stood in the middle of the crowd and noticed the tentacles, his eyes flashed. "This Martial Sacred Beast is a puppet?"</p>

  <p>The steel tentacles were forged individually. They looked like parts of a puppet made of metal!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the tentacles––or steel ropes––lashed out, they left deep grooves in the ground. After the near warriors were hit, they were caught by steel ropes and dragged into the depths of the bushes along with a miserable scream…</p>

  <p>Two of the trapped warriors had obtained the title of, "super powerful warrior", and their strength was not weak. However, after a short struggle, they were also dragged away!</p>

  <p>Everyone who remained was pale-faced. Who would dare to stay? At this moment, many seized the opportunity to flee…</p>

  <p>But, there were too many steel ropes. Under the continuous backlash, seven or eight foreign warriors were caught.</p>

  <p>"Dragon Hunt Squad, open the Demon Sealing Array!"</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was heavy, even Chapman was extremely serious.</p>

  <p>This Martial Sacred Beast was a powerful beast that resided in the forest of giant trees. Specifically, half of this beast belonged to the living, and the other half was a puppet.</p>

  <p>There were a few things that could not be defeated in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. One of them was the Martial Sacred Beast, because it was the pet of the owner of the place. Who could ever know how many creatures it had devoured over the years!</p>

  <p>The Martial Sacred beast had no natural enemy in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Until now, the Collapsing Mountain race had never seen the true face of this creature. Earlier, this race did not dare to enter the forest of giant trees because they would surely die if they met a Martial Sacred Beast.</p>

  <p>Many people had lost their lives in the forest of giant trees. The race's prophet had taught them the use of the Demon Sealing Array. If they ever encountered a Martial Sacred Beast, they only needed to activate the Demon Sealing Array, and they wouldn't be attacked.</p>

  <p>What Chapman didn't know was that the Demon Sealing Array was not very powerful. It only contained information that was off-limits to the Martial Sacred Beast.</p>

  <p>After the prophet communicated with the master, the master granted the Demon Sealing Array to him.</p>

  <p>The Martial Sacred Beast was the spirit pet of the master. The master naturally didn't wish for the Collapsing Mountain race to be eaten by the pet…</p>

  <p>In short, as long as the Demon Sealing Array was activated, the Martial Sacred Beast would stop attacking the people and treat them as its own.</p>

  <p>For many years, the Collapsing Mountain race had been relying on the Demon Sealing Array for them to pass through the forest of giant trees.</p>

  <p>Because of the Demon Sealing Array, it was easy to pass through the forest. With this ferocious beast here, it was impossible for other beasts to survive in this forest!</p>

  <p>Over time, the Collapsing Mountain race had forgotten this "Martial Sacred Beast". But they did not expect the beast to come out today.</p>

  <p>Chapman was confused. It was still daytime, why would a Martial Sacred beast attack them?</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the men of the Dragon Hunt Squad instantly activated the divine textures. They began to link together, forming a deep blue grid that circled and enveloped the warriors from the Collapsing Mountain race and other races.</p>

  <p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh…</p>

  <p>Many steel ropes crawled over from everywhere, like small snakes made of metal, and didn't stop extending and crawling on the ground.</p>

  <p>The moment the ropes touched the grid, they retracted as if they had been electrocuted.</p>

  <p>"Chapman, what's going on?" one of the clansmen asked.</p>

  <p>As Chapman looked at the steel ropes surrounding them, he couldn't understand why the Martial Sacred Beast suddenly attacked the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>The ropes continued to climb and crawl until they came into contact with the Demon Sealing Array. After these ropes touched it, they retreated backwards in an instant…</p>

  <p>Right now, all the warriors from the other races were hiding in the grid, barely even breathing.</p>

  <p>It was only then, they remembered that this was the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. It was crowded with all kinds of powerful strange beasts.</p>

  <p>"The situation isn't right," one of the members of the Divinity Hunt Squad said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng was called the wild king––he had joined the Divinity Hunt Squad.</p>

  <p>He was equal to those in same squad, and could even go past them.</p>

  <p>"In the past, after the Demon Sealing Array was activated, the Martial Sacred Beast would stop its attack and leave… But today…" the man said as he pointed around.</p>

  <p>From the thick logs of wood, steel ropes kept extending towards them.</p>

  <p>But once they touched the array, they would retreat. However, not long after, the ropes returned––as if they didn't want to give up at all.</p>

  <p>Chapman saw this, and his expression turned ugly. "There should be something that the Martial Sacred Beast wants from us!"</p>

  <p>'Something that a Martial Sacred Beast wants?'</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered, but it ultimately landed on Liusu.</p>

  <p>Liusu was flustered as she met his gaze. She pressed her lips together.</p>

  <p>'Is it her?'</p>

  <p>Zheng guessed. He noticed that the ropes nearest Liusu were the most concentrated. However, these ropes seemed to be afraid of the array and weren't willing to break it.</p>

  <p>When he first entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, The Formless Sky Python had been chasing after this woman.</p>

  <p>Liusu was an extremely beautiful woman, but how could these strange beasts be lustful of women? Why did all the beasts willingly cause trouble… for her?</p>

  <p>As Zheng thought about it, the ropes finally could not hold themselves back and started aggressively lashing out at the Demon Sealing Array.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The array was unable to withstand the strong attacks of the Martial Sacred Beast. The only defense was its contained information that caused the beast to be fearful.</p>

  <p>But now, the array had lost its effectiveness. The Martial Sacred Beast began to wildly whip around!</p>

  <p>As the Collapsing Mountain race saw what was wrong, they turned around and ran. A gap suddenly appeared in the original array!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>One of the steel ropes took advantage of their absence.</p>

  <p>And just as Zheng had guessed, the beast's goal was Liusu.</p>

  <p>"Princess Royal, let's go!"</p>

  <p>The expressions of Kenna and his companions fell.</p>

  <p>They had originally thought that following the Collapsing Mountain race wouldn't be dangerous, but they had forgotten about Liusu. Her physique was a fatal attraction to all beasts…</p>

  <p>Liusu didn't listen. She leapt up and ran towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>She knew that Kennan's grand Wishing Spell had been put to use on the Formless Sky Python, and he couldn't use it again. It would be impossible for him to fight against this Martial Sacred Beast.</p>

  <p>And at this moment, she could only settle her hopes on Zheng.</p>
