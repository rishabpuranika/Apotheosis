<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 187 Attack Of The Demons (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The demon general continued his ascent towards the catapult. The presence of the soldier in front of him proved to be no hindrance at all. In fact, he simply waved a heavy arm and slapped his body away upon reaching him.</p>

  <p>The impact of the slap directly crushed the soldier's body which sent him flying to his death!</p>

  <p>At this point, the demon general got much closer to the firing catapult.</p>

  <p>The remaining two soldiers set up an arrow as fast as they could and fired it up at the sky. A demon bird and a demon general got hit and instantly became two balls of fire. Although the two soldiers looked calm and fearless on the outside, they clearly knew that death awaited them just like their companion.</p>

  <p>Finally, the demon general had reached the catapult. When he was about to smash the two soldiers into pieces, he suddenly felt a dangerous presence from behind him.</p>

  <p>However, when he turned around to look, the dangerous Mu Ning had vanished.</p>

  <p>He simply shrugged it off and turned his head back to the two remaining soldiers. Just as he did so, a broken flying knife came to greet him in the face!</p>

  <p>His eyes went wide for a fraction of a second as he tried to dodge the force but it turned out that it was too late. He instinctively blocked his face with his right arm, hoping his thick and leathery skin would save him from the weapon.</p>

  <p>It was only when the blade of the knife had struck his skin that the demon general realized how foolish it was to use his arm to block it. It turned out the knife was not just an ordinary knife and it was far sharper than what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>His tough and strong arm posed no resistance to the flying knife as it passed through his limb, slicing right down in the middle.</p>

  <p>The knife's blade was able to cut through the arm muscle and went straight to his head.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The demon general's hideous head was cut into two by the flying knife as it fell to the floor with a dull thud. His eyes remained bulbous and bulged even in his last moments, which showed just how shocked and in disbelief he was at his death.</p>

  <p>The broken knife was drawn back by Luo Zheng, whose lips curved into a satisfied smile. He nodded in friendship at the two frightened soldiers.</p>

  <p>The two soldiers who had just narrowly escaped death, smiled back at Luo Zheng in return, their eyes full of gratitude. If it wasn't for Zheng's timely appearance, they would've joined the other soldier in death by now.</p>

  <p>The other disciples of Cloud Sect had also joined Luo Zheng and the imperial army to battle the demons. Their limited numbers and strength obviously prevented them from provoking the demon generals, but they were fully capable of dealing damage to the demon soldiers.</p>

  <p>After the first wave of their siege, the demon army hastily called for retreat. Even though this was only a minor engagement, they had lost many demons already. This did not gain them the upper hand or any advantage in the battle.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, White Emperor City only lost a few dozen firing catapults and some ordinary soldiers. This made them lucky enough to fare much better than the demon forces.</p>

  <p>It was true that they had beaten today's siege of the demon army. Despite this, it was clear that worry still lingered in everyone's hearts.</p>

  <p>It was highly probable that the concluded siege would call the attention of the rest of White Emperor City's forces, which meant that the demons might storm the city at a much larger scale on a later time.</p>

  <p>"We must leave White Emperor City as soon as possible!" an anxious voice sounded. It was proposed by one of Cloud Sect's disciples the moment they returned to the camp.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this was only a small assault. If the demons mount a general offensive, the strong refiners in White Emperor City will have no time to even care about us," said another disciple.</p>

  <p>The two disciples had a point. It was human nature to seek out the good and avoid the bad.</p>

  <p>Since they weren't from the imperial army, they had no obligations to stay in White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>It was true that White Emperor City had been impregnable for many years, and no forces were able to overcome its marvelous defenses and strength.</p>

  <p>However, when the demons' attack had besieged them, the disciples did not even have a place to hide. This scenario would certainly be driven to a dead end.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't there a letter back from the sect saying that an enormous flying chariot will be sent to pick us up soon?" one disciple piped up. The rest of them looked at each other in thought.</p>

  <p>"Who knows? Maybe that chariot couldn't come because of the attack," another disciple speculated. A small lapse of silence enveloped the air.</p>

  <p>It proved to be that the man was right in his assumption.</p>

  <p>It was true that the enormous flying chariot which was supposed to take them back wasn't able to come because of the demons' offensive attacks.</p>

  <p>Since the earlier fall of the Heaven and Earth towers, a group of demon birds that carried a handful of demon soldiers and generals in their talons had circled the rear part of White Emperor City and attacked any forces that defended or visited the area.</p>

  <p>In fact, Cloud Sect had already sent two enormous flying chariots.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the first chariot was besieged by the demon birds in the rear area making it crash. Meanwhile, the second one was intercepted halfway.</p>

  <p>It definitely cost a lot to build a huge flying chariot. After the loss of the two previous chariots, Cloud Sect decided to stop sending more. Instead, they planned to keep the disciples in White Emperor City until the demons withdrew.</p>

  <p>"Even if no one will come to pick us up, we can go back by ourselves.</p>

  <p>We just have to avoid those demons. Don't you think so?" one disciple suggested. Majority of them agreed and quickly accepted this proposal.</p>

  <p>Since no chariot would come pick them up anyway, they might as well take the disciple's suggestion and escape by themselves.</p>

  <p>The disciples from Cloud Sect played no major role in the war.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, once the demons launched a full-scale invasion of White Emperor City, the imperial army would never arrange for any form of protection for them.</p>

  <p>If only one or two demon generals landed near them, Lenard and Luo Zheng could handle it.</p>

  <p>However, if they were attacked by legions of demon generals, who among them could defeat such a massive force?</p>

  <p>It would be even worse if they were to face off a demon king, who could undoubtedly kill them in a second! In short, the disciples were too weak and incapable to fight in the war by themselves.</p>

  <p>Just as they were in the heat of their discussion, the loud clanking of footsteps was heard through the other side of the camp's door.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be a squad line from the imperial army.</p>

  <p>The barrack door suddenly burst open, showing a general dressed in the imperial army's uniform. "All the disciples from Cloud Sect are allowed to leave except Luo Zheng!" the general announced in a loud, authoritative voice.</p>
