<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had figured it out!</p>

  <p>"These creatures can't see anything. They can only chase after the life energy..." As she spoke, she applied a layer of Ghost Powder on her hand.</p>

  <p>The white-haired monster that had been chasing her immediately stopped in its tracks. Confused, it began to sniff and search around.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed as her mind raced. "The races on the island all know how to use the Ghost Powder, which means the white-haired monsters should not be a threat to them. The Wooden Leaf race are willing to offer their prey to the white-haired monsters, so there must be some sort of exchange. What do they get out of this? How do they benefit?"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to guess." Luo Zheng shook his head. "Maybe after offering their prey, they can go somewhere to receive the so-called 'benefits'."</p>

  <p>There were too many possibilities, and it was difficult to deduce with extremely limited clues.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! By the way, when I used the heavenly eye to observe the Grass Bulls, the white-haired monster swallowed a Grass Bull and left some transparent glazed crystals," King Ieuan suddenly reminded.</p>

  <p>Just now, it was busy applying the Ghost Powder, so it failed to share this.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess immediately looked at Pearson and asked, "Pearson, do you have any more Grass Bull in your spirit beast bag?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Pearson nodded, understanding immediately. Without hesitation, he took out a Grass Bull from the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>Having been summoned into the world, the Grass Bull felt the strange aura from the white-haired monster. It was immediately frightened and wanted to run away.</p>

  <p>But before it could do so, Pearson pointed at its head. With a loud thud, the Grass Bull fell to the ground, in a deep coma.</p>

  <p>The white-haired monster was about to leave, but when it felt the life energy of the Grass Bull, it immediately turned around and pounced on it.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, it had devoured almost all of the Grass Bull's flesh. When it was done eating, it disintegrated into a pile of white hairs and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Ding, ding, ding...</p>

  <p>As the pile of white hairs disappeared, several glazed crystals fell to the ground with crisp sounds.</p>

  <p>These crystals were thin and long, like glass needles.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stepped forward and picked up the crystals one by one.</p>

  <p>She placed them in her hands and looked at them carefully. These crystals gave her a feeling of discomfort, as if they were a part of the Treacherous Being, and their aura was similar.</p>

  <p>"This should be what the Wooden Leaf race is after. If we are devoured, they will get a lot more crystals," the Snake Goddess said as she handed the crystals to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Fuxi held the crystals close to his face and he sniffed them carefully. After studying them in his hand for a bit, he shrugged helplessly. He couldn't shed any more light on the matter. He handed them over to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who then handed them over to Ying.</p>

  <p>Each of them took turns to observe the crystals, and finally they landed with Luo Zheng. As Luo Zheng studied them carefully, Campbell beside him asked, "Can I have a look?"</p>

  <p>Campbell had the body of the Treacherous Being, so his perception was completely different from theirs'.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and gave them to him. Then, Campbell clenched his fist, crystals in hand. Slowly, he closed his eyes and stood still.</p>

  <p>Campbell's face suddenly began to melt, like wax off a candle. His human body quickly melted into a pool of white and translucent mud, and his armor was clattered all over the ground.</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell!" Luo Zheng shouted in a hurry.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>"Why is this happening?"</p>

  <p>"Are these glazed crystals used to deal with the Treacherous Beings?"</p>

  <p>Anxiety was written all over the faces of the others.</p>

  <p>Although Campbell was only a hostility-level Treacherous Being, he was still the builder of the world!</p>

  <p>His understanding of the entire chaos far surpassed that of the others. He was indispensable to the group.</p>

  <p>If something went wrong because of a few unknown glazed crystals...</p>

  <p>"Look, those glazed crystals!" King Ieuan said as it pointed at Campbell.</p>

  <p>The previous few glazed crystals had drilled into Campbell's body and were completely wrapped up.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see. Maybe the situation is not as bad as we think," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>After all, Campbell's Treacherous Being body only melted, but it hadn't eroded. The body of the Treacherous Being was deathless after all, and as long as it could recover, it would be fine.</p>

  <p>About fifteen minutes later, the mud formed by Campbell began to shake. A head slowly emerged out of the transparent white mud, and his body slowly returned to the human form.</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell, what happened to you just now?" Luo Zheng asked, his forehead creasing with worry.</p>

  <p>Campbell opened his clenched fist, and the glazed crystals were still in his hand. Eyeing them fondly, he said, "These things seem to be my home. I feel comfortable and want to sleep in them..."</p>

  <p>As a unique creature, the Treacherous Being was naturally completely different from a normal creature.</p>

  <p>When Campbell held these crystals, he felt sleepy, as if these crystals were a bed beckoning for him.</p>

  <p>As soon as he turned into the mud, he took a short nap.</p>

  <p>After Campbell returned the crystals to Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng relayed to the others what Campbell had just told him.</p>

  <p>"Sleep..." Eastern Emperor Taiyi frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Sleep was something that weak creatures needed.</p>

  <p>A soul which had been tempered would never have the need to sleep.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the Treacherous Being possessed a more powerful and special soul. However, just now, Campbell had taken a nap! This confused Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"Maybe this kind of thing can hypnotize the Treacherous Being," Thurston guessed, gesturing at the crystals.</p>

  <p>Staring at the glazed crystals in Luo Zheng's hand, the Snake Goddess frowned deeply. "Master Campbell has woken up, but he is still unable to resist the crystals. What would happen to the Treacherous Beings which haven't woken up, if they are exposed to such crystals?"</p>

  <p>No matter they belonged to the attaching type or the killing type, these Treacherous Beings all relied on their wills to act, without too much judgment.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't these Treacherous Beings fall into a coma if they came into contact with these crystals?</p>

  <p>"Maybe they can be used to trap the Treacherous Beings," Pearson said.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded slightly, but her eyebrows still furrowed. She felt that these glazed crystals were more useful than they were letting on.</p>

  <p>"We don't have to think too much. The mystery will solve itself at dawn,"</p>

  <p>Sawyer suddenly said.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess heard this, her mouth twitched upwards into a smile. "You're right!"</p>

  <p>They weren't ruthless and merciless, but the members of the Wooden Leaf race couldn't blame them for anything they did, as they even dared to trap them and sacrifice their lives.</p>

  <p>The night of the Night View Island lasted for twenty hours.</p>

  <p>After they applied the Ghost Powder, no other white-haired monsters broke into the cave that night.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan once again took out the heavenly eye from the spirit beast bag and observed the situation outside.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, it heard the screams of some creatures. When it looked into the direction where the sound rang out, it could see the white-haired monsters devouring some unfortunate sacrifices.</p>

  <p>Twenty hours later, dawn broke, and the sky gradually lightened.</p>

  <p>As the sun rose, so did everyone's downtrodden spirits.</p>

  <p>In a small cave at the bottom of the mountain, Decker came out and shook off the Ghost Powder on his body.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Wooden Leaf race also came out of their small 'houses', including their leader, Graham.</p>

  <p>Decker and Graham locked eyes, excitement written all over their faces.</p>
