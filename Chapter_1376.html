<br/><br/>

  

  <p>In the Enchanted Barrier Tower, the 3, 000th mile was a huge hurdle.</p>

  <p>In the first tier, not a single warrior was eliminated. But in the second tier, 70% of the warriors were eliminated.</p>

  <p>As for the third tier of warriors, they were even more desperate. 90% of them had been eliminated, and only 300 out of the 3, 000 warriors had passed this stage.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors who had covered 3, 000 miles were already very proud of themselves. The alliance would invest more resources to train them. As for the reward of a secondary first-rank divine weapon, it was simply insignificant in their eyes.</p>

  <p>After 3, 000 miles, the warriors in all the tiers had slowed down greatly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, maintained his own speed.</p>

  <p>If people had been paying full attention to him, they would've known that his speed hadn't changed at all since the beginning.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he still hadn't used life vitality to protect his body. He only relied on his own strength and body as he faced the vicious Law Storm.</p>

  <p>Only Yolande had been watching Luo Zheng from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for someone else to take notice too.</p>

  <p>As the old man in cotton clothes was looking at the warriors in the first tier, he looked back and discovered something wrong with the second tier.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" The old man's eyes lit up. "This young man isn't using his life vitality to protect himself!"</p>

  <p>When he looked over, his expression froze. "Isn't that the guy who was late? Wasn't he at the tail? When did he catch up with the second tier?</p>

  <p>And he even went over 3, 000 miles."</p>

  <p>3, 000 miles wasn't much of an accomplishment to the old man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't exactly perform the best before, so the old man had completely forgotten about him. If it wasn't for the fact that Luo Zheng wasn't using his life vitality, the old man probably wouldn't have noticed him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng, who had been lugging around in last place, was now suddenly catching up. It was as if he had been teleported. Naturally, the old man was surprised.</p>

  <p>"Is this the same guy who was in the last place and refused to use life vitality to protect himself?" asked another palace leader.</p>

  <p>"That's him! How interesting! I didn't expect him to catch up to the front of the second tier."</p>

  <p>"It's a bit strange. He has covered 3, 000 miles, but still hasn't used his life vitality to protect himself. He's very confident in his own strength!"</p>

  <p>"There are a lot of interesting people in the Mist Palace right now. Layla aside, even the one who's in the second place is from the Mist Palace."</p>

  <p>The rest of the palace leaders turned their attention towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I would like to see if this guy has any plans on using his life vitality to protect himself."</p>

  <p>The truth was that using life vitality was only a method for warriors to protect themselves. This method might be considered useful within 3, 000 miles, but it wasn't that useful after 3, 000 miles. Warriors cultivating some special cultivation methods were an exception, such as those cultivating Earth Law.</p>

  <p id="top_18">"Look at his speed! He's a lot faster than the other warriors. He's going to catch up to the first tier soon enough."</p>

  <p>"Wow! He's truly something."</p>

  <p>Upon the old man mentioning Luo Zheng, the rest of the palace leaders started talking about him. While everyone was surprised by his performance, they were still a bit skeptical.</p>

  <p>As the warriors moved forward, besides strength, they also had to rely on their own comprehension and ability to deal with enemies.</p>

  <p>Warriors that could safely cross 3, 000 miles all had their own secret weapons. But even so, the speed at which they were being eliminated was still increasing.</p>

  <p>No one from the first tier had been eliminated when they reached the 4, 000th mile while half of the second tier had been eliminated, and two thirds of the third tier had been eliminated.</p>

  <p>5, 000 miles...</p>

  <p>6, 000 miles...</p>

  <p>7.000 miles...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already surpassed the second tier and caught up to the last person in the first tier.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Law Storm had risen to yet another level.</p>

  <p>Ice spears, wind blades, earth spikes, time cages, and other such weapons occasionally appeared before, but now, they were everywhere.</p>

  <p>Warriors gave their everything to fight these obstacles and Luo Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, countless spikes appeared on the ground. Although these spikes were formed from rock, the surface was gold in color. The sharpness of these spikes was comparable to a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure was like a shuttle fish as he continuously swam between the spikes. The moment he dodged the spikes, countless ice thorns burst out from them and completely sealed off his entire body.</p>

  <p>After a while, the ground was suddenly shaking and all the ice thorns were shattered by some huge force. Zheng's lean figure appeared again and continued moving forward at his pace.</p>

  <p>"This guy really has some skills!"</p>

  <p>"His strength is amazing and his body seems strong too!"</p>

  <p>"With his strength, he can enter the first tier!"</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had caught up to the first tier, it naturally attracted the attention of some of the palace leaders. As for Yolande, she still looked stoic. This still wasn't Zheng's full strength yet. She would reserve her energy for that.</p>

  <p>At the 8, 000th mile, a warrior from the first tier was finally eliminated.</p>

  <p>At this time, there were less than 10 warriors left in the second tier. As for the third tier, they were completely eliminated. No one reached the 8, 000-mile mark.</p>

  <p>Right now, the warriors that had been eliminated had returned to the square. After being eliminated, they could only become spectators.</p>

  <p>Layla was definitely leading in first place. Most of the remaining 30 plus warriors had just passed 8, 000 miles, but Layla had already reached the 9, 500th mile. She would cross 10, 000 miles in no time.</p>

  <p>When she reached the 9, 800th mile, she turned her head to look at the boundless Law Storm and murmured, "Luo Zheng, you can't possibly be eliminated now, right? If you're eliminated, you won't be qualified to be my opponent anymore."</p>

  <p>After speaking, she once again turned her head. The pair of green wings on her back lightly flapped as she rapidly shuttled forward amidst the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>"The first warrior who has passed 10, 000 miles is Layla Ai from the Mist Palace!" the old man's voice came as she passed 10, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>The warriors on the plaza were also discussing among themselves.</p>

  <p>"10, 000 miles! She has already passed 10, 000 miles!"</p>

  <p>"Didn't he say that once someone crossed 10, 000 miles, he would announce the reward for it? Why isn't he announcing it yet?"</p>

  <p>"She's too strong! How can a woman defeat so many men?"</p>

  <p>The old man continued to announce, "Warriors that have reached the 10, 000th mile will be able to obtain a Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill!"</p>

  <p>As the old man finished speaking, the warriors that were standing on the square began to discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>"The Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill!"</p>

  <p>"What? That's amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! If I had known, I would have fought with all my might."</p>

  <p>The Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill was able to introduce the Heavenly Tribulation. It had the similar function of the Tribulation Flower that Luo Zheng had swallowed on the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>The Tribulation Flower could increase the number of Heavenly Tribulations to nine.</p>

  <p>There were many warriors in the Upper World that didn't need to swallow a Tribulation Flower. With their talent, they would eventually anger the heavens. Naturally, they would have to face countless calamities. Talents in the Upper World all had to face nine Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>If a warrior entered the Soul Sea Realm with the cultivation of the eighth grade of the Life and Death Realm, then he or she would not be qualified to be called a talent.</p>

  <p>The Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill was very rare. Even though the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill and the Tribulation Exterminating Pill were both pills related to Heavenly Tribulation, the two couldn't be mentioned in the same breath.</p>

  <p>The Tribulation Exterminating Pill was only a seventh grade pill, while the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill was a ninth grade pill.</p>

  <p>The most important thing was that this pill could help a warrior trigger the tenth Heavenly Tribulation, which was also called the Perfection Tribulation. This was because after the tenth Heavenly Tribulation, a warrior's foundation would then go into a perfect state which, of course, was important to a warrior.</p>

  <p>Layla pursed her lips and continued moving forward.</p>

  <p>After she had passed 10, 000 miles, Javier was right after her. However, there were two deep holes with blood in his legs and his clothes were torn apart. He looked rather miserable.</p>
