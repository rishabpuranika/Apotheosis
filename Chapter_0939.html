<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng couldn't use the forceful energy and life vitality in this place, he could still rely on the power of the dragon scales inside his body.</p>

  <p>He had only used the power of over a hundred dragon scales, but the force of the huge vibration had instantly killed all the Murderous Rats that were attached to him!</p>

  <p>For Esther, Fabian, and some of the others, these Murderous Rats might have been troublesome to deal with. But for Luo Zheng, they hadn't even been a threat. They couldn't cause him any harm.</p>

  <p>Facing this group of Murderous Rats, everyone fought valiantly as they walked forward, forcefully slashing a path painted by blood.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the sound of banging drums suddenly came from the distant wilderness.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang...</p>

  <p>When the drumming sound began to ring out, Luo Zheng and the others heard a squeaking noise.</p>

  <p>As the noise echoed in the air, all the Murderous Rats that were charging toward Luo Zheng and the others suddenly dispersed, fleeing in all directions.</p>

  <p>They crawled into the ground and disappeared in an instant!</p>

  <p>"That squeaking sound might be from the king of these Murderous Rats,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said as he looked at the corpses of the Murderous Rats scattered around on the ground behind him like a long, dark line trailing behind.</p>

  <p>Moments later, dozens of black shadows rushed toward Luo Zheng from the sky above the wilderness.</p>

  <p>From this distance, the other warriors with Luo Zheng weren't able to see what they were clearly. A green film of light appeared over Zheng's eyes. His brows knitted together as he discerned the shadowy figures using his magic vision.</p>

  <p>"These things are able to fly in the air!"</p>

  <p>The creatures flying in the air were neither humans nor ogres, much less members of the Demon Night. Luo Zheng had never seen such creatures before.</p>

  <p>They were covered in a layer of green scales and all held a long spear in their hands. In an instant, they surrounded the group of warriors.</p>

  <p>The creature in the lead glanced at the group of warriors before raising his long spear in the air and staring at Luo Zheng from above. He uttered words in a strange language that none of the warriors had heard before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others looked at one another with confusion written all over their faces. They didn't dare to make a move.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that in this small world where life vitality and forceful energy were forbidden, there might exist other cultivation methods that Luo Zheng and the others were unaware of.</p>

  <p>"What are they?" Fabian asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>Esther shook her head. "Perhaps they're the aboriginals of this world."</p>

  <p>"What should we do now? It seems that... they want to attack us," Malcom said in a muffled voice. Just now, he had suffered a lot of attacks from the Murderous Rats. From the moment he'd entered into the Mad Scorpion's body, he had been constantly suffering setbacks!</p>

  <p>"Why should we feel afraid? If they dare to attack us, we'll fight them to the death!" Rehaan glared at the creatures in the sky as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, everyone immediately stared at Rehaan as though they were looking at an idiot.</p>

  <p>These creatures didn't seem to be very strong in terms of cultivation level, but their cultivation systems were completely different. The truth was, the warriors had no idea what the strength level of these creatures was, but the mere fact that they could fly in the sky already left the warriors at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the green-skinned creature in the lead suddenly stopped speaking. He raised his big ears and listened carefully for a while.</p>

  <p>Everyone wondered what the green-skinned creature was doing. Then, they saw him brandishing his spear toward the ground. A wave of formless energy burst out from his spear and tore the ground apart!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A ten-feet wide crack instantly appeared on the ground. As the crack extended into the distance and reached the end of this place, there was a violent explosion.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The impact of the explosion immediately flung dirt up into the air. From the crack, a brownish-yellow Murderous Rat shot out.</p>

  <p>Joy appeared on the face of the green-skinned creature when he saw the Murderous Rat. He instantly rushed toward the Murderous Rat and grabbed it firmly in his hand. No matter how much the Murderous Rat wriggled and struggled in his hand, it wasn't able to break free of his grasp.</p>

  <p>"This Murderous Rat is probably the king of the group of Murderous Rats that attacked us," Luo Zheng said with furrowed eyebrows as he watched the green-skinned creature seize the rat king in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. And this Murderous Rat king probably ordered the other Murderous Rats to attack us," Fabian said, nodding.</p>

  <p>But right now, their focus wasn't on the Murderous Rat king but on the green-skinned creature. His astonishing demonstration of power shocked everyone.</p>

  <p>If they could all still use their life vitality, or even their forceful energy, then every single one of them could easily achieve what the green-skinned creature had done. It wouldn't be difficult for them to launch a strike ten times stronger than that.</p>

  <p>But in this situation where they couldn't use their life vitality, even Esther and Fabian couldn't do what the green-skinned creature had done. It was only after witnessing this scene that Rehaan realized how naive he had been to think of fighting with the green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also silent and grim-faced. Even though he couldn't use his life vitality and forceful energy, he still had his own tough body and brute force to rely on. If he had to fight with these green-skinned creatures, he'd still have a chance of winning. His only worry was that this group of green-skinned creatures were merely the vanguard and that there might be more powerful ones to come.</p>

  <p>After the green-skinned creature caught the Murderous Rat king, he started chatting with the other green-skinned creatures. When they finished their conversation, they looked at the group of warriors with a murderous expression.</p>

  <p>Of course, all the warriors noticed the murderous expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>They all immediately understood that they were going to fight. They weren't timid warriors who would just stand there and wait for their deaths.</p>

  <p>When it was time to fight, they would go all out without the slightest bit of hesitation. All of them turned vigilant.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, his hand was ready on his space ring. The moment the opponents made a move, he would take out the broken flying knife from his space ring. He was confident that even if he used brute force to shoot the flying knife, he could instantly kill one or two green-skinned creatures!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Yolande raised her head and murmured something in an unknown language.</p>

  <p>Everyone was shocked when they heard the words that came out of Yolande's mouth. They'd never imagined that one of them would be able to speak the language of these green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures were equally astonished to hear Yolande's words. They exchanged puzzled glances with one another before one of them turned to Yolande and replied in their language.</p>

  <p>Yolande spoke again, but this time, she seemed to be arguing with the green-skinned creature about something.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creature who was speaking to Yolande went silent for a while. Then, he took out a large net from his back and threw it toward the group.</p>

  <p>Everyone was about to rush away to avoid getting caught in the net when they heard Yolande say, "Don't move!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Esther asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>They were all getting more and more impatient with Yolande. She kept putting them in increasingly dangerous situations.</p>

  <p>"I've persuaded them not to kill us, but they want to keep us as captives,"</p>

  <p>Yolande replied.</p>

  <p>"But what will happen after they capture us?" Fabian asked.</p>

  <p>By then, they were all already trapped inside the large net.</p>

  <p>However, even though this large net had trapped Luo Zheng and the others, it couldn't trap Xun. She easily escaped from the net.</p>

  <p>One of the green-skinned creatures pointed at Xun and said something.</p>

  <p>Xun blinked her eyes. She was short-tempered and didn't hesitate to raise her spear at them. But before she could attack, Yolande said,</p>

  <p>"Xun, stop."</p>

  <p>"Why? I don't have to listen to you." Xun hadn't liked Yolande from the start, so she didn't want to listen to her now.</p>

  <p>"If you want Luo Zheng to leave this place safe and sound, you must listen to me,"</p>

  <p>Yolande said firmly.</p>

  <p>The moment Xun heard this, she immediately paused. Of course she didn't want Luo Zheng to be trapped here for the rest of his life. In the end, she threw the long spear into the space ring that hung on Zheng's chest. Then, she turned into a dot of red light and whirled into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>This had caught the attention of the green-skinned creatures. They were all staring greedily at the space ring on Zheng's chest. However, they didn't move toward it.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures in the sky each pulled a rope and lifted up the large net. All the warriors were dragged up into the air. This large net seemed to be woven with special golden silk which couldn't be damaged by an ordinary sword. And given that everyone was tightly bound by the large net, it was almost impossible for them to break free.</p>

  <p>"Now that they're taking us back to their lair, we're completely at their mercy. They can kill us whenever they want!" Jarrod exclaimed angrily.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, you said that you had a way to get us out of the fog, so what's this? We're doomed now," Esther added.</p>

  <p>Malcom remained silent. Yolander had broken his arm earlier, so he didn't dare to say anything now.</p>

  <p>Yolande sneered. "You were trapped in the fog and you would eventually be pulled into the abyss by the Fog Array. Without me, you would have already died."</p>

  <p>No one dared to utter a sound hearing this.</p>
