<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 134 An Unavoidable Encounter (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The thin, misty wisps of clouds swirled around the light blue sky like steam from a hot spring as a little pebble crashed down about a thousand feet to the earth.</p>

  <p>As the forces of gravity sucked it in, the pebble first hit the rocky mountainsides before finally landing with a loud "crack" on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was deep in thought about Yan's whereabouts as he stood outdoors when the crack of the pebble landing stunned him.</p>

  <p>He had been walking around the mountainside before in circles and had almost searched every part of the mountain, but to no avail. He couldn't find a single trace of Yan.</p>

  <p>He paused momentarily. 'Where on earth is she?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up at the summit over him, his eyebrows tightly knitted in confusion.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be that Yan was trapped in a higher place, was she?</p>

  <p>After thinking more about Yan's whereabouts, Luo Zheng resumed climbing up.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng ascended up the mountain's rocky slopes, several people were walking down along the path leading to the summit.</p>

  <p>The handsome, noble looking man walking at the helm of the group wore deep purple robes. Although it was quite dark, a faint light seemed to emanate from his being.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to observe. A far as he knew, disciples of Cloud Sect generally wore clothes in three colors.</p>

  <p>It was common knowledge that the outer disciples were dressed in white robes, while inner disciples wore black robes.</p>

  <p>However, some disciples were dressed in purple robes.</p>

  <p>In Cloud Sect, disciples who wore purple robes were guided by their masters personally and they directly acquired refinement skills from their maters. Inside this sect, still only quite a few disciples wore purple robes, which symbolized a superior position.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes focused on the man wearing purple robes. "This person has 'intent' as well!" Luo Zheng muttered to himself. "It's the homicidal intent of lotus!" he concluded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng further observed that the man was shrouded by a band of lotus-shaped light behind him. The "homicidal intent of lotus" that clouded his body was quite mild like a tangle of soft, worn-out thorns that no longer scared and hurt people.</p>

  <p>This "homicidal intent of lotus" was also known as certain temperament or nature.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng still perceived some sort of threat in that seemingly mild and tame "homicidal intent of lotus." It was said that the power of this intent would be extremely hard to resist once it was brought into play. A strong temptation, one might say.</p>

  <p>When the group was nearly approaching him, Luo Zheng prepared to move out of their sight.</p>

  <p>However, when he moved sideways, Luo Zheng noticed two men out of the corner of his eye that he was familiar with. He recognized them as Perrin and Billy, and they were walking behind the man dressed in the purple robes.</p>

  <p>"Perrin, where is Yan?" Zheng's eyebrows shot up as he questioned Perrin while he got down from where he was perched, and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Perrin was a little surprised to hear a voice echoing out loudly, calling his name. He turned around and saw Luo Zheng who was ahead. He sneered at him and said, "Luo Zheng, what a coincidence to meet you here. I have originally planned to extend your freedom for a few more days but I never expected you to even dare show up here at Hell Mountain." Perrin's life vitality was invigorated as he spoke to Luo Zheng. It was evident that he wanted to hit him directly.</p>

  <p>"Perrin, who is he?" Vale Wang asked as he causally glanced at Luo Zheng. It was known that Vale held a prominent status and strength, so it didn't matter to him who Luo Zheng was at all. He only asked Perrin about his identity since he mentioned Yan, a woman he loved.</p>

  <p>Perrin was momentarily dazed by the question. He was stunned in silence as he struggled to find an answer. Beads of sweat formed near his brow and he stammered, "He...he is an unfilial member of our Luo family."</p>

  <p>"I am asking you where Yan is! Tell me!" Luo Zheng suddenly bellowed in anger, his eyebrows furrowing even more as he walked closer to Perrin.</p>

  <p>Vale's perfectly shaped brows furrowed as he questioned Luo Zheng back in a low voice, "Who are you? What's your relationship with Yan? Why are you looking for her?"</p>

  <p>"Yan is my little sister. I naturally have to know where she is," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Now that he knew they were siblings, Vale forced a polite and gentle smile on his face. Prior to this meeting, Yan had briefly mentioned that she had a biological brother, and she cared a great deal about him.</p>

  <p>After thinking about this, he asked Perrin, "Is Yan's brother an outer disciple of Cloud Sect? You've never told me about this before."</p>

  <p>The beads of sweat on Perrin's forehead multiplied even though Vale asked him in a calm voice.</p>

  <p>The Wang Family was powerful and certainly had great influence. Perrin couldn't have been even connected with the clan if it hadn't been for Yan.</p>

  <p>Yan's generosity towards Perrin paved the way for him to get acquainted with the Wang family. Afterwards, he had not only easily become an inner disciple of the Cloud Sect, but also reached a higher level with the help of the Wang family's "refinement chamber" and several grade-4 enhancement pills. All of these made his skills improve so much over only a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Perrin could not tell Vale that Yan's biological brother had joined Cloud Sect too, or else all the golden opportunities to acquire more refinement skills, learn courtesy of the Wang family and gain support from the family members would be lost.</p>

  <p>If everything would work out in his favor, Perrin would've even planned to execute Luo Zheng first before anyone could question him, but his plan failed terribly.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is an unfilial member of our clan and because of that, all of us expect to kill him, so I never mentioned him in front of you," explained Perrin.</p>

  <p>However, Vale wasn't interested in the Luo family's disputes at all. He only knew that Yan cared a lot about her biological brother. In that case, he civilly bowed to Luo Zheng and properly introduced himself, "I am Vale Wang, directly apprenticed to a presbyter of Cloud Sect."</p>

  <p>To see Vale bow in front of him, Perrin and Billy were amazed and stood still in astonishment at the scene in front of them.</p>

  <p>Not only them, but Luo Zheng likewise was a bit shocked that someone like Vale even bowed to him, when he himself was only an outer disciple.</p>

  <p>This was really beyond his wildest imaginations that Luo Zheng thought what the hell was Vale thinking or even plotting. In any case, he politely responded back, "I am  Luo Zheng Luo, an outer disciple of Drizzle Peak."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, I have heard your name many times. Yan often mentions you in front of me. She misses you very much," after saying this, Vale even made another bow to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Vale was one of the most outstanding members of Cloud Sect. Only a very select few people could win such great respect from him, much less a bow. However just now, he had bowed to Luo Zheng two times already.</p>

  <p>The scene in front of them made the sweat on Perrin's forehead intensified. His back started feeling the same as well.</p>

  <p>Seeing how Vale was so polite to him, Luo Zheng got more curious and so he asked, "It is the first time that we meet. Why do you treat me so politely?"</p>

  <p>Once again, Vale shocked everyone with another unexpected bow before he answered back with a polite smile, "I am so lucky to have gotten acquainted with Yan. You will be my brother-in-law if I have the chance to marry her."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was quite infuriated upon hearing these words. Only just now he had realized why Vale bothered to be so polite to him. His eyebrows shot up to his forehead when Vale rashly mentioned marrying his little sister. He snorted, "You? Marrying Yan? That's crazy! You are just dreaming! You are not good enough for my little sister whatever your Wang family is."</p>

  <p>In Zheng's heart, Yan was his only family member in the world. It angered him to hear Vale say those words in such a rash and frivolous manner especially that it was the first time that they met. Luo Zheng really could not tolerate a man with that kind of imprudent behavior.</p>

  <p>People are reluctant to hit one who is very polite in spite of great anger, as the saying goes. However, Luo Zheng made one exception. In spite of Vale treating him so politely, Luo Zheng fired back coldly without hesitation.</p>
