<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The last time she entered the Soul City, Li Bianxue had risen to a height of six hundred and twenty feet.</p>

  <p>It was only her sixteenth time entering the Soul City, so being able to reach such a height was a big deal in the city. There were very few people like her, at least in the Source World. Naturally, she attracted a lot of attention in the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue's rising speed was far from Toby's. She was careful the entire time, rising at a constant speed. Within five minutes, she had risen over a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, she was at six hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Zhu Ge Feng, Carver, and the rest paid close attention to Li Bianxue, nervously watching her soul pillar.</p>

  <p>"This time, she may rise to a height of over seven hundred feet!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe she can break the Taiyi Heaven Palace's record!"</p>

  <p id="top_23">"Look, she's broken her last record!"</p>

  <p>After reaching the height of six hundred and twenty feet, Li Bianxue continued to rise. While she was somewhat slowing down, she still rose steadily and constantly.</p>

  <p>When the soul pillar reached a height of seven hundred feet, it finally came to a stop.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A shadow descended from the soul cloud quickly, steadily landing on the ground.</p>

  <p>Just as Li Bianxue had said to Luo Zheng, she never forced herself in the soul cloud. It was only natural that she wasn't as miserable as Toby when she landed.</p>

  <p>"Li Bianxue, you've reached a height of seven hundred feet at the seventeenth attempt. You truly are the pride of our Taiyi Heaven Palace!" praised Zhu Ge Feng.</p>

  <p>"I'm flattered," Li Bianxue said flatly.</p>

  <p>After all, she never gave much importance to the records; otherwise, she could have pushed her abilities further.</p>

  <p>Just as the people of the Land of Sword Grief complimented her, an emotionless voice came from nearby. "The Taiyi Heaven Palace is proud of seven hundred feet? Interesting."</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to the source of the voice. Standing on the soul pillar was a human Soul of Light. The soul pillar displayed the number eleven.</p>

  <p>This indicated that the person had entered the Soul City eleven times.</p>

  <p>"It's Dailey Ji from the Bearing race!"</p>

  <p>"He is said to be the strongest talent of the Bearing race since its beginnings, someone with talent greater than the Xuanyuan's!"</p>

  <p>"It's said that the first time he entered the Soul City, he had risen to a height of seven hundred and ninety feet. At his tenth time, he's already reached nine hundred and fifty feet."</p>

  <p>Regardless of what race they belonged to, so long as they were geniuses, they'd always attract much attention.</p>

  <p>Dailey's words immediately attracted the Souls of Light's attention. He was the topic of conversation for both the human race and the other races in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"What's the big deal? You haven't even reached a thousand feet yet. Even if you reach nine hundred and ninety feet, it's no different from ten. Before daring to mock it, you must go through the Soul City first," Zhu Ge Feng retorted coldly.</p>

  <p>Daily threw him an indifferent glance? he looked down upon the latter, someone who had entered the Soul City over two hundred times.</p>

  <p>"One thousand feet?" With a faint smile, Dailey said, "It's easy to achieve the Colorless Soul. What I pursue is nothing like what you do. You don't understand anything!"</p>

  <p>At that, Zhu Ge Feng, Carver, and the non-human creatures were all left confused.</p>

  <p>Those who entered the Soul City all pursued the Colorless Soul and the Holy Soul Realm. What else was Dailey pursuing?</p>

  <p>"Look, everyone, and the pride of the Taiyi Heaven Palace," Dailey called out with a smile as the soul pillar under his feet began to rise.</p>

  <p>The pillar rose rapidly, as did its number.</p>

  <p>One hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Two hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Three hundred feet.</p>

  <p>In about thirty seconds, Dailey had risen to a height of over eight hundred feet before going straight to nine hundred.</p>

  <p>"That is fast!"</p>

  <p>"The soul cloud imposes no hindrance to him whatsoever?"</p>

  <p>"It seems he can pass through the Soul City this time?"</p>

  <p>Before the speaker could finish speaking, the number on Dailey's soul pillar revealed one thousand.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>When the number appeared, the entire dense soul cloud began emitting a faint light, indicating that Dailey had passed.</p>

  <p>"I knew he could do it fast!"</p>

  <p>"I'm so jealous. He can safely pass the Soul City and go to the upper stage on the Other Shore now."</p>

  <p>"Eh? Wait, look..."</p>

  <p>Normally, so long as people reached a thousand feet, they would be relieved before jumping down from their soul pillars. It was meaningless to remain there or continue going beyond the finish line, after all.</p>

  <p>But as everyone gazed upon him, Dailey did not leave. Instead, he continued rising just as the number on the soul pillar continued increasing.</p>

  <p>"What does Dailey want to do?"</p>

  <p>"He wants to make a name for himself in the Soul City?"</p>

  <p>"No, I heard a stronger level lies above the Holy Soul Realm, so long as we have the ability to continue to advance."</p>

  <p>From the soul cloud, a light shot into the sky. Dailey sat upright on the soul pillar as he rushed out of the soul cloud and continued rising in the light.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, isn't the limit of the Soul City a thousand feet?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, looking at Dailey.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven chuckled and said, "For the vast majority of people, it's indeed a thousand feet. Crossing this height means one will obtain a Colorless Soul and reach the Holy Soul Realm. But do you remember I told you that the Holy Soul Realm is not the end?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He had indeed told him when they first met.</p>

  <p>"When one achieves the Colorless Soul, they will have a chance to try and reach a higher level. There is only one chance of this. If one misses it, there will be no second chance. But most of them choose to give up because moving forward proves to be too difficult," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, looking at Dailey who was above the soul cloud. "He is an outstanding warrior of perception. He should be able to obtain a Holy Soul Imprint."</p>

  <p>"A Holy Soul Imprint?" Luo Zheng asked, raising his brows.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "One imprint should be his limit."</p>

  <p>Having already reached a thousand feet, Dailey found it difficult to go further.</p>

  <p>The fact was now obvious to most.</p>

  <p>While Dailey was indeed extraordinary, it wasn't easy for him to move upward in the light, let alone quickly.</p>

  <p>An hour later, he had risen up to eighty feet, with the soul pillar showing a thousand and eighty feet.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A golden imprint circled Dailey, attaching itself to the very surface of his soul. He then jumped down from the soul pillar and fell hard to the ground.</p>

  <p>Although the crowd couldn't see Dailey's face clearly, they could still feel his great joy.</p>

  <p>When he entered the Soul City for the eighth time, he already had the confidence to rise up to a thousand feet. For so long, he had prepared to reach his goal of the Holy Soul Imprint.</p>
