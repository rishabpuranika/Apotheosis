<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji's body trembled as he stared at his wounds.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi still stood with his hands behind his back, an indescribable sadness washing over him.</p>

  <p>He had read through all the memories of his clone after taking his body.</p>

  <p>The two emperors had once been as close as brothers, but had turned against each other in the end. The thought of it made Eastern Emperor Taiyi sigh.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>Blood dripped down from Emperor Ji's body. Nobody dodged it, but instead looked up at the movements above them.</p>

  <p>"You are no match for me," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said calmly.</p>

  <p>If he was up against the real Emperor Ji, he might not come out on top, but compared to his clone, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was much more capable in terms of control of the blood and combat.</p>

  <p>The corners of Emperor Ji's eyes twitched. He raised his hand and a huge flame began to condense into a long spear.</p>

  <p>He would not allow himself to fail, even if it cost him his life!</p>

  <p>But just as the enormous flame spear formed, a crack suddenly appeared between his eyebrows and an eyeball drilled through it.</p>

  <p>"Come back. You really are no match for him," said Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>The eyeball allowed them to not only share the Other Shore Tokens, but to observe and convey information to each other as well.</p>

  <p>When Emperor Ji and Eastern Emperor Taiyi fought, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer were watching.</p>

  <p>"Not only are you no match for him, but even I would meet the same fate as you if I faced him," said Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>Their tones were rife with caution. It seemed they regarded Eastern Emperor Taiyi as quite a formidable foe.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Emperor Ji was not convinced. "He is not the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Why is he so powerful?"</p>

  <p>"He is indeed not the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but he might be another Eastern Emperor Taiyi," said Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>"Another Eastern Emperor Taiyi? What do you mean?" Emperor Ji asked as his heart sank.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng was able to deactivate your Nine-Sun Destruction Theurgy because someone called Houyi gave him a bow. There is another me, another Divine Farmer, and another Emperor Ji in this world."</p>

  <p>"What?" This news surprised Emperor Ji. "How could such people exist?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Same as the people of the Li Shan mountain, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer had been searching for the human race on the Other Shore since their birth.</p>

  <p>However, the clues left by the human race on the Other Shore were all recorded in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree which was in the hands of the Snake Goddess. For this reason, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer knew much less about the human race on the Other Shore than the Snake Goddess did.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race in the upper stages had seen everything that the Moon Fire Slaves had seen, so they knew Luo Zheng had entered the Creation Myth Temple and taken the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>As the second ruling civilization, the Element Spirit race naturally knew the movements of the human race on the Other Shore. To them, the so-called secrets were not secrets at all.</p>

  <p>But they had never revealed any information to Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer. The reason was very simple. They supported Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer because they wished to fragment the human race. So how could they tell them the history of the human race on the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan had just been to the Other Shore. It was not until he asked about Luo Zheng's Sun Shooting Bow that the Element Spirit race told him the secrets they knew. Now that they had reached this point, the Element Spirit race had complete control of them, leaving them no right to turn back.</p>

  <p>But the truth shocked him and he immediately confessed it to Emperor Ji.</p>

  <p>"So I'm just a clone?" Emperor Ji murmured.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi still looked at him calmly. After Emperor Ji had turned into a Wild God, his body had become colossal. Although he murmured low and soft, Eastern Emperor Taiyi heard him clearly. Since Emperor Ji now knew he was a clone, he might have known some of the truth.</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji lowered his head and thought a while before dissipating the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>His gigantic body shrunk back to its normal size.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi stared at the small sized Emperor Ji and dissipated his Wild God Power as well.</p>

  <p>"You are the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, right?" Emperor Ji asked, disheartened.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded and said, "Yes."</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji looked down at the Taiyi Mountain and said, "I want to see my real self."</p>

  <p>This sudden request surprised Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but he didn't hesitate and quickly replied, "Okay."</p>

  <p>The two came back one after another.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had no idea what they were up to, but seeing Emperor Ji making his way back made them nervous.</p>

  <p>Among the warriors, only a few could still fight. Li Bianxue was one of them. As Emperor Ji came back, they stepped forward and surrounded him in case he decided to attack suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, he wishes to see his real self," said Eastern Emperor Taiyi through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was astonished. He hesitated a moment and the real Emperor Ji said in his mind, "Let me meet him. I can talk to him."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in approval. Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood beside him while Emperor Ji, who had lost an arm and a wing, stood opposite Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A faint light flashed and the shadow of the real Emperor Ji appeared above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>After staring at his real self for a while, Emperor Ji finally brought himself to ask, "They say I'm your clone. Is it true?"</p>

  <p>"It's true," replied the real Emperor Ji.</p>

  <p>"Why did you create me?" Emperor Ji asked.</p>

  <p>"We want you to make the last attempt to complete the Finale Way," the real Emperor Ji said.</p>

  <p>"Is that also why you created Divine Farmer and Xuanyuan?"</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji asked.</p>

  <p>"That's correct. In fact, we have sowed many seeds, but most of them haven't survived. You are one of the lucky few, so are Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer," the real Emperor Ji said with a smile. "I can ask their energy souls to show up."</p>

  <p>"No need." Emperor Ji waved his hand and continued, "But why are we on different paths? Why don't we follow the same path as Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi?"</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji felt wronged. Finding out he was a traitor hurt his heart and filled him with regret. But he had betrayed them unintentionally, so he blamed his real self for it.</p>

  <p>The real Emperor Ji sighed and said, "It didn't all go according to plan.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race intervened, and we were trapped in Stage Thirty-three. We could do nothing to help. It was not until Luo Zheng opened the Creation Myth Temple and bore the Civilization Artifact that our energy souls were released."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see. I took the wrong path," Emperor Ji said, lowering his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then I can choose another path."</p>

  <p>While Emperor Ji asked these questions in the presence of Luo Zheng, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer listened intently in another area of the Source World. When they heard Emperor Ji say that he would choose another path, their demeanor shifted drastically.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had told them the truth because they were sure they would not dare to betray them.</p>

  <p>Betraying them now, at this critical moment, would lead to unimaginable consequences.</p>
