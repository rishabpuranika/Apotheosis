<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2069 Gray Light </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Marko finished speaking, the Soul Searching Flag began bursting with rays of gray light.</p>

  <p>The sight brought on some kind of heavy pressure to the five Supreme Lords of the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>After reaching the level of Gold Fighting Soul, the plasticity of one's soul increased. Ordinary methods couldn't harm a Gold Fighting Soul and some warriors who specialized in cultivating the soul even used their own soul to protect themselves from their enemies? some even turned their souls into weapons.</p>

  <p>It was precisely because the Gold Fighting Soul was so strong that when a Supreme Lord fought another Supreme Lord, rarely did either use the power of their own souls. After all, no harm could be done to either.</p>

  <p>But the Soul Searching Flag was a supreme primordial weapon? only a True God could activate it, someone who could unleash this supreme primordial weapon to the extreme.</p>

  <p>Compared to that of the Supreme Lords, Marko's understanding of the soul was on a whole new level? even if Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and the others had a Gold Fighting Soul, it was still difficult for them to resist the Soul Searching Flag's gray light.</p>

  <p>When the rays of light struck the body of Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, he immediately felt his mind turn upside down because his soul couldn't help but leave his body. The gray light was actually trying to absorb his very soul.</p>

  <p>The same went for the four other Supreme Lords behind Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment? Shay, Jamal, Jace, and Alyx.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the five Supreme Lords' expressions became twisted.</p>

  <p>Some rolled their eyes and some had their mouths wide open. Their faces shifted into odd and terrified expressions because their souls were crazily resisting the gray light.</p>

  <p>"Grand Buddha Pagoda? Calm my heart!"</p>

  <p>Under this constant struggle, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment blurted out words unclearly.</p>

  <p>The Grand Buddha Pagoda set up by the five Supreme Lords was a powerful weapon that could be used for both offense and defense.</p>

  <p>The moment his voice fell, the Grand Buddha Pagoda behind them emitted a golden Buddhist light. Simultaneously, waves of Buddhist chanting resounded, as if the gods were softly chanting throughout the sky.</p>

  <p>The chant spread far, far away, audible from dozens of neighboring supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>And this voice contained the magic power of a divine weapon. Listening to it, one couldn't help but be put at ease. One's entire being grew lazy and tranquil, the mind becoming clearer.</p>

  <p>The golden Buddhist light continued to appear on the five Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Under this illumination, the gray light was somehow forcibly repelled and the eyes of the Supreme Lords grew clear once again. Now, there was a hint of fear in their eyes as they looked at the Soul Searching Flag.</p>

  <p>Because Supreme Lords were also living beings, it was normal that they would be afraid of death? the Soul Searching Flag was meant to take their souls away. If the soul was truly taken into the flag, then who would know what sort of inhuman treatment the soul would receive? The secret techniques related to the soul were mostly known for their cruelty and it was likely that anyone subjected to them would end up in a miserable state.</p>

  <p>Seeing Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment had used the Grand Buddha Pagoda to block his Soul Searching Flag, Marko couldn't help but sigh. "There's no need. No matter how hard you struggle, the final result won't change."</p>

  <p>And with that, he waved the Soul Searching Flag once again.</p>

  <p>It fluttered in the air as rays of gray light were emitted.</p>

  <p>He had collected countless souls in the flag.</p>

  <p>Tens of millions of ordinary souls, millions of Jasper Fighting Souls, over a hundred thousand Silver Fighting Souls, and even over three thousand Gold Fighting Souls were taken, along with the souls of seven True Gods.</p>

  <p>When a soul was absorbed into the flag, it was like stepping into a cruel hell. Inside the Soul Searching Flag, the souls fought and devoured each other. No matter how powerful they were, they couldn't escape their fate of enslavement.</p>

  <p>Marko held onto thousands of Gold Fighting Souls as he charged towards Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and the rest.</p>

  <p>These souls were all of different shapes? all of them were from creatures that had died in front of the Soul Searching Flag. Among them were the souls of human warriors, souls of mysterious beasts, and even souls of two Genuine Dragons.</p>

  <p>Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!</p>

  <p>While they were alive, these Gold Fighting Souls possessed great strength. Now that they pounced, they emitted an Mu Ning that was at least ten times stronger than before.</p>

  <p>Seeing these evil spirit-looking souls, the hearts of the Supreme Lords sank.</p>

  <p>Shay, Jamal, Jace, and Alyx were all in the depths of despair.</p>

  <p>Previously, they still had some hope in their hearts. There were many situations where a Supreme Lord could compete with a True God.</p>

  <p>Although a True God's strength was terrifying, one who carried a Heavenly Destiny of a Holy Being was not particularly weak, either.</p>

  <p>But after seeing Marko's method of using the Soul Searching Flag?</p>

  <p>They understood that the difference between them and a True God was all too great.</p>

  <p>In reality, the Supreme Lords weren't to blame for their hope.</p>

  <p>The difference in strength between a True God and another True God could also be wide.</p>

  <p>Although there were many True Gods in the divine land, the ones who could become Holy Beings' disciples were truly the most outstanding ones.</p>

  <p>So when Marko dealt with an ordinary low-rank True God, it wasn't too much of a problem. Marko felt no fear towards the Supreme Lords before him whatsoever.</p>

  <p>"Let's fight it out with him!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment suddenly clenched his teeth. The deep red mole on his forehead began emitting rays of bloody light.</p>

  <p>Crackle!</p>

  <p>Faint traces of blood-red lightning escaped from the red mole.</p>

  <p>He was one of the few top-rank Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe and his Heavenly Destiny carried the strongest profound mystery of Thunder Law that Mike had cultivated, the Blood Refinement True Thunder.</p>

  <p>The blood within the body of Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment began boiling as he crazily activated blood-red lightning bolts.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The lightning formed rings of lightning that circled the souls.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Shay, Jamal, Jace, and Alyx sat cross-legged in the air, chanting an incantation and using their Heavenly Destinies to fight against the Gold Fighting Souls that resembled evil spirits.</p>

  <p>Wuu!</p>

  <p>Aww!</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>All sorts of strange noises came up from this region of the sky.</p>

  <p>Thunder-related cultivation methods originally had extreme restraint towards evil spirits. Although the souls that Marko activated were Gold Fighting Souls, they still weren't able to withstand the power of the Blood Refinement True Thunder.</p>

  <p>Amongst the few top-rank Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe, Supreme Lord of Oracle used the strange Self-destruction Technique to arouse others' fear. Master Feng borrowed the momentum of the universe to be the strongest, while Supreme Lord of Original Sin's cultivation was the most unfathomable. But Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment's Blood Refinement True Thunder was undoubtedly the most powerful. He had once flown to the edge of the universe and melted a massive hole into the Sighing Wall with the Blood Refinement True Thunder.</p>

  <p>This wall was incredibly thick? it should have taken tens of thousands of years for the Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment to break through it, but he managed to penetrate it.</p>

  <p>Crackle!</p>

  <p>A single Blood Refinement True Thunder could pierce through dozens of souls.</p>

  <p>But there were simply too many Gold Fighting Souls in this flood. He constantly burnt his blood essence, activating the Blood Refinement True Thunder and yet the number of Gold Fighting Souls still continued to increase.</p>

  <p>"It's really not worth it."</p>

  <p>Marko shook his head. Gathering so many Gold Fighting Souls wasn't an easy matter? Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment's Blood Refinement True Thunder was undeniably amazing. Marko himself didn't dare to test just how powerful it was.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Soul Searching Flag in his hand shook slightly as if there was something within it struggling to get free.</p>

  <p>The corner of his mouth curved into a faint smile. "Alright, it's been a long time since you came out last time. It's a good time to let you out once for a while."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the flag shook slightly, a gray light flew out from it.</p>

  <p>It was incomparably fast? after rushing out, it drew a thin gray line in the air with incredible speed. The line was billions of miles long, equal to a crossing of two supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>To a Supreme Lord, crossing two supreme worlds with Grand Teleportation was a piece of cake? if they could display the Space Law, then they could easily compress ten billion miles into an extremely short period of time.</p>

  <p>But this gray light didn't use the Space Law? it relied entirely on its own speed.</p>

  <p>Although the soul form was weightless and its speed was abnormally high, the gray streak of light had taken six seconds to traverse ten billion miles? it surpassed the imagination of all beings in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"I didn't make you run that far to get some fresh air. Come back!" Marko shouted coldly as he held the flag.</p>

  <p>So after six seconds, it circled back at an inconceivable speed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, it passed through the space between Supreme Lord Alyx's eyebrows with extreme precision.</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lord Alyx sat cross-legged in the air, his mouth was falling open and the light in his eyes was gradually fading. The soul in his mind had already been devoured? he maintained his posture as he sank.</p>

  <p>Once again, the entire universe shook violently. In the end, Supreme Lord Alyx fell to his death.</p>
