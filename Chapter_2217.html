  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Hallet? Augustus?"</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Luo Luo Zheng had heard of those names.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Although Gu Bei is a Holy Being, his descendants didn't flourish and the number of Gu Clan's members is small. However, the two disciples he has taken are quite outstanding. His first disciple, Hallet in particular, is most likely to become a Holy Being," Master Evil explained.</p>

  <p>Hallet was the first disciple, and Gu Bei's another disciple called Gus who Luo Luo Zheng had seen before was his second disciple.</p>

  <p>"With these two men taking care of you on the Time Sea, you should have been able to do whatever you want," Master Evil joked.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately?"</p>

  <p>When it came to one's background, Luo Luo Zheng had a higher starting level than many core disciples from numerous wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng's opponent was too strong.</p>

  <p>In any case, his first concern was Murphy and even the whole Hall of Holy Beings as well.</p>

  <p>Even if Hallet and Augustus were very powerful, they might not be able to protect Luo Luo Zheng if he just showed up randomly.</p>

  <p>"Clearly, now isn't the right time for me to find them," Luo Luo Zheng said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>The relationship among Luo Xiao, Gu Bei, and Jay might be known in the Hall of Holy Beings. Luo Xiao had been expelled, Gu Bei wasn't in the divine land, and Luo Luo Zheng did not know about Holy Jay's whereabouts.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Gu Bei's disciples were likely to be under Murphy's watch.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't so stupid as to show up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is not suitable to meet them on the Floating Island, but because of this relationship you have with them..." "Of course, there will be opportunities in other places," Master Evil said with a mysterious smile.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Luo Zheng's eyes went wide. "Other places?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Master Evil continued, "You don't know much about the divine land.</p>

  <p>Well, do you remember asking me about the use of the divine might coins?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at the memory, "Right, you said you will tell me the use of the divine might coins when we get to the Floating Island. Well, now is the time."</p>

  <p>Ever since he became familiar with the customs of the divine land, he had great doubts about the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>The black discs didn't look too valuable, but their exchange value was quite high. Even if a proving godly warrior had worked hard for so many years, it was still difficult for them to obtain a divine might coin.</p>

  <p>Therefore, such a currency was deemed as unimaginable in the universe.</p>

  <p>It could be inferred that the divine might coin wasn't a currency released by a clan. Thus, it was safe to say that the divine might coins were very important and could play a great role on all the third-tier, second-tier and even the first-tier clans.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Do you know what is the most powerful in the divine land?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil laughed. Until this point, he still intended to keep Luo Luo Zheng on his toes.</p>

  <p>"Holy Beings?" Luo Luo Zheng asked tentatively. Master Evil shook his head.</p>

  <p>The younger warrior thought for a moment, then he lit up in realization.</p>

  <p>"If it's not the Holy Beings, then it should be the slate," he said with finality.</p>

  <p>The slate he had mentioned was the Ten Thousand Commandments Slate, also known as the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Not even the Holy Beings could resist the slate, which was worthy enough to be known for its strength alone.</p>

  <p>"Bingo." Master Evil nodded then continued, "There are all sorts of rules on the Ruling Slate which have been accumulated through countless divine eras. It is also the product of constant compromise and negotiation between these Holy Beings from the great clans. Do you know how these rules were written on the slate?"</p>

  <p>"Written by hand every now and then?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. That was the way the rules on the Ten Commandments Slates and Hundred Commandments Slates in the divine cities and central divine cities had been written.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng thought that the Ruling Slate was the same.</p>

  <p>However, Master Evil didn't know whether to cry or to laugh at Luo Zheng's curious answer. "Do you think the Ruling Slate is an ordinary slate? The slates you have seen are nothing compared to the Ruling Slate. If the rules could be randomly written on the slate, the divine land will be in chaos," he said in return.</p>

  <p>While the Thousand Commandments Slate in the Six-Burden Divine City was very powerful, it could only resist ordinary top-rank True Gods at most. The rules of the Thousand Commandments Slate were useless when it came to stronger ones, like the disciples of the Holy Beings or more powerful top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Ruling Slate was different.</p>

  <p>Even though the Holy Beings had reached the topmost level in the world, they were still trapped by the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Some of them had once tried to resist the Ruling Slate, and they were harshly punished. History had recorded other Holy Beings who had disobeyed the rules of the Ruling Slate, and they had no choice but to escape from the divine land, wander through chaos, and were destined to never return.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the rules of the Ruling Slate were definitely absolute--except for some minor loopholes.</p>

  <p>For instance, Luo Luo Zheng as a stowaway did not accept the guidance of the Jiang Clan.</p>

  <p>In fact, he also broke a rule of the Ruling Slate; but because he possessed golden blood, Luo Xiao was able to find a loophole in the Ruling Slate, and Luo Luo Zheng managed to avoid the punishment.</p>

  <p>After all, no matter how powerful the Ruling Slate was, it was just a slate. It would only follow the rules, and the rules that had been set would always have some flaws and loopholes.</p>

  <p>"Is there any connection between the Ruling Slate and the divine might coins?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again. He found it hard to connect the two together, so he was still confused.</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. Both changing the rules on the Ruling Slate and writing new rules on it require divine might coins," Master Evil supplied.</p>

  <p>"Writing with divine might coins?" Luo Luo Zheng asked as he blinked. Master Evil glared and said, "First, you have to grind divine might coins to take their essence, and then make magical divine might ink..."</p>

  <p>"Really now?" Luo Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, to control the Ruling Slate was the same as controlling the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was known that the divine might ink was the only material that could leave words on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>"Use the divine might coins to make divine might ink, then you can write the rules that control the whole divine land," Luo Luo Zheng said as his eyes flickered in understanding. "In that case, every wealthy clan will naturally collect divine might coins and establish rules that will benefit their own clan."</p>

  <p>The battle between Murphy and Luo Xiao also involved the changing of rules of the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Xiao's fall, the rules of the Ruling Slate stated that only one True God could participate in the war between two universes.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure the defeat of Evolutionary Universe, Murphy modified the rules on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>It was much cheaper to modify a rule than to add one. If one wanted to do so, they only needed to change the word "one" to "three". With the modification of this rule, Murphy thought that it wasn't a difficult thing to occupy the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had led Blayd and Estelle out from the Immortal Mansion. It was unknown whether it was Gu Bei's counter-attack method or not, but it also destroyed Murphy's plan.</p>

  <p>"That makes no sense..." muttered Luo Luo Zheng. He thought about it for a while, then said, "If I have enough divine might coins, I'll write a rule on the Ruling Slate which states that no one in the divine land can attack me.</p>

  <p>Then, everyone including the Holy Beings won't be able to do anything to me, right?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil's eyes widened again incredulously. "Why don't you directly write 'kill everyone in the Hall of Holy Beings'? Then this world will be yours, right?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not," said Luo Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>"Do you think those Holy Beings are all fools? You are not the only one who had the idea. With so many divine eras that have passed, do you know why no one ever wrote such a rule?" Master Evil asked in return.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng would never think that those Holy Beings were fools.</p>

  <p>Surely, there must be a reason.</p>

  <p>"It needs an astronomical number of divine might coins to write a rule on the Ruling Slate. Even the wealthy clans could hardly accumulate enough divine might coins to write a rule once, and the rules on it are already divided into many levels. The rule you said is too unimaginable, and the cost of divine might coins is also unimaginable. So, such a rule cannot be written down even with all the divine might coins of the wealthy clans. Am I clear?" said Master Evil. Master Evil shook his head. "The numbers of divine might coins that different rules need are also different," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded at the explanation. Had any Holy Being written an invincible rule, they would be undefeated in the divine land, and the current divine land would not be what Luo Luo Zheng saw now.</p>

  <p>What Master Evil had said suddenly enlightened Luo Luo Zheng. No wonder every clan placed so much importance on the divine might coins. Those coins did have an irreplaceable role in the divine land. At the same time however, he had a new doubt about them.</p>

  <p>"These divine might coins don't look like ores. Where did they come from?" he asked. When he was in the Central Region, those cubic crystals came from the mines.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the life vitality crystals and life vitality jades were condensed from the vitality between heaven and earth. Was it possible that divine might coins were also dug out from mines?</p>

  <p>"That's why everyone wants to go to the Floating Islands," Master Evil said with a smile.</p>
