<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Across the entire divine land, no one placed much value on body refining skills. Even the Might Godly Way wasn't truly welcomed here.</p>

  <p>The conservative True Gods were still focused on condensing the Godly Tile in a traditional way, in an attempt to attain the consummation of True God Realm and become Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>This was a path that had been tried, tested and proved by countless True Gods. It was true that ever since the ancient times, only a few people had been capable of standing at its peak, but this remained a successful path.</p>

  <p>That said, this world certainly didn't lack warriors who could take the lead to a new path. At the time, Mike had cultivated the Evolution Godly Way alone and created the Evolutionary Universe. However, there were only very few people like Mike. The paths that were yet to be discovered by people were filled with unknown fog, and some of them even had a huge pit. One could only imagine the difficulty of crossing them.</p>

  <p>Just like the Primal Chaos Technique that Luo Zheng had cultivated, until now, it had been difficult for him to condense a Godly Tile. If it wasn't for the strange mud, Luo Zheng probably still wouldn't have any clue.</p>

  <p>The crowd surrounding Luo Zheng started whispering, a low hum spreading throughout the group.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that Harold used such a strange body refining skill," someone murmured.</p>

  <p>"It's completely beyond the Eight Path Platforms and the Nine Divine Stars. What the hell is this strength source? How can it replace blood?" someone else said, completely dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"That isn't what Harold would do. Isn't he good at calculating the opponent's flaws and killing them in the simplest way?"</p>

  <p>To anyone who knew Harold, he was considered to be one of the most modest and quiet.</p>

  <p>When the Luo Clan's Floating Island had been destroyed, Harold had left without saying a single word. When he turned his head to take a final look, his tender eyes were filled with reluctance, and then he disappeared from the wealthy clans' sight. For a long time, he had even been forgotten by plenty.</p>

  <p>It was also throughout that period of time that the Luo Clan's Floating Island's ranking had dropped significantly.</p>

  <p>Just when the wealthy clans thought that the Luo Clan's Floating Island would sink into the Time Sea by the next time's ranking, Harold strangely appeared in the Arena of Legends. Using his own strength alone, he had nearly shouldered the entire Luo Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Following such, the Luo Clan's Floating Island had been fixed in the third place to last. In other words, it hadn't fallen, not even one place, and it managed to maintain the position for many, many years.</p>

  <p>All this was thanks to a man's loyalty and tenacity.</p>

  <p>But today, for some reason, he came forth presenting his muscles to all the True Gods for the very first time.</p>

  <p>The muscles all over his body were wildly bulged, radiating the beauty of power. That said, his head hadn't changed at all. It seemed rather incongruous to have a huge and thick body combined with a small head.</p>

  <p>When Rachelle saw this scene, she jumped backward, somewhat subconsciously. Her figure seemed to have traveled through space three times in a row. With a distance of several thousand feet, she stared strenuously at Harold.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, on her behalf, felt very pleased to mislead Harold's Deduction Technique.</p>

  <p>All this time, Rachelle had always thought that her strength was above that of Harold. It wasn't that she didn't stand a chance against him, but more that her moves were all exposed to Harold through his Deduction Technique.</p>

  <p>Despite Harold's techniques, her Blood Condensing Machete and Mortal Dust Sword were both first-rank supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>Over time, she had understood more and more about the Murdering Godly Way. In fact, she had come quite close to comprehending the ultimate killing method.</p>

  <p>Despite everything she had acquired, she still hardly came close to breaking the Deduction Technique.</p>

  <p>Today was a different story. Today, she had succeeded in breaking the Deduction Technique! Since Harold had no way of fighting against her, she had decided to return all the previous humiliation to him, thus kicking away the biggest block remaining in her heart.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to her that she would have unknowingly unleashed a freak that she couldn't even understand herself. Right now though, she was feeling the sense of danger that Harold brought with him, even stronger than that of a few Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Harold kept staring at Rachelle with his mild eyes.</p>

  <p>Despite everything that was going on, his eyes were still full of warmness, which generally made people feel at ease and comfortable.</p>

  <p>Even so, a chill gushed out of Rachelle's heart. Harold said to her, "I truly apologize for what I'm about to do. Please forgive me."</p>

  <p>As soon as Harold finished speaking, he disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>The spatial transference of the consummate True God was very different from Zheng's understanding of the Grand Teleportation and space traveling in the universe. It barely had any signs, nor was there the so-called space fluctuation. On other words, once the consummate True Gods were on the move, their speed was faster.</p>

  <p>As soon as Harold disappeared, Rachelle rushed forward with her arms spread wide. Although she couldn't use the Evolution Godly Way nor the Deduction Technique, she knew that she had to be very quick with her next step.</p>

  <p>The very moment she stretched her arms outward, she began to spin in the air, as though a bloody whirlwind or tornado was carrying her upward into the air.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Harold suddenly appeared behind Rachelle. As she had expected, he was already grabbing at her with one hand. Seeing that Harold's movements were exactly what she had imagined they'd be, she felt absolutely delighted.</p>

  <p>Through the sharpness of her Blood Condensing Machete and her Mortal Dust Sword, as well as through her Murdering Godly Way and ultimate killing intent, she planned to chop Harold into bits and pieces.</p>

  <p>Despite her intentions, she had forgotten that Harold could still deduce her every move.</p>

  <p>At that very moment though, she no longer resisted Harold's Deduction Technique. Harold could nearly hear every word she cried out hysterically and even her counter-attack.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Harold's right hand pierced through the whirlwind made by Rachelle and he grabbed onto her waist.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was very thin and fragile. His hand easily encircled her entire wrist without even trying.</p>

  <p>Her size, in comparison to his, didn't matter because her reaction was quick. In the face of an extremely disadvantageous situation, she suddenly became very serene and calm. In just the blink of an eye, bloody red scales began to appear all over her body.</p>

  <p>In order to win against Harold, she had overly prepared herself. Because he was so willing to fight against her face to face, she no longer had to hide anything from him at all.</p>

  <p>The Murdering Godly Way's most powerful characteristic was its direct attack. There were barely any True Gods who were willing to fight against a True God who cultivated the Murdering Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The sanity in Rachelle's pupils completely disappeared. Simultaneously, her cinnabar field also extended countless tentacles, consistently spreading throughout her body. Wherever the tentacles passed and grazed, her body structures changed accordingly. For anyone looking in, all they could see was Rachelle's body becoming covered in dark red scales.</p>

  <p>"What kind of theurgy is this?! No such a theurgy exists in the Murdering Godly Way," someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Judging from the scales, she seems to have a holy evil body, but I've never seen such a strange one ever before."</p>

  <p>"She has combined at least three types of Godly Ways. I haven't expected that Rachelle is so powerful now. Her clan has really placed great hopes on her," a voice replied.</p>

  <p>For those who were watching this open battle today, they had all imagined that the same thing would repeat itself. To their surprise though, what they saw was completely different from what they had expected. Both sides displayed their unique skills and especially, those that the others had never seen before.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang stared at her sister in the distance, clenching her fists tightly. She didn't expect that her sister would demonstrate her ultimate skill so quickly.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang remembered that her father had once said this move could keep her alive for a short period of time. Within it, she would be almost invincible.</p>

  <p>Just as the idea flashed in Nelly's mind though, the scene that played out before her eyes made her change her mind.</p>

  <p>At the same time, with a colorful glow gleaming on his right arm, Harold grabbed Rachelle with his left hand and waved his right fist just inches away from her face.</p>

  <p>There was a certain drawback in using the strength source, which was that one couldn't completely integrate the strength source into their own body.</p>

  <p>Harold though, seemed to have a better understanding of the Might Godly Way as well as the body refining skills.</p>

  <p>This was even beyond a Holy Being's vision.</p>

  <p>Even Rachelle's ultimate skill, which was claimed to be invincible, couldn't currently bare the Might Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He thrust his fist forward and the punch landed on Rachelle. Dark spikes spread out around Rachelle's body. These spikes were ripples caused by the space shock, which actually spread out for dozens of miles.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Rachelle's body, on the other hand, had been strengthened to a terrifying state. After being punched, her body didn't disassemble in the least. Only countless cracks appeared on her skin as she began to fall downward at high speeds.</p>

  <p>As she fell down by twenty to thirty feet, Harold once again appeared just below Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With the huge space ripples spreading further and further, the second punch hit Rachelle straight on and most of the bloody red scales on her body flew off and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When Harold threw his third punch forward, the scales on Rachelle's body completely dissipated, and in front of all the onlookers, her body did the same. There were only huge black ripples that continued to spread, as if the space shocks that were created by Harold were too strong and they would now spread forever amidst this fake space.</p>

  <p>Harold raised his head and looked out at the spectators, who stood silently watching him. He didn't care about the win. On the contrary, he had more important things to do today.</p>
