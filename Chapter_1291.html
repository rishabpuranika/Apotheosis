  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he saw the wind blade, Luo Luo Zheng got pleased, with a hint of joy on his face. He had finally discovered the black wind blade!</p>

  <p>Realizing that the black wind blade didn't shoot in the right direction, Luo Luo Zheng swiftly adjusted his direction and headed straight towards it.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, the wind blade that contained the fifth layer of Wind Law directly hit Luo Zheng's chest!</p>

  <p>"Power Transfer!"</p>

  <p>When the black wind blade hit his chest, Luo Luo Zheng ensured to simultaneously use the will of the great world to search for the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng's gaze faintly flickered. An indistinct white mark became visible at the bottom of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>The wind blade containing the fifth layer of Wind Law could only leave a faint mark. So how long would it take him to cut this massive Magnetic Sacred Mountain?</p>

  <p>There was a trace of depression in his face.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng resolutely would not give up that easily. During his stay in the Central Region, he not only focused on cultivating, but he also needed to prepare to fly into the Upper World.</p>

  <p>He quite fully understood then that preparedness ensured success and unpreparedness spelled failure. Since he was able to achieve it with a small price, why wouldn't he do it?</p>

  <p>So he continued moving forward. As he plodded on, he mentally noted that the number of black wind blades increased, while the number of cyan wind blades decreased.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>The moving tracks of the black wind blades were different, and Luo Luo Zheng could only try his best to use his body to collide with them. With this constant collisions, streams of power kept transferring to the bottom of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Ten streams of power..."</p>

  <p>"One hundred...</p>

  <p>"One thousand..."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the onlookers, these black wind blades were deadly, seeming to represent the death god. But it was not for Luo Luo Zheng as he could not wait to charge at them.</p>

  <p>He swiftly hit them! Soon he had been able to smash three thousand black wind blades! When Luo Luo Zheng checked the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, the power of the three thousand wind blades was transferred by him to the bottom.</p>

  <p>And now, he had finally cut a little part of the mountain, leaving a tiny cut as thick as a thumb!</p>

  <p>Witnessing this scene, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help feeling disappointed. He was speechless!</p>

  <p>His effort of gathering the power of thousands of black wind blades only left a tiny mark on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>He deduced that a large mountain was always thin at the top part, and was massive at the bottom. How many black wind blades would it take to peel off the Magnetic Sacred Mountain from its base? Would it need hundreds of millions or even billions of wind blades?</p>

  <p>If so, it might be impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to execute that with the wind blades alone. Although there were a lot of black wind blades in the storm, and they were distributed in the sky above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, but they would not rush towards him all at the same time! Luo Luo Zheng admitted that he did not have the power to attract all of the black wind blades, so he would have to rely entirely on himself to hit those black wind blades, which might probably take decades to peel off the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Luo Luo Zheng didn't have the resolution and persistence to move a mountain. And it never daunted him in the first place. It was just that he didn't have enough time.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, he could only continue moving closer to the center of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had once entered the center of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. He didn't find anything special aside from a few powerful ferocious beasts.</p>

  <p>He thought that with the devastating storm, those eleventh-level beasts probably wouldn't dare to float onto the surface of the sea. The only things left in the surroundings were the black wind blades.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng continued to advance more than a thousand miles, his eyes suddenly flashed. He saw a strange black wind blade rushing towards him at a rapid speed!</p>

  <p>This black wind blade's shape was the same as that of the black wind blades he hit earlier. But there was something unusual with the way it moved. It would repeatedly disappear and appear during its flight.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, it could become transparent. And at times it looked black, and the two colors alternatively flickered. The Wind Law that emitted from it seemed to be stronger!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was unable to determine which layer of Law Power the wind blade contained. To date, Luo Luo Zheng had only practiced the first layer of the Wind Law. He had just learned from the seven members of the Celestial Position that the black wind blade held the fifth layer of the Wind Law.</p>

  <p>However, the Law Power contained within the weird wind blade that constantly changed colors was higher than that of the other black wind blades. He could only surmise that this wind blade carried the sixth layer of Wind Law.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was currently a bit worried and disappointed. With the strength of the black wind blades, it would take at least ten years for him to cut the mountain. But now, he was overjoyed upon seeing this two-tone wind blade!</p>

  <p>"Dash towards it!"</p>

  <p>The wind blade moved at a fast speed, cutting into his body the moment he lunged forward. Though it closed in with uncanny precision, it didn't stop from changing its colors even once. The gutsy air current emanating from Luo Zheng's body created a thunderous force, causing a whirlpool to surge up from the sea underneath Luo Luo Zheng. And the tremendous explosion of that force nearly made the base of the vortex visible!</p>

  <p>The surge of power arising from the two-colored wind blade was so terrifying. And most of its power was triumphantly transferred by Luo Luo Zheng to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain that was thousands of miles away from Luo Luo Zheng suddenly shook violently!</p>

  <p>For countless years, this Magnetic Sacred Mountain that held the power of five elements had been majestically standing there. And there was no telltale sign of disturbance on the mountain throughout the years. As for even the erosion of the seawater, the slapping of the waves, or the cutting of the wind blades, none of these had been able to shake this mountain.</p>

  <p>After all, it was far away from the center of the storm.</p>

  <p>With that massive amount of power directly penetrating the base of the mountain that continued to quake violently, a large splash of seawater began to roll in. And the seawater surrounding the Magnetic Sacred Mountain became foamy, akin to boiling water as bubbles appeared generously, thus refracting the azure sea into a milky white color as though it was a rice soup.</p>

  <p>"It works!" Luo Luo Zheng blurted out in obvious delight.</p>

  <p>Just a double-colored wind blade was enough to leave a nearly ten feet-long cut on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. The sharp cut was precise that it was as if a god wielded a giant ax and chopped the mountain down.</p>

  <p>It was hard for Luo Luo Zheng to imagine the power of the two-colored wind blade.</p>

  <p>If his execution to transfer the power to the mountain failed miserably in the nick of time, then he would have been sunk without trace by the wind blade.</p>

  <p>"Again!" With newfound hope swelling within him, Luo Luo Zheng glanced around again. But luck was not on him this time as there was no two-colored wind blade at his sight at all!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart was at ease now, and he was feeling so much better. Since he couldn't find the two-colored wind blade nearby, he continued to advance towards the center of the storm to find more.</p>

  <p>He steadily flew further ahead. Along the way, there were only a few two-colored wind blades, but Luo Luo Zheng did not miss any of them. After encountering dozens of two-colored wind blades, the gap at the bottom of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain had grown larger and larger.</p>

  <p>Later on, as he carried on with his pace forward, Luo Luo Zheng began to hesitate.</p>

  <p>He realized that he had no clear grasp of what was at the center of this storm. He wasn't afraid of the double-colored wind blades. It was just that if he encountered some powerful creatures at the center of this storm, dealing with them would be impossible for him. Might he be able to escape by then?</p>

  <p>After a brief moment of hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng braced himself, as he gritted his teeth and charged forward.</p>

  <p>As he made his way towards the center of the storm, he met more and more double-colored wind blades. Every single two-colored wind blade was able to leave a ten-foot-deep cut on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Although this mountain was huge, it would eventually peel off under such attacking and cutting of the wind blades. Luo Zheng's mental state eventually became stable.</p>

  <p>However, just after Luo Luo Zheng advanced for about two hundred miles, he discovered a new type of wind blade. It was a golden wind blade!</p>

  <p>What was stranger was that they were not like those ordinary wind blades which shot into all directions. Instead, they gathered and moved together, like a flock of birds flying smoothly in the air.</p>

  <p>"Are these wind blades intelligent?" Luo Luo Zheng was amazed as he stared at the golden wind blades.</p>

  <p>So to speak, the wind blades were the things created in a storm. The stronger the wind blade was, the higher the level of Wind Law it contained. But no matter how powerful the wind blade was, it might not be able to produce a pearl of wisdom. To put it bluntly, it was nothing but just a gust of wind.</p>

  <p>There were too many mysteries in this universe that were left unsolved.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng fused with the will of the great world, making him all-powerful and invincible, but sadly some things still confused him.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was too engrossed in observing the clumps of golden wind blades, some of them noticed him. One of the golden wind blades circled in the distance, and the other golden wind blades also started chasing after him!</p>

  <p>'Flee!'</p>

  <p>At that unexpected turn of event, this was the only thought that crossed his mind.</p>
