  <p>
</p>

  <p>The wedding of Luo Zheng and Mu Ning had been the liveliest day in the entire Evolutionary Universe!</p>

  <p>The existence of Roaring Tokens had already become a part of the tradition in expressing one's blessing.</p>

  <p>This was also known as the most extravagant method of conveying good wishes for a celebration. After all, all the other Roaring Tokens were disposable compared to Zheng's Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>But on this auspicious day, the wishes and greetings for the husband and wife echoed throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>"Today is the wedding day of Luo Zheng and Mu Ning. I, Leandro, on behalf of the Western Spirit Sacred Place wish you a long and happy marriage…"</p>

  <p>"We wish you a wonderful beginning, and love to last for a lifetime. May the coming years fill your lives with love and happiness! This is the blessing from Dragon Dust Sacred Place for Luo Zheng and Mu Ning…"</p>

  <p>"Bless them as unmovable and eternal, and may their lives flourish like luxuriant trees! We wish for the bride and groom, together with the heaven and earth, the sun and the moon, to continue to give out light and radiance.…"</p>

  <p>Waves of congratulations resounded all through the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Servants in formal attire busily moved around with their own tasks in the grand hall. The grand hall was situated at the foot of the Breaking Cloud Mountain. Thousands of musicians were drumming in unity as melodious sounds of joyous music continuously wafted about.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were mostly humble, keeping a low profile. The wealth and glory which mortals desired were things that weren't new to them. They had already experienced such grandeur though it didn't stop them from enjoying the celebration.</p>

  <p>It was a fulfillment of promise. Luo Zheng never thought that it would be such a sumptuous wedding ceremony. As Mu Ning only wished for a more extravagant wedding, he could only accept and cooperate with the preparation. The ceremony had been arranged by the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>"Grandpa, this way!"</p>

  <p>The person who spoke was the talent of the Ethereal Spirit Sect in the Central Region, Brent.</p>

  <p>Brent looked different compared to the young and inexperienced him back then. He had already entered the Life and Death Realm, and became the mainstay of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. This time, he appeared more mature as he led Xander towards the entrance of the hall.</p>

  <p>With the powerful means of the Celestial Position, it wouldn't be difficult for them to usher the people from the Central Region to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Brent was very curious about everything that was going on around him as it was the first time he had stepped into the Upper World, "Powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors! There are so many of them. And they are only guarding the entrance?"</p>

  <p>Astonishment was shown on his face. On either side of the hall, standing in a row were three hundred warriors in golden armors, and all of them were at the Soul Sea Realm. If any one of them were placed in the Lower World, they would be titled as war kings or war emperors. However at this moment, they were just placed as guards in this place.</p>

  <p>Even though Xander was only at the Life and Death Realm, he had lived far longer than Brent. He had more or less known about the situation in the Upper World. He was aware that the Soul Sea Realm powerful warriors, who claimed themselves kings or emperors in the Lower World, were nothing in the Upper World. Looking at the situation in reality, it still gave him a shock but he was calm not to show the surprise expression on his face.</p>

  <p>An enormous number of guests attended the ceremony, reaching to a hundred thousand people. They were divided into several categories and there was a special team in the Celestial Position that received them.</p>

  <p>The first class included the Supreme Lords of the various great races, as well as the new Supreme Lords of this year. The second class were the leaders of the great powers. The third class included the grand world lords. The fourth class included the Saint Lords of the tenth grade sacred places followed by the fifth class consisting of ordinary world lords.</p>

  <p>The guests were then escorted to their seats according to the arrangement. Inside the hall, there was a square paved with jade and stone.</p>

  <p>Entering the square, Brent noticed the ten towering jade pillars erected at the side of the square. It made him confused. "What are these pillars for?"</p>

  <p>"Heh, how ignorant!" One of the warriors sneered. He casually sized up Brent and Xander, his face revealing a strange expression. "Where did you two come from? How could two Life and Death Realm little guys sneak in?"</p>

  <p>To be called a little guy, it was still acceptable to Brent. However for Xander, who was already over a thousand years old, it was difficult in any matter to link him to the word 'little'.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, seniority was always measured by cultivation. Age was only secondary.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Brent glared at the martial artist. It didn't matter if he was scolded, but since Xander had been offended, how could he bear it?</p>

  <p>"What are you saying!"</p>

  <p>Just as he finished his words, Xander waved his hand signaling him not to argue anymore and be quiet.</p>

  <p>Just now, Xander had examined the warrior but he was unable to see through his cultivation. This meant that this warrior's cultivation was far above the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p id="top_13">He knew that those present were all important figures. He was naturally afraid that Brent would impulsively offend them!</p>

  <p>The warrior who spoke to them was a world lord. In the eyes of a world lord, a Life and Death Realm martial artist was someone who hadn't even crossed the threshold of learning martial arts. In the sacred place he governed, Life and Death Realm warriors were still considered trainees.</p>

  <p>How dare the boy talk back at him?</p>

  <p>The warrior chuckled. "Seeing you two sneaking around, I'm afraid that you are just trying to take advantage of the big scene and gain some profit. I will send you off on behalf of the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>The warrior then stepped forward. With a casual wave of his hand, a space crack appeared in front of him. At once, he grabbed Brent and was about to stuff him into that space crack… The warrior was actually using the Grand Teleportation to drive them away.</p>

  <p>With this kind of cultivation, how could Brent and Xander possibly have any chance to resist?</p>

  <p>Right before he could throw them into the space crack, another space crack instantly appeared beside him. A cold voice rang out from within!</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>The owner of the cold voice appeared and it was actually Supreme Lord Mirage of the Celestial Position!</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of Supreme Lord Mirage made the warrior immediately stilled and stunned.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists in the hall quickly stood up and cupped their hands together in greetings.</p>

  <p>"S...Supreme Lord Mirage," the warrior cried, startled. He seemed to realize that he had done something wrong, but still reported, "These two little thieves snuck into here, and I am now sending them away for you…"</p>

  <p>Being gripped by the warrior, Brent found that he was unable to revolve his life vitality. His face was full of gloom but as soon as he heard the warrior called the person who came right in time before they were sent back 'Supreme Lord' in awe, he too was shocked.</p>

  <p>However, his eyes flashed when he looked up and laughed, "I've seen you before! You have been to the Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>"Brent, don't be rude. You must greet the Supreme Lord." Xander knew that a Supreme Lord was the peak existence in the universe, a great figure they could not even take a glance at.</p>

  <p>Brent might look much more mature than before, but his natural disposition was still hard to change. He still had that jerky smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He had indeed seen Supreme Lord Mirage before. Back in the days when all the warriors in the Central Region gathered at the Cloud Hall, they encountered an invasion from the sorcerer race. It was at that time that Supreme Lord Mirage had made a move in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage stared at the warrior who made the fuss. With a casual grab of him, Brent felt an invisible force pull him over as he found himself standing firmly on his feet. Then, Supreme Lord Mirage politely said to Xander, "I am truly sorry. This time, there are too many guests that sometimes there are some unavoidable omissions. I hope you Xi Clan can forgive us!"</p>

  <p>Witnessing Supreme Lord Mirage's attitude, the world lords around were all stunned. Supreme Lord Mirage was actually being so courteous towards the two Life and Death Realm warriors. They couldn't believe their eyes!</p>

  <p>What was the Xi Clan?</p>

  <p>They had heard of the Xuanyuan Clan. the Ji Clan where Lucille came from, and another Ji Clan where Janet came from. But they never heard of the Xi Clan.</p>

  <p>Some people though were quick to analyze things. Wasn't it that the woman Luo Zheng would marry today had a surname Xi? These two were the guests from the bride's family!</p>

  <p>After expressing his apology, Supreme Lord Mirage reached out his hand and grabbed the rude martial artist. He copied what the martial artist had done moments ago and actually used the Grand Teleportation to throw him into the space crack. It was just that the distance Supreme Lord Mirage's Grand Teleportation covered would be countless times greater than what the warrior could achieve. He had directly thrown the martial artist out of the Breaking Cloud World.</p>

  <p>Brent and Xander were then led to sit at the very front of the square together with the group of Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Brent went completely obedient after being seated. Although he was filled with curiosity about his surroundings, he still felt great pressure from the Mu Ning faintly emitted by the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he finally figured out what the ten pillars were used for.</p>

  <p>A series of thunderous dragon roars soon bellowed from the sky as ten dragons hovered in the sky.</p>

  <p>The nine Genuine Dragons were once capable of transforming into human shapes, but having Heavenly Bodies made it difficult for them to transform into other forms. The Ancestral Dragon, although had gained intelligence but was still unable to transform into other forms, so it could only maintain its original form.</p>

  <p>The ten dragons roared and coiled themselves around the pillars with their own different gestures.</p>
