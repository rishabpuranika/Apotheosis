  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi was not shouting but his words were audible enough for everyone to hear clearly. Then, there was a moment of dead silence.</p>

  <p>The Icy Snow Province used to be a part of the Li Shan mountain, so it was close to it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the strongest warriors of the super forces, such as the Jin Wu, the Bearing race, and the Separate Abyss race didn't come.</p>

  <p>Everyone was anxious as they knew the price of disobedience.</p>

  <p>Even Phoenix couldn't contain her anger.</p>

  <p>Her goal was to give the Taiyi Heaven Palace a fatal head-on blow to weaken their morale.</p>

  <p>The news that arrived from the Other Shore frustrated the members of the Jin Wu and the Bearing race. The man named Tianxing had attacked these several super forces relentlessly but they could do nothing to him.</p>

  <p>However, Phoenix didn't expect that Fuxi himself would show up personally.</p>

  <p>"Human Sovereign, does this mean that we can fight outside the Icy Snow Province?" Phoenix asked as she gnashed her teeth.</p>

  <p>She thought that if Emperor Di Jun of the Jin Wu, the Xuanyuan of the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer were here, they might not succumb in fear to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, they were in Fuxi's territory now, so they had no choice but to yield for the time being.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, that's right." Fuxi shrugged, with a fierce glint in his eyes. He stared at Phoenix and continued, "But I have to warn you about one thing. If anyone dares to lay a finger on this young man, death will be the consequence."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the one chosen by the Chaos Ancient God, so Fuxi certainly wouldn't let anyone else kill him.</p>

  <p>Of course, Fuxi knew that it wouldn't be easy to bring Luo Zheng down. He just deliberately advised Phoenix and the others not to use any underhanded tricks on his watch.</p>

  <p>As they heard Fuxi's threat, everyone was taken aback. Phoenix's face changed, just as the leaders of the other races.</p>

  <p>The younger generation who were present also became confused.</p>

  <p>"What's so amazing about him? Why does the Human Sovereign protect him to that degree?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you hear? It's because Fuxi regards him as his rival. Of course he won't let anyone else lay a finger on him."</p>

  <p>"What? How could he be a rival of the Human Sovereign? That's insane!"</p>

  <p>Those who were about to enter the Chaotic Source World were all shocked.</p>

  <p>Even if they had managed to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement and improve their strength to a higher level, they were still considered weak in the Source World where many extremely powerful people dwelled. Even Qiu Yinhe and Phoenix could kill them effortlessly, let alone Fuxi.</p>

  <p>They were all actually in the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. It was impossible that there was a huge gap in strength between them.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a huge flying ship had arrived.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the flying ship, a faint smile appeared in Fuxi's drunk face.</p>

  <p>"Here comes your sister," Fuxi told Luo Zheng as he patted him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Sister?</p>

  <p>Did he just say that Luo Zheng has a sister?</p>

  <p>And this sister that he's talking about is from the Li Shan mountain?'</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>Even Ling Shuang was puzzled.</p>

  <p>She knew Luo Zheng's origin but she didn't know that he had a connection with the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe and Winchell glared at Luo Zheng while letting out a stifled bitter laugh.</p>

  <p>They thought that Luo Zheng, a surviving descendant of the Nine Li race, had no one to back him up. Supposedly, his full loyalty would be to the Taiyi Heaven Palace. With the turn of events, they realized that they underestimated him.</p>

  <p>Only Sally, Hutton, and the other Nine Li people knew of the truth because of the information that Leopold had told them.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain's flying ship didn't stop beside the stone pillars but continuously floated in the air.</p>

  <p>Not long after, several hundred beings were seen jumping out of the flying ship. They turned out to be the members of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was comprised of the Snake Goddess race and some humans who had the blood of the Snake Goddess race, like Emily. These half-blood members, though belonging to the Snake Goddess race, were still humans.</p>

  <p>Similarly, even though Feng Ge had the blood of the Jin Wu, she didn't have a pair of big golden wings on her back like Phoenix.</p>

  <p>About five hundred members of the Li Shan mountain had come, a little more than those of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>Most of them were half human and half snake, dragging a long tail. Nearly a third of them looked the same as humans.</p>

  <p>Just as they landed, a human girl quickly came out from them.</p>

  <p>It was Yan who was searching for Luo Zheng. Soon after, she finally found him staying with the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Yan rushed towards Luo Zheng and embraced him tightly.</p>

  <p>She missed Luo Zheng very much. Luo Zheng was expected to come when the Chaotic Source World opened. Now that she finally saw Luo Zheng, she was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"Yan, I'm glad you're alright."</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng knew that she was safe under Emily's protection in the Li Shan mountain, he was still worried that it would be hard for a young girl like her to stay there alone.</p>

  <p>He was glad that his worry seemed to be unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"Hey! You didn't say anything strange to my brother, did you?" Yan suddenly turned to Fuxi and stared at him fiercely.</p>

  <p>She knew something about Fuxi and became worried that he might do something bad to her brother.</p>

  <p>Others didn't know if Fuxi owed her or if she had something on him for her to dare to talk to him in a very uninhibited manner.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was surprised to hear Yan speaking that way.</p>

  <p>After all, Fuxi was the Human Sovereign.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Ling Shuang, Qiu Yinhe, and the others were so shocked that they had a hard time breathing due to apprehension.</p>

  <p>They couldn't believe the audacity of Luo Zheng's sister.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the members of the Snake Goddess race looked calm, as if they had already been accustomed to this kind of scene.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Fuxi's reaction was beyond everyone's expectation. He was even no longer drunk as he responded submissively, "No, of course not!"</p>

  <p>"If you dare talk nonsense to my brother, you're going to get it," Yan said with a stern face as she waved her fist in front of him.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned as they didn't know what was going on.</p>

  <p>The title of the Human Sovereign was a symbol of strength and status.</p>

  <p>As one of the most powerful masters in the Source World, Fuxi exuded an aura of unmatched authority. However, none of those seemed to matter as he stood passively in front of Yan.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe and the others were extremely shocked.</p>

  <p>They couldn't stop thinking of what could have possibly happened between them.</p>

  <p>They observed that Yan enjoyed a high status in the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>She was surrounded by a crowd of the Li Shan mountain members as she got off the flying ship.</p>

  <p>However, that wasn't an enough explanation for what was happening.</p>

  <p>How could Yan scold the Human Sovereign in this way, and why didn't he dare to retort?</p>

  <p>It was a scene that nobody would believe if they didn't see it with their own eyes and hear with their ears.</p>

  <p>Being threatened by Yan in public, Fuxi felt a bit humiliated. Thus, he tried to make an escape. He said, "Well, I don't need to keep the order here.</p>

  <p>Members of the Li Shan mountain, please go to your place."</p>

  <p>After saying that, he no longer gave Yan any chance to speak. His figure swiftly distorted and flashed away in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I can't believe he just ran away like that!"</p>

  <p>From Yan's expression, it seemed that she wasn't really finished yet, and had no intention of letting Fuxi go at all.</p>
