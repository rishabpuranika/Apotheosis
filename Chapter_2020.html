  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had resolved the conflict in the Demon Night race, he would have to take action against the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>During that time, Maha had constantly suppressed the momentum of the universe in the Sunflower Water World. Many world lords went to the Sunflower Water World, but Maha had murdered them all! His strength was simply above any of the world lords who fought him.</p>

  <p>Many warriors in the universe had also raised questions through the Roaring Tokens. They asked where Luo Luo Zheng and the Godly Geniuses were.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Luo Zheng and Godly Geniuses were unaccounted could have detrimental effects on the morale of the other warriors.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Celestial Position and the Sacred race all started to lay out their plans in the Sunflower Water World. The fight with the Sacred race would probably begin any time soon.</p>

  <p>If the battle were to begin, the world lords and grand world lords would die quickly. A Supreme Lord could easily overpower any world lord or grand world lord. The true main force would be the Supreme Lords of both sides!</p>

  <p>Since the internal dispute of the Demon Night had been settled, the Demon Night and the ogre would also help the humankind. Also, the Supreme Lords of various races in the universe would join the war to help the humankind. Their army grew quite large and powerful.</p>

  <p>However, the number of Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe was still less than the number of Supreme Lords from Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Wynn, the only True God of the Celestial Position, and the head of the Celestial Position didn't have confidence in the battle. Even if Luo Luo Zheng returned, the atmosphere in the universe was still very pessimistic.</p>

  <p>Everyone was aware of how powerful the Sacred race was. Despair had crept into their hearts.</p>

  <p>That time, Luo Xiao wanted to assist Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back then, Gus also knew that sooner or later, Luo Luo Zheng would face the Supreme Lords. That was why he recommended the Enemy Repelling Arts to Luo Luo Zheng. That cultivation method was said to be a powerful tool to restrain a Supreme Lord. It would greatly benefit Luo Luo Zheng if he could master such a cultivation method.</p>

  <p>However, although the cultivation method seemed simple and easy to understand, it was actually extremely difficult to master. It required a lot of focus and perseverance from the warrior.</p>

  <p>The fastest way to cultivate the Enemy Repelling Arts was to exchange moves with a Supreme Lord. Moreover, the Supreme Lord also needed to make use of the Heavenly Destiny to spar with the warrior who practiced the Enemy Repelling Arts. The complicated requirements made the cultivation method rather difficult to comprehend.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Luo Zheng did not possess such a condition. Therefore, even though he tried his best to comprehend the profoundness of the technique, he was ultimately unable to master it.</p>

  <p>The Enemy Repelling Arts had been divided into two parts; the Profound Cause-eliminating Technique and the Profound Effect-eliminating Technique.</p>

  <p>The Profound Cause-eliminating Technique was to cut the cause while the Profound Effect-eliminating Technique was to destroy the effect!</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality that the Supreme Lord released was often unreasonable. Some token only needed to trigger a simple cause to gain the effect. Additionally, the effect exhibited exponential consequences compared to the cause! The methods that connected the cause and effect were genuinely incredible!</p>

  <p>For example, the use of the Roaring Token also triggered a Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>With a martial artist's strength, they couldn't spread their voices to every corner of the universe. Their voices would simply be not loud enough to travel to the ends of the world.</p>

  <p>However, the Roaring Token contained a 'cause'. As long as it was activated, it would let the voice spread throughout the entire universe.</p>

  <p>That was the Law of Causality formed in the Evolutionary Universe. A simple cause could contribute to a tremendous effect.</p>

  <p>The "Cutting the Cause" in the Profound Cause-eliminating Technique of the Enemy Repelling Arts was to cut off the connection between cause and effect! It would cut the connection between the action and the outcome!</p>

  <p>If the causality were divided into two and no longer connected, then the Heavenly Destiny would cease to exist. The disruption of the link to the cause would dissolve the technique itself!</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord that had lost the Heavenly Destiny was only slightly stronger than an ordinary grand world lord. That wasn't too formidable.</p>

  <p>If that happened during a fight, the Supreme Lord that had lost the Heavenly Destiny could easily die by the hands of another Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who sat upright on the path of golden light, silently chanted the formula of the Enemy Repelling Arts in his heart. An intense focus was seen in his expression. He then abruptly pulled out a long sword.</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword had already fallen into the deepest parts of the Rosy Cloud World. Additionally, it penetrated through the entire supreme world and fell into the Lower World. Luo Luo Zheng didn't have enough time to find it yet, so he could only use a second-rank divine weapon to replace it temporarily.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng employed the Profound Cause-eliminating Technique, a distinct glimmer of cyan light extended across his arm. He studied that glimmer of light with curious eyes. However, that glimmer of light looked faint and seemed not to contain much power!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng continued to practice the cultivation method, the dim and cyan light gradually extended toward the sword in his hand. It crept towards the sword like a bright bluish flame.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Zheng's sword had a hint of a misty glimmer on it. The originally snow-white blade now shone with a glimmer of cyan light!</p>

  <p>Power seemed to flow through the light and imbued on the sword.</p>

  <p>The cyan light was the "Causality Breaking Light" recorded in the Profound Cause-eliminating Technique... It was rather easy for Luo Luo Zheng to condense the Causality Breaking Light...</p>

  <p>With his talent, he didn't have many shackles in his cultivation. A genius of his caliber could easily achieve such a task.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Luo Xiao saw the Causality Breaking Light and slightly nodded towards Luo Luo Zheng. Luo Xiao's eyes flashed as a ray of golden light shone on the screen. Immediately, a green lightning bolt extended from the golden light...</p>

  <p>That was one of the profound mysteries of the tenth-layer Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>It was named the Annihilation Thunder. Luo Xiao created that beautiful and deadly technique.</p>

  <p>The power of this Annihilation Thunder wasn't great. It was specifically used to restrain evil spirits. However, compared to the ordinary thunder, the Annihilation Thunder could attack the soul body more effectively. It might not have severe physical damage, but it could obliterate a warrior's soul body.</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>When he saw the Annihilation Thunder flash towards him, Luo Luo Zheng, who initially sat upright on the ground, suddenly moved to avoid the green lightning. At the same time, he waved the sword in his hand, and like a cyan waterfall, the sword flew towards the green lightning bolt with high precision!</p>
