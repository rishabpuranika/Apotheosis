  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the martial artists in Oracle City were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>Before the battle, everyone had been apprehensive due to the difference in cultivation levels between Luo Zheng and Eddie.</p>

  <p>Eddie was someone who had gone through four life and death crises and each one had effectively strengthened him as a warrior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was in the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Though it was an impressive feat for someone his age, the disparity between his and Eddie's cultivation was still quite big.</p>

  <p>Sure, Luo Zheng had been able to take on Internal Elixir Realm warriors and even divine-level talents even when he was just an Illuminating Soul Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>But the difference between the Illuminating Soul Realm and Internal Elixir Realm was entirely different compared to the difference between the Virtual Tribulation Realm and the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>This was the primary reason why both Ning Yudie and the Ancient Tycoon had tried to stop Luo Zheng from taking on Eddie's challenge.</p>

  <p>The only one who could challenge a Life and Death Realm warrior was another Life and Death Realm warrior!</p>

  <p>Warriors who reached this stage were considered the best in all of Central Region. Those at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were simply incapable of facing off against their Life and Death Realm peers.</p>

  <p>This was the root cause of everyone's concern. No matter how skilled Luo Zheng was, the fact remained that Eddie was still a more experienced warrior.</p>

  <p>Of course, both Ning Yudie and the Ancient Tycoon were constantly vigilant in making sure that Luo Zheng would not be harmed. Even if the one-on-one fight had been agreed upon, Zheng's safety was still of paramount importance.</p>

  <p>This was often how sect battles worked. Even if a sect willingly sent a warrior to battle, they would not allow their champion to die by their enemy's hands. This was a tradition that had been kept in practice for thousands of years and this battle was no exception.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if Eddie was ever put at a disadvantageous position, Simon would also not hesitate to attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had managed to land a strike on Eddie with his very first attack, much to the joy of the World Commercial Alliance. This attack signified Zheng's ever-improving prowess and the fact that he had the strength to challenge someone above his level.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is so strong! Not only has he broken through to the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm in just two years, he can also go head-to-head with a Life and Death Realm master!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, but you forget that Eddie is not just an ordinary Life and Death Realm warrior. If Luo Zheng can keep up with Eddie's strength, then an ordinary Life and Death Realm warrior may not even be his match!"</p>

  <p>"You're right! I think the Life and Death Realm leader of Cloud Hall is probably weaker than Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"If he manages to break through to the Life and Death Realm, I have no doubt that he'll be able to face off against Soul Sea Realm warriors!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie agreed on the part where she was probably weaker than Luo Zheng but she wasn't too sure about the rest.</p>

  <p>Simon continued to watch calmly on the side. The wounds Luo Zheng had inflicted upon Eddie couldn't even be considered as a proper injury to the Life and Death Realm master. However, this did not mean that the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom could rest easy.</p>

  <p>'Eddie's too careless. This may not end well, ' Simon thought to himself. It was true that he did not want Eddie to get stronger by obtaining another Purple Power Body, which was why he helped Luo Zheng back then. However, that did not mean that he wanted Eddie to lose. Simon also had his own plans and ambitions that he would not be able to achieve if Eddie was defeated.</p>

  <p>Eddie merely touched the wound on his ribs before it healed instantly. He gave Luo Zheng a smirk. "Not bad! You were actually able to injure me," he remarked. "However, you have to do much more than that if you want to bring me down."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "It's not just a wound. You'd better be careful. You might've been poisoned."</p>

  <p>Eddie's expression suddenly fell. Poison was the number one fear of any warrior. An ordinary poison would not be able to harm Eddie but Luo Zheng was someone who was able to acquire a top-grade sacred weapon, much less a rare, unimaginable poison that could be smeared on his sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but laugh when he saw Eddie's expression. "Just kidding!</p>

  <p>I was just messing with you. Who would've thought that the strongest person in all of Central Region was actually a coward?" After his mocking jeers, Luo Zheng quickly brandished his sword and rushed towards Eddie.</p>

  <p>Eddie had already been wounded once by Zheng's sword. He was not about to get hit a second time.</p>

  <p>Eddie held up the Nameless Saber on one hand and clenched his fist in the other. A dark golden light then emanated from his body. "Let's call it a day brat!" he roared before swinging his fist to the ground.</p>

  <p>A huge, golden fist appeared from the sky. It was as tall as a city wall and emitted a golden light that made it look as if it was the sun. Most of the people present couldn't even look at it directly.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Emperor Fist!"</p>

  <p>The punch was aimed straight at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>An ordinary city wall would leave Luo Zheng unscathed, but the strength of Eddie's Supreme Emperor Fist was a thousand times stronger than one measly wall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that Oracle City spanned a huge amount of area as the punch instantly left a huge, gaping crater several miles wide and a hundred feet deep just in front of the city gates.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lay in the center of the crater. From the top, he looked like a single, solitary, and insignificant dot.</p>

  <p>"Our Emperor is mighty!"</p>

  <p>"Our ruler is mighty!"</p>

  <p>"Our Emperor is mighty!"</p>

  <p>The entire Heavenly Evil Sect began to celebrate, loudly praising the strength of their emperor.</p>

  <p>It was only after reaching the Soul Sea Realm that Eddie would officially qualify as an emperor, but since he had built his divine kingdom ahead of time, he could more or less be considered as one. However, when it came to technicality, his strength was still insufficient to make him a full-fledged emperor.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was beside herself with worry. Luo Zheng was clearly strong enough to withstand such an attack, but she wasn't sure whether he would be injured.</p>

  <p>On the west side of Oracle City, Mu Ning looked out and could see the deep crater that had formed from a distance. She could no longer remain calm at the sight. Never in her wildest dreams did she think that Eddie would be this strong. Could Luo Zheng resist a blow like this?</p>

  <p>"The force of Eddie's punch could probably smash mountains."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Luo Zheng even survived."</p>

  <p>"I've heard Zheng's body is special and almost invulnerable, but I don't think he could withstand that!"</p>

  <p>"He was able to injure Eddie despite only being at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but that was probably his limit. It's only understandable that he couldn't beat such a strong opponent."</p>

  <p>The warriors were abuzz with their discussions.</p>

  <p>But they all spoke too soon. Luo Zheng quickly reappeared on top of the pit. He shrugged his shoulders and patted away the dirt that settled onto his clothes.</p>

  <p>Granted, there was a bit of blood that trickled down from the corner of his mouth, but he treated it as if it was nothing. "It's just so-so," he sneered, smiling coldly at Eddie.</p>

  <p>The discussions immediately halted once Luo Zheng made his reappearance.</p>

  <p>Everyone quickly realized how wrong their judgments were.</p>

  <p>Eddie huffed at the cocky smile on Zheng's face, "You're being stubborn! Take this then!"</p>

  <p>Eddie roared and swung down his fists a second time. The giant, golden fist reappeared and quickly rushed down to crush Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was faster and wiser this time around. He did not let the fist land on him. Rather, he waved his hand and let his forceful energy rush out of his body. The starlight within him began to circulate and surge towards his hand.</p>

  <p>"As I said, it's just so-so, but you don't know your own limits."</p>

  <p>He laughed coldly before punching towards the sky.</p>

  <p>"Star shakes the earth!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body transformed into a blinding ray of light that punched through Eddie's huge, golden fist, shattering it layer by layer.</p>

  <p>The sight stunned Eddie and the next thing he knew, Luo Zheng was already in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Now it's your turn to go down,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured as his fist came crashing down. Unlike him, Eddie did not possess an invulnerable body and would be smashed into meat paste if he got hit.</p>
