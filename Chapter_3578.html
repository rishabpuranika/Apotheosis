</p>

  <p>In the future, the Chaotic Source World would no longer exist, and thus there would be no way to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits. This was probably the last chance for the Evil God to step into the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>"You need to arrange an array to refine the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits. I'll help you get the array arrangement method later," Zheng added.</p>

  <p>His tone was steady, as if he was confident despite the worrying situation he was in.</p>

  <p>After the Chaotic Source Spirits had been successfully placed into his body, the Evil God needed a magic array to refine them.</p>

  <p>This place was too far away from the abandoned Chaotic Source World. It was impossible for Zheng to let the Evil God go there to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits. Besides, Zheng thought the array used to refine them shouldn't be difficult to arrange. He would find an opportunity to inquire about it to make sure before he acted.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" the Evil God asked. Curiosity gleamed in his eyes as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he was interested in the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>However, he was more interested in what Zheng had just said.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was indeed unwilling to be trapped in his inner world.</p>

  <p>"I want to let you out," said Zheng calmly.</p>

  <p>"Let me out?" The eyes of the Evil God flickered. His brows were crossed and his glare was steady. It was hard to believe what he had heard and he couldn't hide the surprise and excitement he felt after hearing what Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Ever since he was caught by Zheng, the Evil God had been desperate and uneasy as he waited for Zheng to devour him.</p>

  <p>Yet, unexpectedly, Zheng didn't do that. Instead, he just imprisoned him and let him study the Ways-blending Energy. However, with his intelligence, he knew just why Zheng did this.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had said before, if he really was the malice of this world, absorbing him would only bring greater trouble to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng had let him go before, but at that time, he had used the Rebirth Land to bind him.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had already discovered the defects of the Rebirth Land, and because of this, he wouldn't use it again.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God was thinking, Zheng spoke, "There's only one condition.</p>

  <p>You'll have to become my Inner-world Generating Avatar."</p>

  <p>Before entering the Chaotic Source World, the Evil God had learned about the Inner-world Generating Avatar. It was a method of refining the creatures in one's inner world into avatars.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Evil God also wanted to refine Zheng into his own avatar. If he could possess a powerful body like Zheng's, then he would be even more powerful.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the final result was the opposite.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued, "However, the ordinary Inner-world Generating Avatar has no consciousness and serves as the avatar of its owner, but I plan to let you keep your consciousness. In other words, you have freedom in most cases, but you can't disobey my orders."</p>

  <p>After returning to the Oneness Sky Palace, Zheng spared some time learning about the Inner-world Generating Avatar. It was not a complicated theurgy.</p>

  <p>He could directly control the avatar in this way, so it was more practical than the Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>Refining the Evil God into an ordinary avatar wouldn't be of much use to Zheng. In fact, when it came to physical strength, the Evil God was far inferior to him. But the Evil God was more talented than him in some aspects. Zheng thought that if he could use the Evil God's talents properly, it would be a great help to him.</p>

  <p>After explaining, Zheng straightened his body and cleared his throat to ask,</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to do that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it looks like I have no choice," the Evil God said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Deep down, the Evil God was willing to do what Zheng offered. No matter what, Zheng's offer was much better than being trapped in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he thought that the Inner-world Generating Avatar might not be...</p>

  <p>As the Evil God was about to be absorbed in his thought, he stopped and realized something. Since Zheng was able to read his mind, he couldn't think of some things.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a few steps forward and waved his hand at the golden fence. The whole fence broke, and the mountain collapsed with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>When the mortals in the kingdoms below saw the mountain collapse, they all panicked in fear. There were shrieks and sounds of the people's feet in stampede.</p>

  <p>"Creator, I..." Edna floated in the air and looked at Zheng with a pleading expression.</p>

  <p>There were many living beings in the inner world, but they weren't aware that there was a big world outside, so naturally, they didn't have too many thoughts in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Once they knew about the outside world, they wouldn't be willing to be confined in this world.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God's wife, Edna had known for a long time that there existed a big world outside. However, rather than visit that big world, she was more willing to follow the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"You can leave with him. I don't have any restrictions for you," Zheng said directly.</p>

  <p>The expression on Edna's face changed and she immediately cheered,</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Creator!"</p>

  <p>Even the Evil God was quite surprised, and there was a trace of joy in his eyes that he hadn't had for a long time.</p>

  <p>Then, with Zheng's permission, the Evil God and Edna went to the main continent to say goodbye to their children.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God had left for a long time, he already became a legend in Zheng's inner world. Many secrets of this world were controlled by his children. Even without his presence, his children still turned out to be outstanding in this world.</p>

  <p>When his children saw that he had returned, they couldn't hide their surprise. When they heard that their father and mother were going to leave together, they were wistful. However, as the children of the Evil God, they understood his pursuit.</p>

  <p>After Zheng dissipated his incarnation, he regained his consciousness. The moment he opened his eyes, he felt a warm breath on his face. Then he saw Margaret's face was very close to him.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Zheng asked, dumbfounded. He blinked his eyes rapidly and crossed his brows.</p>

  <p>Glaring at Zheng, Margaret said, "I saw you meditating in the yard. I was afraid that something might happen to you..."</p>

  <p>She thought Zheng had gone to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Yudie, Xun and the other women had a certain understanding of the Other Shore, but Margaret was completely unable to understand it. In all honesty, she had no interest in understanding it. She only knew that the Other Shore was very dangerous.</p>

  <p>Zheng touched Margaret's head and comforted her in a soft voice, "I just went to my inner world."</p>

  <p>"Why did you go there?" She leaned in towards him, obviously wanting to hear more details. Curiosity was reflecting in her eyes as she waited for his response.</p>

  <p>"Someone is coming out," Zheng answered Margaret simply.</p>

  <p>At his words, Zheng stood up and circled around. He stopped in an empty place and led his hands to the air from his abdomen. Then, Edna in white appeared in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>It was the first time for Edna to come to this world. She looked terrified and curious at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Creator, do you live in this place?" Edna asked.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, Zheng was an all-powerful and invincible god. Although this independent courtyard house was truly exquisite, it was very ordinary and too low for Zheng. This mundane environment confused her.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, who is she?"</p>

  <p>A moment ago, Margaret was as docile as a sheep, but as Edna appeared, her face darkened, as if she was about to lose her temper.</p>

  <p>"She is from my inner world. I promised to release her," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"Just because she is beautiful?" Margaret complained. Her brows were raised and her tone was probing. Margaret narrowed her eyes and gave Edna a look from her head to toe.</p>

  <p>Edna, as the Evil God's wife, was exceedingly beautiful. Margaret felt a great sense of crisis in her heart. In fact, Yudie was looking down from the second floor. Not far away, Trish, Carrie and Aura were secretly sizing Edna up.</p>

  <p>"You're thinking too much." Zheng smiled and shook his head, dismissing the jealousy in Margaret's tone. "Her husband hasn't come out yet. I'll arrange an array for him."</p>

  <p>Although Zheng wasn't really afraid of the Evil God escaping, he thought he should be well prepared and make sure everything was all right before releasing the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Seeing how Margaret acted aggressively in front of Zheng, Edna widened her beautiful eyes in surprise. Her behavior took her aback.</p>
