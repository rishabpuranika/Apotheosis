  <p>
</p>

  <p>Initially, Emily was confident that she could defeat anyone who blocked her as she tried to leave this world.</p>

  <p>To her, she saw the Warden race as hidden bugs, unable to be seen.</p>

  <p>But now that they were right in front of her, they had to prepare for their deaths.</p>

  <p>What she didn't expect was that the Warden race would activate the Strength Equalizing token. As her strength weakened, she had no idea if she could leave the world.</p>

  <p>She grew anxious.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry." Luo Zheng slowly stood up. "Luck has always been on my side.</p>

  <p>I don't think it'll fail me just yet."</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Luo Zheng seemed to be frighteningly confident. Soon enough, her worried face was replaced by a faint smile. This young man was so interesting, she thought.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the other exiles and Wild Gods also woke up one after another.</p>

  <p>After a brief rest, they continued forward.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the platforms, Spark and a few others walked along another road in silence.</p>

  <p>After the Strength Equalizing token was completely exerted, their strength rapidly diminished as well. This brought many inconveniences that the people weren't used to.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the Warden race had arranged everything beforehand. All they had to do was follow as Spark had instructed.</p>

  <p>"They are as weak as we are now, so are the arrogant Emily," Spark whispered. "And we have the help of these Wights. I believe you know what to do next..."</p>

  <p>Lined up and ready, each of these exiles held a jet black bow in their hands.</p>

  <p>These were the most common bows, used by mortals. The bowstrings had been tightened, and the black arrows were also in place. The heads of the arrows glowed with a faint black light.</p>

  <p>Though they seemed intimidating, these bows posed no threat in the eyes of the exiles. In the past, even they were shot by a thousand or more arrows, they never got hurt.</p>

  <p>But right now, they were lethal.</p>

  <p>"Got it," one of the exiles responded, a sinister smile spreading across his face.</p>

  <p>For a few of them, leaving the world might not be that important now. In fact, they would be very happy if they could kill Emily and the others.</p>

  <p>Spark then fished out a cloth bag and took out some black, pungent medicine cakes.</p>

  <p>"You know, those Wights can't even distinguish friends from foes, and they literally eat anything that moves," he explained as he gave out the medicine cakes. "Take these cakes and your bodies would give off the same smell, and then none of them will approach you."</p>

  <p>Though this was an underrated trick, it was important to make do of what they could after the Strength Equalizing token affected everyone.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the exiles took the medicine cakes from Spark and swallowed them whole.</p>

  <p>They all had the hardest time keeping them down, but they all knew it was necessary.</p>

  <p>After everyone got ready, Spark said, "They are almost here. Tyler, you lead three people to A position, which is in the southwest. And Falkner, you go to B position, which is in the northeast..."</p>

  <p>All the high platforms were strategically arranged according to the positions of the Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches.</p>

  <p>Between these high platforms, there were a large number of Wights that were imprisoned there. They would let them out after Emily and her companions entered.</p>

  <p>Tyler immediately led several people and quickly snuck into the shadows.</p>

  <p>Between the two high platforms in the southwest, thousands of Wights were locked behind the thick bars.</p>

  <p>Those Wights imprisoned inside resembled sculptures, standing motionlessly without any trace of life force on their bodies. Though Tyler and the rest had seen a lot in the world, they were still very bothered by the scene.</p>

  <p>"Tyler, what do you think that has happened to these Wights?" one of them muttered.</p>

  <p>They had all seen Wights before, but they never knew their origins or purposes. They had always been mysterious creatures altogether.</p>

  <p>Seeing them right there, in between alive and dead, bothered the exiles to their stomachs.</p>

  <p>Seeing the motionless Wights, Tyler shook his head.</p>

  <p>Even if they reached the Other Shore, they still couldn't seem to understand why the Chaos Ancient God would do this. It was something beyond their understanding.</p>

  <p>"No matter what, be quiet now and be ready," Tyler said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"This move would decide the victor and loser. If we succeed, we will have the chance to leave this world for good."</p>

  <p>As they lurked, they did their best to remain as silent as possible.</p>

  <p>An hour had passed and they began to hear faint footsteps from afar.</p>

  <p>Turning to the direction where the sound came from, Tyler and the others saw figures coming towards them.</p>

  <p>"They are coming," Tyler said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a clicking sound began to come from the fences beneath the tall platforms.</p>

  <p>The fences began to move, retracting into the ground. At the same time, all the sculpture-like Wights had become alive right there. They let out screams and rushed towards Tyler and the rest.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, one of the exiles was discouraged. He lifted the bow in his hand, ready to shoot and kill. Seeing this, Tyler rushed over to put his hand on the gear of the bow and stopped him. "Don't move!"</p>

  <p>As the Wights approached, they roared and suddenly rushed the opposite direction. It seemed that the smelly medicine worked.</p>

  <p>Tyler and the others let out a huge sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>However, on the other side, "They are coming again!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng, Emily and the others saw the Wights rushing over, they still remained composed.</p>

  <p>Everyone raised their weapons, ready for battle against the group of Wights.</p>

  <p>Because they had enough rest, everyone was pumping with adrenaline and energy. These Wights could hardly get close to them as they were quickly killed by the exiles.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!..."</p>

  <p>As everything became hectic, Emily was like a deft spirit, walking among the Wights. She used the saber as a prop, and it looked like she was dancing as she killed them one by one.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Luo Zheng's killing was no less efficient than hers. The two of them took the lead, killing off more than half of the Wights on their own.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were crazily killing, behind a high platform, several bows had already been quietly raised.</p>

  <p>Tyler, who ended up hiding in the darkness, aimed at Emily in the front, while the other three had locked their own targets.</p>

  <p>As soon as Tyler gave the order, everyone released their arrows in synchronization, "Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Several black arrows shot out, like black rain pouring out from the darkness.</p>
