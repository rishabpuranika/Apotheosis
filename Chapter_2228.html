<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>By now, Zheng's consecutive wins had quietly increased to twenty-six rounds and according to the rules of the arena, his point advantage was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only earned one point when he defeated Herman during the first round, but at the twenty-sixth round, he garnered one hundred and twenty points. At this point, he accumulated more than two thousand two hundred points.</p>

  <p>In a single round, he could only gain three to six points at most. The reason Luo Zheng could accumulate so many points at a time was that his wins were consistent all throughout. He was winning rounds in a row, and this gave him point advantage.</p>

  <p>Although the woman behind Luo Zheng was a low-rank True God, she had merely accumulated eight hundred points so far. Seeing Zheng's undefeated record and the number of points he had made her feel lightheaded, as if she were in a dream.</p>

  <p>Initially, the woman planned to rest for the meantime, but she decided against it. She wanted to see with her own eyes how Luo Zheng had accumulated more than two thousand points.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the points of a proving godly warrior would be zero to six hundred, while the points of a low-rank True God would be 600 to 2, 000, and the points of a mid-rank True God would be 2, 000 to 8, 000.</p>

  <p>For some reason, the points of a top-rank True God and a consummate True God were insanely high, and some consummate True Gods could get as many as hundreds of thousands of points. There were some cases where they even reached millions.</p>

  <p>At times, after entering the Arena of Legends for the first time, many talents who came from wealthy clans on the Floating Islands were able to gain points through consecutive victories. Luo Zheng had won twenty-six consecutive wins, while his points totaled to those of a mid-rank True God!</p>

  <p>However, the points accumulated like this were quite faulty on a particular level. After winning consecutively, a warrior could backfire and lose most of their points if they lost in just one battle. Moreover, especially in the Arena of Legends, no one was ever guaranteed a victory.</p>

  <p>After a few rounds, Luo Zheng had no idea that his own score began to attract the attention of others. Right after he activated his jade token, he fell into the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>"Gina, what are you looking at?"</p>

  <p>Another woman noticed the woman lost in her tracks and asked her out of concern.</p>

  <p>The woman, Gina pointed loosely at Luo Zheng. Her companion looked that way and was immediately shocked. "Oh my God!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-six consecutive wins, and more than two thousand points!"</p>

  <p>As a proving godly warrior, it was shocking to see that he had over two thousand points. This was not something people saw very often, so it attracted a lot of attention. Moreover, it had not been long after Luo Zheng entered the Purple Soul Hall. The other warriors like him had only earned tens of points, but he was an exception.</p>

  <p>Her exclamation garnered more and more attention, and this drew people to gather around and focus on Zheng's impossible records.</p>

  <p>"Two thousand points. These are a lot, but what if they don't last?" said someone from the crowd.</p>

  <p>After all, everyone knew that nothing was a sure win in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't lost yet and his points are all because of his consecutive wins," another expressed. "Once he loses a battle, he will lose most of his points, and he will be ranked pretty poorly."</p>

  <p>"I'm curious about how many more battles he will win in a row. I'm sure the opponents at this point are the best of the best!"</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng's points were so high, everyone knew that it didn't matter because he wasn't ranked yet. His performance hadn't attracted any attention from others on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Arena of Legends, if a warrior kept winning, they couldn't be ranked yet. Because Luo Zheng was on a winning streak, he still wasn't listed on the ranks. The vast majority of people present didn't know that there was a proving godly warrior in the Purple Soul Hall, who had won twenty-six matches in a row, and had accumulated more than two thousand points.</p>

  <p>Eventually, all the weaker godly warriors were ruled out and the competition remained amongst the strongest of the strong. However, with Zheng's notable strength, it was almost impossible for any of the proving godly warriors to defeat him. Because of this, Zheng's ball kept rolling as he won battles left and right.</p>

  <p>In the 27th round, people were anticipating with their eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-six consecutive wins! More than two thousand points! If I win, my points will double for sure." A voice of a man came. Just then, a figure slowly descended from the sky and smiled faintly at Luo Zheng on the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng's opponent looked around twenty-six or seven years old, with a pair of slender eyebrows and a pointed nose. He looked delicate, but his eyes gave off a tinge of malice and evil.</p>

  <p>"Is your surname Mu? Are you from the Mu Clan?" In the previous competitions, Luo Zheng rarely got the information about his opponents. He was too intrigued not to ask this time.</p>

  <p>This young man was called Grover Mu. He had won six consecutive wins, and accumulated more than 1, 200 points in total. Overall, you could say he was an excellent warrior, and Luo Zheng reckoned that he should be very important in the Mu Clan as well.</p>

  <p>"Humph, I'm curious," said Grover Mu. "Since you have won twenty-six matches in a row, why don't you know me?" He stared at Luo Zheng with a hint of displeasure in his eyes, as if Luo Zheng not knowing his identity was a mortal sin.</p>

  <p>"I know now," Luo Zheng replied indifferently. Because of Murphy, he didn't really have a good impression on the Mu Clan, but he knew not to show any of his knowledge here. His goal was just to keep winning and earn the most points that he could.</p>

  <p>"Good to know," said Grover Mu along with a laugh. He floated elegantly towards Luo Zheng like a leaf caught in a gust of wind. With a gentle wave of his hands, two dim swords sprouted out of his hands and he pointed them at Zheng's neck in a strange angle.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's twenty plus matches, his opponents were growing more and more creative. They had to do this to catch Luo Zheng off guard.</p>

  <p>Although these opponents hadn't mastered the Godly Way or condensed Godly Tile yet, they either had great martial arts skills, or the ability to exert the highest level of the internal momentum of the Godly Way. With their strength alone, they were far beyond the world lords that Luo Zheng had met in the Evolutionary Universe!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had just entered the divine land, he had met some world lords who were also proving godly warriors. He was surprised to witness their weaknesses because they were unlike anything he had ever heard of before. However, the upper-ranked proving godly warriors gradually changed his impression as they proved to be a lot stronger than Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for them, Zheng's current strength had exceeded his past strength. No matter how powerful a proving godly warrior had come to be, it would always be nearly impossible for any of them to defeat him.</p>

  <p>Facing the two short swords that came at him from either side, one from the left and one from the right, Luo Zheng didn't even dodge them. Instead of avoiding the swords, he charged forward with all his might.</p>

  <p>"Wow, you are confident! To me, it seems that you're quite ordinary,"</p>

  <p>Grover Mu grinned maliciously.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the two small swords in his hands began to move in the air. The originally dull swords began to dazzle and sparkle with a silver light emitting from them. The silver light continued to cross each other, and it was aiming towards Zheng's head!</p>

  <p>Silver Scales Slash was a skill created by Murphy himself.</p>

  <p>True Gods didn't need this martial skill because all they had to use was the Godly Way. In essence, it was obvious that Murphy crafted this skill especially for Grover Mu.</p>

  <p>Murphy had even had Grover Mu's two short swords made for him, too.</p>

  <p>The left one was called White Fur, and the right one was called Silver Scales. These two swords were supreme primordial weapons tailor-made for Grover Mu. Did Murphy really love Grover Mu this much?</p>

  <p>Grover Mu had fought at least a thousand battles in the Arena of Legends. Much like Luo Zheng, when he had just entered the arena, he was undefeated in battle. He had won twenty-one matches consecutively, and only after being defeated in the twenty-second round had he been given an official rank.</p>

  <p>In the thousand battles of Grover Mu, no one could ever save themselves from the Silver Scales Slash.</p>

  <p>Therefore, seeing that Luo Zheng didn't try to avoid the swords, he was immediately stunned. If Tianxing had seen enough of the world, he would have known the great power of his Silver Scales Slash, and he wouldn't have just stood there and offered himself up for death.</p>

  <p>However, when the silver light that Grover Mu waved was one foot away from Luo Zheng, he finally jolted out of his place.</p>

  <p>His body tensed up as he moved backwards, avoiding the silver light. At the same time, he stretched out his hands all of a sudden and took the light by his own hands.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>The white light sliced Zheng's hands, making satisfying, crisp sounds. The swords were short, but extremely sharp. However, the Silver Scales Slash just left a few white marks on Zheng's hands while it was supposed to do more damage.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng blocked the rotation of the two short swords, he took advantage of the situation to grab Grover Mu's hands and stop him.</p>

  <p>Grover Mu hadn't expected Luo Zheng to break his move in such a simple manner. His jaw dropped and he had no clue what to do.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he also began to feel a huge surge of energy go through his fingers, up to his palms, and upwards his arms!</p>
