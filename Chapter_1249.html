<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1249 An Appointment For A Fight </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Ning Yudie quietly sat in her seat, seemingly detached from all that was happening around her.</p>

  <p>However, Imogen continuously attacked Mu Ning verbally and the argument had now taken a nasty turn.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had initially been very obedient and silent when she was with Luo Zheng but the insults thrown at her right now were too much. Imogen might be a Life and Death Realm master but Mu Ning felt no fear. She had her great-grandfather beside her, after all.</p>

  <p>"Master Imogen, you said I'm not worthy of Luo Zheng but so what?" she said stubbornly. "Although Luo Zheng and I haven't officially gotten married, we've already done everything that a wife and husband are supposed to do!"</p>

  <p>Her words plunged the entire hall into an uncomfortable silence.</p>

  <p>A cup of top-grade, hundred-year-old wine sat untouched in front of Ning Yudie but the moment Mu Ning spoke, she extended her jade-like fingers and downed the alcohol in one gulp. Her cultivation assured her that she would never get drunk but the strong taste still made her face flush, "Shameless," she muttered coldly.</p>

  <p>Sex was not a taboo subject in the martial arts world but the way Mu Ning boldly announced it to the entire Cloud Hall was a bit crass and insensitive.</p>

  <p>Yudie's remark made Xander fly into a rage. "How can you speak like that…"</p>

  <p>Of course, Imogen wasn't just going to let an outsider chide Ning Yudie in their own territory. Not long after, the silence had once again plunged into a chaos of sharp words and nasty arguments.</p>

  <p>Not even Dillon, who was an exceptional mediator, could settle the two parties' differences. This confrontation went on for quite a long time before ending with Mu Ning issuing a challenge to Ning Yudie for a fight.</p>

  <p>"The location of the fight is in Cloudy City?" Luo Zheng asked after Dillon told him the whole story.</p>

  <p>Dillon nodded with certainty, "Yes. It's in Cloudy City!" The moment Dillon confirmed the location, Luo Zheng was already on the move and immediately dashed towards the portal to Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>From the perspective of the World Commercial Alliance, the issue could've been solved peacefully, with no need for a formal challenge to a fight. For them, it was better that everyone prioritized settling their differences and living harmoniously.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't their place, and besides, Luo Zheng had already returned. Perhaps he was the key to resolving this conflict once and for all.</p>

  <p>Once he entered the portal of the Oracle City, Luo Zheng swiftly flew through the channel headed towards Cloudy City. With his fast skilled bodily movement, it only took him a very short time to reach the other end of the channel.</p>

  <p>Swish…</p>

  <p>There was a flash of white light as Zheng's figure emerged from the transmission array and into Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>Several guards were stationed around the transmission array of the Cloudy City. The Heavenly Evil Sect might have been wiped out but all major cities remained on high alert and all main cities were heavily guarded. Anyone who came in or out must have a token or, in the case of merchants, special documents issued by the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sudden arrival alerted the several Illuminating Soul Realm guards who immediately set out to identify him and his cultivation level. To their amazement, however, they found that they couldn't see through his cultivation level at all!</p>

  <p>They still had a job to do though, even if they knew Luo Zheng wasn't someone they should provoke. One of the guards braced himself and set out to fulfill his duty. "Excuse me, you are…"</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng was already too anxious with the imminent fight between Mu Ning and Ning Yudie to bother with these guards and their insignificant questions. He ignored them and immediately flew towards his destination. The guards, on the other hand, were left in a daze since all it took was a brief flash for Luo Zheng to vanish from their sight.</p>

  <p>The dutiful guard immediately set out to sound an alarm but his colleague stopped him, "There's no need."</p>

  <p>"Why? We can't just let a stranger break into Cloudy City…" the dutiful guard asked with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>However, his colleague shook his head. "That's no stranger. That's Luo Zheng from Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>The dutiful guard's eyes widened in shock, "That's Luo Zheng?!" He then looked up to the sky where Luo Zheng had vanished but there was no trace of him.</p>

  <p>Above Cloudy City were several Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors, along with a few Life and Death Realm masters like Ning Yudie and Xander.</p>

  <p>These people could be considered as the top warriors within the Central Region who were now head to head all because of one man. This was probably the first time this had happened in the history of the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>Yudie's strength had greatly increased when she entered the Life and Death Realm. Even if she was only at the first level of the Life and Death Realm, she was strong enough to take on a second or even a third level Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was only at the Internal Elixir Realm. Internal Elixir Realm warriors were common to be seen in the many sects of the Central Region, but her Purple Power Body was exceptionally strong. Her abilities not only included getting help in the form of huge swords from the Purple Power World. She also had a terrifying ability to summon the true spirit that could lay waste to both heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>If this battle reached a point of life and death, it could spell disaster for everyone.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie herself had witnessed how Mu Ning summoned countless giant swords that chopped hundreds of thousands of Heavenly Evil Sect's independent warriors into mincemeat. Many of the casualties had been Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors. She knew better than to take this battle lightly.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Ning Yudie never expected to find herself in a battle just for a man.</p>

  <p>But this was Luo Zheng… Just thinking of his kiss made her feel warm inside.</p>

  <p>How could she share him with others?</p>

  <p>Swish…</p>

  <p>The two of them faced against each other as a gentle wind swept over the battle arena. The ice phoenix's feathers fell behind Ning Yudie whose eyes flashed with a fierce icy light. A large, mysterious ice halberd appeared in her hands.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, on the other hand, stood not too far away. A stubborn Mu Ning exuded from the young girl, indicating her persistence and determination to win this fight. Ning Yudie knew she had no choice but to be merciless for Mu Ning to know her position.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was only an Internal Elixir Realm warrior, facing against a Life and Death Realm master, yet she remained calm in the face of adversity.</p>

  <p>Her determination to stay with Luo Zheng gave her the strength and courage to face Ning Yudie and she would do whatever it took to achieve her goal.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning truly did not expect anything when it came to Zheng's love, unlike Ning Yudie. She knew he would never love her back whole-heartedly and she had no qualms sharing him with other women. All she really wanted was to stay by his side.</p>

  <p>With Ning Yudie arming herself with her mysterious ice halberd, Mu Ning extended her hand and countless ripples suddenly began to appear in the sky. True to her signature, huge swords from the Purple Power World had pierced through the clouds in her aid.</p>

  <p>Whoosh— Just as the battle was set to formally begin, a figure suddenly shot forward with incredible speed and stood between the two ladies.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was calm and there was a gentle smile on his face. He looked at Mu Ning and then at Ning Yudie. "What are you ladies doing?" he asked, pretending as if he didn't know anything.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>The sight of the young man filled Margaret's heart with relief. She really didn't want to fight with Ning Yudie to begin with and the huge swords from the sky immediately vanished as she ran towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie was still on guard, her mysterious ice halberd pointed at Mu Ning as she stared at Luo Zheng. She would never do something so brazen like throwing herself into a man's arms, just as Mu Ning did just now, but there was an evident trace of sadness in her eyes as she looked at the scene.</p>

  <p>Huge smiles broke out from both Xander and Brent when they saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They both greeted Luo Zheng with smiles.</p>

  <p>Brent, the Ethereal Spirit Sect's top talent, had always wanted to challenge Luo Zheng but never really got the chance. Still, he called him "brother-in-law."</p>

  <p>Imogen's face quickly twisted in anger when she heard it, letting out a cold, obvious snort to indicate her displeasure.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly turned his attention to her and cupped his hands. "Master Imogen, I heard that you've recently returned from overseas.</p>

  <p>Congratulations! I'm very happy to see you."</p>

  <p>Imogen tutted, "Are you really happy? I think you must have wished I died when I was away overseas!" Imogen had always thought highly of Luo Zheng but his relationship with Mu Ning made her furious at the young man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, retained the smile on his face knowing that resolving the conflict between the two ladies was the most important thing on the agenda. Since Imogen was clearly on Yudie's side, of course she would be hostile to him.</p>

  <p>As for Ning Yudie, she remained as still as an exquisite ice statue but the moment she looked at Margaret's face, a cold chill surfaced on her face.</p>
