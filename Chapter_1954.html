  <p>
</p>

  <p>There weren't cultivation methods like the Thunderbolt Annihilation in the Murphy Universe. Murphy, the creator of the Murphy Universe, was extremely strict in controlling the Heavenly Tribulations in the universe, which was why the warriors of the Sacred race all looked at each other in confusion when they saw the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>They had no idea it was triggered by Luo Zheng's cultivation method. They even wondered whether Luo Luo Zheng had made a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>"Holy crap!" a warrior cursed. "We must stop the Heavenly Tribulation!"</p>

  <p>"Without the protection of the enchanted barrier, the Blood Curse Array is too weak!" another shouted.</p>

  <p>The Thunderbolt Annihilation was a special cultivation method which when used, allowed the user to communicate with the heavens to induce the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>And once the Heavenly Tribulation was started, the whole process could not be stopped or reversed. Luo Luo Zheng himself was unable to stop it, so what chance did the other world lords have?</p>

  <p>And more than that, their time was running out.</p>

  <p>CRACK!</p>

  <p>Lightning flashed across the whole Blood Curse Array followed by consecutive crashes of thunder.</p>

  <p>The one hundred thousand divine textures in the Blood Curse Array were very precise and fragile. They were closely related to each other and the tiniest damage could lead to the collapse of the whole array.</p>

  <p>Without the protection of the enchanted barrier, how could the divine textures withstand the raging storm?</p>

  <p>In an instant, half of the divine textures caught fire and the Blood Curse Array above the blood pool was destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Blood Curse Array had originally been extracting blood from the blood pool, transforming it into a blood column and sending it to the bloody disc in the sky. However, as soon as the column that stretched to sky lost its support, it collapsed to the side and fell into the city, bathing the place with blood.</p>

  <p>Looking at the destroyed Blood Curse Array sent shivers down the spines of the present world lords of the Sacred race. It was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>The Blood Curse Array was destroyed just like that!</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" Raleign's face drastically changed.</p>

  <p>Since the Four Images Time Barrier was destroyed, the other three blood pools were also exposed to the air. Add to that, Luo Luo Zheng had also disappeared.</p>

  <p>They initially thought that he escaped, but from the looks of it, he must have gone to destroy the other blood pools.</p>

  <p>Leacock's expression was a mirror of Raleign's. Without a word, he used the Grand Teleportation and rushed toward the blood pool in the northern part of the city.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng also used the Grand Teleportation, the world lords didn't know where he went and the two grand world lords could only take their chances. The two of them chose a blood pool each to investigate while the rest of the world lords scrammed to the blood pool in the west.</p>

  <p>Connie emerged from the blood pool and with a slight shake of her body, she rid herself of the blood that covered her. She looked at the destroyed Blood Curse Array and snorted. Raleign and Leacock did not listen to her so they deserved to suffer. If all the Blood Curse Arrays were destroyed, the end of these two grand world lords would be quite miserable.</p>

  <p>But this had nothing to do with her.</p>

  <p>Connie had just become a world lord and she had come to the Seven Ultimate World to gain experience. Even if the senior leaders of the Sacred race were to punish them, this had nothing to do with her.</p>

  <p>"That human lad..." Connie murmured as she sat beside the blood pool.</p>

  <p>Did that human really have such power? Was he more powerful than Maha?</p>

  <p>The thought reminded Connie that Maha would come so she raised her message token and called out to him. "Maha! Are you on the way?"</p>

  <p>Maha was not far away. There were only three supreme worlds between the Matchless World and the Seven Ultimate World. However, if Maha wanted to go to the Seven Ultimate World, he couldn't do it in a short time.</p>

  <p>"Just give me some more time, Connie," Maha replied anxiously. "I'm almost there."</p>

  <p>"If you don't get here soon, that human brat will get away!" Connie teased.</p>

  <p>"Get away? Not gonna happen!" Maha laughed. He did not come alone.</p>

  <p>Murphy's orders were clear. The Sacred race attached great importance to the ten Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe. Besides Maha, there were also two Supreme Lords. They all raced to the Seven Ultimate World at a breakneck speed. It would be a miracle if Luo Luo Zheng managed to slip from their hands.</p>

  <p>The only reason Maha was anxious was because he wanted to be the one to finish Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the two grand world lords flew to the blood pools in the north and east and saw that the surrounding areas were empty, they knew they made a wrong choice. With a grit of their teeth, they immediately transformed into two rays of light and sped toward the blood pool in the west of the city.</p>

  <p>After one became a world lord, their comprehension of the Space Law reached the ninth layer and they would be able to use the Grand Teleportation. However, one could not use the Grand Teleportation without any limitation. Raleign, for instance, had to rest for 150 seconds after using it.</p>

  <p>The two grand world lords, however, were too anxious to rest so they chose to fly to the west of the city.</p>

  <p>The other six world lords had chosen to move to the blood pool in the west. One of them, the fastest, got there before anyone else.</p>

  <p>When he popped from the space, his eyes just circled the area when suddenly, he felt a strange killing intent behind him.</p>

  <p>His expression morphed into one of horror.</p>

  <p>Before he could turn around, a sharp pain stabbed his back.</p>

  <p>'My Crimson Snow Cloak!'</p>

  <p>As his eyesight dulled, a thought flashed in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had once made a great contribution and as a reward, he was given the Crimson Snow Cloak by a Supreme Lord. Defensive treasures were extremely rare and the cloak, a supreme divine weapon, had saved his life countless times.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that his opponent was Luo Luo Zheng. This kind of treasure was powerful but it couldn't protect him completely.</p>

  <p>With one punch, Luo Luo Zheng tore through the Crimson Snow Cloak and the world lord's internal organs were smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>The world lord, like a fallen leaf, swayed and fell into the blood pool.</p>

  <p>The Blood Curse Array was so close but Luo Luo Zheng was not in a hurry to destroy it.</p>

  <p>In fact, he decided to stay and wait.</p>

  <p>When a world lord moved across space, strong spatial fluctuations were produced and these fluctuations would be the ones to tell Luo Luo Zheng the direction of the world lord. That way, he could easily catch his opponent.</p>

  <p>When two world lords using the Grand Teleportation to chase one another, the person escaping would be at an advantage since he'd be able to feel the spatial fluctuations which he could use to identify where his opponent would appear.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Luo Zheng killed the world lord of the Sacred race by ambushing him.</p>

  <p>Tens of feet from him, the Space Law began to fluctuate, signaling the arrival of the second world lord.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng moved toward the ripples and waited to attack.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The world lord nearly collided with Luo Luo Zheng as he drilled out of the space crack. Now, the two faced each other, only inches apart.</p>

  <p>He didn't think Luo Luo Zheng would dare to ambush him, but quite obviously, he thought wrong. Another thing he didn't expect was the smile on Luo Zheng's face as he pulled back his fist, ready to punch.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Just like that, the world lord fell to the ground in a lifeless heap.</p>

  <p>With the rays of light of Space Law flashing one after another, Luo Luo Zheng moved quickly in the air. He'd kill all the world lords that dared to appear.</p>

  <p>Below, warriors of the Sacred race as well as mortals with low cultivation levels were looking intently at the sky. Some of them were nature creatures, and some were Illuminating Soul Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the warriors of the Sacred race were invincible.</p>

  <p>But why couldn't they fight off the young human?</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng killed world lord after world lord, he saw a ray of black light and a ray of white light flashing in the sky, signaling the arrival of the two grand world lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grinned as he slowly escaped into the Blood Curse Array. With a circle of light spreading out under his feet, Luo Luo Zheng activated the Thunderbolt Annihilation and teleported to the next blood pool.</p>

  <p>"Quick! Use the lightning-introducing stone!" Veins stood out on Leacock's face as he roared at Releign.</p>

  <p>This seemed to turn on a switch in Raleign's head as he suddenly remembered that he had a stone that could absorb thunder. In his panic, he had forgotten all about it.</p>

  <p>"I'll go after the human brat! You activate the stone!" With that, Leacock teleported to another blood pool in the city.</p>

  <p>Raleign was on the verge of exploding. Right now, he wanted nothing more than to kill Luo Luo Zheng. He wasn't interested in activating the stupid stone.</p>

  <p>"Why are you alone?" he snapped at the lone world lord beside him.</p>

  <p>"Where are the others?"</p>

  <p>The world lord pointed to the blood pool where several bodies were falling in.</p>

  <p>Raleign's eyes widened. He didn't expect that in such little time, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to kill several world lords of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>His eyes were red because of anger. He was burning with a frenzy of rage. He threw the lightning-introducing stone at the world lord and spat,</p>

  <p>"You activate the stone. I'll go help Leacock."</p>

  <p>He teleported away, leaving the world lord alone with the lightning-introducing stone. The world lord glanced at the stone in his hand and looked at the brewing Heavenly Tribulation in the sky. "I don't know how to use the lightning-introducing stone," he murmured.</p>

  <p>    </p>
