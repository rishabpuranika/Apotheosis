  <p>
</p>

  <p>How many people in the Central Region dared to confront Eddie?</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng wasn't willing to face Eddie. He would be a fool if he messed with a warrior at the Life and Death Realm for no reason at all.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had no other choice. Ever since Eddie had taken Yan away, the fight between him and Eddie had escalated to the point where there was now no room for compromise.</p>

  <p>And so, when Luo Luo Zheng encountered Eddie, he couldn't help but utter those words. Since begging was useless and he had to rely on his own fists to save Yan, he might as well fight to the death.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, this was Luo Zheng's way of cultivation.</p>

  <p>After Eddie left, the story of the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array spread throughout the Central Region.</p>

  <p>A sect-protecting array actually completely withstood Eddie's attack, and it even had the chance to kill him. This was simply unimaginable.</p>

  <p>What did this mean? This meant that in the Central Region, there was no sect or warrior that could put the Cloud Hall at risk. If there was a sect war, the Cloud Hall's losses would be the smallest. At this moment, the Cloud Hall could already be considered a fifth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>A runic expert had changed the fate of a fourth-grade sect. It looked like Luo Luo Zheng was destined to go down memorably in the history of the Central Region. At the very least, everyone was now certain that Luo Zheng's achievements in the area of runes were much greater than that of Arnold.</p>

  <p>In the following days, everyone in the Central Region would talk about Luo Luo Zheng and the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>"This time, Luo Luo Zheng will become a hot topic for all every sect in the Central Region!"</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw! Everyone in the Runic Tower was arrogant before. Now that we know Luo Luo Zheng is skillful in runes, will he be more arrogant than the people from the Runic Tower?"</p>

  <p>"Although Luo Zheng's runic skills are powerful, Eddie is not someone to be trifled with. Once Luo Luo Zheng leaves the Cloud Hall, he will die without the protection of the sect-protecting array!"</p>

  <p>It looked like people were discussing Luo Luo Zheng everywhere. This conversation happened in a bustling restaurant.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a tall warrior slapped the table and laughed. "That may not be so!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's talent can't be underestimated. As a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm, he could defeat a warrior at the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. Didn't you hear what he said to the Evil East Lord? 'I'll spare your life!' Haw-haw! How much courage does it take to say that?"</p>

  <p>"He's just hiding in that little turtle shell and playing around. If it weren't for the protection of the sect-protecting array, Eddie's finger would have crushed him," another gloomy voice retorted.</p>

  <p>"So what? Anyway, I think highly of Luo Luo Zheng! He has done so many amazing things. He is the epitome of miracles. He will be somebody one day!"</p>

  <p>All kinds of discussions and opinions were continuously exchanged among the warriors, including those of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>At the very least, the people of the Cloud Hall no longer saw Luo Luo Zheng as a disciple, nor did they see him as a steward. Instead, they treated him as someone comparable to an elder.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng might have offended Eddie, but he had used his own strength to drive him away. Who else in the Cloud Hall could do it?</p>

  <p>There was also another rumor that was doing the rounds which said that Luo Luo Zheng was Yudie's secret lover and that she was already pregnant with his baby. But this rumor was only spread out anonymously.</p>

  <p>Several days later came the annual Lantern Lighting Festival.</p>

  <p>As nightfall approached, the fiery red lights of the Cloudy City lit up.</p>

  <p>For ordinary people, this day was a lively holiday.</p>

  <p>Groups of children carried small lanterns through the streets, bringing a glimmer of light to every dark corner. The adults also needed to let the lamps float into the sky. It was said that this would bring good luck for the coming year.</p>

  <p>Countless lamps rose into the air. Many of them were blown by the wind into the massive enchanted barrier above the Cloud Hall, emitting a magnificent firelight.</p>

  <p>In addition to the lamps, people also had to kill chickens, slaughter cows, and entertain guests with a sumptuous feast. It was truly a lively scene.</p>

  <p>However, for warriors, this day was a special one.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the Dreamy Swampland of the Central Region, there was a thick fog all year round and a special kind of demonic beast called the Cloud-swallowing Beast. Its demonic core could be used to make a kind of elixir to extend one's years. So every year, countless warriors would make their way into the Dreamy Swampland.</p>

  <p>There were many things to be gained in the Dreamy Swampland. Every year, there would be warriors that would obtain great benefits over there.</p>

  <p>But countless warriors also perished there every year.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm were not qualified to enter, while warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm could only go three hundred miles into the Dreamy Swampland. Even warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm could only go eight hundred miles deep. It was dangerous enough that even the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm could perish if they went further. A thousand miles deep into the Dreamy Swampland was an unfathomable place.</p>

  <p>There was still no record of what lay 1, 500 miles into the Dreamy Swampland. It could be described as extremely uninhabited.</p>

  <p>There was a huge black quagmire there, devoid of any ripples and looking dead.</p>

  <p>At the edge of this black quagmire was a small thatched hut, and someone actually lived here. This thatched hut was extremely simple and crude.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a short man walked out of the thatched hut. He was a warrior at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>There were very few warriors at the Life and Death Realm within the Central Region. But nobody knew this man, a warrior hidden away from the world.</p>

  <p>He looked at the gradually darkening sky and muttered, "Is it the Lantern Lighting Festival again? I've lit the enchanted lamp seventy-seven times. I wonder if my dream will come true this year."</p>

  <p>The enchanted lamps would be lit on the Lantern Lighting Festival. He had lit the enchanted lamp seventy-seven times, which meant that he had waited for seventy-seven years.</p>

  <p>He took out an unremarkable oil lamp from behind him and gently stroked it with his hand. A bewitching red flame appeared at the tip of his finger that he gently rubbed onto the enchanted lamp.</p>

  <p>A faint yellow light bloomed from it.</p>

  <p>There were nine tiny marks on the lamp, six of which had already been lit.</p>

  <p>The man looked at the six lit marks with a smile on his face. Only when all the nine marks had lit up could he enter the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Last year, eight marks had lit up. Would the last mark light up as well this year?</p>

  <p>In an exquisite pavilion at the World Commercial Alliance's headquarters, Dillon, Hobbes and Haber were gathered together. Before them was an enchanted lamp too. They were still waiting for someone.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance slowly descended onto the pavilion. He said to Dillon, "Just light it, and gather the elders of the World Commercial Alliance."</p>

  <p>Hobbes looked surprised. "You mean, the ninth enchanted lamp..."</p>

  <p>The Ancient Tycoon nodded and said, "That's right, I've calculated it once, and I have a strong premonition that the ninth enchanted lamp has already appeared. It's just that I don't know who has it, which is why I asked you to send out the invitations and urge them to light it as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>"Then let's hurry up!" Hobbes was a short-tempered man. He stood up and lightly patted the enchanted lamp. A flame shot out and ignited it. A seventh mark appeared on the enchanted lamp.</p>

  <p>The taciturn Haber nodded and said, "It's quite fast this year. The eighth mark had lit up at midnight last year. I had almost thought that the person with the eighth enchanted lamp had given up!"</p>

  <p>"Hopefully, we can make it. I'll go gather the elders," Dillon said with a smile as he looked at the marks on the lamp.</p>

  <p>On a small island in the endless South Sea, Eddie also took out his enchanted lamp and studied it closely. He had already made preparations for this trip to the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>He sat at the top of a big tree on the island, and around the trunk were six cloaked warriors. These were powerful warriors at the middle and late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and they were all willing to follow Eddie until their deaths to help him establish his divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>Eddie had to bring them along on the journey to the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>However, Eddie wasn't sure if the final enchanted lamp would be lit. He focused on lighting up his own small enchanted lamp, and the eighth mark lit up as well.</p>

  <p>Eddie looked at the faint yellow mark on the small lamp, and mumbled, "I wonder if the last mark will light up this evening."</p>
