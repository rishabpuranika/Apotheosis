  <p>
</p>

  <p>Samuel was slightly shocked by the scene that greeted him when he appeared on the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>He immediately released his spiritual sense and found that the whole Floating Island was empty.</p>

  <p>The majority of the Dongfang Clan's members were gone; only a few hundred people in front of him were left.</p>

  <p>His face immediately darkened.</p>

  <p>Only moments ago, he had incited the disciples of the Han Clan to plunder and destroy the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>He had never anticipated that the Dongfang Clan's members would leave without any trace as if they had foreseen his plot. His first fear was that a large amount of wealth of the Dongfang Clan would also have been taken away.</p>

  <p>Before he could react, Pierson spoke, "Most of the disciples of our Dongfang Clan have gone back to the Ray Tree. Only 573 of us have remained behind. All the magic weapons, divine might coins, pills, arrays, and classics of the Dongfang Clan have been left behind as well. All our wealth and even the lives of 573 people here will be handed over to you.</p>

  <p>We only hope that you can let our Dongfang Clan off this time."</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the Dongfang Clan was in the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>As long as the Ray Tree existed, the Dongfang Clan could be called a powerful clan even if its Floating Island was destroyed.</p>

  <p>After all, the Dongfang Clan had some unknown and powerful warriors apart from Pierson.</p>

  <p>While Pierson spoke, the rest of the warriors of the Dongfang Clan, including Winthrop, stared ahead with a calm expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>They had become death warriors not to fight against Samuel, but to appease his anger with their lives.</p>

  <p>Samuel looked at Pierson in surprise and sneered, "Do you think I will let off the Dongfang Clan just because a few hundred of you willingly hand over your lives? In the past, everyone on the Yue Clan's Floating Island was also slaughtered cruelly. Killing just a few hundred of you will not be enough for me to take revenge!"</p>

  <p>When the Dongfang Clan's members heard this, their faces suddenly turned pale.</p>

  <p>Pierson's eyes were filled with pain. Gritting his teeth, he suddenly knelt down in front of Samuel and hit his head against the cyan bricks so hard that he immediately smashed them. "Please forgive our Dongfang Clan's crimes!"</p>

  <p>Pierson was a well-known and respected Holy Being in the divine land, but now, he was conceding to Samuel and throwing away all his dignity and self-respect in order to save the future of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>The other disciples of the Dongfang Clan had bulging veins on their faces when they watched Pierson do that.</p>

  <p>Until a month ago, the Dongfang Clan had been a noble and powerful clan.</p>

  <p>But now, Pierson, a Holy Being of their clan who had been living in seclusion, was kneeling down before Samuel! It was humiliating for their whole clan, but there was nothing they could do about it.</p>

  <p>The hundreds of warriors who had remained behind were not afraid of death. For them, the continuity of the Dongfang Clan was far more important and worth sacrificing themselves for.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang...</p>

  <p>One by one, the disciples of the Dongfang Clan lowered their heads, knelt down, and knocked their heads against the cyan bricks, which immediately cracked under the pressure.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel continued to look indifferent as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening in front of him.</p>

  <p>Rosie, however, couldn't stand to watch the scene any longer, so she said coldly, "Now that the Dongfang Clan has given up their Floating Island and offered these warriors as a sacrifice, can't you forgive them?"</p>

  <p>Samuel glanced at Rosie and said with a sneer, "If the Yellow Emperor Guards kneel down in front of your Nine Li race, will you forgive them?"</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race had deep enmity with the Yellow Emperor Guards, and they couldn't tolerate the fact that their race had been exterminated.</p>

  <p>Rosie was stunned into silence for a few moments. Finally, she bit her lips and said, "That is a different situation..."</p>

  <p>"Different? Ha-ha..." Samuel erupted into wild laughter. Then, he continued, "In my previous life, the Stone Mouse and I were as close as brothers. My wife and I loved each other very much. My son was a young talent, a promising man with unlimited prospects. Our Yue Clan had three thousand masters, and one hundred thousand disciples... And all of us were killed by Nicholas! How can such a hatred be wiped off by killing just a few hundred warriors? How can they expect a Floating Island to be enough to appease me? How can they ever think that I will forgive them? It is so silly to do that!"</p>

  <p>Even the disciples of the Han Clan were stunned to hear these words.</p>

  <p>During recent decades, it had often been said that Samuel's temperament had changed a lot, almost as if he had become another person. However, no one had known the reason for this, not even Alfredo.</p>

  <p>But now, after hearing Samuel mention his previous life, they found that things were finally starting to make sense...</p>

  <p>"His previous life, the Yue Clan? So our Holy Emperor is... Gregorio's reincarnation?"</p>

  <p>At first, Alfredo found Samuel's words inconceivable, but then he recalled reading about Gregorio and the Stone Mouse in a book.</p>

  <p>Although the Yue Clan had been destroyed, there were records of them in the classics. Soon, Alfredo understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>In fact, after Luo Zheng and Master Evil had released the Stone Mouse, the mouse had awakened Samuel's memory of his previous life. The real Samuel was actually already "dead"; in his place was Gregorio.</p>

  <p>Samuel's body was now just a vessel for Gregorio.</p>

  <p>Pascal, Liusu, and Aleyna actually didn't mean anything to him anymore. He just saw them as chess pieces to take revenge.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't feel bad even if the whole Han Clan was destroyed.</p>

  <p>Rosie, too, was rendered speechless by his speech.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang...</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan's members remained kneeling down and kept hitting their heads against the ground.</p>

  <p>All the while, more and more disciples of the Han Clan passed through the space channel and came to the Dongfang Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>So far, the only reason all the disciples of the Han Clan who had gathered here were waiting patiently was because they were afraid of Pierson and the others.</p>

  <p>However, as more and more disciples appeared, they began to get impatient.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted, "You old bastard, if you want to die, then just die as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>After you die, you will not know whether the Dongfang Clan is destroyed or not."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you don't have to worry about what happens after you die anyway!" another person in the crowd added.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Han Clan didn't care about the Dongfang Clan's fate at all.</p>

  <p>They had enthusiastically followed Samuel here so that they could plunder this Floating Island. After all, Nicholas was dead, so they had no scruples.</p>

  <p>Besides, many of them thought that the Dongfang Clan should be exterminated.</p>

  <p>Although a portion of the disciples from the Han Clan sympathized with the Dongfang Clan, they were unwilling to stand up for them. Even if they wanted to, they had no qualifications to do that.</p>

  <p>Hearing the words of the disciples, Samuel said to Pierson, "If you ask for death, I will agree. But I will never let off the Dongfang Clan! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was already under his control, and now, he felt like the entire divine land was, too. When he would destroy the Ray Tree would depend on his mood.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Pascal flew toward the Dongfang Clan's members with the pair of black wings spreading out behind him.</p>

  <p>The wings exuded a terrifying momentum. As Pascal flew over the death warriors of the Dongfang Clan, all the flesh and blood in their bodies instantly collapsed and turned into powder.</p>

  <p>Even Pierson and Winthrop were killed in that way.</p>

  <p>Even at the last second, Pierson hadn't made any attempt to resist. He had just continued to kneel down on the ground.</p>
