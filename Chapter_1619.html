<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1619 The Overbearing Mu Ning (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was practically impossible to change the heavens' restrictions.</p>

  <p>In order to eliminate the restrictions, a small group of Supreme Lords were expected to first create the secret medicine for reincarnation at a great cost. Once it was created, the Supreme Lords were to drink it so that they might be reincarnated with their memories of their past lives.</p>

  <p>Everything would have started right back again at the beginning. It was only to their dismay, however, that once they reached the Life and Death Realm and successfully activated the Lotus Flower during the small Heavenly Tribulation, they were still unable to escape the restriction.</p>

  <p>All the various races attached great importance to the Illusion Battlefield and the ace talents.</p>

  <p>It was because they believed that maybe someone in this group of ace talents could ascend as a True God, which would allow them to go beyond the heavens!</p>

  <p>It was possible that one or two of the warriors in the Soul Sea Realm would become a new True God.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that there weren't any talented people at the Spirit Supreme Realm and Spirit Transformation Realm. It was just that, after this era began, all kinds of talents suddenly proliferated. And at present, these talents, whose age ranged from 20 to 40, had managed to reach the Soul Sea Realm, and continued to grow.</p>

  <p>The incredibly numerous amount of new talents made everyone know this generation as the "Golden Generation".</p>

  <p>The Snow Godly Way...</p>

  <p>Hannah...</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed vividly.</p>

  <p>This woman was most likely not of this grand era. Luo Zheng had never heard of her name before.</p>

  <p>But it was at this moment that Luo Zheng seized the opportunity to talk to her.</p>

  <p>He approached her casually and asked, "Where does one go after he becomes a True God, and thus, transcends the heavens?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already roughly understood that Yan was in a world above the universe. Although the mysterious girl swore to help him look for information about Yan, she hadn't really given him a sufficient answer.</p>

  <p>It was assumed that the young man who took Yan away was a True God.</p>

  <p>If he was, where could he have gone after he crossed the heavens?</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, they couldn't possibly be in the chaos.</p>

  <p>"The Endless Divine Land," the young woman suddenly replied next to him, snapping him out of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"The divine land!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng repeated, boring those words into his mind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the flowing river of ice stopped moving.</p>

  <p>The young woman placed her finger on the small bell in front of her, and poked it once again. The bell then started to shake again.</p>

  <p>The snowstorm stopped in an instant, and the entire world instantaneously sank into silence, as if it had just been through a harsh snowstorm in the past few weeks.</p>

  <p>Except for the young woman named Hannah, it was only Luo Zheng in this entire world. Everything he saw was just a vast expanse of whiteness.</p>

  <p>Just as he was trying to assess the situation, an invisible chill attacked Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>This chill crept right through Zheng's spine and it spread throughout his entire body. Luo Zheng could feel his soul freeze in an instant, and he felt absolutely powerless.</p>

  <p>What he felt was unbearable coldness!</p>

  <p>Not only did energy disappear at this freezing temperature, but absolutely every material thing seemed to disappear.</p>

  <p>However, within this space adorned by this strange temperature, the frozen ice and snow were somehow extremely warm for Luo Zheng. This was unlike anything he had ever felt.</p>

  <p>It took another five minutes before Luo Zheng could begin to feel the temperature rise again. The woman suddenly appeared behind him and sighed softly. "You don't fit in the Snow Godly Way..." she trailed off, and then, just as suddenly...</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>A ball of flames ignited in Zheng's mind!</p>

  <p>He calmed himself down by closing his eyes and taking deep breaths.</p>

  <p>Once he began to come back to his senses, he tried to open his eyes.</p>

  <p>However, everything suddenly disappeared. There was still a lamp hanging on a wall, but most of what he saw was in darkness. He squinted his eyes before suddenly seeing the illuminated Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>In the lamp, there was a small embossed mark. It was the mark of a True God!</p>

  <p>This experience was crucial for a warrior!</p>

  <p>Those who practiced the cultivation method with the ice attribute might be able to comprehend this situation fully. In such a freezing state, they might be able to learn something that was beneficial to their later cultivation.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Ning Yudie was not given the chance to enter here. She rigorously practiced the cultivation method with the ice attribute. Even though her chances were low to begin with, it still might have been possible for her to be compatible with the Snow Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The True God that Luo Zheng now knew as Hannah mentioned the Godly Tile just now, but he was oblivious to what it was like.</p>

  <p>If he could only return to the fairy palace, Luo Zheng would have been able to consult the Immortal Book about it.</p>

  <p>Of course, if he wanted to transcend the heavens to search for the divine land, this situation should be of great importance to him.</p>

  <p>After taking a few moments to think, Luo Zheng stepped out of the lamp's light and continued forward.</p>

  <p>Two steps in and something caught his attention fairly quickly. He saw some murals carved into the walls of the Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>The first mural depicted the birth of a little baby girl. It seemed to snow heavily that day. There was even a solar eclipse in the mural's sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked further and looked at the second mural. The baby girl grew a bit taller and was now starting to cultivate martial arts. It looked like she was trying to harness her ultimate strength.</p>

  <p>When he walked even further to look at the third mural, Luo Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>'I think I get it now. The life of this True God has been inscribed in the walls of this corridor.'</p>
