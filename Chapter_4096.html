  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had no idea what was happening in real life.</p>

  <p>But with his limited perception, he could still tell the good from the bad.</p>

  <p>Anyone would regret wanting to hurt him while trying to wake him up.</p>

  <p>The Thirteen Teeth Necklace floated through the dream smoothly. This time, the Monkey Spirit King didn't dodge anymore. Instead, he walked towards it and let it rest around his neck.</p>

  <p>As it did, the dream started to break with cracks growing from its edges.</p>

  <p>It was like a huge mirror being smashed by a strong force.</p>

  <p>The dream that trapped the Monkey Spirit King for more than one thousand chaotic eras was finally destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's eyelids moved as he struggled to open them.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters noticed and rushed towards him one after another.</p>

  <p>They stood on the water and stared at him with excitement.</p>

  <p>The moment his eyes opened, Manuel had led all the Monkey Masters to kneel on the water.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, my king!" they shouted as they welcomed the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Their voices echoed throughout the whole Night View Island.</p>

  <p>"You have fallen asleep for more than one thousand chaotic eras. I felt so sorry that I couldn't wake you up," Manuel said.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King sat straight and looked around the central lake as if he didn't hear what Manuel had said.</p>

  <p>For over a thousand chaotic eras, he had stayed motionless in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Now he felt like a prisoner released from prison, curious about everything outside.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>He suddenly stood from the water, carrying his huge body. He then leaped towards the top of a mountain, which only appeared as a small hill for his size.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because he was too excited that he jumped high once more.</p>

  <p>The power of the Monkey Spirit King's feet caused the small hill to crumble into thousands of pieces.</p>

  <p>"My king, stop doing that!" Manuel frighteningly warned as he saw the Monkey Spirit King flying into the air.</p>

  <p>The sky above the Night View Island was covered with Void Dust.</p>

  <p>If the Monkey Spirit King reached the Void Dust, he would be devoured.</p>

  <p>However, it was too late. The Monkey Spirit King had flown upward, causing his head to be eroded by the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The Void Dust quickly found its way to also devour his entire body.</p>

  <p>Surprised, the Monkey Spirit King fell, his feet stepping heavily on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The whole Night View Island shook at the impact that was almost the magnitude of an earthquake.</p>

  <p>Since the Monkey Spirit King had awakened, being devoured by the Void Dust wasn't a big deal.</p>

  <p>He could still be revived in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Manuel, what happened before I woke up?" asked the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>He encountered a huge threat in his dream and he had to investigate it.</p>

  <p>Manuel went forward and told the Monkey Spirit King what had recently happened to the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's eyes flared with resentment when he learned that Sewell had done all those things.</p>

  <p>In his dream, he had already judged that it was the doing of the Snake Spirit Sect. Now that he confirmed, he seethed with anger.</p>

  <p>"The corporeal body that I had been proud of has been destroyed, and they still want to take away my current body as a Treacherous Being. They are going too far!" the Monkey Spirit King roared.</p>

  <p>Manuel looked at him calmly.</p>

  <p>'His long slumber has not seemed to change his temperament at all, '</p>

  <p>Manuel thought.</p>

  <p>After the Monkey Spirit King had calmed down, Manuel revealed, "You escaped from harm and have finally awakened, but it was not because of us."</p>

  <p>"What? Then who could it be?" the Monkey Spirit King asked with surprise in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters were the most powerful soldiers under his command.</p>

  <p>Was there anyone else stronger than Manuel?</p>

  <p>"It's those humans," answered Manuel as he pointed to them. "They not only stopped Sewell from taking you away but also repaired the Thirteen Teeth Necklace."</p>

  <p>"Humans?" The Monkey Spirit King directed his eyes towards them and asked, "Are they the descendants of human spirits?"</p>

  <p>"They have a great connection with human spirits. They are considered human spirits born in the secondary world," replied Manuel.</p>

  <p>Many human spirits, snake spirits, monkey spirits, and bird spirits were born in the secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" The Monkey Spirit King paused. "You mean these humans have repaired the Thirteen Teeth Necklace?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>The Thirteen Teeth Necklace had already run out of its bloodline power.</p>

  <p>How did it regain the bloodline power?</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King got immersed in the joy of awakening that he did not realize it.</p>

  <p>Now that he deeply thought about it, he was startled.</p>

  <p>The only way to repair the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was to use the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Even if he brought the Thirteen Teeth Necklace to the Eternal Divine Courtyard, it would be difficult to repair it.</p>

  <p>Then how did they repair the wolf teeth in the Night View Island?</p>

  <p>It was also impossible!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was convinced that the Thirteen Teeth Necklace on his neck was not fake.</p>

  <p>That was why his face was painted with utmost shock.</p>

  <p>The human race stood on another mountain peak. They quietly observed what was happening.</p>

  <p>They saw the Monkey Spirit King's face clearly as he conversed with Manuel.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess analyzed the possible reactions and results, and they presumed that the situation was just fine.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was bold and generous. They believed that he was not willful nor cruel.</p>

  <p>They discussed in low voices and the Primeval Lord of Heaven already had an explanation in mind.</p>

  <p>However, the Monkey Spirit King was much more sensitive than the Primeval Lord of Heaven had imagined.</p>

  <p>He quickly noticed Luo Zheng who was standing at the back of the crowd.</p>

  <p>He stretched out a finger and pointed at Luo Zheng. "Come here," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't surprised at this.</p>

  <p>He was sure that the Monkey Spirit King would investigate the repair of the wolf teeth, yet he did not expect to be noticed only at a glance.</p>

  <p>Approaching the Monkey Spirit King, Luo Zheng bowed to him with clasped hands.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King looked at him with a grin across his face, while Manuel and the others were puzzled by what they saw.</p>

  <p>They knew that the one who had saved the Monkey Spirit King was Fuxi, and the one who had repaired the wolf teeth was the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>It was none of Luo Zheng's business.</p>

  <p>This young man did not come from the Ghost Mountain. He came from the outside not long ago.</p>

  <p>"Was it you who helped me wake up?" asked the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "It wasn't just me. We worked together to wake you up."</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King stared at Luo Zheng with great interest. "But they don't have the specific bloodline. What surprises me more is that it can only be kept in the sacred cup. Why could you use it? How did you do it?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Manuel and the others all looked at Luo Zheng in disbelief as they heard the Monkey Spirit King's words.</p>

  <p>The only bloodline that had to be kept in the sacred cup was the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>According to the Monkey Spirit King, Luo Zheng had the ancestry-level bloodline in his body!</p>

  <p>They suspected that the Monkey Spirit King could have made a mistake.</p>

  <p>Maybe he just talked nonsense.</p>

  <p>After all, it was impossible to inherit the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Four Spirits Sect was informed of this fact.</p>

  <p>Some people speculated that the ancestry-level bloodline could be replenished and there was a slight possibility of inheriting it, but it was impossible for even half of the light columns to light up.</p>

  <p>That legend was never real in the long history of the main world.</p>
