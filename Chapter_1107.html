<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1107 Luo Zheng's Speed of Comprehending Time Law </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wasn't that these powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm didn't believe it, but they found it hard to accept that Luo Luo Zheng had actually been learning the Time Law from Fiona.</p>

  <p>The Time Law of the four divine kingdoms was recorded on a totem.</p>

  <p>And the totem wasn't something that belonged to the Lower World but was passed down from the Upper World through the Reverse Spirit Channel of the secret sect.</p>

  <p>But this particular totem wasn't sought after a lot. In comparison, the totems that carried the third and fourth layers of Fire Law, and those that carried the Ice, Metal, and Thunder Laws were much more popular.</p>

  <p>The reason was simply because it was too difficult to comprehend the Time Law.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what the situation in the Upper World was like. But there were no more than one hundred warriors in the entirety of the four divine kingdoms who could comprehend the Time Law.</p>

  <p>For example, the female martial artist who had followed Randy, Camilla, didn't have any great talents in other aspects. But because she had comprehended 10% of the first layer of the Time Law, she had been able to reach the top of the second tier.</p>

  <p>Fiona's talent was good enough, but it took her seven years just to completely comprehend the first layer of the Time Law.</p>

  <p>It had taken her only nineteen years to reach the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. But it had taken her seven years just to comprehend the Time Law alone.</p>

  <p>Because of how difficult it was to comprehend the Time Law and also because it took too long a time, many martial artists usually gave up trying to study the Time Law from the totem. Some other warriors wanted to try their luck comprehending the Time Law on the totem but they ended up discovering that they didn't have any talent in this aspect.</p>

  <p>So they also eventually gave up.</p>

  <p>The Time Law was indeed powerful. It frustrated many warriors who achieved nothing despite having spent so much time trying to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>Of course, there were people with great perseverance in the Divine Kingdom Continent. There was once a martial artist at the Illuminating Soul Realm, a prince of the Star Field Divine Kingdom with divine-level talent. He was obsessed with studying the Time Law and after spending a full 563 years on it, he had finally comprehended 60% of the first layer of the Law.</p>

  <p>Since he had spent too much time studying the Time Law, he had only been able to reach the primary stage of the Internal Elixir Realm after becoming over five hundred years of age. He had finally died when he had reached the end of his lifespan.</p>

  <p>There were only two types of people that cultivated the Time Law on the Divine Kingdom Continent. The first type was the martial artists who had a very strong affinity to the Time Law. Even in the divine kingdoms where many talents usually gathered, there was only a small number of such talented martial artists. And in the younger generation, only Fiona was gifted in comprehending the Time Law.</p>

  <p>The other type was the mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Since they had already reached such a high level, they had nothing else to do. And since they couldn't ascend to the Upper World, they could only cultivate various laws or explore continents and lands abroad.</p>

  <p>They could take advantage of their long lifespans and spend a thousand years comprehending it. They could do it even if they didn't have a great affinity to the Time Law.</p>

  <p>That was why the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm couldn't accept what they saw.</p>

  <p>It had only been about five minutes since Luo Luo Zheng had fought with Fiona.</p>

  <p>How had he changed the time flow rate by ten times within such a short span of time?!</p>

  <p>It was inconceivable.</p>

  <p>The little monster, who was not previously interested in the fight, woke up at this moment. Perhaps the only fight that could pique his interest was the one between the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm. It was quite obvious that the battle between Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors was nothing to him.</p>

  <p>His strange-looking black eyes glittered as he gazed upon the scene before him.</p>

  <p>'Your talent is extraordinary. If I devour you and take your talent, wouldn't I become more powerful?' the little monster thought, sticking out his tongue and licking the tip of his nose.</p>

  <p>The little monster's eyes weren't his only strange features. His tongue was like the tongue of a snake, split open in the middle and incredibly long, reaching his nose when he stuck it out.</p>

  <p>But there was another great secret about this little monster, one that had always been kept highly confidential among the senior leaders of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>This little monster liked to devour human brains and as a consequence, he could take their talent as his own.</p>

  <p>Many powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm knew the little monster's secret very well. The stronger the little monster was, the more he would spread out his talent, which would benefit the warriors who dueled with him. This meant that the warriors who dueled with the little monster would easily enter a state of epiphany and make a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>All these years, the four divine kingdoms had secretly sacrificed many second tier talents. They had offered these talents to this little monster, who would promptly swallow them.</p>

  <p>This would occasionally result in the sudden disappearance of one or two divine-level talents from the martial houses of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>But the Divine Kingdom Continent was so vast that it was difficult for anyone to notice these disappearances. So far, no one had realized this.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly as he looked at Fiona. He then took out his space ring and gently tossed it into the air. The ring flew three feet above Luo Zheng's head and as he spread out his fingers, a wave of power from the Time Law surged out.</p>

  <p>A strange scene played out.</p>

  <p>The ring seemed to fall at such a slow speed that it felt like time had stopped, and it finally landed on his hand.</p>

  <p>"Your talent is amazing!" Fiona exclaimed as she saw this. "You managed to compress time by such a large margin! Ten times! And in such a short time! Back when I was comprehending the Time Law, it took me three years to achieve this!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had experienced baptism by laws and had the highest level of affinity with all laws. So he could comprehend any law in no time. A few months ago, when Luo Luo Zheng had fought Camilla, he had tried to comprehend the Time Law from her. However, the Time Law that Camilla had mastered was too little, causing Luo Luo Zheng to fail in his attempt.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had tried to find out where Camilla had cultivated the Time Law. Later on, he learned that the totem which carried the Time Law was currently placed in the Wind Divine Kingdom and had always been with the royal family, which meant that Luo Luo Zheng had no chance to comprehend the Time Law through the totem.</p>

  <p>So when Luo Luo Zheng saw that Fiona had mastered the complete power of the Time Law, he knew that he couldn't possibly let such a good chance slip by!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and merely asked, "Shall we continue?"</p>

  <p>Fiona's slender eyebrows shot up. But she recovered and said, "Okay.</p>

  <p>But don't get carried away. You have only compressed time by ten times, and I can already compress time by a hundred times. My absolute speed is still ten times faster than yours!"</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, she waved her jade bracelet around lightly, causing the power of the Time Law to spread out once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew the gap in the mastery of Time Law between him and Fiona, but he didn't agree that she was ten times faster than him.</p>

  <p>If both of them didn't use the power of the Time Law, then Luo Luo Zheng could use his full strength to make his forceful energy and life vitality burst out at the same time. And together with the boost from the Cloud-chasing Lion's talent, Luo Luo Zheng would be twice as fast as Fiona.</p>

  <p>Once the difference in the Time Law between them would be offset, Fiona's absolute speed would only be five times faster than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could accept such a difference.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Fiona's expression became more serious by the minute. Although she was an innocent and naive girl, she was way too serious about the cultivation of martial arts - more than anyone else. After all, just relying on one's talent wasn't enough for one to succeed in the pursuit of martial arts. Without strong will, perseverance, passion and seriousness, one wouldn't be able to walk too far on this path.</p>

  <p>Fiona's figure flashed and once again darted behind Luo Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng's speed was still relatively, extremely slow, but it was much faster than before.</p>

  <p>Poof!</p>

  <p>This time, Fiona thumped Luo Luo Zheng heavily on his back. Luo Luo Zheng twisted his body and used his elbow to block Fiona's attack.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound rang out as Luo Luo Zheng felt the breath whoosh out of him. But since he had been prepared in a defensive position, he wasn't injured.</p>

  <p>A crackling tension filled the air, filling the atmosphere within the enchanted barrier with an unparalleled intensity.</p>

  <p>Fiona constantly struck out her palm. It was true that she had a considerable advantage in speed, but Luo Luo Zheng had combat experience that Fiona couldn't compare with. He could always predict what would happen in advance and defend himself against Fiona's attack even before it happened.</p>

  <p>What was more astonishing was that not only was Luo Luo Zheng able to block Fiona's attack, the speed with which he was comprehending the Time Law was also rapidly increasing.</p>

  <p>By the time Luo Luo Zheng had blocked thirteen strikes from Fiona, he had already been able to compress time by about eleven times. And by the time Fiona had struck Luo Luo Zheng twenty times, Luo Luo Zheng had already been able to compress time by about twelve times.</p>

  <p>Everything was difficult at the beginning. As Luo Luo Zheng gained more insights into the first layer of the Time Law, his speed of comprehending the Time Law increased in leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>A powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm figured out what was happening and shook his head. Fiona would be in a pickle, he thought.</p>
