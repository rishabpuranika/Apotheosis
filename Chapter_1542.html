  <p>The blue-robed warrior's jaw dropped in shock at the scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>His right hand made the sign of the cross when he felt the explosive power behind him. Then three swords flew out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>Each sword that flew out was a different color. One was gold, then silver, and lastly, bronze.</p>

  <p>The surfaces of their blades were engraved with beautiful lines, which made their appearances more eye-catching.</p>

  <p>The city lord, who was also the young master of Ji Clan, had given him the black sword, which Luo Luo Zheng had twisted and broken. These three metal-colored swords, on the other hand, were his usual weapons. They had been with him for years and were connected to his soul.</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew sharply as the three swords flew and resonated with each other. Then, their blades began to rotate rapidly.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>As the three swords spun around the blue-robed warrior, they formed a tri-colored tornado.</p>

  <p>"Three-sword Spinning Kill!"</p>

  <p>The tornado sounded like a strong, howling wind. It was like a huge dragon that flew in the air, wanting to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng rushed straight ahead without any hesitation like the sharpest spear.</p>

  <p>Ping! Ping! Ping!</p>

  <p>There were loud, metallic clanging sounds as the three swords hidden within the tornado clashed against his body.</p>

  <p>However scary it might seem, Luo Luo Zheng didn't need protective armor since his physical body was like a first-rank divine weapon. Thus, his body wouldn't be hurt even if the swords were sharp.</p>

  <p>The only thing that bothered him was his own clothes. All the strangling and killing had torn Luo Zheng's cyan cotton clothes into strips and shreds.</p>

  <p>Then again, this wasn't the first time it happened to him. It was why he had to have new sets of clothes from time to time.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng passed through the tri-colored tornado by force and charged straight at the blue-robed warrior, his hands extended out like lightning.</p>

  <p>When the blue-robed warrior saw that he wouldn't be able to escape, he somersaulted like a kite and flicked out a golden ball, which suddenly shattered.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can have my Illusion Points? In your dreams!</p>

  <p>My Illusion Points are all collected for the city lord's sake! Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng was simply confused at his words. He only needed to kill this man and get half of his Illusion Points. Why was he saying things like Luo Luo Zheng couldn't get the Illusion Points?</p>

  <p>His thoughts were disturbed when the golden ball the blue-robed warrior had crushed emitted a violent Mu Ning, which spread out in various directions.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng judged that the situation wasn't right, so he quickly retreated to the back.</p>

  <p>He went back so fast that the distance between him and the blue-robed warrior was now over a hundred feet!</p>

  <p>The golden ball shattered in just three seconds, and then strands of hair-like blood red lightning exploded from within it.</p>

  <p>The strands of lightning were as thin as hair, but they were dense and spread outwards like a cluster of roots. They completely enveloped the blue-robed warrior within a hundred feet radius, which turned him into a giant thunder ball.</p>

  <p>The golden ball was overwhelmingly powerful that Luo Zheng's eyelids twitched wildly when he saw it.</p>

  <p>"This golden ball is too terrifying!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Had Luo Luo Zheng been involved in, the terrifying blood-colored lightning might have torn him to shreds by now.</p>

  <p>While death in the Illusion Battlefield didn't mean he'd actually die in the outside world, he would've lost half of his Illusion Points after his death.</p>

  <p>Now, if this fight had happened outside the Illusion Battlefield, then he would probably be killed for real.</p>

  <p>Aside from the coldness in Luo Zheng's heart, he also thought about what the blue-robed warrior said before he died. "Why can't I get his Illusion Points?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Illusion Battlefield, the blue-robed warrior would still lose half of his Illusion Points even if he killed himself? just like the warriors who had been killed by the Celestial Mice in the wilderness. The Illusion Points would then turn into a yellow light ball, and all Luo Luo Zheng had to do was absorb it.</p>

  <p>After the blue-robed warrior died, a large amount of Illusion Points indeed appeared where he was.</p>

  <p>The densely packed Illusion Points were so many that they were twice the amount Luo Luo Zheng had obtained from when he killed Layne. This meant that there were at least 200, 000 Illusion Points within the blue-robed warrior's body.</p>

  <p>However, something strange happened. After the yellow spots appeared, they didn't enter Luo Zheng's body. It was because he did not kill the blue-robed warrior.</p>

  <p>Not only that, but the Illusion Points flew away and were headed towards the city.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was truly shocked. This wasn't in the rules that he knew.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the city lord could change the rules of the Illusion Battlefield?</p>

  <p>This was impossible!</p>

  <p>In addition, the guards on top of the city walls didn't even move when they saw that the blue-robed warrior was dead.</p>

  <p>It was clear that even the blue-robed warrior was no match for Luo Luo Zheng, so the guards would only be giving Luo Luo Zheng Illusion Points if they rushed out of the city.</p>

  <p>However, there was a mocking smile that hung on each of their faces as they stared at Luo Luo Zheng, as if patronizing his childishness.</p>

  <p>The many warriors at the city's entrance all had different expressions.</p>

  <p>They had surrendered to the city lord and naturally wouldn't tell Luo Luo Zheng the reason.</p>

  <p>Dust fell off Luo Zheng's feet as he floated ten feet above the ground, his face grim as he watched the scene. He felt somewhat helpless when he saw the massive amount of Illusion Points disappear.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed sharply as he flew along the wall.</p>

  <p>The so-called city lord had more than one subordinate. Since the city was too big, the news of him killing the blue-robed warrior might not spread.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng now looked for his next target? the city lord's another subordinate.</p>

  <p>After the heavy cluster of yellow light spots floated away and finally entered the city, they flew into a house in the southwest part of the city.</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the Illusion Battlefield fought with all their might and used every method available for the Illusion Points, whether it was fighting other warriors or killing all kinds of beasts in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>However, this house appeared to be quite peaceful.</p>

  <p>A few snowflakes, like weightless cotton, gently rained down upon it.</p>

  <p>But since it was scorching hot, the snowflakes were naturally man-made.</p>

  <p>There was clearly something up with the place.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng had felt the chill in the air when he was near the house's entrance. Even ordinary warriors knew that it wasn't a good place to stay, so they had all retreated.</p>

  <p>There was a thick layer of snow on the ground within the courtyard of the house. With its serene atmosphere, standing in the middle of it felt like it was in the middle of winter.</p>

  <p>A woman in a long, purple dress was sitting in one corner of the snow-covered courtyard, a silk book in the palm of her hand.</p>

  <p>The silk book did not have any pictures drawn on it. Instead, it was filled with small words. It was actually a novel.</p>

  <p>Warriors were in an absolute ruling position in the one hundred thousand supreme worlds of the entire universe. To put it bluntly, everyone paid great importance to cultivation. They didn't care about literature at all.</p>

  <p>Scholars were in the lower class even among mortals. They were insignificant beings that did not exist in the mainstream culture of any race.</p>

  <p>However, the past few years saw the Upper World bustle with novels.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because the status of the scholars had been elevated. Poems, songs, and the like were not popular among the warriors. However, all kinds of novels were popular.</p>

  <p>The reason behind it was still Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although many warriors were annoyed when he had told stories to the mysterious woman with his Roaring Token, some still listened and became interested.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng still had to cultivate so he had little time to tell stories.</p>

  <p>Besides, he told stories because of the mysterious woman. The other warriors would gather and listen to the stories when the mysterious woman came out of seclusion; but when she hid, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't tell any tales at all.</p>

  <p>There were many warriors in the universe, but even more mortals, who were more culturally inclined than the warriors.</p>

  <p>The warriors soon found that spending a life vitality crystal was enough to buy countless novels. They could even hire hundreds of storytellers to tell stories every day. It had become the most fashionable thing among them in the last few years.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the status of some mortals rose greatly. For example, a storyteller emerged in a small city under the command of a sixth-grade sacred place of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>All the stories he told were written by himself. He was very good at his storytelling, whatever his mood or demeanor was. A warrior in the sacred place admired him, so his status rose bit by bit when he was introduced. It was even said that he caused two sacred places to fight over him.</p>

  <p>Later on, a warrior even gave the storyteller a pill, which gave him an extra few hundred years of lifespan. This was already very shocking among mortals as even some of the small countries' kings would not receive such treatment.</p>

  <p>But all in all, the elevated status of the scholars was all thanks to one person, and that was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that he used the Roaring Token to tell the mysterious woman stories and caught the interest of some warriors, there wouldn't be such a trend.</p>
