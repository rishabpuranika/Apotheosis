<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was very aware that this kind of treatment was special. Unique, in a way. And it was also notably quite rare in the divine land.</p>

  <p>In any case, it was only the Holy Beings' disciples that were actually capable of extracting strength source like this. Holy Beings used this absorbed strength source to build the universes.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, this strength source was more than just precious in the eyes of the Holy Beings. They needed this strength in order to continue building, and taking the decision to have it absorbed was difficult for them due to the constant extraction of their power.</p>

  <p>As for the master of Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, why he was so willing to have all his personal strength source extracted. That was and would remain a mystery. The master shared his strength source with the living creatures around him.</p>

  <p>By the time all the Path Platforms were completed, each of them flashing dazzling ray of light, a solid five minutes had passed. For Luo Luo Zheng though, it was like having traveled entire lifetimes of numerous body refiners. Not only that, but his Path Platforms were the purest ones around and they were already in their most perfect stage - without any cracks or flaws!</p>

  <p>Finally!</p>

  <p>His Eight Path Platforms were completed.</p>

  <p>Slowly, the vortexes that had earlier been created within all parts of Luo Zheng's body began to gradually dissipate into thin air. The absorption of the strength source equally slowed before coming to a complete stop.</p>

  <p>"The Eight Path Platforms have been formed. Now, you can prepare for the Nine Divine Stars!" Making him jump slightly in surprise, the red dragon's voice sounded once again in his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng kept his eyes firmly closed.</p>

  <p>Following the patterns the red dragon had sent him, Luo Luo Zheng continued to absorb the strength source. There wasn't much left, thanks to the vortexes, and now with the red dragon's encouragement, Luo Luo Zheng felt capable of finishing the job.</p>

  <p>Quickly after the strength source was absorbed, it began circulating within Luo Zheng's cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>For a body refiner, having the Nine Divine Stars was a one-way path to perfection. And Luo Luo Zheng, as a body refiner, knew he had to attain this goal more than anything else he had ever achieved in the past.</p>

  <p>Working within his own inner world, he had to build, to create those nine stars of utmost importance and greatness.</p>

  <p>It must be said that a normal warrior would never create stars in their inner world. It was simple: A warrior wasn't a Holy Being. Their inner world was therefore incomplete.</p>

  <p>Body refiners, on the other hand, had nine stars in their cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>With the nine stars forming a circle, their power could and would grow endlessly. The challenge here was building them.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it too early for Luo Luo Zheng to build the Nine Divine Stars?" asked a green-colored Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>Since the ancient times, since the beginning of their history, cultivation had always been a specialty. One could say that such was even favored.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the Lower World, the Upper World, or even the divine land, cultivators who could cultivate both body and life vitality simultaneously were beings of an extreme rarity. And such beings had to be cared for. Members with this level of power had to live in order to achieve greatness.</p>

  <p>These cultivators who could cultivate both body and life vitality at the same time definitely couldn't go further on this path.</p>

  <p>But this limit was only for ordinary warriors!</p>

  <p>In fact, if a True God of the divine land had the desire to pursue the path of Holy Being, they wouldn't just cultivate these two, but cultivate three.</p>

  <p>They were soul, life vitality and body.</p>

  <p>And it was only when one reached the genuine pinnacle of soul cultivation, life vitality cultivation and body refining, would they have the qualifications to build a true inner world. Only then would they have the qualifications to construct such a universe, a world of its own, placed at the edge of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng was only a warrior of the Spirit Supreme Realm. It was a known fact that the inner world of a warrior of the Spirit Supreme Realm was incapable of holding nine stars!</p>

  <p>The green Genuine Dragon was right. It was too early for Luo Luo Zheng. The moment the strength source would enter his inner world, it would explode Luo Zheng's weak inner world. Needless to say, such a result would be extremely tragic.</p>

  <p>The green dragon continued mulling over his thoughts. Of course, his greatest worry right now was that Luo Zheng's current inner world would explode, especially in its actual state.</p>

  <p>"No? Luo Zheng's inner world is indeed weak, but it's no longer an ordinary inner world. He now has a real inner world!" The Five-clawed Golden Dragon opened his mouth to speak.</p>

  <p>They could see Luo Zheng's every move and they all had been watching him with intent and interest. All the dragons had kept their eyes on him, never daring to look away, not even for a second, not even to blink. They had watched him remove a small but lively fish from his own inner world.</p>

  <p>Facial expressions began to change while they watched this scene, going from outright astonished to overwhelmed with emotion. What the Genuine Dragons had been observing all along was becoming clear to them all.</p>

  <p>The images playing before their eyes allowed them to finally understand what they were dealing with. Luo Zheng's inner world did have the same characteristics as that of a Holy Being. His inner world was constructed from chaotic energy, which was beyond the comprehension of the Genuine Dragons.</p>

  <p>In a way, Luo Luo Zheng was a small "Holy Being". In fact, he could even be stronger than one.</p>

  <p>The inner world created by the Holy Being was formed from life vitality, and was limited by the heavens. If any living creature within it wanted to transcend this boundary, they would have to comprehend the Divine Dao in order to obtain the qualifications for crossing the heavens and entering the divine land.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng's inner world, it was on a whole new level. It was instead formed from chaotic energy and without restriction from the heavens, all living creatures could leave his inner world directly!</p>

  <p>Looking at it from this angle, Luo Zheng's inner world was most definitely not just any ordinary world. It was far from an ordinary universe, even. This was a divine land... A miniature divine land!</p>

  <p>Yes, the nine Genuine Dragons had chosen Luo Luo Zheng for their own purpose.</p>

  <p>They wished to return to their own land, to guide Luo Luo Zheng in his search for the truth, and they wished that he would ultimately help them seek revenge.</p>

  <p>Which gave reason as to why the Grand Weapon Refining Method had been used on Luo Luo Zheng, resulting in his unique body and capacity.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng entered the Immortal Mansion and started practicing the Primal Chaos Technique, the situation had already begun to take a turn for the better. Luo Zheng's cultivation had begun progressing beyond any dragon's wildest expectations.</p>
