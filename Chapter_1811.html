  <p>
</p>

  <p>This bolt of lightning was strange. It did not connect with the vitality between heaven and earth, nor did it use life vitality.</p>

  <p>It looked like it was being transferred from Maha's mind. The shape of the lightning was quite different from the ones in the universe.</p>

  <p>Maha had said he would teach Lawson a lesson, but the power of this bolt of lightning was beyond just that. It was extraordinary!</p>

  <p>All the Supreme Lords in the universe restrained themselves this time.</p>

  <p>Maha belonged to the Sacred race. His status was such that even a Supreme Lord in his race might just listen to his commands.</p>

  <p>But Maha had gone too far with his actions against a Godly Geniuse.</p>

  <p>"You're courting death! How dare you!"</p>

  <p>The patriarch of the Lie Clan was the first to step out. A vigorous Mu Ning shot into the sky as the atmosphere of the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place surged.</p>

  <p>But Maha's lightning arc had already struck. It was too late to stop it.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The arcing bolt of lightning pierced Lawson's body with a keening sounding, not unlike a pig being butchered.</p>

  <p>The lightning bolt didn't look overly powerful and seemed to be one that was meant to merely teach a lesson. But Lawson frantically rolled around on the ground like a twisting water snake.</p>

  <p>It was rare to see Lawson in such pain, which could only mean that the bolt of lightning was extremely torturous.</p>

  <p>The patriarch of the Lie Clan was torn between attending to Lawson's injuries and attacking Maha.</p>

  <p>A cold light flashed in the patriarch's hand, indicating the appearance of a dragon-headed saber. He raised the saber and brought it slashing down without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>The nine Supreme Lords beside Maha moved into different positions.</p>

  <p>Each of them flashed a pale green ring, the lights of which quickly connected to each other.</p>

  <p>They had set up an array formation!</p>

  <p>Since Supreme Lords had different types of Heavenly Destinies, it was very rare for them to cultivate an array together.</p>

  <p>This was happening only in the universe where Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>In the universe where the Sacred race came from, almost every supreme world was occupied by the Sacred race. Small races like the humans, the Demon Night, and the ogres were all concentrated in two or three supreme worlds, like pets of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>This made the Sacred Race a highly unified one.</p>

  <p>In this universe, however, many Supreme Lords couldn't choose which Crown of Destiny to bear.</p>

  <p>Since the Crown of Destiny usually appeared randomly after the fall of a Supreme Lord, whoever seized it would bear it. It didn't matter which rank the Heavenly Destiny was at. No one had a choice. As long as one could have the Heavenly Destiny, one became a Supreme Lord. There was no need for them to care too much about what kind of Heavenly Destiny they got.</p>

  <p>A top-rank Heavenly Destiny had only been selected once when the Celestial Position relied on Lester's Heavenly Destiny of Revival to continuously kill and revive a Supreme Lord, and other races had agreed not to fight over it.</p>

  <p>But once a Supreme Lord of the Sacred race perished, the entire race would have to wait for the next Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Once the Crown of Destiny appeared in the universe, every race would rush to take it over.</p>

  <p>But the Sacred race would analyze the Crown of Destiny and find out what Heavenly Destiny it contained before they took it. If this Heavenly Destiny was not good, they would just wait quietly and let it disappear.</p>

  <p>Before long, this Crown of Destiny would once again appear in another location, the Heavenly Destiny within this Crown of Destiny having undergone a new change.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race used this method to replace Heavenly Destiny that wasn't very useful or powerful enough. Only after they managed to sift through a strong Heavenly Destiny would they appoint a world lord of the Sacred race to receive it.</p>

  <p>This meant that the advantage of the Sacred race didn't just lie in their True Gods. Even a Supreme Lord of this race was much more qualified than a Supreme Lord in the universe.</p>

  <p>Because these Supreme Lords were familiar with each other, they were able to use their abilities to lay down a powerful array.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords wouldn't watch on as the patriarch of Lie Clan got to work.</p>

  <p>The auras of the dozens of Supreme Lords looked like they had solidified. Even the air seemed to have frozen.</p>

  <p>Maha let a thin smile snake across his face. He wasn't panicking even though he was facing the earth-shattering blade attack of the Lie Clan patriarch.</p>

  <p>But at the center of the formation that the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race had formed, space began to fluctuate with extreme intensity. As the saber came cutting down, a large hand suddenly appeared in the fluctuating space.</p>

  <p>It reached out and flailed for a hot minute before grabbing, shattering the Lie Clan patriarch's saber light.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>It was not only the saber light that had broken.</p>

  <p>Countless cracks began to appear on the blade in the patriarch's hand.</p>

  <p>The blade continued to twist, and eventually turned into an iron rod.</p>

  <p>This hand clearly hadn't come into contact with the dragon-headed saber, but had produced a strange effect. What level of power that hand must have!</p>

  <p>The patriarch of Lie Clan threw Maha an ugly look. The Supreme Lord of Original Sin and Supreme Lord of Oracle looked gloomy.</p>

  <p>This dragon-headed saber was called the 'Buried Sea'. It ranked twelfth on the Universe Spirit Tablet, and was made of material from the Dark Star itself. It was also not something that an ordinary Supreme Lord could use. Only the patriarch of the Lie Clan could.</p>

  <p>Such a blade had been crushed into a steel rod and turned into a piece of scrap metal without even making contact with the huge hand!</p>

  <p>How strong must the hand be!</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Once the hand withdrew, an evil snort sounded off it.</p>

  <p>It spread out, causing the hearts of the Supreme Lords to tremble. The Godly Geniuses were pale as paper as they subconsciously retreated.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Zheng stood there, motionless.</p>

  <p>The True God hadn't come, but this race had managed to pressurize so many Supreme Lords with just a single hand!</p>

  <p>True Gods were also divided into different grades.</p>

  <p>Top-rank Supreme Lords like Supreme Lord of Original Sin and Master Feng, had the ability to fight True Gods of the lowest level. After all, they were only a half-step away from being a True God.</p>

  <p>But the owner of this hand seemed to be far more than just an ordinary True God.</p>

  <p>Master Feng and the others were still holding back. The truth was, if several Supreme Lords joined hands, they didn't need to be afraid of this giant hand. But it wasn't time for them to fight. Instead, they had to put up with them.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Lawson had already pulled himself off the ground. His screams had been fierce, but he hadn't suffered any serious injuries.</p>

  <p>"So this is a True God!" Luo Zheng stared at the huge hand, his eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>As he was sizing the hand up, Luo Zheng felt an unfriendly gaze lock onto him.</p>

  <p>It was from Maha.</p>

  <p>Their gazes met and their hearts skipped a collective beat.</p>

  <p>Maha usually looked down on these Godly Geniuses. But the moment he had looked at Luo Zheng, he had understood almost instantly that this was the boy that had won the Illusion Battlefield. Although Zheng's cultivation was only at the Spirit Supreme Realm, his potential was surprisingly strong.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were calm. As he looked at Maha, there wasn't a trace of anger in them. It was as if this was a matter of course.</p>

  <p>The two of them looked at each other for less than three seconds. But Zheng's face contorted into a contemptuous smile.</p>

  <p>"What are you laughing at?" Maha was annoyed at this show of contempt. In any case, he had already broken off all decorum. Maha predicted that these Supreme Lords didn't dare fight here. So he addressed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This Maha had come prepared today. Even if they couldn't negotiate, they would still rely on the deterrence of a True God to display their might.</p>

  <p>"I'm laughing at you, a mere world lord. You can't wait to use the power of the True God behind you, and yet you feel proud of yourself?" Luo Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Maha's face fell. He had long since had the opportunity to bear the Heavenly Destiny. At the time, there had even been a supreme Heavenly Destiny that would help him become a top-rank Supreme Lord. But he had chosen to give it up. He would become bound by the heavens after bearing the Heavenly Destiny, unable to cross the heavens to become a True God.</p>

  <p>To him, the sacrifice was too great. He had the ambition to become a True God, and this ambition was now not too far away from him.</p>
