<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1892 Luo Zheng's Reflection </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No other names that Han Liusu said would have shocked Luo Luo Zheng more.</p>

  <p>The master of Evolutionary Universe where Luo Luo Zheng lived was called Mike Luo who was also a Holy Being living in the divine land.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Zheng's mind went blank. He just could not think.</p>

  <p>'Maybe it is just a coincidence, ' he mused. Although the name Mike Luo was not common, it wasn't a rare name either.</p>

  <p>However it was not very rational to see it as a coincidence.</p>

  <p>Earlier also Tianming and the others had kept many information from him.</p>

  <p>Did they also conceal these secrets from him too?</p>

  <p>There was also the issue of his own fate. At that time, Luo Luo Zheng displayed great talent, compared with the warriors in great world. But if one were to look at the entire universe, then Luo Luo Zheng, with his low cultivation level at that time, was nothing compared to the warriors of the universe.</p>

  <p>So, why did that young man appear abruptly and abduct Yan? Was it because she was his the fate pointer?</p>

  <p>All these thoughts were running across Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Maybe all this was just a fabricated excuse.</p>

  <p>To be more specific, his fate was to make him advance towards the divine land.</p>

  <p>As he went through all these thoughts, Luo Luo Zheng could understand the situation more clearly.</p>

  <p>If one were to assume that the young man was a True God who could descend upon the universe at his will, then he had to be a disciple of the Holy Being.</p>

  <p>But no ordinary True God could return to the universe. In Luo Zheng's eye, the only True God was Wynn of Celestial Position, one of the Holy Being's disciples.</p>

  <p>When his own strength was merely in the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he was under the care of this disciple whose strength was equal to a True God's.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, his father who died was called Mike Luo and the name of the Holy Being also was Mike Luo.</p>

  <p>With this deduction, nothing that happened so far was a coincidence after all!</p>

  <p>If his father really was the creator of the universe, then Mike would be an omnipotent existence in the inner world. He turned into a nature creature and gave birth to a Luo Clan in a certain corner of the universe.</p>

  <p>Then Mike had cultivated Luo Luo Zheng until he grew up. In the end, Mike promptly arranged for some tragedy to ensure his death.</p>

  <p>His hatred would be a motivation for Luo Luo Zheng to grow up faster With these never ending thoughts, Luo Zheng's breath became heavier.</p>

  <p>There were also other evidences supporting these facts that Luo Luo Zheng knew about. After Luo Luo Zheng had used his soul to attack the 'little monster' of the York Divine Kingdom, he had directly taken over the will of the great world by devouring his soul!</p>

  <p>The outcome came so naturally, as if the will of this great world had always belonged to him.</p>

  <p>There were only few people who studied the will of the world, so Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find any reference. That was why he didn't consider it to be weird. On the contrary, he had thought that it made sense. Now after careful deliberation, he realized that perhaps his ability to inherit the will of the great world was related to Mike.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought about his encounter with Luck-devouring Snakes when he was going through 'Passing the Torch'. An enormous figure had suddenly appeared, ripping the Luck-devouring Snakes into shreds and devouring them.</p>

  <p>These things could not be mere coincidences. The appearance of the enormous figure was quite baffling. Back then Luo Luo Zheng didn't even have the ability to fight the snakes.</p>

  <p>It was as if there was an invisible guardian god behind him that appeared during crucial moments, protecting and allowing him to successfully pass through.</p>

  <p>However, he was not protected all the time. At least, it did not happen when Luo Luo Zheng had been through several life and death situations. Perhaps the formless guardian god wanted to strengthen his will that time.</p>

  <p>Of course, all these thoughts were just Luo Zheng's assumptions!</p>

  <p>However, the possibility of these hypotheses being true was quite high.</p>

  <p>All that was remaining for Luo Luo Zheng to do was to personally confirm it.</p>

  <p>When he realized that his father did not die after all, Luo Luo Zheng was going through a mix of emotions. After all, according to both Tianming and Han Liusu, the creator of Evolutionary Universe was on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>Even if it was proved that the Holy Being was the same person as Luo Zheng's father, he would have to shoulder the heavy burden.</p>

  <p>In all probability, this heavy burden would have fallen on Luo Zheng's shoulder from the moment he was born. Something that Mike was likely to arrange.</p>

  <p>Under the turmoil of various thoughts in his mind, he collapsed into silence for a long time.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Luo Zheng." Han Liusu called out a few times, but Luo Luo Zheng remained silent. He just stared into the distance.</p>

  <p>Aleyna stretched out and waved her hand in front of Luo Luo Zheng a few times.</p>

  <p>Seeing no reaction she asked, "Sister, has he lost his mind?"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu shook her head. In her eyes, Luo Zheng's state of mind was extremely strong, and he didn't show panic even in life and death situations. The problem must be the name of the master of Evolutionary Universe. Since the two of them had the same surname and Luo Zheng's talent was so remarkable, could it be that they were father and son?</p>

  <p>This idea did not seem reasonable though.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was really the son of a Holy Being, how could he be just a secondary creature?</p>

  <p>Which Holy Emperor would place their children in the universe to cultivate? The secondary creature had lots of inbred defects. The laws they comprehended were only of the Holy Being. The world they came into contact with was only a world created out of life vitality. They first had to comprehend the Divine Dao and become a True God before gaining the qualifications to walk in the divine land.</p>

  <p>These gaps were difficult to bridge after one was born and had lived for a long time.</p>

  <p>From a different perspective, any creature in the inner world of any warrior could be considered as child of this warrior.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly brushed Aleyna's hand aside. He then flew and landed on a tall tower in the distance.</p>

  <p>Aleyna was hurt by Luo Zheng's gesture and sulking. She looked at her sister.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu did not feel bad for Aleyna. Her younger sister possessed a sensitive personality. She was still trying to understand the ways of the world.</p>

  <p>"Humph, even if Mike is his father, what is the need to be so agitated?"</p>

  <p>Aleyna said unhappily.</p>

  <p>"In the end, you are not him. And that is what matters. If our father was killed by the people from the Hall of Holy Beings, and all the disciples of our Han Clan were to be hunted down, how would you feel?"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu asked.</p>

  <p>Aleyna merely shrugged her shoulders, not knowing what to say.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings was an efficient organization. Each Holy Being had their own rights. Under normal circumstances, it was unlikely for Holy Beings to attack each other. Back then, they had secretly joined hands to kill Mike, the Holy Being of Evolutionary Universe. For a moment, everyone had their own opinions and reasons to kill Mike.</p>

  <p>However, the real reason had never surfaced.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the father of the two sisters knew about this, but it was impossible to discuss such a grave matter with the two little girls in Han Clan who were yet to become True Gods.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was extremely large. Even though one could see the ceiling of the cave from here, this cave was still as wide as several supreme worlds combined.</p>

  <p>Gazing into the distance, Luo Luo Zheng was struggling to remain calm. With this emotional turmoil going on, it seemed like a difficult task to accomplish.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had come across many mysteries, but the recent information was like a sharp knife, cutting through all the doubts in his heart!</p>

  <p>He might be after all a creature that had been deliberately created!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still remembered his father's words. That Mike might be the real Mike's incarnation, but it couldn't be counted as his father in the strict sense.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also had an incarnation when he stepped into his inner world. That was not his original body, but it still executed at his will. He had poured all of his feelings into the body.</p>

  <p>He was still his father!</p>

  <p>Even if he was created deliberately, he would have to repay this debt of gratitude.</p>

  <p>If he had to save Mike, would he also have to face the vast power of the Hall of Holy Beings?</p>

  <p>Compared to a Holy Being, he looked so insignificant, that he could be easily ignored.</p>

  <p>Evolutionary Universe was about to be wiped out by Sacred race. Since Mike had already sent him to this stage, Luo Luo Zheng had to continue with the rest of the journey and accomplish the task at hand. This road was destined to be arduous, but Luo Luo Zheng was not afraid. His eyes shone with excitement.</p>

  <p>He stayed in the Skyland race for two more days, then proceeded ahead.</p>

  <p>Along the way, he visited the Tidal Surge for a while and met Xenia and Karl.</p>

  <p>Out of the ten Godly Geniuses, Luo Luo Zheng knew that six of them had appeared within the Skyland race. He didn't know which cultivation sacred place the remaining four were currently in, especially Mu Ning. Luo Luo Zheng was still a bit concerned. This woman was impulsive and willful, and he hoped she would complete the training in Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Two days later, the Harmony race, the one who controlled the Mind Refining Tower, finally arrived at Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Skyland race, this Harmony race had a very ugly appearance. Their bodies were covered with snake-like scales, and their nose bridge was abnormally high. Their eyes were shaped like triangles, hanging upside down on their faces. If their behavior had not been exceptionally good, Luo Luo Zheng would have treated them like beasts.</p>

  <p>Although this race had a very ugly appearance, Luo Luo Zheng realized that they were a kind and optimistic race, who were much easier to deal with than the Skyland race.</p>
