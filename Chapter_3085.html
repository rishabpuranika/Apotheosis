<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3085 Anger </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's words stunned everyone in the audience.</p>

  <p>When they heard Fergus ask Zheng where he had gotten the Sword-reading Liquid, they thought that Fergus might let Zheng go after knowing the answer.</p>

  <p>After all, it was not easy to get the Sword-reading Liquid. They guessed that maybe Zheng was selling the Sword-reading Liquid for some big shot who had the perfect compatibility degree.</p>

  <p>If Fergus didn't want to offend the big shot behind Zheng, he might not do anything to him and might even spare his life. That way, Zheng would be truly lucky!</p>

  <p>But in reality, Zheng was so bloody arrogant to the extent that he even tried to provoke Fergus.</p>

  <p>'Zheng is digging his grave.'</p>

  <p>'There's no way Fergus would let him go.'</p>

  <p>'There would have been a small chance Fergus would have let him live, had he knelt down and begged for mercy at the beginning. But now there is no hope at all. What could we say! Zheng's arrogance will lead to his death.'</p>

  <p>These were some of the thoughts of the people there, but they could never say them out loud given that there was a group of Alliance Chiefs floating in the air above them.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a gust of chilling air spread out slowly.</p>

  <p>Fergus' slightly obese face turned as pale as a ghost. He used to be a short-tempered man, but the years he spent in the Dragon City had changed him a lot. He was so changed that he thought he was now an even-tempered man.</p>

  <p>However, he just realized that he was even-tempered because no one dared to anger him.</p>

  <p>A cold aura spread out, and even the several Alliance Chiefs retreated. They knew that Fergus was already furious, and they didn't want any part in this.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" Fergus asked and suppressed the anger in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Are you deaf or what? Anyways, I repeat. If you roll along the ground and make it to the entrance of the Dragon City, I'll tell you. If you refuse, I will take that as a sign of not being sincere enough, so I'm not going to tell you,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." Fergus broke out into an angry laugh. "There are many ways to seek death, but I've never met someone seeking death like you are doing!"</p>

  <p>"My pleasure. And I've never met a guy as arrogant as you," Zheng said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Galen approached Fergus and said, "Alliance Chief Fergus, I know this guy has a bitter tongue. Don't bother yourself talking to him anymore, and let me handle him."</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>With a loud smack, Fergus sent Galen flying backwards. Galen dropped to the ground heavily and landed into a Flag Master's territory.</p>

  <p>After sending Galen away, Fergus couldn't compose his anger any longer.</p>

  <p>He moved towards Zheng like a lion heading to its prey.</p>

  <p>'So he is using the Might Godly Way, ' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed when he saw Galen rushing down towards him.</p>

  <p>He also could not help but notice Fergus' astonishing strength. He assumed that he mainly cultivated the Might Godly Way, and also used the force of his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>When Fergus dived down, the pressure he released on Zheng was surprisingly huge.</p>

  <p>After feeling that force, Zheng's followers spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>However, they still found it difficult to stabilize their bodies. Someone actually slumped onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The other Flag Masters even removed the flagpoles they had inserted in the ground and moved to other places to insert their flagpoles again.</p>

  <p>But Zheng still stood there, unmoved, like a statue declaring its territory.</p>

  <p>"Is that guy so scared that he is petrified?"</p>

  <p>"A casual blow from Fergus will at least have the force of ten divine megatons. I'm afraid he'll smash Zheng to pieces!"</p>

  <p>"Let's disband in all directions..."</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was wondering why Zheng didn't move, Zheng's and Fergus' bodies smashed with each other.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, the Oneness Sky Palace disciples had been practicing swordsmanship only. Warriors like Zheng and Fergus who used their brute force to fight were extremely rare. Of course, in the eyes of most people, this was not a battle. They only thought that it was Fergus' way of brutally killing Zheng.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>They heard a muffled sound.</p>

  <p>A huge crater appeared, and in its center, the ground sunk more than a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>No one could clearly see because of the clouds that the dust formed.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was trying to explore it with their spiritual sense, a figure was thrown out of the dust and rolled about seven or eight times before stopping.</p>

  <p>The figure that came out of the crater shocked every single one.</p>

  <p>The expressions of the Alliance Chiefs floating in the sky also changed drastically.</p>

  <p>Why? Because it was no one but Fergus! Not Zheng, as they had all expected.</p>

  <p>This was a result that they could not imagine, even in their wildest dreams!</p>

  <p>"Wow! Our Flag Master is so powerful! He is actually able to fight against an Alliance Chief. I'm so proud!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng has never let us down before."</p>

  <p>Those disciples of the Sword Light Palace were thrilled, and even Beldene, who was supported by the other disciples, had a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I was wrong. Our Flag Master didn't act impulsively. It's just that the speed by which he is improving is far beyond our imagination."</p>

  <p>Just one year ago, Zheng was at the same cultivation level as them. At that time, he had no power to fight against a warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>But now, there was a huge gap between Zheng and them.</p>

  <p>As for the other warriors, when they heard the words of the disciples from the Sword Light Palace, they just couldn't believe their ears. They didn't understand why these disciples were so confident in Zheng. Normally, no Flag Master had the ability to fight against an Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>Zheng's slightly skinny figure slowly and arrogantly floated up from the dust.</p>

  <p>He strolled in the air as he indifferently looked at Fergus on the ground. "If you don't take your opponent seriously, you will often end up like this.</p>

  <p>You're asking for more than you can chew, buddy."</p>

  <p>Fergus was very powerful, but he did not regard Zheng as an opponent, so he did not even use any weapon. He only wanted to tear Zheng with his sheer strength.</p>

  <p>To be fair, seeing that Fergus didn't use any weapon, Zheng didn't use a weapon either.</p>

  <p>Since the Might Godly Way was able to blend with the force of the Other Shore Token, the moment Fergus rushed towards Zheng, Zheng had also gathered his strength source and the force of his Other Shore Token to fight back.</p>

  <p>Actually, Fergus had a tough body that wasn't injured when he was thrown away by Zheng. However, his fists trembled like never before and he was drowned in an unprecedented violent wave of depression.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Zheng was just nothing more than a fly that he could easily kill.</p>

  <p>Maybe even with a single punch!</p>

  <p>However, the power that Zheng had displayed was completely beyond Fergus' expectations.</p>

  <p>Zheng's force might have reached twenty divine megatons. How was this possible? It was utterly unreasonable!</p>

  <p>"Your power... How did you make it?" Fergus asked in a hesitant voice.</p>

  <p>"There are some secrets that can only be told to the dead. Are you sure you still want to know?" Zheng calmly asked.</p>

  <p>Just like that, in about 30 seconds, the two of them seemed to have completely changed their status.</p>

  <p>Even the Alliance Chiefs looked solemnly at Zheng. When they saw his indifferent expression, their hearts skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>The whole thing was awkwardly weird.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just reached the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, and yet he had the force of twenty divine megatons. He had infinite potential.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Dragon City, he should have been sent to the Oneness Sky Palace already.</p>

  <p>In retrospect, it became obvious that Zheng was sure to win against Fergus, or else he wouldn't have acted so calm all this time.</p>

  <p>Walter and the other Alliance Chiefs exchanged looks and wanted to give Fergus a heads-up.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, Zheng had obviously provoked Fergus on purpose just now, which meant that he probably had some other purpose. But Fergus was so angry at this moment that he wouldn't have listened to them.</p>

  <p>"How arrogant you are! I just underestimated you,"</p>

  <p>Fergus said. He was a proud man who had just been beaten by a mere Flag Master. This was sheer humiliation that he had to make up for.</p>

  <p>As he shouted, he stood up from the ground and stretched out his hands; a large white sword with broad blade appeared in front of him, out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"Wild Snow Sword!"</p>

  <p>As Gant saw the sword, his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>This sword was also a premium Profound Blood Treasure. This sword and the Snow Sword that Zheng had bought were forged by the person Gant knew.</p>

  <p>He had no idea that the sword was bought by Fergus.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, he found that it made sense. The sword price was about nine million divine crystals. Not every Alliance Chief could afford to buy such an expensive sword, and since Fergus was probably one of the richest Alliance Chiefs, this was a no-brainer.</p>

  <p>"So you are finally going to take this fight seriously, huh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng taunted. When he sensed the constantly increasing aura from Fergus, his face revealed a trace of satisfaction.</p>
