<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1364 Supreme Lord Sword's Legend </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at Layla's words. "No flaws?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had comprehended the consummate sword intent and even created the No Move, he did not dare guarantee that his sword intent would have no flaws whatsoever.</p>

  <p>However, the No Move did not have a fixed style. If one wanted to break it, one would have to move heaven and earth to do so.</p>

  <p>That did not mean that no one could break it, but so far, Luo Luo Zheng had not encountered anyone who could.</p>

  <p>"Of course. How could the sword intent of the master of Killing Sword Mountain have any flaws?" Layla asked with pride.</p>

  <p>"The master of Killing Sword Mountain?" A curious light gleamed in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Layla pursed her lips. 'Luo Luo Zheng really has come from the Lower World, hasn't he? He doesn't seem to know anything at all, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a cold voice resounded in Luo Zheng's mind. It was Xun. "She was referring to Supreme Lord Sword. Among so many Supreme Lords in the universe, he is an extremely powerful one. His sword is lodged at the top of the Killing Sword Mountain, which is the highest position. If you have any questions, ask me. Don't ask this woman again!"</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Xun found Layla intolerable.</p>

  <p>However, Xun did not know much about the affairs of the human race, such as the broken Orange Sea World. Neither did she know enough about Passing the Torch. After all, these were internal matters of the alliance.</p>

  <p>But how could she not know about Supreme Lord Sword and the Killing Sword Mountain?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in understanding, but his eyes were still fixed on the poem on the huge rock.</p>

  <p>Each word of the poem was about several hundred feet in height and width. As he got closer to the words, he could feel the sharp sword intent radiating from them.</p>

  <p>The warriors at the front had already turned their heads away, unwilling to look at the giant words.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's gaze grew more and more intentional.</p>

  <p>Under such an intense gaze, the large characters seemed to move.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a sword intent shot straight at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The shadow of the sword intent was very faint. Luo Luo Zheng stared at it for a long time but could only see vague outlines.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not fight back. He let the sword intent come at him. The moment the sword intent pierced into his body, an uncomfortable feeling arose in him, as if somebody had truly stabbed him with a sword.</p>

  <p>So the reason why everybody felt uncomfortable when they saw these words was because of the invisible sword intent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at the thought.</p>

  <p>Could this invisible sword intent temper his own sword intent?</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng assumed it might be the case, he was still a bit uncertain.</p>

  <p>Even if he was not sure, he would still give it a try.</p>

  <p>Yolande, who was in front of them, led them around the giant rock. At the same time, she turned around, speaking to everyone. "Our destination is behind the giant rock." As she finished speaking, she saw Luo Luo Zheng halt in his steps.</p>

  <p>She looked at Luo Luo Zheng curiously. "Hey, what are you doing? Do you get scared stiff so easily?"</p>

  <p>Yolande also flew over. Although she had no reason to intervene in Luo Zheng's business, Passing the Torch was very important and she had to know what Luo Luo Zheng was up to.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Luo Luo Zheng?" Yolande followed his gaze. "Is there a problem with the words?"</p>

  <p>"I want to give it a try," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Try what?" Yolande asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Layla's gaze gleamed with curiosity as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already taken the Thunder Wind Divine Sword out of his space ring by now. He pointed at the words and said, "I can see a faint sword intent. I want to try and see if I can temper my sword intent with it."</p>

  <p>When they heard this, both Yolande and Layla stared at him, their eyes wide as saucers.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! You think the legend is true?" Layla cried out.</p>

  <p>Yolande stared at Luo Luo Zheng, seemingly lost in thought. Back when she had brought Luo Luo Zheng to Mist Palace, she had told herself that anything was possible with him. However, she did not think that he would perform so many miracles in such a short amount of time after coming here.</p>

  <p>Noting their exaggerated reactions, Luo Luo Zheng looked at them strangely. Due to his lack of concentration, the faint shadow of the sword intent had long disappeared. It was as if he had to be extremely alert and focused to be able to see the sword intent.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Yolande did not answer his question but asked, "Can you really see the sword intent? What does it look like?"</p>

  <p>Layla also stared fixedly at Luo Luo Zheng, but did not say anything. Yolande had already asked him the question on her mind.</p>

  <p>"It's just a pale white sword," Luo Luo Zheng explained. "It's about two feet long; rather short."</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword in Luo Zheng's hand was five feet long, almost twice the length of the white sword he had seen.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded and sighed. "Then it is indeed Supreme Lord Sword's sword. His sword is two and a half feet long, white in color. It is said that Supreme Lord Sword can battle against a True God."</p>

  <p>Layla pouted. In fact, she believed Luo Luo Zheng more than Yolande herself did.</p>

  <p>Yolande asked Luo Luo Zheng the question because she was suspicious, but Layla had already known that Luo Luo Zheng knew nothing of the Orange Sea World or Supreme Lord Sword, which was why it was even more impossible for him to know about this legend.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he could not make up a story to fool them. As such, what he said was correct.</p>

  <p>Seeing Yolande's shocked expression, Luo Luo Zheng asked, "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"It happened inside the human race, but the legend is very famous,"</p>

  <p>Xun told Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword earned his title because it was said that he could compete with a True God with his swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>However, he did not have a successor. His swordsmanship had disappeared along with him.</p>

  <p>According to the legends, he had carved his swordsmanship into a poem, evidently the one that was inscribed on the massive rock before them.</p>

  <p>It was said that if one could see his sword intent in the poem, he would be able to comprehend his swordsmanship and be considered his successor.</p>

  <p>This legend had once been popular among the warriors.</p>

  <p>It was the reason why many swordsmen spent their savings and became destitute. They wished to read the poem and comprehend the swordsmanship. They wanted to learn the ultimate skill of Supreme Lord Sword? a swordsmanship that could fight a True God.</p>

  <p>All swordsmen yearned for such power.</p>

  <p>After Xun narrated the first half of the story to Luo Luo Zheng mentally, Yolande told him the remaining part. She pointed to the small island below.</p>

  <p>"Look at the densely packed pits in the ground below," Yolande said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked in the direction indicated by Yolande. Numerous small pits were present in the ground. It could make one's hair stand on end, for there were probably millions of them.</p>

  <p>"What are these?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The pits were created by swordsmen who sat quietly in front of the rock, in order to meditate."</p>

  <p>There were warriors who had great perseverance. In order to comprehend Supreme Lord Sword's sword intent, they had been willing to spend all their lives here, no matter how arduous it was.</p>

  <p>Some Life and Death Realm warriors almost threw away their entire life's worth of time before this giant rock. Just like that, they sat and meditated, visualizing and comprehending, hoping that one day they would be able to see through the mystery of the poem.</p>

  <p>If one sat here for tens of thousands of years, it would cause the ground to cave in and a pit to appear.</p>

  <p>As he heard this, Luo Luo Zheng sucked in a sharp breath of cold air before asking in concern, "Did anyone succeed?"</p>

  <p>Yolande had a small smile on her face as she shook her head. "No, not a single one of them."</p>

  <p>"What? They spent their entire lives here, yet they failed. It must have been such a loss to them." Luo Luo Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>"They were like gamblers. The more they lost, the more stubborn they became. In the end, they were no longer able to leave and spent their entire lives on the gambling table. They thought that if they won, they would learn the outstanding swordsmanship. But they lost, so they could only accept the bitter outcome," Yolande said.</p>

  <p>"Truly admirable," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>However, Layla frowned. "It's not like everyone just accepted the outcome so easily. There were still some who could not do it. A lot of people accused Supreme Lord Sword right after going through the Five Aging Processes. It is said that they too carved their words here, but I don't know exactly where."</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head and pointed in a direction. "They are over there."</p>
