<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3986 Giant Hawk </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Bone-coagulating Powder and the Solid Lightning Powder were similar in appearance, but their properties were vastly different.</p>

  <p>After the palm formed by the Bone-coagulating Powder spread out, it exploded out into the air with a terrific roar.</p>

  <p>Normally, a small quantity of Bone-coagulating Powder could freeze the space channel and cause it to collapse, but a large amount of Bone-coagulating Powder could even affect ordinary space.</p>

  <p>The space around the group of daredevils suddenly became viscous. These daredevils now looked as if they were moving through heavy oil, and their movements slowed and became somewhat comical.</p>

  <p>At least, this was how it appeared to those who saw them, but to the daredevils trapped in the space, it didn't feel funny at all.</p>

  <p>They felt that their surroundings had changed, and all their hopes were shattered…</p>

  <p>'It's all over. This is the end...'</p>

  <p>'We are doomed!'</p>

  <p>'Self-sacrifice for our race!'</p>

  <p>Every race had different values their members lived by, but each member had their own thoughts.</p>

  <p>However, this "viscous" feeling lasted for only six seconds and then it vanished.</p>

  <p>Everything returned to normal...</p>

  <p>They looked down at their bodies and hands, and there was an undisguised relief on their confused faces.</p>

  <p>"It's fake!"</p>

  <p>"That's the Bone-coagulating Powder! It's known for destroying space!"</p>

  <p>"They don't have any more of that powder which they used before!"</p>

  <p>The daredevils immediately reacted, and the eyes of the non-human creatures in the distance blazed with fury.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak...</p>

  <p>The Terror Mice let out terrifing squeaks. While they had been standing randomly, they now suddenly lined up orderly. They piled together according to some unspoken rule, three to a group, or five, or seven, and then they charged forward…</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump...</p>

  <p>The giants also barged ahead.</p>

  <p>Although their movements were cumbersome, they could cover a huge distance with a single step. For them, a span of hundreds of thousands of feet was only a few steps.</p>

  <p>The mist creatures drifted forward...</p>

  <p>The blue haired spirit and the golden-horned bull-headed man also became anxious.</p>

  <p>They hadn't even considered that the brown powder in their opponents' hands could be fake!</p>

  <p>In particular, the blue-haired spirit wanted to slap herself a few times. After all, she had suffered the effects of the Bone-coagulating Powder before, and she should have considered this possibility in advance.</p>

  <p>However, they still had a chance. Anyway, Zheng and his group couldn't escape.</p>

  <p>But it never occurred to them that their thinking was flawed.</p>

  <p>As the warriors from many races began their headlong rush, a hint of green arose from the Purple Wind Gorge.</p>

  <p>At the same time, wisps of purple wind stirred from the Purple Wind Gorge.</p>

  <p>These purple winds were the most lethal catchers on the Grand Pure Realm, but they couldn't capture the green shadow.</p>

  <p>Only once the green shadow had completely risen did the warriors from many races see its form clearly.</p>

  <p>It was a huge hawk!</p>

  <p>His feathers, which looked as if they were carved out of jade, were crystal clear, fluttering in the wind.</p>

  <p>As the purple wind howled closer, it actually swept over the hawk's feathers; however, it could do nothing to the giant hawk…</p>

  <p>"The Wing King!"</p>

  <p>When Pearson saw the huge creature, he became very excited.</p>

  <p>It was strange that Pearson was familiar with the Wing King, but on second thought, it made perfect sense to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization that the Wing King once led had also been a mighty ruling civilization. However, following the battle with the Nihility race, he had been left no choice but to lead the Regal Jade Civilization to hide away in the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Their choices were identical to those of the human race, but there were still more human elites trapped on the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others saw this huge hawk, which seemed to be carved from jade, their eyes widened with awe. He could freely soar in the Purple Wind Gorge. Was this where Zheng's confidence came from?</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>The Wing King stretched out his pair of razor talons and grabbed the Heavenly Eye Vine, like a hawk catching a snake. The difference was that the Heavenly Eye Vine was unequivocal about its own situation and remained compliantly motionless.</p>

  <p>"Stop that bird!"</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak…</p>

  <p>The Terror Mice roared and hurled their weapons at the giant hawk in a frenzy.</p>

  <p>The mist creatures also twirled their black hooks, trying to grapple with Zheng and the others and bring them back...</p>

  <p>Seeing that these warriors of the various races were all attacking ferociously, the Wing King flapped his great wings and flew hard ahead.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Strong winds suddenly and violently blew on the seventh stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau.</p>

  <p>If it had just been a gust of wind, it wouldn't have mattered. The warriors present weren't afraid of the Wing King.</p>

  <p>Over the years, they had encountered many powerful warriors from the ruling civilizations.</p>

  <p>The problem was that this was the Purple Wind Gorge!</p>

  <p>It was unquestionable that the Wing King could avoid the purple wind.</p>

  <p>What escalated the situation was that when he beat his wings powerfully to create a strong wind, he inevitably attracted the purple wind from the Purple Wind Gorge to rear up at the same time!</p>

  <p>Almost all of the warriors now had terror in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Earlier, those daredevils had been fortunate to survive, but now that they had rushed to the front, they couldn't avoid the purple wind this time.</p>

  <p>The purple wind draped around the daredevils like silk and dragged them towards the Purple Wind Gorge.</p>

  <p>It wasn't merely the group of daredevils who proved unlucky. The Terror Mice and the mist creatures who had just rushed forward were also tangled in the purple wind.</p>

  <p>No matter the length of their struggles or what theurgy they used, none could break free.</p>

  <p>Noticing how unfavorable the situation was for them, the warriors from other races could only beat a hot retreat. In the end, they could only watch the Wing King rise into the air and flap off towards the Purple Wind Gorge...</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The purple wind in the Purple Wind Gorge was like a silken banner which had its own awareness, and it was crazily chasing after the Wing King.</p>

  <p>However, the Wing King was very familiar with the patterns of the purple wind, so he didn't struggle to avoid them. The purple wind couldn't touch him at all, and of course, it couldn't touch the Heavenly Eye Vine in his claws either.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you scared me! I didn't expect you to possess such a trump card."</p>

  <p>Fuxi gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the others also felt intense relief. The Snake Goddess had believed that it would be the Primeval Lord of Heaven who would make a move, but she didn't expect the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization would come.</p>

  <p>The top of the Heavenly Eye Vine was lifted high, and Pearson was standing at the top, speaking with the Wing King.</p>

  <p>Thurston and Sawyer had just allayed the crowd's doubts.</p>

  <p>When the Regal Jade Civilization had explored the Grand Pure Realm back then, there had once been a Regal Jade Spirit who became lost.</p>

  <p>Later, the Wing King led their race to escape and hide in Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit that went missing didn't know about it, so he became a stray of the Regal Jade Civilization, wandering outside.</p>

  <p>By chance, this Regal Jade Spirit had become an Eternal Realm Hunter. He had a good relationship with Pearson, and they were as close to each other as brothers.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this Regal Jade Spirit died at the hands of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Before he died, he entrusted Pearson to help him find the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>It had proven impossible for Pearson, who had continuously been exploring the Three Purities Stage, to find the Regal Jade Civilization that had been hiding on Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>However, Pearson hadn't expected that he would meet the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization at this time. It was not difficult to imagine how excited he was.</p>
