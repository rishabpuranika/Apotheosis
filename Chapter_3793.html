  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Winchell guessed that it was Zheng before them, he still stood his ground and dared not greet him.</p>

  <p>Zheng then came forward with his hands respectfully cupped in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Master Winchell, sorry for being late."</p>

  <p>"It really is Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"We're out of danger now!"</p>

  <p>"I thought we were doomed!"</p>

  <p>The five Holy Soul Realm warriors breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Winchell also smiled and bowed towards Zheng. "It is fortunate that you were able to get here just in time. You've saved us all, Zheng."</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and hurriedly went to his side. "Master Winchell, you've risked so much to help me look for the Heavy Stone. I should be the one thanking you."</p>

  <p>Winchell shook his head. "The Oneness Sky Palace owes you so much, and the Origin Mountain even more. You've grown so powerful and there's little we can do to help you. I am thankful that this was within our ability to do for you."</p>

  <p>When he finished speaking, he handed a round stone over to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"A Heavy Stone?" Zheng muttered, turning the stone over in his hand curiously.</p>

  <p>Winchell simply nodded as he took the stone from him.</p>

  <p>"With this stone, you'll be able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting when the time comes," he told Zheng. "However, your Soul of Light needs to ascend to this stage first."</p>

  <p>In order to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, one's soul needed to be integrated with the physical form, and his Soul of Light remained at a lower stage.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had already cleared the path from the Blooming Jade Stage to the Grand Plain Stage so there wouldn't be any problems for him to enter the latter.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fire Emissary, Pearce, and the others simply waited on the bronze ground. Nobody talked and there was not a peep, not even a whisper amongst them. An hour later, the silence was broken by a few gasps as a streak of white light swept across the bronze ground. The relief sculptures immediately changed before their very eyes.</p>

  <p>When the current scene in the forest appeared, Pearce and the others all heaved sighs of relief.</p>

  <p>The figures of the Other Shore creatures couldn't be seen that easily since the picture was so small but they could distinguish their broken limbs if they looked hard enough.</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary smiled when he saw this before he turned around and left.</p>

  <p>Pearce could only stare at Fire Emissary's back, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>He initially thought that the Element Spirit race left behind some traps in the stone forest.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, they didn't seem to have done so.</p>

  <p>What did the Fire Emissary seek to gain when he did this? Was it just truly to send the members of the three Other Shore races to their deaths?</p>

  <p>True, these three Other Shore races were weak and had no Eternal Realm master so why would the Element Spirit race suddenly decide to kill all of them? For sheer entertainment? That couldn't be it.</p>

  <p>Just as Pearce continued to mull this over, a white vortex suddenly appeared beside him. From the vortex came forth Zheng, Winchell, and the rest of their brethren.</p>

  <p>"Winchell!" Pearce shouted in glee at the sight.</p>

  <p>Winchell gave him a smile and a polite bow. As he stood up, his eyes also caught the Fire Emissary's retreating back. "Pearce, this is too weird!"</p>

  <p>"I think so too," Auden chimed in. "That's not the only issue. Haven't you noticed? The Element Spirit race's actions against Zheng have been extremely weird."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes gleamed with apprehension upon hearing Auden's words.</p>

  <p>If the Element Spirit race was indeed in such a hurry to obtain the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits and stop Zheng from entering Stage Thirty-three then they should've gathered all their strength in order to deal him the killing blow. If it truly mattered so much then why didn't Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and the Chaos Ancient God behind them take action?</p>

  <p>Their forces in the Source World chose to stay put and, even if they attacked Zheng several times on the Other Shore, they never really made any trouble for him. The Element Spirit race was holding back.</p>

  <p>This last attack couldn't even be called a proper offense. Everything smelled fishy.</p>

  <p>A noticeable frown was plastered on Pearce's face. "What is their true purpose?"</p>

  <p>Zheng could only sigh in resignation. "I'm afraid the Element Spirit race are the only ones who truly know."</p>

  <p>Pearce huffed proudly in response. "No matter!" he declared. "You'll be able to reach the Eternal Realm in the near future since you've obtained the Heavy Stone! It doesn't matter what kind of wicked scheme the Element Spirit race is brewing."</p>

  <p>As of the moment, Zheng had obtained eighteen imprints in total. So long as he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting with no problems then he was set on his way to becoming an Eternal Warrior. He was now strong enough to kill the Blood Spirit Tortoise and once he reached the Eternal Realm, he would finally gain the ability to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.</p>

  <p>Once Fire Emissary left, he began to cross over hundreds of miles on the bronze ground.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he came to a halt in front of a strangely-shaped relief.</p>

  <p>In front of him was the relief of a circular, blood-red building— the Blood Assembly, the Element Spirit race's base camp in the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary took out a Light Stone and lightly tapped it on the ground, creating a white vortex that he could use to enter the world within the relief.</p>

  <p>Given his status and identity, he was not actually qualified to enter the Blood Assembly. Only those like Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer were given such high privilege.</p>

  <p>Thus, Fire Emissary had no choice but to relay everything to a Moon Fire Slave who would then deliver his message to the higher-ups.</p>

  <p>Not long after...</p>

  <p>A small orb appeared in the innermost part of the Blood Assembly. This orb was made up of pure elements and had a small flame floating inside it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The flame continuously changed, rising and falling before it finally took on the shape of a human woman.</p>

  <p>So long as they wanted, the Element Spirit race could change into any form.</p>

  <p>This was one of their abilities: complete transformation.</p>

  <p>In the past, the race strictly regulated the form its members took, however, time softened such restrictions until all of them were eventually lifted.</p>

  <p>Thus, more and more race members began to take on more unique shapes and a large number of them preferred human forms.</p>

  <p>This particular race member was one of those who preferred the human form and the one she transformed into seemed a bit similar to the Snake Goddess, though she evidently looked more mischievous.</p>

  <p>She merely floated within the orb and looked up at the top of the space.</p>

  <p>"Les, what did you call me for?"</p>

  <p>At the top of the space, directly above her, was a circular mirror and within it was another member of the Element Spirit race— a thunder spirit.</p>

  <p>Les, the thunder spirit, looked at the fire spirit with sharp, raging eyes. "I've just received the reports. What the hell did you do, Claire?!"</p>

  <p>Claire merely blinked and a small smile made its way to her lips. "Carrying out the task given to me by the great Eye Spirit!" she declared proudly.</p>

  <p>Les looked like he was on the brink of exploding. "Eye Spirit ordered you to kill that human brat!"</p>

  <p>There had been a lot of troubles at Stage Thirty-three recently and there was a need for the powerful Element Spirit race to deal with them carefully, thus, they handed the other, less significant matters over to Claire.</p>

  <p>When Les received a series of reports detailing Claire's failed attempts at killing Zheng, he was naturally furious. Claire obviously wasn't taking her job seriously.</p>

  <p>They were bound to be a laughingstock if people found out that the almighty Element Spirit race couldn't even deal with one human boy.</p>

  <p>"Eye Spirit doesn't really want to kill the human," Claire muttered with a pout.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap!" Les snapped. He was overcome with emotions and a terrifying aura engulfed his surroundings as bolts of lightning began to emanate from his orb.</p>

  <p>Claire huffed. "I'm serious! Nine Holy Soul Imprints and nine Bone Tribulation Imprints! This human is the first-ever creature to have received so many and he deserves our expectations."</p>
