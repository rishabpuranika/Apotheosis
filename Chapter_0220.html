<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Nevertheless, all reason to sympathize was lost when he remembered that she had been keeping him in such a confined space for such a long time.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'll have a try!"</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng took two steps toward the edge of the Blood Prison Enchantment, found a proper position, and began to launch his demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>According to the nature of the demonic life energy, a trace of it was more than enough to make his plan work. As long as it could consume the bloody aura from within, the amount of the demonic life energy would shoot up.</p>

  <p>Finally, Zheng took a deep breath and threw a punch at the Blood Prison Enchantment.</p>

  <p>With the Emerald Crystal's red energy, he made a small gap in the enchantment. Immediately as he had expected, the bloody aura repaired the gap with visible speed. The result was a clear repeat of earlier, but with one exception.</p>

  <p>In this instance, he had injected a wisp of the demonic life energy into it, which quickly spread like a dye in the water.</p>

  <p>When the bloody aura surrounded the demonic life energy, the demonic life energy began to counter and devoured it like no tomorrow. It seemed that the tables had been turned!</p>

  <p>The demonic life energy spread quickly, and more rapidly. Then a fist-sized black blob appeared on the Blood Prison Enchantment, and a small patch of it turned black-purple. After what felt like a few minutes, the entire Blood Prison Enchantment finally turned all black-purple.</p>

  <p>'Yes!' thought Zheng elatedly. It meant that he was in charge of the whole enchantment!</p>

  <p>Before anyone else realized what was happening, he tapped his finger gently on the Blood Prison Enchantment and shouted, "Break!"</p>

  <p>As soon as it received Zheng's order, the demonic life energy in the Blood Prison Enchantment promptly dissipated between heaven and earth. It did not take long before he completely broke the Blood Prison Enchantment.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the imperial soldiers who were watching widened in great surprise. No one could believe what he or she was seeing.</p>

  <p>Evidently, a man only half-step into the nature level had shattered the renowned Blood Prison Enchantment!</p>

  <p>Everyone in the imperial army knew about the illustrious legend of Yolande's Blood Prison Enchantment. Two years ago, during a war at the Heaven and Earth towers, the girl single-handedly trapped three ordinary demon kings with it!</p>

  <p>Albeit these three demons were not as powerful as the demon kings, Oceiros and Aldrich, they were still demon kings nonetheless! What was even more remarkable about this feat was that she trapped all three at once!</p>

  <p>The siege of the three demon kings turned the war around. Imperial soldiers in the Illuminating Soul Realm cornered a powerful demon king and killed the three ordinary demon kings. Such an achievement provided a knockout blow to the demon army!</p>

  <p>During that time, not only did Yolande round up the three ordinary demon kings, but she also valiantly defeated more than 3, 000 demon soldiers and generals. Ever since then, people called her the "Killer Girl" and the label had been widely known in White Emperor City. Soldiers who had participated in the war could clearly remember how bewitching and beautiful she was in her white dress stained with demon blood.</p>

  <p>Still, a question remained in everyone's mind. Who was the man who had just broken through Yolande's Blood Prison Enchantment?</p>

  <p>He wore a robe of an outer disciple of the Cloud Sect. Being half-step into the nature level, the man was just as strong as a centurion in the imperial army. The soldiers failed to fathom how a man of such low caliber had broken the enchantment.</p>

  <p>Could Yolande have let him win?</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, they dismissed this speculation. Although they were unlikely to encounter big shots like Yolande, they had heard many stories about her. According to old rumors about her personality, it seemed impossible for the girl to lose on purpose.</p>

  <p>As the Blood Prison Enchantment disappeared, Zheng approached Yolande with a bright smile and said, "Remember your promise? Now give me my reward."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Yolande said with a nod. "Don't talk nonsense. Just tell me what you want."</p>

  <p>"Well, then… Give me a kiss?" he said casually, pointing to his face.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's words, the soldiers around him nearly picked their ears on instinct. The man's words came as a bolt from the blue. With such an odd request for a reward, they wondered if they had heard him wrong. Not only was this person skilled, but he was also incredibly bold.</p>

  <p>Despite the girl's reputation, he had the nerve to flirt with Yolande in front of everyone!</p>

  <p>More than that, the powerful girl's promise was precious, but this man spoiled it with such a trivial thing as a kiss!</p>

  <p>With a strange look on her face, Yolande blinked and said, "This request is too simple, I can do much more than this. Think it over and change it."</p>

  <p>"No, this request is good enough," Zheng replied, smiling and bending his face close to hers.</p>

  <p>While looking at Zheng, Yolande scowled as though she did not understand his logic. Then quietly, she walked towards the man, stopped in front of him, and tiptoed on the small clogs while leaning close to him.</p>

  <p>A soothing fragrance overpowered his senses as the girl drew closer; her moist lips touched his cheek as light as a chicken's peck and then quickly moved away from him.</p>

  <p>Even though she did not turn a hair, she did not say anything else and left to retreat to her room.</p>

  <p>As soon as Yolande was back in her room, she sat on the futon used for her daily training. Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes and tried to practice. To her surprise, she felt restless, which was a first as it was not in her nature to feel that way.</p>

  <p>Bending her long legs, she rested an arm on the colorful dress while the other played with the hem. As her frown deepened, she stared blankly out of the window. "That's so strange. Why is my heart racing?" she murmured, sounding confused.</p>
