<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2257 Power Shaping </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors in the divine land had a thorough understanding of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Each of the Divine Dao was a mature and complete system unto itself.</p>

  <p>But after years and years of hard research, a few talents had cut the internal momentum in the Divine Dao, and with their comprehension, had created their own cultivation method. For example, Holy Jay's Ice Soul Flame and Yazid's Five Elements Destructing.</p>

  <p>This type of cultivation method was known as the 'token beyond way', which was a token beyond the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Some theurgies were extremely powerful, such as the Ice Soul Flame. So far, there had been a countless number of True Gods who had wanted to take Holy Jay as their master so that they could practice the Ice Soul Flame.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Destructing was relatively ordinary and wasn't any more powerful than the token of the Five Elements Divine Dao. It was better to spend time on cultivating the Five Elements Divine Dao than to the former, which was why the True Gods considered the Five Elements Destructing as ordinary and weren't interested in it.</p>

  <p>The argument between supporters of the token beyond way and that of the Divine Dao was a lasting one. Some people said that the Divine Dao were the foundation of the divine land and that they should focus on cultivating the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>But there were also people who said that the token beyond way was the future of the divine land. Strong creatures had deliberately created the 3000 Divine Dao. A greater chaos still existed outside the divine land, and being limited by the 3000 Divine Dao was not a good thing.</p>

  <p>This argument was still ongoing with no conclusion in sight.</p>

  <p>"The preciousness of the Might Divine Dao is the single use of brute strength and is very powerful. Because the strength source can morph into various shapes, the effect is very direct. This is the natural advantage that the Might Divine Dao has over other Divine Dao," Joy said, waving her hand gently at the purple sky.</p>

  <p>A sudden splash sounded and the snake-like giant beasts in the purple mist surged in one direction and disappeared before anyone could blink.</p>

  <p>At the same time, twenty-one purple stars appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng counted for a few seconds before he asked, "Shouldn't there be only nine stars? Why are there twenty-one?"</p>

  <p>Joy smiled. There were nine sparkling lights among the twenty-one purple stars. They were beautiful and reflected different colors as gems under the sun.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that it was the color of the strength source. There were nine similarly colored stars in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's nine stars were a little smaller than those of Joy, but they were only a quarter smaller than them. Luo Luo Zheng had only absorbed one third of the strength source from Holy Jay, which meant that although Joy had Nine Divine Stars that had also been absorbed by the Purple Sky Land, her strength source was still less than that of ordinary Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>As Joy waved her hand, wisps of invisible power descended from the deep sky.</p>

  <p>The waves of power were normally colorless and invisible.</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Luo Zheng could hurt Langston was because of the sword that was made of the invisible power. Langston hadn't noticed it at the most critical moment and had almost gotten his head pierced by the sword.</p>

  <p>In fact, the two fights that Luo Luo Zheng had had with Langston and Sheridan also confused many people from the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>They didn't know how Luo Luo Zheng had used the invisible power, and what kind of a Divine Dao he was cultivating.</p>

  <p>After all, they couldn't even imagine that a proving godly warrior could use the Cross-world token to extract pure strength out of his body.</p>

  <p>Mist was present all the time, shrouding the Purple Sky Land. The invisible power was so conspicuous due to the mist that it revealed the outline of the power.</p>

  <p>Under Joy's control, the invisible power had descended quickly. It could push the purple mist and transform into all kinds of shapes, including those of humans, dragons, and phoenixes.</p>

  <p>At this, Luo Zheng's eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could do the same. With the Cross-world token, he could easily master his strength and turn the strength into various shapes. But he could only shift the strength into one shape at a time.</p>

  <p>"This is a token beyond way that is comprehended from the Might Divine Dao. It is usually called 'Power Shaping'." Joy continued, "In fact, warriors can perform the lowest level of the Power Shaping ever since their Eighth Path Platforms are activated."</p>

  <p>The most primitive power was that from the martial artist's body. When fighting against an opponent, one would have to exhaust the strength in their muscles and meridians first.</p>

  <p>When the Eight Path Platforms were activated, extra power was condensed in the Path Platforms. When a body refiner needed power, they could extract it from the Eight Path Platforms and pass it to their hands through their meridians.</p>

  <p>This was the most basic Power Shaping that shaped the power into a liquid and quickly spread it to the position that the warrior needed along the meridians.</p>

  <p>"The Power Shaping?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, pursing his lips. He didn't expect everyone to have the ability of activating the Power Shaping.</p>

  <p>Joy glanced at Luo Luo Zheng and explained, "It's the lowest level and can't force your strength out of your body. Once you completely learn Power Shaping, you can greatly enhance your ability to defend against the enemy."</p>

  <p>She flicked a slender finger and five invisible forces emerged from each of her fingertips, extending about an inch, like several sharp and invisible fingernails. .</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned and remained speechless for a long time.</p>

  <p>He had the Cross-world token and what Joy had just done was a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Joy hadn't been present when Luo Luo Zheng had fought Langston, or she wouldn't have bothered to explain everything to him so carefully. "The most powerful method of the Power Shaping is to use the Cross-world token to transform power into infinite shapes, which is almost impossible for the opponent to guard against. The Power Shaping is divided into three stages. I will teach you the first stage, which is all about how to force the power out of your body."</p>

  <p>The first stage of the Power Shaping was to shape the power and extend the strength as a part of one's own body, like the invisible fingertips that Joy had made. When one had perfectly mastered this method, they could attack their opponent before the opponent could even react.</p>

  <p>In the second stage, one could extend the power even further and twist it into a simple shape.</p>

  <p>The third stage was the most complex of all and it involved turning power into an independent subject and control the subject. The power was the strongest in this stage, but the conditions were most severe. Only those who had the Cross-world token could use it freely and that meant that this was an ability exclusive to Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was placed somewhere between the second and the third stages.</p>

  <p>With the Cross-world token, he could easily turn the power into simple shapes, but his movements were not as flexible as Joy's.</p>

  <p>Joy was about to teach him the basic principles but Luo Luo Zheng spoke up.</p>

  <p>"Master, is this the first stage?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thrust his fist forward, a pure force gushing out of it and breaking through the purple mist in front of him. It formed an outline of his fist.</p>

  <p>Joy remained calm at this, and said, "If you have comprehended the method of Power Shaping, why didn't I see you use it in the Arena of Legends?"</p>

  <p>Since he was so talented, it wasn't strange to Joy that Luo Luo Zheng had mastered this by himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't answer. He continued demonstrating and said, "Is this the second stage?" He shook his fist slightly and waved his hand in the purple mist. Gradually, the outline of a long sword appeared in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Only now did Joy show any semblance of surprise. She hadn't thought that Luo Luo Zheng, a proving godly warrior, could have cultivated the Power Shaping to such a high level.</p>

  <p>In fact, without the Cross-world token, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't have learnt anything about Power Shaping. After all, Power Shaping was just one feature of the Cross-world token.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grinned at Joy and grabbed the invisible sword. With a gentle wave, the sword flew into the purple mist and back, leaving a clear trail in the mist.</p>

  <p>"Is this the third stage?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, turning to look at Joy.</p>
