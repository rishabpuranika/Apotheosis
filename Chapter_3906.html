  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite having spent so much effort, Gerald had failed to suppress the bloodline within Zheng's body— it was rather embarrassing.</p>

  <p>All he knew was that Zheng had fused with a powerful bloodline, but he couldn't tell the bloodline's grade or rank in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and Zheng hadn't given him all the information.</p>

  <p>"The power of the bloodline is simply inconceivable." After a moment of being awestruck, Gerald insisted on giving it another go. "I'll call Judson over to help!"</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, it seemed he wouldn't stop until he managed to help Zheng suppress his bloodline.</p>

  <p>After hearing what Gerald asked him to do, Judson also showed great interest.</p>

  <p>It was because of their special bloodlines that the Chaos Ancient Gods were all powerful. Naturally, they were highly concerned about other unique and powerful bloodlines as well.</p>

  <p>Once Judson came over, he discussed the matter with Gerald. The two then worked together to suppress Zheng's bloodline, but with disappointing results.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline remained at the top in terms of energy level, and it could work out energy that restrained the enemy's energy, accomplishing a great task with little effort by clever maneuvers.</p>

  <p>Although they tried both the internal and external forces, neither of them worked.</p>

  <p>This time around, even the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't know what to do with it.</p>

  <p>"When I first entered the Supreme Pure Realm, I encountered over a hundred crises. Sometimes, even after trying every single available means, I still couldn't overcome certain obstacles," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "But at the time, I didn't complain. It was my first time entering the Supreme Pure Realm. Everything was so strange...I needed to explore it all step by step, even fighting with my life..."</p>

  <p>Entering a strange domain meant coming across more unknown difficulties and dangers, but he also gained much from it.</p>

  <p>Zheng's ancestry-level bloodline was truly powerful.</p>

  <p>No one in even the Four Spirits Sect had obtained the complete ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>This 'unknown' served as a great test for Zheng, as well as a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>As for how to control the ancestry-level bloodline, all he could do was explore step by step.</p>

  <p>After returning to the Dark Haze Peak, Zheng tried communicating with the ancestry-level bloodline to see if there was any turn of events.</p>

  <p>In the Victory Province beside the Pear Hill were many black ships in a row.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship's captain stood at the bow along with the Grandmaster of Heaven, followed by the other members of the Black Ship. All of them wore serious expressions.</p>

  <p>"Will Othniel play tricks?" the captain asked uneasily.</p>

  <p>The pair had made a vow through the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake. According to the vow, Othniel wouldn't attack the Grandmaster of Heaven before they took down the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Instead, their agreement entailed they would attack the Pear Hill together.</p>

  <p>But as the Grandmaster of Heaven just arrived with the Black Ship members in the Victory Province, Judson, another Chaos Ancient God, had also arrived at the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Even with two Chaos Ancient Gods guarding the Pear Hill, the Grandmaster of Heaven had still decided to make a move until Othniel stopped him.</p>

  <p>According to the latter, the Pear Hill likely had an extremely powerful trump card. Now that it had the two Chaos Ancient Gods supporting them, he was afraid they'd suffer losses if they acted too rashly. At this point, he had already summoned another couple of Chaos Ancient Gods for help— Herbert and Lamont.</p>

  <p>The three Chaos Ancient Gods followed the Purge Way, meaning they remained on the Element Spirit race's side.</p>

  <p>The three of them gathering meant a great threat to the Nihility race. Even the Grandmaster of Heaven would find it difficult to deal with them— it was rather worrying.</p>

  <p>As Othniel called for help, the Pear Hill also called for strong reinforcements.</p>

  <p>In the past couple of days, the captain of the Black Ship already felt a few strong space fluctuations— it was obvious that some powerful warriors had arrived at the Pear Hill through space channels.</p>

  <p>Among the three parties, they were the only ones lacking strong reinforcements. The longer they waited, the greater their disadvantage was.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven seemed very calm, even a little relaxed.</p>

  <p>"The conflict between them is greater," said the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"There is no need for us to rush along and steal the show."</p>

  <p>A battle was inevitable between those who believed in the Purge Way and those who believed in the Finale Way— these opposing forces produced the greatest conflict in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Initially, the Grandmaster of Heaven descended to the Source World in quite a hurry, but he finally figured things out.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race didn't need to be all that anxious about a fight.</p>

  <p>While they kept their voices low in the conversation, the Evil God was near enough to pick it up— they hadn't considered having to hide anything from him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God seemed focused on finding the tentacle, indifferent to anything else.</p>

  <p>But behind his demeanor, he had his own plans.</p>

  <p>And he decided it was likely the best time to carry them out.</p>

  <p>Everything worked to his advantage now. He had completely got rid of Zheng's control and he had devoured Usman. Moreover, he had the chance to take advantage of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>It was his goal to grow stronger in the shortest time possible before finding the perfect opportunity to control everything there, including this powerful being.</p>

  <p>The Evil God gazed at the Grandmaster of Heaven from behind, malice filling his eyes.</p>

  <p>In the Taoism Province, west of the Pear Hill…</p>

  <p>The Taoism Province was very close to the Pear Hill and was ruled by the Pear Hill. Many humans lived across the area— it had countries, cities, and villages.</p>

  <p>The people of the Taoism Province raised their heads to look up at the sky.</p>

  <p>In the boundless blue, they found a twisted silhouette, as though someone had twisted the very sky into a pretzel.</p>

  <p>While there was nothing concrete, so long as they looked up, they could feel the pressure.</p>

  <p>If someone used Grand Teleportation to get into the space channel for observation, they'd find an enormous body nearly ten million feet high hidden within— it was Othniel hiding in there.</p>

  <p>His means of hiding wasn't anything impressive, but he never intended to hide well in the first place.</p>

  <p>Herbert and Lamont both rushed over— the moment either of them arrived, Othniel would make a move.</p>

  <p>While waiting, Othniel also contacted the Divine Farmer to ask for the necessary support from the Element Spirit race. The latter delivered the Element Spirit race's message, telling him that they would take action at the most critical moment.</p>

  <p>But Othniel could sense the bitterness in the Divine Farmer's tone.</p>

  <p>While Claire had previously been killed by Gerald's Poison of Decomposition, she hadn't truly died. But it affected Yellow Thearch, nearly killing him.</p>

  <p>If the Element Spirit race still wanted to directly participate in the war, the Divine Farmer himself was going to be the next victim— it was definitely not something the Divine Farmer was willing to see.</p>

  <p>But at this point, he had no choice.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A strangely-shaped cage suddenly appeared in the air above the Taoism Province.</p>

  <p>Its structure was truly exquisite, like a well-crafted artwork.</p>

  <p>A space fluctuation emerged from it before a great figure appeared— it was none other than Herbert, one of the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>He had no intention to hide his arrival whatsoever. When his great body left the cage, his aura spread in all directions like an invisible storm, wandering throughout the entire Taoism Province.</p>

  <p>The aura contained a form of truth energy that could imprison everything— all the living beings in the entire province were suppressed, left unable to breathe.</p>

  <p>"This day arrived earlier than I expected," Herbert said slowly.</p>

  <p>His stand was not as firm as Lamont's or Othniel's.</p>

  <p>For so long, he had Fuxi trapped, giving him the chance to persuade him to change side, but the latter failed.</p>
