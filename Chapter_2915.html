<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2915 Fight For The Holy Springs </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Each time the Mountain of Holy Beings came, a disaster would dawn on the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>In order to fight for a holy spring, everyone would spare no effort.</p>

  <p>Anyone who would reach the consummation of True God Realm was by no means ordinary. As they knew that they only needed to go one step further to reach the peak of the world, the attraction was irresistible to them.</p>

  <p>Flying his way to reach the holy spring, Luo Zheng could already see how it was getting closer to him.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Like mercury, the shiny silver water came out of the holy spring. However, mercury was viscous, while the silver water flowed quickly.</p>

  <p>Flowing down the ground, the silver water rushed to the center of the spring on a low terrain, quickly forming a silver pool.</p>

  <p>Sauntering towards it, Luo Zheng was now a thousand feet away from the holy spring. Suddenly, the surface of the pool fluctuated.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>Bubbles started to appear on top of the silver pool.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, a silver head came out of the water, followed by neck, body and legs.</p>

  <p>Soon, a complete human body rose from the spring water.</p>

  <p>Leaving the pool, it rushed straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is this the test of the holy spring?" Luo Zheng tried his best to remain calm.</p>

  <p>He knew that to occupy a holy spring, one had to be ready to fight both the other challengers and the holy spring itself.</p>

  <p>Seeing the silver man coming straight for him, Luo Zheng didn't even need to dodge. With a flick of his finger, a red lotus bloomed from his fingertip, immediately sweeping towards the silver man.</p>

  <p>If the silver man was made of energy, the attack of the red lotus should do the trick.</p>

  <p>Da!</p>

  <p>With the red lotus wrapping all over its body, the silver man didn't seem worried. Stretching out its hand, it tore the red lotus off.</p>

  <p>"It can't be transformed."</p>

  <p>With this conclusion, Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly. It seemed that the silver man's strength was coming from the body of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Mountain of Holy Beings had been here for countless years, but neither Holy Beings nor warriors at the Other Shore Realm were able to enter it.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was because it contained an unbeatable treasure, or it was an extremely powerful treasure on its own.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts, the silver man jumped up and rushed towards Luo Zheng with a fist.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The fist came at utmost speed that exceeded Luo Zheng's expectations, the space around it faintly showing signs of cracking.</p>

  <p>Seeing the silver fist coming for him, Luo Zheng punched it without dodging.</p>

  <p>He had extracted most of his strength, with a flash of nine stars in his body.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A strange color flashed across Luo Zheng's eyes as he endured the attack, urging him to take a step back. He then flew backward.</p>

  <p>In the battle requiring pure strength, he was actually at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>However, the impact had his fist glowing with a layer of golden light.</p>

  <p>A stream of mysterious Truth of Godly Way was released by the golden light. Even No. 9527 couldn't explain where it came from. Although the impact was strong enough to send Luo Zheng flying, his golden light curled the silver man and sliced it into several pieces instantly like a high-speed sharp sword.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The pieces of the silver man immediately turned into silver water and converged in the pool.</p>

  <p>Standing still in the air, Luo Zheng clenched his numb fist.</p>

  <p>As he approached the pool again, he could see two silver men crawling out of the water. Their bodies were embedded with a layer of armor, making them much stronger than the first one.</p>

  <p>Like the first attacker, they rushed quickly towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Sword Chen looked cautious.</p>

  <p>Although no one fought with him for the holy spring, he knew it wasn't easy to obtain it.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Zheng's case, a silver man climbed out from beneath the holy spring when he approached it. But this time, the silver man was holding a long silver sword in its hand.</p>

  <p>The silver man was not as mighty as the one that Luo Zheng had encountered, but it had excellent swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the silver man gently lifted its silver sword, a stream of silver sword radiance turned into a fine net and enveloped Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's eyes narrowed slightly before they went dark. Slashing his long sword in the air, he created a sword net to cover the silver man.</p>

  <p>The two sword nets collided.</p>

  <p>Immediately cutting off each other, the well-arranged sword nets turned into messy sword threads.</p>

  <p>The expression on Sword Chen's face changed slightly as he observed what happened. These messy sword threads were irregular, making it more difficult for him to dodge them.</p>

  <p>Jumping to a somersault, he tried to dodge through the gaps in between, but one of the sword threads cut his body, leaving a long and narrow wound on his abdomen.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the silver man was directly cut by several sword threads.</p>

  <p>Half of its head rolled into the silver pool, while its whole body melted.</p>

  <p>But before Sword Chen could let out a sigh of relief, another two silver men appeared from the pool, each holding a sword in their hands.</p>

  <p>The situation was much more tragic around the other three holy springs.</p>

  <p>Whenever the warriors approached the holy springs, a certain number of silver men appeared to face them.</p>

  <p>If ten Demi-holy Beings approached a holy spring, then ten silver men would come out of it to meet them.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the silver men was actually not much of a big problem.</p>

  <p>However, since the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods would fight each other for the holy springs, that added up to the problem.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>"Bro, please help me! If I succeed in becoming a Holy Being, I will never forget your kindness!" A middle-aged man emitted a freezing aura. In front of him, a huge ice wall was erected. Countless ice spikes released by the silver man flew over from the other side of the ice wall.</p>

  <p>From a distance, a burly man sneered, "How about you help me become a Holy Being, and I will repay your kindness?"</p>

  <p>After becoming Holy Beings, they would be able to join the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>In fact, this was the ultimate goal of most of the strong warriors in the divine land. No one was willing to give up so easily.</p>

  <p>"No need to argue. You both can just go to hell. This holy spring belongs to me!" a Demi-holy Being from the Qin Clan answered.</p>

  <p>By nature, the Demi-holy Beings of the great clans were more powerful than the ordinary ones, so they were more domineering.</p>

  <p>The facial expressions of the first two warriors changed at those words.</p>

  <p>Quickly coming into an agreement, they gave up on getting close to the holy spring, and started moving towards the Demi-holy Being of the Qin Clan.</p>

  <p>The fights continued around the three holy springs.</p>

  <p>Some warriors died after being attacked by several others, while some had been injured and had to temporarily retreat to the side. After healing their wounds, they charged again to join the chaotic battle.</p>

  <p>During the fight happening in the Mountain of Holy Beings, a flying ship rushed out swiftly from the huge chaos clouds.</p>

  <p>Without the chaos clouds blocking their view, Clement and his group could see more clearly.</p>

  <p>"At last, we finally get out of that mess," sighed Clement.</p>

  <p>"Watch out. There is something ahead," warned Godfrey.</p>

  <p>Narrowing his eyes, Clement stared at the gem-shaped thing floating in the air.</p>
