<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng carefully folded the paper. He had completed writing down the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>He went to the first floor and handed the paper to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It's the complete version of the Truth Enlightenment," Luo Zheng said simply.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked, caught unaware. Sure enough, Luo Zheng had been able to decipher the whole Truth Enlightenment!</p>

  <p>Feng Ge would have been more shocked in the past.</p>

  <p>But she had spent enough time with him now to know amazing feats like this were just a matter of course to him.</p>

  <p>"The Taiyi Heaven Palace owns the Truth Enlightenment. I just translated it.</p>

  <p>So it should be your father who passes it down to the swordsmen in the world," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge carefully stowed the Truth Enlightenment away, pursing her lips as she realized she could not accompany Luo Zheng to where he headed next.</p>

  <p>She was the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Now that the Taiyi Heaven Palace was in danger, she couldn't just hide. But she had to go back to the Phoenix Palace before heading to the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>Having handed over the Truth Enlightenment to Feng Ge, Luo Zheng set off for the Dragon City with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>For a long time, the Dragon City had been a lively place.</p>

  <p>But in recent times, it had fallen into desolation.</p>

  <p>This was true both inside and outside the city.</p>

  <p>Most of the Taiyi Guards had been gathered in the Grand River Fortress when the Jin Wu attacked it. They fought with all their might, but still suffered heavy casualties in the end.</p>

  <p>The Flag Masters and the Alliance Chiefs posted outside the Dragon City had actually gone through numerous tests to become Taiyi Guards.</p>

  <p>But the rules were suddenly changed just a few days ago.</p>

  <p>People would be automatically qualified for the Taiyi Guards as long as they had participated in a certain amount of battles!</p>

  <p>This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for a vast majority. All the Alliance Chiefs and Flag Masters led their men to head in droves to the battlefield in hopes of meeting the qualifications.</p>

  <p>Thus, only a few remained posted outside the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>That was why when Luo Zheng arrived, he found, to his surprise, that his companions from the Sword Light Palace had been taken away.</p>

  <p>Even the weaker subordinates were taken away. The Taiyi Heaven Palace seemed to be in big trouble this time.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the Dragon Shadow Pavilion in the Dragon City, Luo Zheng and the Evil God showed their golden swords for verification. After Taiyi Guards checked them, they took them to the transmission array. They headed straight for the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>The North Unicorn Province's population was quite small although it was adjacent to the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>There were only 16 cities in the North Unicorn Province, and the total population of 15 of them was equal only to that of a medium-sized city beside the Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>There was only one big city in the whole province. It was called the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>The civilians from the North Mysterious City, however, had already evacuated to the Bloom Divine Province because of the war.</p>

  <p>The city was now being used as a stronghold for the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally arrived at the North Mysterious City through the space channel.</p>

  <p>Many Taiyi Guards bustled around. There were also a large number of Other Shore Realm warriors. A lot of them were only at the second or third stages of the Other Shore Realm based on their auras.</p>

  <p>While busy, they however, moved silently, a hardened look on their faces.</p>

  <p>The depressing atmosphere of the war loomed over everyone, though the bloodshed had not yet reached the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, disciples of the Land of Sword Grief. This way, please," a five-star Taiyi Guard said as he cupped his hands and bowed to Luo Zheng, the Evil God and other new arrivals.</p>

  <p>Those who had reached the Land of Sword Grief held very high positions in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. After all, even the weakest disciples of it had already reached the Desire World, when even the strongest five-star Taiyi Guards were unable to do so. If Taiyi Guards had reached the Desire World, they would have been taken to the Chaotic Source World last time.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Taiyi Guards highly respected the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards led Luo Zheng and the others through half of the city and to a large pavilion.</p>

  <p>Around 20 disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were already gathered there. Luo Zheng spotted a few familiar faces. Many of them were here after being mobilized by Goran.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Several disciples on the first floor greeted Luo Zheng. The disciples on the second floor merely glanced indifferently at him without saying anything.</p>

  <p>In their minds, Luo Zheng had progressed too fast. He might have defeated Rocco, but he had yet to earn their full admiration.</p>

  <p>In contrast, most of the disciples on the first floor owed much to Luo Zheng. Most of them had reached Stage Fourteen and received soul crystal in the Myriad Spirits City. They had also received a lot of benefits from the several races on the Other Shore. Luo Zheng's methods often shocked them, but they were grateful to him.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards advised Luo Zheng, the Evil God and the others to stay in the pavilion. Then they turned around and left.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know the situation on the battlefield in the North Unicorn Province, and he had just arrived. He was willing to wait here to be briefed.</p>

  <p>He soon found to his shock, however, that the others had already been waiting here for about 14 hours.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, the Taiyi Guards would bring newly arrived disciples from the Land of Sword Grief and then leave again. Some disciples had already demanded an explanation as to what they were waiting for, but they couldn't give a definite answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Evil God, however, remained patient. They just sat cross-legged in their seats without saying anything.</p>

  <p>Before long, more than 20 hours passed. They had been waiting there until the next morning.</p>

  <p>The disciples on the first floor and even some on the second floor couldn't bear it any longer.</p>

  <p>"We came to the North Unicorn Province in response to Master Goran's call. We could be killing Jin Wu by now! Why have we been left here?"</p>

  <p>"I heard the war in the North Unicorn Province was raging, but if they're too busy to take our help, maybe we should just leave them at it, on their own!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Several disciples were shouting now.</p>

  <p>Just then, a burly man entered the pavilion accompanied by several five-star Taiyi Guards.</p>

  <p>He was obviously a fighter, with his crew cut and his eyebrows arched like arrows. He gave off a murderous aura developed, clearly, from actual experience. The disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were powerful but they rarely killed, so even they didn't have this kind of aura.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been through a lot of deadly battles, though, so it didn't faze him.</p>

  <p>He looked the man up and down calmly.</p>

  <p>"Disciples from the Land of Sword Grief," the man said as he bowed to the crowd, "you are the top figures of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the treasures of the seven mountains, and the future hope of the Taiyi Heaven Palace!"</p>

  <p>The disciples who had grown impatient were somewhat appeased by the praise. They smiled smugly. This only lasted a moment.</p>

  <p>The man continued, "But no matter how valued you are and how strong you are, in my eyes, you are still useless. If you want to live, stop being so goddamned proud."</p>

  <p>The disciples' smiles froze on their faces. They glared daggers at this impudent man.</p>
