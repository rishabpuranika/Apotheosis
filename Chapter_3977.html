  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Woo... Hoo... Hoo..."</p>

  <p>A large group of members from the Sacred Horse race shouted from behind the leader, and their loud voices filled the air.</p>

  <p>They liked to move fast when they got excited. People saw twisted shadows as they galloped. Their bodies traversed distances at speeds that the naked eye could not see.</p>

  <p>This group from the Sacred Horse race moved in insane ways. They were like beams of light that dazzled everyone around them.</p>

  <p>However, their excitement did not last long.</p>

  <p>Pearson merely lifted his arm a little, but the spider threads had already formed a large net, which trapped all the members of the Sacred Horse race inside it.</p>

  <p>After the spider web wrapped around the members of the Sacred Horse race, who originally moved insanely fast, their speed drastically dropped at once. They also discovered that their theurgies became entirely ineffective.</p>

  <p>"It's your turn," Pearson said without looking back.</p>

  <p>Although he did not agree with Sawyer and Thurston's ideas, the three of them, who were Eternal Realm Hunters, had wandered on the Three Purities Stage for so long that they were like brothers.</p>

  <p>Since Sawyer and Thurston were so stubborn, Pearson had no choice but stand with them and fight.</p>

  <p>Sawyer and Thurston held their hands together, and the Black Sun suddenly appeared between the two of them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Black Sun spun rapidly and released an extraordinarily strong attraction force.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng could not resist the force, let alone these members of the Sacred Horse race.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm trapped in these spider threads!"</p>

  <p>"Why can't I use my bloodline power?"</p>

  <p>The members of the Sacred Horse race were in a mess. After all, how could they resist the terrifying power of the Black Sun?</p>

  <p>One by one, the Black Sun automatically sucked in the members of the Sacred Horse race. Some of the braver members of their race threw their spears before they got sucked in, but their efforts proved useless.</p>

  <p>Within nine seconds, the Black Sun sucked in all of the members of the Sacred Horse race.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others quietly looked at each other.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Eternal Realm Hunters deserved their reputation. They were formidable and mighty warriors.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Sawyer and Thurston withdrew their hands, and the Black Sun disappeared. Then, its exit closed.</p>

  <p>The Black Sun would consume the members of the Sacred Horse race inside it. Since their physical bodies were not that strong, it would not take long to eat them away.</p>

  <p>Then, Sawyer cupped his hands towards Luo Zheng and said, "The Element Spirit Civilization has marked you. Many races in the Grand Pure Realm have come to capture you from all directions, so you'd better leave here as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Will you go with us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Go with you?"</p>

  <p>"Okay..."</p>

  <p>Sawyer and Thurston didn't hesitate too much before they answered.</p>

  <p>The real reason the two of them joined the Eternal Realm Hunters was that they were homeless and had nowhere to go.</p>

  <p>Even though they had obtained great benefits after they became Eternal Realm Hunters, both of them still felt that the road ahead was long and meaningless.</p>

  <p>The Finale Way was the most meaningful goal that every ruling civilization pursued. However, in the many chaotic eras that passed, the two of them never found someone worthy of their support.</p>

  <p>Now, they both agreed that Luo Zheng was indeed the "special" one.</p>

  <p>Since they chose to give up the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, they naturally wanted to see if this person was worthy of their trust. "Then come with us!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Thurston and Sawyer jumped up and stood on the back of the Heavenly Eye Vine.</p>

  <p>"Pearson..." Sawyer looked back.</p>

  <p>If Pearson did not want to follow, then Sawyer wouldn't force him.</p>

  <p>Everyone had their ambitions, and the Eternal Realm Hunters were always free to pursue them.</p>

  <p>Then again, the three of them had gotten along well with each other for so many years, so of course, Pearson felt reluctant to leave them behind. With a bitter smile on his face, he jumped onto the Heavenly Eye Vine.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Eye Vine is usually covered with Arrow Demons. It's not easy to deal with them. Why would it help you?" Sawyer asked.</p>

  <p>In general, the Eternal Realm Hunters were quite familiar with everything about the Grand Pure Realm and the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons were also a non-human race that posed a high threat to the other races. Even the Eternal Realm Hunters had to avoid them when they encountered them before.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Eternal Realm Hunters found it strange when the Heavenly Eye Vine had now helped Luo Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>"They are dead. He killed them all," King Ieuan said as it pointed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thurston and Sawyer slightly arched their eyebrows at King Ieuan's words.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng had forcefully escaped from the Black Sun already shocked both of them. Thus, they were even more surprised when they heard that Luo Zheng could deal with the Arrow Demons all alone.</p>

  <p>Pearson pursed his lips. He was suspicious by nature. Unless he saw it with his own eyes, he never believed it.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the Heavenly Eye Vine went into the ground and quickly moved as it carried the people on it.</p>

  <p>When Claire, Les, and Slade saw what happened through the Shadow Warriors, they were also speechless.</p>

  <p>When the Eternal Realm Hunters first appeared, Claire and her companions were a little excited.</p>

  <p>Several years ago, Claire had personally tracked down the three remaining Eternal Realm Hunters, but she still failed to kill them.</p>

  <p>These Eternal Realm Hunters were undoubtedly all-powerful. If they weren't careful enough, even mighty warriors like Claire and Les could find their lives in danger.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Eternal Realm Hunters took action, Claire told Slade that if the Eternal Realm Hunters killed Luo Zheng and the others in his group, they would get the Bone Fragments Secret Soul as a reward.</p>

  <p>Even if there was hostility between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Eternal Realm Hunters, the Element Spirit Civilization never broke its promise.</p>

  <p>But not long after they made a move, the three Eternal Realm Hunters stood together with Luo Zheng and his companions, which was confusing.</p>

  <p>"It seems that your method did not work," Claire said and glanced at Slade.</p>

  <p>Though the Element Spirit Civilization had repressed the Finale Way for so many years, there were still many warriors at the Eternal Realm who yearned for the Finale Way on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng rose to power, then the Eternal Realm warriors would probably all choose to follow him.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization did not want to see that.</p>

  <p>"If these Eternal Realm Hunters wanted to follow them to death, then let them be," Slade said in a very calm voice.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Les just laughed and said nothing.</p>

  <p>Along the way to the north, the Heavenly Eye Vine continuously traveled through the layer of soil.</p>

  <p>After it crossed a distance of about three thousand miles, they arrived at a range of bumpy hills.</p>

  <p>The hills were quite sturdy and could bear the pressure of over one hundred thousand Jun. Even the Heavenly Eye Vine found it hard to travel through them, so it just crawled along the hills' terrain.</p>

  <p>"Quack, quack!"</p>

  <p>Just then, they heard a strange scream from the sky.</p>

  <p>It turned out that about eight peculiar birds lined up and spiraled downwards.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess released crimson shadows, which were like an octopus' tentacles as they lashed at the sky. Her shadows did not aim at anything, but they forced the strange birds to gather together. Then, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on the birds' bodies.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Then came an intense explosion in the air which struck the strange birds to death. However, there were no corpses, but only some bird feathers that slowly fluttered in the air.</p>

  <p>Fuxi blew on his fist and said impassively, "How dare these strange birds attack us?"</p>

  <p>As they headed north, he killed some non-human creatures who were surprisingly fast along the way. He showed quite formidable methods and skills and slaughtered those non-human creatures in no time.</p>

  <p>Pearson quietly sized Fuxi up. These human warriors in the Eternal Realm didn't seem to be as weak as he thought. At least, Fuxi was qualified to join the Eternal Realm Hunters if it was in the past.</p>
