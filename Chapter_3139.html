<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Staying in the Flow Tower for less than two hours would still be considered two hours spent.</p>

  <p>Warriors who entered the tower would seize every minute, maximizing every second.</p>

  <p>Even if they couldn't make it to the higher floors of the Flow Tower, they wouldn't leave within two hours. After all, one could only stay in the tower for twenty hours a year!</p>

  <p>As the crowd waited in silence, Trish appeared suddenly.</p>

  <p>She frowned as she searched the crowd for Luo Zheng. She knew he had done poorly, but she had to see the result herself.</p>

  <p>When she finally spotted Luo Zheng and Carrie, she headed towards them dejectedly. "I'm sorry, Mr. Luo. You've been rated as 'Poor'. I'm afraid you will be the last one to enter the tower."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged. They all turned towards the tower. Once the first batches of warriors entered, several golden dots lit up on the rough surface of the bricks and mortar that made up the tower walls.</p>

  <p>The golden dots seemed to hover on the first floor for a while, but soon they quickly climbed up to the second floor.</p>

  <p>"How fast they are!" cried someone from the crowd. "They are excellent,"</p>

  <p>Trish sighed, eyeing the golden light dots. "But unfortunately I don't have the luck to be their maid."</p>

  <p>The crowd eagerly watched as the golden dots moved along the walls of the tower. That way, they could follow the movements of the warriors inside.</p>

  <p>The first group of people were rated as 'Excellent'. They had been trained well, and they moved through the tower like a fish in water.</p>

  <p>The glamorous woman watched the moving dots of golden light with a satisfied look on her face.</p>

  <p>"The Flow Tower stopped working for two months. I'm pleased that this hasn't hindered anyone, as all the disciples have still made great progress," a person beside the glamorous woman said expressionlessly. "I wonder if anyone will reach the seventh floor."</p>

  <p>"Damien reached the sixth floor last time. If he makes it to the seventh floor this time, he will be qualified to move," another person said excitedly.</p>

  <p>Everyone hoped that someone would move into one of the independent courtyard houses. However, in the past year, no one in the Flow Sword Sect had gotten far enough to be qualified.</p>

  <p>The golden dots darted aggressively along the wall of the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, around eight dots had jumped to the third floor. A voice chirped from the crowd, "Such incredible speed!"</p>

  <p>Minutes later, ten dots stopped on the fifth floor.</p>

  <p>"The fifth floor of the Flow Tower is very crucial..."</p>

  <p>"Look! My master is summoning his power on this floor. Maybe he can reach the seventh floor in one go!"</p>

  <p>"Quit dreaming. We all know it's not that easy."</p>

  <p>The maids of the ten disciples fidgeted nervously, chattering amongst themselves anxiously.</p>

  <p>If their masters managed to make it to the seventh floor, they would definitely be treated better. In addition, their status would be promoted accordingly in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>It could be said that all the maids and their masters had shared weal and woe. Although they could not help much in the Flow Tower, they were able to help in all other aspects. The maids watched fervently, silently cheering their masters on.</p>

  <p>The ten golden light spots hovered on the fifth floor for another few minutes before they began to move again, albeit at a bit slower pace than before.</p>

  <p>While the maids couldn't see what was happening inside the tower wall, they could tell their masters were jumping inside.</p>

  <p>After a short while, a single light dot shot to the sixth floor.</p>

  <p>"It must be my master!" a girl dressed in white exclaimed in glee, her eyes sparkling.</p>

  <p>The other maids saw the light dot and muttered under their breaths, unable to conceal their jealousy.</p>

  <p>Damien Zhu was the best among all the disciples, and was most likely going to reach the seventh floor. Two months prior, he had come quite close, but in the end, he had left with deep regret.</p>

  <p>As for the other nine dots of golden light, the maids could tell their masters were still struggling on the fifth floor. From the looks of it, it was very difficult for them to reach the sixth floor.</p>

  <p>The clock was ticking. The maids exchanged nervous glances. Time was almost up.</p>

  <p>The girl in white grew more and more nervous, her ponytails bobbing anxiously. Success or failure hinged on her master. Just as she felt she were going to explode from the stress, the single golden dot suddenly rushed upward.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As expected, the golden light dot had really made it to the seventh floor!</p>

  <p>Normally, after a disciple reached a certain floor, they would have a rest there if they had enough time. After all, time in the Flow Tower was too precious.</p>

  <p>However, the disciple probably could not bear the pressure of the seventh floor. The moment he reached the seventh floor, he broke the door open and flew out.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Zhu! Mr. Zhu!" the girl with two ponytails shouted excitedly as she rushed towards the disciple. But she suddenly stopped halfway, disappointment and confusion written all over her face.</p>

  <p>Two other maids squealed excitedly, "Mr. Li! It's Mr. Li!" They chanted as they congratulated their master, Imran Li, who made it to the seventh floor.</p>

  <p>The girl with the ponytails struggled to keep her composure as her lips trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>At the last minute, three more dots of golden light made it to the sixth floor of the Flow Tower, one of whom was Damien.</p>

  <p>The sixth and seventh floors were quite different.</p>

  <p>Finally, two hours had passed. The three warriors, including Damien, opened the sixth floor door and emerged gloomily. The other six warriors emerged from the fifth floor, looking just as unhappy.</p>

  <p>These people had been training to reach the seventh floor. It was just such a pity that they couldn't reach it.</p>

  <p>After the ten warriors left the Flow Tower and headed towards their maids, the woman daintily announced the names of the next ten who were to enter the tower.</p>

  <p>The strength of the second group was obviously inferior to that of the first group. Their climbing speed was slower, and only one made it as far as the sixth floor. The others reached the fourth and fifth floors only.</p>

  <p>The other groups followed, with just as disappointing results.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around him, noticing the disciples who had finished their time in the tower were still there.</p>

  <p>"What are these people waiting for?" Luo Zheng asked Carrie curiously.</p>

  <p>Carrie turned to look at the people Luo Zheng was talking about. With a smile, she said in an amused tone, "They are waiting for you to enter the Flow Tower."</p>

  <p>"Me? Why?" Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>"Well, you are a new disciple, so it's very likely that you won't make it even to the second floor." She smiled mischievously, pausing for a dramatic effect. "That means you'll be expelled from the Flow Sword Sect. Then, they will try to snatch your nine entry tokens."</p>

  <p>The more entry tokens they obtained, the more times they could enter the Flow Tower. No one wanted to miss this opportunity!</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged as he realized that these people were just waiting for him to fail.</p>

  <p>Many more groups entered the Flow Tower, but the quality of the matches kept deteriorating.</p>

  <p>However, not a single one was trapped on the first floor. Even the new disciples, who had joined the Flow Sword Sect at the same time as Luo Zheng, had made it to the second floor. No one was expelled from the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>The disciples who had left the tower earlier threw dagger looks at no one in particular, as they were incredibly disappointed that no entry tokens were to be claimed. Everyone got up to prepare to leave.</p>

  <p>At this time, the glamorous woman cleared her throat. "There is one last warrior who has yet to enter the Flow Tower."</p>

  <p>Picking up the slip with Luo Zheng's name from the 'Poor' pot, she continued,</p>

  <p>"This disciple named  Luo Zheng Luo has been rated as 'Poor' for consecutive two months. This rarely happens. Now, it's his turn to enter the Flow Tower."</p>

  <p>Usually, ten disciples entered the Flow Tower at the same time as a group.</p>

  <p>But in this case, Luo Zheng was the last one left.</p>

  <p>Hearing what the coquettish woman said, the disappointed disciples instantly cheered up. There was no way this warrior would make it past the first floor!</p>
