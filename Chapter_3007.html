  <p>
</p>

  <p>Laura was the one in charge of the thirteen cultivation palaces, making her the immediate superior of each palace.</p>

  <p>She was only second to the three elders and the current leader of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>The leaders of other palaces showed their respect as they all bowed to her as a sign of courtesy.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Sword Legend Palace approached her with a small smile and asked, "How is your talk going, Master Laura?"</p>

  <p>Glancing at her indifferently, Laura coldly replied, "It's none of your business."</p>

  <p>"Well, do you really think that we have to fulfill the promise?" inquired the Burial Sword Palace leader, Dalton Yuebai.</p>

  <p>"Think about it. The Seven-Star Province respects us for our good reputation. It is our duty to fulfill our promise. But more importantly, what does this have to do with you?" Laura questioned back.</p>

  <p>Right after Caspian's disappearance, the Sword Light Palace swore that if his tomb was to be found, then a new leader would be selected.</p>

  <p>Over the past years, the tomb remained undiscovered and the current leader had been ruling the Sword Light Palace ever since.</p>

  <p>Nobody had expected that today, Laura could reclaim her father's tomb.</p>

  <p>Staying true to their promise, they should choose a new leader.</p>

  <p>As of the moment, the Sword Light Palace was divided into two groups.</p>

  <p>Even the three elders could not get along with each other.</p>

  <p>Two of the three elders were on the current leader's side so they did not agree with the reelection. Because of this, the whole Sword Light Palace was at a dispute.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Laura was understandably not in a good mood at all.</p>

  <p>After rebutting the two leaders, she glanced at the platform where the Sword Dance Palace was located, showing a touch of concern in her face.</p>

  <p>Smiling, Dalton asked, "You came here today to see the new disciples of the Sword Dance Palace, yes?"</p>

  <p>Before she could say anything, the leader of the Demon Sword Palace interrupted and spoke, "They are nothing but ordinary divine citizens from the Gracious Province. Why do you even care about them? They have such mediocre talent and weak foundation! Recruiting them is a waste of resources."</p>

  <p>"The Sword Dance Palace has long been a place for good-for-nothings and rascals of the streets. It's not a big deal to have more like them," Dalton insulted.</p>

  <p>Ingram heard this and could not help but give Dalton a grin.</p>

  <p>Dalton saw Ingram's little grin. Having a serious look on his face, he suddenly asked, "Ingram, is there anything wrong with what I said?"</p>

  <p>Raising his eyebrows, Ingram smiled and replied, "The Demon Sword Palace and the Burial Sword Palace have gotten the most resources, but you have only trained a few good disciples. In the past two hundred years, almost all of the disciples who have been promoted to the Stinger Guards are good-for-nothings. Now, how dare you insult the Sword Dance Palace?"</p>

  <p>"Ingram!" Dalton's face darkened as he was offended.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm just telling the truth. During the past hundred years, has any of your disciples been sent to the Taiyi Heaven Palace? Has any of them been promoted to Taiyi Guards? No! But you still had the audacity to gloat!</p>

  <p>Shame on you!" Ingram continued taunting.</p>

  <p>"You, you..." Dalton's face turned red with anger after he heard Ingram's statement.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with me? Do you want to fight? Oh, come on. I'll show you.</p>

  <p>Let's fight if you want. You're incapable! That is why your disciples are nothing but garbage," Ingram remarked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>What Ingram said brought shame to the palace leaders, turning their faces pale out of humiliation.</p>

  <p>Long ago, Ingram was qualified to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Although he had lived in seclusion for so many years, they were still no match for him.</p>

  <p>The once gloomy Laura didn't feel so bad anymore as she finally gave a soft smile.</p>

  <p>The officiant beside her said, "Ingram, this is the place to observe the sword, so watch your mouth!"</p>

  <p>Touching his nose, Ingram snorted, "Meh. I just don't like them."</p>

  <p>"The competition is about the disciples' talent and cultivation, not the strength of palace leaders," said the officiant.</p>

  <p>"I guess you are right. We wholeheartedly cultivate talents for the Sword Light Palace, but this guy is criticizing us. How can we let that happen? We should speak up. He's vicious!" Dalton said disdainfully, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Smiling, Ingram turned to the platform of the Sword Dance Palace to look at Luo Zheng, with an expectant look on his face. "You think that your disciples are talents? That's ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>All along, Ingram thought that Luo Zheng was just like him.</p>

  <p>He came with Laura all because he wanted to see Luo Zheng, not for any other business.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Dalton came to a realization and spoke, "So, did you find a talent in the small Gracious Province for your Sword Dance Palace this time?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he is a little more talented than me, if you ask," said Ingram with a faint smile on his proud face.</p>

  <p>The faces of the palace leaders and the officiant slightly hardened at his words.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace divided the talents of its disciples into eight grades, and those with sixth-grade talents could join the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Back then, Ingram's talent was classified as the sixth grade, and such a person was rare to be seen in the history of the Sword Light Palace. Knowing this, the palace leaders could hardly believe what he had just said.</p>

  <p>"So who is this man you are talking about?" Curious, Dalton asked.</p>

  <p>"Find him by yourselves."</p>

  <p>At his words, all the palace leaders focused their eyes on the platform of the Sword Dance Palace for they wanted to know if Ingram was bluffing. After all, people with sixth-grade talents were rarely seen.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng practiced the Truth of Cultivation Nature, he didn't resort to any external force, so he had met some difficulties along the way.</p>

  <p>Now when he was facing the Lofty Sword, he finally understood what Kenelm meant.</p>

  <p>It was true that he could double the result by exerting only half the effort.</p>

  <p>But this would only be possible with the Lofty Sword's help.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of the land of the ancient swordsmanship have been exploring ways of cultivation since ancient times..."</p>

  <p>After he read some words on the translation, an idea popped into his mind.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he felt that his consciousness was integrated into the sword-shaped pattern on the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>He felt that he himself turned into a sword! It was as if his soul had come out of his body.</p>

  <p>"Their eagerness to improve never ceases. It's the way to the prosperity of the world....."</p>

  <p>As he continued to recite the words, the Lofty Sword slowly gave off the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent that soaked his soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just started learning, so the knowledge of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was somewhat shallow.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he sensed that someone had actually led him to comprehend the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, making the whole process smooth.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, he had already recited five hundred words, and the sword-shaped pattern had grown larger and larger on the Lofty Sword. Now it was about half a foot long and was as thick as an arm.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the palace leaders' eyes were fixed on the platform of the Sword Dance Palace, waiting for something to happen. Finally, they found Luo Zheng's sword-shaped pattern.</p>

  <p>Surprised, Dalton stared at Luo Zheng and said, "He must be the person Ingram mentioned. It's quite an amazing feat that he can recite five to six hundred words despite that this is his first time learning the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. However, the Burial Sword Palace also has a lot of talents like him.</p>

  <p>Let's not make a big deal out of it."</p>
