  <p>
</p>

  <p>"There is more than one chaos," Zheng uttered in realization.</p>

  <p>This picture had just given him a piece of vital information.</p>

  <p>Within it, worlds were constantly rebuilt and destroyed and Zheng found it best to look at them carefully.</p>

  <p>Soon, he was able to find something wrong.</p>

  <p>Even with the constant cycle of rebirth, the internal energy of the worlds remained constant though Zheng felt the addition of new energy every time they died.</p>

  <p>For example, if a world was made up of ten units of energy, upon its death, it would create three more units of energy.</p>

  <p>Of course, it did not sound many on paper but when one thought about it, if every world was destroyed with 1/3 more energy, then wasn't it actually terrifying?</p>

  <p>As the world died, this added energy would burst out and then also quietly disappear.</p>

  <p>This observation made Zheng frown.</p>

  <p>"Where did this extra energy go?"</p>

  <p>Upon further investigation, he was able to discover something.</p>

  <p>At the moment of destruction, violent energy fluctuations would burst out and a spurt of strong energy would escape from the bottom as if sucked away by something.</p>

  <p>Zheng could only make a rough judgment since all he could base his assumptions on was this virtual picture.</p>

  <p>However, he had a good source he could ask. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, what do you think is the significance of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>Every existence in this world had a purpose.</p>

  <p>The chaos was no exception. It was obviously built to serve some kind of purpose.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the Instant Civilization built it to expand their influence?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven suggested. He had sensed that Zheng already had a conclusion so all he could offer was a baseless suggestion.</p>

  <p>"If they wanted to expand their influence, then they could've lived and multiplied within the chaos after they built it. The Element Spirit Civilization would've never risen in power and there wouldn't have been various kinds of ruling civilizations," Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>This theory of Zheng's had long since been put forwarded by other people but with differing opinions. Some claimed that the Instant Civilization sowed the seeds of civilizations and was so strong that they did not bother asking for anything to return.</p>

  <p>A few would say that the chaos was an unexpected world, which was probably why it was constantly rebuilt and destroyed over the ages. All sorts of assumptions were made and floated around as time went on.</p>

  <p>However, it was obvious that Zheng had just learned something different from the Ultimate Cycle so the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw it fit to hear what he had to say.</p>

  <p>"The Instant Civilization or the Four Spirits Sect probably built the chaos to absorb its energy. With this in mind, they had probably built more than one if they wanted to collect a huge amount," Zheng continued as he gazed at the picture in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't help but frown. "But the energy within the chaos should be constant and non-renewable. The total amount of chaos should remain the same from its conception until this very moment."</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "I disagree. The energy actually increases by a third when a new chaos is built and loses the same amount when it is destroyed.</p>

  <p>Only through this can balance be achieved."</p>

  <p>Zheng's statement made the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes tremble. He transmitted his words to the other heroes and one of them, the Snake Goddess to be exact, let out a laugh.</p>

  <p>A puzzled expression appeared on Zheng's face when he heard it. "Why are you laughing, Snake Goddess?"</p>

  <p>"Ask the Primeval Lord of Heaven," she replied.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed. "She's the most intelligent person in our human race and also extremely sensitive to energy."</p>

  <p>In the past, the Snake Goddess once invented a unique method of measuring the total energy in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The primitive land, the various worlds, the chaotic clouds, everything within the chaos was made up of materials and composed of energy.</p>

  <p>She used a unique method to calculate the total energy of the chaos and came upon the conclusion that it was constantly increasing.</p>

  <p>Her conjecture, however, was dismissed as mere, utter nonsense and many Eternal Realm masters laughed behind her back because of it.</p>

  <p>After each round of chaos was destroyed, the Sons of Truth survived in the new one and could directly observe the most original power of the chaos: the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy of each round was constant, which proved that the Snake Goddess was wrong.</p>

  <p>Since the Sons of Truth had a different conclusion, the Snake Goddess herself was confused. According to her measurements at the time, the energy would increase by 1/3 after the end of a chaotic era.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that some of the energy would be siphoned away when a round of chaos ended?</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven finished speaking, Zheng was suddenly filled with admiration for her. "You're truly intelligent, Snake Goddess. You were able to come to the same conclusion through measurement. I really admire you!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess snorted, "It was a pity that nobody believed me and chose to take the side of those stupid Sons of Truth!"</p>

  <p>To her, the Sons of Truth were just lucky to have been chosen by the chaos as the protectors of the next one but in truth, they were weak and only controlled a bit of truth-level theurgies.</p>

  <p>"It's all my fault. I'm sorry," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said helplessly.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess merely ignored him. "If this is the case, then the Instant Civilization wouldn't want to see the completion of the Finale Way."</p>

  <p>Once the chaos defeated that needle and completed the Finale Way, its constant cycle of destruction and rebirth would be no more. Extra energy would no longer circulate as the chaos would use it to expand outwards.</p>

  <p>"In other words, that needle was arranged by the Instant Civilization," she muttered in finality.</p>

  <p>Upon this conclusion, Zheng's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes flashed. The truth had given them clarity.</p>

  <p>The destroyer was also the creator.</p>

  <p>The chaos was constantly built, developed, and destroyed.</p>

  <p>This Ultimate Cycle was probably not some kind of theurgy but a method of education engraved in the bloodline that told the descendants of the Instant Civilization how to survive.</p>

  <p>"But this is only a conjecture," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess chose to remain silent. What he said was true. Though her words were reasonable, she had no concrete evidence to prove it.</p>

  <p>"There is a way to prove it," Zheng told them with a smile. "So long as we find a world like chaos in the Abstruse Energy World, then we will be able to prove it!"</p>
