  <p>"The second group!"</p>

  <p>The old man dressed in cotton clothes stretched out his hand and once again casually made a mark on the name list, in the end selecting two hundred warriors' names.</p>

  <p>As those names floated out, the warriors, who saw their names, entered the ancient palace.</p>

  <p>As for the challenges in the Illusion Space, the vast majority of the warriors were able to hold on for the first six rounds.</p>

  <p>After six rounds, the difficulty level increased dramatically. There were more and more warriors expiring then, and once they were vanquished, they would be eliminated from the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Seven rounds, eight rounds, nine rounds, ten rounds…</p>

  <p>As the difficulty increased, the number of eliminated warriors also increased.</p>

  <p>However, there were a few who were more powerful, and displayed eye-catching talents in the second group.</p>

  <p>For example, the warrior who was surnamed Li lasted for an amazing 19 rounds before he was finally eliminated!</p>

  <p>This time, the old man in cotton clothes was somewhat satisfied. He said in his customarily dry voice, "Among this group of warriors, Rafael Li has held on for nineteen rounds. Not bad!"</p>

  <p>A faint trace of a smile appeared on Rafael Li's impassive face. He then glanced at Zheng and Layla, hoping for a reaction on their part. A talent who could enter the thirteen palaces was, after all, quite conceited.</p>

  <p>Before participating in the Passing the Torch, Rafael Li had been very confident of his own strength. However, in the Enchanted Barrier Tower, he hadn't performed as well as Zheng and Layla had!</p>

  <p>Even though he had thought that it would be very difficult for him to get a first place, he had never expected that the gap between him and these two warriors would have become so large...</p>

  <p>The trial in the Illusion Space was not a competition of endurance, but a display of the strongest combat power one could wield with skill.</p>

  <p>However, Rafael didn't know how strong Zheng's and Layla's combat powers were. He was secretly concerned that they would be able to beat him in this leg of the contest too.</p>

  <p>But Rafael Li tried to sooth his worries by reasoning that Zheng was only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm, and Layla was just a woman after all… Rafael Li's mind was filled with distracting thoughts which came with an over inflated ego and distorted sense of self. Naturally, he did not want them to surpass him.</p>

  <p>"The third group!"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the names floating in the air, but he still couldn't find his own name.</p>

  <p>Layla was disappointed as she also didn't see her name. She took off one of her heart-shaped earrings and gently kneaded it in her palm. This time, she used too much strength and crushed it within her hand. Though, she hardly noticed, as the heart crumbled under her grip.</p>

  <p>However, the third group of warriors included Javier from the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>Javier had been severely injured in the Enchanted Barrier Tower. After the treatment he had received just now, he had managed to recover quite a lot.</p>

  <p>After the two hundred warriors entered the ancient palace, they quickly assumed their positions, projecting their figures into the Illusion Space...</p>

  <p>As they kept on battling, more and more warriors were eliminated, their projected selves disappearing after being vanquished...</p>

  <p>Among this group of warriors, Javier was the one with the best performance. If they were ranked according to the results of the Enchanted Barrier Tower, Javier would be ranked as one of the top three.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't as excellent or talented as Zheng and Layla, who stole the show, quite a few warriors still thought highly of him. He had impressed the other warriors with his skills and determination.</p>

  <p>But his result was shocking and disappointing this time. In the end, he was only able to hold out for a mere seventeen rounds! Not good enough to beat Rafael's score.</p>

  <p>Javier was the number one warrior in the Mist Palace, yet he had only lasted seventeen rounds, and his result was rather disappointing.</p>

  <p>When he left the ancient palace, Javier seemed a bit disheartened. Upon seeing his morose expression, Zheng could not help but shake his head in sympathy. Although Javier was persistent, he had bound his success to others and relied on everyone else's support to strengthen his conviction.</p>

  <p>In the end, he would fail to complete as many things as he could as his foundation was not solid.</p>

  <p>As for Yolande, she remained indifferent and showed no reaction to Javier's defeat.</p>

  <p>The fourth group...</p>

  <p>The fifth group...</p>

  <p>The sixth group...</p>

  <p>They waited for a long time, but Zheng's and Layla's names were still not selected or announced.</p>

  <p>As time passed, Zheng was becoming a bit confused. It seemed like the old man dressed in cotton clothes had done it on purpose, and wanted him to be in the last group. Layla would probably be arranged in the same group as him. The lengthy wait was starting to affect their nerves as Zheng and Layla waited for their chance to enter the ancient palace.</p>

  <p>Even though two hundred warriors entered the ancient palace each time, the warriors might still need to be divided into over twenty groups, as there were more than four thousand warriors. So Zheng had to wait for a long time before he took his turn in entering the ancient palace.</p>

  <p>Layla could also roughly guess what was going on, so she did not raise her head to look for her name.</p>

  <p>As more and more warriors entered the Illusion Space, some of them achieved amazing results.</p>

  <p>Some warriors might have only walked about eight thousand miles or even five thousand miles within the Enchanted Barrier Tower during the previous challenge. But, they had still managed to obtain good results this time. Testing different skills led to great accomplishments.</p>

  <p>After all, while the warriors had stayed in the Enchanted Barrier Tower, they had just faced the test of endurance and the comprehension of laws.</p>

  <p>Being a warrior was determined by more than just two skills.</p>

  <p>It was true that their fighting strength was linked to these things, but there were some warriors who simply weren't able to display their full strength in the Law Storm. In a different environment, these warriors were able to rise to the occasion and achieve greatness.</p>
