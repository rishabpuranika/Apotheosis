<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Did I really punch a hole through the floor of the Cloud Hall?" murmured Luo Zheng in surprise. A look of horror spread across his face.</p>

  <p>The power of the Exterminating Wheel had far exceeded his expectations. The raw power it produced shook him to the core. A ray of light shone through the tiny hole on the floor of the practice room.</p>

  <p>"All disciples in the practice room clear out!"</p>

  <p>Amidst the long wailing warning tune of the flute, Steward Xiao's voice boomed.</p>

  <p>Steward Xiao was one of the two stewards who handed out Cloud Hall Tokens to the disciples a few days ago. Upon hearing the summons, Luo Zheng reluctantly removed the Exterminating Wheel and took a deep breath before he started for the door and promptly walked out.</p>

  <p>Outside, he found several disciples of the Illuminating Soul Realm looking at Steward Xiao in states of confusion. It seemed that they all had no idea why the alarm was sounded out of nowhere, nor did they know why Steward Xiao called them out there while they were busy cultivating.</p>

  <p>"Who was it..." Steward Xiao asked in an expression of barely concealed anger.</p>

  <p>Before he could finish his question, Luo Zheng stepped forth and presented himself. "I apologize, Steward Xiao. I accidentally punched a hole through the floor in my practice room."</p>

  <p>The practice room on this floor was located at the lowest level of Cloud Hall, and not far below was a floating stone, surrounded by warning runes. No one had ever touched the floating stone before.</p>

  <p>All the practice rooms in Cloud Hall had myriad layers of protection. To use the practice room on this floor, one only needed to show the red Cloud Hall Token. So all those who practiced martial arts in this level were mostly new disciples of the Elite House. Given that the new disciples were relatively weak compared to the other batches, it was expected that they would cause little to no damage in the practice room, and so there were no strong shields on this floor.</p>

  <p>No one could have ever expected Zheng's Exterminating Wheel powered by the malicious Mu Ning could be so powerful as to punch a hole through the practice room shields and break the floating stone of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>If the culprit were anybody else, the stern steward would have punished him accordingly without hesitation. Unexpectedly, upon learning that it was Luo Zheng who broke the shield, Steward Xiao's face immediately relaxed and all fury dissipated from his expression. His mouth formed into a huge grin and he said, "Oh, it's you, Luo Zheng. It's not your fault. The shields of the practice room on this level are weak. If you want to keep training, you can make use of the upper floors. This kind of accident will be avoided for sure!"</p>

  <p>Once a purple Cloud Hall Token was obtained, this qualified Luo Zheng to use the best practice room in Cloud Hall, which could only be used by the elders. Those rooms were made with the mightiest pig iron, and could withstand even the full force of a cultivator at the early stage of Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Noticing the sudden change in Steward Xiao's mood, several other elite disciples were struck dumb for a moment and eventually sighed in unison upon realizing how fickle the steward was.</p>

  <p>However, they could not help but admire Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng, after all, had strong forces backing him, while they didn't have a single one.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was conversing with the steward, the vitality that resided in between heaven and earth became erratic and suddenly converged towards the direction of one of the practice rooms.</p>

  <p>Steward Xiao's face darkened yet again as he sensed the movement of vitality. Before he could speak, another explosion burst forth and the room that gathered the vitality blew to pieces. In the blink of an eye, a dark figure flew out of the practice room and stumped to the ground. The very next second, the figure slowly stood up and rubbed his forehead.</p>

  <p>It was Tianming...</p>

  <p>Steward Xiao's head immediately ached as he surveyed the scene. This batch of elite disciples seemed to be stronger than any other batch. Luo Zheng just punched a hole through the floating stone mere moments ago, and this guy apparently decimated the practice room.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head to shake off the grogginess. At the sight of the stern steward's face and Luo Zheng, he sheepishly muttered an apology, "I'm sorry for the ruckus I caused, Steward Xiao. I lost control of my strength for a moment while practicing."</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" snapped Steward Xiao. He was unkind to everyone except Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hua Tianming," Tianming answered plainly.</p>

  <p>"You will compensate for the destruction you have caused. Since you have just arrived at the Cloud Hall, and lack the necessary points, I'll record it first and then deduct the necessary points when you earn later!"</p>

  <p>Steward Xiao declared boldly.</p>

  <p>"Steward Xiao, Tianming and I are from the same sect. If you really want to charge him for the accident, you can just charge it to me," Luo Zheng interjected.</p>

  <p>"Charge it to you?" Steward Xiao froze for a moment and then his face relaxed and his tone became noticeably softer. "In that case, I'll have to let it go," he said with a faint laugh. "I must warn you, though, to avoid the destruction of the practice room from now on!"</p>

  <p>When Steward Xiao left, Tianming heaved a sigh of relief and turned to Luo Zheng with a mischievous smile. "Thanks, Luo Zheng! Man, what you said really had some effect!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at him straight with an inquisitive shine in his eyes and asked, "Did you just break through?"</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded in acknowledgement and chuckled, "I had a vague idea that I was going to break through on the Cloud Road, but what I didn't expect was that I didn't get into the Illuminating Soul Realm until now."</p>

  <p>There was a great barrier between the nature level and the Illuminating Soul Realm. Tianming had been in the consummation of nature level long enough, and in terms of talent, he might not be as outstanding as Luo Zheng, but he was not inferior to any of the other elite disciples in Cloud Hall. Thus, as his power had accumulated to a certain degree, he naturally made a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Luo Zheng, have you acquired the method of distilling Devil Phantom's essence?" Tianming eagerly inquired.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Tianming both gained a ton of Devil Phantom's essence along the Death Road. According to Tia, the said essence couldn't directly be used, since it was highly poisonous in its original state. Luo Zheng, though not afraid of any poison, wouldn't rush to consume it. It would be pointless to do so.</p>
