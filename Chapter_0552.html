<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The first eight ghost-faced spiders jumped up and rushed to Zheng. He could see their poisoned teeth with the black luster flashing. Apparently, there was rank poison hidden on them and if they bit him, he would be paralyzed or worst die instantly.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not afraid of the ghost-faced spiders' poisoned teeth. His body was a top-grade spiritual weapon and couldn't be invaded by any poison.</p>

  <p>He just thought that it was disgusting to be covered by such sick stuff.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Countless sword intent cyclones chopped the ghost-faced spiders.</p>

  <p>Clang...</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised to hear metal clanging when his sword intent chopped the ghost-faced spiders.</p>

  <p>"It is that hard?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's consummate sword intent was extremely sharp. However, it couldn't cut off the ghost-faced spiders' defense. It just chopped them away.</p>

  <p>The ghost-faced spiders that Zheng hit rolled several times on the ground but immediately climbed up in safety. As they opened their mouths, they created a buzzing sound and rushed to Zheng again.</p>

  <p>If Zheng would exert all his strength, he could kill these ghost-faced spiders. He assessed that the spider's defensive power was weaker than the mobula's. But killing the spiders one at a time would take so much of his time.</p>

  <p>So, Zheng just drove them away with the sword intent, and then he moved forward on the way the disciples from the Cloud Hall had explored.</p>

  <p>After escaping the ghost-faced spiders, Zheng was finally out of the jungle.</p>

  <p>He then found himself in a spacious valley where he saw the disciples from the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Cloud Hall disciples also encountered the spiders.</p>

  <p>In this spacious valley, there were countless dead spiders piled up. Not so far away from him, twelve disciples from the Cloud Hall were on position and arranged in an array.</p>

  <p>Cultivators could use life vitality and cultivation methods to perform some powerful arrays.</p>

  <p>The twelve Cloud Hall disciples combined their cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>Their array was learned from the Cloud Hall and had great power. The ghost-faced spiders came around in a group. The youth dressed in a white robe standing in the middle made the order: "Heptyl Metal Stab!"</p>

  <p>The six people on the left stretched their left hands simultaneously and pressed an acupoint on their own right hand. The life vitality of the six combined and a golden spear congealed on the ground. The golden spear stabbed the spiders in an instant.</p>

  <p>The youth in white ordered once more, "Snake Fire Burn!"</p>

  <p>The other six disciples summoned the life vitality and created a red fire that was powerful. It rushed to another group of spiders and burnt them to ashes instantly.</p>

  <p>The youth in the middle saw Zheng and the spiders following him. He wore a long face and said, "The Cloud Hall disciples are going through a pass.</p>

  <p>Why did they let somebody else in?"</p>

  <p>After the youth in white spoke, the other twelve disciples all stared at Zheng with their straight faces. Apparently, they didn't want others to enter this small island, so they dispatched two disciples to guard the entrance of the high platform. They didn't expect anyone would come in. What happened to the two disciples sent out to guard the entrance?</p>

  <p>The sword intent in Zheng's hand increased and formed a body-protecting shield to closely cover him. Those ghost-faced spiders attacked him but could do nothing to him as they were immediately driven away by his sword intent.</p>

  <p>Hearing what the youth in white said, Zheng stood there and sneered,</p>

  <p>"Does your family own the Cloud Road? Just because you're going through a pass, I can't come in? Hilarious!"</p>

  <p>The thirteen Cloud Hall disciples were stunned, and especially the youth in white. He wanted to warn this guy and just drive him away, but unexpectedly, this guy was a little arrogant.</p>

  <p>"Huh! You're digging your own grave!" the youth in white suddenly shouted, "Water Wind Kill!"</p>

  <p>The youth in white was ruthless and decisive. He wanted to hang Zheng using their great array without remorse.</p>

  <p>The great array of twelve disciples at the Illuminating Soul Realm had a terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Zheng could only kill one ghost-faced spider by one wave of his sword with all his strength. If he used the broken flying knife, he would kill them more quickly. But he could never be quicker than this great array.</p>

  <p>Any life vitality attack could kill many spiders.</p>

  <p>Seeing the grey wind pressure form and move towards him, Zheng changed his expression and moved backward immediately.</p>

  <p>Damn it, the youth in white from the Cloud Hall was ruthless and overbearing. He started a fight with someone he just met.</p>

  <p>A lot of people were overbearing, but they needed the strength. Facing the great array arranged by the Cloud Hall disciples, even Zheng could do nothing but run to the other side of the valley. He had to hide his strength for now.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape now? It's too late!" The youth in white sneered and waved his hand. The Water Wind Kill produced by the great array kept on following Zheng.</p>

  <p>This wind pressure was truly dreadful and almost destroyed everything on the way including the ghost-faced spiders.</p>

  <p>Because of his body of a top-grade spiritual weapon, Zheng could resist the wind pressure. If he got caught by it, he would probably be seriously injured. In the face of the Water Wind Kill, Zheng immediately raised his speed to the maximum level. For now, he had no choice but to change direction continuously and dodge rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Water Wind Kill under the control of the youth in white followed Zheng like a shadow.</p>

  <p>"Sword Step!"</p>

  <p>In a hurry, Zheng started the weird Sword Step and changed directions instantly. He turned left and right to dodge, appearing here and there.</p>

  <p>Then Zheng made a detour and arrived at the back of the valley, finally out of the sight of the disciples from the Cloud Hall. The Water Wind Kill eventually lost its target and dashed to the cliff of the valley aimlessly.</p>

  <p>With the power of this wind pressure, it could make a big hole on the cliff as Zheng thought. But surprisingly, something weird happened.</p>

  <p>When the wind pressure cut the cliff, a bright yellow light appeared on the surface of the cliff. The light covered the cliff, and no matter how the wind pressure cut it, it couldn't be broken.</p>

  <p>'What is this? There is an enchanted barrier on the surface of the cliff? Is this a part of the hidden test?'</p>

  <p>Everything on the Cloud Road was created and arranged by the powerful men many years ago. Since it was called the trial road, the hidden test must be mainly used for testing their skills. Zheng met those ghost-faced spiders as soon as he entered the small island, but he still didn't know what he was being tested for.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unclear, so he didn't go anywhere else randomly. The Cloud Hall disciples knew more about the Cloud Road than him, so they must have a purpose for killing the spiders in the valley. Zheng hid in a corner of the valley to secretly watch and observe those disciples.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the entrance of the arched door, Zheng was shown on the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>The power of the Water Wind Kill just now was too terrifying and Kenneth couldn't look. If Zheng was rolled in, his demise was certain.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng was quick.</p>

  <p>"Lennon is not easy to handle. Zheng is just making trouble for himself and he will surely suffer losses," Fernandez shook his head and expressed.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, Frank is more powerful than Lennon. Zheng ran away like a hare upon meeting Lennon. If he chanced upon Frank, he would have a worse end. Kenneth, you should teach your disciples at Could Sect to know their places. After all, they only have one life." Lady Long grinned as she saw Zheng being chased down by the Water Wind Kill.</p>

  <p>However, Fernandez shook his head and said, "There is no certainty here yet. Those Cloud Hall disciples on Could Road are certainly on the top.</p>

  <p>The Water Wind Kill is from the array of Twelve Earthly Branches arranged by Lennon and other twelve disciples, and it is difficult to resist even for the powerful men at the early stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, let alone Zheng. He has made the right decision to run away."</p>

  <p>Kenneth also seized the chance to retort Lady Long, "Master Fei is right.</p>

  <p>That's thirteen people versus Zheng. I don't think Zheng is weak as you said.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they can't arrange the Twelve Earthly Branches Array all the time. Zheng may have the upper hand on this after all!"</p>
