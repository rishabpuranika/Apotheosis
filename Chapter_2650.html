<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the butterflies had fully enveloped Luo Zheng, the strapping man looked away arrogantly.</p>

  <p>His name was Arvin and he was one of the Warden race's strongest warriors.</p>

  <p>The battle with the invaders was led by him, Bonnie and Bergen.</p>

  <p>The original plan had actually been slightly different. Berge and Bonnie would lead their clansmen to outflank the intruders from the left and right and cut off their retreat. Afterwards, Bonnie was to control the azure blue Trapping Butterflies to finish them off.</p>

  <p>However, just when the two sides started to fight, Luo Zheng had rushed up alone to stop Arvin, which interrupted their plan.</p>

  <p>After being sure that Luo Zheng was going to die, Arvin turned his thoughts to the situation ahead. He shouldn't have wasted his time on this young man.</p>

  <p>But just as he turned his eyes away, a green light flashed in the corner of his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Truth Crystal turned the sword green again.</p>

  <p>Facing the approaching butterflies, Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and gently shook the long sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The green sword tip touched a butterfly. With a crisp sound, the azure blue butterfly exploded and disappeared.</p>

  <p>After killing the first butterfly, Luo Zheng drew back his long sword and continued hitting the other butterflies, moving on to the next target as soon as he had killed one.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, all the butterflies that were charging at Luo Zheng were blown up by his sword.</p>

  <p>When the barrier of butterflies formed a crack, Luo Zheng rushed out, heading straight towards Arvin.</p>

  <p>"What the..."</p>

  <p>Arvin was stunned by the sight in front of him.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng's long sword had come straight towards his face.</p>

  <p>Arvin's reaction was equally fast.</p>

  <p>He swiftly took a few steps back, dodging the sword with lightning fast reflexes.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword still managed to graze him on the forehead, leaving a shallow wound that trickled blood.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Zheng was going to let go of this opportunity.</p>

  <p>Since he missed his target at the first try, he immediately thrust out his sword again.</p>

  <p>When Arvin looked at Luo Zheng's sword radiance, fear appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>This was a life and death situation. If he allowed himself to let his guard down, he could get killed by Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth and waved both of his hands. A string of butterflies flew out from his fingers, flashing blue light.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no choice but to use his sword to blow up these butterflies.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he had to slow down his speed in chasing after Arvin, which gave Arvin some breathing space.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, Luo Zheng was still in hot pursuit after Arvin.</p>

  <p>The two soon reached the middle of the street.</p>

  <p>It was the site where the people of the Warden race were fighting against the exiles and Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>"Pew!"</p>

  <p>A black light roared and pierced the leg of a member of the Warden race.</p>

  <p>The man in black robe rolled down the roof and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Go, go!"</p>

  <p>A few Wild Gods rushed forward.</p>

  <p>With a long halberd in his hand, the Wild God in the lead jumped up and nailed the falling man to the ground.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Wild Gods held all kinds of weapons in their hands and attacked the man mercilessly.</p>

  <p>In just a flash, the black robed man of the Warden race was dismembered into pieces.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the roof, just as three exiles jumped up and barely had time to stand firmly on their feet, three blue lights flashed in front of them.</p>

  <p>The three flying knives made from the azure blue energy all stabbed into their chests simultaneously.</p>

  <p>In the near distance, the eyes of a brown haired woman were cold, with azure blue flying knives in her hand fanned out neatly.</p>

  <p>"Shatter!" the woman said.</p>

  <p>The flying knives lodged in the three exiles' chests cracked into countless tiny pieces, spreading out from their chests.</p>

  <p>These pieces were said to be invincible. In an instant, they had seriously injured the internal organs of the three exiles.</p>

  <p>The cold-eyed woman was Bonnie Lou from the Warden race.</p>

  <p>She was heartbroken seeing the people of her race die one after another.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for her to accept such a tragic scene.</p>

  <p>The Warden race lived a peaceful life in this space and was in harmony with the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>The only battle in their history was a civil war between the free faction and the conservative faction, but it was nowhere as miserable as the battle currently raging in front of her eyes. After all, this battle was related to the life and death of the Warden race.</p>

  <p>Just as Bonnie was about to attack again, she suddenly heard a gust of wind.</p>

  <p>The look on her face changed immediately. She lowered her head and turned around.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!".</p>

  <p>A saber passed behind her. If her response had been a bit slower, she would have been trapped by the saber, and her body would probably have gotten split into two.</p>

  <p>After successfully avoiding the saber, she waved the blue flying knives out of her hand.</p>

  <p>Emily stood right behind Bonnie, her eyes deadly calm. She twisted her body slightly and tried to get through the gap between the flying knives to kill Bonnie.</p>

  <p>Emily had rich combat experience. Even if she lost her cultivation base, she could still use the conditions to her advantage. She wasn't going to give Bonnie a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>However, as the flying knives shot out, Bonnie opened her mouth and cried, "Shatter!"</p>

  <p>All the flying knives immediately broke into countless blue fragments, blocking Emily's path.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Bonnie quickly distanced herself from Emily.</p>

  <p>"You are Emily from the Snake Goddess race," Bonnie said, staring at Emily coldly.</p>

  <p>The people of the Warden race often disguised themselves when they came to inspect the bone towers, and they were quite familiar with the exiles. Bonnie had never thought that Emily would attack her in secret.</p>

  <p>"What a pity." Emily smiled faintly. The saber, which was stained with blood, spun slightly in her hand. She had just killed six black-robed people.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Bonnie raised her hand. The blue light continuously condensed and turned into tiny flying knives once again.</p>

  <p>Even though she had the grace of the Chaos Ancient God, she was still under great pressure to face Emily. However, it did not mean that she wasn't confident that she could kill Emily.</p>

  <p>Just as the two were in a stalemate and planning their next moves, a series of strange cracking sounds suddenly came from below and distracted them. They both looked towards the noises.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Emily saw that Luo Zheng was chasing after Arvin with a long sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>More oddly, the long sword in Luo Zheng's hand was glowing with a strange energy, which blasted through the butterflies easily.</p>

  <p>"Brother!"</p>

  <p>Bonnie's face grew pale with worry as she took in the scene.</p>

  <p>She had thought that Arvin could get rid of Luo Zheng quickly, and then come to her aid as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect that Luo Zheng would get this close to Arvin. She was now worried that her brother might be killed by him.</p>

  <p>Without a second thought, Bonnie turned around and threw several flying knives at Emily.</p>

  <p>Under the cover of the broken pieces of the flying knives, Bonnie jumped down from the roof and headed towards Arvin.</p>
