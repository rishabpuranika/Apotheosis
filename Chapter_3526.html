<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3526 Confused </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief sulked, the door of one of the training rooms suddenly opened. Looking up, they saw Feng Ge walk out with grace.</p>

  <p>Though Elvina was someone with special status, her room in the Land of Sword Grief was still in accordance with her ranking.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>"She came out!"</p>

  <p>"Did she manage to escape?"</p>

  <p>For the senior disciples on the first floor, Feng Ge was doomed the moment she agreed to face against the Ghost Scorpion. However, she could still escape since she wasn't obstructed by the Soul Binding Thread. She could definitely run away at such a critical time.</p>

  <p>Abdul stepped forward and respectfully cupped his hands. "Princess Feng Ge, how are things going in the Myriad Spirits City?"</p>

  <p>She gave him a cold glare. "Everything is fine. Zheng just asked me to inform you all that it's safe to go back to the stronghold now."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"We can go back?"</p>

  <p>"How is the Ghost Scorpion?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge retained her aloofness and refused to answer any of their questions.</p>

  <p>The only person she was really nice to was Zheng and that wasn't going to change anytime soon.</p>

  <p>With her message delivered, Feng Ge turned around and made her way back, making sure to slam the door in her wake.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>"Just what on earth happened in the Myriad Spirits City?"</p>

  <p>The disciples continued to hurl their questions at her despite her departure.</p>

  <p>No matter how loud they shouted though, Feng Ge did not answer them, preferring solitude in her training room.</p>

  <p>Now they were even more confused.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" someone asked. Another disciple shrugged in noncommittal reply.</p>

  <p>Could they really trust Feng Ge's words? What if it turned out that the situation in Myriad Spirits City hadn't been dealt with? Entering the Other Shore rashly could then lead to serious consequences. It would be like courting death!</p>

  <p>Chaim, however, had already been convinced. "Since Princess Feng Ge said it's been solved, then I guess we can go back now."</p>

  <p>Milo nodded in agreement. "I believe her too!"</p>

  <p>"Really? What if Zheng was captured and tied by the Ghost Scorpion who then threatened Feng Ge to lure us back to the Other Shore?" Abdul muttered in panic.</p>

  <p>It was a bit far-fetched but nobody refuted what he said.</p>

  <p>Everything was possible and it was their lives that were on the line here.</p>

  <p>"I can go back first and assess the situation for you guys if you want,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy offered.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes landed on her.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you!" Chaim said.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to be afraid of," Milo told them.</p>

  <p>Several warriors had a good relationship with Zheng and trusted him unconditionally. They believed that he would never let them walk into such a dangerous trap.</p>

  <p>Dorothy followed through with her offer, sitting down and leaning against the wall of the bronze palace. When she was about to enter the Other Shore, Abdul suddenly arrived to stop her. "Don't do it! Look, Dorothy, you're young and noble. I'm not going to let you take the risk."</p>

  <p>He exchanged a look with Chaim who only nodded.</p>

  <p>Both Dorothy and Feng Ge had special status. If anything bad happened to them, it would mean great trouble for the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>To Abdul, there was only one person who could enter the Other Shore and check the situation.</p>

  <p>That look was enough to tell Chaim all that Abdul wanted to say.</p>

  <p>"I'll go first then," Chaim said.</p>

  <p>Like Dorothy, Chaim made himself comfortable while sitting on the ground before activating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Chaim was once again back on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He made his way into the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold and found nothing.</p>

  <p>There was only a little bloodstain on the outside path.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>Just as he was racking his brains for an answer, someone asked, "You are the disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>When Chaim turned, he found a giant mouse standing not far away from him. On the back of the giant mouse sat a Soul of Light of an Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>Chaim recognized the Ear Mouse's Soul of Light immediately, having seen them in the Chaotic Source World before. "Yes. Do you know what happened here?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you come here alone? Where are the other disciples?" the Ear Mouse asked, not really answering his question.</p>

  <p>Zheng told the Ear Mouse that there were over one hundred new disciples it would have to bring to the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>Chaim felt a bit embarrassed to tell the Ear Mouse that nobody wanted to come to the Other Shore since they were scared, so he settled for a little white lie. "They'll be here soon. Let me just go back and get them."</p>

  <p>He left the Other Share with some urgency.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Abdul and the others kept staring at Chaim's body with bated breath, scared that he would suddenly drop dead at any moment.</p>

  <p>They all breathed a sigh of relief when he finally opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Chaim!" they exclaimed once he got back. "How was the situation?"</p>

  <p>Abdul asked.</p>

  <p>"It's alright. There was nothing except bloodstains on the ground."</p>

  <p>"What about Zheng and Princess Feng Ge?" Abdul continued.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyes flickered in fear. She wholeheartedly believed in Zheng but she couldn't help but be worried for him.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see them. There was an Ear Mouse waiting at the scene though and it told me to bring everyone back to the Other Shore," Chaim replied, narrating to everyone what he saw.</p>

  <p>His news was met with confusion. It didn't really tell them what happened in the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to go in if you're afraid. The new disciples can go with me to the Other Shore. I promise everything will be fine," Chaim assured everyone before entering the Other Shore once more.</p>

  <p>The aforementioned new disciples knew Zheng and had confidence in him They readily followed Chaim to the Other Shore, believing him wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>Abdul could only sigh in resignation. It was a risk but it seemed they were going to have to take it. He turned to the others. "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Judging from his tone, it was evident that he was ready to risk everything.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief followed, sitting cross-legged in order to enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>More and more Souls of Light appeared within the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold as everyone arrived.</p>

  <p>Abdul was the first to walk out the stronghold and saw the Ear Mouse Chaim had mentioned earlier.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse let out a squeak as it regarded the new arrivals. "It seems everyone has arrived safely. Please come with me!"</p>

  <p>Abdul's brows furrowed in confusion. "Come with you?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Where?" However, the Ear Mouse wasn't going to give him a straight answer.</p>

  <p>"You'll know when we get there."</p>

  <p>There wasn't anything abnormal in front of the stronghold but Abdul and the senior disciples couldn't help but remain uneasy with their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Then again, the moment Abdul decided to come back here, he had already decided to risk everything. Thus, he followed the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>If something bad burst out suddenly, then Abdul was ready to get out of the Other Shore and never venture into it ever again.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples followed Abdul's lead, walking out of the small path and heading towards the wide road.</p>

  <p>Unbeknown to them, the shocking news of what had taken place in the Myriad Spirits City already spread like wildfire.</p>

  <p>The matter about the Oneness Sky Palace was made known to the many races of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As the human Souls of Light traversed the road, they were not met with the usual scorn or contempt. Instead, the races of the Other Shore treated them with a hint of reverence.</p>
