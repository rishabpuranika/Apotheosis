  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The Civilization Artifact?" It was hard for Zheng to figure out exactly what the item was just based on its name. "What is it used for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. If I could just remember..."</p>

  <p>Elvinia continued to search her memories for information about the artifact.</p>

  <p>But as she thought about it, she felt something tear deep in her soul, as if a memory was about to break through. All of a sudden, she covered her head with both hands and squatted down. "Oww! It hurts..."</p>

  <p>"Clatter!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she released her hand, the Civilization Artifact fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I really can't remember. My head hurts!" Elvinia complained.</p>

  <p>Apparently, she couldn't think too much of this. Trying to dig too deeply into her memories was quite painful. Zheng stretched out his hand and gently rubbed her forehead. Then he asked her to take out dozens of soul pills and swallow them.</p>

  <p>Elvinia's physical body was different from Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was projected onto the Other Shore from the Source World, and the projected body seemed just like his real one. But only Elvinia's soul entered the Other Shore, and the body she inhabited here was like the armor. What form she would take after she left here, only the gods knew.</p>

  <p>But at least she could still absorb the soul pills. That was the silver lining.</p>

  <p>After taking the soul pills, Elvinia looked better. She didn't seem quite so pale, and she seemed more energetic. She pursed her lips and put her arms around her knees, unwilling to dredge up her memories again. She said, "I don't know what it is. Here you go! Take it if you want."</p>

  <p>Hearing her complaint, Zheng could only comfort her, "Alright. I'll study it and figure out what it is..."</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng bent down to pick up the Civilization Artifact and placed it in his palm, observing it closely.</p>

  <p>The item was extremely delicate. It was a diamond-like gem inlaid with over ten sharp thorns.</p>

  <p>Zheng touched the sharp thorns and twisted one of them as an experiment.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The thorns could twist!</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly shocked. This should have done something, and maybe he triggered some mechanism.</p>

  <p>'Okay, so maybe that isn't the right one. How about this one?'</p>

  <p>After thinking about this, Zheng began to twist the thorns one by one. He moved on to the next, and the one after that.</p>

  <p>"Click, click, click..."</p>

  <p>Every time a thorn was twisted, the Civilization Artifact would respond with a faint chime.</p>

  <p>The sound seemed to come from under the jade, but Zheng looked around and could not ascertain where it emanated from.</p>

  <p>When Zheng twisted the final sharp thorn, the ground began shaking under their feet. Zheng and Elvinia had to fight to keep their balance.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>The huge jade under the black pool started to shudder.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The black monkeys lurking in the dark and the other races also felt the quake, and they saw the black mud in the black pool constantly surging out and flowing in all directions.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Something is rising from the black pool!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>The black mud from the pool flowed away, and a huge jade stone was revealed. This stone was millions of feet wide.</p>

  <p>As the giant jade stone continued to rise, the ground around the black pool cracked. More jade was exposed, so Zheng and Elvinia also rose from the bottom of the pool.</p>

  <p>"That's... a huge city?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around, his eyes wide from shock.</p>

  <p>The originally flat surface of the jade ground began to change. Some parts of the ground started to sink, and the others started to bulge. The ground fell away to lay bare many roofs, turrets, towers, houses, and even bridges...</p>

  <p>Who would have guessed there was a huge city beneath the black pool, carved entirely out of jade!</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of creatures embedded within the Regal Jade City, such as the Regal Jade Bugs and the Regal Jade Beasts...</p>

  <p>In addition, there were pythons, unicorn cows, and other strange creatures with alien shapes.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not the only one who was shaken up by this. The creatures from the Dark Region hiding in every corner were flabbergasted when they laid eyes on the Regal Jade City.</p>

  <p>The calmest one among them might be Elvinia.</p>

  <p>She just thought that the green city looked incredibly beautiful. But she had no interest in what it might mean.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>More and more stairs appeared and spread from the surface of the giant stone to Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>The steps led to a jade tower close by.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Elvinia didn't respond. She figured that thinking had given her that splitting headache, so she decided not to do too much of that. She delightedly followed behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Elvinia ascended the jade staircase. Within a few seconds, they had reached the top of the tower.</p>

  <p>At the top of the tower, there was a square platform, on which floated a glowing speck. It was like a little pinprick of light. The speck danced around like a fairy, but it couldn't leave the square platform.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked to the side of the platform and stretched out his hand, trying to touch the thing. But his hand passed right through it. It seemed that it existed in a different dimension and could not touch Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>After the speck of light passed through Zheng's palm, it curled up in the corner of the square platform and convulsed continuously. It seemed to point to Zheng's left hand which held the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"Do you want this?" Zheng asked, pointing at the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>He didn't know whether the green speck of light understood his words or not, and it only continued dancing.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng placed the Civilization Artifact on the platform, the speck of light shot towards it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Soon after, a green light shot out from the Civilization Artifact and enveloped Zheng and Elvinia in its rays.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt the sky and earth spinning. The Regal Jade City disappeared and was replaced by a void. Brown clouds floated in that void.</p>

  <p>Elvinia walked into the void and asked nonchalantly, "Where are we?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had already deduced that the scenery of the void was the chaos. Just as he was about to answer Elvinia, a loud voice rang out from the void. "This is the chaos."</p>

  <p>Elvinia blinked and asked, "Then who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am the Regal Jade Spirit and the only member of the Regal Jade race who is still awake. The rest of them have slept for hundreds of millions of years," the clear voice answered.</p>

  <p>"Then where did the city go? Is it an illusion?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Following Elvinia's memories, they had taken great pains to obtain the Civilization Artifact. Surely it wasn't showing them only the pretty scenery, was it?</p>

  <p>"The Civilization Artifact has recorded the development of the 749th chaos.</p>

  <p>You can see the birth, the beginning, the growth and the destruction of the entire Regal Jade Civilization..." the voice answered.</p>

  <p>"The 749th chaos?" Zheng was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are the 749th civilization to rule the chaos." A trace of pride could be heard in that disembodied voice.</p>
