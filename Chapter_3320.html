  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The Civilization Artifact?" It was hard for Luo Zheng to figure out exactly what the item was just based on its name. "What is it used for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. If I could just remember..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge continued to search her memories for information about the artifact.</p>

  <p>But as she thought about it, she felt something tear deep in her soul, as if a memory was about to break through. All of a sudden, she covered her head with both hands and squatted down. "Oww! It hurts..."</p>

  <p>"Clatter!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she released her hand, the Civilization Artifact fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I really can't remember. My head hurts!" Feng Ge complained.</p>

  <p>Apparently, she couldn't think too much of this. Trying to dig too deeply into her memories was quite painful. Luo Zheng stretched out his hand and gently rubbed her forehead. Then he asked her to take out dozens of soul pills and swallow them.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's physical body was different from Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body was projected onto the Other Shore from the Source World, and the projected body seemed just like his real one. But only Feng Ge's soul entered the Other Shore, and the body she inhabited here was like the armor. What form she would take after she left here, only the gods knew.</p>

  <p>But at least she could still absorb the soul pills. That was the silver lining.</p>

  <p>After taking the soul pills, Feng Ge looked better. She didn't seem quite so pale, and she seemed more energetic. She pursed her lips and put her arms around her knees, unwilling to dredge up her memories again. She said, "I don't know what it is. Here you go! Take it if you want."</p>

  <p>Hearing her complaint, Luo Zheng could only comfort her, "Alright. I'll study it and figure out what it is..."</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng bent down to pick up the Civilization Artifact and placed it in his palm, observing it closely.</p>

  <p>The item was extremely delicate. It was a diamond-like gem inlaid with over ten sharp thorns.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng touched the sharp thorns and twisted one of them as an experiment.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The thorns could twist!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was slightly shocked. This should have done something, and maybe he triggered some mechanism.</p>

  <p>'Okay, so maybe that isn't the right one. How about this one?'</p>

  <p>After thinking about this, Luo Zheng began to twist the thorns one by one. He moved on to the next, and the one after that.</p>

  <p>"Click, click, click..."</p>

  <p>Every time a thorn was twisted, the Civilization Artifact would respond with a faint chime.</p>

  <p>The sound seemed to come from under the jade, but Luo Zheng looked around and could not ascertain where it emanated from.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng twisted the final sharp thorn, the ground began shaking under their feet. Luo Zheng and Feng Ge had to fight to keep their balance.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>The huge jade under the black pool started to shudder.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The black monkeys lurking in the dark and the other races also felt the quake, and they saw the black mud in the black pool constantly surging out and flowing in all directions.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Something is rising from the black pool!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>The black mud from the pool flowed away, and a huge jade stone was revealed. This stone was millions of feet wide.</p>

  <p>As the giant jade stone continued to rise, the ground around the black pool cracked. More jade was exposed, so Luo Zheng and Feng Ge also rose from the bottom of the pool.</p>

  <p>"That's... a huge city?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around, his eyes wide from shock.</p>

  <p>The originally flat surface of the jade ground began to change. Some parts of the ground started to sink, and the others started to bulge. The ground fell away to lay bare many roofs, turrets, towers, houses, and even bridges...</p>

  <p>Who would have guessed there was a huge city beneath the black pool, carved entirely out of jade!</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of creatures embedded within the Green Jade City, such as the Green Jade Bugs and the Green Jade Beasts...</p>

  <p>In addition, there were pythons, unicorn cows, and other strange creatures with alien shapes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not the only one who was shaken up by this. The creatures from the Dark Region hiding in every corner were flabbergasted when they laid eyes on the Green Jade City.</p>

  <p>The calmest one among them might be Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>She just thought that the green city looked incredibly beautiful. But she had no interest in what it might mean.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>More and more stairs appeared and spread from the surface of the giant stone to Luo Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>The steps led to a jade tower close by.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't respond. She figured that thinking had given her that splitting headache, so she decided not to do too much of that. She delightedly followed behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Feng Ge ascended the jade staircase. Within a few seconds, they had reached the top of the tower.</p>

  <p>At the top of the tower, there was a square platform, on which floated a glowing speck. It was like a little pinprick of light. The speck danced around like a fairy, but it couldn't leave the square platform.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked to the side of the platform and stretched out his hand, trying to touch the thing. But his hand passed right through it. It seemed that it existed in a different dimension and could not touch Luo Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>After the speck of light passed through Luo Zheng's palm, it curled up in the corner of the square platform and convulsed continuously. It seemed to point to Luo Zheng's left hand which held the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"Do you want this?" Luo Zheng asked, pointing at the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>He didn't know whether the green speck of light understood his words or not, and it only continued dancing.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng placed the Civilization Artifact on the platform, the speck of light shot towards it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Soon after, a green light shot out from the Civilization Artifact and enveloped Luo Zheng and Feng Ge in its rays.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt the sky and earth spinning. The Green Jade City disappeared and was replaced by a void. Brown clouds floated in that void.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge walked into the void and asked nonchalantly, "Where are we?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already deduced that the scenery of the void was the chaos. Just as he was about to answer Feng Ge, a loud voice rang out from the void. "This is the chaos."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked and asked, "Then who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am the Green Jade Spirit and the only member of the Green Jade race who is still awake. The rest of them have slept for hundreds of millions of years," the clear voice answered.</p>

  <p>"Then where did the city go? Is it an illusion?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Following Feng Ge's memories, they had taken great pains to obtain the Civilization Artifact. Surely it wasn't showing them only the pretty scenery, was it?</p>

  <p>"The Civilization Artifact has recorded the development of the 749th chaos.</p>

  <p>You can see the birth, the beginning, the growth and the destruction of the entire Green Jade Civilization..." the voice answered.</p>

  <p>"The 749th chaos?" Luo Zheng was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are the 749th civilization to rule the chaos." A trace of pride could be heard in that disembodied voice.</p>
