<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 886 The Negotiation Broke Down (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, the top-level war lords of the ogres who had just been quietly standing behind Maurice couldn't take the humiliation anymore. But the most infuriated one of them all was the second ranked ogre, Bradley.</p>

  <p>The immense rage he felt was written all over his face, and his majestic Mu Ning was spilling all over the place. He was prepared to make a move if need be.</p>

  <p>Aside from Bradley, the other top-level war lords were also heaving uncontrollably as they had their attention focused solely on Luo Zheng. They couldn't wait to get their hands on him and devour him completely.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing that his companions were already raring to make the first move, Maurice waved his hand to dissuade them from doing so. Then, he went on and said in a rather subdued voice, "You want us to step out of the Tower of Sin. That is something we couldn't possibly agree to. That is such an outrageous demand. You're asking for too much. Choose something more reasonable."</p>

  <p>"Too much?" Upon hearing such an audacious statement, Luo Zheng couldn't help himself from chuckling. "You wanted to have me killed. Wouldn't you say that was too much? If I were not strong enough to defend myself, I can say for certain that I would have died hundreds of times by now. I have no intention of killing every single one of your kind. I only want you out of this tower. I wouldn't really call that too much."</p>

  <p>Maurice was completely baffled by his crude remarks. Given that Luo Zheng had the nerve to say something like that, it would either be because he had so much faith in himself or because he was a stupid idiot who just wanted to run his mouth. It was clear that the latter had no chance of being true. From the way things looked, Luo Zheng was so confident that he could deal with the ogres with ease. To be able to make such a declaration, Luo Zheng must be so brave.</p>

  <p>"Since time immemorial, we ogres have never been afraid of any other race.</p>

  <p>Our top-level war lords have ceaselessly emerged in the Tower of Sin, and not once have we ogres ever lost our seats in the tower before. I can't comply with your demands. Choose something else to ask for." At this point, Maurice had been deeply amazed how he was being able to control his temper.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste time on him anymore. As I've told you a couple of times before, just kill him and everything will be over and done with!"</p>

  <p>Bradley, who had been standing behind Maurice, had enough of Zheng's rude behavior. His brawny physique flared and appeared in front of everyone watching. The cultivation of a top-level war lord burst forth like a tidal wave that was several hundred feet high rushing toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The second Bradley made a move, Esther responded in kind. A sheer net suddenly materialized before Luo Zheng to protect him.</p>

  <p>'The negotiation broke down!'</p>

  <p>That was the first thing that came to everyone's mind as they prepared themselves for the skirmish that was looming.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod seemed so out of it. They had been left so dumbfounded, as Luo Zheng had scared them out of their wits just now. Luo Zheng ended up ignoring their advice! As the old saying went, "even a rabbit may bite when cornered." The ogres were truly so prideful that there was no chance in hell they would agree with Zheng's demands.</p>

  <p>Among everyone present, only Maurice and Luo Zheng were firmly sitting still, peering straight into each other's eyes, as if they never noticed how Bradley and Esther had already begun making their moves.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that Bradley came darting toward Luo Zheng, he only got there halfway and couldn't even manage to get close to the net which Esther brought out, and an indistinct force instantly stopped him in his tracks.</p>

  <p>"Insolent human brat, when I tear you into a thousand pieces, you will surely regret opening your mouth!" Bradley frenziedly yelled.</p>

  <p>Furiously struggling, he tried so hard to break free from the imperceptible force which was keeping him bound. That being said, it ended up being such a futile attempt, making him look like a puny bug that helplessly got caught in a spider's web. The harder he tried to get away, the tighter the chain that seemed to be binding him became.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful war sages had no hopes of escaping this invisible force.</p>

  <p>Considering that Bradley was merely a top-level war lord, what could he possibly do to break free from its clutch?</p>

  <p>Without even bothering to give him so much as a single glance, Luo Zheng just casually blurted out, "Kill him."</p>

  <p>Poof!</p>

  <p>Just like that, the invisible force instantly ripped Bradley's body into bits and pieces. Brown blood splattered all around the hall. The scene of Bradley's death was utterly horrifying.</p>

  <p>Witnessing it firsthand caused all of the top-level war lords present to lean back in horror, taking in a deep breath.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just the top-level war lords of the ogres who felt horrified, even the top-level war lords of the Demon Night and the human race visibly had fear embedded onto their faces.</p>

  <p>The control Luo Zheng had over the Tower of Sin was far beyond what anybody could've expected it to be.</p>

  <p>The strength Bradley had been endowed with was ranked fourth out of the 128 seat owners. He was only second to Esther of the Demon Night, Maurice of the ogres, and another top-level war lord.</p>

  <p>Taking into consideration the fact that Luo Zheng was capable of borrowing the power of the Tower of Sin to easily lay waste to Bradley, then, it should go without saying that he also held the power to annihilate every single creature inside the tower.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, even Esther and Maurice themselves wouldn't be able to hold a candle to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mighty warriors wouldn't just jump at the jaws of death. In spite of being certain that Luo Zheng wouldn't lay a hand on her, Esther still looked so fretful, unsure of what could happen next.</p>

  <p>As for Fabian and Jarrod, their thoughts were all over the place. They had no idea how to explain what they were feeling after having witnessed all of that.</p>
