<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Feeling lost, Turner stayed silent and didn't dare to argue with War Emperor York. However, his son, Randy couldn't help but step up and speak for Luo Zheng, "War Emperor York, damages and injuries can't be avoided when warriors fight with each other in a battle. Why did you blame this on Tianxing?"</p>

  <p>Other warriors couldn't help but be surprised by Randy's statement. Even Luo Zheng was astonished too. The fact that Randy had the courage to step up and speak to War Emperor York was already a feat worthy of praise.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! How dare you scold me? Who do you think you are? If you dare to talk anymore, I'll immediately kill you!" War Emperor York was infuriated and he immediately shouted at Randy. He was too mad to choose what words would escape his mouth.</p>

  <p>Although Randy was highly regarded by Turner, he was just a prince who got a title in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. He was not even the crown prince. And now his father Turner had remained silent, it was not Randy's place to criticize War Emperor York. It seemed foolish to other powerful warriors what Randy did.</p>

  <p>However, when War Emperor York roared at Randy, Turner couldn't bear it any longer. After all, Randy was his son. Turner said coldly, "Lucien, what do you mean by that? How could you say that to my son in front of me?"</p>

  <p>"What do I mean? You try to guess. Humph!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York did not have the time to waste with Turner. All he wanted was to vent his anger on Luo Zheng. They were not worthy of his attention right now.</p>

  <p>However, at this time, Luo Zheng laughed wildly. "Haha, War Emperor York, you're the ruler of a divine kingdom and the emperor of the many martial artists, but it surprised me that you don't even know the rules! Hmm, why were you so mad if what I only did was defend myself? Just now, that little monster wanted to destroy my soul. If I don't counterattack, do you expect me to sit by and wait for him to destroy my soul just like that? That's absurd.</p>

  <p>If I haven't fought back, I might be the one whose soul got destroyed.</p>

  <p>How was that? That is truly the case of courting death! And in the end, my death would only be something you would think serves me right!</p>

  <p>Why don't we be frank here this time?</p>

  <p>Look at you. You are the dignified and respectable ruler of a divine kingdom but you are so mean to me. You lost the battle and disgraced yourself. You made a laughingstock of yourself!"</p>

  <p>The words that tumbled out from Zheng's mouth were loud and clear!</p>

  <p>Everyone around heard those words too, making them think of War Emperor York as a joke.</p>

  <p>When War Emperor York saw that Luo Zheng wasn't intimidated in the slightest by his Mu Ning and was instead reprimanding him in such an arrogant manner, he was so angry that he almost spat out a mouthful of blood! At the top of it, Luo Zheng even dared to scold an emperor like him.</p>

  <p>When had he, a dignified ruler of a divine kingdom been taught a lesson by a kid at the Virtual Tribulation Realm? Thinking of this made him sick in disgust. What was more, that guy had just defeated his people!</p>

  <p>How could he not get furious? He couldn't restrain himself anymore.</p>

  <p>What had happened to this world? For a moment, War Emperor York felt that the world seemed to have changed. And that was because of a young human warrior who dared to mess up with him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, many divine-level talents nodded their heads at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, they admired Zheng's courage. When facing the enraged War Emperor York, he was so calm and even dared to refute War Emperor York with clear points. On the other hand, they were worried for Luo Zheng because War Emperor York was a powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm. And the fact he was a war emperor meant that he was stronger than general powerful masters at Soul Sea Realm. Luo Zheng might face death any moment now because he infuriated the emperor.</p>

  <p>In front of many powerful warriors, Luo Zheng had thoroughly offended War Emperor York and provoked him into making a move. He probably wouldn't be able to escape death in the end.</p>

  <p>"Haha... Hahaha! Good, good, pretty good... I've lived for 8000 years, and an eight thousand-year-old man like me had to be educated by a twenty-year-old kid. Luo Zheng, you're really not bad, right? You're so brilliant and I really admire your kiddie courage." War Emperor York broke out into an angry laugh. He had now reached his limits. Then, he took a step forward, breaking into the enchanted barrier and arriving before Luo Zheng without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Their gazes met. Their eyes were full of blazing stare with fuming rage.</p>

  <p>No one could come between them.</p>

  <p>The mighty oppressing force from the soul of War Emperor York came as if hundreds of mountains were crashing down on Luo Zheng. It was too powerful that even the spectators were badly affected by that skill.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had been unafraid of his soul suppression. Now that Zheng's soul had fused with the will of the great world, there was not a single trace of fear on his face. That Mu Ning did not have any effect on Luo Zheng even a tiny bit. However, Luo Zheng was mad inside, so he wouldn't restrain himself and let the emperor be victorious.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood firmly and remained unaffected. But the divine-level talents below had to suffer. It was inevitable because War Emperor York's attack was too powerful to take for their levels.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York was furious and he only wanted to take Zheng's life, how would he care about the surroundings? He wouldn't waste time for these lowly creatures. Soul pressure gushed out like water. No one could stop him! He was venting his anger!</p>

  <p>As a result, the faces of the many divine-level talents all became deathly pale. Many of the weaker martial artists even fell to the ground, rolling their eyes and fainting on the spot. Zheng's attention diverted to them, but he didn't ignore War Emperor York's moves.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! Yes, you're right. Damages and injuries can't be avoided when warriors fight with each other. However, an eye for an eye. I will not be put upon. You, Luo Zheng, killed my son, and then the little monster. I have to settle accounts with you in the end! I have had enough of your arrogance!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York said coldly yet full of fiery anger.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was still calm. He didn't refute War Emperor York's claim about his identity. Whether he admitted it or not, War Emperor York didn't believe that he was Tianxing. Thus, Luo Zheng asked straightforwardly,</p>

  <p>"How do you want to settle the accounts? Tell me..."</p>

  <p>War Emperor York took a deep breath. The little monster was a trump card of War Emperor York. It was also because of this trump card that the York Divine Kingdom took a great advantage in the competitions within the four divine kingdoms. Now that the little monster was gone, his kingdom would suffer greatly.</p>

  <p>Firstly, the little monster could practice with the princes and help them cultivate faster. Secondly, once the little monster reached the Life and Death Realm, sooner or later he could help the mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. Everyone eagerly waited for the little monster to grow.</p>

  <p>But it went in vain all of a sudden because of Luo Zheng!</p>
