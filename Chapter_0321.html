<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 321 The Final Work Of Chase (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The last instance when some heavenly essence was sold via an auction in the Blessed Auction House, the elders from noble families of Imperial Capital regretted that they were not present there that particular day for a long time. Or else the price of the fifty drops of heavenly essence would have been far higher than the few hundred thousand cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>After asking for the price, Luo Zheng returned the 'Green Wave' sword to the shopkeeper and then in a following movement pointed towards the third one and asked, "Sir, could I know the name of the third sword?"</p>

  <p>The shopkeeper gently placed the sword 'Green Wave' back on the shelf.</p>

  <p>He then looked at the third sword as he shook his head and said, "As per what I know about the third sword, I strongly advice you not to buy it and choose some other sword."</p>

  <p>"Oh? may I know the reason?" Luo Zheng asked in an apparent tone of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well, I simply say so because the third sword is an unfinished one," the middle-aged shopkeeper responded in a soft hushed voice. "When Chase was forging this sword, he remained relentlessly awake for over two whole days. He began meditating after he took the refining fire back from the sword. And then he never woke up--Chase passed away in an upright sitting posture."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows and asked with curiosity, "Does this mean that Chase died from making this particular sword?"</p>

  <p>"You could probably say that, but it would not be completely true or even reasonable. Around the same time, Chase's natural lifespan too was coming to an end and he knew it very well. But for him, to make a fairy weapon was far more important and superior over one more year of mortality. It really is a pity that the sword remained unfinished even with the way he exerted himself for excellence one last time. It could have been a fairy weapon if Chase did not die. So now it is less valuable because it is a semi-finished sword!" The middle-aged shopkeeper bobbed his head slowly to express the sense of regret.</p>

  <p>"Since it is only an incomplete product, why would you place it here on the shelf with the other swords?" Luo Zheng asked. He went on with his second inquiry without a moment's pause, "Is there anyone who would buy a semi-product?"</p>

  <p>"Hey hey," the middle-aged shopkeeper laughed at Zheng's naive question and answered. "It is not ordinary either since it has the potential to become a fairy weapon with the right assistance. Being the final work of Chase, it is clearly worth something. I can show you its potential if you don't believe it..."</p>

  <p>While the middle-aged shopkeeper was speaking, he grabbed the third sword off the shelf.</p>

  <p>The next moment, he began comparing it with the other two swords Luo Zheng saw previously. The third one did not seem to share an on-par excellence.</p>

  <p>Its sheath appeared grey and there was no Mu Ning to be sensed at all. The first sword, Nine Edges Sword, was like a mighty warrior, which would immediately give people a sense of its intimidating power upon appearing.</p>

  <p>And the second sword, 'Green Wave', was like an agile killer with an ethereal vibe, which would arrive without coming into notice in an extremely swift and efficient manner.</p>

  <p>But the third sword appeared ordinary. It was like an airhead with a normal look, but without anything in his mind. The sword had lost its soul.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged shopkeeper then pulled the sword out of the sheath. It was almost finished. When Zheng's eyes focused on the edge, he raised his eyebrows without even realising it. The sword's edge was extraordinarily sharp. He could just sense the sharpness by looking at it. Except for the edge, all other parts, including the sword body, the handle and the sheath, seemed to be grey with grime.</p>

  <p>"This sword is nearly finished. Chase passed away before the last final procedure, which is the most important and crucial to make a weapon.</p>

  <p>And that is condensation," the shopkeeper spoke out. As he stroked the sword, he went on, "Condensation is to give the sword power with Heaven's derivative principle the weapon refiner learns so that the sword can have its own soul. And also because of this, weapon refiners can make all kinds of weapons, and the weapons can be thereupon divided into different levels. We put the unfinished sword here on display, just hoping that some fated weapon refiner would buy it and take it to its destiny!"</p>

  <p>"Condensing depends on the weapon refiner's understanding of Heaven's derivative. But each weapon refiner has his own understanding of Heaven's derivative and it is different from person to person. If an ordinary weapon refiner bought it, the result of condensing would probably be not good enough for the sword. So the sword may become only a mysterious weapon, isn't it?" Luo Zheng enthusiastically questioned again.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged shopkeeper agreed as he nodded, "Well, you're right.</p>

  <p>We only list the price ten thousand cubic crystals. If a weapon refiner has deep understanding of Heaven's derivative, the sword may turn to a fairy weapon. He can then sell it at the price of one million or several million cubic crystals. But over many years, several weapon refiners have seen the sword, but none of them can be sure to succeed!"</p>

  <p>"Condensation needs the weapon refiner's understanding of Heaven's derivative and he needs to condense it into the weapon. How about directly filling the sword with heavenly essence?" Luo Zheng blurted out yet another question.</p>

  <p>"Ha ha ha," the shopkeeper laughed loudly upon hearing Zheng's words and continued, "Heavenly essence is the essence of Heaven's derivative. Of course it will be better than the original method!"</p>

  <p>"Why don't they buy the sword and fill it with heavenly essence directly?" Luo Zheng was still puzzled.</p>

  <p>"That is a good question. First, heavenly essence is very expensive, and people usually can't buy it even they have many cubic crystals. Second, the sword is an unfinished weapon. Who knows how much heavenly essence it would need? It is a hit and missing process depending on skills and knowledge of the subject. Let's assume it is a fairy weapon. It can't become a fairy weapon without dozens or even hundreds of drops of heavenly essence. Moreover, a weapon refiner can strengthen a finished high-level spiritual weapon. It will be a better choice and it also will definitely guarantee a good result." The middle-aged shopkeeper replied confidently.</p>
