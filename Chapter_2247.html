  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been personally permitted by Joy to be a part of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>But after Mae brought him in, he hadn't talked with Joy much.</p>

  <p>It was as if she only viewed Luo Luo Zheng as an ordinary disciple who had entered her Hall, so she did not bother contacting him.</p>

  <p>In fact, those who were familiar with Joy were well aware that her restriction of only being able to recruit disciples in possession of the Purple Power Body meant that they were not as talented as the disciples of other Holy Beings. They were far weaker in strength and power and often left unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was someone who had been recommended by the Heavenly Han House. A talent like him would be regarded with interest and attention even if he were to enter the Holy Emperor City. But Joy turned a blind eye to Luo Luo Zheng as soon as he entered the Purple Soul Hall, which was rather unusual considering his potential.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng did not know was that Joy had been a silent spectator to his activities all this time.</p>

  <p>She had noticed Luo Luo Zheng from the moment he stepped into the Arena of Legends for the first time; how he had encouraged the people around him; to the time when he won all the battles in the Arena of Legends. Joy had kept a constant eye on him throughout his endeavors.</p>

  <p>Others might be unable to watch what was inside the Jade Wall of Legends, but this was not a problem for Joy. She had been a witness to almost all of Luo Zheng's battles.</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being, it was no doubt that Joy had a keen eye.</p>

  <p>She knew that Luo Luo Zheng did not possess the Purple Power Body, but he was capable of displaying the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao through a special magic weapon instead. As for what magic weapon it was, even Joy, who was in possession of a wide range of knowledge, had not yet realized.</p>

  <p>But what surprised Joy was Luo Zheng's actual strength.</p>

  <p>He had won more than thirty times in a row ever since he entered the Arena of Legends. He easily won in the face of the proving godly warriors. The chasm between him and his opponents was huge, and Joy could not wrap her head around the phenomenon. It was as if a low-rank True God had fought the proving godly warriors. The gap in strength could not be so easily overlooked.</p>

  <p>Joy was unaware of Luo Zheng's true hidden strength because the proving godly warriors were yet to test his limits. Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was almost dismissive in his behavior toward them. He seemed as if he did not even take them very seriously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words were indeed arrogant and even Pascal wouldn't dare say those words. But Joy showing up was a sign that the Demi-holy Being of Han Clan was on Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>"Master," Luo Luo Zheng said, bowing to Joy. He did not know much about Joy and had hardly expected her to turn up. Although Joy was no master of his, he still referred to her as such because of the unspoken manners and rules of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>"Come back with me," Joy said in response, a small smile playing on her lips.</p>

  <p>Her request was short, but Luo Luo Zheng was still moved.</p>

  <p>No wonder the female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall were so reluctant to leave. It was true that they did not want to give up the privilege of the Floating Island of Han Clan, but perhaps it was more likely that they did not want to leave their master.</p>

  <p>"Wait a second." Alfredo stepped in between, interrupting them.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he spoke, a wisp of purple smoke rose from the hall.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a flash of purple light flickered in Joy's eyes.</p>

  <p>The purple smoke spiraled up bit by bit. Forty-nine rays of purple smoke transformed into a divine array, out of which an obscure killing intent was unfurled. This killing intent was not heavy but effortlessly exuded terror.</p>

  <p>"Last time it was you who convinced the Holy Emperor to cause trouble for Purple Soul Hall, but I still endured it. You almost seem to forget who I am and the difference in our statures. Even if the Holy Emperor is present here, I have every right to bring my disciple back," Joy retorted scathingly.</p>

  <p>The faint killing intent quietly unrolled in Spiritual Heart Hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could feel the killing intent, but he did not know how terrible it was.</p>

  <p>He only knew of its power from the expressions of the top-rank True Gods, the consummate True Gods, and Alfredo.</p>

  <p>These True Gods who had looked as calm as water just a moment ago now turned as pale as paper. Their eyes betrayed the fear they felt.</p>

  <p>They knew that behind Joy's radiant smile was a blistering fury.</p>

  <p>The consequences of angering a Demi-holy Being would be unimaginable for the Han Clan members of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Alfredo, even as the master of the clan, turned stiff and wary. His voice seemed reluctant to come out of his throat. "Demi-holy Being, please don't be vexed. It's just that this boy has killed a direct descendant of the Xie Clan. If the Xie Clan insists on prosecuting him, I would find myself in a quandary."</p>

  <p>Joy had a clear understanding of what was going on even before she arrived. She smirked and the killing intent in the dark surged even more.</p>

  <p>The senior members of the Han Clan grew more nervous as it surrounded them.</p>

  <p>"So what? What was the direct descendant's cultivation base?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He was a low-rank True God, ranking in the top forty in the Arena of Legends," Alfredo replied honestly. Even though he was the master of the Han Clan, his voice cracked when speaking to her.</p>

  <p>He had offended Joy before. But because the Holy Emperor himself had made a decision last time, Joy had to swallow her anger and bite her tongue. Alfredo knew that she held a grudge against him already. If she unleashed herself on him this time, he would land himself in big trouble.</p>

  <p>"He was a low-rank True God and was killed by a proving godly warrior from my Purple Soul Hall. He was no better than a loser. You don't need to explain anything to them. If Xie Clan comes to you, you can tell them to come to me for answers," Joy said coldly.</p>

  <p>Alfredo was helpless. If Xie Clan went to argue with Han Clan, they would no doubt target him in the end. What Joy said was entirely unreasonable, but there was nothing he could do about it.</p>

  <p>Joy then looked Luo Luo Zheng up and down indifferently. She stretched out her soft and white hand and beckoned him closer. A streak of purple smoke rose and enveloped Luo Luo Zheng. "Let's go!" she uttered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately saw spirals in front of him and involuntarily took a circle. In the next moment, he had returned to the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>Once a warrior reached the consummation of True God Realm, they could teleport at will. For a Demi-holy Being like Joy, it was much faster to teleport.</p>

  <p>The center of the Purple Soul Hall was deathly quiet.</p>

  <p>Above the hall, six giant candles were arranged into position. The soft light cast six shadows in stark relief at different angles under Luo Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>Joy leaned against the broad chair placed at the head of the hall. Her pleated skirt shone in the candle light, outlining her defined curves.</p>

  <p>When she next spoke, her voice sounded indifferent. "Hurt the mid-rank True God at the fifth place, Langston Leng, and killed the low-rank True God at the fortieth place, Sheridan. You are much more powerful than I thought." She stared fixedly at Luo Luo Zheng before continuing, "Tell me, what secret are you harboring?"</p>

  <p>Being looked at by a Demi-holy Being like this, Luo Luo Zheng sensed a sharp chill rise up on his back, as if he were naked and her eyes were piercing through every inch of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's secret must never be let out to outsiders.</p>

  <p>Even Han Liusu and Aleyna couldn't be fully trusted, which was why Luo Luo Zheng had disguised himself and avoided them.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to tell his secret even when confronted by the Demi-holy Being, Joy. He was under great pressure when facing such a strong warrior. He cleared his throat unwillingly.</p>

  <p>"When I was a child, I received a great opportunity, so I cultivated from the level of an ordinary divine citizen..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was merely making something up when Joy waved her hand at him intently. An invisible force spread out and he found himself unable to continue.</p>

  <p>"You are quite powerful, and you also seem far too familiar with making up lies. You must have lied a lot, correct?" Joy's eyebrows curved up like a new moon as she stared at Luo Luo Zheng and clicked her tongue.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had been exposed straightaway, he remained calm.</p>

  <p>"Everyone has their secrets. If I end up revealing mine to others, it would be like losing my soul. I will not survive it. I hope you can understand."</p>

  <p>"Look at you... why are you so nervous? I didn't say that I won't understand." Joy smiled at his reply.</p>

  <p>If she truly wanted to fish out Luo Zheng's secret, it would not be difficult for her. However, as a Demi-holy Being, Joy tended to agree with Luo Luo Zheng. All had their secrets and hidden agendas. If one forced others to disclose them, it could have unnecessary and dangerous consequences.</p>

  <p>However, Joy had not asked for a secret. Joy continued, "If you want to keep your secret, you need to do something else in order to prove yourself."</p>

  <p>Joy would not offend Alfredo over a proving godly warrior for no reason. Since she had taken such pains to take Luo Luo Zheng away, she must have a purpose in mind.</p>

  <p>"What do I have to do?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, his gaze full of curiosity.</p>
