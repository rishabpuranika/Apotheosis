<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 375 Heaven-Fire Killing Array (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mack seemed unconcerned, but nothing escaped his attention. He deliberately pretended to curse and mock Luo Luo Zheng as he thought little of him.</p>

  <p>However, he tried to remember every small detail of every potential opponent in the arena.</p>

  <p>Mack used his unique methods to estimate everybody, including Hua Tianming from Skytop Peak, Vittoria Zhu from Lady Peak, and even Stark Xia from his own peak.</p>

  <p>Mack?had seen Luo Zheng's strength, his speed and his impenetrable defense.</p>

  <p>Despite of his feigned composure, Mack remained vigilant. Now that he was confronting Luo Luo Zheng, he chose to use his Star-Shifting Flag first.</p>

  <p>The Star-shifting Flag was considered to be one of the best spiritual weapons, not for the horrible damage that it could cause, but for the revolving magic array and the enchanted rune barrier inset on the flag.</p>

  <p>Anybody who dared to come close to the Star-shifting Flag would find himself spinning uncontrollably. The spinning wouldn't stop until the enchanted barrier was broken or the Star-shifting Flag was destroyed.</p>

  <p>However, shattering the Star-shifting Flag was extremely difficult.</p>

  <p>Even the warriors who reached the Illuminating Soul Realm found it challenging and time-consuming to break the enchanted rune barrier.</p>

  <p>But, none of those warriors was like Luo Luo Zheng. He hit the enchanted barrier with his fist, and it broke. It seemed impossible. But it was true! The? barrier couldn't be broken by regular strength. But, Luo Luo Zheng succeeded with brute force.</p>

  <p>Mack was confused.</p>

  <p>He?had no idea that the Emerald Crystal on Luo Zheng's left arm was the bane of the enchanted barrier. Even the barrier created by warriors who had already entered the late stages of the Illuminating Soul Realm could be easily restrained by the power of the Emerald Crystal. The enchanted barrier on the Star-shifting Flag couldn't endanger Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier was produced by inscribing runes on it. It would cost crystals to activate it. However, the Emerald Crystal could smash the barrier easily.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng applied the power of the Emerald Crystal to the barrier, it formed bloody lines on it just like a spider web. He punched it again, and the barrier shattered.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>A loud noise was heard as if a glass had been smashed to pieces. Then, Luo Luo Zheng wielded his fist and broke the flagpole.</p>

  <p>The?Star-shifting Flag was a spiritual weapon? even the flagpole was made of rare wood. It was tenacious and couldn't be easily damaged by a sword. However, Luo Luo Zheng was so strong that the flagpole broke into two pieces.</p>

  <p>"My flag..." Seeing this, Mack trembled.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Luo Zheng step over the broken flag and walk toward him, Mack realized that there was little time left.</p>

  <p>"How dare you break my flag? I'm gonna ruin you!" There was profound hatred in Mack's voice. Flames of fury were kindled in Mack's mind at the loss of his precious spiritual weapon. As a master of the magic array, Mack was often asked to set all sorts of magic arrays for the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>In return, he could earn cubic crystals or accumulate more points than other disciples. However, the destruction of one of his spiritual weapons was an irreparable loss.</p>

  <p>Mack stretched his hand, and an array flag appeared. He murmured to himself, "Great and honorable warriors, please arise and fight for your humble servant! Heaven-Fire killing array! Go and kill my enemy!"</p>

  <p>Nine array flags, with special killing spells inscribed on each, flew toward Luo Luo Zheng and surrounded him.</p>

  <p>It seemed that there was no escaping them!</p>

  <p>It was a magic killing array.</p>

  <p>Ordinary arrays could only produce illusions. Thus they imposed little threat to the people inside. The illusions were more likely to disturb people's minds, confuse them, and then trap them.</p>

  <p>However, the magic killing array was different. These illusions could kill people.</p>

  <p>What was worse, masters who produced the magic killing array, were good at hiding, being patient, biding their time, and finally striking a deadly blow.</p>

  <p>"Heaven-Fire killing array!"</p>

  <p>Although he was also a talented master of magic arrays, a saint from Cloud Sect was shocked.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, he found a disciple from Cloud Sect who was capable of setting the Heaven-Fire killing array.</p>

  <p>"I never thought that a disciple from the inner circle of Blackrock Peak would succeed in producing such a perfect and powerful Heaven-Fire killing array. Master Yu, you're well prepared, aren't you?" The saint smiled and said to Master Yu who came from Blackrock Peak.</p>

  <p>Master Yu was proud of the praise he received from a saint. "Saint Yang, please. You're embarrassing me. Although Mack did this, its power is nothing when compared to yours," he replied.</p>

  <p>Saint Yang shook his head and answered, "It's marvelous that a disciple who has consummated the nature level can set a Heaven-Fire killing array. With several years of practice, I believe that nobody in Cloud Sect will be able to beat him in the magic array. He's a real genius. I can give him that," said Saint Yang honestly.</p>

  <p>Saint Yang?could only succeed in setting the Heaven-Fire killing array after he had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm. In that regard, Mack was more talented than him.</p>

  <p>On the other side, the force of the Heaven-Fire killing array was terrifying.</p>

  <p>"The force of Heaven-Fire is stored in this killing array. I intended to use it when I battle with those personal disciples. However, I have to use it here and now, because you destroyed my Star-shifting Flag. Believe me, you'll regret your foolishness soon," laughed Mack wildly. He pulled out a magic array tablet from his robe and fiddled with it with his fingers.</p>

  <p>Then, lights of life vitality were connected with the array flags through the tablet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, surrounded by the Heaven-Fire killing array, felt as though the sky and the earth were spinning. Soon, he was engulfed by complete darkness.</p>

  <p>This killing array separated people inside from the outer world. The audience had no idea what was happening inside.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had witnessed the workings of a magic array many times. The illusions were created by the array flags to confuse an enemy.</p>

  <p>Cloud Sect's Bloody Mountain and all other mysterious places used by warriors to practice their martial arts, had been using magic arrays.</p>

  <p>However, none of those magic arrays were as good as the fairyland in the Immortal Mansion.</p>
