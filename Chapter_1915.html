<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Follow him! Don't let him escape from our field of vision."</p>

  <p>Kaydan and the rest were still in pursuit. Frustration colored their expression as they knew that they were no match for Zheng's captor. All they could do was follow Luo Zheng and his captor from afar. No one decided to get close and charge at the one-eyed man because they concluded that it would just mean instant death.</p>

  <p>The two ladies of the Han Clan led the warriors of the Han Clan as they also followed at the back of the group. With a confused tone, Han Liusu narrowed her eyes and said, "Aleyna, why do I feel like this person looks somewhat familiar?"</p>

  <p>Aleyna looked at Lauisha but she shook her head and replied, "I don't know this person…"</p>

  <p>"Kennan, what do you think? Do you recognize him?" Han Liusu asked again as she shifted her gaze towards Kennan.</p>

  <p>Kennan and other world lords shook their heads simultaneously. These world lords didn't have a high status in the Han Clan. In fact, if Han Liusu cultivated in the divine land, her guards would definitely be True Gods, and the world lords were not qualified to fulfill such a job. However, since there was no way for a True God to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Han Clan could only send world lords to act as her guards. With their low status in the house, these world lords even rarely had the chance to see the Holy Emperor, and it was less likely for them to see any of the top figures.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, I'm sorry but I don't know him." Kennan shook his head.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu frowned and thought for a moment before she spoke calmly,</p>

  <p>"Six years ago, after the great council meeting of the Hall of Holy Beings, they picked the sprouts of the Ray Trees. Father once invited all the Holy Beings to a banquet. I seem to have seen this person at the banquet…"</p>

  <p>"What!" The expressions of Kennan and other world lords changed drastically. They listened intently for more information about the abductor.</p>

  <p>To be able to be personally entertained by the Holy Emperor, the abductor must be a Holy Being. At the very least, he would be a top-rank True God that was only second to a Holy Being!</p>

  <p>It suddenly made sense why that person was very powerful…</p>

  <p>"If my memory serves me correctly, this person should be Holy Drew,"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu continued. Her voice was still calm but filled with caution.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Are you serious?!"</p>

  <p>Many of the world lords were shocked as they heard Liusu's revelation.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! Holy Drew is an extremely eccentric person. How could a person like him personally appear here in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land?"</p>

  <p>"Back then, even the Holy Emperor hasn't managed to ask his help…"</p>

  <p>"But the rumors have it that Holy Drew refined one of his eyes into a supreme chaotic weapon, also known as the Devil's Eye. The Holy Drew indeed has only one eye. He is the same as the abductor!"</p>

  <p>Even if the world lords might not have the qualifications to see these top-level warriors, it didn't mean that they hadn't heard of them. In fact, the legends of every Holy Being were widespread in the divine land. Their tales were known by warriors of different cultivation levels.</p>

  <p>Among these legendary tales, many referred to or included Holy Drew.</p>

  <p>The legend of Holy Drew said that he started only as an ordinary weapon refiner. Although he had a bit of fame in the divine land, his cultivation only made him a low-rank True God and could even be considered an insignificant one.</p>

  <p>At that time, weapon refiners only acknowledged orthodox methods.</p>

  <p>However, Holy Drew's temperament and personality were eccentric. Due to his unorthodox lifestyle and techniques, he was expelled from the weapon refining sect he belonged to.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew failed to achieve anything extraordinary in the path of a blacksmith in refining supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, weapon refiners were a popular profession no matter where they went. Some famous weapon refiners were much richer than martial artists of the same cultivation level. They could live a well-off life if they relied on their own skills.</p>

  <p>However, Holy Drew still held a grudge over his expulsion from his sect.</p>

  <p>His frustrations had built up because he hadn't made any big breakthroughs in the refinement of supreme primordial weapons. Then, he set his sights on the applications of chaotic energy!</p>

  <p>He knew there was chaotic energy at the edge of the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the chaotic energy was similar to a highly toxic poison for martial artists. Their cinnabar fields would be corrupted and wouldn't hold the energy. Then, Holy Drew came up with an idea: What would happen if chaotic energy was sealed into weapons?</p>

  <p>In fact, many weapon refiners already came up with the concept of a supreme chaotic weapon. However, none had tried yet to put the idea into action.</p>

  <p>After Holy Drew came up with his hypothesis, he embarked on a journey to test it out without any delay.</p>

  <p>As a low-rank True God, it was difficult to obtain chaotic energy. Only Holy Beings would be powerful enough to roam in the chaos. However, this did not mean that there was no chaotic energy available in the divine land.</p>

  <p>There was the Ray Wood in the east, the Sunrest Wood in the west, the Lofty Wood in the north, and the Hidden Wood in the south. The roots of these four divine trees were all buried at the edge of the divine land. The roots of these divine trees stretched for hundreds of millions of miles, reached the periphery of the divine land, deep into the chaos, and continuously absorbed the chaotic energy in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew had visited all the four divine trees before, and in the end, he had paid a considerable price. Despite the near depletion of all of his wealth, he finally obtained chaotic energy from the Hidden Wood in the south.</p>

  <p>The gathered chaotic energy was then being refined into the weapons according to Holy Drew's hypothesis.</p>

  <p>However, his first attempt ended up as a miserable failure.</p>
