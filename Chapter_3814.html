  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng was in a special form in the painting, it restrained many of his abilities. However, it was still his body.</p>

  <p>He was formerly immune to all poisons, but did that change when he was in this special form?</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure about that, but he had no time to think about it now.</p>

  <p>As the Chill Poisonous Leeches continued to come at him, he waved his arms in defense. "Egan, the Chill Poisonous Leeches have surrounded the human!" Kirk warned.</p>

  <p>"But we can't get back to him!" Egan said in frustration. The two of them continued to rush forward while the black eggs on both sides broke one after another.</p>

  <p>They couldn't stop since if they halted for even a second, the ever-increasing swarm of Chill Poisonous Leeches would swallow them.</p>

  <p>They already had enough problems with fighting off the Poisonous Leeches alone.</p>

  <p>If they got infected with the venom, they were doomed. It was clear that the Chill Poisonous Leeches would be one of their worst nightmares if they fell under siege.</p>

  <p>Normally, they were supposed to encounter only several Chill Poisonous Leeches in the place, but the current number of Chill Poisonous Leeches had reached half of the whole swarm already. They realized that it wasn't only the first page that changed, but the second page as well!</p>

  <p>In such a desperate situation, a moment of hesitation would naturally bring them to death. Besides, they weren't powerful enough to save Zheng anyway.</p>

  <p>They could only charge forward.</p>

  <p>With a heavy heart, Egan turned his head during escape and saw Zheng's figure had completely disappeared from his view. All he saw was a big ball of Poisonous Leeches, and Zheng was inside. He supposed that Zheng had died already.</p>

  <p>After the two members of the Three Eyes race ran for a certain distance, the ball of Poisonous Leeches suddenly moved. The worms continued to wriggle around it, then the ball slowly nudged forward.</p>

  <p>As the ball rolled along the path, it attracted more and more Poisonous Leeches to it.</p>

  <p>As a result, Zheng couldn't see his body, let alone Egan and Kirk.</p>

  <p>When he looked down from the top, he only saw an increasing amount of Poisonous Leeches that continued to pile on top of each other and crawl around him. Then, he felt something sticky around his body.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was still immune to poisons in the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>Even though the Poisonous Leeches repeatedly spat venom at him, he wasn't injured at all.</p>

  <p>However, the venom of the Chill Poisonous Leeches made his body feel numb and cold. It seemed that the venom contained immense freezing power. It wasn't a problem, though, since the numbness only lasted for an instant.</p>

  <p>But as he continued to nudge forward, more and more Chill Poisonous Leeches attached to the ball.</p>

  <p>Every time they spat out venom at him, he inevitably had to pause for a second.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he forcibly had to stop from time to time and moved at a very slow pace.</p>

  <p>Yet, the crooked passage was not long. Egan and Kirk in front of him managed to rush out before they got caught in the swarm of Poisonous Leeches.</p>

  <p>Both of them stood at the end of the passage and looked back, but they couldn't see what was happening behind them from their spot.</p>

  <p>"I don't think Zheng will survive that..." Kirk said after a while.</p>

  <p>"I know," Egan agreed and nodded.</p>

  <p>At the back of Egan's mind, he started to regret ever taking Zheng along this path. Not only did he fail to help Zheng, but he also led him to death. Guilt quickly overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," suggested Kirk.</p>

  <p>Many creatures had died in this journey in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and Zheng was just another of them.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore races that had lived in the Grand Plain Stage for a very long time understood that necessary sacrifices were inevitable. Egan and Kirk were fully aware that if they were not careful enough, they would die in the Eternal Scroll Painting as well.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how dangerous the Eternal Scroll Painting was, it didn't rob them of their desire to reach the Eternal Realm. No one wanted to give up entering the Eternal Scroll Painting because of fear. On the contrary, all the Other Shore creatures cherished such a rare opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait a bit more," said Egan with a frown.</p>

  <p>Although Egan and Zheng weren't very close, Zheng's amazing performances during their two encounters impressed Egan. Thus, Egan still hoped that Zheng wouldn't die that easily.</p>

  <p>Kirk sighed in resignation and stood beside him.</p>

  <p>They looked inside the depths of the passage until they saw a huge ball of Poisonous Leeches that rolled out of the corner. "The Poisonous Leeches..."</p>

  <p>Kirk muttered, his eyes wide with shock.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Egan asked. The scene took him aback as well. Before the two of them escaped, they witnessed the ball of Poisonous Leeches swallow Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the size of the ball of Poisonous Leeches now was far bigger than before.</p>

  <p>The mass of worms was tangled closely together, and the whole ball almost blocked the passageway.</p>

  <p>The huge ball nudged and stopped as it slowly moved towards the end of the passageway. "I-it's Zheng. He's still alive..." Egan slowly uttered in realization.</p>

  <p>"He survived so many Poisonous Leeches? And there are so many Chill Poisonous Leeches among them..." Kirk was also dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>They only knew of one possibility that could explain this: Zheng was immune to poisons.</p>

  <p>"Retreat! He's getting closer to us!" They suddenly snapped back to reality and hurriedly ran back.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not afraid of the Poisonous Leeches, but they were!</p>

  <p>While they retreated, Egan growled, "Zheng! Zheng! Can you hear me?"</p>

  <p>Everyone who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting still retained their senses.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng could still hear Egan even though layers of Poisonous Leeches enveloped him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied calmly. "Are you still alive?" Egan asked again.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the stupid question rendered Zheng speechless. But then, he asked back, "Is there any way to get rid of these Poisonous Leeches?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had tried to crush and kill the Poisonous Leeches.</p>

  <p>However, they were so slippery that he only managed to kill a few of them after a long time.</p>

  <p>There were probably thousands of Poisonous Leeches wrapped around his body, and God knew how long it would take to kill them one by one.</p>

  <p>Egan slowly stepped back to distance himself from the cluster of Poisonous Leeches. Then he said, "Yes, there is. Keep moving forward and then turn left at the corner. You will enter a room with a hexagram array. Once you enter the array, you'll be able to deal with them!"</p>

  <p>That was the purpose of the hexagram arrays scattered around the No-break Maze. Those who stepped onto the arrays would turn from a part of the painting back into living creatures, then they would be able to fight the monsters.</p>

  <p>However, this was probably the first time that someone had attracted so many Poisonous Leeches.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng followed Egan's instructions and continued to move slowly.</p>

  <p>After he turned around the corner, he indeed saw a separate room on the side. In the center of the room was a hexagram array.</p>

  <p>He dragged the Poisonous Leeches hard and moved towards the array. The second he stepped on it, his whole form underwent a drastic change.</p>

  <p>He regained his original appearance as a creature, and so did the Poisonous Leeches.</p>

  <p>When the Poisonous Leeches were just a painting, they didn't look that disgusting. Now that they turned into real creatures, however, Zheng instantly felt sick in the stomach at the sight of them.</p>

  <p>"Oh fuck! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>He felt miserable at the thought of how long the disgusting creatures stuck to him. His body trembled in rage, and he released a tremendous amount of power.</p>

  <p>The great force sent the thousands of Poisonous Leeches wrapped around him flying in all directions. Then, his power formed numerous spirals that spread everywhere, and the Poisonous Leeches were sliced into pieces before they fell on the ground.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Egan and Kirk, who stood outside the room, watched in utter surprise.</p>

  <p>The path the Three Eyes race had chosen might seem easier than the others, but it was also full of dangers. A large number of the members of the Three Eyes race had died in the hands of the Poisonous Leeches. This time, though, it looked like the Poisonous Leeches had found their nemesis.</p>
