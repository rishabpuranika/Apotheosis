<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4109 I'm Human </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'It seems that the higher I climb up, the stronger the Other Shore Tokens are at the other end of the light, ' Luo Nian thought.</p>

  <p>Then again, he had long confirmed such a theory.</p>

  <p>However, a distinct boundary between the steps formed by the pages did not previously exist. He only knew that the Other Shore Tokens were always better in the next page.</p>

  <p>Now that there was a distinct boundary, his interest naturally increased a lot.</p>

  <p>He squatted on the side of the page and pointed towards the red light.</p>

  <p>The moment he touched the red light, he saw a long, simple sword.</p>

  <p>A layer of white cloth wrapped around the hilt of the sword, and it appeared worn down.</p>

  <p>It also had a rough and dented blade with thin cracks.</p>

  <p>Despite the sword's flaws, surprisingly, it emitted great energy all the time!</p>

  <p>"Where is this sword located? It appears to be inside a tower?"</p>

  <p>Then, he moved his fingers back and forth along the red light so he could adjust the angle of sight.</p>

  <p>The inside of the tower was quite empty, but many Other Shore Tokens were neatly hung up on the wall.</p>

  <p>"Is this a cultivation tower of some civilization?"</p>

  <p>He had noticed before that there were some Other Shore Tokens placed with the other tokens in an orderly fashion.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, some civilizations and forces collected the Other Shore Tokens for their disciples to use.</p>

  <p>This tower was no exception.</p>

  <p>But compared to what he had observed before, there was more variety of Other Shore Tokens in this place.</p>

  <p>While he observed the tower, the old man at the top of the tower suddenly saw something strange. At that moment, he dashed and went inside the tower.</p>

  <p>Since he was connected to the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he could notice everything happening inside the tower as soon as it occurred.</p>

  <p>For instance, he sensed that someone was observing the situation inside the tower just now.</p>

  <p>The old man's movement also caught the attention of the young man in cyan robes. In the blink of an eye, the young man in cyan also rushed to the old man's side.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? Did anything happen?" the young man in cyan asked.</p>

  <p>The old man looked around and said in a grave voice, "Someone is observing the Mysterious Yellow Tower."</p>

  <p>The young man in cyan also followed the old man's gaze and smiled, "Did you have an illusion? Today is not the day to ring the bell. Why... "</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" the old man scolded sternly.</p>

  <p>The old man was usually quite amiable, while the young man was rather rude in front of him. However, the old man rarely scolded him in such a harsh tone.</p>

  <p>The young man knew that something was wrong, so he shut his mouth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the old man proceeded to go around the thirty-first and thirty-second floors of the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Finally, he stopped in the middle of the thirty-third floor and looked at the sword inside it.</p>

  <p>It was the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>It was an Other Shore Token with little information, so it was hard to evaluate its grade.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, no one knew who had used it.</p>

  <p>Neither did anyone know what kind of abilities it had.</p>

  <p>The only thing that was clear about it was that one could merge with it with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, no one knew how to use it after the merge.</p>

  <p>For example, the old man had fused with the sword with his unique talent, but he still could not use it. It seemed that it was just an ordinary sword.</p>

  <p>Still, the old man did not believe that it was.</p>

  <p>In the end, he placed the Lone Sword in the Mysterious Yellow Tower and waited for someone who could make use of it.</p>

  <p>After a while of silence, his voice filled the floor.</p>

  <p>"Here!" he said in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the mysterious observer just stared at the sword shamelessly without even bothering to hide his gaze.</p>

  <p>The young man in cyan robes looked at the Lone Sword for a while.</p>

  <p>He had also tried to use the weapon, but like the old man, he had failed.</p>

  <p>"Could it be that there is something in the sword? Maybe there is a soul trapped inside? Or even a Treacherous Being!"</p>

  <p>The young man in cyan robes carefully examined the sword and even sniffed it a little, but he did not sense anything strange.</p>

  <p>"No?" the old man muttered. "The mysterious presence came from the other side of the Other Shore Token!" he explained.</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes narrowed in doubt at the old man's words. "That seems odd?</p>

  <p>Are you sure?" he asked. "Yes!" said the old man.</p>

  <p>The young man was also shocked, "It..."</p>

  <p>Of course, he did not dare to doubt the old man.</p>

  <p>Besides, the old man would never talk nonsense about the matter.</p>

  <p>The old man stared at the Lone Sword for a while, while the eyes behind its blade continued to observe.</p>

  <p>"Hello? Can you hear me?" the old man asked.</p>

  <p>"Hello? Can you answer me if you heard me?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Where are you?"</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Nian, who stood on the step formed by the page, heard and saw everything.</p>

  <p>He even saw the nostrils of the young man in cyan robes quite clearly.</p>

  <p>The tower and its owner must have come from a powerful background, and he also wanted to communicate with him.</p>

  <p>The old man had sensed his gaze with his keen observation. It was already a miraculous thing because no one had ever noticed him before!</p>

  <p>Naturally, he wanted to answer the old man's question.</p>

  <p>The problem was that he could not do it at all.</p>

  <p>'How can I communicate with him?</p>

  <p>Do I use my consciousness?</p>

  <p>But the light is one way, and it is impossible to transmit sound!' he thought.</p>

  <p>He was now as anxious as ants on a hot pan.</p>

  <p>At that point, the young man in cyan robes in the Mysterious Yellow Tower rolled his eyes and said, "If you can hear us, you can stop staring for the time being!"</p>

  <p>"Stop staring? Yes, that is also a way of communication!" Luo Nian exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he did what the young man said, and his fingers left the red light.</p>

  <p>In turn, the old man noticed that the gaze behind the Lone Sword had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"He heard us," the old man said joyfully.</p>

  <p>Whoever was behind that gaze not only heard them but also understood their language!</p>

  <p>The young man in cyan robes was so smart. Since they could not communicate through such a one-way observation channel the light had formed, he quickly came up with an effective solution.</p>

  <p>"Since you can understand our language, you should be able to write in our language too. Remember, please do as I say. We write according to the sequence of letters," said the young man in cyan robes.</p>

  <p>"The first letter is A; the second letter is B; the third letter is C, so on and so forth.</p>

  <p>If you blink once, then that means the first letter; twice for the second letter; three times for the third letter and so on," he explained.</p>

  <p>All the words in the world consisted of letters.</p>

  <p>The person on the other side could not speak, but he could control his gaze, which made it possible for them to communicate.</p>

  <p>When the old man heard his disciple's idea, a faint smile graced his face.</p>

  <p>It was not unusual to spell words in letters to communicate, but his disciple had thought of it in a critical moment. Indeed, the young man was quite smart.</p>

  <p>"It's your turn, old man," the young man in cyan said and waved his hand.</p>

  <p>The old man asked the first question, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>On the other side, Luo Nian thought for a moment and gently moved his fingers on the red light.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he finished.</p>

  <p>The letters spelled "human".</p>

  <p>When the old man saw his answer, his face changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>"Old man, has he given an answer already? That quickly?" the young man in cyan robes asked. Even then, he still looked impatient.</p>

  <p>"Human," the old man said.</p>

  <p>"Human!" The young man in cyan robes thought of this word in his mind, and he was also surprised. "It is a human spirit!" he declared.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible. The human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits cannot return to the main world. It's impossible to go back. It can't be a human spirit!" The old man shook his head.</p>

  <p>On the opposite side, Luo Nian was also baffled.</p>

  <p>'What is the human spirit they are talking about?</p>

  <p>I'm human!'</p>

  <p>Thus, he began to fiddle with the red light with his fingers.</p>

  <p>He wanted to add the word "race."</p>

  <p>His fingers moved the red light according to the way they agreed on.</p>

  <p>Before he even finished, however, the old man already had the word in his mind.</p>
