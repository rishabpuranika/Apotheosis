<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2374 The Spear Of Time </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the edge of this space, a wide waterfall hung like a curtain of light on the cliff, splashing downwards.</p>

  <p>There was an emerald green jungle around it, forming a natural semicircle at the edge of the cliff. The whole scene looked pleasant.</p>

  <p>Zheng had found this place under Nelly's guidance.</p>

  <p>Some time ago, Nelly had borrowed a Royal Eagle from the Eagle race, and she had flown high in the sky and traveled many places.</p>

  <p>On the edge of this cliff, an ancient cypress tree stood tall and majestic.</p>

  <p>Nelly sat on the tree trunk, her snow-colored slender legs exposed now that she had taken off her shoes.</p>

  <p>She gently pushed her legs forward and immersed them into the waterfall. Her feet looked like they were coated with a layer of pearls as countless crystal clear water drops came in contact with them.</p>

  <p>She stared blankly at Zheng, who was sitting cross-legged on the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>For a moment, she thought that it probably was not a bad thing if they had to stay like this all the time.</p>

  <p>There was no dispute in this small world.</p>

  <p>The intrigues and conflicts among the powerful clans on the Floating Islands were beyond her reach here. She felt relaxed when she unloaded her self-defense.</p>

  <p>She hoped this moment could last forever.</p>

  <p>Once they left the world within the jade seal, they would have to face endless trouble.</p>

  <p>Zheng took out a piece of his soul and put it into the jade seal.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what was going through Nelly's mind.</p>

  <p>He needed to prepare for everything.</p>

  <p>Once he left the world within the jade seal, he would return to the Time Sea Forbidden Land. And once he left the Time Sea Forbidden Land, he would have to face a bunch of Holy Beings, some of whom were his enemies.</p>

  <p>And now that his identity had been revealed, he had to consider how he would escape from the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>He had previously been in a hurry to control the jade seal and did not have the time to explore it carefully.</p>

  <p>The gigantic bugs crawling on the light could devour three to nine seconds. It was indeed a special ability.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, it was not a very strong one.</p>

  <p>Currently, this ability could only prevent him from being harmed in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Under his full strength, the bugs could devour nine seconds. And in these nine seconds, all the damage he suffered would be ineffectual. This applied to others as well. They would not be harmed in these nine seconds too.</p>

  <p>If the top-rank True Gods or consummate True Gods kept attacking him for longer than nine seconds, they could kill him.</p>

  <p>In other words, even though he had torn three pages off the book of time, he would still be killed on the fourth page, and he couldn't escape death.</p>

  <p>The jade seal could control such a huge sea of bugs, so its effect should be more than that.</p>

  <p>Zheng closed his eyes and sank into meditation. His soul was exploring the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Zheng had put his soul into the jade seal, his soul had quickly spread out and connected with the bugs.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng tried to understand the inside of the jade seal.</p>

  <p>He soon found that there seemed to be a light film in the middle of the jade seal.</p>

  <p>'Charge over!'</p>

  <p>Urged by his thought, the wisp of his soul dashed towards the light film.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>However, after a series of collisions, this soul attack was easily blocked.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a while and then changed his tactics.</p>

  <p>His soul continuously intertwined and turned into a sharp awl, shooting towards the light film again.</p>

  <p>This time, the light film was instantly torn open with a resounding crack.</p>

  <p>Once he had opened this layer of light, Zheng found three bright dots of light on one side of the light film, each of which contained a special symbol.</p>

  <p>The jade seal was very small, and the symbols were even smaller, each as tiny as a dust particle.</p>

  <p>Zheng had obtained a new sense after infusing his soul into the light dots and absorbing them.</p>

  <p>'So the black spears are called the Spears of Time, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>A curtain of light suddenly appeared around the Heavenly Wheel Temple in the middle of the desert, revealing all the black spears on it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's thought went on, all the black spears stood up, their tips pointing upwards.</p>

  <p>The light curtain looked like a huge round hedgehog.</p>

  <p>Without the ability to track Zheng, Alfredo could only continue exploring the surroundings of the Heavenly Wheel Temple. But he was unable to enter the temple, no matter what he did.</p>

  <p>As he walked around the altar, he was startled at the sudden appearance of the light curtain and the behavior of the black spears.</p>

  <p>He had heard of the power of these black spears when he was in the Roc race.</p>

  <p>Unable to learn the language of the Roc race since he had been short on time, Alfredo had fretted and found the seriously wounded Troy.</p>

  <p>Among all the consummate True Gods, Troy's power was truly unfathomable. Even Rachelle was afraid of him. Alfredo hadn't expected Troy to be so seriously injured in this world and had been shocked.</p>

  <p>He saw that the skin and flesh in Troy's breast had already rotted. It appeared as if the wound had been corroded for years together and looked difficult to repair.</p>

  <p>He asked Troy about his wound and came to know that he had been injured by some powerful black spear.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't seen the black spears anywhere after arriving at the Heavenly Wheel Temple. That was because the Heavenly Wheel Snake had already left, and the light curtain was concealed.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected so many black spears to appear all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>The corners of Zheng's mouth curled and he turned his head once again.</p>

  <p>Then one of the black spears began to adjust its angle.</p>

  <p>Alfredo, on the other hand, was still a little puzzled. He frowned as his eyes wandered to the black spear.</p>

  <p>He barely had time to react as the black spear shot towards him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>"What the fuck!"</p>

  <p>Alfredo dodged the black spear, shocked, as it came flying towards him.</p>

  <p>The black spear almost clung to his body before flying away. A touch of dust was left on his brocade robe. When he got to his feet, his robe that was made of silk had turned into ash.</p>

  <p>The spear itself did not have much power.</p>

  <p>But once the spear touched the robe, time flowed at a faster pace and the robe was baptized for a number of years.</p>

  <p>The robe could not withstand the corrosion of countless years, which was why it was now rotten by time.</p>

  <p>The black spear finally hit a wall, leaving it covered in cracks and then turning into dust.</p>

  <p>Everything turned into dust due to the power of time.</p>

  <p>At this, a cold shiver ran down Alfredo's spine.</p>

  <p>In theory, the life span of a True God was unlimited.</p>

  <p>This was because their body would not become decadent with the passage of time. In other words, the metabolism of a True God's body was enough to offset the passage of time. All these factors combined to a balance, and a True God could live forever.</p>

  <p>However, anyone who experienced such fast speed for an endless time would not be able to withstand it.</p>

  <p>No wonder Troy was badly hurt after being hit by a black spear.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the power of the spear was limited in a small range. If it weren't for this, even Troy wouldn't have been able to endure it and would have already died.</p>

  <p>While Alfredo was deep in thought, another black spear rotated above the curtain of light and aimed at him.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?!"</p>

  <p>He then ran away from the desert.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the world, Zheng smiled smugly.</p>

  <p>It was not a difficult task for him to kill Alfredo, but it was meaningless.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he could only count on these consummate True Gods to leave the Time Sea.</p>
