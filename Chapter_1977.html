  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Pah, pah, pah!"</p>

  <p>Maha slapped the golden scimitar's side with his strong palm. Then, with a smile on his face, he said, "Supreme Lord Palmere's suggestion is truly great!"</p>

  <p>Even though Supreme Lord Palmere heard Maha's praise, he didn't seem happy at all. He remained neutral and didn't care about Maha's complimentary words.</p>

  <p>Decisiveness was one of Maha's characteristics. He casually patted his waist, and then a Roaring Token appeared and floated in front of him.</p>

  <p>After it was activated, Maha's voice loudly echoed throughout the entire universe...</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Luo Zheng travelled in the Breaking Cloud World along with Luo Nian and Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The three of them were focused on their plans when they became alerted by an unexpected sound.</p>

  <p>Maha's voice suddenly vibrated through the air, accompanied by his wild laughter. Luo Luo Zheng and the others could clearly hear his maniacal voice.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you talked nonsense a few days ago. Aren't you going to represent the human race to attack our Sacred race? Don't think that I have forgotten your idle threat! Now, on behalf of the Sacred race, I'll give you a fair chance. I will be waiting for you in the Sunflower Water World. I'll look forward to crushing you!"</p>

  <p>After he was reprimanded by Luo Luo Zheng, Maha did not make any move for several days. But with Supreme Lord Palmere's strategy, Maha's voice once again reverberated throughout the entire universe!</p>

  <p>"What?</p>

  <p>Maha dares to challenge Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Maha has the cultivation base of a world lord. Additionally, he also had once killed several grand world lords. That guy's strength is far greater than that of an ordinary world lord! When Luo Luo Zheng was in the Illusion Battlefield four years ago, he was only at the Spirit Supreme Realm...</p>

  <p>This challenge is unfair!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Luo Luo Zheng won't accept the challenge. He is at a total disadvantage!"</p>

  <p>"The Sunflower Water World is supreme world of the Thoughtless Minds. Maha is quite bold to choose that place. I wonder if Luo Luo Zheng dares to accept the challenge..."</p>

  <p>The discussions echoed throughout the universe. Everyone immediately noticed how disadvantageous the fight would be for Luo Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>As the discussions continued, the momentum of the entire universe would fluctuate. This momentum could neither be seen nor touched, but it really existed.</p>

  <p>With careful consideration, Maha's simple yet diabolical provocation was clearly a scheme. Any intelligent creature would immediately realize that the Sacred race just wanted to set up a trap. No wise warrior would take up the challenge!</p>

  <p>However, there would always be someone who wished for a true hero to emerge from the Evolutionary Universe. That hero was believed to unite the universe and defeat the Sacred race!</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng issued his war declaration through the Roaring Token some time ago, many creatures placed their hopes on him. A lot of them hoped that he would accept the challenge.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng tried to decline, he would inevitably leave the impression that he was someone who would talk but would not do what he said.</p>

  <p>Maha tossed the Roaring Token on the ground and continued to fiddle with the golden scimitar. A devious smile painted his face. He had already made his move. All that was left to do was to await Luo Zheng's response...</p>

  <p>However, Maha was startled when a child's voice echoed throughout the universe. He waited for Luo Zheng's response, and yet, a child suddenly spoke to him!</p>

  <p>"Maha, how old are you?"</p>

  <p>All the living creatures were stunned when they heard the child's voice.</p>

  <p>Bewilderment enveloped them as they couldn't figure out who or what the sound was from...</p>

  <p>As for Maha and the other Supreme Lords of the Sacred race, they were also stunned. They were confused about how a child's voice suddenly vibrated to their ears.</p>

  <p>Although it was strange, Maha was alert and did not reply with the Roaring Token. He decided to observe the situation first.</p>

  <p>"Maha, how old are you? You can't even tell me your own age? How can you be so boastful to issue such a challenge?! You're the number one Godly Genius of the Sacred race. However, it seems that you're too cowardly to even respond to my question..." The child's voice continued to mock and provoke Maha.</p>

  <p>The soft and young voice echoed in the universe and suddenly made countless martial artists and mortals laugh...</p>

  <p>"Where does the child come from? The kid has balls to provoke Maha like that!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha.</p>

  <p>Let's see how Maha will answer..."</p>

  <p>Maha was also extremely confused. Why was the situation completely different from what he had imagined? How come a child suddenly mocked him?</p>

  <p>"Tell me! How old are you?</p>

  <p>It's not a shameful thing to reveal your age. Why are you so hesitant?</p>

  <p>Answer me, Maha!"</p>

  <p>The child's voice continued to demand a reply from Maha.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Denzel, Supreme Lord Irvin and the others saw Maha's hesitant expression, all of them secretly laughed in their hearts.</p>

  <p>They thought of how hilarious it was that Maha couldn't even respond to a mere child.</p>

  <p>As for Supreme Lord Palmere, who came up with the suggestion, he had a strange expression on his face. Confusion enveloped his face as he wandered again in his thoughts. He had considered all sorts of scenarios, but he just hadn't expected that sort of thing...</p>

  <p>In the end, Maha slapped the golden scimitar onto the ground and activated a Roaring Token. His face reflected his agitation. "I am 92 years old!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence...</p>

  <p>Then, that child's voice said with a tone full of mockery, "You're so old!</p>

  <p>You are already a 92-year-old man! I am 11 years old, and my father is 33 years old. My father's age plus my age is only 44 years old. Even if you combined our ages, it would still be younger than you. It's simply unfair that you challenged my father to a battle. After all, if my father were to cultivate for fifty more years, he would easily beat you to the ground!"</p>
