<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Harold focused his gaze at Zheng, and asked, "Are all these strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm locked up in this prison?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and responded, "But soon, we broke the shackles of the prison so that they could leave."</p>

  <p>"They have left?" Hallet on the side couldn't stay calm as he asked, "Will they enter the divine land?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause for a few moments. Harold broke the silence and continued, "The key is the standpoint of these strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. "It was the masters at the Other Shore Realm who sent me back to the divine land this time. They are divided into many factions according to their respective origin. Among them, the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race are the most powerful."</p>

  <p>Hallet, Augustus and Joy had no idea what Zheng had just disclosed to them.</p>

  <p>They knew little about the Source World. Only Hallet had some knowledge about the existence of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Hearing the two race names from Zheng, they were quite unfamiliar with them.</p>

  <p>Just then, Harold suddenly stood up and stared at Zheng, his face full of incredulity. "The Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race? Do the people of the Nine Li race know your blood?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in response. "In order to join the Nine Li race, I had my blood tested in that world."</p>

  <p>"What was their attitude?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's words, Harold had now fixated his eyes full of excitement at him, breaking his usually composed self.</p>

  <p>Harold's reaction and expression had made Augustus' jaw drop. He had never seen him so excited before. He remembered that even when he took over the Swirl Forest, Harold still showed a calm appearance. This moment was a bit unexpected.</p>

  <p>"They helped me a lot," Zheng added.</p>

  <p>With a sudden sigh of relief, Harold asked with uncontrollable joy,</p>

  <p>"Where are they now? How many of them are there?"</p>

  <p>"Coupled with the members of the Snake Goddess race, I think there are thirteen of them. Originally, they planned to return to the divine land with me, but now there has been a problem. They are blocked outside the divine land, so they can't come in," Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>"They can't come in?" Harold was a little stunned. He didn't expect that the situation would be like this.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave a nod and continued, "Back then, Chiyou had spent a lot of effort in building up this divine land in order to protect his people. Even the top figures at the Other Shore Realm can't forcibly break it down, so they are blocked outside."</p>

  <p>Both Joy and Hallet listened closely and now understood what was going on. After Zheng came back from the bottom of the chaos, he had brought back many warriors at the Other Shore Realm. However, a sudden problem had occurred. They had been stopped outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>"But you and the other Holy Beings can return after you go out. How do you explain that?" Hallet asked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is because the other Holy Beings and I were born within the divine land that we can go in and out freely," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Joy couldn't help but knit her eyebrows as she asked, "Then how did the Yellow Emperor Guards get in?"</p>

  <p>Even though they didn't know much about the Source World, they knew that the biggest enemies were the Yellow Emperor Guards that were behind Nicholas. Logically speaking, the Yellow Emperor Guards were also outsiders.</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. The Yellow Emperor Guards should have also been blocked by the divine land and spent a lot of time before they were able to enter the divine land," Zheng clarified. "The warriors at the Other Shore Realm can enter, of course, but it will take them several years to build a space channel."</p>

  <p>"Several years..." Harold lowered his head and was lost in thought.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses had come out of the Evolutionary Universe one at a time and had done some changes around. Estelle returned and took charge of the Soul Wilderness, Augustus ruled the Swirl Forest, Tianming sneaked into the Dongfang Clan, and Zheng reached the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>For him, what the Godly Geniuses had done after coming out of the Evolutionary Universe was considered to be small things. They took place step by step as expected, but they still wouldn't have a special impact on the whole situation.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng suddenly brought back a group of masters at the Other Shore Realm, which directly reversed the situation.</p>

  <p>That was far beyond his own scheme.</p>

  <p>Now, the situation had suddenly become very advantageous on their side.</p>

  <p>This change had naturally taken him by surprise.</p>

  <p>"How many years will it take for them to enter the divine land?" Harold asked and stared back at Zheng. He had acutely realized that the time was crucial.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "They as well have no idea. It may be one year or five years."</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a commotion in the Goldenrain Hall of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Nicholas made a slap in rage. The surface of the chair behind him was immediately covered with countless tiny cracks.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>With a burst of the sound that made people's flesh creep, the chair was completely annihilated by Nicholas' power. It was wiped out completely, not even leaving any dust from it.</p>

  <p>"A bunch of shits! dozens of consummate True Gods from over ten powerful clans can't even catch a junior who has just reached the consummation of True God Realm! Shame on you!" Nicholas coldly snapped.</p>

  <p>The Goldenrain Hall fell into silence.</p>

  <p>As soon as the consummate True Gods returned to the Floating Islands, they were quickly summoned to the Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings such as Clark, Jeremiah and Murphy, who were located on the high platform of the Goldenrain Hall, pursed their lips in silence. They felt ashamed that their clans' consummate True Gods were lectured by Nicholas, but what he just said was right.</p>

  <p>Troy, Rachelle, Walton, Shahn and Lowell who just recently rose to fame were all the top figures among the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Other than them, the other consummate True Gods were also extraordinary in their strength.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had sent these people to search for a target. It was regarded that he attached great importance to the target. But he didn't expect that they would fail to accomplish the task. It was unfortunate that they returned unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the consummate True Gods, Troy was unable to remain silent. He took a step forward and raised his head as he said, "Zheng's strength has greatly increased. We are indeed not his match!"</p>

  <p>"No matter how strong he is, can he be stronger than all of you?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas mocked, showing a look of disappointment.</p>

  <p>Zheng was, of course, their very important target. If others knew about their failure, they would certainly be laughed at.</p>

  <p>The others would think that the so-called powerful clans were all completely jokes.</p>

  <p>"Holy Nicholas, with all due respect," Rachelle cupped her hands and respectfully intercepted, "if the space was not sealed, we might catch him. But since the space was sealed, we couldn't use the Grand Teleportation technique. Even the Demi-holy Beings couldn't be sure of success."</p>

  <p>"Rachelle! You don't have the right to speak!" Murphy right then scolded Rachelle. Of course, he didn't want her to bear Nicholas' anger.</p>

  <p>However, Rachelle was obstinate. She resolutely rebutted, "What I said is true!"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Nicholas had suppressed his anger. "It has only been ten years. Has Zheng really reached such a level?"</p>

  <p>Troy cupped his hands and said, "It is indeed out of our expectation. I don't know where he learned the skills. He turned into a giant that was tens of thousands of feet tall. I tried my best to unleash the Indestructible Metal Hand, but the power was actually less than half of his."</p>

  <p>Hearing Troy's experience of encounter with Zheng, the Holy Beings present showed surprise on their faces.</p>

  <p>They were very clear about his strength, and they had also met Zheng before. At that time, he was just a low-rank True God, inexperienced and still very young.</p>

  <p>It was really beyond their expectation. It was just ten years but they couldn't understand how Zheng had become so powerful.</p>
