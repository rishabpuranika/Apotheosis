<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 980 Flames Of Fury (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>On this Dreamy Swampland, everyone got their own schemes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wanted to take Mu Ning away and escape, while Eddie wanted to kill Luo Zheng and seize Mu Ning. Simon, on the other hand, wanted Mu Ning to die, and as for Luo Zheng, he didn't really care how he would end. If he died, Simon wouldn't benefit from it at all. All of Zheng's possessions would be taken by Eddie, so to him, it didn't matter if Luo Zheng died or not.</p>

  <p>With his current speed, Luo Zheng would be able to close out the ten-mile distance in an instant.</p>

  <p>And truly, soon enough, Luo Zheng was able to see a large cave below them.</p>

  <p>This cave was surrounded by moss and ferns. Because of the lush vegetation around it, there was almost no light that could come into the cave, and so all they could see was a dark hole, which was the entrance of the cave, and nothing else.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Zheng once again carried Mu Ning and entered the cave.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" When Eddie suddenly could not sense Zheng's life vitality, a puzzled look appeared on his face. Simon sneered in secret, but he pretended that he was surprised by Zheng's sudden disappearance. In no time, they reached above the cave.</p>

  <p>"This brat actually entered this underground palace!" Simon said in a feigned surprised tone.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Eddie's eyes narrowed. He turned to Simon in confusion and asked, "How did this kid know that there is an underground palace here?"</p>

  <p>Simon shook his head and replied, "This underground palace is very dangerous. I don't know how he knew about it - maybe he knew that he couldn't escape from you and so when he found out that there happened to be an underground palace here, he just entered it without much thought."</p>

  <p>After hearing what Simon had to say, Eddie gave him a suspicious glance. For so long, Luo Zheng had been going at one certain direction, but suddenly, he turned around and somehow knew of this underground palace, which he then entered. This didn't really sit well with Eddie.</p>

  <p>To be fair, he was a very skeptical man in the first place. Aside from doubting what Simon was telling him, he was also thinking whether Simon had told Luo Zheng about the underground palace in advance. As much as he wanted to confront Simon about it, he did not have any kind of evidence to prove his accusation. Moreover, it was unwise for him to argue with Simon right now, so he just nodded and said, "Even if he entered the underground palace, he won't be able to escape!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm caught up with them.</p>

  <p>Eddie glanced over and after a while he said, "Two are missing from the group. What happened to them?"</p>

  <p>Indeed, there were two people missing from the group of martial artists at Virtual Tribulation Realm. Upon being asked where the two were, one of them said, "One was killed by Luo Zheng, while the other one accidentally entered the lair of a water dragon and was devoured by it."</p>

  <p>The Dreamy Swampland was home to some extremely powerful and vicious beasts. As everyone went deeper and deeper into those beasts' territory, the beasts that they would encounter would only be stronger and fiercer than what they had seen before.</p>

  <p>"Water dragon?" Eddie said, showing a lot of interest. "I'll take care of that later," he muttered to himself, smiling maliciously. "But first, I'll go into the underground palace and take Zheng's life!"</p>

  <p>And with that proclamation, Eddie took the lead and entered the underground palace. Simon and the other Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Since there was no light in the underground palace, Luo Zheng had to constantly rely on his senses other than the sight in order to progress through it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this underground palace was built by some ancient sect. The road was meandering and spiraling, and it was like a huge maze.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew Simon was not the kind of person who would help him out of good will. But as he seemed to have no way to get rid of Eddie, he had no choice but to follow his advice.</p>

  <p>There were countless paths in this complicated underground palace, and almost every route had three or four diversions. Luo Zheng did not know whether there were dangers ahead, the only thing he could do was to brave it out and charge ahead. After all, the more diversions there were, the less possible it would be for Eddie to come and find him.</p>

  <p>Thinking about this, Zheng's face darkened, and his heart sank to the bottom of his stomach. He had gone through many hardships and was finally able to return from the Sea God Continent. But things didn't look good for him back here, and now he was being pursued by Eddie and his group who were determined to kill him. His morale was down.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Mu Ning started to pester him once again. "It's so dark here," she started, the disgust in her voice evident. "I don't like it."</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Xun did not taunt Mu Ning for her complain.</p>

  <p>Instead, in the darkness, she calmly stared at Mu Ning, scoffing at her peevishness in her heart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't say anything either and just kept traveling through the underground palace. He fled in any path he could take without really thinking about what could be ahead of him.</p>

  <p>"Could you find a way out? I don't want to stay here any longer!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning said once again.</p>

  <p>In her head, Xun couldn't help but sneer as she was already feeling Zheng's fury seething inside him. Xun was very observant and intelligent and so she knew whenever Luo Zheng was already extremely agitated. And at this moment, he really was. However, the idiotic young lady of the Xi Clan kept on nagging and was as irritating as a fly. If this continued, Luo Zheng would surely lose his patience sooner or later!</p>

  <p>'You know what? It would be best if Luo Zheng would end up killing this woman in a fit of rage, ' Xun brooded resentfully.</p>
