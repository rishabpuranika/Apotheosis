<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1695 The Top Five Warriors </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The arrogant and unreasonable girl who behaved all too willfully for her own good was now standing opposite Luo Zheng on the great stage of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Margaret's words, Luo Zheng smiled faintly. "Then tell me, what reward do you want?"</p>

  <p>Blinking her bright eyes, she continued walking toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Stepping on the Heaven Earth Board signified the beginning of the battle. It would be extremely dangerous for anyone else to approach the opponent at this moment.</p>

  <p>But she didn't seem to be worried that Luo Zheng would take the chance to attack her.</p>

  <p>When she arrived in front of Luo Zheng, she stood on tiptoe and smiled innocently. "Even if I could win this, I wouldn't take any actions against you."</p>

  <p>With that, she gave Luo Zheng a quick kiss on the cheek before turning around and returning to her own stone. "I admit defeat in this battle," she announced.</p>

  <p>The proclamation left the whole audience stunned.</p>

  <p>Not only did she take the initiative to admit defeat, but she also kissed her opponent.</p>

  <p>Many warriors were left puzzled by her behavior.</p>

  <p>The fight among these top ten warriors was linked to the future of the entire universe.</p>

  <p>If they weren't in the Illusion Battlefield, they would have fought to the death.</p>

  <p>Not many warriors were aware of the relationship between Luo Zheng and Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>When this painting was unfurled, Luo Zheng and Mu Ning had already been separated by stones, after all. Only a small number of ace talents had ever seen them snuggle up to each other.</p>

  <p>Many warriors looked forward to this battle on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>The sword array Mu Ning previously created had even forced Nathan to retreat. Many believed that she had great strength, more formidable than Shania, and they also believed she even had the strength to match up to Nathan.</p>

  <p>But other than the Purple River Sword Array, she hadn't displayed much of her real strength.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng could force her to perform her extremely powerful sword array during a battle, it would be an intense fight worth watching.</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, she briskly walked up to Luo Zheng and gave him a kiss before admitting defeat. Why on earth did she do it?</p>

  <p>"Haha! Mu Ning is truly bold.."</p>

  <p>"Such guts! She kissed Luo Zheng in front of all the warriors in the entire universe..."</p>

  <p>"But is it really alright for her to admit defeat just like that?"</p>

  <p>The group of women of the Apeiron Tower continued chattering about Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>These women spent most of their time in the Purple Power World and rarely went out. Seeing Mu Ning being so bold, everyone was riled up in excitement.</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron, their master, didn't care to give such remarks on Margaret's admission of defeat.</p>

  <p>The master was already satisfied that Mu Ning managed to make it into the top ten. The battles between the top ten warriors had something to do with destiny, after all. Whatever result Mu Ning could gain depended solely on herself� such was her destiny.</p>

  <p>Preston of the Pure Jade Sacred Place threw a secret glance at Ning Yudie. It seemed that Zheng's wife was in an angry fit, giving Preston a hint to remain silent. He sighed inwardly, confused about the younger ones' complicated relationships.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng returned to his own stone on the Heaven Earth Board, the proceeding battle began.</p>

  <p>This time, it was Kurt against Lawson.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had previously defeated Lawson in a single punch, the latter was still a Godly Genius second only to Nathan. His full strength was not something to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>This time, Lawson wanted to defeat his opponent to demonstrate his abilities and prove himself to others.</p>

  <p>Kurt's display wasn't bad by any means, but still, Lawson looked down upon him.</p>

  <p>Even all the members of the Lie Clan had hoped that Lawson could win a great victory.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the battle, Lawson gained an advantage over his opponent as he performed the Sky Breaking Slash. With this, he unleashed his own internal momentum at the same time.</p>

  <p>Still, it was alright for him not to display his own internal momentum.</p>

  <p>After Lawson used his internal momentum, Kurt successfully suppressed him until the latter was defeated.</p>

  <p>It left Lawson morose this time.</p>

  <p>Until then, Lawson had always regarded Nathan as his only enemy, always looking down upon the other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But now he had finally realized there was always someone better than him.</p>

  <p>Among the Godly Ways, he cultivated the Berserk Godly Way� the unusual one. It was difficult for others to resist his crazy attack. But when he faced Kurt who had fathomless internal momentum, the effect of this wild attack was limited.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of skill Lawson used, Kurt could break through it in an instant.</p>

  <p>One could say that Kurt hadn't taken the initiative to attack. Instead, Kurt waited for Lawson to make his move and used his theurgy to make a counterattack.</p>

  <p>Their battle was over shortly.</p>

  <p>This time, Kurt defeated Lawson, leaving the latter humiliated.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the patriarch of the Lie Clan didn't say a single word, silently calculating something.</p>

  <p>With the current level of combat power, a Godly Genius was close to nothing in the face of a major force.</p>

  <p>Even if Lawson were to go all out, he wouldn't be able to content against a Spirit Transformation Realm master. But these ten Godly Geniuses in the Illusion Battlefield represented the fates of all the major forces in the universe.</p>

  <p>In the universe, there was a kind of tree called the Enlightenment Tree� it could only be formed every one thousand years.</p>

  <p>If it was cut, it produced the Enlightenment Crysta, which was fragrant and a kind of healing panacea.</p>

  <p>To put it bluntly, after the Enlightenment Tree was cut, it produced the sense of crisis and secreted the Enlightenment Crystal as nourishment.</p>

  <p>If the universe was likened to the Enlightenment Tree, then those talents were equal to the Enlightenment Crystals. After the heavens sensed the crisis, the world of chaos was to be opened.</p>

  <p>Once the crisis arrived, the chosen talents would be sent to battle.</p>

  <p>The higher one's ranking was, the greater the responsibility one had to shoulder. The force backing him would also have a greater chance of passing through the crisis.</p>

  <p>If Lawson could make it to second place, when the crisis arrived, he could end up leading the Lie Clan to its survival. If his ranking wasn't high enough, he would probably find himself and the Lie Clan in danger.</p>

  <p>Every time a crisis came about, countless races were killed.</p>

  <p>The intense impact could bring about an ever-changing situation.</p>

  <p>Although the Thoughtless Minds was now extremely powerful, considered an old force in the universe, there could also be a chance that danger would follow the crisis.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the patriarch of the Lie Clan didn't worry about Lawson, but the Lie Clan itself.</p>

  <p>After the round-robin battles, the rankings were quickly determined.</p>

  <p>With that, Mu Ning, Lawson, Lucille, Karl, and Lone were all ranked low.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng, Nathan, Tianming, Shania, and Kurt were all ranked at the top.</p>

  <p>Perhaps due to bad luck, Lawson ranked low, having lost two battles because he was restrained and suppressed by his opponents. This time around, he was unable to fully display his strength.</p>

  <p>Lone was defeated because of his sword. Although it was a supreme chaotic weapon, it was still heavily damaged. If an opponent struck hard, the sword wouldn't protect the swordsman.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning, she often admitted defeat for little reason.</p>

  <p>Most of the universe's warriors guessed that she had the strength to match up to Nathan. But never had she planned on expending her best efforts to fight the others.</p>

  <p>And as for Karl and Lucille, they lost the battles merely because they were weaker than the others.</p>

  <p>Now, the top five warriors were to fight each other.</p>

  <p>Out of these five warriors, apart from Nathan, the other four hadn't been defeated at any instance.</p>

  <p>Even during the battles outside the main cities, the trials within the various secret realms, and the expedition in the Hall of Causality, they hadn't lost once.</p>

  <p>With the greatest luck, strength, and perseverance, they were now known as the top warriors of the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Countless warriors across the universe had their eyes fixed on them.</p>

  <p>"I think Shania is stronger than the other four!"</p>

  <p>"Nathan is the best among the Godly Geniuses. I bet all my fortune on him!"</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that Kurt has become a Buddha."</p>

  <p>Becoming a Buddha meant that one had officially stepped onto the Buddhist path.</p>

  <p>Such was similar to how Nathan turned into a 'God' after becoming a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>As the warriors discussed the top five warriors, the biggest gamble they had made was already taking place.</p>

  <p>If the chips placed on these five warriors were gathered, they would sum up to a great amount of life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>Stones were constantly appearing on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>In each of the previous battles, only a stone was left on the board.</p>

  <p>But in the first battle this time, six black stones and six white stones appeared on the board. Simultaneously, the thirteen pieces that had already landed on the board were taken away.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the huge hand no longer held the stones and the mysterious girl announced coldly, "First battle� Luo Zheng Luo versus Shania."</p>
