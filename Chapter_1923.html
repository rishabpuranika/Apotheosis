<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1923 A Debate </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Preternatural flames raged from the cave entrance as if an evil dragon lurked in its depths and constantly fired its burning breath.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race, the Skyland race, and the Harmony race gathered at the entrance and waited.</p>

  <p>It was extremely hot, so much so that if a basin of water was placed here, it would completely evaporate in mere seconds.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, this extreme temperature wasn't much of a threat to the warriors present though it still made them feel quite restless.</p>

  <p>All of them still thought of the door.</p>

  <p>"I finally managed to bring Luo Luo Zheng to this place but how could I have known that it would end up like this?" Chapman lamented.</p>

  <p>Kaydan's face was also filled with gloom as he stared at the cave entrance. This entire debacle was unacceptable and the strangeness of it all made him feel as if he had been hoodwinked by someone. It was understandable that he was feeling extremely furious by this sudden turn of events.</p>

  <p>Tilton of the Harmony race, on the other hand remained calm. In fact, all the warriors of the Harmony race spent this time sitting cross-legged on the scorching rocks and silently cultivating their minds. There was no use waiting around and wasting idle time for them.</p>

  <p>As for Han Liusu, she couldn't really think of any solutions right now. She hadn't the slightest idea of what happened to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'You can't really be refined by Holy Drew. I'm counting on you to take me to the Soul Suppressing Cliff like you promised, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>"Han Liusu, it's so hot in here..." Aleyna complained.</p>

  <p>She had the lowest cultivation level amongst all warriors present so her ability to resist the extremely high temperature wasn't as strong.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu shot Kennan a look and he hurriedly took out a blue, thin, jade hairpin. It looked deceptively ordinary but was actually a treasure even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>She took the hairpin and put it on Aleyna who then felt a chill that eased the heat somewhat.</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors present easily recognized this hairpin. They couldn't help but feel jealous of the Han Clan at that moment since it was a large family with plentiful wealth and a collection of all kinds of treasures.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Kaydan roared as he stood. Life vitality surged in his body and disturbed the airflow around them. The heat wave swirled around him and made him look extremely formidable. "We cannot keep waiting here. Let me have a look in the cave!"</p>

  <p>None of the three races had the ability to enter this cave but Kaydan had mastered a secret technique that would allow him to catch a glimpse of whatever was happening inside. This technique was called Eye of Void.</p>

  <p>Kaydan stretched out his hands and a dense stream of life vitality burst forth and formed into a small vortex. This vortex looked like a black hole that constantly sucked out life vitality from its surroundings. Soon enough, a blazing white Space Law appeared in the vortex.</p>

  <p>This technique of creating an eye to see what was happening in other places was nothing difficult for other warriors. Even the Eastern Region's Cloud Sect could make Picture Slabs by fusing life vitality with arrays.</p>

  <p>However, the preternatural flames were so fierce that an ordinary method such as that would never work. Fortunately, this Eye of Void could barely break in.</p>

  <p>A bizarre eye appeared in Kaydan's hand after a while. This eye floated unsteadily in the air and was very faint. This was because it was constantly travelling back and forth in space.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A blazing bolt of Space Law pierced into one of Kaydan's eyes. This connected the Eye of Void to his left eye where it transmitted everything it saw.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>With Kaydan's command, the Eye of Void entered into a layer of rock at the side.</p>

  <p>This Eye of Void could only last for a few seconds in the preternatural flames. Of course, he would not let it enter through the entrance of the cave. Instead, he made it enter through the rock. A moment later, all Kaydan could see were endless flames.</p>

  <p>This was exactly the same thing he saw last time.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, cracks began to appear on the Eye of Void's surface under the burning of the flames.</p>

  <p>"Door!"</p>

  <p>This time, Kaydan saw the door in the depths of the cave!</p>

  <p>His right eye suddenly burst open, as if he had seen something unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Chapman and the others waited with bated breath. "Kaydan, what did you see?" Chapman asked.</p>

  <p>"The door... it is open..." Kaydan declared.</p>

  <p>"What's inside the door?" Tilton, who was usually calm and collected, suddenly jumped up and asked.</p>

  <p>All six great races knew of the door's existence and all of them hoped that they'd be able to leave the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land through it. News of it being opened was a huge cause of concern.</p>

  <p>"F... flames?" Kaydan murmured.</p>

  <p>Everyone frowned. Wasn't this nonsense?</p>

  <p>The preternatural flames constantly spewed out from the cave. It was only natural that there were preternatural flames inside the cave. What was there to be surprised about?</p>

  <p>"That's not ordinary flames!"</p>

  <p>From the corner of Kaydan's left eye, he saw specks of black flames, which flocked out like demons?</p>

  <p>The preternatural flames around them were fierce but these black flames were a different matter altogether. Facing these black flames, it was like a subject that submitted to the king, all the ordinary flames seemed to suddenly gain intelligence as they avoided the black flames along with the door from which they gushed forth.</p>

  <p>"Can you see what's inside the door?" Chapman asked.</p>

  <p>Kaydan shook his head in response. Even if he tried his best to make out whatever was inside the black flames, it seemed as if they devoured all light around the door so that it was impossible to see anything clearly.</p>

  <p>However, his body stiffened and a strange expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"What is it this time? What did you see?" another person asked.</p>

  <p>"... Two people," Kaydan replied.</p>

  <p>"Is it Luo Luo Zheng and the one-eyed man?"</p>

  <p>Kaydan shook his head.</p>

  <p>What he saw instead was Tianming and Holy Jay!</p>

  <p>Holy Jay slowly walked over the preternatural flames and reached out for the Eye of Void. Soon enough, Kaydan's left eye could no longer see anything...</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>The lightning bolt, which connected Kaydan's eye to the Eye of Void, suddenly shattered and severed the connection.</p>

  <p>"If it's not them, who did you see?" Chapman asked. "Why did it last so much shorter than last time?"</p>

  <p>They were able to see inside the cave for about half a minute last time.</p>

  <p>Since Kaydan was more prepared then it should've lasted a bit longer this time around.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who they were. Two strangers. One of them crushed my Eye of Void," Kayden murmured in anger.</p>

  <p>Their journey had been quite smooth after entering the interior world, however, none of them ever expected they'd experience so many strange things after. Just where did these strange fellows come from? Why weren't they afraid of the preternatural flames?</p>

  <p>Within the cave, Holy Jay held a small eyeball in his hand.</p>

  <p>"They think that this door will allow them to leave the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. What they don't know is that this door is merely a furnace prepared for Luo Luo Zheng. They could all lead carefree lives here. Why do they want to leave?"</p>

  <p>Tianming also looked at the eye. "These people... Did you create them?"</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded. "Most of them. They've been quite troublesome, causing chaos right ever since I created them."</p>

  <p>Tianming smiled. "You are wrong to set such limitations."</p>

  <p>"How so?" Holy Jay asked.</p>

  <p>"Although I have never been to the divine land, I do know of a creature's heart. Wherever a creature resides, they would always evolve and pursue higher levels of cultivation. Even you aren't an exception to that, right?"</p>

  <p>Tianming said.</p>

  <p>A strange look appeared in Holy Jay's eyes, not really knowing how to refute his words.</p>

  <p>"This is the meaning of life," Tianming told him as he stared at the eyeball.</p>

  <p>"This doesn't have much meaning," Holy Jay said, shooting an indifferent glance at Tianming. He himself was wise and didn't need to be taught this simple lesson.</p>

  <p>Tianming did not really mind. "When a beggar is on the verge of starving to death, a single bun might be even more meaningful compared to a True God earning the title of Holy Being." Tianming didn't care about Holy Jay's stare at all as a confident and calm smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>His words caused Holy Jay to stiffen and become somewhat speechless.</p>

  <p>Once he entered the Holy Realm and built the land, he knew everything about this vast world. However, he found himself unable to refute Tianming's words.</p>

  <p>He had not thought of such things for quite some time now.</p>
