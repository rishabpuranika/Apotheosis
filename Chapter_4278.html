<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4278 Make A Move </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All materials were made of energy, and all energy formed materials.</p>

  <p>The third-grade world, the Lower Extreme World, was made up of three thousand kinds of Divine Dao energy. Water, fire, wind, grass, wood, stone, and sand were all formed from the most basic Divine Dao energy.</p>

  <p>The energy of the Evil God's inner world was in abundant supply.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, all the materials in the fourth-grade world, the Grand Lower World, were formed by blood power.</p>

  <p>The fusion of blood power was actually a type of transformation. Once the Eternal Realm warrior inherited the blood power, they could just rely on their own blood supply from then on.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had not undergone this transformation. He was not an Eternal Realm master, and thus, still tapped on to the energy of the Source World.</p>

  <p>It had always proven sufficient for his needs, anyway. The current Source World was so vast and huge that the energy it contained had been enough for the Evil God's use so far.</p>

  <p>However, the consumption of Extreme Form energy in the Deep Space was a different matter entirely.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't dare waste energy coming from the Source World at will, and he lit up one hundred and forty kinds of Extreme Form energy only when showing that to the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran.</p>

  <p>"You see, if we can master the Extreme Form energy, we can improve our strength without limit. I'm willing to cultivate it," said Duran.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven nodded. "The power at this advanced level is certainly far greater. It's on a completely different level. Teach me and I will forever be grateful!"</p>

  <p>Having witnessed the display, Duran, too, came to acknowledge that Extreme Form energy surpassed blood power in all aspects.</p>

  <p>"As you wish." The Evil God knew they'd make that choice.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at the end of the hall. There was a staircase there leading to a higher floor.</p>

  <p>"So there's still a fourth floor here. Does it have an even higher-level power?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven knew the Evil God better than Duran did.</p>

  <p>He knew the Evil God was extremely selfish. If he was willing to teach them something, it only meant he was hiding the stronger strength in his arsenal.</p>

  <p>He had heard the Evil God mention the Field last time. In such a short period of time, he had already thoroughly comprehended the power of the Deep Space. It was highly likely he had also mastered the higher-level power.</p>

  <p>"The fourth floor is not open for the time being," the Evil God said curtly.</p>

  <p>He waved his hand dismissively and left the matter at that.</p>

  <p>Both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran raised a brow at this, but kept quiet.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was probably the most talented warrior they had ever met.</p>

  <p>Just then, a voice piped up in the mind of the Evil God. It was a message from the Evil God acting as the sentry.</p>

  <p>The Evil God tilted his head, narrowing his eyes as he listened. His lips curled into a sneer. "Something strange is going on with the primitive land."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's primitive land?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God nodded. "It appears to be flying to the right and speeding up."</p>

  <p>"Why is it doing that?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked with concern.</p>

  <p>The Evil God shook his head. "I don't know yet either."</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng had obtained the power of the Deep Space, infusing the primitive land with greater strength. It was huge progress, but he felt even that wasn't enough to match up to the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had warned Luo Zheng that neither of them should act rashly about it. He could just let the primitive land devour the heads and grow stronger.</p>

  <p>After all, the larger the primitive land became, the more energy it contained. So this sudden move seemed unwise of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to follow them?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God pondered for a moment and answered in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>The Source World alone wouldn't be enough to deal with the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The Evil God intended to bring the Source World and Luo Zheng's primitive land closer together so they could join forces.</p>

  <p>They would just be defeated in succession if they acted alone.</p>

  <p>Hence, two hours later, the huge Source World began to turn slowly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God working as the sentry shook the thick black chains on his body and stretched out a hand. "Thirty degrees towards west, rotate!"</p>

  <p>The whole Source World revolved slowly under his command.</p>

  <p>When the Source World had turned thirty degrees, the sentry barked out,</p>

  <p>"Move forward!"</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The Source World started to move forward, growing faster and faster as time went by.</p>

  <p>The authority to control the Source World actually lay with the real Evil God.</p>

  <p>The sentry only predicted the actions of the Evil God and relayed the orders.</p>

  <p>As this happened, a giant pyramid spun at high speed in the depths of the chaos.</p>

  <p>This was the Burial Land that had already massively expanded.</p>

  <p>The Burial Land was filled with chaotic power, dark and obscure.</p>

  <p>As the Burial Land grew, the monsters that inhabited it also became immensely powerful.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't dare to approach the mountain at the center of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>The master of this world was staying on that mountain. It was a giant snake.</p>

  <p>The giant snake had a nasty disposition. He devoured any living creature that dared to approach him. The area within a thousand miles around the mountain thus became the dangerous, forbidden territory.</p>

  <p>Just then, two moon-shaped objects appeared over the mountain top. The monsters knew what they really were.</p>

  <p>They were the eyes of the awakened giant snake.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The downgrader materialized on top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King lowered his head. "Greetings, downgrader."</p>

  <p>The downgrader once referred to himself only as the black light to the Snake Spirit King. The Snake Spirit King never imagined that the black light was actually the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The downgrader only revealed his true identity after the battle in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>That was when Cornelius realized he would never be able to return his hometown, the main world.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's only value to the downgrader now and his only chance of survival were to control the Burial Land well.</p>

  <p>"They're all on the move," the downgrader said.</p>

  <p>"On the move? Where are they headed?" the Snake Spirit King asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Thirty degrees to the west," the downgrader said, pointing in a direction.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King seemed a little surprised at this. "Are they looking for my daughter?" he asked, after a pause.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Snake Girl," the downgrader corrected.</p>

  <p>"But how did they know her location?" the Snake Spirit King asked.</p>

  <p>The chaos was so huge that even huge chaos clouds seemed insignificant.</p>

  <p>What more a person?</p>

  <p>It should have been impossible to find her. She was embedded in the inner wall of the chaos, after all.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Extreme Form," the downgrader replied. "The Illusory Vision in the Soul Extreme Form can explore the boundless world. They used this method to find the Blood Snake Girl."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King drew a breath. "How did they obtain the power of the Deep Space?"</p>

  <p>The downgrader's six pairs of eyes flickered down.</p>

  <p>Like the members of the Four Spirits Sect, he, too, was unable to return to the main world. He had deployed the irregular heavy sword and controlled the Starry Roc-fish, but even then, he had failed to prevent Luo Nian from taking back the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>His failure would always bring him deep shame.</p>

  <p>"They can still be defeated even if they have the Deep Space power," the downgrader said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Are you planning something?" The Snake Spirit King's interest was piqued.</p>

  <p>All his dreams had been shattered, but his malevolence remained intact.</p>

  <p>He knew he was on a slow descent to hell, but he hoped that he could bring everyone down with him.</p>
