  <p>Elder Xu was stunned at what Kenneth said. It was quite high praise.</p>

  <p>Kenneth worked for the Cloud Hall and his knowledge went beyond the entirety of the Eastern Region. He had seen the other side of the world.</p>

  <p>Billions of people lived in the Eastern Region, and the Central Region was over ten times larger than the Eastern Region. The five regions in total did not dominate the globe as one thought. They were but a small corner of the main continent on the map.</p>

  <p>The world was composed of people as many as the number of sand particles in the sea. It was almost impossible to keep count of.</p>

  <p>In this vast population, there were a number of geniuses. Luo Luo Zheng had good talent and even better luck, but it was likely that there were people more powerful than him out there.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Elder Xu was shocked at Luo Zheng's performance. The younger generation was better than the last, but could he really afford Kenneth's evaluation of being the reincarnation of an immortal? What did it mean for the world?</p>

  <p>Watching Elder Xu at a loss for words and looking like he couldn't accept Kenneth's statement, the latter smiled softly. "Just kidding. Elder Xu, don't take it so seriously."</p>

  <p>"..." Elder Xu was more than a hundred years old. Hearing the leader make such a joke out of the blue, he remained petrified for a while, not knowing how to react.</p>

  <p>"But Luo Luo Zheng is truly special. No big shots were from his family in the past.</p>

  <p>It could be that his background and bloodline is ordinary, but in this generation, two heavyweights have been discovered already, Yan, who has a peculiar body constitution, and then Luo Luo Zheng, who has incredible strength. They appeared successively. Don't you think that's a strange coincidence?" Kenneth asked him.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu shook his head. "Yes, it's a perplexing coincidence. But I don't find it too strange."</p>

  <p>Kenneth looked at the competition field and watched Luo Zheng's Streamer Sword reflecting the sunlight, with specks of gold glinting as the weapon flexed. He said, "In fact, I don't find it strange either. I just feel that heaven makes surprising arrangements. It must be fate. Luo Luo Zheng could be the dragon hiding in deep waters, but that wouldn't stop me from pushing him ahead. His current performance is exemplary. If he gets achievements in the Cloud Hall someday, it would benefit me."</p>

  <p>To enter any sect in this wide world was not easy, but the Cloud Hall would welcome a genius. After all, if a sect wanted to develop and get stronger, they must discover and cultivate these unmatched talents cyclically.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng made massive achievements in the future, Kenneth would stand to gain a lot from Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu nodded silently. As a subordinate, he could not speak up and interfere in the leader's arrangements. Kenneth seldom showed up. The fact that he was willing to talk to Elder Xu for so long and that he opened up to his subordinate was enough.</p>

  <p>On the competition field, Tianming remained silent. He needed time to digest the shock Luo Luo Zheng had brought on.</p>

  <p>After a while, he said, "I started learning swordsmanship when I was six years old, and then comprehended a small part of the sword intent at the age of ten. When I was thirteen, I grasped the sword intent. And then I entered the consummation of nature level at sixteen. Even the ones who have reached the early stage of the Illuminating Soul Realm do not qualify to be my opponents. In the Eastern Region, few people are worthy of my admiration. Patrick was the first to deserve it. Luo Luo Zheng, you are the second. But make no mistake, I will use all my strength in this round.</p>

  <p>I will leave no stone unturned."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "Start the fight."</p>

  <p>The two geniuses didn't need to partake in offensive speech in this battle.</p>

  <p>They had real strength, and they were solid and firm like massive rocks.</p>

  <p>They knew that neither of them could get a rise out of the other through loose talk. Furthermore, a swordsman took a path of justice. What they learnt from each other through their swordsmanship would be invaluable.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't get so far with throwaway words.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Tianming inched his Blood-corroding Sword closer to himself and the weapon seemed to hiss. Shifting his feet, he began the strange Sword Step.</p>

  <p>Watching Tianming, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't hide the admiration in his eyes. If he was honest, Tianming comprehended the sword more deeply than him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't been cultivating the sword for long. He might have comprehended the sword intent and even caught up to Tianming in this skill, but he couldn't blend himself with his sword like Tianming. The latter was a natural at this.</p>

  <p>Tianming's Sword Step grew faster and faster, sword energy cyclones manifesting under his feet continuously.</p>

  <p>"I will begin as well!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng too moved his feet to the rhythms of the Sword Step.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng carried out his Sword Step according to Tianming's, there was a slight difference between the two.</p>

  <p>Tianming's Sword Step was smooth in effect. Seen carefully, each step was calculated and equal in length to the three-foot long cutting edge of his Blood-corroding Sword. His Sword Step appeared soft but hid the killing intent cleverly. Once the edge was exposed, the killing intent would make itself known too.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng's Sword Step looked random, yet natural. His steps were not as soft as Tianming's, but appeared more potent in power.</p>

  <p>The two stepped forward, setting a tempo with their feet as they faced each other on the competition field, looking for loopholes and mistakes in the opponent's moves.</p>

  <p>But since they had cultivated to this level, they knew how to hold on to their nerves. They wouldn't make mistakes easily.</p>
