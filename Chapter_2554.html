  <p>Romeo had never imagined that he could narrowly escape death. What just happened was like a nightmare!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sudden appearance had helped reverse the end result especially for him at death's door.</p>

  <p>He was still in disbelief as he felt that he hadn't gone back yet on his senses.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" Romeo faced Luo Zheng as he earnestly cupped his hands. "I, Romeo, will never forget that you have saved my life."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only smiled faintly and uttered, "Even if I didn't make a move, after killing you, they would still come to kill me. It would count as I'm also saving myself. Don't take it to heart."</p>

  <p>Romeo shook his head and said, "It's different! Without you, I couldn't have killed them."</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Sarah, Amos and Hiram immediately turned back to their original figure and rushed straight over.</p>

  <p>"Sir, are you okay? You have defeated three Yellow Emperor members all by yourself. I bet that among the young generation of the Nine Li race, no one can defeat you... " Amos praised Romeo with a flattering expression on his face.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Romeo was a nobleman who was beyond his reach.</p>

  <p>Going through the crisis together, he naturally would seize this opportunity to play up to Romeo. He was expecting that he might get the chance to enter a bone tower and even join the Nine Li race in the future!</p>

  <p>Sarah and Hiram on the side both frowned upon hearing Amos' flattering words towards Romeo.</p>

  <p>Anyone who wasn't blind could see and understand that the one who played the key role in winning the battle was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Luo Zheng's powerful soul attack, every single one of them would have turned into corpses, including Romeo.</p>

  <p>Amos was the blind one, shamelessly talking nonsense just to flatter Romeo.</p>

  <p>Romeo glanced at him indifferently. These Wild Gods were nothing important in his eyes, and he felt that this Amos was more like a clown.</p>

  <p>In the midst of their fight, he had seen that Sarah and Hiram were the ones who had gone all out to fight back, but Amos was just standing far away. Obviously, he had no intention of taking action.</p>

  <p>He had no expectations that these Wild Gods would save him. After all, they had Admission Tokens and their purpose of coming here was to collect wild bones, and they didn't have the obligation to save anyone from the Nine Li race. But deep in his heart, he had no good impression of this guy who did nothing but brazenly cosied up to him.</p>

  <p>Romeo just glanced at him but didn't respond. As the core disciple of the Nine Li race, he was clear about the secret of the bone towers.</p>

  <p>There were so many Wild Gods in this world. After three years, they would all die under the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate that a vast majority of people had no idea that death was rapidly approaching.</p>

  <p>"We can't stay in this area of Immemorial Wilderness any longer. The Yellow Emperor race has made a big move and this place is very dangerous. Will you leave with me?" Romeo asked as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He rather had a good impression on Luo Zheng, and he was a bit unwilling to let someone with such talent go.</p>

  <p>He thought Luo Zheng was even qualified to enter a bone tower, and in determination would like to recommend him to the leaders.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng shook his head and replied, "I still have to dig out the wild bones first. I will come to you in the future."</p>

  <p>He naturally wouldn't let go of such an opportunity to enter the Nine Li race. However, entering the Immemorial Wilderness was not an easy feat, and he had just dug out two pieces of blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>He felt reluctant to leave right now.</p>

  <p>"Dig the wild bones..." Romeo smiled and offered, "I can give you one million wild bones!"</p>

  <p>A million wild bones was not a small amount for Romeo, but he could still afford it.</p>

  <p>He didn't like the idea of owing others a favor. If Luo Zheng would be willing to accept the one million wild bones, he could at least repay him for saving his life.</p>

  <p>"One million?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows at Romeo's offer.</p>

  <p>He was tempted by such a large number of wild bones, but in the end, he still refused the generous offer.</p>

  <p>He felt that the offer was much more than he could deserve. On the other hand, with his speed of digging the wild bones, it wouldn't be too difficult for him to accumulate a million pieces in this area of Immemorial Wilderness. More importantly, he really needed to get the blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>Romeo was a bit disappointed hearing Luo Zheng's refusal.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, with this guy's soul force, it wouldn't be very dangerous for him to dig here as long as he didn't encounter powerful Wild Gods who would attack him.</p>

  <p>After all, this guy had the Admission Token of the Nine Li race. He then accepted Luo Zheng's refusal and didn't push further. He decided to go back first and report this to the elders of the race. Finding Luo Zheng would not be difficult if he wanted.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, he took away belongings of the three Yellow Emperor members and handed over a few items to Luo Zheng. Lastly, he asked about Sarah's and Hiram's names then instructed, "For the wild bones you have dug out this time, you three don't have to hand in a portion of them to our Nine Li race. I'll tell this to the person in charge."</p>

  <p>Half of the bones dug out in this part of the Immemorial Wilderness would be given to the Nine Li race. There were some people who were unwilling to let the Nine Li race have a share of their wild bones, and as a result, they were killed by the powerful warriors sent by the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Now no one dared break the rule.</p>

  <p>Sarah and Hiram felt overjoyed by Romeo's statement. A faint smile also appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>As for Amos, who was standing beside, had a very long face. Romeo had mentioned three names referring to Luo Zheng, Sarah and Hiram, but his name was not included.</p>

  <p>Romeo didn't care about how Amos would feel.</p>

  <p>After bidding goodbye to Luo Zheng, he rose up and flew rapidly to get out of the Immemorial Wilderness...</p>

  <p>"Are you still going to dig wild bones here?" Luo Zheng asked as he looked at Sarah.</p>

  <p>Sarah was in all honesty frightened. She had wanted to go back.</p>

  <p>Romeo had already told them that they didn't need to hand in any wild bones to Nine Li race. It was indeed a great opportunity. After all, the wild bones she would finally get this time would be doubled compared to the past.</p>

  <p>It would also be helpful having Luo Zheng around with his strength and ability.</p>

  <p>It was the most important as she felt safe and secure with him.</p>

  <p>She had clearly seen that Luo Zheng had fully relied on his own abilities to kill Bilaal.</p>

  <p>Romeo had also killed two Yellow Emperor Wild Gods, but he wouldn't have been successful without Luo Zheng's soul attack.</p>

  <p>Even without Romeo, Luo Zheng might have killed all these Wild Gods all by himself.</p>

  <p>Tagging along with a powerful warrior digging out the wild bones, she felt that she could do anything she wanted in this Immemorial Wilderness. She doubted that the Yellow Emperor race would send any more powerful people here just to kill them.</p>

  <p>Among the four people, only Amos was depressed. Luo Zheng, Sarah and Hiram weren't much affected and began to busy themselves digging for wild bones.</p>

  <p>The Admission Tokens issued by the Nine Li race had a time limit. They were only given a time limit of eighteen days with the Admission Tokens they had.</p>

  <p>On the first day, Luo Zheng collected about ten thousand wild bones, and had also dug out two wild bones with Chiyou's bloodline. Much more that in the following days, he was still fortunate to have good luck on his side.</p>

  <p>On the second day, although he didn't get any blood wild bone, he dug out a big wild bone which was over twenty feet tall! Sarah was green with envy with the turn of events.</p>

  <p>On the third day, Luo Zheng dug out three blood wild bones. The three blood wild bones, however, were not the blood wild bones with Chiyou's bloodline.</p>

  <p>The following days, collecting the wild bones had gone smoothly without distractions. Perhaps it was because the Yellow Emperor race was busily planning on seizing the Sky South Bone Tower, the Immemorial Wilderness was very peaceful during this period of time.</p>

  <p>Eighteen days were already up. Luo Zheng had accumulated nearly two hundred thousand wild bones. In addition to that, he also obtained seven or eight kinds of blood wild bones, the total number of which added up to dozens.</p>

  <p>Despite the total number of wild bones he got, he was a little upset that there were only four blood wild bones that contained Chiyou's bloodline.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Sarah and Hiram had returned back fully loaded. But for Amos, perhaps he felt unhappy by not receiving the same treatment as the other three had, so he was depressed the whole time, making him leave the Immemorial Wilderness ahead of time.</p>
