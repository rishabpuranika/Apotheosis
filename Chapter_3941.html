</p>

  <p>As the ordinary Diabolic Demons came into contact with the poisonous Diabolic Earth, they also turned black and quickly fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Originally, these Diabolic Demons could be resurrected. However, as soon as they revived, they were poisoned to death again.</p>

  <p>Generally, ordinary Diabolic Demons could easily resurrect for up to three times. After that, they would have a really hard time recovering their bodies. The powerful ones could be revived more than thrice, but the Diabolic Earth that they used to revive themselves were tainted with a vicious poison. Thus, whenever they resurrected, they couldn't escape the fate of dying again.</p>

  <p>Even the king wasn't able to save himself when he came into contact with the Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>The other three kings were lucky to prevent themselves from making contact with the Diabolic Earth. As soon as they realized that it was severely poisoned, they immediately leaped and floated in the air.</p>

  <p>As the black spots spread at an incredible rate, their faces darkened and they were horrified at the scene.</p>

  <p>All of the Diabolic Demons were actually a whole, and their core was the Diabolic Earth below.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful their enemies were, it was always difficult to invade the Land of Diabolic Demons. There was no way to conquer a land that was guarded by immortal beings. Furthermore, there were tens of thousands of Diabolic Demons that would welcome those who dared to enter their land.</p>

  <p>As long as the Diabolic Demons were given enough time to expand the Diabolic Earth, they would be able to join the Supreme Pure Realm in the near future.</p>

  <p>No one expected that the Diabolic Demons would encounter such a great crisis.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>The land that turned to black began vibrating. Then, the ground not far away from Zheng swelled and bulged high until a blood-red monster finally drilled out from it. However, only half of its original form was seen.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, it also turned to black and disintegrated like the other Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>In reality, the Diabolic Earth itself was also a living creature. After it was severely poisoned, it started struggling so hard. The huge creature that got out from the ground and instantly disintegrated, was actually an incarnation of the Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>After about two hours, the black spots had already spread to the edge of the Land of Diabolic Demons, about hundreds of miles away from where Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Near the Diabolic Earth's edge, there were clusters of pale yellow plants growing on it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, there were also a few striped deer covetously keeping an eye on these yellow plants, which were their favorite food.</p>

  <p>However, the current situation of the Land of Diabolic Demons was extremely dangerous. An ominous atmosphere kept the animals from getting any closer.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, the deer that found the yellow plants hadn't eaten for a few days, which was why their hunger triumphed over their fear as they rushed to the plants without hesitation.</p>

  <p>At this moment, about seven Diabolic Demons suddenly surfaced from the nearby red soil and surrounded the group of deer. It turned out that the yellow plants were actually bait placed by the Diabolic Demons to lure other creatures.</p>

  <p>However, just as they pounced on the deer, the black poison quickly spread under their feet. Before they even touched the deer, their bodies collapsed, and the frightened deer fled in all directions.</p>

  <p>After collapsing and recovering for a few times, the Diabolic Demons completely died. The originally blood-red Diabolic Earth was now completely enveloped in darkness.</p>

  <p>The frightened group of deer waited and observed for a long time if there was any Diabolic Demon that was still lurking. Upon seeing the quiet land, they happily jumped into the area and chewed on the yellow plants.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, when they came into contact with the black Diabolic Earth, where the yellow plants were, nothing bad happened to them.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the poison that Zheng introduced into the Diabolic Earth could only affect the Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>The three remaining kings floated in the air and glared at Zheng with furious faces. Zheng had destroyed everything, including the altar, the race, and even the foundation of the Diabolic Earth. They were fuming with rage and wanted to get back at him as soon as they could.</p>

  <p>"Human brat! Come up here and I'll give you a swift death!"</p>

  <p>"Just you wait, and I'm going to devour your flesh!"</p>

  <p>"I advise you to leave the Land of Diabolic Demons while you still can!"</p>

  <p>The poison that contaminated the Diabolic Earth was so intense that it could instantly destroy and kill the Diabolic Demons. Even the kings didn't dare to come down and only shouted in disdain while they were up in the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng just smiled at them. He slowly dug his toe into the ground, and violently kicked upwards.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The black soil quickly spread towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The three kings were caught off guard and were scared out of their wits.</p>

  <p>They immediately flew up to a higher place as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>However, one of the kings was a bit slow, and wasn't able to dodge the black soil.</p>

  <p>"Aaargh!"</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the king fell from the sky and crashed into the black soil.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, his whole body disintegrated without a trace.</p>

  <p>This time, however, the king didn't come back to life.</p>

  <p>The resurrection ability of the Diabolic Demons came from the Diabolic Earth. Since it was now engulfed by the deadly poison, the Diabolic Demons had lost their ability to be resurrected, and even their kings were no exception.</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng ignored the remaining two kings above him. He headed north as soon as he determined the direction he needed to take.</p>

  <p>However, the two kings still followed him from behind, keeping a safe distance.</p>

  <p>They didn't have the slightest intention of letting Zheng go. They were just waiting for an opportunity to attack him as soon as he left the Diabolic Earth.</p>

  <p>'Hmm. It'll be a little troublesome if they keep following me. I need to lose them somehow.'</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, he finally knew what his plan would be. He immediately dug a hole in the area and hopped inside it.</p>

  <p>The two kings didn't expect that Zheng would do such a thing. They didn't dare follow him into the hole because their lives would be in grave danger.</p>

  <p>After crossing a wide distance inside the Diabolic Earth, Zheng came out on the other side and didn't sense the presence of the kings.</p>

  <p>"As I move north from the center of the Land of Diabolic Demons, I will be able to see two isolated peaks. The first one is the Spirit Disappearing Peak, and the other one is the Soul Dissipating Peak. Oh, there they are," Zheng said as he stared at the two peaks in the distance.</p>

  <p>As he was approaching, he saw two mountains were standing in an arc on the left side and on the right side. One was pure silver in color, and the other was golden.</p>

  <p>According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, these two mountains were indestructible. Every chaotic era, an alien space door would open at the place between the two mountains. Many Other Shore creatures and Eternal Realm warriors in the Grand Pure Realm would gather and break into it to explore the area.</p>

  <p>The door would only open once every chaotic era, so he couldn't wait for that time to happen.</p>

  <p>After finding a well-hidden corner, Zheng quietly chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune and instantly withdrew from the Grand Pure Realm. He decided to let the Snake Goddess and Fuxi know where he was.</p>

  <p>The people of the Oneness Sky Palace hoped that Zheng could rescue Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasmin as soon as possible. To be able to do it, Zheng needed to meet with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi first.</p>

  <p>The fact that Zheng had entered the Three Purities Stage was a big deal for the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill, the Oneness Sky Palace, and even several Chaos Ancient Gods paid close attention to Zheng's journey.</p>

  <p>Normally, as long as one didn't encounter any sort of trouble, they would choose to wake up as soon as they arrived at the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was delayed, which made the masters in the Pear Hill a little worried. They started to think that something must have gone wrong after he arrived at the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng safely left the Other Shore and opened his eyes. He perceived that the Dark Haze Peak suddenly became noisy as he woke up.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has finally woken up!"</p>

  <p>"Really? Then that means he's safe!"</p>

  <p>"I told you that we need not worry." Fuxi was standing beside him and quickly asked, "Where have you been transmitted by the Stage End Passage? You were out for quite a long time."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around first and saw No. 9527, who was also beside him. He put on a helpless expression because of the number of people that were present. Zheng was a very important figure now that even Chaos Ancient Gods visited him several times. All of these people even wanted to sleep there every day just to check up on him. There was no way that No. 9527 could stop them.</p>

  <p>After Zheng answered Fuxi, there was a sudden silence in the entire Dark Haze Peak. They couldn't believe what Zheng had just said. All of their faces were immediately filled with horror as they heard its name.</p>

  <p>"Did he just say...the Land of Diabolic Demons?"</p>
