</p>

  <p>They were in one of the fairy palace's chambers.</p>

  <p>Xun leaned her face against Zheng's chest as she breathed evenly and slowly. She had fallen asleep.</p>

  <p>On the opposing side, Yudie was equally curled up under Zheng's arm, sleeping deep like a baby.</p>

  <p>With their cultivation levels, they generally didn't need sleep in order to replenish their energy. For most of the year, they could simply sit cross-legged for a short while to maintain their full energy.</p>

  <p>That said, these past days were different.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, sleep wasn't just sleep. In fact, it could have a special meaning.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved his arm slightly, and Xun immediately opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>She looked up at Zheng with her red eyes, like a vigilant kitten. She was on her guard.</p>

  <p>Yudie, on his other side, also woke up. The moment her soul fully awakened, the ridiculous scene of the three of them having a passionate night replayed in her mind. Her face couldn't help but redden and she was very embarrassed. "Zheng, yesterday, I..."</p>

  <p>As she noticed Yudie's hesitation, Xun intentionally said indifferently, "What's done is done. There's no need to feel ashamed."</p>

  <p>Yudie's expression looked everything but natural as she listened to Xun speak. Her mouth opened, but she didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>Instead, she grabbed the blanket and whipped it over herself in order to better cover her body.</p>

  <p>"Xun," Zheng murmured as he gently patted her head.</p>

  <p>Xun quickly revealed a complacent smile.</p>

  <p>"Get up, or Geoffrey will complain again," Zheng said as he smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng had gotten dressed and peered out, he was met with the sound of a spear whooshing through the air.</p>

  <p>As Zheng walked out and turned the corner, he came face to face with Geoffrey and his spear, who was charging and jabbing at Joy relentlessly.</p>

  <p>"Has Joy finished her closed-door cultivation, yet?" Zheng's eyes lit up and opened wide.</p>

  <p>As Zheng looked closer at Joy's bodily movement skill, a very special feeling crept over him.</p>

  <p>Her body moved around in an elegant manner. She seemed to change position gracefully, as though she was dancing without giving it any thought. As she fluttered around Geoffrey's long spear, Zheng couldn't help himself but think that she resembled a butterfly. The scene was very harmonious, to say the least.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Truth of Godly Way has provided her with great benefit," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Before long, Yudie walked over. When she saw Geoffrey making an attack at Joy while muttering something, she raised her eyebrows in surprise. She was always worried that Geoffrey would get hurt.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Joy and Geoffrey only sparred with each other for a short while.</p>

  <p>When Joy noticed Zheng, she flicked her spear away and, without a moment's hesitation, she walked over to him.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Joy! You have comprehended the Truth of Godly Way!" Zheng said cheerfully, a toothy grin spread on his face.</p>

  <p>She glanced at Zheng, shook her head and said, "Not yet. I've only comprehended half of the Sanskrit passage on the Truth of Godly Way, actually. But you really seemed to have a good time after returning to the fairy palace, huh?"</p>

  <p>Yudie couldn't help but overhear the conversation and was immediately embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's grin faded a little. He knew that Joy was going to lecture him as the elder she was.</p>

  <p>At that very moment though, a loud vibration sound suddenly came from outside the fairy palace!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>It sounded as if countless huge animals were running crazily outside.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression changed in a flash. He followed Joy's gaze and looked toward the fairy palace's main entrance.</p>

  <p>"Master! It seems that several ferocious beasts are coming our way!"</p>

  <p>Saul informed Zheng hastily.</p>

  <p>Zheng narrowed his eyes and said, "Well, go have a look!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was still calm as he was very confident that the fairy palace built by his master wouldn't be easily invaded.</p>

  <p>First of all, the layer of enchanted barrier was almost unbreakable. So much so, in fact, that it could even split the fairy palace from the divine land, ensuring that the people within it wouldn't be turned into life vitality!</p>

  <p>The beasts in the Swirl Forest were ferocious, sure, but they couldn't enter the fairy palace. Zheng had no doubt about it.</p>

  <p>Instead of waiting for Saul, Zheng took the lead and rushed out of the fairy palace. He stood in front of the light pink enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The huge trees in the Swirl Forest snapped repeatedly as they fell down to the ground one by one. The sound of messy, uneven footsteps rushed in, as if there were thousands of troops galloping in the forest.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that?" Yudie asked as she followed closely behind Zheng, looking a little nervous.</p>

  <p>She had stayed in the fairy palace for so long now, and she would only occasionally look at the divine land through the enchanted barrier. From time to time, she'd see a few beasts with horrible auras, but those beasts didn't dare approach the enchanted barrier. The fairy palace was like a safe retreat away from the world.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It's probably the beasts out in the Swirl Forest!" Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>What Zheng was worried about weren't the beasts.</p>

  <p>Right now was a sensitive time for Zheng and Joy. They couldn't let anyone in the divine land discover where they were.</p>

  <p>If Nicholas and the others found out that they were hiding out in this fairy palace, the situation would become even more troublesome.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The tree trunk closest to the edge of the enchanted barrier exploded into hundreds of tiny wooden pieces.</p>

  <p>He saw two people emerge from the tree trunk. They immediately rushed toward the fairy palace at a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>Behind them was a large group of huge apes! They were being chased!</p>

  <p>Each huge ape measured at least seven thousand feet, and looked like a moving mountain. Every time they stomped the ground, a footstep-crater was left behind. The apes were so heavy their movements felt like earthquakes. Their bodies were huge and yet their movements so agile.</p>

  <p>They ragingly ran after the two people at a mad pace, using both their hands and feet.</p>

  <p>The person in front had long hair and a wide face. As he dashed forward crazily, he yelled, "Fuck! Why the hell are there so many apes? I said that we should have gone to the fairy palace first! That way we would've avoided running into such big problems!"</p>

  <p>Behind the first person in line was a boy.</p>

  <p>The boy sat on a cyan ox's back, which was also galloping insanely.</p>

  <p>"Those golden haired creatures have caught up to us," the boy said calmly. As he spoke, he also stood up on the cyan ox and lifted the fishing rod in his hand. His eyes narrowed slightly, flashing a murderous look.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, a few golden lights suddenly flashed from the crowd of the huge apes.</p>

  <p>Several golden small apes jumped down from the giant apes' backs and began pouncing on the two people.</p>

  <p>In comparison to the apes, which were like seven or eight thousand feet high mountains, the golden apes were only small in comparison. Despite that, the four golden apes were still over 30 feet tall, much taller than the boy and the man with long hair!</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>The boy snorted coldly, and he swung the rod in his hand with all his might!</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>A light golden fishing line was immediately cast out!</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff!</p>

  <p>Of the four golden apes that pounced toward them, three of the beasts were seriously injured. Blood gushed from their bodies, forming puddles the size of lakes around their feet.</p>

  <p>With the boy's strength, upon casting the fishing line, he caused ultimate injury. He was so powerful that even if a consummate True God was hit by his attack, they'd be seriously injured. As the golden fishing line sliced at the apes, it left cuts on their bodies.</p>

  <p>Despite their injuries, one of the golden apes relied on its strong instinct to avoid the fishing line thrown out by the boy and rushed toward him instead.</p>

  <p>It was then that the golden ape stretched out its fluffy big hand to catch the boy. The boy suddenly yet calmly blurted out, "Go."</p>

  <p>The boy on the cyan ox immediately disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Wait for me!"</p>

  <p>As the long haired man saw the boy use the spatial transference and appear in front of him, his face was full of indignation. As he jumped up, he also disappeared from his spot.</p>

  <p>As they continuously flashed using the spatial transference in order to move forward, the two of them got closer and closer to the fairy palace's enchanted barrier!</p>

  <p>"Is... Is that... Gus?"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, who had been standing behind the enchanted barrier, with his eyes wide open. The two individuals were moving so quickly that it was hard to tell.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know Hallet, though.</p>

  <p>He had once fought with Augustus on the True Path. He had a deep impression of Gus, and thus he recognized him in a single glance.</p>

  <p>Joy, who was standing beside Zheng, smiled and said, "Yeah, that's Hallet and Augustus!"</p>

  <p>"Can they even come inside? Should I open the enchanted barrier for them?" As he watched the scene before him, Zheng immediately became anxious.</p>

  <p>Before opening the enchanted barrier, Zheng had to send everyone in the fairy palace to the training tower. Otherwise, when the space in the fairy place was connected to the space outside, Yudie, Xun, and the rest would turn into life vitality and disappear.</p>
