<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2583 Anger </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A fierce battle had happened between the two men on the ground. Their powers matched up with each other's strength and agility. Soon, smoke billowed and covered everything in sight, blinding the spectators of the good fight scene below.</p>

  <p>Though everyone wasn't able to watch clearly what was happening, they continued to hear loud noises coming from the two warriors.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the smoke finally dissipated, and the two mountain-like giants revealed themselves.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes focused on these two people.</p>

  <p>One of them was Monty, whose two arms were now cut off. He had a huge wound on his neck, which was bleeding outwards. His huge pupils were even unfocused.</p>

  <p>The other one, Roy, looked like he had a hard beating as well. Many bruises appeared all over his body. The golden light around him was getting dim. Apparently, he had suffered some serious injuries too.</p>

  <p>"Bah! What a hard nut to crack!" Roy grumbled, as he saw the crowd watching them.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Monty's body began to shrink rapidly, his Wild God Power disappearing quickly.</p>

  <p>"Monty!"</p>

  <p>Erik shouted from afar, his face darkened and his eyes clouded with concern. Rushing towards Monty, he tried lifting him up.</p>

  <p>It was true that one's corporeal body had an unprecedented power after they cultivated the Wild God system, but once the Wild God was seriously injured, it would be difficult to repair the body. The world is fair, after all.</p>

  <p>The wound in Monty's neck made him lose a lot of blood, directly taking away his life.</p>

  <p>"How dare you kill him!" Erik exclaimed angrily, making his vigor and grand momentum emerge.</p>

  <p>Monty was one of Erik's disciples and they shared a bond. Erik had trained Monty all these years, treating him like his own son. He never imagined that this battle would end up this bad. He didn't expect that Monty would die here today. Erik felt his heart shattering into a thousand pieces as his grief took over.</p>

  <p>Even if Erik didn't reveal his Wild God body, his reaction still put a lot of pressure on Roy.</p>

  <p>Wiping the blood off his face, Roy sneered, "He clearly couldn't match my strength, yet he wasn't willing to admit defeat. He was digging his own grave. If he had given up earlier, this wouldn't have happened. He forced me to kill him!"</p>

  <p>"You..." Erik's emotions stirred up. Unable to restrain himself, he was actually about to kill Roy.</p>

  <p>"In the battle ring, one's death is never the other's fault. One must accept that if they get killed� they only have themselves to blame for being inferior to their opponent. Are you going to bully a junior now, Erik?" a thin old man commented, his voice ringing as the cold breeze surrounded them. Erik turned to see who it was, and found an elder from the Yellow Emperor race approaching.</p>

  <p>Witnessing what had happened to Monty, Adele was unable to hide her sorrow. She floated toward the battle ring as well.</p>

  <p>Coming from another direction, Lancelot, the Grand Elder of the Yellow Emperor race, also flew to the center of the deserted land.</p>

  <p>Having the Grand Elders of both sides approaching the center of the field caused tension to the crowd. The atmosphere became tensed.</p>

  <p>For the past few years, the two races had many conflicts, but none of them was big enough to trigger an actual war.</p>

  <p>"Since our warriors came to a duel, it is possible that one will get killed by the other. Adele, do you really think that we are just having a friendly duel?" Lancelot laughed, watching Adele's reaction.</p>

  <p>Adele floated in the air, her beautiful eyes flashing with a complicated expression. "Erik, take the corpse of Monty back," she ordered.</p>

  <p>"But..." Feeling annoyed, Erik was not planning to let Roy go that easily.</p>

  <p>"They are right. In the battle ring, if one gets killed, they only have themselves to blame. Monty lost the duel, and that's it." Adele turned around, not wanting to say more.</p>

  <p>Several elders of the Nine Li race, including Giacomo, were also indignant.</p>

  <p>If the Grand Elder gave the order to fight the Yellow Emperor race, they would not hesitate to strike the other race at all and were willing to fight until only one was left standing.</p>

  <p>However, since Adele's order was the law, they were unable to vent their anger.</p>

  <p>"Adele, you are reasonable as always. This is what I admire you most."</p>

  <p>Lancelot laughed dryly.</p>

  <p>Adele's eyes revealed a hint of coldness and sternness. "In the battle ring, if one is killed, they only have themselves to blame. This is not only applied to the members of our race, but to the members of your race too."</p>

  <p>After making sure that everyone heard her decision, Adele left and never looked back.</p>

  <p>Pressing her lips together, Elsa watched Erik carry Monty's lifeless body on his back.</p>

  <p>As an innocent girl, Elsa probably couldn't accept the fact that Monty, who was alive a moment ago, was now a dead man. Tears started to fill her eyes.</p>

  <p>Silence fell among the members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Never did they expect that they would lose twice in a row, making them lose a member.</p>

  <p>Standing still, Zheng remained calm as he continued to observe his surroundings.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Romeo was close to losing his usual calmness. He bit his lips, his eyes red with rage. Turning towards Adele, he said, "Grand Elder, according to the order, is it my turn to fight now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"Great!" Romeo's handsome face revealed a trace of ferocity. Holding a light green bamboo sword in his hand, he slowly walked forward without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Roy, who just finished his turn, was also seriously injured in the battle with Monty. More than his weary body, he felt completely drained by now.</p>

  <p>Although he had triumphantly killed Monty, he also lost his fighting power. According to the rules of this battle, the last match was actually considered a draw.</p>

  <p>How could the price of a draw be equivalent to Monty's life? This was too much for the Nine Li members to accept.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Romeo would fight in the third round, the Yellow Emperor race naturally wouldn't let Roy stay and fight. It would be like throwing him in a lion's den. Instead, they chose to nominate another player.</p>

  <p>If they let Roy go and fight Romeo, who was fuming mad, he would instantly kill his opponent.</p>

  <p>"Desmund, it's your turn now," Lancelot called out, not even looking towards Desmund's direction.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Grand Elder!" Desmund, who had been waiting for a long time, bowed to Lancelot.</p>

  <p>At this time, Lancelot whispered, "Be careful, Desmund. Romeo's very strong. He already killed three members of our race in the past. If you think you can't defeat him, you can directly admit defeat and save yourself."</p>

  <p>A tinge of bitterness was revealed on Desmund's face.</p>

  <p>After all, the person he was going to fight, Romeo, was no ordinary warrior. He had a lot of experience in battling, and some of his opponents might even be stronger than him.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Roy had killed one of Romeo's companions, making him furious.</p>

  <p>Now, Desmund had to face an angry Romeo and survive. 'What a bad luck!' he thought to himself bitterly.</p>

  <p>Romeo gave off his Wild God Power, and the momentum slowly rose.</p>

  <p>His body began to expand, his white robe making a loud noise of cloth being torn. The bamboo sword in his hand also began to expand.</p>

  <p>Facing Desmund of the Yellow Emperor race, Romeo still showed his politeness. Slightly cupping his hands to the other man, he told his opponent indifferently, "Your elders have said that in the battle ring, if one is killed, they only have themselves to blame."</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Desmund blinked his eyes and asked, "Yes. So what?"</p>

  <p>"Then you can only blame yourself..."</p>

  <p>Romeo answered, striking Desmund as soon as he finished speaking.</p>

  <p>He sprang to his feet like a wild ancient beast. Ready to kill.</p>

  <p>His body stretched into tens of thousands of feet. As he jumped above the ground, he waved his bamboo sword in the air, drawing a flash of emerald green light in the air and emitting a resolute aura as he charged towards Desmund.</p>

  <p>When Desmund saw Romeo go all out, he felt cowardly, perhaps because he wasn't prepared for a fierce fight.</p>

  <p>Just like any other battle, a warrior would be put into a passive position when they were intimidated by their opponent.</p>

  <p>Trying to be alert, Desmund turned over to avoid Romeo's strike.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Romeo touched the ground, another emerald green sword light followed him.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Desmund gritted his teeth and took the chance to stab the blade he was holding towards Romeo's chest.</p>

  <p>He was trying to force Romeo to retreat. After all, if Romeo wanted to kill him, he would be stabbed through by the blade too.</p>

  <p>However, Romeo turned a blind eye to the blade. He didn't care about getting stabbed. Even if he had to fight to the death, he would still chop Desmund's head!</p>

  <p>His reaction completely surprised Desmund. 'What? He doesn't seem to care about his life at all!'</p>

  <p>Desmund cried inside. Taking his blade back, he retreated quickly to avoid his opponent's attack. He thought to himself, 'Why did Roy have to kill his opponent? Now the Nine Li members are fuming mad. And I don't think they would stop. This guy literally wants me dead! Damn!'</p>
