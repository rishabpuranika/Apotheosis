<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 482 The Way Evan Came On Stage (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For several years now, ever since he had started practicing Buddhist cultivation method, Patrick had been proud of his emotional stability, more so than his strength.</p>

  <p>As someone who had been an Acalanatha in his previous incarnation, he was more stable than anyone else in the world could be. No matter how serious the problem was, he could have dealt with it calmly. As the old saying goes, the Buddha is in one's heart rather than anywhere else. This essentially meant that taking it easy and remaining calm was the way of the Buddhist method. As an expert practitioner, his heart was always like a lake, placid and still.</p>

  <p>But today was the day of the storm. Today, the lake was not calm as usual. First there were a lot of ripples and then a large wave had come.</p>

  <p>With increasing temperature, it was now nearing an active volcano.</p>

  <p>Patrick felt like he was going to puke blood. How on earth was Luo Luo Zheng doing that?</p>

  <p>The Green Lotus Karma Fire was the very definition of Hell on Earth. It was extremely powerful and had no defense! Patrick didn't need to be told just how dangerous it was.</p>

  <p>He would have felt a lot better if Luo Luo Zheng had merely used some secret weapons or some new move to defend himself from the Green Lotus Karma Fire temporarily, but the problem was that he wasn't afraid of it at all. It was almost as if the flame was nothing to him. And the worst part was that there were even whirlpools around Luo Luo Zheng that pulled the Karma Fire into themselves.</p>

  <p>This was unacceptable for anyone in the world.</p>

  <p>When he was fighting against Tianming, Patrick hadn't really shown his cards. He was keeping them safe because as far as he was concerned, those hidden moves were enough for him to beat Luo Luo Zheng. But even though all of those moves were new, every single one of them had been completely blocked. Most importantly, Patrick hadn't planned to use the Green Lotus Karma Fire in the first place. He'd never expected that Luo Luo Zheng could make him use it.</p>

  <p>The moment he was forced to the edge of the arena by Luo Zheng's sword spirit, Patrick had started thinking of the possibility that maybe Luo Luo Zheng had a way to stand against his Green Lotus Karma Fire.</p>

  <p>His initial assessment was that even if Luo Luo Zheng could do that, it wouldn't last long. The fire was supposed to last a very long time, and while Luo Luo Zheng was busy defending himself from the fire, it would be difficult for him to resist Patrick's other attacks. Patrick was clear about the power of his moves. He knew this one surefire way to make Luo Luo Zheng vulnerable.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had chosen a completely different path. He wasn't defending himself from the fire; he was absorbing it.</p>

  <p>Patrick didn't even have a chance to fight. He was too baffled to do that.</p>

  <p>All he really wanted to do was ask: where had the fire gone?</p>

  <p>It would seem that Luo Zheng's body had absorbed the fire. But that fire was supposed to be lethal to others. Somehow, it seemed beneficial to Luo Luo Zheng. It was something that could refine his body.</p>

  <p>Actually, Luo Luo Zheng had been beaten by Patrick too many times for his fire to have any effect now. The practice had made the warm currents in his body flow through every one of his vessels which was actually very comfortable.</p>

  <p>Now the fire was burning inside him and he felt that he was becoming stronger and stronger instead of feeling a sense of burning. The scalding hot flow inside him didn't make him feel ill, but warm and comfortable instead.</p>

  <p>It could be compared to a blacksmith making weapons. First, he needed to melt it, then beat it, and finally, temper it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been going through this process since the time his body was refined to the level of a mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>The golden whirlpools around him were absorbing the Green Lotus Karma Fire faster and faster. The fire didn't spread much far since it was trapped in the arena because of the runes on the floor. This apparent concentration made the situation seem worse.</p>

  <p>Initially, the Karma Fire had risen high in the sky and seemed to burn more and more furiously.</p>

  <p>But as Luo Luo Zheng kept absorbing it constantly, it gradually slowed down and became smaller by the second. Now Yan and some sharp-eyed people could finally see the two men fighting in the arena.</p>

  <p>As time went by, the Green Lotus Karma Fire became smaller and smaller. The initially dense blaze now looked like small, red, furious clouds scattered in the arena's air and they kept on being absorbed by Luo Zheng's whirlpools at a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>Finally the last bit of fire was gone. The whole arena was clear again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expressions became pleased and happy as a new spiritual texture appeared on his chest due to Patrick's Green Lotus Karma Fire. Now he had three of them which meant that his body had been refined to a top-grade spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>Another such symbol and his body would probably become a fairy weapon! He wondered what that would be like!</p>

  <p>After he saw everything that had happened, Patrick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Let's stop!" he said curtly, deciding to give up the fight. Although there were several moves that he hadn't used yet, but if Luo Luo Zheng had blocked the Green Lotus Karma Fire, Patrick didn't think it would make any difference or indeed, much sense, if he went on fighting.</p>

  <p>He actually felt unlucky to have Luo Luo Zheng as his rival.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had also defeated Tianming earlier on in the competition, but Tianming hadn't lost as badly as Patrick, who was supposed to be better than him.</p>

  <p>An important reason for this was that Luo Luo Zheng had defeated, absorbed, or defended all of Patrick's deadliest moves without flinching.</p>
