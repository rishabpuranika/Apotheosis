<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1775 An Abnormal Phenomenon </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"You. Where have you been?" Luo Zheng was dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>The two of them were at the Spirit Supreme Realm, and they were both Godly Geniuses. Even Spirit Transformation Realm warriors were no match for them. No one in the Central Region could have been able to do anything to them.</p>

  <p>Lawson let out a cold snort, resignedly sitting down, legs crossed to recuperate. If it was any other martial artist who had suffered such an injury, that would be the end of things. But these Godly Geniuses often carried around holy pills with them.</p>

  <p>Nathan told Luo Zheng the story. "What kind of damned place is this great world? The further north we went, the stronger the storm was. We could've died inside."</p>

  <p>"I guess they don't call it the Chaotic Ocean of Stars for nothing." The root cause of their injuries started to come to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, there had been an extremely strong storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars but Luo Zheng had never known the cause of it. All he knew was that the storm was dangerous so he had never dared to approach the core of the storm. Even now, he was afraid that he would not be able to weather it.</p>

  <p>The two of them had been so faithful in their own powers and strength and upon seeing such a wondrous scene in the Lower World, they could not help but venture in to explore.</p>

  <p>They couldn't have imagined that the further in they went, the more terrifying the wind blades would become. Some wind blades even contained the eighth or ninth layer of the Wind Law. It was equivalent to a full force attack from a world lord. How could these two withstand it?</p>

  <p>Lawson had even used a defensive treasure passed down to him by the Lie Clan so he could escape. He lamented that he had used such a great treasure, only to leave with such wounds all over his body.</p>

  <p>Over the past few days, many people in the Central Region had asked to visit Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There had been people from the World Commercial Alliance, the Ethereal Spirit Sect and even many from the Cloud Hall, but Luo Zheng refused them all.</p>

  <p>He hadn't wanted to meet with anyone till he knew Ning Yudie was back safely.</p>

  <p>On the fourteenth day, there was still no signs of Ning Yudie ever coming back to the great world.</p>

  <p>The fifteenth day seemed like any other.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed since Luo Zheng returned to the Cloud Hall to wait for Ning Yudie to return.</p>

  <p>He was getting more and more agitated.</p>

  <p>He regretted that the anxiety had taken over him when he was in the Celestial Position. He should have asked Master Feng to follow them through the ascending passageway, rather than wait at the other end.</p>

  <p>Worried as he was, he began to get suspicious of what was to come. He knew the people in the Upper World had kept a lot of important information from him. Even Xun had seemed indifferent to him. At this point, Luo Zheng had come to rely on himself for any solution as he knew there was no one else who could help.</p>

  <p>If Ning Yudie had indeed been intercepted by the sorcerers, he would have been waiting all this time in vain.</p>

  <p>On the sixteenth day after Zheng's return, on the Divine Kingdom Continent, the York Divine Kingdom was holding a grand celebration.</p>

  <p>A new ruler was coming to the throne as his predecessor had already ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>All the martial artists and common citizens of the York Divine Kingdom had come together for the ceremony.</p>

  <p>The ascending passageway of the great world was constantly changing its place. When there was a martial artist who was about to ascend, the ascending passageway would move to where the marital artist was.</p>

  <p>Half a year ago, when Ning Yudie was going to ascend from the Central Region, it had moved to the place above the Central Region, near the Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>And three days ago, the former ruler of the York Divine Kingdom ascended to the Upper World, and the ascending passageway had moved to the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>The new emperor of the York Divine Kingdom was only at the sixth level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>With the ascending passageway being repaired, the Soul Sea Realm martial artists in the divine kingdoms all ascended to the Upper World and with that, the four divine kingdoms' strength had been weakened. All the current rulers were only at the Life and Death Realm and once they reached the Soul Sea Realm, they would be forcibly driven into the ascending passageway by the great world.</p>

  <p>As the ruler of the York Divine Kingdom prepared to ascend the throne, a violent phenomenon suddenly appeared in the sky. A large crack extended along the clouds, as if a hidden monster had opened its mouth!</p>

  <p>Many small black dots suddenly appeared in the crack!</p>

  <p>They fell to the ground at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>"It's an abnormal phenomenon!"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty, this abnormal phenomenon is a good sign for you to ascend to the throne."</p>

  <p>"This is a good omen!"</p>

  <p>"All of you, shut up!" The ruler of the York Divine Kingdom, Brennan Liu gazed at those black spots, and then his complexion suddenly changed. He recognized the black spots were actually many martial artists!</p>

  <p>Brennan Liu could not clearly see the cultivation levels of these people from this distance, but why were they falling from the sky? These did not seem like friendly people; so how could it be a good omen?</p>

  <p>Soon, some of the weaker warriors also made it out that the black dots were people that were descending at a rapid speed!</p>

  <p>Brennan Liu spotted the warrior in the lead.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be sporting a serious injury. His body was dripping with blood and his Mu Ning was starting to falter.</p>

  <p>Even so, his Mu Ning still showed the strength of someone who could easily overpower Brennan. It was unfathomable. This being only needed to lift a finger and he could kill Brennan.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors that followed him, sure, they seemed a little weaker but they were undoubtedly warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, and there were at least a thousand of them.</p>

  <p>Even with their eyes closed, this army would be able to annihilate all four divine kingdoms!</p>

  <p>After all, they were from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Brennan Liu had a thought.</p>

  <p>But what were they doing here? What had brought them to the Lower World?</p>

  <p>'This does not look right. Some of them are injured, many severely so.</p>

  <p>Maybe they're escaping something.' Brennan Liu was quick in his thinking and it wasn't long before he saw through to the crux of the matter.</p>

  <p>The man at the helm of the army was unfathomably powerful and he had brought a sea of warriors of the Soul Sea Realm with him.</p>

  <p>So the only question remained: who was chasing them?</p>

  <p>If he and his people got involved, not only the York Divine Kingdom but the entire Divine Kingdom Continent and even the entire great world would be in for a ride of misfortune.</p>

  <p>"Who thought this could be a good omen?"</p>

  <p>As Brennan Liu reprimanded angrily, the civil and military officials who had gathered for the enthronement ceremony completely silenced.</p>

  <p>Brennan Liu tossed aside the golden crown on his head and flew towards the sky. He knew that if he did not succeed in handling this situation, he wouldn't be able to keep his life, no less, his throne. Besides, he had never taken the throne seriously. He had already reached the sixth level of the Life and Death Realm and he would soon break through to the Soul Sea Realm. Then, he would ascend to the Upper World like his father and grandfather had done before him. This was just how it was, the rulers of the four divine kingdoms succeeding each other as each generation was ready. After the ascending passageway was repaired, the rulers of the four divine kingdoms had changed very frequently.</p>

  <p>True, the ruler of a divine kingdom probably had not changed for a few thousand years in the past. But now they could ascend to the Upper World and many emperors had chosen to abandon their kingdoms and soar into the Upper World less than two years after they took their thrones.</p>
