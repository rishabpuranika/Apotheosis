<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the four Other Shore creatures were killed, four blood dots simultaneously appeared within the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>The moment those dots formed, the Other Shore creatures standing under the painting felt a sense of cautiousness creep under their skin.</p>

  <p>They all knew that once a dot appeared, it could only mean that someone had died. However, they couldn't discern who it was or which race it came from.</p>

  <p>With the forming of the dots came an uneasy sense of foreboding. It had been less than four hours since the warriors had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, and a death rarely ever occurred on the first page.</p>

  <p>As everyone stared at the dots intently, a sudden ray of blood light erupted from each one.</p>

  <p>Woosh! Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!</p>

  <p>They all watched as the four beams of light headed to the north, illuminating four Three Purities Stones.</p>

  <p>Standing beside the stones were members of the Dull Blood race.</p>

  <p>The Dull Blood race was well known within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. Their expressions darkened when they realized what the rays of blood light meant.</p>

  <p>Those warriors that had died were incredibly talented, all trained by the Dull Blood race. It was nearly incomprehensible that they had died in less than four hours after entering the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"What on earth could have happened in the Eternal Scroll Painting?"</p>

  <p>"They should be on the first page. Why?"</p>

  <p>Their questions went unanswered.</p>

  <p>Those of the Dull Blood race were struggling with the feelings of sadness and puzzlement while the other races of the Other Shore felt a keen sense of relief. It didn't matter what happened in the Eternal Scroll Painting as long as the dead were not of their own race.</p>

  <p>An overwhelming amount of Worm Tapirs had been released into the Eternal Scroll Painting though, so how could the other Other Shore creatures be spared the same fate?</p>

  <p>It was not long after the first four deaths that two more blood dots marred the surface of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>As they watched the circles form, their hearts rose to their throats, choking them.</p>

  <p>"What is going on in there?"</p>

  <p>"Since when was the first page of the Eternal Scroll Painting this dangerous?"</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it! Another two people have died..."</p>

  <p>They all watched with bated breath as the rays of light fell over another race on the Other Shore. Each face of the Other Shore race turned sullen.</p>

  <p>"It had to be an accident!"</p>

  <p>"Dying on the first page may be rare, but it has happened throughout history..."</p>

  <p>"They're just unlucky. That's all!"</p>

  <p>Throughout history, very few had died on the first page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. And if anyone happened to die then, it was maybe one or two.</p>

  <p>However, this time was proving to be incredibly different.</p>

  <p>As they watched the painting with rapt attention, dozens of blood dots began to rapidly appear. Most of the Other Shore creatures thought that this must be a mistake.</p>

  <p>After realizing it was not a hoax, the entire bronze ground fell into a deafening silence.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures looked up to the sky with impossibly wide eyes, their mouths flapping open and closed as if trying to speak but no sound came out. This occurrence was so unexpected and crazy that no one knew what to think or say. Something terrible had happened on the first page.</p>

  <p>The newly formed blood dots hummed softly. dozens of rays of blood light burst from the newly formed dots in haphazard patterns. When a beam of light touched a Three Purities Stone, they all knew it meant that the Other Shore creature represented by the stone had died.</p>

  <p>There was an odd sound of disbelief that echoed through the silence. "How could this be?" Pearce asked, his voice wobbly with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Will Zheng be all right?" Auden asked in a much calmer tone.</p>

  <p>"Look! A ray of blood light is coming!" Libby suddenly pointed to the sky.</p>

  <p>The beam of light from the Eternal Scroll Painting was barreling towards them. As they watched the light, the hearts of those of the Oneness Sky Palace skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>They could hear the humming of the ray as if a swarm of insects were hovering around their heads.</p>

  <p>At the last second, the light deviated slightly and landed on a Three Purities Stone not too far away from them. That particular stone represented a member of the Violet Cloud race.</p>

  <p>When they realized the light was not for Zheng, the Oneness Sky Palace breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>The death had not been Zheng.</p>

  <p>Opposite of the Oneness Sky Palace's relief, the members of the Violet Cloud race felt heavy with their comrade's death.</p>

  <p>There had been six from the Violet Cloud race to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. Aside from Walden, the dead member was another who had been most likely to enter the Eternal Realm. Their sadness for the member was almost all consuming.</p>

  <p>Once the rays of light had found their stones, the creatures of the Other Shore returned their gazes to the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>So many had perished in a single breath on the first page, so they could only assume the remaining creatures were having just as difficult of a time.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, their thoughts were proven correct.</p>

  <p>After a brief reprieve, nearly a hundred blood dots began to litter the painting.</p>

  <p>When the blood light began to fall from the dots, a brilliant flash of white light burst across the bronze ground in the distance.</p>

  <p>When the relief sculptures on the bronze ground were renewed again, the Other Shore creatures shifted their gazes to the Three Purities Stones of the warriors who had had their lives taken.</p>

  <p>The bodies that were anchored to these Three Purities Stones had been torn to shreds and scattered all over the ground.</p>

  <p>Despite the Eternal Scroll Painting already being disfigured by a bloody storm, the Other Shore creatures still within it were calm.</p>

  <p>The canvas of the painting was immense, and because the Other Shore creatures within it had turned into pictures on the Eternal Scroll Painting, their vision was quite limited. They could only see a bit far ahead of them, so they had no idea how many had actually met their end.</p>

  <p>Zheng found himself at a relatively remote position, so he was able to avoid the Worm Tapirs with relative ease.</p>

  <p>As he glanced around for the beasts though, he paused and felt an odd sense of confusion fill him. The ground before him was covered in black.</p>

  <p>He thought that it might be a beast curling up on the ground. With a pleased grin, he charged forward only to discover what he saw was not a beast, but a torn "picture" and the space was pooled with blood.</p>

  <p>"This must have been an Other Shore creature. How could he have been torn apart like this?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly surprised. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, didn't you say that there would be no danger on the first page?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked just as surprised as Zheng was. He thought for a moment before speaking, "Perhaps it is an exceptional case.</p>

  <p>Some of the Other Shore creatures are quite weak."</p>

  <p>"Everyone here has achieved a Myriad Tribulations Body though. How could such an Other Shore creature lose to a beast in the scroll painting?"</p>

  <p>Zheng questioned, doubting what had been said.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't help but agree.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps some beasts that shouldn't appear on the first page have appeared.</p>

  <p>It's a very small chance that it happens, but still possible."</p>

  <p>If that were true, then Zheng would need to be careful.</p>

  <p>While the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zheng were analyzing the situation, three Other Shore creatures suddenly rushed over from afar. They had been able to kill a beast before Zheng earlier.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at them a little closer, and realized they were screaming for help as they ran from something.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven noticed what was chasing them before Zheng did.</p>

  <p>"It's a Worm Tapir! On the first page? Zheng, run!" he called to Zheng in warning.</p>

  <p>"A Worm Tapir?"</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated, but he could hear the urgency in the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice.</p>

  <p>He could see a black silhouette appear and disappear behind the Other Shore creatures, as if it were riding waves.</p>

  <p>It was moving incredibly fast, taking no time at all to reach the three Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>When the black silhouette crashed over the top of them, they were ripped apart at the middle. Their blood spurted out in all directions creating a grotesque, abstract image.</p>
