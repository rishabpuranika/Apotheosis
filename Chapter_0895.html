<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the topmost floor of the Tower of Sin, the many ogre top-level war lords had gathered in the No. 2 space, all wearing depressed looks on their faces.</p>

  <p>Although many of the ogre war lords were still lining up to challenge Luo Zheng on the eleventh floor, they clearly knew in their hearts that it was simply a futile struggle.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng had been a mere war general, he had already been able to easily defeat Boris. Now that Luo Zheng had become a second level war general, he was no longer afraid of facing ordinary war lords.</p>

  <p>The most important thing was that Luo Zheng was not a fool.</p>

  <p>So what if they managed to defeat him in the arena? He could still use the power of the Tower of Sin to kill anyone he wanted…</p>

  <p>Rules were nothing in the eyes of those who held power. They were only used to control weak warriors.</p>

  <p>Did they honestly expect Luo Zheng to obey their rules? That was impossible!</p>

  <p>These top-level war lords were also well aware of this.</p>

  <p>Many of the ogre war lords had already realized that their days were numbered in the Tower of Sin, and many of the top-level war lords had started to clean up their mess and prepared to return home.</p>

  <p>"We still have one last chance," Maurice suddenly said. "Who's willing to stay?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to continue fighting desperately against Luo Zheng?" a top-level war lord asked in a disgruntled tone.</p>

  <p>Maurice stared coldly at the top-level war lord who had asked this.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the brains of his comrades were addled.</p>

  <p>Another top-level war lord said, "Yes, there is indeed a final chance!"</p>

  <p>Maurice laughed heartily. "Moreover, there is a good chance of winning."</p>

  <p>More and more war lords came to realize what they were talking about, and their eyes flashed with rekindled hope.</p>

  <p>Yes, in less than half a month, Luo Zheng would begin to drive the many ogres out from the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>In the past, they had hid two war sages in the secret passageway below the Tower of Sin, and while hiding in that place, they could easily avoid the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>When the Dark Nether Death Light in the Dark Nether Cave had weakened, it was highly likely that Luo Zheng would enter the Dark Nether Cave to explore.</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't go there this year, he would go next year as well. Or if it was not next year, he would certainly go the year after that!</p>

  <p>The life span of a top-level war lord was very long and they didn't mind waiting for a few years!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they could still continue to cultivate in the secret passageway!</p>

  <p>There were many top-level war lords present, such as Maurice and certain others, who had been suppressing their cultivation levels to prevent themselves from breaking through to become war sages and then being killed by the spell of the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>If they chose to hide away in the secret passageway, and cultivate until they could break through and become war sages, then they could wait for Luo Zheng to enter the Dark Nether Cave and kill him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was undeniably a talent, and the strength which he had unleashed was very powerful. However, he was only powerful when compared to the ordinary war lords. For these top-level war lords, he was still nothing of importance. Moreover, it wouldn't be long before these top-level war lords would break through to become war sages if they hid in the secret passageway.</p>

  <p>Inside the Dark Nether Cave, Luo Zheng would be unable to use the power of the Tower of Sin to kill anyone. Therefore, it would not be difficult for them to then kill Luo Zheng there!</p>

  <p>"Now let's make a plan. It's a fact that we can't take the Purple Heart Sacred Place down. Half a month from now, every one of us will have to give up the Tower of Sin." Maurice continued, "I've already suppressed my cultivation level for many years, so it won't be difficult for me to break through and become a war sage. Who else wants to go with me to make a break through?"</p>

  <p>"Count me in!" one of the top-level war lords said in a muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"I'll join!"</p>

  <p>"I can also make the breakthrough in a short amount of time!"</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, most of the top-level war lords had suppressed their cultivation level. After all, they had improved much faster while in the Tower of Sin than they would have on the outside. Once they left the Tower of Sin, they would never have the chance to return again.</p>

  <p>The advantage of suppressing one's cultivation level was obvious. The more one suppressed his cultivation, the faster his cultivation level would rise after breaking through to become a war sage. It was much like a spring: the more it was suppressed, the more forcefully it would bubble up.</p>

  <p>Maurice glanced them over before saying, "Boyd, Rehaan, the two of you will stay."</p>

  <p>Boyd and Rehaan ranked 18th and 22nd respectively among the seat holders.</p>

  <p>However, it would be impossible for Maurice to stay currently. He was the leader of the ogre race in the Tower of Sin, and it would cause suspicion if he didn't show up and lead the ogres out of the Tower of Sin when the time came.</p>

  <p>Maurice's eyes glinted with hope. He stared at Boyd and Rehaan and said,</p>

  <p>"Whether we, the ogre race, can ever return to the Tower of Sin will all depend on you two!"</p>

  <p>A dense malicious Mu Ning suddenly emitted from the faces of these two top-level war lords. "Don't worry. As long as that kid dares to enter the Dark Nether Cave, we will definitely tear him into pieces!"</p>

  <p>Half a month passed in the blinking of an eye.</p>

  <p>The entire Sea God Continent was immersed in a strangely tense atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Although the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had declared war on the Purple Heart Sacred Place, they had never initiated fighting, and the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had also not taken any real action. The battle lines were drawn, but remained uncrossed. It was a cold war, a stalemate.</p>

  <p>After the one-month time limit that Luo Zheng had given Maurice was up, the armies of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place retreated. At the same time, Amber also retreated back to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, the ogres began to leave the place, one after another.</p>

  <p>The ogre race had relied heavily on the Tower of Sin to flourish, and in their heyday, they even controlled the entire Tower of Sin with their own powers.</p>

  <p>But now, they had no choice but to leave. They had been masters, but were now evicted!</p>

  <p>"That human kid really worked a miracle. He drove the entire ogre race out of the Tower of Sin with just his own strength!"</p>

  <p>"Why do I suddenly feel like pitying the ogres somewhat?"</p>

  <p>"Pity? If you had ever been oppressed by the ogres back in the day, then you would have understood that it is nobody's fault but their own, to have come to this point!"</p>

  <p>On that day, many warriors from the Tower of Sin gathered and stood at the doorway, watching the ogres' retreat.</p>

  <p>Ogre war fighters, war generals, and even many of the top-level war lords left the Tower of Sin one by one. Even though they were reluctant to leave, they didn't have any other choice right now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already proclaimed that from tomorrow onward, he would kill any ogre that he saw in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>In this situation, if the ogres continued to stay in the Tower of Sin, they would only be courting a certain death.</p>

  <p>The ogre multitudes formed a thin, meandering line and headed towards the north of the Cursed Land. There were two transmission arrays leading respectively to the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Most of the ogres had left with great disappointment, hatred, and indignation, refusing to accept such a cruel fate.</p>

  <p>They couldn't understand how such a powerful race had fallen at the hands of a little kid and for no reason?</p>

  <p>Only a very small number of top-level war lords knew that they would return sooner or later to the Tower of Sin. The war lords were down, but not out.</p>

  <p>All this depended on when Luo Zheng would enter the Dark Nether Cave. As long as Luo Zheng died, the ogres would be able to return to the Tower of Sin and retrieve their seats on the top floor and regain control of the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>Standing on the platform at the ground floor of the Tower of Sin, Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts, his eyes as calm as still water.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, the Lucky Light which Luo Zheng had absorbed was at least a hundred times more than what he had obtained before. Within the half a month, there were at least three to four ogre war lords coming to challenge him on a daily basis. With the high-intensity training and the accumulation of a large amount of Lucky Light, Zheng's cultivation had rapidly increased. The Tower of Sin was indeed a wonderful place for cultivation. Luo Zheng was now a sixth level war general!</p>

  <p>According to the information he had received, the Dark Nether Death Light inside the Dark Nether Cave would weaken within three to four months.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng had plenty of time left to improve himself.</p>

  <p>To Zheng's knowledge, there was a period of time every year when the Dark Nether Death Light would weaken. However, this time was not fixed or predetermined. Sometimes it would be one month earlier, and sometimes it would even be one month later than expected.</p>

  <p>However, once it was activated in this period, the light would not inflict any damage in the first month.</p>

  <p>'I am determined to retrieve that inheritance from inside the Dark Nether Cave! Then, I believe, it won't be long before I can return to the Central Region…'</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Zheng's eyes narrowed with pleasure. However, as he looked around, he suddenly saw Maurice, who was heading off into the distance, turn his head and give him a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart tightened when he saw Maurice's smile, and he frowned suspiciously.</p>

  <p>'It would seem that the ogre race will not give up easily, ' Luo Zheng thought in his heart.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Zheng began to sink. In a flash, his entire body had already been merged into the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>As the entire Tower of Sin was stuck upside down in the Cursed Land, Luo Zheng was actually standing on the first floor of the Tower of Sin. After his body had merged with the Tower of Sin, he continuously spiraled downward.</p>

  <p>He traveled through the first floor, the second floor… the tenth floor, the fourteenth floor, and fifteenth floor...</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng arrived at the very top of the tower!</p>

  <p>Nothing else really mattered to him now. Default victory or qualifications to be promoted to the next level all became meaningless to Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>Even the ogres had already been driven out and banished by him. He no longer needed to care about the rules of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Standing in the center of the hall on the fifteenth floor, Luo Zheng suddenly said calmly, "All of the seat holders, please come forth! It's time to make some new rules."</p>
