  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled slightly and remained silent when he heard Frank.</p>

  <p>In comparison to Zheng's indifference, Tianming looked rather angry and said, "Gosh! This guy is too cocky!"</p>

  <p>"If Frank says you're in his way, then you are in his way. If you want to survive on Death Road, you'd better do as told!" Lois, Frank's fiancee, warned Tianming when she heard what he said.</p>

  <p>Tianming pouted and wanted to retort, but Zheng stopped him. He then heard Zheng say, "Forget it, Tianming! Since Frank is so confident of his strength, we're happy to watch him defeat the Flying Yaksha alone."</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Tianming were at the nature level, and before showing their real strength, they did look like weaker that of any average disciple from the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, sometimes, being underestimated by others was not a bad thing, especially on the Death Road, a dangerous area. Since Frank was willing to be the hero and block the attacks of the golden Flying Yaksha himself, it would be advantageous for Zheng and Tianming as they wouldn't have to fight. They could simply watch him.</p>

  <p>Lewis, who was standing next to Zheng, did not speak. Although he had outstanding strength, Lewis was not very bold. Otherwise, he would not have given up the treasure box in the second tier so easily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, right! We need to check if Patrick is all right first. He has been attacked by the Flying Yaksha thrice. I'm worried he might have been hurt," said Zheng. Concerned, he hurriedly walked to the edge of the big pit in search of Patrick.</p>

  <p>By the time they reached the edge, Patrick had climbed up. The golden light protecting him was slowly fading away. Although he did not appear to have been badly hurt, he looked a mess and was covered with dirt.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his breath seemed a little weaker.</p>

  <p>"Patrick, are you all right?" Zheng asked, genuinely worried.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Tianming! You guys are here, too!" At the sight of his two companions, Patrick exclaimed excitedly. Joy reflected in his expression.</p>

  <p>Unlike Frank, Patrick knew clearly about the strength of Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Zheng was much stronger than him, a fact that had been confirmed during the All Peaks Competition, while during his battle with Tianming, Patrick found that Tianming was only a little weaker than him.</p>

  <p>The Death Road was full of deadly traps, and if Zheng and Tianming were to join him, it would definitely be advantageous to him.</p>

  <p>Patrick's injury was not serious. Yet, the problem was that to fight against the Flying Yaksha, he had used the power of the Acalanatha. As a result, for the next few days, he could not be able to use it. Since he had temporarily lost this ability, Patrick's combat effectiveness was significantly weakened.</p>

  <p>As they spoke, Frank engaged in a fierce fight with the golden Flying Yaksha!</p>

  <p>Of course, the Flying Yaksha was extremely strong, and the corporeal body of this kind of fierce beast was quite appalling. However, Frank's spear was also extremely sharp!</p>

  <p>The so-called "horizontal saber, vertical sword, piercing spear" referred to the following three arguments: the saber was usually used to chop, and the momentum of a saber could be powerful; the sword had the ability to cut and pierce, while the spear's attack mode was relatively single, focusing on piercing only.</p>

  <p>As the spear was used to penetrate only, its piercing function was the strongest among the three kinds of weapons.</p>

  <p>Together, with Frank's spear intent of consummate grade, the spear attacks launched by Frank could perforate any object within his attacking space.</p>

  <p>But, after the Flying Yaksha transformed, a layer of extremely hard gold scales appeared around its body as a defense against any attack!</p>

  <p>Earlier, Frank had been able to break through the Flying Yaksha's defenses, but now when Frank's white spear collided with the gold scales of the Flying Yaksha, it was blocked. The attacks were only able to leave several tiny marks on its surface.</p>

  <p>"Howl," the Flying Yaksha emitted a roar.</p>

  <p>This time, it relied on its strong corporeal body, so it pounced on Frank recklessly.</p>

  <p>Frank, on the other hand, continued to retreat from its violent attacks with his dexterous body moving skills.</p>

  <p>"We are really… going to watch him and not offer any help?" Tianming asked anxiously. When he saw that Frank was retreating continuously and seemed to be in great danger, a hint of worry appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Although Frank was annoying, he was really powerful. If they wanted to get out of the Death Road successfully, they knew that they must unite.</p>

  <p>Thus, Tianming found it hard to stand still and watch the Flying Yaksha kill Frank.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, shook his head and said calmly, "His fiancee, Lois, isn't offering him any help, which indicates that Frank has reserved his strength. Otherwise, Lois would be more worried than us."</p>

  <p>Tianming then saw that Lois was standing calmly not far from them. Her arms were wrapping around her chest as she watched Frank. The expression on her face reflected that she had great confidence in him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's speculation was correct. Lois did believe that Frank could beat the Flying Yaksha and trusted her fiance's strength absolutely.</p>

  <p>Frank was a little embarrassed after being pushed back over 100 feet by the Flying Yaksha. But, a calm expression remained on his handsome face. If one looked carefully, they would see a small smile on Frank's lips.</p>

  <p>If he kept retreating, Frank would be driven into a dead-end corner with a boulder about twenty feet high. Then, the onlookers noticed Frank sneering before stepping closer to the boulder and kicking it. The force with which Frank kicked the boulder was so tremendous that it left a deep pit in the boulder.</p>

  <p>With the force of the kick, somehow, Frank's body maintained a straight line with his spear and began to spin fast.</p>

  <p>As Frank's body spun, a whirling vortex formed at the tip of his white spear. It continuously absorbed the spear intent and created a highly condensed strong energy!</p>

  <p>As the strong energy was not condensed with life vitality, but with the spear intent of consummate grade, the power it contained was beyond imaginable.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that the spear intent could be used in this way," Zheng said in surprise. He then exchanged a glance with Tianming. The expression on their faces showed that they had been enlightened.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng and Tianming had figured out the sword intent of the consummate grade, they had not tried to condense sword intent to that extreme extent. This was for several reasons, including the fact that their knowledge about sword intent was limited.</p>
