  <p>
</p>

  <p>The souls, the Godly Ways, and the strength could be refined to consummation, which was the limit of True Gods' power.</p>

  <p>Once a True God had cultivated Nine Divine Stars, they could continue to accumulate the strength source. The soul, on the contrary, was hard to make progress on after one achieved the Soul of Light. The Godly Ways were standards to figure out whether or not one had become a consummate True God. If one wanted to become stronger after breaking through, their only hope would be the theurgies beyond the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The blood energy, however, could be infinitely absorbed. The bodies of consummate True Gods were exceptionally strong, and the blood energy they contained was far stronger than that of ordinary True Gods. But it was very difficult to recover their bodies using only their own blood energy.</p>

  <p>For example, Rachelle paid a high price when she had to repair her wounds by taking the seven times refined pill.</p>

  <p>The True Gods could heal quickly without using pills, if their blood energy was strong enough.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the consummate True Gods often scrambled for pills and methods to strengthen their blood energy. Several of them stood up one after another, intending to kill the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>The turtles' shells could send back all attacks in ricochets but it was not a big deal for the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Zheng had also noticed the blood energy.</p>

  <p>He had swallowed a Nine-head Snake Blood Pill in the fairy palace that had greatly increased his blood energy.</p>

  <p>However, his corporeal body was far stronger than those of the True Gods of the same level. He had been a low-rank True God, but his blood energy was still not enough.</p>

  <p>As a vast majority of the True Gods did not intend to make a move, Zheng turned and began walking towards the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>In no time, the first Golden Shell Turtle had found Zheng and rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>But since it carried a heavy shell on its back, it was achingly slow even at its full speed.</p>

  <p>Threads of strength sources condensed before Zheng's body and formed the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>It then thrust towards the head of the Golden Shell Turtle.</p>

  <p>Watching the invisible Buddha Emperor Sword approaching it fiercely, the turtle retracted its head into the shell.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword crashed onto the shell of the turtle, leaving a fist-sized crack.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't use his full strength. It was obviously impossible for him to kill a Golden Shell Turtle with a single move like a consummate True God. But according to Zheng's estimation, he could kill it with a few more strikes.</p>

  <p>As soon as his sword hit the turtle, a curtain of white light appeared on its shell, from which an invisible sword shadow shot out towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword had only gathered thirty five percent of the strength source, but it was still a threat to Zheng. If the sword were to hit Zheng, he would at least be seriously injured, if not dead.</p>

  <p>In his desperation, Zheng had no choice but to raise the Grant Sun Sword to protect himself.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a dull sound, the two swords bumped into each other and vanished at the same time.</p>

  <p>"The brat earned a great deal in the last round of killing the Soul-killing Ghosts. But he is still greedy."</p>

  <p>"He was lucky enough to kill the Soul-killing Ghosts. I don't know what kind of secret skills he used then, but these Golden Shell Turtles are not easy to deal with!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed! It's humiliating to fight like this!"</p>

  <p>Some True Gods thought Zheng was making a fool of himself.</p>

  <p>But they had forgotten that the first targets of the Soul-killing Ghosts were the True Gods, and then the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>If Zheng didn't kill the Soul-killing Ghosts, they would ultimately climb up the tree stump. And then, apart from a few top-rank True Gods who could escape by flying into the air, all other True Gods would probably die.</p>

  <p>Seen from this perspective, Zheng had saved most of the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Some of the consummate True Gods who hadn't joined in the fight also stared at Zheng with great interest.</p>

  <p>They were eager to see how Zheng would deal with the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>The Golden Shell Turtle popped its head out and suddenly lunged towards Zheng, intending to bite him.</p>

  <p>Zheng gently twisted his body and dodged this bite easily.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on his face as he brandished an invisible Buddha Emperor Sword once again.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword was still unable to cut off the Golden Shell Turtle's head, and hit the shell again.</p>

  <p>The crack on the shell expanded.</p>

  <p>A white light flashed and an invisible sword shadow shot out of the light curtain.</p>

  <p>At this, Zheng suddenly stretched out a hand.</p>

  <p>"The Parting Water Divine Mirror!"</p>

  <p>At his words, a transparent water curtain appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>When he challenged Yilia, who was ranked one hundred and ninety-sixth in the Arena of Legends, he absorbed her Parting Water Godly Way. He also took away her theurgy beyond the Parting Water Godly Way, namely the Parting Water Divine Mirror.</p>

  <p>The Parting Water Divine Mirror and the shell of the turtle were similar.</p>

  <p>They both could cause the enemy's attack to ricochet back at them.</p>

  <p>There was a big difference between the two, despite their similar power.</p>

  <p>The shell of the Golden Shell Turtle produced the same damage once it took in the opponent's attack, and then sent it back. It was a rare theurgy that belonged to the Golden Shell Turtle.</p>

  <p>When Rachelle chopped the turtle shells with blade lights a while ago, the same blade lights appeared and shot back to her.</p>

  <p>But the Parting Water Divine Mirror was different. While the turtle shell copied the attacks it received, the mirror only reflected the attacks.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Buddha Emperor Sword didn't disappear after it reached the turtle shell. Instead, a second Buddha Emperor Sword shot out of the turtle shell. Once the Parting Water Divine Mirror sent the second sword back, Zheng was actually able to control it.</p>

  <p>This meant that Zheng had a second Buddha Emperor Sword without using his own strength source.</p>

  <p>"Two Buddha Emperor Swords!" Zheng's eyes lit up as he became aware of something.</p>

  <p>He controlled his two swords to attack the Golden Shell Turtle again.</p>

  <p>This time, two fist-sized cracks appeared on two sides of the turtle shell.</p>

  <p>Once the white light flashed on the shell, two more Buddha Emperor Swords appeared from there.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng reflected the two swords by the Parting Water Divine Mirror, he was able to control them.</p>

  <p>And then, Zheng repeated this move several times.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword in front of him multiplied from one into two, two into four, four into eight, eight into sixteen after a few copies.</p>

  <p>Walton, who was resting at the foot of the Goddess Statue, was still a little confused when he saw this scene, but a while later, his eyes opened wide in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Shahn!" Walton shouted. "It's strange. The Parting Water Divine Mirror is a unique theurgy beyond way of your clan, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Reminded by Walton, Shahn turned his attention to Zheng.</p>

  <p>At first, he hadn't figured out what had happened. He had only noticed that Zheng had the strength source by his side. But he was stunned when he finally saw it clearly.</p>

  <p>"He's using the Parting Water Divine Mirror. Where did he learn it? I didn't expect it to work in this way!" Shahn said, having got a nasty shock on seeing this.</p>

  <p>By then, Zheng had thrown sixteen swords onto the shell of the Golden Shell Turtle at a time. The shell exploded, and the turtle died, giving off a glimmer of blood energy that was absorbed by Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The broken shell shone with a white light, and sixteen Buddha Emperor Swords appeared from the light curtain, shooting towards him.</p>

  <p>Zheng once again employed the Parting Water Divine Mirror to reflect them one by one. He then controlled the sixteen swords.</p>

  <p>He was now controlling thirty-two Buddha Emperor Swords.</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked at the swords thickly dotted in front of him.</p>

  <p>There were thirty-two Buddha Emperor Swords in all. If Zheng used them to attack a target, even a top-rank True God would be beaten to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Once again!"</p>

  <p>Zheng gently waved his left hand and controlled sixteen Buddha Emperor Swords to attack a Golden Shell Turtle on the other side. He then waved his right hand, and the other sixteen Buddha Emperor Swords also shot out.</p>

  <p>As the two Golden Shell Turtles were immediately killed by the thirty-two Buddha Emperor Swords, another thirty-two swords bounced back from their shells towards Zheng. Zheng took them under control after the Parting Water Divine Mirror had reflected them.</p>

  <p>By now, Zheng had already controlled sixty-four Buddha Emperor Swords.</p>

  <p>The swords gathered together, releasing the unique power of the strength source. Many of the consummate True Gods could feel the great pressure.</p>
