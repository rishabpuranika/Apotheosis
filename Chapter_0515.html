<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 515 Challenging Luo Luo Zheng (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>A slight frown formed in Luo Zheng's face, and he didn't immediately reply.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, he was feeling somewhat helpless.</p>

  <p>How could he not see through Ray's tricks?</p>

  <p>It was apparent that supporting a proposal for a competition was meant to test Luo Zheng's real strength. But he wasn't even there to attend the third Prince's banquet. He came to see Mu Ning. Suddenly, for no reason, he was being asked to fight with someone. And the disciple was in no mood for something as dull as a competition.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's silence, the man in white sneered and said coldly, "Are you afraid of competing with me, Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Afraid of being defeated and losing face?</p>

  <p>Anyone who comes as a guest of the third Prince is one with real skills, and if you lose, then you will have to get out of here!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! It's not easy to be a guest of Your Highness!" one of the guests roared.</p>

  <p>"The third Prince never treats guests who are losers!" another one spoke up excitedly.</p>

  <p>It was hard not to sigh once Luo Luo Zheng saw the excited and indignant stares of the guests who all looked at him as a competitor.</p>

  <p>By now, the third Prince should have gained the support of several powerful clans, the most important of which were a few top noble clans, including guests attending the banquet today.</p>

  <p>But the resources offered by the third Prince were bound to be limited. If Luo Luo Zheng was involved, they were afraid that he would scramble for part of Ray's resources. As a result, these people regarded him as their common enemy.</p>

  <p>And the third Prince allowed these people to provoke and challenge him to test his real strength, as well as to determine if Luo Luo Zheng was worthy of being recruited as a member of his pool of talents.</p>

  <p>"If Luo Luo Zheng really doesn't want to participate in the competition, then let's just drop it. Since everyone has come to my Feathery Star Hall, all of you are regarded as a friend. Please don't ruin the harmonious relationship among you guys over a small matter," Ray declared. He simpered after speaking.</p>

  <p>While his statement might have sounded as if he wanted to help Luo Luo Zheng with his present predicament, there was a hidden agenda behind it. He wanted to goad Luo Luo Zheng into agreeing to the challenge.</p>

  <p>The man in white shook his head and huffed, "Since the prince has said so, then forget it! It's just so boring here!"</p>

  <p>"So, the Cloud Sect's disciple is such a wimp," another guest said.</p>

  <p>The insults kept coming.</p>

  <p>And as they were getting dirtier and harsher, Luo Luo Zheng furrowed his brows tighter. Then an idea clicked in his brain, and with a smile, he said,</p>

  <p>"Since everyone is in high spirits, and I have nothing to do here, it won't be too much trouble for me if I accept the challenge and provide some entertainment for you guys!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng finished talking, the man in white suddenly turned his head, and a trace of excitement flickered in his eyes. 'Good! I'm glad you choose not to bear the insults and accept my challenge. I was so afraid that you might swallow the humiliation and do nothing about it!' he thought.</p>

  <p>As a guest of the third prince, the man in white couldn't be more aware of what Ray meant, and he would surely try his best to figure out Luo Zheng's real strength during the fight.</p>

  <p>Clapping his hands, Ray declared with glee, "Good!</p>

  <p>I sincerely appreciate your participation and the fun you would bring to us. To add more excitement to today's competition, I'd like to offer a thousand cubic crystals as a reward for anyone who could beat Luo Luo Zheng." The Prince laughed as he made the offer.</p>

  <p>As expected, his guests at the banquet, all of whom were warriors, immediately became excited.</p>

  <p>A thousand cubic crystals were definitely a huge sum of money for those warriors who were not born from the top noble clans.</p>

  <p>It was a rather sneaky trick by Ray, as he was now encouraging these warriors to take turns in fighting against Luo Luo Zheng, hoping to tire him out and eventually defeat him.</p>

  <p>In his mind, Luo Luo Zheng sneered. 'What? So they will take turns to fight against me?' Luo Luo Zheng was not afraid of having several opponents. His endurance was far beyond that of ordinary warriors as his body possessed the function of a spiritual weapon. Moreover, since Luo Luo Zheng decided to participate in the competition, he would not only defeat his opponents but also terrify them with his tough moves. After a few rounds of competition, he was sure not many of the warriors would dare to challenge him.</p>

  <p>After a while, they cleared the center of the Feathery Star Hall to make way for the competition.</p>

  <p>Once there was ample space, the man in white began to float in the air.</p>

  <p>Although warriors could fly after entering the level of Illuminating Soul Realm, there were differences in their flying techniques. In the case of the man in white, his flying method was elegant and flexible as he moved naturally and swiftly like a swallow. After circling in the air, he gently landed on the carpet and stared at Luo Luo Zheng with an unmistakable challenge in his eyes.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng only sauntered towards the carpet, his pace neither fast nor slow, but was very calm.</p>

  <p>"Remember my name," the man in white with his fists cupped, told Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm Doug Zhuo! I hate people who pretend to be very important personalities in this world. So when I meet such people, I have to beat the hell out of them!" he said gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>It was hard not to laugh as soon as Luo Luo Zheng heard Doug's words.</p>

  <p>Dressed in white, Doug looked gentle and elegant and was good-looking and talented, but his words were so crude. The immense contrast elicited an unexpected burst of laughter from the Cloud Sect's disciple.</p>

  <p>"Hmmm... I hope you can still laugh aloud later!" Doug said in anger.</p>

  <p>Using his hands, he started to spread out a little dark red life vitality. The life vitality kept growing through his fingers, and he eventually condensed, then transformed it into ten long claws. At the same time, two wings, which were also produced by condensed life vitality, appeared in Doug's back.</p>

  <p>Seeing the changes in Doug's appearance, Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly and thought quickly, 'Since Doug is a guest of the third Prince, he probably has some special skills. He was likely contemplating a kind of flying bird and then transformed his life vitality into claws and wings.</p>

  <p>So it must be his speed that's exceptional.'</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng stood to reflect on this, Doug's wings flapped, and he began to charge towards the Cloud Sect's disciple so fast that the only thing the audience could see was a string of shadows moving swiftly.</p>
