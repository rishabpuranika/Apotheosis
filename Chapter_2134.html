<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>That last attack had Master Evil panting for his last gasp.</p>

  <p>The energy from that palm blade that struck him was still wreaking havoc in his body, half of which was now paralyzed.</p>

  <p>Yorick, on the other hand, had a faint smile on his face as he walked towards Master Evil. "As a True God, you should know when to give up.</p>

  <p>I never got the chance to obtain that thing in the past. Do you know why I let you obtain it?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil merely lay there at the crevice and stared up at Yorick, refusing to answer.</p>

  <p>"Because I knew that it would provoke Bromley. I'm not stupid. I knew that taking something from a Holy Being was like courting my own death," Yorick continued. "That's why I gave up and that's how it ended up in your hands. In the end, you were just one of my many scapegoats.</p>

  <p>Seven divine eras is indeed a long time but our lifespans are limitless.</p>

  <p>Time is basically nonexistent. Ha-ha-ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>His maniacal laugh echoed in the entire cave, causing a disturbance in the stone. When Luo Luo Zheng heard it, he immediately felt a sharp pain in his ears that made him dizzy.</p>

  <p>Despite his speech, Master Evil remained silent in front of Yorick. This made the latter feel quite bored. With a light sigh, he turned his right hand into a palm blade and once again swung towards Master Evil.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he was about to be dealt by the killing blow, Master Evil wasn't willing to just sit and wait for Yorick's attack. He also raised the devil claw on his left hand and sent it towards his opponent.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, just one flip of Yorick's hand was enough to shatter Master Evil's devil claw. There was the sick sound of shattering bones as Master Evil's left hand was crushed under Yorick's force.</p>

  <p>Master Evil felt a surge of grief in his heart and his hand fell limply to his side. He found himself no longer able to resist what was coming.</p>

  <p>He had spent everything getting that one thing: from shaking the entire Vast Sky Region to almost losing his life at one point. When he did manage to get it, he was inevitably caught by Bromley. Fortunately, Bromley was one of the most merciful Holy Beings in existence which meant Master Evil's life was spared but he would spend it imprisoned in the dungeon of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Seven divine eras - that was how long he spent in the darkness of his cell. In those seven divine eras, it was inevitable for the Vast Sky Region to have changed significantly. He never thought there would still be people who remembered what happened that year and came to grab that thing upon his return.</p>

  <p>With his helpless situation, Master Evil couldn't help but look at his surroundings. He saw Luo Luo Zheng on the other side of the cave, sizing up the Sealing Machine he had previously arranged.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's intense gaze upon the Sealing Machine aroused Master Evil's curiosity. It seemed the cracks on the Sealing Machine were already increasing in number.</p>

  <p>The spot of light in the ball was clearly flickering and the frequency was getting faster and faster.</p>

  <p>"That thing... Has it already hatched?" Master Evil murmured.</p>

  <p>His heart then began to beat at a wild pace.</p>

  <p>That thing had been stored for several divine eras. How could it still hatch? And at this very moment?</p>

  <p>That couldn't be right. That thing possessed extreme intelligence. Once it hatched, it would definitely know how powerful the Sealing Machine was. It would not dare break through this ball because if it did, it would definitely be killed by the Sealing Machine's swords.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he resolved this Sealing Machine, this thing began to break out of its shell.</p>

  <p>The crackling sounds grew louder as more cracks appeared on the ball's surface. Just as Yorick was finally about to end Master Evil, a strange sound came from behind him. He turned around and saw something fly out from within the ball and charge at him with an incomparably fast speed.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, Yorick's reflexes were quick and he was able to twist to the side to avoid whatever it was that charged at him. He then used his fan and chopped towards that thing.</p>

  <p>However, that thing was also exceptionally nimble. It merely dodged the feather fan and climbed onto Yorick's arm.</p>

  <p>It was only now that Luo Luo Zheng finally saw what that thing was. It was a mouse, about the size of a palm. It had an extremely sharp head with a pair of long and thin tusks. On its tail was a small dot of light that continuously flickered on and off.</p>

  <p>This strange mouse had gone up Yorick's arm and suddenly burrowed itself into it.</p>

  <p>The True Gods' physiques were naturally much stronger than world lords'. Yorick might not be a body refiner but he had a far stronger body than an ordinary warrior, also, summoning the 'Moody Ghost' with his feather fan earlier made him even stronger.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't seem to matter at all for the mouse who drilled into Yorick's skin as if it was mere, soft mud. It dug itself into his flesh and became a fist-sized bulge that swiftly went up along his arm.</p>

  <p>This immediately filled Yorick with anxiety. He pointed his right hand towards the bulge on his left arm with a ruthless glint in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>A sharp, hidden force shot out from his fingertips and carved out a bloody hole on his arm. Unfortunately, this didn't seem to harm the strange mouse who continued to move along Yorick's body.</p>

  <p>And so began Yorick's relentless pursuit of this strange mouse, leaving hole after bloody hole on his arm. In the end though, the mouse simply moved from his shoulder and began to drill into his organs.</p>

  <p>Yorick's face warped with deep fear as he felt this strange mouse gnaw his insides.</p>

  <p>As a True God, even if all of his internal organs were emptied out, he would still not die. There were only two fatal parts in his body: his cinnabar field and his soul.</p>

  <p>However, what was most amazing about this mouse was that it could gnaw an enemy's physical body while simultaneously destroying and absorbing their inner world at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>If Yorick's inner world was destroyed, he would end up becoming a cripple.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he had to move fast, Yorick gritted his teeth and endured the pain of the mouse literally eating him from the inside. He pointed at his chest and continuously shot out a series of attacks.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Numerous bloody holes appeared on his chest; even his heart wasn't spared and blood continuously gushed forth from his body.</p>

  <p>However, the mouse remained nimble and was now quickly drilling its way to his lower abdomen.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterward, Yorick felt a numbing sensation in his cinnabar field. He fell to the ground with a plop as his body convulsed involuntarily.</p>

  <p>All of these events happened in a span of ten seconds. Both Luo Luo Zheng and Master Evil couldn't help but gasp in shock as they watched such a gruesome scene.</p>

  <p>What kind of mouse was that? How could it be so powerful?</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Luo Zheng noticed a small bulge appear on Yorick's lower abdomen before bursting out in a spray of fresh blood. The mouse had drilled itself out of Yorick's body through his stomach. With a sassy flick of its head, it spat out a jade-green thing from its mouth and onto the ground.</p>

  <p>It seemed to be an octagonal gemstone that flickered with a faint green light and emitted a unique 'momentum.' It was Yorick's Godly Tile!</p>

  <p>This Godly Tile was incomparably sturdy and impossible to destroy. The mouse would be unable to swallow it but it still managed to tear it out from Yorick's inner world.</p>

  <p>After spitting out the Godly Tile, the mouse then looked up at Luo Luo Zheng and sized him up with its bean-sized eyes.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he was only a world lord, the mouse let out two squeaks and leaped towards Master Evil instead.</p>
