<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 124 Sky-rending Hoop (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>This was not the first time that Luo Luo Zheng encountered a nature creature.</p>

  <p>Several days ago, he confronted and killed White Fiend and Black Fiend with his old, dilapidated flying knife.</p>

  <p>His successful assassination of White Fiend and Black Fiend could be mainly ascribed to this old and broken flying knife.</p>

  <p>But now Luo Luo Zheng was fighting inside a battle ring.</p>

  <p>Although Cloud Sect had no strict rules regarding the use of weapons inside a battle ring, he knew that the flying knife would cause serious injuries, even death, if he used it. In a peak-level challenge of this caliber, Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to kill his opponent.</p>

  <p>The golden hoop was full of life vitality. Gleaming with metallic luster, it fluttered in the air, humming and buzzing.</p>

  <p>As the golden ring drew closer to Luo Luo Zheng, it became bigger, as though it was going to encircle him.</p>

  <p>"That's great!" exclaimed Luo Luo Zheng. He had already planned a counter-attack for the golden ring.</p>

  <p>As a streak of purple light enveloped his body, Luo Luo Zheng fiercely flung his fist toward the golden ring.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The golden ring produced a crisp sound when it came into contact with Luo Zheng's fist. It turned flat upon impact and flew back for about 60 feet from the battle ring.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, Jesse chuckled. Seeing his golden ring flying so far away, he stretched out his hand. A buzzing could be heard as the golden ring whizzed toward its master. As soon as the ring returned to Jesse, regained its original shape. In the blink of an eye, Jesse tossed the golden ring at Luo Luo Zheng, in an attempt to trap him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, another golden ring showed up in Jesse's hand. This new ring had been crafted from Jesse's life vitality as well. Jesse directed the second ring toward his opponent without giving Luo Luo Zheng a chance to defend against the first ring.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>As before, both rings flew back upon impact with Luo Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>Very soon, Luo Luo Zheng understood what Jesse intended to do.</p>

  <p>However, by the time Luo Luo Zheng came to this realization, it was a little too late.</p>

  <p>He saw that Jesse still stood where he had been, unceasingly waving his hands in the air. Then, one after another, more and more golden rings appeared around his hands.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, seven golden rings were hovering over the battle ring.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng made a tenacious effort to hit these rings to prevent them from trapping him. However, Luo Luo Zheng struggled to withstand the attacks of several rings.</p>

  <p>At last, a golden ring flew through a flaw in Luo Zheng's counter attack and trapped Luo Luo Zheng. The golden ring tightened around Luo Zheng's torso, securing both his arms.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that you can trap me with only a ring?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng struggled in an attempt to loosen the golden ring and throw it off him.</p>

  <p>He had assumed that based on his current strength, he could confront a nature creature. Luo Luo Zheng was also confident that he could use his power to break the golden ring.</p>

  <p>As he had expected, the golden ring didn't hold up against his aggressive struggle. Soon, it began to show faint cracks. But at this moment, other rings flew toward Luo Luo Zheng and encircled him, one after another.</p>

  <p>One or two golden rings couldn't withstand Luo Zheng's mighty power.</p>

  <p>But when seven rings confined him, Luo Luo Zheng felt challenged to free himself.</p>

  <p>Just like a chopstick was easy to break, but it was extremely difficult to break a bunch of chopsticks.</p>

  <p>As the rings imprisoned him, Luo Luo Zheng took a deep breath and grumbled in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Immediately, dark green light sparkled over seven dragon scales in his mind, and a great surge of strength was produced in him. A physical change could be seen in Luo Luo Zheng as veins popped out all over his body.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng made every effort to break away, the rings didn't budge.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Jesse strolled over to Luo Luo Zheng. With a light chuckle, he said, "It is impossible for you to shake off the rings. Even nature creatures can't get away when my sky-binding hoops fetter them. You will be unable to break away even though your strength is far mightier than others who are at the same level as you. Now, you have been defeated."</p>

  <p>Spectators from Vulture Peak were stunned at this scene and took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>They had witnessed the incredible power of Jesse's sky-binding hoops many times before.</p>

  <p>Before Jesse was a half-step into the nature level, his sky-binding hoops, which were only filled with life energy, had been so insuperable that no one at Vulture Peak could break free from them.</p>

  <p>Now, Jesse had become a nature creature. The power of his sky-binding hoops was substantive. To be sure, Luo Luo Zheng, who was only at the marrow refining level, couldn't break away from the rings.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had attempted to struggle and escape twice but failed. In view of his futile efforts, he gave up. At the same time, he forced a bitter smile across his face and snapped back, "You've just trapped me. But does this mean that I've been defeated?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's question left Jesse shocked, and he responded, "You can't move your hands or legs. And so, it is beyond doubt that you have been defeated."</p>

  <p>"But as you can see, I am still standing inside the battle ring, right?" Luo Luo Zheng retorted.</p>

  <p>For a battle ring challenge, whether a person won or not was dependent upon two cases. The first way to ensure victory was to knock the opponent out so that he couldn't stand up anymore. The other way was to throw the opponent out of the battle ring.</p>

  <p>As soon as he heard Luo Zheng's quibbling, Jesse sneered at Luo Luo Zheng who was trying to play a petty trick on him. Then, he retorted, "Well, since you feel so strongly about this, let me throw you out of the battle ring!</p>

  <p>Afterward, I will be the winner!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Jesse extended one of his hands and pointed it at the golden rings trapping Luo Luo Zheng. Immediately, the rings trembled and jingled as though they had received an order from Jesse.</p>

  <p>After that, they pulled Luo Luo Zheng toward the edge of the battle ring.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng reached the corner of the battle ring, Jesse felt a sharp pain in his brain. This pain seemed to be spiritual, as a result of which, Jesse nearly fainted.</p>

  <p>"Ahh!"</p>

  <p>Jesse gave a horrible shriek while holding his head with both hands.</p>

  <p>The scene inside the battle ring confused the spectators.</p>
