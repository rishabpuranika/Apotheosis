<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 83 An Angry Master Su (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The sound of a pen 'skritching' across the paper in a hurry, was all that could be heard in Master Su's room.</p>

  <p>Sitting at her desk writing, Master Su didn't look as tired as she felt; instead, she looked as beautiful as an ethereal and delicate as a fairy in her rich purple gown adorned with embroidered clouds.</p>

  <p>Glancing at the pile of work stacked on her desk, Aura Su clenched her jaw, rolling her eyes in disdain.</p>

  <p>With several of Drizzle Peak's masters off today, she was left to handle it all herself.</p>

  <p>Master Su was well aware that the work was left to her on purpose. Did they really think she would surrender just because of the heavy workload? Never!</p>

  <p>While Master Su was engrossed in the task at hand, Zheng appeared in the doorway and saw the purple figure bent over the desk. He knocked on the door.</p>

  <p>"Rap, rap, rap," the sound startled Master Su, and her head shot up. Zheng's appearance was unexpected and she was caught off guard. Her face took on an unnatural hue briefly, and she quickly recovered and asked, "Hello Zheng, what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>Stepping into the room, Zheng replied, "Hello Master Su, I am here to claim some assignments."</p>

  <p>"Assignments?" asked Master Su as she blinked. She smiled as she looked up at him. "Actually, you don't need to be so eager. The outer disciples will soon be given some pills, and that should be plenty for you to use to refine yourself."</p>

  <p>Ordinarily, there was no rush for a new outer disciple recruit to do a task.</p>

  <p>Since the outer disciples' strength was relatively low right now, even if they accepted a task, it would only be simple ones they would be able to manage.</p>

  <p>Because the points for these simple tasks were relatively small, and the loss outweighed the rewards, it was better to train at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head in disagreement, Zheng said, "I don't want pills, what I need are points."</p>

  <p>Since he had a body as strong as a mysterious weapon, Zheng ignored the conventional pills. He knew the Cloud Sect was rich, after all, even the pills that the outer disciples received were much better quality than the ones other families had.</p>

  <p>But, regardless of how good the pills were, they weren't better than the Magical Pill. When Zheng was being beaten, it was as if he was taking a Magical Pill. So, naturally, he didn't need any pills.</p>

  <p>"What's the rush to obtain points?" asked Master Su.</p>

  <p>"I just need the points," asserted Zheng, thinking about how his need went far beyond 'a rush to get them, ' as Master Su said. He needed a million points!</p>

  <p>Naturally acquiring that many points would take a reasonably long time, and at this stage, he was still working at getting his first hundred points.</p>

  <p>In his current situation, he lacked the resources and force to rescue Yan from Hell Mountain, but perhaps, he could visit her, right?</p>

  <p>Seeing how stubborn Zheng was, Master Su remained silent. Reaching out, she opened a pamphlet that was lying next to her and handed it to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then, in a crisp tone, she said, "This pamphlet contains the most elementary tasks, choose one of them."</p>

  <p>Examining the booklet closely, Zheng discovered that the tasks were all handwritten.</p>

  <p>"Serve the Li family in the Imperial Capital by taking care of the house.</p>

  <p>Three days, three points..."</p>

  <p>"Serve as a bodyguard to help the Howe Escort Agency in transporting cargo. Seven days, seven points..."</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Seeing the point amounts took Zheng's breath away.</p>

  <p>The rewards for each task was too small, and at one point a day, it would take well over three months to accumulate a hundred points to perform these tasks.</p>

  <p>At this rate, it would take a million days for Zheng to earn enough points to rescue his sister, Yan performing tasks like these.</p>

  <p>"What? Not enough points being offered for you? At first, you might think that, but you get used to it after a while," commented Master Su smiling brilliantly.</p>

  <p>Although her smile appeared sweet, Zheng saw the shrewd look of a businessman behind her eyes.</p>

  <p>The fact of the matter was that the number of points wasn't too small, considering that three points could be converted to six cubic crystals, which was a tremendous sum of money to some families. What was more, since the Cloud Sect received a portion for expenses, they actually spent more money on these tasks.</p>

  <p>"Are there any tasks that offer more points?" inquired Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are. but unfortunately, you can't accept them," remarked Master Su while waving her hand dismissively.</p>

  <p>All Zheng had on his mind was how many points there were. He didn't care whether or not he was able to accept them. Hurriedly, Zheng asked, "How do you know that, if I haven't tried? Can I at least look at them?"</p>

  <p>While the request was unorthodox and even unreasonable, Master Su produced a second pamphlet, placing it in front of him.</p>

  <p>Not bothering to check out what each task was, Zheng looked at the row of points, and saw that the first task offered two hundred points!</p>

  <p>Glancing over to what was required, Zheng's first reaction was shock.</p>

  <p>"The assignment is to hunt a shadow beast, skin it, and bring back the whole hide intact"</p>

  <p>In the eastern part of the Eastern Region, shadow beasts were a unique species that lived in the Shadow Forest. Since the species was less fertile, they were rare. But, the strength of a single beast was so fierce, that it was rumored if someone at the nature refining level hunted one of these creatures, they would find it almost impossible to make it back alive...</p>

  <p>Skimming the next task, Zheng saw the reward was two hundred points.</p>

  <p>This time the requirement was to track and apprehend an infamous prisoner who escaped many years ago.</p>
