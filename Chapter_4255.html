  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Nian looked up. He stepped forward without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Now that he'd come so far, what else was there to fear?</p>

  <p>At the end of the Boundless Shock World, the staircase stopped in front of an ordinary stone door. In contrast with the rest of the exquisite Levitation Tower, the surface of the door was rough and unpolished.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian did not stop to think it over. He reached out and pushed the door open.</p>

  <p>The door creaked as it swung open.</p>

  <p>It had not been opened for many years, but the rough material was still intact.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw what lay behind the door, Luo Nian paused, surprised.</p>

  <p>Through the doorway was a space as rough and craggy as the door itself.</p>

  <p>It was as though every inch of ground had been filled in with crushed, jagged stones.</p>

  <p>The space inside the door belonged to the fifth-grade world. The Levitation Tower had become normal at this point. However, that wasn't Luo Nian's main concern.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Heavenly Ring Staff?" Luo Nian asked, turning to face the little girl.</p>

  <p>The little girl stood a step behind him, making no move to pass through the door. She did not have the right to enter the top floor.</p>

  <p>"Go in and find it yourself," she answered, still feeling a sense of dissatisfaction towards Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian nodded. He stepped into the room at the top floor and looked around him.</p>

  <p>His gaze landed on a purple crystal pillar in the center of the space. He walked towards it, examining it closely. When he got closer, he saw that there seemed to be some wooden object embedded in the pillar.</p>

  <p>His eyes lit up as he realized what it was. "This is the Heavenly Ring Staff!"</p>

  <p>The staff had a strange, unwieldy shape, which was why Luo Nian hadn't recognized it immediately.</p>

  <p>However, since it was the only object of note on the top floor of the Levitation Tower, it must be the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian felt as though he was about to burst with excitement. He'd finally found it. Right now, this was the most important thing in the world to him.</p>

  <p>He moved back a few paces and raised his left hand, spreading his fingers.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he balled his right hand into a fist, allowing energy to flow through him. He sent a blast of power towards the pillar.</p>

  <p>The blast crashed into the purple crystal.</p>

  <p>But there was no boom, only a faint, muffled sound.</p>

  <p>The purple crystal pillar was completely unharmed by the blast. It had not moved an inch, nor had it sustained any cracks or other damage.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was taken aback. He prepared to use several more theurgies to obtain the staff from inside the pillar.</p>

  <p>With his cultivation base as a True God, he was powerful in the universe.</p>

  <p>But he was weak in the divine land, let alone in this fifth-grade world.</p>

  <p>He displayed his full power and pushed himself to the limit, but it was no use. The purple crystal still stood there. He could not even leave a single scratch on the pillar.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian stopped to assess the situation. He realized that he simply wasn't strong enough to get the staff within the pillar.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that Elder Xue couldn't hold on any longer, '" he muttered to himself. "If he had managed to come here with me before he died, he could have broken open the pillar since he had the physical body of the Elemental race."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian returned to the door, deciding to ask the little girl for help.</p>

  <p>After all, she was the guide of the Levitation Tower. She might not help him, but it was worth a shot. It had not been easy for him to reach the top floor of the tower, and he was unwilling to give up after all his effort. He needed to find a way to break the pillar.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the little girl seemed puzzled, and unable to offer any direct solution. "This is beyond my abilities," she said. "I can't enter this door, and I don't know how to unravel what's inside. But I think that Clarence, in his infinite wisdom, would never leave you in a dead end. Try to explore further and search for clues inside."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was disappointed at the vague answer, but still, what she said made sense. He reentered through the doorway of the top floor.</p>

  <p>He glanced around again. "Except for the purple crystal pillar and these rough stones, there is nothing else... So, since I can't break the purple crystal pillar, I must find the answer in these rough stones," he mused.</p>

  <p>He bent to examine the rough stones beneath his feet, and found that each stone had a series of small bulges on its surface. Each bulge was about the size of his fist.</p>

  <p>A thought flashed through Luo Nian's mind.</p>

  <p>'Could there be something hidden in these stones?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>He extended a hand towards a nearby stone, scratching its surface.</p>

  <p>The rough stone was softer than it looked, as it was made of sand. In moments, Luo Nian had used his fingers to pry sand from its surface.</p>

  <p>It took some effort, but eventually, the sand was cleared off, exposing an oval object. Luo Nian's eyes narrowed as he stared at the object. It looked soft, like a piece of flesh embedded in stone, and he could feel heat and energy rising from it.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he said to himself.</p>

  <p>Without giving it a second thought, Luo Nian reached down with both hands, grabbing at the fleshy oval object to pull it out from the stone.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, as soon as he touched it, the soft flesh sank down beneath his grip. His ten fingers were embedded in the object.</p>

  <p>He immediately tried to pull away, but his fingers were stuck. Like melted candy, the fleshy object had integrated with his hands. It was stuck to his skin and he could not pull loose no matter how hard he tried.</p>

  <p>"This thing has drilled into my hands!" Luo Nian muttered in surprise.</p>

  <p>Inwardly, he was greatly unsettled. "Calm down! Calm down!" he told himself, trying to control his nerves.</p>

  <p>Here, there was no one to rely on but himself. He could not afford to give in to his panic.</p>

  <p>He could feel the flesh continuously integrating with his hands, but it was not painful at all. Indeed, the only sensation was an enveloping warmth.</p>

  <p>As Luo Nian watched, unable to do anything, the flesh fused with his own tissue, spreading along the surface of his arms. He found it deeply disturbing, but as far as he could tell, it wasn't doing him any harm.</p>

  <p>Several minutes later, the flesh seemed to have completely integrated with his body. Luo Nian could find no sign of the fusion except that his hands were slightly thicker, and looked a tad more awkward. Still, he was able to move freely, and to his shock, he soon realized that his strength had increased significantly.</p>

  <p>This flesh contained astonishing energy!</p>

  <p>"This is? This is a reward!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian spluttered, flexing his fingers experimentally.</p>

  <p>When he had reached the height of two hundred feet, the Levitation Tower had given him and Elder Xue a reward for their souls. Now, he had received a reward for his physical body.</p>

  <p>"As long as I absorb enough flesh, I can break the purple crystal pillar!" he exclaimed. Luo Nian finally knew what he needed to do.</p>

  <p>He began vigorously scratching at the bulges on the surface of another rough stone near him. When he removed the layer of sand on the surface, he saw another lump of oval flesh.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the flesh without hesitation, allowing it to integrate into his body.</p>

  <p>By his estimation, there were about four hundred rough stones like this on the top floor. Luo Nian patiently dug out the oval flesh one by one, absorbing each into his body.</p>

  <p>As he worked, Luo Nian felt a tremendous change in his body. After consuming the flesh in hundreds of stones, he realized that his body size had expanded to four times its normal size.</p>

  <p>'My soul is comparable to those of the masters in the Deep Space, and my physical body has now also reached a high level. If I return to the chaos, the strength of my physical body alone would be enough to terrify my father, ' Luo Nian thought. Finally, he grabbed the last stone.</p>

  <p>With his newfound strength, he needed only to scratch the surface lightly to get out the flesh from within.</p>

  <p>He absorbed the final piece of flesh. Then he stood straight, stretching out his arms and legs, testing his increased strength. He felt invigorated and very powerful. Feeling anticipation rise inside him, he headed back towards the purple crystal pillar.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Ring Staff is mine now!" he cried.</p>

  <p>He clenched his hand into a fist and punched the pillar with all his might.</p>

  <p>This time, there was an earsplitting cracking sound.</p>

  <p>The top portion of the solid purple crystal pillar splintered, then smashed into pieces. The upper half of the Heavenly Ring Staff was revealed.</p>
