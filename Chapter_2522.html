<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman wore a blouse and a skirt made out of coarse cloth.</p>

  <p>Although she was dressed in shabby clothes, her astonishing beauty was unrivaled. On the face of it, this stunning woman seemed out of place in a humble tribe such as this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze fell on the woman and comprehension dawned on him.</p>

  <p>The woman's cultivation base was not obvious, but her body emitted a unique, magnetic aura.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if she was a body refiner, but not entirely so.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that she was no match for him, but she was obviously far stronger than most ordinary people.</p>

  <p>What made Luo Zheng more intrigued, however, was that the aura she emitted was very similar to that of the wild bone in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Zelda!"</p>

  <p>The teenager's face lit up at the sight of the woman.</p>

  <p>As the others heard Zelda's words, they were embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Zelda held a very high position in the tribe. More importantly, each time an adversity knocked on their doors, she was the first to step up and chase it away.</p>

  <p>If Zelda left, the tribe would probably die out when the next disaster came.</p>

  <p>The conflicts between their tribe and the Macon Tribe were never-ending. Members often got involved in disputes. Each time, it was Zelda who acted as mediator and put an end to their mischief.</p>

  <p>"Zelda, what if the Wights come again?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know how to face them without you. The members of the Macon Tribe are waiting for a chance to pounce on us and make trouble!"</p>

  <p>Zelda had an undisturbed expression on her face. "Didn't you say that these disasters are brought upon us by Luther? If I leave with Luther, no disaster will happen to you, correct? So what is there to worry about?"</p>

  <p>"Well..." The man with cropped hair fell short of words, not knowing how to retort to this matter-of-fact statement.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zelda had brought Luther back, the Wights often broke out from the Immemorial Wilderness to attack the tribe.</p>

  <p>But truthfully, this had occurred before Luther was brought back too.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the man was speechless, Zelda smiled coldly. She walked up to Luther, saying, "Let's go home."</p>

  <p>The teenager, Luther, nodded and obediently followed her.</p>

  <p>But Zelda turned her head and looked at Luo Zheng. "Did you save Luther?" she asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared back, nodding in reply.</p>

  <p>Zelda, who had been sullen all this while, cracked a small, genuine smile. "Thank you. Would you like to come to my house?"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng arrived at Zelda's house, he realized that the tribe was a lot poorer than he had initially imagined.</p>

  <p>In the middle of Zelda's empty thatched hut was lit a fire. Dried meat hung on one corner of the wall. The walls had been patched up untidily and there were few belongings to be seen, a sign of squalor.</p>

  <p>After boiling a pot of water, Zelda sat down on one side of the fire. She glanced at Luo Zheng. "You're a True God. You have your own inner world, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows twitched in surprise at the astute observation.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted. "How did you know that?"</p>

  <p>If one wanted to know someone else's cultivation base, one had to be at a certain level.</p>

  <p>It would not be odd if Zelda was a low-rank True God, but Luo Zheng clearly could not sense any cultivation from her.</p>

  <p>A speculative expression appeared on Zelda's face. She stared at Luo Zheng for a long while before smiling. "Where do you come from? It seems as if you know nothing."</p>

  <p>Luther giggled beside her. "Zelda, I find it strange too. He asked a lot along the way. He seems to know nothing about the Immemorial Wilderness."</p>

  <p>Luther appeared to be naive, but in fact he was a scheming one. He had long suspected Luo Zheng's origins.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but I cannot tell you that," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had first entered the divine land, he had extracted a lot of information out of Wynn.</p>

  <p>This time, however, he had been sent out by his mother and had landed here. He knew nothing of the world at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Everyone has their secrets." Zelda did not comment on it further. After all, Luo Zheng had saved Luther. She owed him. She then continued, "The reason I can tell your cultivation level is that I am a Wild God myself."</p>

  <p>"A Wild God?" Luo Zheng was slightly stunned. He had never heard of this title before in his life and never come across any Wild God on the divine land.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded. "There are few True Gods who practice the life vitality here, so I suspect that you are the son of a certain great force. But you have never been out, so you know nothing."</p>

  <p>Normally, Luo Zheng would have been able to tell Zelda's cultivation base from a mere glance. She was a low-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>However, he had never before encountered any Wild God. He could only feel her exude a certain unique aura, which made it hard to pinpoint her cultivation base.</p>

  <p>"Is the Wild God you said related to the wild bone?" Luo Zheng finally remembered the wild bone. After all, the aura that Zelda gave off was similar to the energy of the wild bone. He slowly fished out the wild bone from his pocket.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the wild bone, Zelda's eyes lit up and she nodded. "Yes, the power of Wild Gods comes from the wild bones."</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods practiced an entirely different cultivation system.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the chaos, all resources were scarce.</p>

  <p>Creatures did not possess any resources to cultivate life vitality and it was even more inconceivable for them to create a small divine land like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, this world was fair. The bones could be found at the bottom of the chaos and covered an area as vast as the ocean itself. They were far too many to count.</p>

  <p>Many of them were the forgotten remains of powerful men.</p>

  <p>Over the centuries, these men had turned into wild bones, neither weathering nor decomposing.</p>

  <p>The creatures at the bottom of the chaos absorbed the energy in the wild bones for cultivation. This way, their strength advanced rapidly. In the end, they became Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>However, despite the huge number of wild bones, they existed to be used up one day.</p>

  <p>Zelda's tribe made a living out of picking the wild bones. Every once in a while, strong warriors arrived to exchange their necessary supplies for a batch of the wild bones.</p>

  <p>Of course, a part of the wild bones was left to Zelda for cultivation.</p>

  <p>In the past half a year however, the number of wild bones dug out by the tribe had reduced significantly. So far, they had only accumulated less than twenty pieces.</p>

  <p>If they sold all the wild bones, Zelda would not have any left for her own cultivation.</p>

  <p>Luther was well aware that Zelda needed the extra wild bones to reach a higher level. Determined and sullen, he took a risk to go deeper into the Immemorial Wilderness. The more dangerous a site, the higher the probability of finding the wild bones.</p>

  <p>However, he did not expect to be chased by a group of Wights after being lucky enough to dig out three wild bones. At long last, he was saved by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed in his heart, finally perceiving the situation.</p>

  <p>These people had managed to establish a unique training system with the support of the ghastly wild bones. It was commendable.</p>
