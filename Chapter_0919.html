<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 919 Cultivate Warrior Spirit (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Their eyes lit up as Xun spoke the name of the treasure. If they could collect this treasure, then that would surely mean... Could it be?</p>

  <p>Adolph, the owner of this gate, had nature under his thumb, which meant this treasure must undoubtedly be at the sacred level at least. Treasures above this level had never appeared on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>However, Xun's next words doused their hope, as if being drenched in ice cold water. "Don't even think of refining the Gate of Samsara! It's of no use. Leave alone you guys, even Amber won't be able to do it."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Fabian asked.</p>

  <p>Xun ignored his question and only said, "Try it and you'll know."</p>

  <p>Admittedly, temptation of the Gate of Samsara was too great for everyone, including Fabian. If they could bring the gate back, it would, without a doubt, be the most precious treasure of their clan.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod didn't believe Xun and walked on towards the gate.</p>

  <p>Esther also wanted to give it a try, but Xun was her queen, and she didn't doubt what Xun had said. If Xun said that the gate couldn't be taken away, that was it. Esther contained the impulse to try refining it in her heart.</p>

  <p>As Fabian and Jarrod walked towards the gate, they saw that the words on the gate became bigger and bigger.</p>

  <p>Each of these words gave out a blinding Mu Ning. Only then did they realize that this was precisely why it was extremely difficult to approach the gate.</p>

  <p>"It's strange! Really strange!" Fabian exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The gate had been standing there for years. The Mu Ning of the words written on it was constantly weakening with the passage of time. But it still was frightening. Just a few words, without any visible source of power being poured into them, made it difficult for Fabian and Jarrod to advance.</p>

  <p>They couldn't help but wonder about how powerful the owner of the gate was.</p>

  <p>It took Fabian and Jarrod quite a few minutes to get close to the gate. They were already sweating profusely as they gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>"This gate is so weird!"</p>

  <p>"But we're finally here!"</p>

  <p>They rested for a while, during which, both of them were preoccupied with their own thoughts. Luo Luo Zheng was also here, and the woman who had presented herself as his sword spirit had said that no one could refine the gate. If they made it, they could take it away. This thought excited them, and they itched to try it out.</p>

  <p>"I'll go first," Fabian said, his jaw set and fists clenched. He also knew that it wouldn't be easy to refine this gate, so he cut open his fingertip and used his own blood to assist in the refinement.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Luo Luo Zheng looked at the sarcastic expression on Xun's face and said, "You should give them a clear explanation."</p>

  <p>"What else should I explain? I've already warned them, but they just don't listen." Xun shook her head before she continued, "It's useless!"</p>

  <p>Yolande also shook her head but remained silent. She also knew that it was wishful thinking to expect to refine this gate. But she was unemotional, quiet, and reserved. Even if she knew that no one would succeed, she wouldn't remind them.</p>

  <p>Fabian made a great effort to establish a connection with the gate using his own blood. However, the moment the connection worked, an invisible repulsive force shot out from the gate.</p>

  <p>The force was so powerful that it pushed Fabian away and he fell heavily to the ground.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the force had done nothing more than push him away. If it had been used with the intent to kill, then he would have been killed hundreds of times.</p>

  <p>"Are you alright?" Jarrod asked, concerned. Looking at Fabian's sorry state, he knew that there was no point trying anymore.</p>

  <p>After escaping death, Fabian became more determined. He jumped up from the ground and with a disbelieving look, said angrily, "I can't believe this!</p>

  <p>But I know that I must take this gate back today!"</p>

  <p>The moment he uttered the last word, he rushed ahead again and tried to put the gate into his space ring.</p>

  <p>The space ring contained the power of infinite space. But it was made of material and was different from the Space Law that most martial artists had comprehended. Fabian wanted to use the ring's power of space to take the gate.</p>

  <p>As long as he could get it back, he would have plenty of opportunities to refine it. Even if he couldn't refine it, it would be a sacred object in the sacred place. This was exactly his plan.</p>

  <p>"He won't make it," Xun said.</p>

  <p>Yolande gently shook her head. As she stared at the words on the gate, grief came in waves.</p>

  <p>As Fabian tried to suck the gate into his space ring, a crack appeared on his ring. Surprised, he cried out before hurriedly throwing his ring away.</p>

  <p>Whirling... Bang!</p>

  <p>His ring spun several times before it suddenly exploded. At the same time as it exploded, a small spatial vortex appeared, swallowing up the ring before finally completely disappearing.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! My space ring!" Fabian cried out again. He wanted to sob but no tears came out.</p>

  <p>The space within the space ring wasn't always stable. Most space rings had a time limit, and some could only last five to ten years after being forged.</p>

  <p>These were low grade space rings, and their space was extremely small.</p>

  <p>The space ring that Luo Luo Zheng had gotten from Evil Lan was a low grade one.</p>

  <p>Because its space wasn't stable enough, after several years, the Sumeru Space would collapse and everything stored within would vanish like smoke.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the space ring that Ning Yudie had given Luo Luo Zheng was pretty good. The space inside was more than a hundred times larger and was much more stable. The Sumeru Space within would not collapse for at least fifty or even a hundred years.</p>

  <p>Fabian's space ring was about the same grade as Luo Zheng's. All his things were stored inside. He had forcefully used his space ring in the hope of absorbing the Gate of Samsara. But what he hadn't expected was that his ring would be directly activated by the gate, causing the ring to collapse.</p>

  <p>"Serves you right," Xun sneered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng put up his hands, as if to indicate people to leave him out. He was not going to get involved in this.</p>

  <p>"My Queen, what is the use of this gate if it cannot be taken away?" Esther asked Xun.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled mysteriously and said, "Although it cannot be taken away, it is very useful to you."</p>

  <p>"What? Why?" Luo Luo Zheng chipped in.</p>

  <p>"As its name, the Gate of Samsara, suggests, one of its most important abilities is to let you experience the endless cycle of birth and suffering and death and rebirth. It can cultivate your warrior spirit," Xun answered.</p>

  <p>"It can cultivate warrior spirit?" Esther, Luo Luo Zheng, and the others felt that was rather inconceivable.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Xun nodded.</p>

  <p>Warriors of the Lower World like Luo Luo Zheng, Esther, and Fabian felt that the warrior spirit had to be slowly sharpened. They had to constantly take blows, exert themselves, and stabilize their spirit. This was a method for a warrior to temper his spirit, and also a process for a young warrior to mature slowly.</p>

  <p>But in the final analysis, the warrior spirit was only a part of their personality. To put it bluntly, it was their spirit. How could they cultivate it?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the others couldn't figure it out at all.</p>

  <p>Looking at their disbelieving faces, Xun said, "In the Upper World, all kinds of cultivation methods are unimaginable. Since the Gate of Samsara is here, I think Yolande wouldn't mind if you enter to cultivate. Am I right, Yolande?"</p>
