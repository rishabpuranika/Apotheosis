</p>

  <p>Wurth could not remember how many years it had been since the crystal core of an adult fire scorpion lion had last appeared.</p>

  <p>After all, he was less than 20 years old. And from his earliest memory of the Blessed Auction House, they had never auctioned the crystal core of an adult fire scorpion lion.</p>

  <p>So, Wurth was very curious about where Zheng got this crystal core of a fire scorpion lion. What was more surprising was that it was from an adult lion. However, he managed to keep his curiosity to himself and did not ask his questions. As a legitimate successor of the Blessed Zhang family, he was familiar with the rules of the auction house. The first rule was not to ask about the origin of goods brought by customers. It was taboo in the auction industry. He soon calmed down and acted very professionally.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, this crystal core of an adult fire scorpion lion can be auctioned for an excellent price. It is very precious and rare. Do you want to sell it in this auction, or wait for the next? If you wait for the next auction, we, the Blessed Auction House, can help you release some information in advance to attract those who are particularly interested in the crystal core of fire scorpion lion. Then, the price will be higher than it is today,"</p>

  <p>Wurth commented.</p>

  <p>This crystal core was so precious that ordinary people might not be able to afford to buy it. If given some time, the Blessed Auction House could attract those who not only had an interest but could also afford to buy the object during the auction. Then the price would be much higher than now.</p>

  <p>"How about today? I don't mind if we sell it today." Zheng decided without hesitation. He was not tempted by the potential of getting a higher price.</p>

  <p>Wurth did not insist when he saw Zheng's determination. Instead, he nodded and said, "That's fine. In this auction, we plan to sell some precious refining materials and alchemy materials. And these have already appealed to many old, powerful refiners in the Imperial Capital. I believe that the crystal core of fire scorpion lion could also fetch a very good price."</p>

  <p>After reaching this agreement with Zheng, Wurth led Zheng to the back hall of the auction house.</p>

  <p>Once they had entered the back hall of the auction house, Zheng felt a burst of dazzling energy.</p>

  <p>In the rooms behind each door of the back hall stood nature-level powers. And the stress of these nature creatures tingled Zheng's senses. He could feel that they were dangerous. Their strengths were equal to or even stronger than Randall's.</p>

  <p>And in the center of the back hall, Zheng saw that the auction house's staff were carrying bundles of valuable medicine, articles, treasures, and weapons back and forth.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at these goods and found that almost all of these items were rare treasures. The value of any of these items perhaps equaled the Luo Clan's wealth, which had been accumulated for hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>"Nestor!" Wurth shouted after he entered the back hall.</p>

  <p>On hearing his name being called, an old man who stood not far away put down his work, bowed down and then came toward Wurth. When he walked closer, Zheng noticed that the old man was slim, and his appearance was shrewd. The old man bowed to Wurth and said, "Young master, what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Where is my brother?" Wurth asked.</p>

  <p>"The young master went to the front hall to welcome the guests," Nestor answered.</p>

  <p>"That's fine. You can help me in his stead. My friend wants to auction an object. Please help him to identify the object and then add it to the auction list. We can combine it to the auction later," Wurth instructed the old man before pointing at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nestor glanced at Zheng. He revealed a rather disapproving look when he found that a teenager of 16 or 17 stood before him. Nestor was the chief auctioneer of the Blessed Auction House. He had seen and identified many valuable or rare treasures and could not believe that such a young man could have any special treasure that would need his expertise.</p>

  <p>Nestor assumed that the young man needed Wurth's help as his object could not be very rare.</p>

  <p>Even though Nestor did not have any interest in helping Zheng, he did not want to reject Wurth, his young master's orders.</p>

  <p>As an experienced auctioneer, Nestor soon replaced the disapproval on his face with a professional expression and asked, "Yes, young master.</p>

  <p>And what does your friend want to auction? May I have a look?" Nestor turned to look at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed Nestor's attitude. He did not say anything. Instead, he took out the crystal core of fire scorpion lion from his space ring. He handed it to Nestor as if it were an ordinary object.</p>

  <p>Unlike Zheng's calm demeanor, when Nestor saw the crystal core of fire scorpion lion, his eyes widened. Next second, he narrowed his eyes and started to scrutinize the crystal core.</p>

  <p>Compared to Wurth's reaction, Nestor's reaction was much stronger.</p>

  <p>After all, Wurth was an heir of the family and was not a professional auctioneer. He only had superficial knowledge when it came to evaluating treasures.</p>

  <p>But Nestor was different. He became the chief auctioneer of the Blessed Auction House after having been in this industry for a lifetime. During this time, he had identified countless treasures of genius, magic weapons, and magical medicines.</p>

  <p>Hence, he only needed one glance to know the value of the crystal core of fire scorpion lion. It was definitely a priceless and rare treasure!</p>

  <p>"Nestor, what do you think of this crystal core?" Wurth asked. Even though he knew the value of the object, he wanted to confirm with Nestor, the most experienced auctioneer in the Blessed Auction House.</p>

  <p>"This is the crystal core of an adult fire scorpion lion. This fire scorpion lion would be around 30 feet high and 60 feet long. Such a big fire scorpion lion hasn't appeared for many years. So, this crystal core is valuable enough to be used as the final and best treasure during the auction!" Unlike his indifference at the beginning, Nestor was now very excited. His shrewd, little eyes were full of astonishment and happiness.</p>

  <p>On hearing Nestor's description, Zheng admired the man. Nestor had indeed been correct. The height of that Fire Scorpion Lion was exactly like what Nestor had said, about 30 feet. The fact that he could draw such a conclusion only by looking at the crystal core was enough to show that Nestor was experienced and had sharp eyes.</p>

  <p>"What kind of basic price do you think we can set for this crystal core?"</p>

  <p>Wurth asked.</p>

  <p>Nestor laughed loudly and said, "As with any exceptional treasure, when it appears in an auction, you never know how many people will rush and fight for it. Especially at this time when the Shura Battlefield is about to restart. The clans never feel like they have sufficient good weapons. And the crystal core of fire scorpion lion is a superior material for refining weapons. Based on this information, it is hard to estimate the final price of this crystal core. If we have to set a basic price for it, I think about thirty thousand cubic crystals is appropriate."</p>

  <p>"Thirty thousand cubic crystals!" Zheng was surprised to hear the price and could not help crying out in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Zheng's reaction took Nestor and Wurth by surprise. They looked at each other before Wurth turned to Zheng and asked, "Zheng, do you think the basic price is too low? Rest assured. Once the auction starts, the final price would be much higher than this number."</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and explained, "No. Wurth, you have misunderstood me. The price is very appropriate!"</p>
