<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since each of the low-rank True Gods had only comprehended the first two levels of a Godly Way, their internal momentum was not complete.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng couldn't contain his excitement.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of Godly Ways from these low-rank True Gods couldn't light up the Godly Way Tablets in Zheng's mind. However, it could light up the scales on the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>"The Infinity Ruler!"</p>

  <p>The edge of Zheng's eyes began to flicker with a faint golden light.</p>

  <p>Trying hard to absorb the internal momentum, Zheng failed.</p>

  <p>"Why can't I absorb the internal momentum of these low-rank True Gods?" Zheng wondered, narrowing his eyes.</p>

  <p>This place might be a huge illusion, and for some reason, it seemed like the Infinity Ruler was unable to absorb the internal momentum in the illusion.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried hard to think about this, while the low-rank True Gods started displaying all kinds of theurgies.</p>

  <p>In fact, the joint power of a thousand low-rank True Gods was undoubtedly extraordinary. Focusing on dealing with them, Zheng dared not let his guard down. He might appear to be outnumbered but his skills would have things in his favor.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Zheng finally killed every low-rank True God who attacked him.</p>

  <p>It was a test which was indeed very difficult for ordinary consummate True Gods to accomplish.</p>

  <p>Bearing the impact of the Memory Flames would make them under great pressure.</p>

  <p>Even the most powerful consummate True Gods, like Troy and Rachelle, would find it difficult. Death would dawn upon them if they were not cautious enough.</p>

  <p>But it was another story for Zheng. He didn't find any difficulty in the task at all.</p>

  <p>The more rounds he experienced, the more relaxed Zheng became.</p>

  <p>In the last round, he was able to take out three consummate True Gods on his own in just a minute.</p>

  <p>"Quack! Quack! Quack!"</p>

  <p>After Zheng passed the last test, the Magical Crow fluttered its wings and jumped down from the sky towards him.</p>

  <p>"With imperial-grade bloodline, you are really so powerful," the Magical Crow said in a sharp voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly and then asked, "After passing the test, can I rule the Reincarnation Land?"</p>

  <p>"Come with me."</p>

  <p>Flying to the other side of the space, the Magical Crow flapped its wings and circled along the edge.</p>

  <p>On the edge of the space appeared some straight lines, which were connected to each other to form a small pyramid. In the middle of the pyramid, there was a small eye.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>After the pyramid appeared, it flew straight towards Zheng and floated in front of him.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" It was the first time that he had seen this fist-sized pyramid.</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Soul Weapon. You will be able to rule the Reincarnation Land if you refine it," the Magical Crow screeched.</p>

  <p>The Magical Crow's answer confused Zheng so he clarified, "Can I refine the Reincarnation Soul Weapon? But the hall soul said that I couldn't use it."</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Soul Weapon is of great importance. Since your blood isn't pure, you can't use it. But if you can refine it, you will be able to control the Reincarnation Land," the Magical Crow replied.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Soul Weapon could make the creatures of the entire divine land reincarnate and trace their memories back to any lifetime.</p>

  <p>Chiyou had set up so many restrictions for safety.</p>

  <p>Even if the outsiders, like Gregorio, had gotten the Stone Mouse, they would not be able to take the test.</p>

  <p>Even if they took the Reincarnation Soul Weapon and took control of the Reincarnation Land, people with impure blood, like Zheng, wouldn't be able to reincarnate all the creatures in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Zheng stared at the Magical Crow and asked, "You've been here for so many years. Do you want to go out with me?"</p>

  <p>In Zheng's opinion, the Magical Crow, as Chiyou's pet, could do something for the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Quack! Quack!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, the Magical Crow said in a serious tone, "On behalf of the Grand Chieftain, I have to test all the arrivals here, so I cannot leave at will. If..."</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled his eyes at the Magical Crow's long speech. It was obvious that it had known about the crisis in the divine land, so it hid here as a coward.</p>

  <p>Zheng simply grabbed the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, turned around and left. He should find a quiet place to refine the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>When Zheng returned from the Reincarnation Hall, the huge door opened with a gentle push.</p>

  <p>After opening the door, Zheng condensed a fire bead, illuminating the Reincarnation Land as if it was in daylight.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a look and saw that Leland and the others were still lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>Since he already killed the big mice, they wouldn't have any other danger, so Zheng decided to just let them take a rest.</p>

  <p>He sat cross-legged, putting the Reincarnation Soul Weapon in front of his belly.</p>

  <p>The process of refining the Reincarnation Soul Weapon was somewhat special. The first step was still to prove his blood.</p>

  <p>Zheng made a small cut on his finger, and a drop of golden blood dripped into the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>The blood spread out from the triangular top and flowed along the lines on the surface of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>But no matter how the blood flowed, it failed to flow into the eye of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>This was one of the disadvantages of the impure blood. Otherwise, controlling the Reincarnation Soul Weapon would be so easy.</p>

  <p>Putting his two thumbs on his temples, Zheng closed his eyes slowly.</p>

  <p>In no time, a wisp of his soul quietly came out from his forehead and circled around in the air before entering the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng's soul entered the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, his body shook and he opened his eyes in a flash, looking surprised.</p>

  <p>Soon his body was connected with the Reincarnation Soul Weapon and thus with the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>"This is..." Suddenly, a number appeared in Zheng's mind. "The number of Memory Flames is actually 77 million quadrillion!"</p>

  <p>One thousand billion was a trillion, and one thousand trillion was a quadrillion.</p>

  <p>77 million quadrillion...</p>

  <p>There were actually so many Memory Flames in the divine land!</p>

  <p>Subconsciously looking at the sea of Memory Flames, Zheng confirmed the number of Memory Flames was beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>"That is because of the rule of reincarnation. The creatures will leave Memory Flames every time they die. Just imagine how many creatures have been born in so many years! The total number is simply unimaginable."</p>

  <p>"So what's Gregorio's identity after his recent reincarnation?"</p>

  <p>Zheng began to carefully search among the Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>When he had found Gregorio, his eyes flashed. Then, he jumped up and flew over onto the opposite step.</p>

  <p>In the face of the sea of Memory Flames, a thought flashed in Zheng's mind. In the depths of the sea, an extremely bright Memory Flame rapidly danced.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flames of Holy Beings were far brighter than those of ordinary people. This pale yellow Memory Flame belonged to Gregorio.</p>

  <p>In the sea of Memory Flames, there were not many such bright Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>Without much hesitation, Zheng began to read the memories in the Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>After he controlled the Reincarnation Land, he could search any Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, all the creatures in the divine land were unable to keep secrets from Zheng.</p>

  <p>A moment later, retreating from the Memory Flame, Zheng murmured, "It's actually him! I'm afraid that even Nicholas doesn't expect that after Gregorio was reincarnated, he gave himself a different surname and has become a Holy Being again."</p>
