<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was no guarantee that this ancient jade would be of any use, but Luo Zheng would take any chance he could get. He was a desperate man clutching at straws.</p>

  <p>There was only one way to find out if it could heal Ning Yudie. At the very least, he would be able to feel the life energy within this ancient jade.</p>

  <p>He had no more time to waste. Ning Yudie, who used to be full of life energy, was quickly wasting away. The Life and Death Wind had all but depleted her life energy. Luo Zheng didn't know how much longer she could last, and he prayed silently that she would be able to absorb the life energy inside the jade.</p>

  <p>He led the beggar into the room where Ning Yudie was. Then, extending his hand, Luo Zheng said coldly, "Hand it over."</p>

  <p>The beggar took a step back in surprise and curled into a defensive stance.</p>

  <p>"If it's effective, then the rewards..." he demanded, looking at Luo Zheng and maintaining his careful pose.</p>

  <p>"You will be compensated well, as long as it works," Luo Zheng replied impatiently.</p>

  <p>However, the beggar shook his head at this and said, "The things you are offering are of no use to me. I am only a warrior at the nature level." He paused before continuing, "I want to join the Cloud Hall or the World Commercial Alliance instead."</p>

  <p>Zheng's patience was wearing thin. He had no time for this beggar's demands.</p>

  <p>Throwing a sharp glance at him, he answered, "If the jade works, I can help you. So stop with the demands and give me the jade."</p>

  <p>In the world of warriors, there was only one thing that mattered— strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could easily snatch the jade from the beggar. He could even kill him to make sure his mouth was kept shut. That was what many others would do.</p>

  <p>But not Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The beggar of course understood this. As a warrior of the Central Region, he knew how the rules worked. The moment he had chosen to present the treasure, he had already decided to gamble.</p>

  <p>The man before him seemed to be one to keep his word. Nodding to Luo Zheng, he handed him the ancient jade.</p>

  <p>As the jade touched his hand, Luo Zheng felt a warm sensation. It was unlike the characteristic coldness one would normally find in a piece of ordinary jade.</p>

  <p>Was it because of the life energy within it? Or was it because the beggar had kept it close to his body?</p>

  <p>But now was not the time to wonder. There was a far more serious situation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked towards Ning Yudie, but hesitated when he was right in front of her.</p>

  <p>How was he going to transfer its life energy into her body?</p>

  <p>The beggar noticed Zheng's conflicted expression. He explained, "My ancestors said that these kinds of ancient jade could only be used after being crushed. Once they are crushed, the life energy within them will automatically dissipate."</p>

  <p>'There is more than a piece of ancient jade?'</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat as he caught on the connotation of the beggar's words. He glanced at the beggar. This guy was no fool. He probably didn't bring all the pieces of ancient jade he had.</p>

  <p>But first, he had to see if it was useful. Luo Zheng placed the ancient jade above Ning Yudie and crushed it with his fingers. Cracks appeared on its surface, a translucent light emitting from the cracks.</p>

  <p>'The life energy!' he thought to himself. He kept a close watch on Ning Yudie. It was too early to rejoice. He didn't know whether she would be able to absorb the life energy or not. He watched her face for any sign of change, his breath caught in his throat.</p>

  <p>This life energy inside the ancient jade was indeed quite strange. After the light broke out from it, it started to go towards his own hand. Luo Zheng hurriedly retracted his hand, fearing that he would absorb the energy instead of Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>She needed it now more than ever.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng removed his hand, the life energy hovered above Yudie's unconscious form, and then pierced into her body.</p>

  <p>"Is it working?" Zheng's eyelids twitched as he watched the light disappear inside her.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng sensed Yudie's Mu Ning grow stronger. His own pulse quickened as he felt her energy. It was just a sliver, but to Luo Zheng, it was a great hope. The ancient jade had worked!</p>

  <p>It was able to replenish Yudie's life energy.</p>

  <p>With this realization, Luo Zheng turned his head to the beggar. His eyes bored through him as he asked, "How many pieces of ancient jade do you have?"</p>

  <p>At his question, the beggar looked nervous and fidgeted. "I...I have..."</p>

  <p>It was true that he still had other pieces of ancient jade— he actually still had seven remaining. The beggar was Hanson Li. In the old times, the Li Clan was also among the ranks of third-grade clans, but it faced a tragic decline in its warriors. Three hundred years ago, the clan fell and no one was able to revive it.</p>

  <p>However, from the ruins of the clan, the eight pieces of ancient jade had survived and had been preserved to this day. They were the Li Clan's most precious treasures. No one in the clan had ever thought of using them.</p>

  <p>Then came the announcement from the World Commercial Alliance that anyone who managed to save Ning Yudie would be rewarded greatly. Hanson Li had caught word of this. The announcement already mentioned of something that had to do with life energy. Taking the jade, he went forward and tried his luck. The Li Clan had already been buried in the dust of the past, but he might be able to change his future.</p>

  <p>According to the old records of his clan, the ancient jade contained life energy, and from what he had seen just now, it seemed that it was indeed useful.</p>

  <p>Hanson Li was no fool. He knew that if he were to take all the pieces of ancient jade and give them all at once, he would not be able to make the most use out of them. There were also plenty of stronger warriors than him.</p>

  <p>If they were to snatch away the jade, all his hopes would be gone.</p>
