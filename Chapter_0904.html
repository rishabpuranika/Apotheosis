<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 904 The Bull-like Giant Toad (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Per chance, Fabian remembered that there was a forbidden area in the west of this area.</p>

  <p>The creatures who shared the Tower of Sin had constantly been drawing a map according to each's experiences in exploring the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>The map was shared among all the races. Of course, there were some creatures who were not willing to share some of their fortunes or opportunities with the others and neglected to mark these on the map. They would not even tell the members of their own race.</p>

  <p>However, most races were quite generous when it came to informing others of areas of danger. After all, if one was able to mark out an additional forbidden area on the map, the others would have a better chance of survival.</p>

  <p>However, these dangers and forbidden areas were constantly changing. For example, if there was a ferocious monster lurking somewhere in the outer area, then it was very likely that by the next year, the monster would have moved its location so that the map would become inaccurate.</p>

  <p>It was rumored there was a Bull-like Giant Toad in the forbidden area to the west.</p>

  <p>That Bull-like Giant Toad had been there for a long time. While many races had ventured into that forbidden area, they had all been swept away by the Bull-like Giant Toad's huge tongue. From then on, none of the warriors that entered the Dark Nether Cave dared to approach that forbidden area.</p>

  <p>Given the Bull-like Giant Toad's strength, none of the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, not to mention a war sage or a top-level war lord, dared to antagonize the beast as they were not able to deal with it.</p>

  <p>On any normal given day, Fabian wouldn't have gone there, even if he was threatened with being beaten to death. Only hours earlier, he had safely guided everyone around the territory of the Bull-like Giant Toad, but now, he had no choice except to go there with these strange birds in tow.</p>

  <p>If they stayed here, they would surely die. But if they took the birds there, there might be a slim chance of surviving.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Many top-level war lords, including Zheng, had all transformed into streams of light and swiftly advanced, following behind Fabian.</p>

  <p>As for the over a thousand Swallowing Birds in the sky, they chased closely behind, occasionally diving down to snatch at their prey.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh..."</p>

  <p>As they made their way, another human war general was snatched up by a bird when he was unable to dodge in time.</p>

  <p>"Kid!" one of the top-level war lords roared. However, he could not turn his head to look or try to save him. Behind him flocked countless birds. As soon as he turned his head back, he would be eaten by them. He would die a savage death of dismemberment.</p>

  <p>The war general who had just been devoured by the birds was also a divine-level talent, inferior only to Dylon and Olivia. This time, when they had entered the Dark Nether Cave, Dylon and Olivia didn't get a license, but instead this kid had followed them in. He was the nephew of the top-level war lord. Clearly he had thought that simply wandering the outer area of the Dark Nether Cave while following behind his uncle wouldn't be too dangerous.</p>

  <p>But this time, given the level of danger, everyone was too busy taking care of themselves. How could they take care of this war general?</p>

  <p>While everyone was rushing forward, they suddenly heard and felt the reverberation of a strong sound wave.</p>

  <p>"Croak!"</p>

  <p>The sound wave was very deep and powerful. When it rang out, it immediately caused many of the nearby trees to shake and fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>Caught off-guard, war lords who were not at the top level, and even some of the top-level war lords failed to protect their ears. Their eardrums were immediately ruptured by the terrifying sound waves, and blood flowed out from their ears while they cried out in pain, holding their heads.</p>

  <p>"Cover your ears! Don't get your ears damaged by the shock wave of the Bull-like Giant Toad!" Fabian shouted.</p>

  <p>"Fuck! Fabian Zhao, why didn't you fucking say so earlier?" someone cursed angrily.</p>

  <p>Instantly, everyone used their life vitality to protect their own ears, as they saw that the trees in front of them were once again being bent over, as the invisible sound wave was made visible by the damage that preceded it.</p>

  <p>"Croak!"</p>

  <p>Even though they took steps to protect their ears, the extremely terrifying sound still reached their hearing, shocking everyone's minds. However, with everyone's cultivation stages being advanced enough, they were able to protect themselves from further harm.</p>

  <p>But at the same time, they were all deeply worried.</p>

  <p>The Bull-like Giant Toad was truly a monster! Just its cry alone was already so terrifying. So how powerful was the Bull-like Giant Toad really?</p>

  <p>Was it really a good idea for everyone to charge at the Bull-like Giant Toad in order to avoid the birds in the sky? Were they not merely going to make a bad situation worse?</p>

  <p>Whether it was a good idea or a bad one, they had no other choice now.</p>

  <p>They could only charge forward. The strange birds' speed was much faster than that of most of the top-level war lords. At this point, they all ran as fast as they could. Their hearts were beating in their chests, whether from physical exertion or fear made no difference.</p>

  <p>"Quack, quack, quack..."</p>

  <p>The sound waves being emitted by the Bull-like Giant Toad had spread out in all directions, and those birds in the sky were obviously affected as well.</p>

  <p>They seemed to hesitate momentarily before they continued flying closer.</p>

  <p>At this point, the flock of birds had almost reached the sky above the humans. If they were to dive down now, they would be able to cut off their path.</p>
