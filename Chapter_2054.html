<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2054 Trapped (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Of course, most of the Sacred Supreme Lords stayed calm and composed?</p>

  <p>"Don't panic," Supreme Lord Denzel calmly said. His tone was gentle yet full of authority.</p>

  <p>"Humph, although I don't know what sort of method they used, it won't be easy to take us down either." Supreme Lord Irvin, who was on the other side, looked sullen. He was one of the most bloodthirsty Supreme Lords of the Sacred race, and he was already ready to fight. Murderous Mu Ning radiated from him.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Palmere was the calmest of the Supreme Lords. "We might not have to fight to death with them. Our Grand Supreme Lord must have known about this. We just need to resist for a while before he comes. Just buy some time until our reinforcements arrive..."</p>

  <p>Amongst all the Supreme Lords, Supreme Lord Palmere's analysis was the most accurate. His tone was calm and tranquil.</p>

  <p>Wynn had used the Star Sealing Technique and the Dark Star to completely block the passage to the Sighing Wall. However, it wouldn't last long. The Supreme Lords he trapped only needed to survive for a short time and wait for the Sacred race to break through the passage again. The reinforcements of the Sacred race would eventually come and rescue them.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Palmere's words received the vast majority of the Supreme Lords' approval! Their panic faded as they had a clear solution to their problem.</p>

  <p>"Let me see if you can survive until then!"</p>

  <p>A mysterious and powerful voice rang out! Then, not too far away from the Sacred Supreme Lords, an orderly Space Law burst out. The Space Law drew out a blazing white line and two vertical lines in the air.</p>

  <p>Afterward, a square door was formed!</p>

  <p>The door opened, and an old man suddenly appeared in front of the Sacred Supreme Lords. The old man's Mu Ning radiated immense strength.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lords used the Grand Teleportation, they needed to tear open space. In this process, the power of the Space Law would often leak out and formed irregular space windstorms?</p>

  <p>However, when this old man had used Grand Teleportation to reach here, the Space Law hadn't leaked in the slightest, nor had there been any space windstorms.</p>

  <p>In the Supreme Lords' eyes, that particular skill was so magical that it was almost unbelievable. Disbelief was reflected in their expressions.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Denzel saw the old man, his eyes widened slightly.</p>

  <p>"It's the True God of the Celestial Position!" His voice was full of surprise and alertness.</p>

  <p>Several years ago, Maha had once come to the Celestial Position. Several Supreme Lords accompanied Maha and had seen Wynn. Naturally, they were able to recognize Wynn!</p>

  <p>Since the Evolutionary Universe had already launched its general offensive, their True God would naturally take action as well. Powerful warriors would start to move in the war.</p>

  <p>"So what if he's a True God? Such a title means nothing in this war! He will still be torn apart by me!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Irvin coldly snorted as all the bones in his body began to produce explosive sounds. Instantly, his body swelled up to seven or eight times. It made him look like a formidable giant. At the same time, an intense murderous intent spread out from his body.</p>

  <p>Although Supreme Lord Irvin was only a mid-rank Supreme Lord, in terms of carnage, he was even scarier than a top-rank Supreme Lord. His thirst for blood was unparalleled.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destiny of Seven Killings he carried was also a murderous way created by Murphy, which was called the Seven Killings Way. That particular Heavenly Destiny was very lethal.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the divine land had created several large systems.</p>

  <p>They had the most thorough insights and the best comprehension into the divine land. Although the Seven Killings Way was not a Godly Way, there were still many True Gods that cultivated it. Its practical uses in a battle were significantly impressive.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Irvin directly carried the Heavenly Destiny of Seven Killings. That particular Heavenly Destiny was originally Murphy's own comprehension, so the power that Supreme Lord Irvin displayed was extremely horrendous!</p>

  <p>The Seven Killings were the killings of the unfaithful, the unrighteous, the unfilial, the heartless, the discourteous, the unwise, and the disloyal.</p>

  <p>That cultivation method was very bloodthirsty and dangerous. However, it was a unique way of its own.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Supreme Lord Irvin had already turned into a god of death and dashed towards Wynn. A murderous Mu Ning radiated from him.</p>

  <p>Normal Supreme Lords would feel quite a bit of pressure when they faced a True God. After all, a True God was a whole level higher than a Supreme Lord. The difference in strength was not small. It could not easily be overcome.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Irvin had activated the Seven Killings Way. His entire body had been dominated by slaughter, without the slightest hint of emotion. From this point of view, the Seven Killings Way was actually very similar to the Emotion Closing Godly Way. The only difference was that the Seven Killings Way wasn't a Godly Way. It was not as powerful as the Emotion Closing Godly Way, nor was it viewed as a forbidden way within the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Huff?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Irvin charged at Wynn with incredible momentum. Rage and ferocity were in his eyes. However, Wynn's expression remained incomparably calm.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Wynn casually waved his hand. Suddenly, a handful of faint starlight appeared in his hand. The dots of starlight were like tiny fireflies that flew towards Supreme Lord Irvin immediately after they appeared?</p>

  <p>The faint starlight was ignored by Supreme Lord Irvin. Barbarity had clouded his judgment. He didn't even have any intention to dodge it.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the dots of dim starlight touched Supreme Lord Irvin, they turned into balls of light the size of a fist. Power immediately radiated from each of the dots?</p>

  <p>The balls of light exploded at the chest of Supreme Lord Irvin with destructive intensity. The moment they exploded, the balls of light had thoroughly destroyed Supreme Lord Irvin's body. When he arrived in front of Wynn, Supreme Lord Irvin's entire body had been already broken into two pieces by the starlight. The cinnabar field in his belly had been utterly obliterated.</p>
