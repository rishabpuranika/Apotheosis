<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>But the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings stated that it was forbidden for a Holy Being to destroy the inner world of another Holy Being. Without such a rule, the war between Holy Beings would fall into a viscous cycle.</p>

  <p>The final result, at best, would be both sides suffering great losses.</p>

  <p>However, a Holy Being had the permission to start a war between two universes. A Holy Being could make the secondary creatures within their inner world invade the inner world of another Holy Being. But they too had to follow a set of very strict rules. A Holy Being was only allowed to send one True God in to help with a war, and the True God could only be of low-rank.</p>

  <p>Once Mike escaped, with severe wounds of course, he had made full preparations. Not only had he arranged one of his disciples within his universe, but he had also made his universe last forever. The other Holy Beings were all amazed by him achieving such a technique. As long as the Evolutionary Universe remained untouched, he'd still have a chance at returning.</p>

  <p>That didn't matter much anymore, though. Not long ago, this rule was changed. The number of low-rank True Gods that a Holy Being could send to war between universes had increased from one to three.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that this change had been made as a direct strike at Mike.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings originally had great enmity with Mike. Even if a few of the Holy Beings wanted to speak for Mike, they wouldn't be able to do anything. They could only watch what happened in the Evolutionary Universe helplessly.</p>

  <p>Most of the Holy Beings knew very well that the Evolutionary Universe would eventually collapse. When was impossible to tell. When the time came though, one thing was for certain, Mike would perish!</p>

  <p>Other Holy Beings felt very indifferent to this matter. After all, it had nothing to do with them and it was as simple as that.</p>

  <p>And others still were actually secretly relieved. Mike living, even for one more day, was pure torture to them. They would only ever feel at ease anew once Mike was dead.</p>

  <p>The speed at which Zheng brandished his Great Weighty Sword was getting slower and losing momentum.</p>

  <p>Pranav's small five-colored swords were too sharp, and his attacker was too quick. Beneath the continuous stabbing, Zheng was losing more and more of his blood.</p>

  <p>In the face of a True God, all of Zheng's methods were rendered absolutely useless.</p>

  <p>He had once employed the Eight Smoky Melodies, but it was now impossible for him to dodge these sharp small swords. Furthermore, the Causality Breaking Light of the Enemy Repelling Arts had no effect on the Five Elements Godly Way, and thus, he found himself in an utterly passive position. All Zheng felt he could do now was to leave himself at the mercy of Pranav.</p>

  <p>Worse, the sudden appearance of the two True Gods caused Zheng's heart to sink way down into his depths.</p>

  <p>Wynn was feeling nearly the same way as Zheng.</p>

  <p>If it was just for dealing with Pranav alone, the Evolutionary Universe would have been capable of contending against the Murphy Universe, and their chances of winning would have been quite high.</p>

  <p>However, Murphy had actually sent out three True Gods to fight the war.</p>

  <p>This placed the Murphy Universe in an invincible position!</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to end that kid's life?" Marko chimed back in.</p>

  <p>"Is it really that rewarding to torture a small, helpless world lord?"</p>

  <p>"Pranav, I never expected you to have such a nasty hobby…"</p>

  <p>Although Marko had come to help the Murphy Universe, he didn't have any plans of physically taking action. So much so that there were even a few Sacred Supreme Lords that died not too far off, and he still ignored them, continuing to nag at Pranav instead.</p>

  <p>"Shut your stinking mouth!" Pranav reprimanded with fury.</p>

  <p>He was also beginning to feel that the war was coming to an end. His figure flashed and in the blink of an eye, he appeared above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the power of Zheng's Nine Divine Stars had almost completely been exhausted. There was nearly nothing left at all.</p>

  <p>Even though he had exerted the Wishing Spell, he didn't have the strength to counterattack once again. Now, he was struggling even more to keep control of the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>He mechanically brandished his Great Weighty Sword forward. These weak strikes didn't muster the slightest ounce of power. Pranav simply extended his hand and tapped lightly on the Great Weighty Sword. Zheng's sword was flung hundreds of feet away and there was nothing he could do about it.</p>

  <p>"Give up, boy! Your performance really impressed me. You don't even have the Heavenly Destiny, and yet you managed to cut off one of my arms," Pranav said flatly.</p>

  <p>"What? This brat cut off your arm?!" Marko, who was standing to the side and watching, was also stunned.</p>

  <p>Pranav ignored Marko and continued speaking to Zheng in a condescending tone, "You're a secondary creature, thus you're born with a lowly life. You're doomed to being restricted by the heavens. No matter how talented you are, how strong your willpower is, the only thing you'll chase after in your entire life is nothing but a joke in my eyes. Kneel down, and I will grant you a dignified death!"</p>

  <p>Once Pranav finished speaking, Zheng revealed a dry smile.</p>

  <p>Upon Zheng's eerie smile, Pranav was overwhelmed with a strange feeling, one that made his heart pound. Clearly this world lord was already in a bad position. What in the hell could he be trying to say with such an expression on his face now?</p>

  <p>"Are you qualified to grant me with my death?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>And once these words escaped his mouth, Zheng suddenly disappeared, vanishing completely like a miracle, right before Pranav's and the other True God's eyes.</p>
