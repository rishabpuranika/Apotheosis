  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's head remained latched onto Lamont's hand as if he was biting into it.</p>

  <p>Then, Lamont raised his arm and lifted Luo Zheng's body with it.</p>

  <p>"Let go of me, you bastard!"</p>

  <p>Lamont swiftly swung his arm sideways in an attempt to throw Luo Zheng into the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng remained firmly latched onto his hand. Even though Lamont was knowledgeable and powerful, a strong sensation of anxiety and vexation was creeping beneath his skin.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng wouldn't let go, Lamont raised him high in the sky and smashed him down to the mountain.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Lamont didn't feel that Luo Zheng was loosening his grip, so he smashed him again and again.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, several craters appeared on the top area of Li Shan mountain where Lamont repeatedly smashed Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>However, even though Lamont felt that he almost used up all his strength, his hand was still unable to get rid of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yan grew worried and speechless as she saw her brother being beaten so furiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng seemed to withstand all of Lamont's attacks, but it wouldn't be good for him to be continuously beaten like this.</p>

  <p>Crash! Crash! Crash!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was still being rammed into the Li Shan mountain, a huge stone about ten feet wide flew towards the side and almost hit King Ieuan, who had just climbed out of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Before the huge chunk of stone hit King Ieuan, its tail whipped the stone at high speed, splitting it into two halves.</p>

  <p>The other Ear Mice also followed King Ieuan and had a clear view of the brutal battle between Lamont and Luo Zheng. However, as they watched intently, there was a strange sensation that they couldn't shake off.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a dear friend of the Ear Mouse race. All of the members present, including King Ieuan, knew all of the miraculous things that he did in the past.</p>

  <p>They never even thought that Luo Zheng could already fight the Chaos Ancient God after he got out of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what's happening. Luo Zheng's current state is pretty strange.</p>

  <p>He seems to be seriously injured now, but he can still latch onto Lamont," an Ear Mouse told its observation.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan nodded at the Ear Mouse's statement and stared at Luo Zheng with its soybean-sized eyes. "His body has indeed become very strange. I don't think he is injured. It's as if his body voluntarily became like this..."</p>

  <p>"Does that mean that his bloodline affects his physical body this way?" one of the Ear Mice blurted as it was lost in thought. Actually, it was not that unusual for an Eternal Realm warrior to obtain some kind of bloodline that could alter their physical body.</p>

  <p>However, King Ieuan explained further, "That's not exactly the point. Did you notice that for a while now, Lamont hasn't used his bloodline power?</p>

  <p>That's the most exceptional thing so far! Luo Zheng might've done something that we couldn't comprehend."</p>

  <p>The greatest reliance of Chaos Ancient Gods was their bloodline power, which was known as the truth-level token. This was their basic foundation.</p>

  <p>However, when the power of truth became ineffective, they could only rely on their sturdy physical body.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>After launching several consecutive attacks, Lamont finally had enough of it. He grabbed the air with his other hand and summoned a huge ice blade that was formed by thick white mists.</p>

  <p>At the back of Lamont's mind, he thought that since Luo Zheng had degenerated into this pitiful form, it would be impossible for him to resist his power of truth again.</p>

  <p>As the ice blade slashed towards Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng's strange body didn't react to it and just continued latching himself on Lamont's hand.</p>

  <p>However, just as the ice blade was about to touch Luo Zheng, one of his hands quickly responded.</p>

  <p>It seemed to have an extreme ability of perception, like having an eye of its own. His hand accurately held off the sharp edge of the blade and the blade didn't even cut him.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the sharp ice blade melted completely.</p>

  <p>Then, his hand quickly went back.</p>

  <p>Lamont felt like he was going insane.</p>

  <p>He couldn't get rid of Luo Zheng or smash him to death. Moreover, his token was being completely suppressed. There was nothing left that he could do to beat him.</p>

  <p>The current situation was something new to Lamont and that was why he was very frustrated.</p>

  <p>Lamont never had the intention to take Luo Zheng seriously before, but now, he couldn't believe that he would become so troublesome.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is wrong with you? Why can't you die?"</p>

  <p>Lamont was so exasperated now. He wanted to finish this useless battle as soon as possible, so he began dragging Luo Zheng to a mountain nearby.</p>

  <p>The peak was like a sharp sword that was soaring into the sky. It turned out to be the Sword Blade Peak, which was apparently guarded by the mountain leader, Dwight Xu.</p>

  <p>While on the mountain, Dwight Xu was also silently observing the vicious battle between Luo Zheng and Lamont. Upon seeing that the two were headed towards the mountain, he immediately gave an order to all the disciples stationed there.</p>

  <p>"All disciples must retreat from the Sword Blade Peak at once!"</p>

  <p>There were several mountains around the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>In previous battles, the disciples in the mountains naturally felt their power.</p>

  <p>However, even if they tried their best to release their energy, the strong feeling of fear was still there.</p>

  <p>After all, it was a Chaos Ancient God that Luo Zheng was dealing with. If they were slightly affected, it might cost them their lives.</p>

  <p>Therefore, as soon as Dwight Xu gave the order to retreat, all the disciples hurriedly used the Grand Teleportation technique and dispersed in all directions.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, there were tens of thousands of people on the Sword Blade Peak, but now, it was completely empty.</p>

  <p>Lamont dashed in front of the Sword Blade Peak and stopped there. Then, he stretched his hand to pat the peak.</p>

  <p>Gradually, as Lamont continued to put his palm on the peak, the Sword Blade Peak became frozen solid and almost impregnable.</p>

  <p>Even Fuxi and the Snake Goddess would have a hard time destroying it.</p>

  <p>After freezing the peak, Lamont dragged Luo Zheng and made a giant leap into the sky.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing his course of action, King Ieuan, Yan, Dwight Xu, and the others immediately understood what he was trying to do.</p>

  <p>Lamont brought Luo Zheng up in the sky and wanted to impale him straight into the Sword Blade Peak.</p>

  <p>Right now, this was the best idea that Lamont had thought. He didn't have any other good way to kill Luo Zheng on his current state.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng might not be able to eliminate Lamont's power of truth, if his physical body fell down at high speed. He would be defeated once his body was successfully impaled through the Sword Blade Peak.</p>

  <p>However, just as Lamont aggressively dragged Luo Zheng up in the sky, one of Luo Zheng's arms suddenly stretched downward and extended as if it had lost all of its bones. It patted the Sword Blade Peak and injected a stream of green energy into it.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The Sword Blade Peak, which was frozen solid just seconds ago, instantly melted. Not only that, the surface of the mountain blossomed into what seemed to be a fairyland, full of various plants all around.</p>

  <p>Lamont's jaw dropped while he was still in midair. Obviously, he was shocked at what just happened.</p>

  <p>Even the others who saw the scene were utterly surprised.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what is this?"</p>

  <p>Yan couldn't believe her eyes. "Is this even a battle?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, a superior human being, and Lamont, a powerful Chaos Ancient God, were two of the most powerful beings in the entire chaos because of their abilities and strength.</p>

  <p>But right now, the battle between these two mighty beings was not making any sense.</p>

  <p>Lamont stayed in midair for a few more seconds, and then decided to go back down at the Sword Blade Peak. He patted the peak again and infused the power of truth into it.</p>

  <p>After quite some time, Lamont noticed that the Sword Blade Peak wasn't freezing.</p>

  <p>As he lowered his head, Lamont saw Luo Zheng's slender and boneless hand was also touching the mountain, countering the effect of his power of truth.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! What the hell!"</p>

  <p>In the distance, Dwight Xu couldn't help but burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan and the other Ear Mice on the other side of Li Shan mountain also laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>Even Yan temporarily forgot that her brother was in danger. She just couldn't believe that a vicious battle would turn into a comedy show.</p>

  <p>"You bastard!"</p>

  <p>Lamont felt that he was going crazy. His angry roar echoed throughout the entire Li Shan mountain.</p>
