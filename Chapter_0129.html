<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Finally, Jesse, the top-ranking outer disciple of Vulture Peak had failed.</p>

  <p>So far, Luo Zheng had bested four disciples of Vulture Peak and helped Drizzle Peak obtain an advantage.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Luo Zheng had just secured a huge win for Drizzle Peak, its outer disciples stood still like statues. None had thought that Luo Zheng would survive the Hoop. And yet, he stood at the edge of the battle ring, victorious. The situation was so astounding that it was beyond everyone's expectation. The shock was so great that they were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng won! Drizzle Peak won!"</p>

  <p>Nory was the first to regain his senses. As the realization hit him, Nory shouted with glee.</p>

  <p>Then countless voices chimed in.</p>

  <p>At last, all of the outer disciples of Drizzle Peak began to chant loudly.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>They roared, whistled, and waved their hands.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face flushed. He had been so focused on surviving the battle that he hadn't noticed that he was standing at the edge of the arena, naked.</p>

  <p>Although all the disciples at Drizzle Peak were male, Luo Zheng felt embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Sean noticed Zheng's awkward expression. Quickly he removed his outer robe and threw it to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng covered his body with the white robe and then walked out of the battle ring. Accompanied by Nory and Sean, he made his way toward Wurth.</p>

  <p>Although injured, Wurth had not left. He had stayed to watch the battle between Luo Zheng and Jesse.</p>

  <p>"Wurth, how do you feel now?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The fat on Wurth's face wobbled as the big man chuckled. His small eyes glinted with excitement.</p>

  <p>Soon after their acquaintance, Wurth had thought highly of Zheng's potential, which was one of the reasons why he had taken the initiative to be friends with Luo Zheng. Wurth had a keen sense of judging others' talents.</p>

  <p>However, Wurth didn't expect that Zheng's strength could rise so fast, just like a flying rocket!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was only at the marrow refining level, but he had defeated Jesse!</p>

  <p>What was more, Luo Zheng won the battle by surpassing Jesse's secret weapon.</p>

  <p>It was amazing!</p>

  <p>If Wurth's guess was right, Luo Zheng also had a secret weapon that he had not yet used. Because of this, Wurth was more awed by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You worry about my wounds? Haha. I am not even thinking about my injuries. I'm just happy with your performance!" Wurth laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>But then he gasped and clutched his chest when he felt the pain from his broken ribs.</p>

  <p>Other outer disciples of Drizzle Peak flocked toward the battle ring.</p>

  <p>They appeared joyful.</p>

  <p>If defeated, the outer disciples of Drizzle Peak stood to lose a month's supply of pills and elixirs. This victory by Luo Zheng had earned them the supply of elixirs and pills that would have gone to Vulture Peak. The disciples of Drizzle Peak were not celebrating this win because they had earned more supplies. The real highlight had been Zheng's perfect performance. He was the hero of Drizzle Peak!</p>

  <p>Not far away, Mia's face darkened.</p>

  <p>She clenched her teeth and said to Mu Ning, "Well, you can uncover your eyes. That kid has put on clothes."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning pulled her hands off her face and said with a sly smile, "Mia, I'm sorry!"</p>

  <p>"What good is an apology? Vulture Peak has been defeated. We've lost a month's supply of pills and money. While that is not a big deal, Jesse, who is my best outer disciple, has been beaten by a little guy at the marrow refining level. It is a big blow for him," said Mia, sounding depressed.</p>

  <p>Since Jesse was one of her key disciples, Mia certainly felt upset.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng had defeated Jesse, Mia worried that his confidence in his martial arts cultivation would be destroyed. The speed of his progress would also slow down.</p>

  <p>With a serious expression, Mu Ning said, "While on the road of cultivating martial arts, we all run into strong enemies. If his confidence is damaged so easily, he is too self-conceited. We all know that failure is the mother of success. isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Aura's words, Mia didn't contradict her.</p>

  <p>Mia agreed with Mu Ning. The core of martial arts cultivation was to promote determination. Otherwise, if a refiner never suffered any challenges, the first obstacle would result in complete demotivation and the inability to work toward a higher level.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, those who suffered failures but still desperately forged ahead were more likely to attain success.</p>

  <p>However, Aura's remark sounded like she was showing off.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Mia was still unhappy, Mu Ning comforted her with a smile,</p>

  <p>"Well, Mia. I will compensate you in the future!"</p>

  <p>Mia pouted. Considering Master Su's background, she had no choice but to accept Aura's offer. On the other hand, Mia thought that letting Mu Ning owe her a favor was good compensation.</p>

  <p>That night, all outer disciples of Drizzle Peak were very excited.</p>

  <p>Everyone talked with great relish about Zheng's performance in the battle ring.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was not that excited. In contrast, he concerned himself with another matter.</p>

  <p>After returning to his residence, Luo Zheng took out a pile of crystal cores from his space ring. He intended to visit Master Su in the morning to ask her to change the crystal cores into points so that he could go to Hell Mountain.</p>
