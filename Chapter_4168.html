  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even the biggest Source World was but an island in the huge ocean that was the chaos.</p>

  <p>They were definitely not on the same level.</p>

  <p>What would it be like to expand the primitive land to such a massive size as the chaos?</p>

  <p>What kind of power would the ruler of this primitive land possess?</p>

  <p>"Previously, these secondary worlds could also be considered a type of downgrading, but they could not be considered perfect? a kind of 'pseudo downgrading', if you will," the ancestry-level bloodline explained.</p>

  <p>"Through complicated methods, the secondary worlds could be reversed and restored to the main world."</p>

  <p>"So it was possible to reverse secondary worlds..." Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the ancestry-level bloodline said. "However, if the Snake Masters unify the whole chaos and complete the downgrade, then there will be no turning back for the main world. By then, the entire main world will collapse, and the chaos will be able to expand indefinitely, occupying all the space of the main world."</p>

  <p>"Sounds good," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>As creatures living in the secondary world, the third-grade world was obviously more suitable for Zheng and the others. He had been at a loss in the higher-level Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>In other words, the creatures in the third-grade worlds and the four-grade worlds were against each other.</p>

  <p>"But the Snake Spirit King's goal is to return to the main world, right? Is he really going to ruin his plan by doing this?" Zheng asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"From the very beginning, the Snake Spirit King was wrong. He will definitely pay for his stubbornness," the ancestry-level bloodline replied.</p>

  <p>"Now, you must devour as many of these heads as you can so that you may expand your primitive land. Only by seizing this opportunity can you defeat the other party in the competition."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"I will help you."</p>

  <p>The edge of Zheng's primitive land suddenly cracked, forming a crack that was a thousand miles wide.</p>

  <p>As soon as the crack was formed, groups of heads started to chomp on it from the outside.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the heads started to bite down, countless bamboo shoots shot out from the crack and began to intertwine with each other.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The bamboo shoots rammed into the heads, chewing down on them till they were ground to pieces.</p>

  <p>"So, these are truly teeth?" Zheng's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the ancestry-level bloodline calmly.</p>

  <p>It had been preparing for this day ever since it entered Zheng's primitive land.</p>

  <p>Now that the heads had finally appeared, it was time for it to show what it was truly capable of.</p>

  <p>After the primitive land devoured the first batch of heads, Zheng suddenly felt his cinnabar field swelling slightly. He raised his eyebrows and asked,</p>

  <p>"Is the primitive land expanding again?"</p>

  <p>"The more heads it devours, the faster the expansion will be," the ancestry-level bloodline explained.</p>

  <p>As soon as it finished speaking, the crack at the edge of the primitive land once again opened, and a large group of heads rushed in eagerly.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't believe what was happening. In such a short period of time, the primitive land had expanded threefold!</p>

  <p>Zheng drew his gaze from the primitive land and looked at Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others. They were still trying their best to destroy those heads. Only then did Zheng understand what the ancestry-level bloodline meant: these heads were all his food, and his alone. It was really a waste to kill them like this.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept across the chaos, and at the same time, he used the mother butterfly to sense the location of his inner world. After a while, he said loudly, "You can't kill all these heads."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess made her shadow slash several heads into two pieces.</p>

  <p>"That's true, but we can't just sit still and wait for death," she said bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I have found another way," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's words made the others stop in their tracks. They all looked at him expectantly.</p>

  <p>With their combined strength, they could protect the Pear Hill for some time, perhaps days or maybe even weeks. But their bloodline power would eventually grow exhausted. The same went for the three Chaos Ancient Gods. It was only a matter of time before the Pear Hill was devoured.</p>

  <p>The people inside the Pear Hill knew this, and were now in a state of panic.</p>

  <p>No matter where they stood, they could see strange flying heads gnawing at their enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Even the citizens of the large cities were filled with uneasiness.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess then asked Zheng with narrowed eyes, "What way?"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't reply right away, as he did a rough calculation inwardly.</p>

  <p>Finally, he said, "Try your best to draw the heads to the west."</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng's primitive land was right in the west of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>After having flown in the chaos for so long, they were slowly closing the distance. They would meet each other in a day at most.</p>

  <p>"And then?" asked Fuxi, brows furrowed tightly.</p>

  <p>"Let the Pear Hill enter my primitive land," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>The several Eternal Realm warriors and three Chaos Ancient Gods were stunned.</p>

  <p>Kendrick asked, "Are you kidding? How could your inner world accommodate the Pear Hill?"</p>

  <p>Although the Pear Hill was a mountain, it was as big as a large province in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's primitive land had expanded, it was still incomparably small next to the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>"Has your primitive land expanded again? Can it accommodate the Pear Hill?" the Snake Goddess asked urgently.</p>

  <p>"No," Zheng said as he shook his head. "As of right now, it's only as big as one percent of the Pear Hill."</p>

  <p>"Then how could the Pear Hill possibly enter it?" Kendrick asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"My primitive land rapidly expands when it eats these heads," Zheng explained, pointing at the hungry heads in the sky. "If it can devour all of the heads, then accommodating the Pear Hill won't be a problem."</p>

  <p>"How does the primitive land swallow the heads?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked, still dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"Let me lure these heads to the west," the Snake Goddess said, ignoring him.</p>

  <p>At this point, they were out of ideas. Whether they liked it or not, they had no choice but to follow Zheng.</p>

  <p>With a gentle wave of the Snake Goddess's hand, the energy beams from her shadow became as thin as spider threads. In this way, her shadow could reach a farther distance.</p>

  <p>While multitudes of those strange heads kept chasing and intercepting the Pear Hill, there were countless more that hadn't even woken up yet.</p>

  <p>The thread-like energy beams floated past the motionless heads, immediately waking them up. Using their keen intuition, those newly-awakened heads locked in on the Pear Hill as their target.</p>

  <p>Originally, there were about three hundred thousand heads chasing after the Pear Hill, but after the energy beams spread out like a beacon, there were now over a million heads chasing after them.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was horrified when he saw how densely-packed the heads were, chomping on the enchanted barrier. He couldn't help but say, "Snake Goddess, your ability to lure them is so powerful..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess glanced at Zheng questioningly. Zheng said, "Don't stop.</p>

  <p>Lure in more of them."</p>

  <p>With a wave of the Snake Goddess's hands, her shadow extended even farther. More heads awoke and started to chase after the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>After a few hours, tens of millions of heads followed closely behind the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warriors and the three Chaos Ancient Gods present eyed them anxiously.</p>

  <p>If these heads caught up to the Pear Hill, they were done for.</p>
