  <p>Malachi glared at Luo Luo Zheng, his face sullen and furious as he tried to think of a way to deal with him.</p>

  <p>Based on his clansmen's predictions, the Illusion Battlefield's first stage would soon be ending.</p>

  <p>The first stage served to eliminate the majority of the warriors. Only 50 people per supreme world would most likely go on to the second stage.</p>

  <p>Since there were 50 supreme worlds, that would mean a total of 2, 500 people would advance.</p>

  <p>Among the trillions of warriors in this boundless universe, these 2, 500 could be considered as the elite among all Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>They were most likely descendants of world lords, children of Supreme Lords, ace talents, or Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>These predictions were based on the fragmented data collated from the last grand era.</p>

  <p>They were not a hundred percent accurate but were still more or less correct.</p>

  <p>Malachi had already known the existence of the cities, along with the Hall of Causality way before he entered the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>He had spent this entire time fighting and killing warriors on the battlefield every single day. He did not meet any mighty warriors that were his match. As a result, his ranking had climbed up steadily.</p>

  <p>He was now at the fourth rank of this supreme world, which was already more than enough for him to enter the second stage.</p>

  <p>He might go down a couple of places, but there was no way he would fall out of the top fifty.</p>

  <p>All he needed to do was choose a nice place in the city to spend the night in and wait for the second stage.</p>

  <p>However, his plan was immediately derailed upon the sudden changing of the Illusion Battlefield's rules. Nobody, not even his clansmen, could predict that the prohibition of killing within cities would be lifted. Maybe this fact was never recorded or perhaps their own records were incomplete.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he was truly regretting it now.</p>

  <p>If not for Hailey, then he never would've provoked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And now his spear was in his enemy's hands. How in the world was he supposed to fight him now?</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A bloody light shone from Malachi's space ring. Driven to an inescapable corner, he now brought out his last resort? his life's treasure, the Crane Crying Spear. This spear was a first-rank divine weapon considered as a rare treasure. However, it was still far inferior to the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>He knew he was no match for Luo Luo Zheng, but his pride as an ace talent forced him to push forward.</p>

  <p>There was still that tiny sliver of hope for victory if he gave it his all.</p>

  <p>"Dance of the Blood Crane!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>He raised his spear as beams of bloody light shot out and headed straight towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained calm as he activated the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>The sparring with the Supreme Lord Sword paid off since his understanding of swordsmanship had risen to a whole other level.</p>

  <p>His in-battle strategy was also enhanced. It was now easier for him to plan his course of action even during an actual battle.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng chose not to use his sword.</p>

  <p>Instead, he raised the spear he acquired from his opponent and raised it against him.</p>

  <p>He wasn't as good at using the spear as he was with the sword.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his current cultivation level allowed him to use anything and wield it effectively as a weapon. He could even pick up a branch or a random flower and use it in battle, so a spear wasn't going to be that difficult for him.</p>

  <p>Add to the fact that the Saint Killing Spear was an already exceptional weapon to begin with and Luo Luo Zheng was assured to be a mean, killing machine. However, as he held the spear, he couldn't help but notice that it seemed to pulse with some kind of hunger, as if it was desperately seeking for something only Luo Luo Zheng could provide.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>He didn't think there would be something so strange with this weapon when he first took it.</p>

  <p>The spear was alive!</p>

  <p>It felt like a starving man who hadn't had anything to eat or drink for three days and was hoping for Luo Luo Zheng to feed it.</p>

  <p>'The Saint Killing Spear has been possessed by the Demon Night queens.</p>

  <p>I guess the energy to activate it is not life vitality but Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>I don't have either, but I guess I could try with the chaotic energy, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng extracted a stream of chaotic energy from his body and allowed it to circulate through his meridians before pouring it into the spear.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The spear erupted with explosive sizzling sounds as Luo Luo Zheng infused the chaotic energy into it.</p>

  <p>As all this was happening, Malachi had already unleashed his spear lights. However, how could he ever hope to defeat Luo Luo Zheng so easily when the latter had already activated the Eight Smoky Melodies? Luo Luo Zheng successfully dodged Malachi's attacks every single time.</p>

  <p>Malachi couldn't help but be stunned when he heard the sizzling sounds erupt from the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?" he murmured in puzzlement.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't answer him even if he wanted to. He himself was also completely at a loss.</p>

  <p>All he did was pour the chaotic energy into the spear, which quickly devoured all of it at once.</p>

  <p>'Was it still not enough?' he thought to himself in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no idea what just happened, but he now had a faint understanding of the Saint Killing Spear. It seemed that the weapon was an absolute glutton who couldn't be readily satisfied with the already concentrated chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Good thing Luo Zheng's chaotic sea wasn't small and he could pour even more chaotic energy into the hungry spear.</p>

  <p>He didn't think too much of it. He simply poured the chaotic energy into the spear again until he thought that it was enough. Once the weapon felt more or less stable, he then thrust it out with his left hand towards Malachi.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy it consumed formed a huge spear shadow beside the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>The Shadowy Spin was a spear skill of the Saint Killing Spear. It was the type of weapon that did not need an owner to cultivate a special skill. All Luo Luo Zheng needed to do was feed it in order to activate its skillset.</p>

  <p>It hurt to admit it but this enormous spear shadow cast by Luo Luo Zheng was far beyond any of the spear shadows Malachi had ever used.</p>

  <p>Malachi couldn't help but look surprised as he stared at his opponent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Shadowy Spin was, in fact, a hundred times stronger than his.</p>

  <p>Malachi could just feel it! And this was the first time Luo Luo Zheng had activated it too.</p>

  <p>Was he seeing things? He definitely wasn't.</p>

  <p>How in the world did this happen?</p>

  <p>Malachi naturally understood the Saint Killing Spear since it had been his weapon, but he was at a loss for its current behavior. He didn't know why it made those exploding sounds earlier, nor could he understand how it was able to manifest such a powerful Shadowy Spin.</p>

  <p>From his experience, the spear shadow born out of the spear was entirely dependent on the amount of life vitality poured into it. Even if Malachi emptied out his entire life vitality sea to activate the spear strike, it still wouldn't achieve the degree of power Luo Luo Zheng currently managed to manifest.</p>

  <p>"No! This is impossible!" he roared in frustration.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is impossible," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile before thrusting the Saint Killing Spear towards Malachi.</p>

  <p>The majestic illusory spear shadow spun like crazy and headed straight for its former master.</p>

  <p>Malachi once used the power of the Shadowy Spin to create a small hole in the city wall, but the one Luo Luo Zheng manifested would no doubt be able to destroy it entirely.</p>

  <p>There was no way he could block it.</p>

  <p>'Flee!'</p>

  <p>This was the only thought in Malachi's mind.</p>

  <p>But there was no way out! Luo Luo Zheng wasn't going to let him go that easily.</p>

  <p>In the end, Malachi had no choice but to get swallowed up by the spear shadow and perish.</p>

  <p>A red light then quickly flew towards the city, containing Malachi's soul.</p>

  <p>The rules might have changed but revivals were still centralized in the city.</p>

  <p>'I still don't get any Illusion Points. Malachi has three Exemption Medallions. I have to kill him four times if I want to get his points!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself as he followed the red dot and charged straight into the city. He would kill Malachi as soon as he revived.</p>

  <p>Inside the city, the battle was getting even way more intense.</p>

  <p>Everyone seemed to be fighting. The strong warriors that had just recently returned from the Hall of Causality, some ace talents, and ordinary warriors in general were all fighting against one another.</p>

  <p>The city had once been protected by the rules of the heavens, but less than five minutes after the lifting of the fight prohibition, the entire city had been reduced to nothing but broken rubble.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Law Powers shot out in all directions, and anyone who was not careful enough would no doubt get hit and die without even knowing what or who killed them.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the city were numerous round balls of light, symbolizing the warriors who were about to be resurrected.</p>

  <p>Beside these balls of light were a group of warriors who waited for the revival of their vanquished opponents, ready to repeat the cycle and kill them all over again.</p>

  <p>This was the fate that weaker warriors were doomed to have: an endless cycle of being killed and resurrection. All of their Illusion Points would be squeezed out of their bodies until there was nothing left.</p>
