<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was reminded by the Snake Goddess's words.</p>

  <p>Then, he asked the brush-wielder, "There is still one thing that I don't understand. According to what you said, the Four Spirits Sect will only recruit those who have entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard. But more than a thousand chaotic eras have passed, and it looks like I'm the only one who entered. Isn't that too high a threshold?"</p>

  <p>In the current round of chaos, the only other person who had fused with the strongest bloodline was the Eye Spirit. Yet, even he had failed to reach the last room in the past.</p>

  <p>If the Other Shore was surely a mechanism built to select talents for the Four Spirits Sect, it was a bit absurd for it to be so strict.</p>

  <p>"The current Four Spirits Sect is no longer what it used to be. You should have known something about that in the Eternal Divine Courtyard," the brush-wielder said.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Divine Courtyard was known as the main center of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>If they had abandoned even such an important center, then it wasn't hard to imagine what major crisis the Four Spirits Sect had undergone. He started to wonder if this force still existed.</p>

  <p>"I've already answered your question. Now you should tell me how many light columns appeared when you integrated with the ancestry-level bloodline," the brush-wielder said.</p>

  <p>After all, that was what the brush-wielder was most concerned about.</p>

  <p>"All of them," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The brush-wielder was confused at Zheng's words for a moment.</p>

  <p>"All three hundred and seventy-three kinds. The bloodline map on the square was completely activated. I've fused with the complete ancestry-level bloodline," Zheng explained nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>The truth was that even he didn't get why he obtained the complete ancestry-level bloodline. He was no less curious and confused than the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>He had discussed the problem with the Primeval Lord of Heaven on his way back to the Eternal Scroll Painting from the Eternal Divine Courtyard. He tried to figure it out, but he didn't find any clues that could lead to the truth.</p>

  <p>As for the brush-wielder, he fell silent again after hearing Zheng's answer. The fox girl beside him blinked with confusion. She could sense the unusual emotions from the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>"The complete bloodline map... As far as I know, no one in the Four Spirits Sect has ever managed to activate it. They couldn't even activate a complete single quadrant," the brush-wielder murmured.</p>

  <p>There were a total of four quadrants on the bloodline map, which included the destruction quadrant, the life quadrant, the creation quadrant and the space-time quadrant. If any of them was fully activated, the result would undoubtedly be an immensely strong bloodline.</p>

  <p>However, to initiate even a single quadrant required more than ninety light columns to be activated. Someone in the Four Spirits Sect had used a unique method to achieve this, but not when they were merging with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the brush-wielder concluded that it was a nearly impossible task.</p>

  <p>Since he also didn't see it for himself, Zheng's words sounded absurd to him.</p>

  <p>"How will you prove that?" he asked further.</p>

  <p>In reality, the truth of the matter made no difference to him? but it was something he had never heard of, so he couldn't help but feel curious.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng blinked and thought for a while.</p>

  <p>First of all, he couldn't use the complete ancestry-level bloodline at his will.</p>

  <p>Second, his control over it wasn't that good ever since he had merged with it. Most of the time, the ancestry-level bloodline only worked automatically to help him.</p>

  <p>For example, it could help him identify the composition of all energies, or adjust the kinds of energies he used to restrain those of his opponents.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, he stretched out his hand. With a surge of the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body, a specific type of energy suddenly appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>That was the first kind of energy in the life quadrant.</p>

  <p>Afterward, that energy continually changed. It changed from the first kind to the second, the third, then the fourth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the brush-wielder observed the ever-changing energy in Zheng's palm for a long while. Finally, he let out a short, wry laugh and said, "No wonder... no wonder you can freely combine the abilities of the bloodline.</p>

  <p>How did you obtain all the abilities on the map?"</p>

  <p>He had once controlled all the passageways to the Eternal Divine Courtyard, so he had seen a lot of talents from different secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how amazing and extraordinary they were, none of them achieved the same thing as Zheng.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, even the geniuses of the Four Spirits Sect couldn't do that as well.</p>

  <p>It was a miracle that such a thing happened to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Zheng answered earnestly.</p>

  <p>Both the brush-wielder and the fox girl were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>They exchanged silent looks and wondered how they should react.</p>

  <p>In any case, Zheng had greatly exceeded the expectations of the brush-wielder no matter what.</p>

  <p>Of course, that boosted his confidence in the future. "Sir, may I leave now?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He had stayed in the Eternal Scroll Painting for too long, and he didn't want to waste any more time in the place.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can," the brush-wielder nodded, "but I have one more thing to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Please go ahead," Zheng said without much surprise.</p>

  <p>During his journey from the Soul City to the Land of Bone Tribulation, then to the Eternal Scroll Painting, he had sensed that things had gone too smoothly for him. It felt like everything had played out in a well-planned way.</p>

  <p>Thus, he didn't believe that all of these happened only by sheer luck.</p>

  <p>Still, no matter where all of these led him, they helped him grow stronger in the process. Therefore, he decided not to go against it for the time being.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder was one part of the plot.</p>

  <p>Since he had passed through the Eternal Scroll Painting, Zheng decided to know everything he could from him. "You've got a key in the Soul City, haven't you?" the brush-wielder asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Many people knew that Zheng had entered the room at the top of the Soul City, so he couldn't be bothered to hide it.</p>

  <p>"After you enter the Three Purities Stage, take the key to the center of the Jade Pure Realm," the brush-wielder said.</p>

  <p>"The center of the Jade Pure Realm?" Zheng arched an eyebrow in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's the core area of the Three Purities Stage," the brush-wielder added.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others also seemed astonished at the information.</p>

  <p>If the entire Other Shore were to be divided into two parts, the first thirty-two stages would be the first half, and the Three Purities Stage alone would be the other half.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Three Purities Stage wasn't large, but every Other Shore Token that came from it was far more powerful than those in the first thirty-two stages. Naturally, it was more dangerous there as well.</p>

  <p>Now, even the Grand Pure Realm was much dangerous, let alone the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>As for the Jade Pure Realm, very few people, including those from the ruling forces, entered that area throughout all chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Even the Element Spirit Civilization, who was said to have occupied the Three Purities Stage, didn't know much about the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>As for the center of the Jade Pure Realm, it meant the innermost part of the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't know what was inside there, or what kind of danger awaited them in that place.</p>

  <p>"What will I find there? Is it a door that needs a key?" Zheng asked with a smile. To his surprise, the brush-wielder nodded.</p>

  <p>"You're right. It's a door buried in the ground. You have to open it!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What's inside it?" Zheng asked curiously. "Someone will answer you after you open it," the brush-wielder replied.</p>

  <p>"But I don't have to open it. Maybe it's not necessarily a good thing for me.</p>

  <p>So, you have to tell me what's in there," Zheng shot back with a smile.</p>

  <p>Despite his threat, the brush-wielder did not seem to care at all. Then, he floated up in the air and said in an ethereal voice, "You will go there anyway. This world is the last pure land. You won't just stand by and watch this pure land collapse. Since he has blessed you, you cannot escape this fate..."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the brush-wielder disappeared from his view and left the fox girl behind, who still stared at him in disbelief.</p>
