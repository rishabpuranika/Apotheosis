  <p>
</p>

  <p>With no loud sounds heralding its destruction, the sun simply and quietly disappeared from Zheng's field of vision.</p>

  <p>"Did I just shoot down a sun?" Zheng asked in shock, dazedly holding the Sun Shooting Bow.</p>

  <p>Houyi chided him, "What's the big deal? Should I set off some fireworks for celebration?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at Houyi and rolled his eyes.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter how it happened; what was clear was that the Sun Shooting Bow could definitely help destroy a sun.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help thinking of the masters in the North Mysterious City and how long they could still hold on. His most important task right now was to shoot down and destroy the remaining suns.</p>

  <p>He put away the golden bow and directly flew towards the next nearest sun.</p>

  <p>A hundred provinces from where Zheng had been located Smack dab in the center of that province, there was a huge abyss. At the bottom of this abyss, there stood several people.</p>

  <p>There was a huge crack in front of them.</p>

  <p>The crack looked very strange, as if it was embedded in the stone wall and parallel to the space.</p>

  <p>A burly man stood on the abyss floor beside the crack. It was Mount who had fought with Zheng in the past.</p>

  <p>"I'll go in now," Mount uttered, cupping his hands towards the other people.</p>

  <p>The man who stood closer to Mount smiled faintly. "Do you have any hesitation with integrating yourself with it like this?"</p>

  <p>Mount mastered his expression to stay calm. "We are from the same origin.</p>

  <p>After I merge with it, what you will see may be either me or it. I have nothing to lose, so why should I hesitate?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded and said, "Go ahead."</p>

  <p>Mount stepped towards the crack.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, his entire body had been covered by countless mirror-like shards of space that turned him into many smaller pieces.</p>

  <p>The fragments did not really tear Mount apart, so they did not trigger the Chaotic Source Spirits within his body. Countless shards reflected back a complete image of Mount stepping into the crack.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>The moment that Mount's fragments disappeared into the crack, a gigantic eye peered out of it.</p>

  <p>The crack was more than 40 million feet deep and 3 million feet wide; but when the eye appeared, only a small portion of it was visible.</p>

  <p>Those people who had been standing in front of the crack were all top masters in the Source World, but they still got nervous under the creepy gaze of the eye. They only breathed a sigh of relief when the eye disappeared.</p>

  <p>These people were top masters from the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the group was a man wearing a black coat made of feathers and with sharp eyes. He was the Yellow Thearch, leader of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"Can you make sure that there would be no accident this time?" the Yellow Thearch asked.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer, who stood just beside him, gave a slight nod as affirmation.</p>

  <p>"There would be no hitches regarding our plans, but..."</p>

  <p>He trailed off as he glanced at Emperor Charm a small distance away.</p>

  <p>There was a condition that needed to be fulfilled before these plans could take shape, and that was the great descending.</p>

  <p>Even though the group had already obtained half the number of Descending Rings, the great descending hadn't succeeded yet.</p>

  <p>After deduction, they fixed their sights on the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in Zheng's hands. Perhaps if they took those spirits, they might succeed.</p>

  <p>They had already planned to obliterate the Oneness Sky Palace first and because of Zheng, they started the war ahead of schedule.</p>

  <p>It should have been easy work for the Sun Crow race to destroy the Oneness Sky Palace after they had had Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi trapped on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, the news that was brought back by Emperor Charm did not bring good tidings.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm enveloped himself inside a fluffy white fur robe, his delicate face framed by the immaculately white fur. His eyes flashed fiercely as he said, "All the surviving fighting forces of the Oneness Sky Palace are still in the North Unicorn Province. With the Nine-Sun World Destruction, I will decimate the North Unicorn Province and also obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits myself."</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's handsome visage was unperturbed on the surface, but his anger was raging inside his heart.</p>

  <p>Although he was only a direct clone of the real Emperor Charm, his bloodline, strength, and mood were almost the same as that of the real Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>The possibility that the Sun Crow race could be defeated had never entered his mind.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they were captured by the Oneness Sky Palace in an extremely humiliating way!</p>

  <p>Exploding in a fit of fury, Emperor Charm had no choice but to finally use the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Every time the Sun Crow race invaded a province, he would mark that province with nine seals made of his bloodline. Then he could use them to deploy the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy regardless of distance.</p>

  <p>This would be his last resort. He had never thought that the time would come that he needed to use this theurgy.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Emperor Charm finished speaking, he suddenly opened his eyes with a piercing look and knitted eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Emperor Charm? Did someone destroy your Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy?" Divine Farmer smirked.</p>

  <p>His question was made in jest.</p>

  <p>None could dodge their doom once Emperor Charm activated this theurgy, not to mention that the Oneness Sky Palace was short of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin. Even if they faced that theurgy, they could only run away with their subordinates.</p>

  <p>"One sun has been extinguished," Emperor Charm muttered in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Thearch, who was standing close to him, snapped his head towards him when he heard this. Surprise was written all over his features.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>"It has been really extinguished. I'll take a closer look," Emperor Charm said as he waved his fingers in front of him. His eyes glowed with a blazing white light while he saw the world that had been burnt by the scorching suns in his mind.</p>

  <p>His vision of the world slowly came into focus and he looked around.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, he saw Zheng flying through the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng was flying directly towards the second sun, clutching a golden bow in his hand.</p>

  <p>An idea came to Emperor Charm's mind. It was so absurd it seemed impossible...</p>

  <p>'Did this runty brat extinguish one of the suns?'</p>

  <p>Just as Emperor Charm was ruminating about this possibility, Zheng aimed the bow and pulled the string taut. Golden marks appeared on both his body and the bow, then he let the arrow loose.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>That arrow's power seemed ridiculously feeble in Emperor Charm's eyes.</p>

  <p>It flew towards the center of the sun, seemingly in slow motion, before it turned into a tiny black ball that expanded before dissipating.</p>

  <p>The huge sun also disappeared.</p>

  <p>'What is it?'</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's eyes twitched as if he had witnessed the most unbelievable scenario he had ever seen in his life.</p>

  <p>"How did it go out, dude?"</p>

  <p>The interest of the two strongest warriors, Divine Farmer and the Yellow Thearch, were extremely piqued.</p>

  <p>With an irritated snort and a wave of two of his fingers in the air, Emperor Charm conjured a space in front of them that reflected Zheng's figure as he pulled the long bow taut.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he the guy with the Soaring Snake Sword?" the Yellow Thearch asked.</p>

  <p>"It's him," Divine Farmer confirmed.</p>

  <p>After the battle of the Chaotic Source World, Zheng had attracted the attention of these beings.</p>

  <p>However, they had not seen Zheng go to any significant place except wander around the Other Shore. A number of super forces had already hatched some plans to kill him, but no one could follow his tracks at all.</p>

  <p>They had planned to kill Zheng and Feng Ge on the Other Shore, but instead, it was their stage ruler who had been killed by them. Not a hair on their head had been harmed.</p>

  <p>"He isn't afraid of the scorching suns?" Divine Farmer asked innocently. He thought this was what Emperor Charm wanted them to see.</p>

  <p>"No, he has destroyed my two suns," said Emperor Charm, a finger pointed accusingly at Zheng's figure.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, Zheng pulled his long bow again, already aiming at the third sun.</p>
