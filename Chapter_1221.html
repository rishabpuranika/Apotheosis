<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The seven of them could do nothing about the sealed Evil Dragon. They could only send for more capable and powerful Celestial Position warriors from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the Tower of Crystal was even more important.</p>

  <p>Although Max and his men didn't believe that Luo Luo Zheng had gained the title of the golden Celestial Position, they really wanted to see how Luo Luo Zheng had obtained recognition from the Talent Tablet. Was his talent listed on the second row or the first row of the Talent Tablet? Or had he obtained a bronze title?</p>

  <p>All these doubts needed to be clarified.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng said rather nonchalantly, "I will take you to the Tower of Crystal, but before that, I still have something important to do."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had planned that after he obtained the life crystals, he would return to the Central Region as soon as possible. But his plan had been delayed since he had promised the cyan dragon that he would enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land to take out the Ancestral Dragon Egg.</p>

  <p>He had obtained the Ancestral Dragon, but it was hard to say where it would belong in the end.</p>

  <p>Even if this Ancestral Dragon had an imprinting of him on it, the Celestial Position would never give it up. Moreover, Derek was also here, watching him covetously, and Luo Luo Zheng was sure that he would not give up easily.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was not worried. Neither Derek nor the warriors of the Celestial Position had shown absolute hostility towards him. Furthermore, he had obtained the title of the golden Celestial Position in the Tower of Crystal, so he only needed to cooperate with them. But before that, he had to return to the Central Region to save Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Important thing? Is that an excuse for you to back away?" Woody said coldly. Even if Luo Luo Zheng possessed the mark of the Celestial Position, he had only gained recognition. Woody felt that Luo Luo Zheng had boasted about his achievements, but didn't dare try to prove it for fear of being caught.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked witheringly at Woody as he replied, "I am not from the Divine Kingdom Continent. I came here only to seek life stones to save someone. If you don't believe me, you can search for the Tower of Crystal in this great world yourself. This great world isn't too big for you, is it?"</p>

  <p>Although this great world was not that big, it was still difficult to accurately pinpoint the location of the Sea God Continent. The four divine kingdoms were relatively close to the Central Region, but the Sea God Continent was too far away. It was not that the several warriors of the Celestial Position could not find it. But if Luo Luo Zheng did not provide the coordinates and direction, it would be impossible for them to find the Tower of Crystal in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>"Humph! It's so simple! We can directly search your soul. Dorothea is most proficient in this technique," Woody said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened at this, but Dorothea interjected, "He was recognized by our Celestial Position. If he were to join the Celestial Position in the future, he would become our compatriot. So watch your tongue, Woody!"</p>

  <p>Woody chuckled and continued, "He's just a martial artist from the Lower World who is fortunate enough to have his name listed on the Talent Tablet. At most, he would only be able to leave his name on the second row! And compatriot? Is this fellow qualified to be our compatriot?"</p>

  <p>Dorothea shook her head. Sometimes, Woody didn't think before speaking. But Dorothea still had a glimmer of hope because Luo Luo Zheng really didn't seem like he was lying. So Dorothea said, "What if what he said is true? What if he really does have the golden Celestial Position title?"</p>

  <p>If they could confirm that Luo Zheng's talent had really been honored with the title of the golden Celestial Position, it would be a news to celebrate for the entire Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Woody laughed loudly. "Dorothea, you have always been shrewd and astute. But right now, I can't believe that you are actually convinced by this brat's words!"</p>

  <p>Delroy, Tiernan, and the others also started laughing. They might have believed it if Luo Luo Zheng had claimed to have obtained the silver or bronze title.</p>

  <p>But it all sounded too strange when he claimed to have received the golden title. They would probably not believe it even if they saw it with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>"What will you do if it is true?" Dorothea stared at Woody and asked seriously. She didn't know why but this time, she chose to believe Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was her sixth sense that was telling her that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't lying.</p>

  <p>With a swish, Woody produced his black saber, maneuvered it effortlessly in a series of arcs and placed it before him. He said flatly, "If it's true, I will swallow the Black Nether Saber in one gulp!"</p>

  <p>"Really?" Dorothea blinked and then laughed.</p>

  <p>Woody nodded. He was serious this time. "Yes, I mean it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gasped as he watched them make the bet. The Black Nether Saber, at least a supreme divine weapon, was unusually sharp, and this guy was saying he would swallow it if he lost! Luo Luo Zheng couldn't wait to see if he could do it or not.</p>

  <p>"You two stop messing around!" Max's voice sounded. He finally turned to Luo Luo Zheng and said, "Since you said you wanted to go back to save someone, we shall leave immediately. We can take you there, and it won't take much time!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's spirits lifted at this.</p>

  <p>Right this moment, a terrifying storm was brewing in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. It would be difficult to cross the ocean, even for Soul Sea Realm masters. Even if Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Life and Death Realm, he would probably have died if he forced his way through.</p>

  <p>The abilities of this group of Spirit Supreme Realm masters were unimaginably powerful. And if they could help bring him back to the Central Region, he would be grateful to them.</p>

  <p>"Okay, we shall set off immediately!" Max said, waving his hand. A piece of blood-red rune appeared in his hand which he casually tossed away. The rune formed a huge red cross, which then firmly engraved itself on the ground.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" a few martial artists from the four divine kingdoms whispered.</p>

  <p>"It's just a locating rune used by the Celestial Position. Using special methods, they can return here at any time," Derek said sullenly. From the conversation between Luo Luo Zheng and the warriors of the Celestial Position, it seemed that Luo Luo Zheng had taken a test in a tower belonged to the Celestial Position. And this piece of information had left him sour.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position didn't have a good reputation in the universe, but they were very famous. Derek knew about the three towers of the Celestial Position that were used for warriors to practice, and it was said that they had lost one. But he had never heard of Tianxing ever having been tested in the tower.</p>

  <p>Previously as Luo Luo Zheng was in the process of undergoing his tribulation, Derek knew that this kid had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower. Derek had been overjoyed at the time. To him, the Ancestral Dragon Egg was very important and Luo Luo Zheng, even more so.</p>

  <p>He had been thrilled to see Luo Luo Zheng appear on the Divine Emperor Island with an Ancestral Dragon in his arms. But he had not expected the Celestial Position race to interfere. But gauging from their conversation, it looked like Luo Luo Zheng had already gone through the test in a tower and had a Celestial Position mark on him.</p>

  <p>Derek's heart was filled with despair, his face darkening.</p>

  <p>After setting up the locating rune, Max once again raised his cane and gently waved it in the air before bringing it down in a sharp slash. An irregular space crack appeared out of thin air.</p>

  <p>"Delroy, open it," Max ordered.</p>

  <p>Delroy nodded and walked towards the space crack that was over a hundred feet high. He stretched his hand and sent an enchanted barrier shooting out of it. Shortly after, the enchanted barrier started to rapidly expand. Cracking sounds rent the air before the enchanted barrier succeeded in opening the space crack. A small space hole had appeared.</p>

  <p>Hank took out the Eight-diagram Wheel that was several dozen feet wide. It grew as the wind came at it and it was pretty obvious that this was their treasure to fly.</p>

  <p>Woody and the rest of the group followed Max and jumped onto the Eight-diagram Wheel. Dorothea then looked at Luo Luo Zheng and said, "Alright, let's go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. His eyes turned towards the group containing Fiona and Randy, and looked at them wistfully yet fondly. Although he hadn't been in the Divine Kingdom Continent for very long, he had made many friends.</p>

  <p>A variety of thoughts flitted through the minds of the group Luo Luo Zheng was looking at. Luo Luo Zheng had saved them several times, but if it weren't for Luo Luo Zheng, they wouldn't have been able to return from the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. Even their fathers and all the other Soul Sea Realm masters of the four divine kingdoms wouldn't have survived without Luo Zheng's help.</p>

  <p>They were grateful to Luo Luo Zheng, but now, Randy and the others were reluctant to part with him.</p>

  <p>They couldn't talk to Luo Luo Zheng, given the current situation. Even the four rulers chose to remain silent in the presence of this group of Spirit Supreme Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>As their gazes met, Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said, "I will come back!"</p>

  <p>He had barely finished talking when Fiona suddenly turned into a fiery red shadow and ran towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
