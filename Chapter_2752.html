<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Desperation Plain had become quite the chaotic place now.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings might have been currently fighting a fierce battle, but they had a great advantage in the overall situation.</p>

  <p>In spite of the latter, they were clear on the fact that it wouldn't be as easy when it came to taking the Abyss Demon Region down.</p>

  <p>Seeing as the fiends were willing to fight here, it was obligatory that they had their preparations made in order to meet contingencies.</p>

  <p>Nicholas pinned down Gallio as he quietly observed the whole situation.</p>

  <p>After Rachelle had given him a warning, Nicholas had equally discovered Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he noticed Zheng, his mind was immediately filled with confusion and questions. 'This guy is simply too amazing! He could enter any damn place he desires!' he thought to himself, his heart sinking heavily.</p>

  <p>He himself had led a group of Holy Beings into the sixth stage, and had experienced a lot of trouble in doing so. It had been quite the challenging task.</p>

  <p>He just couldn't figure out how Zheng, a mere consummate True God, had come here.</p>

  <p>That wasn't to say that Nicholas thought Zheng's arrival was a bad thing, though.</p>

  <p>One of the main reasons Nicholas was in such a hurry to control the Abyss Demon Region was because he wanted to confront the people at the Other Shore Realm outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>If he could catch Zheng, then it would be an incredible benefit for him. At the very least, he could get to know the masters of the Other Shore Realm through Zheng.</p>

  <p>It had only taken a few quick seconds for these crazy thoughts to start relaying each other in his mind.</p>

  <p>By moving his lips ever so slightly, he sent a message through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan, the Tang Clan and the Mu Clan each had a Demi-holy Being capable of receiving his message.</p>

  <p>Upon reception, each of them looked at the north side of the Desperation Plain. They immediately jumped out of battle and flew in that direction.</p>

  <p>"These guys are so powerful! Even fiends are no match! Can you believe it?</p>

  <p>If only they could kill those fiends!</p>

  <p>What a bitter situation this all is! Even Gallio is pressed and beaten by them. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>The strange fish leaned on the side of the space door and from its position, watched the chaotic battle with interest.</p>

  <p>Leland said nothing and kept a calm, casual look on his face.</p>

  <p>A few of the Demi-holy Beings in the Desperation Plain were Leland's acquaintances. Although somewhat worried, he still had hope.</p>

  <p>As long as the powerful alliance won, he knew he would eventually get through this hard period of time.</p>

  <p>He was definitely concerned about Zheng, however.</p>

  <p>Looking intently in the direction Zheng had fled, Leland saw at least seven or eight consummate True Gods chasing after him at a very fast pace. They appeared to be catching up to him, too.</p>

  <p>All thus suggested that what Zheng had said was true. He was indeed connected to the powerful alliance because otherwise, at such a critical moment, the alliance would never have sent warriors to follow him.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Zheng's strength was far beyond that of a normal consummate True God. In fact, the two didn't compare at all.</p>

  <p>Even as a mighty Demi-holy Being, Leland would still be placed under great pressure when fighting Zheng.</p>

  <p>The strike where Zheng had killed the fiend commander had stunned Leland in particular. So much so, in fact, that he was sure he wouldn't be capable of withstanding it. He was definitely terrified.</p>

  <p>Even if these consummate True Gods were from powerful clans, they weren't necessarily up to par with Zheng, nor could they be considered a match for battle.</p>

  <p>"I really hope you can get out of here successfully, Zheng."</p>

  <p>He owed Zheng a debt of gratitude. If it weren't for Zheng, he would have died back in the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>Just as Leland was losing himself deeper and deeper in thought, three other figures unexpectedly appeared in that direction.</p>

  <p>"Oh...Three Demi-holy Beings..."</p>

  <p>Leland's eyes visibly narrowed at once.</p>

  <p>"Jayden Dongfang, Mathew Mu and Raymond Tang!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Much like the consummate True Gods, the Demi-holy Beings had different levels of strength.</p>

  <p>A top-level consummate True God, such as Troy, was not inferior to an ordinary Demi-holy Being when it came to strength.</p>

  <p>A Demi-holy Being who wasn't a powerful clan member, like Leland, would never have the strength nor the skill to defeat Troy.</p>

  <p>Jayden Dongfang, Mathew Mu and Raymond Tang were the most powerful Demi-holy Beings among all the powerful clans. It was safe to say that it was surprising to see this trio chasing after Zheng.</p>

  <p>Like Leland, they were also the Demi-holy Beings, but their strength, power and skill had much exceeded his. They were on two very separate levels.</p>

  <p>"These impressive Demi-holy beings have equally come out... I'm afraid that Zheng might be in danger!"</p>

  <p>As Leland spoke these words, he couldn't help himself from sighing loudly.</p>

  <p>Even though he wanted to help, he wasn't powerful enough, and desire alone just wouldn't be enough. He had no other choice but to sit still and silently hope that Zheng could escape safely.</p>

  <p>Seeing as Rachelle had reminded the Holy Beings of Zheng's coming, Zheng had made the ultimate decision to flee.</p>

  <p>When it came down to it, Zheng was certain that falling into the fiends' hands was probably better than getting caught by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Once he passed through the mountain range on the left side of the Desperation Plain, a huge sea of bubbling hot lava suddenly confronted him.</p>

  <p>Left with no choice, Zheng flew over the lava sea's surface without a moment's hesitation and launched his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"They are chasing me!" he said to himself.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng spread his spiritual sense out, he sensed three new auras appear behind him.</p>

  <p>He glanced back for less than a split second, just long enough to take notice that the auras were from three consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Just three consummate True Gods?" he asked. Zheng squinted his eyes a little.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to the divine land, Zheng had immediately displayed his strength.</p>

  <p>In other words, Nicholas should know that the consummate True Gods simply weren't powerful enough to catch him. Even thirty of them couldn't make it, let alone just three.</p>

  <p>As soon as he made note of who they had sent, Zheng wasn't in the mood to pay them any attention. He continued zooming over the lava sea with concentration.</p>

  <p>On the right side of the Desperation Plain was located the fiend race's pasture. There, the fierce monsters present were basically their food.</p>

  <p>Yet, what Zheng didn't know was that on the left side was the famous Desperation Sea.</p>

  <p>Not even a fiend would want to step foot into a damned place such as this one.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>As Zheng was speeding forward, layers of ripples suddenly began to appear in the lava sea just inches below his feet.</p>

  <p>As he noticed the additional movement in the lava sea, Zheng frowned. Now, he sensed eight or nine powerful auras coming from the sea.</p>

  <p>"Thunder Materialization!" he shouted with might.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A huge pair of thunder wings materialized on Zheng's back at once, and his speed increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was hurrying forward, several huge creatures suddenly appeared in the lava sea, completely blocking his way. Zheng didn't know what to do or where to go!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The boiling, orange-red lava splashed everywhere.</p>

  <p>From the lava emerged several enormous, slender snake heads, each of which was as bright as freshly polished metal. Facing Zheng head on, they all gave off a ferocious aura.</p>

  <p>"No fucking way! Nine-head Snake living in the lava sea? This is impossible!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had no interest, nor did he have the time, to start guessing the Nine-head Snake's origin.</p>

  <p>Just seconds before the snake heads had a chance to come at him with their gaping mouths and sharp fangs, Zheng swung his sword in front of him several times.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>As his sword light continued to flash in the air, Zheng had already spread his thunder wings and quickly raised himself off the lava, continuing to flee forward.</p>

  <p>He had no time to fool around with such monsters.</p>

  <p>"Grr! Ow!"</p>

  <p>Without any forewarning, the Nine-head Snake in the lava raised skyward and began to howl vehemently. As it did so, it began to extend its huge heads infinitely and rushed directly toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>The snake heads inevitably moved even faster than Zheng could. Three of them even got ahead of Zheng, slithering in front of him in order to block his way.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" Zheng said under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!</p>

  <p>Truth of Cultivation Nature!" he called.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, Zheng's body became extremely nimble. From the air, he shot himself outward in a strange way and swept past the snake heads.</p>

  <p>The nine heads opened their mouths to attack but only bit Zheng's shadow trailing behind him.</p>

  <p>The Nine-head Snake's block a few moments ago had had its desired effect, though.</p>

  <p>The pursuers behind Zheng seemed to really be catching up now. At least, they were defintely even closer to him than before.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around in order to avoid the Nine-head Snake's attacks when his gaze froze. Only then did he realize that two of the people who were apparently chasing him, or so he thought, were actually Liusu and Aleyna!</p>
