<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared calmly but coldly at Eddie. He knew from the beginning that this fight wouldn't be easy and that Eddie would not give in without a fight.</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later the Central Region will be wiped out by the York Divine Kingdom. Hahahahaha!" Eddie laughed hysterically and his voice was sinister. His charred face looked like the face of a monster.</p>

  <p>He reached out his trembling hands to fetch the Eight-diagram Mirror from his space ring and with fierce strength he threw it at Luo Luo Zheng who casually blocked and pushed the Eight-diagram Mirror to the side. The Eight-diagram Mirror fell and rolled a few times on the ground. When it came to a stop, a human figure slowly formed on its broken surface.</p>

  <p>Everyone was looking at Luo Luo Zheng. The battle between Luo Luo Zheng and Eddie was what they were most concerned about. They wanted to see what tricks Eddie would use at the end of his resources.</p>

  <p>A human figure slowly came out of the mirror. It was the figure of a boy that Luo Luo Zheng had met before.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the little boy coming out of the mirror. With a look of contempt in his face he asked Eddie, "Is this your last resort? Is this all you've got? He is a nobody, someone I defeated without difficulty."</p>

  <p>The boy suddenly spoke up, "Your name is Luo Luo Zheng, right?"</p>

  <p>"So what?" Luo Luo Zheng coldly replied.</p>

  <p>"You are right! Last time I lost our fight. We fought in the Melody City and that day I only lost a small part of my soul. Now that the Star Storm has stopped, you will get what you deserve. This is your end! Hahahaha! Soon the whole Central Region will become my land! And the secret hiding in the depths of your mind will also belong to me!" The boy laughed hysterically. That boy that had been defeated by Luo Luo Zheng was Master Wallace.</p>

  <p>Eddie also laughed. "Luo Luo Zheng, I advise you to give up. Stop resisting! You are doomed! There are countless masters at the Soul Sea Realm in York Divine Kingdom. They can kill you in a flash. If you choose to surrender now, I can consider giving you a dignified death. Think about it, at least your dear ones will have a corpse to mourn."</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the Oracle City trembled with fear hearing Eddie's and Master Wallace's threats. The Central Region was in the midst of a crisis and its defeat was imminent. How could they defeat Eddie now? Victory seemed so close and now all hope had vanished. How could they win with a York Divine Kingdom on Eddie's side?</p>

  <p>And with the masters at the Soul Sea Realm?</p>

  <p>The current strength of warriors in the Central Region was no match for that of Soul Sea Realm masters. A master at the Soul Sea Realm could be enough to sweep the entire Central Region away.</p>

  <p>There were massive Star Storms in the skies above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, so it was very difficult for people to travel from the divine kingdoms to the Central Region. Only a few martial artists had been to the divine kingdoms and there wasn't much communication between the martial artists of these two regions.</p>

  <p>To the Central Region, the four divine kingdoms were far too powerful. The Star Storm acted as a great barrier that protected the Central Region.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, to the four divine kingdoms, the Central Region was only considered a barren land. The four divine kingdoms didn't have much interest in the Central Region, so the two continents existed peacefully. It had been like this for many years and neither of them would interfere with each other.</p>

  <p>Judging from the tone of Master Wallace, what he cared about was not the Central Region but the secret in Luo Zheng's mind. It had to be important. Even a master of the divine kingdom was after it.</p>

  <p>"The secret in my mind?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered with a sullen face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng held in his mind a mysterious furnace and the nine Genuine Dragons.</p>

  <p>This secret was unknown to others. The last time Luo Luo Zheng fought against the soul of Master Wallace in his mind, he made the cyan dragon devour Master Wallace's soul. He didn't expect that Master Wallace hadn't completely died and had come to know about his secret.</p>

  <p>Seeing the change in Luo Zheng's face, Eddie assumed he was afraid. He said with a sneer, "Have you thought about it? Have you made a decision? If you give me all your secrets without any resistance I will not kill you. I will spare your life!"</p>

  <p>A light flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes as he coldly said, "You are a fool if you think I will let you take over my secrets!"</p>

  <p>He then pulled out the sword in his hand. A beam of light shot out from the sword and immediately sliced the Eight-diagram Mirror into pieces.</p>

  <p>The image of Master Wallace became blurry and started to disappear. All that could be seen was a weird smile lingering in the air where the figure once stood.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng drew his sword Eddie jumped up from the ground. He was the kind of man that would never yield. He would not give up. He would fight until the end.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng did not give Eddie a chance and acted quickly. He slashed Eddie with his long sword. The rays coming out of his sword were like silver snakes, entangling Eddie's body and instantly cutting his body into pieces.</p>

  <p>Eddie's fiendish head rolled on the ground with a surprised gaze. His mouth smiled and moved as if he wanted to say something. No sound came out of it. The beheaded couldn't speak. Luo Luo Zheng looked at him until his life energy completely left his body and dissipated in the air.</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt a sense of relief coming over him. He had finally killed his sworn enemy with his own hands.</p>

  <p>Since a long time ago when he was at the Cloud Sect, Eddie's shadow had followed him. He was a curse and a burden making it difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to fully dedicate to the marital arts. Now Luo Luo Zheng was finally free. He had put stop to it and removed this obstacle.</p>

  <p>All of the martial artists in Oracle City let out a sigh of relief, despite that the threats of the boy still weighed heavily against them. The battle had finally come to an end and the city was safe. Even after they had won there was still one problem to deal with, Simon.</p>

  <p>Simon was floating in the air when he saw Eddie being defeated by Luo Luo Zheng. He couldn't believe what was happening. A black life vitality suddenly began to revolve around his body. He transformed into a stream of light and swiftly rushed away, disappearing into thin air.</p>

  <p>Even though Simon was a master at the Life and Death Realm, he specialized in cultivating poisoning techniques that were incomparably good. Even Eddie, who was stronger than him, wouldn't dare to offend Simon, afraid that he might use poison against him. But now, the problem was that Simon saw with his own eyes that Luo Luo Zheng broke through his poisonous net unharmed. Obviously, he hadn't taken his special poisoning skills seriously. Then how could he fight against Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>'This brat is completely immune to poison, ' Simon thought.</p>

  <p>And now Eddie was dead. They lost the battle. There was nothing he could do and that was a sure thing. If he continued to struggle, he would face death. There was no point in fighting Luo Luo Zheng. He could never win.</p>

  <p>It seemed like he was going into hiding and was about to live in exile pretending to be someone else again.</p>

  <p>All the remaining Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect fled and scattered in all directions. Some of them were being chased by the warriors of the Oracle City, but none of the leaders or Luo Luo Zheng were going after them.</p>

  <p>Although Simon was a master at the Life and Death Realm, he was still a lone wolf and did not have a good reputation in the Central Region. The backbone of the Heavenly Evil Sect was Eddie. Now that the strongest warrior in the Central Region was dead, the entire Heavenly Evil Sect would vanish. These independent martial artists could only go on living by hiding their identities, otherwise, if they went to any sect, they would be killed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slowly walked towards Ning Yudie. Mu Ning was there too, holding her sword in her hand.</p>

  <p>The land around them had been plowed for miles by Xi Youqin's huge swords. The soil was covered with blood and mud. As Luo Luo Zheng walked on the muddy ground he left behind red footprints.</p>

  <p>The sun shone red with the blood below. As the sunglow hit the broken tiles of the Oracle City, every martial artist felt a mixed feeling of sorrow and joy in their hearts. It had been a horrific and costly battle but they had won in the end.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was overjoyed looking at Luo Luo Zheng approaching. She smiled softly. Her smile was gentle and sweet, bringing a feeling of ease to those who looked at her. She reached out her hand, trying to touch Luo Zheng's arm but he slowly avoided her and kept on walking towards Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's hand hung in the air and she felt heartbroken. She quickly gathered herself and reminded herself who she was. She rolled her bright eyes and followed Luo Luo Zheng. She knew that Luo Luo Zheng was in a bad mood and that this was not the time to be cranky.</p>

  <p>Walking up to Ning Yudie, Luo Luo Zheng held her body in his arms and flew to the sky.</p>

  <p>While floating in the air he looked down at the warriors celebrating.</p>

  <p>The army in the Oracle City did not suffer a great loss when compared to the Heavenly Evil Sect warriors. One third of the several hundred thousand martial artists of the Oracle City lost their lives, while almost all of the martial artists in the entire Heavenly Evil Sect were killed by Xi Youqin's giant swords.</p>

  <p>All of the martial artists had gathered and were happily celebrating.</p>

  <p>Someone from the crowd suddenly started to cheer, "Luo Luo Zheng! The mighty!"</p>

  <p>The sound came out loud and clear. Soon all the martial artists were shouting his name.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! The mighty!" hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of voices followed.</p>

  <p>All of the martial artists echoed and roared with their gazes turned to sky looking at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng today had become the savior of Oracle City. No, he had become the savior of all of the sects in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The martial artists then used their life vitality to amplify their voices and their cheers could be heard all across the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Their people had suffered enough and now was time to celebrate the end of evil. Their roaring cheer for victory was thunderous. They screamed so loud with their life vitality that the sound became terrifying. From now on everyone would fear and respect Luo Luo Zheng, the Mighty.</p>

  <p>The common people in the entire Oracle City cheered happily and started to dance at the sound of roar as it drifted away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lowered his head. He stroked Yudie's black hair and softly whispered in her ear, "Tia, can you hear that?"</p>
