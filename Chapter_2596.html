<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2596 The Dubhe Secret </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just like the Nine Li race, the Yellow Emperor race also had various levels of blood purity.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't classified into different levels but rather into chambers.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race had a total of nine chambers in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Yellow Emperor race were segregated into different chambers as per the different degrees of blood purity.</p>

  <p>The Dubhe Chamber was ranked first among the nine chambers.</p>

  <p>The Dubhe Chamber was inferior to the imperial-grade bloodline of the Nine Li race, but it was also quite excellent.</p>

  <p>Those who were part of the Dubhe Chamber could activate the Dubhe Secret in their blood.</p>

  <p>The Dubhe Secret was David's most powerful trump card.</p>

  <p>Wisps of golden light floated out and converged into a mysterious pamphlet.</p>

  <p>This pamphlet was known as the Dubhe Pamphlet.</p>

  <p>Very few people in the Yellow Emperor race were able to create the Dubhe Pamphlet, and each person's Dubhe Pamphlet was different.</p>

  <p>If David was born in the Source World, he would be sent to the Dubhe Chamber and study his own pamphlet. It contained very strong and complicated power, which involved the origins and secrets of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>However, David couldn't examine it in this world.</p>

  <p>He had scrutinized his pamphlet with the help of Tyler, and up to now, he had only mastered a small part of it.</p>

  <p>After all, this was not the Source World and exiles had limited abilities.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>When the golden light flowed on to the Dubhe Pamphlet for a while, it turned into a black light and covered the surface of David's body.</p>

  <p>Soon, David was entirely engulfed by the black light.</p>

  <p>His physical figure, which was over ten thousand feet tall, emitted a black light. He looked very strange.</p>

  <p>Not only were Zheng and the Nine Li people looking at him weirdly, even the people of the Yellow Emperor race were staring at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is this still Yellow Emperor Wild Body?"</p>

  <p>"Is this black light the power of our blood?"</p>

  <p>"It's so bizarre."</p>

  <p>Some elders and disciples of the Yellow Emperor race were discussing in hushed tones.</p>

  <p>One thing was certain: they felt that David's energy had increased greatly.</p>

  <p>However, this force was too alien for them. They couldn't wrap their heads around it. It was as if David was no longer a member of their race.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, that is the power of our race," Lancelot said as he regarded David in the distance. "However, this power is not something an ordinary member of our race can possess."</p>

  <p>The fact that David had the Dubhe Secret was known to only the exiles and a few members of the Yellow Emperor race. Grand Elder Lancelot was one of them.</p>

  <p>Lancelot still couldn't figure out why David, who was born in this world, had such strong blood.</p>

  <p>"I've never used the Dubhe Secret in actual combat." David looked at the black light on his body and smiled at Zheng. "You are the first opponent to see it!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He pointed the two knives at Zheng again and said, "It's not your fault if you're defeated by me, so no hard feelings!"</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With a flip of his two sharp knives, two crossed rays of black blade radiance appeared. It was as if a big cross was drawn on the white rice paper with a brush made of top-grade wolf hair. The two beams of blade radiance spiraled over.</p>

  <p>"The blade radiance is very powerful." Zheng raised his eyebrows suddenly.</p>

  <p>He didn't dare to go straight to their front; he floated slightly and managed to dodge them.</p>

  <p>As David saw that Zheng dodged the attack, a trace of disdain appeared on his face. Instead of using more force to suppress Zheng, he remained calm and raised the two sharp knives again.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The sharp knives crisscrossed, and two more rays of intertwined black blade radiance emerged.</p>

  <p>The blade radiance was tens of thousands of feet long. It could extend to hundreds of thousands of feet when it shot out.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods of the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race stayed where they were.</p>

  <p>But the Wild Gods from the Flying Sickle City had to move away to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>Although they were standing at a safe distance, they couldn't help but worry about the terrible consequence if they were accidentally caught in combat.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Streaks of black blade radiance zoomed past.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, David was strolling towards Zheng at a leisurely pace instead of chasing him.</p>

  <p>"Weren't you very strong earlier? You can't do anything now, can you?"</p>

  <p>David glanced at Zheng, hoping that he would give him the satisfaction of watching him struggle and resist. He liked to feel superior to his opponents, but if the gap between him and his opponents was too great, he would get bored.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As two beams of crossed blade radiance dashed towards him, Zheng waved his hand again.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Parting Water Divine Mirror was already set in front of him.</p>

  <p>But the mirror didn't work this time.</p>

  <p>When the two beams of crossed black blade radiance touched the mirror, it shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng was extremely fast. When he saw the mirror breaking, he quickly retreated and rolled to the other side, making a huge crater on the ground in order to avoid the black radiance.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that you can't resist the blade radiance!" David laughed coldly. "I thought you could resist everything!"</p>

  <p>David and Zheng chased each other in the deserted land, and the two races fretted about them.</p>

  <p>"What method has David used to boost his strength like this all of a sudden? Zheng can do him no harm," said an elder of the Nine Li race worriedly.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is the black blade radiance? It is really very powerful," asked Giacomo with a frown.</p>

  <p>Originally, Zheng had had the upper hand, but now he was unable to fight back. Naturally, they were anxious.</p>

  <p>Adele had been studying Zheng nervously, not saying a word.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a newcomer in the Nine Li race and did not display his full strength to her.</p>

  <p>Since he was a True God, he must have his own unique skills but Adele didn't know if he could fight against David.</p>

  <p>Poof!</p>

  <p>Zheng avoided another ray of crossed black blade radiance.</p>

  <p>However, the black blade radiance swept past Zheng's back dangerously close, leaving a bloody wound on his back.</p>

  <p>He immediately felt a burning sensation.</p>

  <p>After his body was rebuilt, its strength was further boosted. However, the attack of the black blade radiance left it weak and vulnerable.</p>

  <p>"It's about time we end our battle," said David with a smug smile when he saw an injured Zheng. "I can feel your fear, helplessness and unwillingness. These are emotions that paralyze weak people like you! If you are willing to kneel before me and beg me for mercy, I may consider sparing your life."</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me? You think I need you to spare my life?" Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>David didn't care about Zheng's attitude and spoke slowly, "How stubborn you are! Like the guy killed by Roy, you have to use your own life to finish the battle!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he raised the two sharp knives again. This time, the black light on his body began to flicker violently. It looked like the end of the battle was close.</p>

  <p>Hearing Roy's name, Romeo and the others were very sad. After all, Monty from the Nine Li race was the only one to be killed in this battle.</p>

  <p>But now, they were even more worried about Zheng.</p>

  <p>Giacomo had planned to ask Zheng to admit defeat directly. Zheng had done his best anyway. They were convinced that Zheng's skills were inferior to David's.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>However, Zheng held his long emerald green sword horizontally across his chest, a faint smile appearing on his face. "We do need to end the battle, but I don't intend to use my life."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the internal momentum within his body began to mix crazily.</p>
