<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. The conflict between Luo Zheng and the Vastness Mountain ran pretty deep.</p>

  <p>Back then, if it hadn't been for Ying and Concubine Yan, he probably wouldn't have been able to leave the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng, the news that people from the Vastness Mountain were in command here was definitely bad news.</p>

  <p>But given the current situation, he doubted the Vastness Mountain would do anything rash to take revenge on him.</p>

  <p>Sinclair didn't notice Luo Zheng's crestfallen expression. Pointing downwards, he said excitedly, "Look! That's the Vastness Array!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked in the direction he pointed and saw that the ground below them had been excavated.</p>

  <p>A huge sword-shaped array was carved on the ground, and in the very center was a high tower. It was obviously newly built, its stone walls practically shining.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was studying the high tower, someone was looking up from a small window in the tower. It was Natasha, who was dressed in red.</p>

  <p>"The disciples in the Land of Sword Grief have gathered in the North Mysterious City one after another," Natasha said in a low voice. "The first group has already arrived at the front line."</p>

  <p>Behind her sat an old man in black. He had a hooked nose and drooping eyes, as though he loathed everything in existence. It was Holden, the one who had forcefully taken Luo Zheng away from the Dragon Path.</p>

  <p>"I think Luo Zheng will also go to the North Mysterious City," Holden said in a hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>"I've sent someone to check it out," Natasha said, the corners of her mouth curving upward gracefully. "This is the best time to take action.</p>

  <p>Everything's so chaotic in the North Unicorn Province. He'll never see it coming!"</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Zheng got on the wrong foot with the Vastness Mountain, he had never left the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Even when he went to the Chaotic Source World, there were powerful warriors protecting him all the time.</p>

  <p>Now that all the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were coming out, the Vastness Mountain was presented with an excellent opportunity.</p>

  <p>After passing by the Vastness Array, Luo Zheng and the others continued moving forward. In the distance, they could see a temporary pass? the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Even though it was just temporary, the pass was quite large in scale. After all, building a bunch of houses was a very simple task for warriors of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>In front of those buildings was a slender array.</p>

  <p>It stretched as far as the eye could see.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Sky Net?" asked Guzman as he stared at the slender array in the distance. "Woah. They resorted to this to prevent the Jin Wu from infiltrating..." He whistled in awe.</p>

  <p>The entire Sky Net Array stood across the northwest corner, forming a wall that climbed to the sky.</p>

  <p>As long as the Sky Net was not broken, no one from the Jin Wu could break through.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Sinclair replied, nodding his head. "A few days ago, the Jin Wu had tried to launch an attack, but they couldn't get past the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>Let's go down here."</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the six of them descended from the sky, the people below watched them closely.</p>

  <p>Many people guarded the Mountain Sea Pass. In addition to the Taiyi Guards, there were also many warriors of Other Shore Realm recruited from the Bloom Divine Province. Many Alliance Chiefs and Flag Masters from the Dragon City were also assigned here.</p>

  <p>"I heard that they are from the Land of Sword Grief!" one of them said, daring to hope.</p>

  <p>"So what? Like they'll help us at all..."</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>Faced against the Jin Wu, the people had learned to lose hope.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng and the others, having just arrived, didn't notice the pessimism at first. Guided by Sinclair, they headed straight for the largest building in the Mountain Sea Pass. There they were greeted by several Taiyi Generals.</p>

  <p>After brief introductions, Sinclair said seriously, "I'm in charge of the whole Mountain Sea Pass. I'm sorry if I offended you in the North Mysterious City. But now, you're here. I hope you will trust and obey all my orders."</p>

  <p>The disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were not happy to hear this, but they all knew that what he was saying was true, so they dared not speak out against him.</p>

  <p>Once more, Sinclair discussed the current situation to all who were present.</p>

  <p>Then, he allocated a room for each of the five disciples.</p>

  <p>Once they had settled everything, Sinclair let them go to explore the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wandered on one side of the Mountain Sea Pass and surveyed the area.</p>

  <p>He tried to memorize the environment and get a feel of the place.</p>

  <p>Right in front of the Mountain Sea Pass was a plain that resembled the shape of a snake. If they were attacked on the left or the right side, they could defend it while waiting for reinforcements. The terrain was ideal.</p>

  <p>This was probably why the Jin Wu was keenly targeting it.</p>

  <p>After wandering around for a while, Luo Zheng found that the Mountain Sea Pass was divided into two tiers. The upper tier was guarded by Taiyi Guards, while the lower tier was mostly guarded by warriors in the first stage or second stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know why, but as he passed by, he felt the gaze of the people below fixed on him. When he turned to look, he found that their eyes were filled with hatred.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt strange, but he eventually shrugged it off.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to return to his room, a voice suddenly came from the lower tier, "Master... Flag Master!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't been called that in a long time. The people who called him that were most likely from outside the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" a four-star Taiyi Guard from the upper tier snapped. "There is no 'Flag Master' here! This is a Taiyi General our Taiyi Guards have invited here! Go back now!"</p>

  <p>With his hand clasping a golden sword, Luo Zheng realized he had been promoted to a Taiyi General.</p>

  <p>In fact, because of this battle, every disciple in the Land of Sword Grief had been promoted to Taiyi Generals. It was only natural these Taiyi Guards treated Luo Zheng with respect.</p>

  <p>After being scolded by the four-star Taiyi Guard, the man from the lower tier dared not say anything more and retreated.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng shot the Taiyi Guard a cold look. Turning on his heel, he leapt onto the lower tier to catch up to the retreating man.</p>

  <p>"Jago!" Luo Zheng smiled warmly.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it was Jago of the Sword Light Palace. "Flag Master! It's really you!" the man cried excitedly. "I knew it was you!"</p>

  <p>The last time Luo Zheng passed by the Dragon City, the people who had stayed outside the city were nowhere to be found. This left him with a bad feeling.</p>

  <p>In such an emergency, he had figured that the Taiyi Heaven Palace might have put all these people into the battlefield. But, judging from their low cultivation level, the chance of them surviving this war was slim.</p>

  <p>"Where are the other disciples of the Sword Light Palace? And where is Monica?" Luo Zheng asked with concern.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's questions, Jago's lips trembled slightly, and his eyes shone as tears welled within them.</p>

  <p>Originally, Jago had been just a playboy in the Sword Light Palace, and had never really experienced any hardship. Even in the Dragon City, he was protected by Luo Zheng. After Luo Zheng left, Monica had become an Alliance Chief and took good care of the disciples of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>But not long ago, ever since they were recruited by the Taiyi Heaven Palace to serve in the North Unicorn Province, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace had been scattered. The past few days alone, Jago had suffered a lot and had stared death in the face more often than he'd have liked.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, Faegan was already eaten by the Jin Wu. They gobbled him whole, without leaving a single bone! As for the others, they have been guarding the Heavenly Wind Pass under the leadership of Alliance Chief Monica. But I'm afraid they don't have much time left..." At this point, a single tear streamed down his face. "The Taiyi Guards don't give a crap about us! They use us as bait!"</p>

  <p>The troops that guarded the North Unicorn Province could be divided into three categories. The strongest ones were the Taiyi Generals, such as Sinclair and Luo Zheng, who were with high-end fighting power. The second group was the Taiyi Guards. The major sword sects in the seven mountains also sent their disciples here, who would become the Taiyi Guards automatically once they joined the troops.</p>

  <p>The last group was the large number of warriors from outside the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>These people were weak, and were definitely not equipped to fight against the Jin Wu. Yet, someone had decided that they would be the ones to venture outside the Sky Net to lure the Jin Wu in.</p>

  <p>Using living people as bait worked well, for everyone except the people used as bait, of course.</p>
