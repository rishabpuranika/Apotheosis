<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3920 Devour </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In a fit of rage, Lamont's eyes flashed as he activated the full bloodline power in his body.</p>

  <p>An invisible yet tangible chill spread out.</p>

  <p>Although Yan tried to block the chill with the help of the Cloud Cover Array, it was much colder than before.</p>

  <p>The people on the edge of the Li Shan mountain were alright, but the disciples in the middle of the hill started to shiver from the cold. Many of them started releasing flames to prevent themselves from getting frostbite.</p>

  <p>Three blue spheres began to appear in the sky, one by one. They almost looked like blue suns, but the light they emitted was not warm at all.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt as though they had fallen into a cold hell.</p>

  <p>With the appearance of the three blue suns, the temperature in the Li Shan mountain dropped sharply.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Raising his hand above his head, Lamont lifted Luo Zheng up as though he were some sort of a sacrificial offering.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!</p>

  <p>Three Freezing Suns!"</p>

  <p>This had been Lamont's most powerful token before he figured out how to create the Cold Prison from the truth power.</p>

  <p>The three blue suns flashed an icy blue, and azure arrows made of ice started raining from them, shooting straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lamont thought that Luo Zheng had some kind of bloodline that could withstand, or even restrain, the coldness. Luo Zheng didn't seem to flinch in the face of the coldness, so Lamont was quite frustrated to have him as an opponent.</p>

  <p>However, Lamont believed there was a limit to Luo Zheng's bloodline power.</p>

  <p>With his truth power as a Chaos Ancient God, Lamont was confident in his own strength.</p>

  <p>Now that all his bloodline had been activated, he was determined to defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>Countless thick ice arrows shot down towards Luo Zheng. Anyone else would have been pierced to shreds in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>However, there seemed to be an invisible energy film on the surface of Luo Zheng's body. The ice arrows that touched this energy film bounced off him, leaving him unharmed.</p>

  <p>Lamont had already anticipated this, but he believed that the bloodline power within Luo Zheng's body would be used up sooner or later. With the Three Freezing Suns, Luo Zheng would be exhausted to death.</p>

  <p>However, what Lamont did not know was that Gerald and Judson had already tried this method. The two Chaos Ancient Gods had worked together to try to exhaust Luo Zheng's ancestry-level bloodline, but they ended up failing. Little did Lamont know that he too was doomed to fail.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>Countless huge ice arrows continued to shoot at Luo Zheng, and the ice debris falling from the sky froze some areas of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Even a thumb-sized piece of ice was extremely lethal.</p>

  <p>The creatures on the Li Shan mountain kept moving so as to avoid the collateral damage caused by the battle between Lamont and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since Lamont was so focused on dealing with Luo Zheng, Yan and the others were left idle. The leaders of the mountains and the sects quietly yet anxiously watched the battle in the sky.</p>

  <p>The battle between Luo Zheng and Lamont was going to determine the fate of the Li Shan mountain, so naturally, they were quite anxious.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is doomed to die under such heavy bombardments!"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't have the ability to fight back at all."</p>

  <p>"Alas, it's impossible for him to defeat a Chaos Ancient God."</p>

  <p>Many people fretted as they watched the powerful ice arrows rain on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just a single piece of ice debris that was spattered out could kill a warrior at the Holy Soul Realm. How could Luo Zheng survive from so many ice arrows?</p>

  <p>The ice arrows kept attacking Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Five minutes...</p>

  <p>Ten minutes...</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes...</p>

  <p>The crowd held their breath as they continued to watch the ice explode in front of Lamont, who held Luo Zheng in front of him. From the ground, they couldn't see what exactly was happening in the skies.</p>

  <p>With each minute that passed, their confusion grew.</p>

  <p>There had been countless ice arrows.</p>

  <p>If it were any Eternal Realm warrior, or even Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, they would have been smashed to pieces by now. But why was Lamont still attacking?</p>

  <p>More than an hour had passed.</p>

  <p>The scattered ice dregs left several mountains white with snow.</p>

  <p>The three blue suns in the sky gradually dimmed, and the ice arrows that fell down became weaker and weaker.</p>

  <p>"Lamont's bloodline power is starting to weaken," said King Ieuan, its brows furrowing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had managed to exhaust the bloodline power of a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Just how powerful was he?</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>Less and less arrows were shot out of the three suns, and it seemed they had slowed down, too.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally emerged from the explosions of ice, unharmed. The crowd let out a sigh of relief, and started cheering.</p>

  <p>Lamont looked at Luo Zheng in front of him, his eyes wide with fear.</p>

  <p>Stunned, he finally realized he had used up all his bloodline power, and yet, Luo Zheng still remained here unscathed. Did this mean Luo Zheng would cling to him for the rest of eternity?</p>

  <p>Lamont never thought that he was only half right. After Luo Zheng felt that his bloodline power began to weaken, his face spread towards his arm again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's head turned into a ring and passed through Lamont's arm, leaning on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Lamont was no stranger to danger, but he was still terrified in this moment.</p>

  <p>Just as Lamont attempted to pry the ring off, he shrieked in pain. Luo Zheng's ribs were like sharp blades, tearing through his body.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Lamont wanted to push Luo Zheng away with brute force. In terms of pure strength, without a doubt, Lamont was much stronger.</p>

  <p>However, before he could even try pushing Luo Zheng off, Lamont felt another sharp pain in his back. Craning his neck to see what had happened, Lamont nearly fainted at the sight.</p>

  <p>The ribs that had pierced through his body had grown barbs that were several thousand feet long. These barbs firmly locked his body with Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>"Monster...</p>

  <p>An incredible monster...</p>

  <p>I..."</p>

  <p>Lamont was finally too frightened to even speak fluently. He had never felt so scared in his life!</p>

  <p>His mind was whirling. Not knowing what to do, Lamont began to struggle desperately.</p>

  <p>But the more he tried, the deeper the barbs sank into his skin.</p>

  <p>No matter what Lamont tried, he couldn't get rid of the barbs.</p>

  <p>He felt as if he was the prey of a spider web, and was slowly devoured by the monster in front of him. Exhausted, his body gradually paralyzed and finally sank into darkness.</p>

  <p>Even Yan and King Ieuan couldn't help but show a trace of panic when they saw what Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>Was this truly the man they knew as Luo Zheng? Or was this some kind of monster?</p>

  <p>At the top of the Li Shan mountain, Luo Zheng lay on the side of a mountain.</p>

  <p>He had been conscious this whole time, but he had completely lost control of his body.</p>

  <p>After he swallowed Lamont, his body changed again.</p>

  <p>The wound on his chest gradually healed. A huge armor began to spread out from his chest, and many white hairs grew on his back.</p>

  <p>His arms became longer and stronger, resembling those of a gorilla.</p>

  <p>'Am I assimilated after I swallowed Lamont? Or did the ancestry-level bloodline do it on purpose?' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>With what had happened just now, his bodily transformations didn't surprise him anymore.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline could completely change the shape of one's body. Even if part of his body had been assimilated after he devoured Lamont, the ancestry-level bloodline should've been able to quickly repair it. However, it was possible there were other underlying reasons as to why his body took on some of Lamont's physical characteristics.</p>
