<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the battle began, nearly twenty of the Supreme Lords retreated at the same time in great haste, afraid that they would be caught up in the conflict.</p>

  <p>As for Yao, Ranell, and the other Supreme Lords, not only did they not leave, but they even charged forward at this moment...</p>

  <p>In the realm of world lords, it was difficult to determine the victor in a battle between these warriors.</p>

  <p>The reason was that the world lord had basically comprehended the spatial transference, and perhaps he wouldn't be able to beat his opponent, but it wasn't difficult for him to escape.</p>

  <p>After using the skill of spatial transference, the warrior had already traveled one million miles in only a moment! He was in a sense therefore unreachable.</p>

  <p>There had once been two world lords who had fought and chased each other for over ten years, and they had traveled through a hundred thousand supreme worlds… There was no way to delineate the battle zone, when the combatants could 'disappear' in an instant.</p>

  <p>As for the battle between two Supreme Lords, one of them could defeat the other. But it would be impossible for the Supreme Lord to kill the other if the opponent wanted to escape!</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord would be killed unless there were several Supreme Lords working in collusion, or if the few top-rank Supreme Lords that had the highest Law of Causality were involved!</p>

  <p>But now, the five Supreme Lords were trapped in a Desperate Melee within the open range of one hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Whether they made use of the spatial transference, their special fleeing skill, or other methods, they were unable to escape from the band of light which bound them, nor were they able to leave the area of one hundred miles. Despite these restrictions, they were able to jump around within this massive battle zone.</p>

  <p>Since the very start of the grand era, nothing like this had probably ever happened before!</p>

  <p>As such, battles within a hundred miles were exceptionally fierce!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Xun, who were standing within the fairy palace, silently looked up into the sky. This grain of sand which the fairy palace had transformed into was located in the very center of the battle! It was a whole new experience to have front row seats!</p>

  <p>In the sky, there was a dramatic play of all sorts of illusory colors and lights. Other than that, it was practically impossible to see anything else...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng simply couldn't understand this level of battle! The scope was too massive.</p>

  <p>The only thing he could discern was that those extremely profound Water Laws were being created by Myles. As for the shredded shadows, they might be from Gunter of the Demon Night...</p>

  <p>Even if he couldn't understand it, and could only distinguish the Law Power, the mass of light around Luo Zheng still gave him a great shock. It was mind boggling to observe the mammoth scale battle.</p>

  <p>As for Xun, her face was instead filled with extreme excitement...</p>

  <p>"Will Yao die here?" Xun asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>If Yao died here, it would be a release for Xun. Her enemy would then have been dealt with.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng had personally promised to help her kill Yao, there were a lot of risks and consequences involved in this undertaking.</p>

  <p>Xun knew that Luo Zheng would definitely do what he had vowed; but, right now, she seemed to have the intention of preventing Luo Zheng from taking that risk!</p>

  <p>Xun was the Queen of Killings, and her will was forged through slaughter. The Faith Energy she absorbed was mainly from slaughter, containing the most primitive killing intent of the Demon Night members. But now, even she was hesitant.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Yao wasn't also trapped inside the light band of the Desperate Melee.</p>

  <p>This band of light had been set up by the owner of the fairy palace and was not under anyone's control. It was a move that Saul had come up with at a whim, so it was not unnatural that Yao hadn't gotten trapped in it.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>In this blazing light, there were all sorts of sounds reverberating across the space.</p>

  <p>Slowly, the space began to crumble and vanish, little by little...</p>

  <p>It was hard to imagine the scope of the power spreading!</p>

  <p>Myles released the Light of Still Water, which was a form of light arrow that was about three feet wide, but possessed an infinite length. Every Light of Still Water stretched from both ends to the deep space. One end of the Light of Still Water pierced straight to the top of the universe, and the other end went straight through the sky, piercing into a supreme world. There might be many innocent creatures who were being killed...</p>

  <p>As for Addison, each time he launched the Dark Star Fist, a massive black hole would form in the air above them. That black hole would suddenly appear, sucking into it all of the surrounding energy and light!</p>

  <p>Every Supreme Lord was trying their best to fight! There was no regard for the cost of this titanic battle.</p>

  <p>But the Supreme Lords' life energy and defensive capabilities were too great. Even though they had endured such a terrifying attack, none of the Supreme Lords had died in the initial short period of time.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the heavens began to tremble again...</p>

  <p>More than twenty Supreme Lords outside of the battle raised their heads at the same time, their faces filled with both amazement and shock.</p>

  <p>Although, they couldn't clearly see what was happening on the battlefield, they knew that a Supreme Lord had now been killed!</p>

  <p>If a Supreme Lord died, the Heavenly Destiny would lose its position, and would inevitably cause the heavens to shake!</p>

  <p>Soon, a new Heavenly Destiny would be turned into the Crown of Destiny, which would randomly appear in any far flung corner of the universe.</p>

  <p>One hour later, the heavens began to tremble once again...</p>

  <p>"A second Supreme Lord has been killed," Supreme Lord Healum from the core sacred place of the Humanity Alliance said in a bleak voice which matched his cold face. There was a look of disbelief in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who Yolande had thought so highly of, had already tricked and killed two Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>After five minutes, the heavens shook once more...</p>

  <p>A third Supreme Lord died.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes, the fourth Supreme Lord also perished!</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord could live for over a hundred million years. If he used some additional method, it wasn't too difficult to live for two hundred million, or even three hundred million years. They were in a real sense close to being immortal!</p>

  <p>Before this, it had been a long time since any of the Supreme Lords had died.</p>

  <p>But today, in just four short hours, four Supreme Lords had perished.</p>

  <p>They had fought each other, and had been killed during the battle.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, they had been tricked and killed by Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Yao crossed her legs, floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Although her expression was calm and composed, she still looked extremely miserable...</p>

  <p>Excessive consumption of Faith Energy was a tremendous blow to her as well, and it left her drained.</p>

  <p>On the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand, a crack, two fingers in width, had appeared. The Saint Sky Armor draped over her body was all but destroyed.</p>

  <p>The heart-protecting mirror on her chest had already cracked in half, and the spikes of the armor's shoulder guard had also completely shattered.</p>

  <p>The pair of boots that had wrapped around her legs had already been completely torn apart, and there was a shocking, gaping wound on the side of her thigh. Fresh blood flowed down from the wound to drip on top of her toes, drop by drop. Before the blood reached the surface of the supreme world, it had already been air-dried and had dissipated in the wind...</p>

  <p>Yao had tried her best, but she still couldn't save Gunter.</p>

  <p>In truth, Gunter was the third Supreme Lord to have perished. After Gunter died, Yao left the center of the battle. The fighting there was just too intense, and even Yao couldn't withstand the frenzied attacks of the gathered Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>She had personally made a trip there. She would never have thought that not only would she fail to exterminate Xun and obtain the Crown of Destiny, but she also lost Gunter in the battle.</p>

  <p>From that point on, the Demon Night had then lost one more Supreme Lord. The Board of Elders' head had also died. Losing one more Supreme Lord had a great influence on the Demon Night. Because of this, if Yao returned to the Demon Night, she would probably be held accountable for the loss and failure by the other two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Yao let out a deep sigh. At this moment, a strong feeling of helplessness overwhelmed her mind. Luo Zheng and Xun were so close to her, yet she couldn't do anything to them! It was galling.</p>

  <p>She could do nothing but give up for the time being...</p>

  <p>Yao was really unwilling to accept the fact. Defeat was not a word she was used to.</p>

  <p>Right now, it wasn't just she who was disappointed and indignant.</p>

  <p>Of the five Supreme Lords, four had perished!</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord represented a race and with that Supreme Lord's support, that race could grow stronger within the 100, 000 supreme worlds of the universe. After the four Supreme Lords had died, how could the members of the races which were supported by them be willing to submit to such a situation?</p>
