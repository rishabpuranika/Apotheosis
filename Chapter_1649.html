<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sudden laughter made Luo Luo Zheng a bit uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>When they were in the outside world, Luo Luo Zheng had interacted with her quite frequently. Though they had never personally met, he remembered her as a rather lively girl.</p>

  <p>But after entering the Illusion Battlefield, she meticulously read the rules of the battlefield, growing more and more cold and detached.</p>

  <p>"Your performance was not bad, Luo Luo Zheng. You've already ranked 77th!" The girl's voice echoed from within Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>After a stunned moment, he asked, "Is there any news of Yan?"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>For a moment, the other was silent until a dissatisfied voice called out,</p>

  <p>"Why is this the first thing you say to me every time?"</p>

  <p>The comment made Luo Luo Zheng roll his eyes. 'Isn't this nonsense?'</p>

  <p>Though he could use his Roaring Token limitlessly, he had something else more important to do than telling her stories. Wasn't it all for getting her to help him investigate Yan's whereabouts, after all?</p>

  <p>"No news?" Luo Luo Zheng still asked.</p>

  <p>As indifferent as ever, the girl replied, "The divine land is much larger than you can imagine. I sent back the news a few years ago, but I haven't heard from them yet." Helpless, the mysterious girl could only explain this to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A look of disappointment surfaced on Luo Zheng's face. With a sigh, he asked,</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? Why did you suddenly appear?"</p>

  <p>Originally, he wanted to examine the bamboo slips, just when the mysterious girl's consciousness suddenly popped up.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I'm personally presiding over the Illusion Battlefield. Aren't you going to ask for my help?" she asked him with a knowing smile.</p>

  <p>"No need," Luo Luo Zheng immediately declined.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng wasn't very clear on the true meaning behind the Illusion Battlefield, he knew that this was the place where the talents of the Soul Sea Realm competed. Since he had entered the battlefield prepared to rely on his own strength? he didn't rely on the cyan dragon nor did he rely on Xun. So why would he need anyone else's help?</p>

  <p>Eventually, he knew he had to face those ace talents and the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Those like Lucille after the fusion, or Lone, perhaps. But when a martial artist was born, he could only rely on himself in the end. One might be able to show off his strength with others' help, but that was still only others' help.</p>

  <p>"Don't be like this. I can truly help you," the mysterious girl continued.</p>

  <p>"I said there's no need," Luo Luo Zheng said with a frown. "I only need you to find Yan's location. That alone is enough."</p>

  <p>"?" Suddenly, the other side fell silent.</p>

  <p>In the center of these three blood-red castles, deep in the skies above, there floated a ring-shaped cloud.</p>

  <p>Deep within the cloud was a palace that seemed to be carved from crystal.</p>

  <p>At the side of the palace, a young girl was sitting on the railing.</p>

  <p>This young girl wore a light blue blouse along with a green pleated dress, flower patterns scattered all over it. Her long and plump legs hung down along the railing in the clouds. From the back, the small shoulders seemed to be cut out just as she looked unmistakably lonely.</p>

  <p>She was, of course, the host of the Illusion Battlefield, the mysterious girl who had been listening to Luo Zheng's stories.</p>

  <p>At this moment, her cheeks were puffed up just as her face was filled with indignation.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen such a person. Didn't you know of my good intentions?</p>

  <p>Humph! I don't care if you live or die!"</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Luo Zheng entered the Illusion Battlefield, the mysterious girl's gaze fell upon Luo Luo Zheng for the first time? her gaze seemed to follow him from the start to finish, from one main city to the other, and all the way to the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>At this stage, she still had much trust in Luo Zheng's strength. In spite of her paying close attention, she didn't help.</p>

  <p>After reaching the second stage, she decided to take the initiative and help Luo Luo Zheng. At any rate, he should still be considered her friend.</p>

  <p>Though she chatted with Luo Luo Zheng for many years, using the Roaring Token, she didn't actually know his personality that well.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he tended to be pedantic? he didn't pursue absolute fairness. After all, this world would never have been fair from birth.</p>

  <p>Talent, luck, background?</p>

  <p>There were too many factors affecting one's fate. A completely fair world simply did not exist.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng knew that the Illusion Battlefield was also a review of Luo Luo Zheng himself. This opportunity only happened once every grand era. He didn't want to miss the opportunity, and he also didn't want to use cheating to obtain his property.</p>

  <p>The young girl frowned as her beautiful eyes moved, then a mischievous smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>"You don't need me to help you. Humph! I won't let anybody refuse me.</p>

  <p>No one can dare disobey me."</p>

  <p>For almost six grand eras, she had been in charge of this universe. One grand era was 3.6 billion years? six grand eras were 21.6 billion years.</p>

  <p>To her race, longevity was pretty much an eternal existence.</p>

  <p>In the river of time, she often sealed herself.</p>

  <p>A hundred million years was nothing but the flick of her finger. Time flowed faster, or rather, it leapt within her consciousness. Such was the instinct of her race.</p>

  <p>The young girl had passed several grand ears just as such.</p>

  <p>In this grand era, the boredom finally took over when she woke up in the heavens.</p>

  <p>Singing was good for boredom.</p>

  <p>She later found that her singing almost had the entire universe screwed.</p>

  <p>Finally, when the group of Supreme Lords begged her, she stopped the melodies.</p>

  <p>Though she wanted to use the Roaring Token to chat, the Supreme Lords held their Roaring Tokens extra tightly? they were afraid they would waste even a single one.</p>

  <p>In truth, she had secretly made known the method to make the Roaring Token. Otherwise, though the universe was wide and there were many creatures to live in it, it would still be too quiet for her who was trapped in the heavens.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the number of Roaring Tokens increased and the universe turned more and more lively. But no one was willing to respond to her.</p>

  <p>She was still utterly bored.</p>

  <p>Right until Luo Luo Zheng appeared.</p>

  <p>The moment he was in sight, this guy attracted her attention.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be looking for a girl named Yan, but even after shouting all over the universe through the Roaring Token, he got no response.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, he began arguing with two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Then, he began to count.</p>

  <p>At the time, this mysterious girl thought that Luo Luo Zheng was quite an interesting guy.</p>

  <p>She was also curious about where Luo Luo Zheng got so many Roaring Tokens. Or did this mean that he had a Roaring Token that could be used for limitless times just as she did?</p>

  <p>Still, she had no interest in investigating how Luo Zheng's Roaring Token had come about. So long as the guy was willing to talk to her, she would be satisfied.</p>

  <p>Afterward, she listened to Luo Luo Zheng tell stories one after another after she promised to help him find his sister. These few years, she no longer fell into deep sleep, or rather, she refused to let herself fall into one. With this, her sleeping time was cut down to less than a year or half a year instead of the millions or even hundreds of millions of years before.</p>

  <p>Now that she had made her decision, she slowly raised her right hand until a purple halo appeared around her thin arm. The instant it appeared, it silently spread out. Without being noticed, it silently enveloped the entire Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no clue what this mysterious girl was planning.</p>

  <p>When her voice faded away, he released a breath of relief. Once again, he examined the bundle of golden bamboo slips and realized that this was used to imprint the heavens' law onto the sculpture.</p>

  <p>But this heavens' law required 500 million Illusion Points in order to exchange for it. The news left Luo Luo Zheng feeling dizzy.</p>

  <p>Even if it was the first-ranked warrior of the Illusion Battlefield, he couldn't possibly have obtained 500 million Illusion Points, could he?</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng turned around and selected the bamboo slips of power, defense, and speed.</p>

  <p>Someone had concentrated all his Illusion Points into one kind of slips, but Luo Luo Zheng was still doing what he could to achieve balance. What Luo Luo Zheng didn't know, though, was that he had already been manipulated by the mysterious girl during the exchange.</p>

  <p>The amount of Illusion Points he exchanged was different from that of the others.</p>

  <p>    </p>
