<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was customary that the few high-ranked warriors were the deciding factor of a sect victory.</p>

  <p>As long as he was not slain, Eddie alone was enough to win the war.</p>

  <p>However, his potential victory didn't exactly guarantee him the complete control of the result.</p>

  <p>Even if he killed Zheng, Yudie, and the Ancient Tycoon, who was to help him take over the Oracle City?</p>

  <p>There were still hundreds of thousands of warriors left in the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Was he to kill them one by one?</p>

  <p>Usually, warriors of different ranks had to fight with their counterparts of the opposing side in a war.</p>

  <p>It was Eddie who won the battle of the upper rank. But after that, in just a drop of a hat, Margaret intervened and managed to eliminate all the middle and lower-ranked warriors of the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Exasperation was now evident on Eddie's face.</p>

  <p>"Woman, you're courting death!"</p>

  <p>Eddie yelled, his face red in displeasure.</p>

  <p>That time, he didn't hesitate one bit and immediately reached out his hand towards Margaret. He could crush that woman into fragments with just one of his limbs.</p>

  <p>Margaret only blinked in response, her eyebrows furrowed slightly. Her beautiful face revealed a trace of contempt. She reached out her hands and pulled Zheng and Yudie towards her, after which they three all disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>"The Purple Power World, right? That's nothing impressive!" Eddie sneered.</p>

  <p>Since he had taken part in helping Marilyn activate her Purple Power Body, he knew everything about it. Unfortunately for Eddie, the number of swords that Margaret had summoned was beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>After all, Marilyn had only been able to summon a hundred swords at most back then. Margaret, however, who was only at the early stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, could summon tens of thousands of times more swords than Marilyn. That was something Eddie had never anticipated.</p>

  <p>Right after he insulted Margaret, Eddie extended his arm to the spot where she had been. Eddie thought that Margaret must be hiding in the Purple Power World, but she was still connected to this world through a space node. Once he attacked that space node, Margaret could be forced out of where she was hiding.</p>

  <p>Back then in the Martial Arts Contest, Zheng had been at his wits' end when Marilyn hid in the Purple Power World. In the end, Zheng had relied on the Space Law to find the space node, and that was how he had chased her out of the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Thinking that he could do just the same, Eddie frowned upon discovering that there was nothing in his hand.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>Eddie had clearly seen the place where Margaret had disappeared into thin air, and he had thought that the space node was there. How did that woman avoid his attack?</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say that I was courting death?" Margaret's indifferent voice rang out in the air. Then, she continued, "Was that mere exaggeration? Just try to kill me if you can!"</p>

  <p>And of course, Eddie wasn't the kind of man who easily gave up. It was essential for him to take over the Oracle City, but his army had been completely destroyed by that woman. Over a hundred thousand of the most outstanding independent warriors in the Central Region had been murdered.</p>

  <p>Gathering so many warriors in a short amount of time was going to be a challenge.</p>

  <p>To add, how many warriors were willing to team up with him knowing that he had paid such a heavy price for attacking the Oracle City?</p>

  <p>Despite his lifelessness, Zheng was the ultimate proof of victory, and Eddie didn't intend to return empty-handed. How could he allow Zheng's body to be taken away by Margaret? For it to happen was unacceptable.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make you regret this!"</p>

  <p>Eddie let out a cold snort and threw out a punch at the air. As space fluctuated under his great strength, he looked around for that space node.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there was no sign of it.</p>

  <p>Punching a few more times, Eddie's eyes lit up with exultation as the space node appeared right in front of him.</p>

  <p>But just as soon as he rushed over, the space node disappeared again.</p>

  <p>"Idiot," Margaret sneered.</p>

  <p>Eddie didn't respond at all. He knew it was a waste of time to crosstalk with that woman. And since he had failed to get his hands on the space node, he was gradually becoming more agitated.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>What a strange world.</p>

  <p>There were numerous giant swords floating in the sky. They were arranged in neat rows, looking endless as they extended to the edge of the horizon.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Genuine Dragon World, the Purple Power World was different in many aspects. After all, the Genuine Dragon World was a complete great world, and it could be considered as one of the largest great worlds out of all the many others.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World, on the other hand, was a small broken world.</p>

  <p>Within it was a set of rules that were completely different from those in the outside world.</p>

  <p>Margaret placed Zheng's body on the ground and pulled Yudie away from him. She was not an openhanded type of woman. Even though Yudie's and Zheng's bodies were both icy cold, Margaret felt intense jealousy growing in her heart when she saw them clutched tightly to each other.</p>

  <p>After she laid Zheng's body flat on the ground, Margaret knelt down beside him and held his cold hand. She didn't know what else she could do to help him.</p>

  <p>"Are… Are you here? Xun?" Margaret hesitated for a moment and begged, "Xun, please."</p>

  <p>Soon, some rays of red light began to condense and Xun's figure appeared. After sparing a cold glance at Margaret, she turned to look at Zheng, concern painted all over her face. She then asked, "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"What happened to Zheng?" Margaret asked with an anxious expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," Xun replied in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's straightforward answer, Margaret's mouth slightly opened in shock. Her lips moved but no words came out. She was obviously overwhelmed with sadness.</p>

  <p>Observing her mournful expression, Xun suddenly smirked and said,</p>

  <p>"I was just lying to you. I don't know what will happen to him, either. All that we can do is to wait."</p>

  <p>Margaret gripped Zheng's hand tightly and continued to ask, "Zheng won't die, right? Tell me, Xun!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure, but I hope he doesn't die," Xun replied, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Fragment released a strange light. Even after it was activated, it only released a tiny portion of its power. The Heavenly Fragment was not a panacea. It had saved Zheng's life because the Life and Death Wind contained a Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>A Law of Causality could be unraveled when another Law of Causality was applied.</p>

  <p>Everything alive would definitely end up dead.</p>

  <p>That was the simplest Law of Causality about life and death. To most ordinary mortals, that law was substantial and important.</p>

  <p>However, it was not the strongest.</p>

  <p>It could easily be unraveled when another Law of Causality was applied.</p>

  <p>"A new life could be born from the dead body."</p>

  <p>That law was controlled only by the super legendary beast, the phoenix.</p>

  <p>Although the Phoenix was labeled as such, it wasn't mostly feared for its fighting ability. In comparison, the strength of a Genuine Phoenix was inferior to a Genuine Dragon, but the phoenix controlled the Law of Causality about rebirth. Death was the beginning of their rebirth, so the Genuine Phoenix was considered an immortal creature. They could only be killed when a stronger Law of Causality was applied.</p>

  <p>Compared to all the other Laws of Causality, it was considered low-level.</p>

  <p>It was luck that could decide Zheng's fate. He didn't necessarily have to grasp a Law of Causality. He could stay alive if he could unravel the Law of Causality contained in the Life and Death Wind with the help of another Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>Faint energy from the Heavenly Fragment had flowed into Zheng's body, and his consciousness had been connecting with that energy.</p>

  <p>At this time, Zheng had been staying in a special state. He was analyzing the information within that energy.</p>

  <p>The information was too much for Zheng to take.</p>

  <p>A heavenly law had recorded three point six billion years of history. In those specific records, one could find all that had happened during the great era, the one hundred thousand great worlds, the heavenly bodies, and the various outlands.</p>

  <p>Too many things could occur during those years, and not one creature could ever have the capability to record them all.</p>

  <p>For instance, the world that Zheng was in had a historical record of only tens of thousands of years. Any earlier history was completely blank in books.</p>

  <p>This was only tens of thousands of years, let alone three point six billion years.</p>

  <p>However, the Heavenly Fragment wasn't the entire heavenly law. Moreover, Zheng had only absorbed a tiny bit of the energy it had released.</p>

  <p>'What should I know?</p>

  <p>Why should I know it?' Zheng's consciousness muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>There was no one to guide Zheng. Right now, he could not communicate with anyone, including the cyan dragon and Xun. He could only rely on himself.</p>

  <p>As he continued to analyze, he gradually felt a sign of emotion contained in the Heavenly Fragment.</p>

  <p>'The heavenly law has emotions?'</p>

  <p>A strange thought suddenly popped into Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Xun had once told him that it wasn't a fragment of the present heavenly law, but of the previous one.</p>

  <p>From this small fragment, Zheng could feel a hint of helplessness and sorrow.</p>

  <p>It was said that the heavenly law would complete a cycle every 3.6 billion years. If this was true, why had the previous heavenly law broken into pieces? Who had shattered it and broken it into pieces? That question appeared in Zheng's mind as he went on to analyze the power of the Heavenly Fragment.</p>
