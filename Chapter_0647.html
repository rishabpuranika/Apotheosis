<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 647 The Upper World (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At that point in time when the light enveloped Zheng's body, he heard some footsteps inching closer from behind him. As it turned out, it was actually the young master of the Xue Clan, whose cultivation was at the later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. He had managed to breeze through and reach the sixth floor!</p>

  <p>Beneath that blinding light, Zheng felt as though his entire body had been set ablaze and burnt down into cinders. From what he could make out of it, his body was being reduced to ashes and his physical form was fading away slowly into nothingness.</p>

  <p>"You?!" This plan of the young master of the Xue Clan had already been set in motion so long ago. He went through lengths just to reach Zheng in time. He took great efforts to chase Zheng behind him. But at the very end, he had been just a couple of seconds too late, and the last thing he saw when he got there was Zheng's smiling face fading into the light.</p>

  <p>A few moments before Zheng had entirely vanished, the cyan dragon was able to transfer a fragment of his soul directly to him and alter the divine texture to just the bare minimum without getting caught.</p>

  <p>The second Zheng disappeared completely, a white light materialized right above the Dragon Soar Arena, beaming upward into the sky. It passed through a chunk of clouds, strong wind, and dense space cracks, vanishing at the edge of the sky.</p>

  <p>"What the...?! That was amazing! The young master of the Xue Clan really managed to pull it off! It seems he has already been transferred somewhere else!" Letting out a sigh of relief, the Lady Poison-blood's eyes were glistening in amusement. As she stared up at the Dragon Soar Arena, she wore an enthusiastic look on her face.</p>

  <p>It had been long rumored that the Dragon Soar Arena was actually the channeling passageway of the vast world built by the Genuine Dragon. A person who had access to it could be transferred straight into the Upper World. This just went to verify that the legend was indeed true. The passageway really existed!</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of the world Zheng had been in had no means of flying into the Upper World, not even if they somehow managed to pass through the Nine Thunder Turns. All throughout the past millennia, no one had ever flown into the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Not a single person, living or dead, could understand the logic behind it.</p>

  <p>There were various explanations how the Dragon Soar Arena had been revered that much by the grade-four or five sects. One of those reasons was that it could be of great help for their disciples to improve their cultivation skill. The Lucky Light of the Genuine Dragon had an even greater effect compared to that of the other pills out in the market for strengthening their cultivation ability. And the Lucky Light had no side effect whatsoever!</p>

  <p>One other reason was that the Dragon Soar Arena was, in reality, a ticket to the Upper World. Humans had a chance to step foot in the Upper World by passing through the road located in the Genuine Dragon world.</p>

  <p>A lot of the strongest warriors standing at the apex couldn't find a way to break through and reach even higher up even though they had been lucky enough to persevere at the Nine Thunder Turns. With a lifetime spanning a couple millennia, they eventually reached the end of their lives and withered away becoming figures only existing in the history books.</p>

  <p>Life span was a limitation which mere human beings could never hope to overcome in this world. If they could get to the Upper World, only then would they be capable of existing at a higher form. It gave the warriors living on this side of the world something to strive for, an end goal.</p>

  <p>Literally seconds ago, Lady Poison-blood discovered that the young master of the Xue Clan had stepped foot in the Dragon Soar Arena. Now, after gazing upon the white light rising toward the sky, she was under the assumption that it must be the work of the young master of the Xue Clan.</p>

  <p>Little did she know that the young master of the Xue Clan had actually been left behind, standing on the sixth tier, fuming with intense rage.</p>

  <p>"This is so confusing! What is happening here?" the young master of the Xue Clan yelled quite furiously. He had already lodged the dragon-shaped jade pendant into the slot beside the divine texture just as he was supposed to. However, for some reason, the divine texture still hadn't been activated.</p>

  <p>'I'm quite certain that the guy has been transmitted away a little while ago. Just how in the world was he able to make it work without having a dragon-shaped jade pendant in his possession?! Why isn't it working?</p>

  <p>What am I doing wrong? Why can't I do it?!' the young master of the Xue Clan thought, beginning to get frustrated. There was a grim look that crept onto his face. One thing he wasn't aware of was that moments before Zheng had left, the cyan dragon managed to stealthily alter the divine texture a little bit.</p>

  <p>After a couple of attempts and pondering about it for quite some time, the young master of the Xue Clan took off the dragon-shaped jade pendant. In that instant upon taking off the jade pendant, the round divine texture started lighting up once again.</p>

  <p>"I made it work!" the young master of the Xue Clan screamed his lungs out feeling so exhilarated. Hurriedly pacing toward the light, it didn't take too long until his body began to fade and he ended up vanishing into thin air.</p>

  <p>Yudie, along with everyone else noticed the light beaming from the top of the Dragon Soar Arena again, and they all shot a baffled look at it. 'A while ago, a person has just been transmitted away. So, why is it lighting up again out of nowhere?' everybody was wondering deep inside.</p>

  <p>Out of the people who happened to witness the second beam of light coming from the arena, it was solely the three warriors in the Internal Elixir Realm that were delighted to see it once again. 'Our young master has successfully been transmitted as well!" the warriors thought to themselves. The three knew fully well that the first light could only mean that the strange guy who went into the Dragon Soar Arena first had been successfully transmitted and not their young master. They were quite concerned about their young master upon seeing the first beam of light.</p>

  <p>But right now, their minds were finally put at ease. Given that they failed to secure the Dragon Soar Arena, they were still fortunate enough to send their young master to obtain some experience in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Supposing that their young master somehow managed to break into the Virtual Tribulation Realm, they would have a chance to bring the Xue Clan from grade three all the way to grade four.</p>

  <p>Then, from out of the blue, something they weren't anticipating took place. Everyone saw the light gleaming once more and a figure materialized from that light, one who appeared to be in a precarious state. Tossing and turning in the air for some time before he came to a halt, he eventually stood up on the ground. Examining his surroundings, he asked, "Where the hell have I been transmitted to?"</p>
