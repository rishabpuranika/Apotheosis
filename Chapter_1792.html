<br/><br/>

  <p>At the same time, in the hall, Supreme Lord Mirage said to Luo Zheng, "That supreme sorcerer is going to be in deep trouble…"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, a space crack exploded. An inky black tail glided out from it, instantly coiled around Supreme Lord Mirage and pulled him into the back of the space…</p>

  <p>The chaotic situation had finally stabilized thanks to the arrival of Supreme Lord Mirage.</p>

  <p>Normally, with the two Supreme Lords present, the sorcerer race would not dare to make another move. So no one expected the situation to change so soon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others were also stunned by this sudden phenomenon.</p>

  <p>In reality, the Celestial Position had foreseen this when they allowed Luo Zheng and the others to leave. That was exactly why they had sent the two Supreme Lords to protect them from the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race itself was not particularly powerful in the universe but they were suddenly invading many supreme worlds in order to wake up fierce beasts from remote ages.</p>

  <p>It was not like the sorcerer race wanted to conquer the supreme worlds, but the beasts from remote ages were all hidden in the depths of certain supreme worlds. This was the main reason why they wanted to seize these supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage and Supreme Lord Sky were quietly guarding Luo Zheng and the rest, and before the supreme sorcerer could make his move, they had already launched their counterattack. However, the two Supreme Lords did not expect the sorcerer race to also come prepared for a war.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon, also known as Candle Dragon, was originally a variant of the Genuine Dragon. It was a sacred beast in the Upper World, possessing strength comparable to a Genuine Dragon!</p>

  <p>The two Supreme Lords fought valiantly with a supreme sorcerer and a Torch Dragon on the back of this great world!</p>

  <p>Back in the hall, the faces of the people from the Central Region turned pale as everybody was shell-shocked.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the eight Godly Geniuses were also aghast.</p>

  <p>In the battle between the Supreme Lords and the supreme sorcerer, if the people got swept away in the aftermath of the collision, they would be crushed like butterflies in a storm. In every war, collateral damage was inevitable.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the sorcerer race preferred to hide in the shadows of the world. So they had drawn the two Supreme Lords into the back of the space. If they were to fight in the sky above the Cloud Hall, the entire Central Region would probably be annihilated in an instant!</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, take us back now!" Nathan yelled immediately.</p>

  <p>"Yes, take us back to the Celestial Position or the Lie Clan!" added Lawson.</p>

  <p>From their point of view, this was a very dangerous place and a hostile environment, so naturally, they wanted to flee at the first chance they got. They thought that they were not responsible for the great world turning upside down.</p>

  <p>Lucille and the rest also showed a desire to escape. To put it bluntly, these eight people were countless times more important than the warriors in this great world…</p>

  <p>The truth was that there still was another way of leaving this great world, and that was to nullify the effects of the Moon Shrouding Stone so that the great world would expel them from it. In other words, they would be able to "ascend" into the Upper World. However, there was uncertainty about which channel of the supreme world to enter. Who knew which supreme world they would be transported to? Suppose the supreme world they landed in was suffering the invasion of the sorcerer race, it would be a dead end for them!</p>

  <p>Only Zheng's miraculous Teleportation Token could allow them to return safely. It seemed to be the most foolproof method.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered constantly…</p>

  <p>Nathan's suggestion was not wrong. Fleeing the situation was the correct thing to do right now. They could come up with an alternate strategy with regards to the sorcerers later.</p>

  <p>As Godly Geniuses, the most important beings of the universe, they bore the responsibility of saving the universe, as well as fulfilling the ardent expectations of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was not going to stand by and watch his homeland being completely obliterated by these nasty creatures.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Noticing Zheng's hesitation, Nathan took out a spear and held it against Zheng's forehead, and goaded him, "Now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept his cool and his expression did not change at all. He looked around at the warriors of the Central Region's various sects, and found that all of them had a bitter expression on their faces. They knew that this disaster was brought about by Luo Zheng and they would loathe him for it if he chose to just leave.</p>

  <p>However, in this place, these people were as insignificant as ants. At the moment, their pleas to Luo Zheng to stay did not hold any weight. This group of masters at the Spirit Supreme Realm were so desperate to avoid the disaster that even Luo Zheng couldn't stop them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng realized there was no use wasting time in any more debates with them. He flicked his finger and the Teleportation Token popped out from his space ring.</p>

  <p>"Whoever wants to leave can do so on their own! I am going to stay here anyway," he declared.</p>

  <p>He had devised a brilliant plan in his mind. The others could enter the Teleportation Token while he placed Ning Yudie, Geoffrey and the rest in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>But before Luo Zheng could activate the Teleportation Token, a cold voice rang out:</p>

  <p>"Haha…! None of you can leave!"</p>
