<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 756 Attitude Of The Elders (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In order to solve the mystery of the missing disciple from the Black Mountain Sect, the World Commercial Alliance had brought it upon themselves to send several people to the Dragon Soar Arena and waited for results. However noble their mission was, not a single soul from their team returned, yet none of them had also died. With the intention of preventing the warriors from staying in the Upper World, the World Commercial Alliance even tried to threaten them with the condition that if they did not return within a certain period of time, their families would be killed.</p>

  <p>Even with the grave threat issued by them, not a single person had returned from the Upper World. Although the phenomenon was considered as enormously strange, they still did not find the answer to the occurrences of the missing warriors trapped inside the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>It did not occur even a little bit to Dillon before that Luo Luo Zheng would be the one to ultimately solve the confounding mystery. It turned out that it was not the case that those people who entered the place did not want to return. Rather, they were forced to stay there, dreadfully imprisoned for a thousand years.</p>

  <p>Dillon broke out in a cold sweat at the new found knowledge. 'And to think I have also been prepared to travel to the Upper World myself, ' he thought with a wince and let out a breath he did not know he was holding. It was a fortunate thing that Haber had advised and also convinced him to give up on the idea of going there.</p>

  <p>With slightly trembling hands, Dillon then passed the crumpled piece of paper to Hobbes and Haber. After the two of them had read it, they immediately looked at one another in shock. "The Dragon Soar Arena is a big trap!" they both exclaimed at the same time. Both men had somehow noticed that the place was rather shady before, and this just affirmed their suspicions. If Luo Luo Zheng had not revealed the truth about the Dragon Soar Arena, there would be more people imprisoned in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"Wait a second," Haber said softly as a thought suddenly sprung from his mind. The man normally did not voice out his opinions as much as his comrades, but he was the most intuitive and smartest one among the three.</p>

  <p>Clasping his hands on his lap and furrowing his eyebrows, he continued,</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, how could Luo Luo Zheng have returned safely from the Genuine Dragon World?"</p>

  <p>"Hmm, well?"</p>

  <p>As Dillon shook his head, he pondered on the implication of what Haber had just stated. "I will find an opportunity to ask Luo Luo Zheng." Shrugging his shoulders as he let out a short chuckle, Dillon piped up once more, "That kid has more secrets than the warriors at the Life and Death Realm."</p>

  <p>After the small group of Cloud Hall members exited the Martial Arts Contest and left with them a lasting impression, they headed straight for the transmission array of Oracle City. A huge transmission array was nestled between the Oracle City and Cloudy City in order for transportation from the city to another to be more convenient. The particular transmission array was also built by the World Commercial Alliance for this exact purpose, for they could go back to their respective sect via the technology.</p>

  <p>Through the transmission array, the group returned to the Cloud Hall. As they walked through their gates, the elders of the sect bowed in respect and welcomed them at the main entrance of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Welcome back, Master Ning!" the elders greeted them simultaneously with dutiful smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>As soon as Ning Yudie stepped foot onto the ground, she immediately addressed the people in the area as she asserted in a loud voice which exuded authority, "Cloud Hall is now on alert!"</p>

  <p>The elders showed visible astonishment on their faces as they had picked up on the urgent tone of their leader. The way she held herself was also different, they had noticed, as Ning Yudie appeared to be unnerved and slightly rattled. It was definitely unusual that she displayed such behavior. They were not certain about what exactly was going on that caused the Cloud Hall to enter a state of emergency.</p>

  <p>"Master Ning, what happened?"</p>

  <p>Emanuel, one of the elders, inquired with his voice full of anxiety. The somber faces of the people behind her gave him a sinking feeling of how extreme the situation was.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Emanuel's question, Ning Yudie hurried forward and moved closer to the elders of the sect. "There will be a strong enemy!" she explained as she wrung her hands in front of her and clasped her palms together, as if in prayer.</p>

  <p>"A strong enemy?" many elders stuttered as they stared at Ning Yudie with incredulous expressions on their faces. Admittedly, there were not many individuals that could make the Cloud Hall view them as powerful enemies. For such an opponent to exist, they must have tremendous skills and boundless courage to challenge the Cloud Hall. 'Maybe it could be the Ethereal Spirit Sect?' one of them deeply considered. 'The World Commercial Alliance, maybe?' another elder pondered, thinking hard of who could be the strong enemy that made Ning Yudie so frazzled. However, their guesses were highly doubtful as the relationships that the Cloud Hall maintained with the two powers were supported with mutual respect and diplomatic. Other than the two of them, they were not aware of other strong enemies that they could possible face.</p>

  <p>Before they could deliberate even further and ask for an additional explanation from the pacing woman, Ning Yudie smoothed her expression into that of resoluteness and did not bother talking about the issue anymore. The lady coldly addressed the people, "Let Felix come to my palace!" With her robes billowing behind and her hair fluttering against the breeze, she briskly walked away and finally entered the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Reading the tense atmosphere that suddenly surrounded the place, her entourage silently followed behind her, not bothering to talk with the elders.</p>

  <p>The strides of Imogen, Luo Luo Zheng, and the others, kept up with the woman except for Saint Morphens who had stayed back.</p>
