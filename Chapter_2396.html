<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2396 Truth Of Dark And Light Chaos </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Still in the air, Zheng sent Augustus spiraling down with a roll of his body.</p>

  <p>He had been preparing for this for a long time. Therefore the power of his strikes should never be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Caught off guard, Augustus wasn't even able to react to this surprise attack.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Quietly, Augustus just lay in a huge pit, eyes staring out in awe at what just happened.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng landed steadily at the edge of the pit. A faint smile appeared on his face, and a hint of excitement flashed from his eyes.</p>

  <p>When he used the Eight Smoky Melodies a few moments before, Zheng discovered that he could fuse the Truth of Godly Way into this particular skill.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had been considering the use of the Truth of Godly Way recently, he wasn't in a hurry to totally grasp it as the side hall was occupied by Joy. Thus, his understanding of the Truth of Godly Way was still very shallow, and it didn't even amount to Geoffrey's understanding of it.</p>

  <p>However, the principle of the Eight Smoky Melodies was free to be used.</p>

  <p>So while employing it, Zheng managed to fuse the Truth of Godly Way as if it were an instinct already.</p>

  <p>Unlike Joy who had understood half of the Truth of Godly Way, Zheng had no idea that the Truth of Godly Way had to follow the natural course.</p>

  <p>Now that he was fully aware and capable of harnessing this great power, it excited him to have a new skill.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, Yudie had been very angry with the sparring, but seeing Zheng smash Gus into the ground left a smile on her face. 'Serves you right, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>"This is... The Truth of Godly Way! Where in the world did you learn it?" Hallet's eyes were full of disbelief.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Augustus was just about to ask the same thing but he was frozen in shock. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it soon after so he didn't look too stupid.</p>

  <p>Although his original plan was to pull punches to let Zheng have a counterattack, he was a consummate True God, anyway.</p>

  <p>Originally he wanted to teach Zheng a lesson, but it turned out that it was the other way around. It was too embarrassing for Augustus.</p>

  <p>He didn't care about Zheng. To him, Zheng was a young boy from the universe. Even if he had inherited the fairy palace, he was a mere newcomer to the divine land. Would he even be so lucky to already have the opportunity to learn the Truth of Godly Way? This was unfair!</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way was considered such a rare thing in the divine land. Even the Holy Beings rarely had the chance to learn about it, not to mention the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>In fact, both Augustus and Hallet had already learned about the Truth of Godly Way years ago.</p>

  <p>Back then, Holy Jay had handed a golden Sanskrit word to Bromley.</p>

  <p>Then, Bromley spent much time prying into its deepest secrets, and eventually obtained an abridged cultivation method from it. This came to be Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, something that Bromley cultivated himself.</p>

  <p>This particular cultivation method was translated from the Sanskrit, but it was only a small portion found at the middle of the entire text.</p>

  <p>But Bromley, with his remarkable skill and talent, had already arranged an array of Eight Diagrams to calculate it. With the help of Mike's calculation abilities, he managed to complete the entirety of the text soon enough.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way was so refined that a single mistake in wording would affect it altogether, causing it to lose its power.</p>

  <p>This particular Truth of Godly Way, revised intricately by Bromley, was certainly not the real Truth of Godly Way. However, it was extremely powerful and had to be used with caution.</p>

  <p>The Godly Ways that were cultivated by Hallet and Augustus were all passed down from Bromley. They benefited a lot as they cultivated the Truth of Godly Way revised by their talented, skillful master.</p>

  <p>Though the two disciples were completely pleased with it already, Bromley still had a few doubts and worries. "This Truth of Godly Way is just a small paper boat that has been patched by me," he warned. "You might sail a distance in the boundless ocean, but it will sink one day. It's impossible to cross the great ocean in this way."</p>

  <p>Hallet's and Augustus' cultivation bases were at the consummation of True God Realm. With this, the great ocean beyond the Godly Ways was something they had to consider after becoming Holy Beings, so they didn't think too much about it in the present. It was already very lucky for them to get the Truth of Godly Way from their master.</p>

  <p>With the help of their makeshift Truth of Godly Way, they were basically invincible in the Arena of Legends. Barely anyone could match their strengths and power.</p>

  <p>The two of them grew very proud of their Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng had only been to the divine land for a few years.</p>

  <p>They were puzzled with his ability to know the new Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't answer their question. He shrugged and said with an awkward smile, "Well, let's just head out to the palace first, shall we?"</p>

  <p>Augustus climbed up from the pit, still embarrassed and infuriated. He paid attention to Hallet's expression and casually asked, "Why don't we spar again?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Hallet glared at him in annoyance,</p>

  <p>"That's enough!" He rolled his eyes, completely done with Augustus' attitude.</p>

  <p>After Hallet had snapped, Augustus decided to just keep quiet and obediently follow behind him.</p>

  <p>On their way into the fairy palace, Hallet asked Zheng why he stayed in the fairy palace instead of going to the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>Zheng, not wanting to make it a big deal, kept it short and explained what had happened after he entered the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"What! You're the anonymous guy everyone's talking about?!"</p>

  <p>Gus just listened, bewildered as Zheng told them about his consecutive wins in the Arena of Legends. His voice was as loud as thunderclaps, echoing in the square of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Hallet, with an angry look in his eyes, said, "Don't mind this idiot. Just continue."</p>

  <p>"After I received Harold's message, I decided to go and visit the Everest Spirit Mountain, but the Astronomical Transit Day came before that and I was invited by the Sun Blind race. In the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Rachelle and others..." Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>As he told them about the jade seal, Augustus proclaimed loudly once again, "You snatched that jade seal from Rachelle! What a good job!"</p>

  <p>It was obviously sarcastic, and Hallet couldn't stand Augustus anymore.</p>

  <p>He pointed to the direction of the weapon refining workshop where Livingston was doing a hard day's work.</p>

  <p>"What's that? An iron man? A puppet? Shit! What a weak puppet..."</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>As Augustus remained distracted, an invisible fish line shot from Hallet's fishing rod and tied up Augustus' legs. As he brandished the fishing rod lightly, Augustus circled into the air and was dropped into the pond nearby.</p>

  <p>Hallet let out a small chuckle and turned back to Zheng. "Go on with your story please."</p>

  <p>Looking over his shoulder, Zheng felt a little sorry for Augustus, but continued on with his story nonetheless.</p>

  <p>He explained to them how he had managed to escape.</p>

  <p>When he mentioned Estelle's use of the Scepter of Gods' Silence, Hallet stopped in his tracks. "So... it was because of you."</p>

  <p>Since the entire divine land had been silenced by the power of the scepter, no one had escaped the influence including Hallet and Augustus.</p>

  <p>After that, they realized the fact that Estelle had been released from the dungeon.</p>

  <p>"But, if I may ask, where did you learn the Truth of Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Hallet'd been waiting to ask that question since he saw Zheng use it the first time.</p>

  <p>He knew how difficult it was to get the Truth of Godly Way, so he was really curious as to how Zheng was able to get it.</p>

  <p>Even though many of the golden Sanskrit words had already been discovered, only a few of them were deciphered correctly, while only a handful were considered valuable.</p>

  <p>"I think I should be thanking my son for this," Zheng said with a proud smile.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Hallet's eyes grew wider and he was struck with confusion.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't say anything about it, he already knew that Zheng had moved his family here when he saw the several beautiful women residing in the fairy palace. Zheng had the right to do this, so no one really bothered him for doing so.</p>

  <p>But did the Truth of Godly Way have anything to do with Zheng's son?</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, Zheng led Hallet into the side hall. He pointed at the golden Sanskrit words hanging on the wall and said, "The Truth of Godly Way was deciphered by my son from the golden Sanskrit words left by our master," he explained. "I actually didn't know this until I returned to the fairy palace."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Hallet's jaw dropped and he let out a little gasp. His gaze fell on Geoffrey who was not too far away from them. "He is only 16 years old," Hallet processed. "How was he able to decipher the golden Sanskrit words?"</p>

  <p>Joy smiled softly. She had felt the same way earlier. She said, "Why not ask him to write a translation for you?"</p>

  <p>She neatly tucked away what Geoffrey translated for her, not wanting to share it with the rest.</p>

  <p>On the sidelines, Geoffrey grew quite curious about Hallet all along the way as he watched him riding his ox and throwing Augustus into the pond.</p>

  <p>His attention immediately perked up as he heard them speaking about him.</p>

  <p>"Kid, do you mind writing another translation of the golden Sanskrit words for me?" Hallet asked politely.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Geoffrey's face. He looked quite shy and hesitant, but he responded, "Of course I can. It's not that hard, but..." He stopped for a while and eventually smiled, "Is there any benefits for me to do that?"</p>
