<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Without uttering a single word, the Snake Spirit King wandered in the black cloud. Afterward, he launched another attack on Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng was already seriously injured. His body was covered in cuts.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's plan was to finish Zheng before he could fully recover.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Snake Spirit King activated the Probability Extreme Form, a thousand creatures that looked exactly like him appeared in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then, they all came together and charged towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A thousand identical versions of the Snake Spirit King brandished their black blades at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just a few moments ago, Zheng couldn't see the Snake Spirit King's movements. But now, he was able to see them clearly.</p>

  <p>There were nearly two thousand black blades hacking down at Zheng. But before the blows could land on him, he suddenly vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng reappeared on the edge of the black cloud.</p>

  <p>This time, he was not alone. There were nine hundred and ninety-nine duplicates of himself surrounding him.</p>

  <p>Adding the original, there were a thousand identical Zhengs. They stood in a circle on the edge of the black cloud.</p>

  <p>"So this is my limit? At most, I can only create nine hundred and ninety-nine versions of myself," Zheng muttered under his breath.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem like I can break through..." he whispered darkly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, me neither," the other nine hundred and ninety-nine duplicates replied in chorus.</p>

  <p>They sounded like bees buzzing in unison.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! Come and fight me!" the Snake Spirit King roared furiously.</p>

  <p>He was already getting impatient.</p>

  <p>He and the copies of himself dispersed simultaneously. Each of them was going to deal with a Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once again, the Snake Spirit King brandished and directed his black blades towards Zheng. The former's copies did the same and went for Zheng's copies.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had a different approach.</p>

  <p>Instead of fighting him head-on, Zheng came up with a sensible plan.</p>

  <p>Just like earlier, he disappeared again.</p>

  <p>One would be unable to predict the other's movement while they were inside this black cloud.</p>

  <p>Even though the Snake Spirit King had mastered the Probability Extreme Form, he still wouldn't be able to foresee Zheng's next move. As a result, he and his copies didn't hit their targets.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Zheng reappeared in the center of the black cloud together with his nine hundred and ninety-nine copies.</p>

  <p>The two of them exchanged blows back and forth once more as they activated the Probability Extreme Form at the same time.</p>

  <p>The people on the altar and the snake spirits below became even more confused.</p>

  <p>They couldn't see the Snake Spirit King a few seconds ago, but they could hear harsh metallic sounds echoing from the black cloud. This meant that the Snake Spirit King was still fighting Zheng.</p>

  <p>But now, there were no signs of Zheng and the Snake Spirit King fighting at all. They couldn't hear any sound. They soon realized that the fight between them was now beyond what they could ever imagine.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. Are they... Maybe they're fighting somewhere else?</p>

  <p>Maybe they're in a different dimension," surmised one of the people on the altar.</p>

  <p>"I can't even sense their auras anymore. This is so weird!"</p>

  <p>"It looks like Zheng has comprehended the same bodily movement skill as the Snake Spirit King. Don't worry. I think Zheng will win," Corbett hypothesized.</p>

  <p>The tension in the atmosphere gradually dissipated after Zheng and the Snake Spirit King disappeared.</p>

  <p>Just then, Alphonse and Hamilton climbed to the top of the altar and stood in front of Corbett.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Elder Corbett," said Alphonse.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you again, Elder Corbett..." Hamilton bowed respectfully as he said his greetings.</p>

  <p>Corbett was an old servant of Kincaid. Even so, he held a high status in the Human Spirit Sect. He was even allowed to take charge of the Human Spirit Sect on behalf of the Human Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The human spirits of the Joy House, the Broad House, and the Black House were all excited to see Corbett. However, they were trapped inside the space earlier. Therefore, they couldn't greet him.</p>

  <p>Corbett looked at the human spirits and sighed. "Are you the only ones left in this world?"</p>

  <p>"Aside from us, there are also two hundred world builders," Alphonse answered promptly.</p>

  <p>The world builders were responsible for creating secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't have high ranks in the Human Spirit Sect. Simply put, they were not core members of the sect.</p>

  <p>"Are there no other members of our sect left?" Corbett inquired once again.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, there are none," Alphonse replied.</p>

  <p>The human spirits of the Joy House, the Broad House, and the Black House stayed on the Other Shore for quite some time. Even though they worked for the Snake Spirit Sect, they still searched for their kind in secret. They found that they were the only ones who survived in the world.</p>

  <p>"Alas! That is quite regrettable." Corbett sighed again. He felt sorry for his own kind.</p>

  <p>Alphonse remained silent and thought for a while. Afterward, he asked,</p>

  <p>"Do you want to search for the elders of the Bold Conjecture House?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," Corbett responded without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Within the Human Spirit Sect, the Bold Conjecture House relished the same reputation as the Ten Directions House. As a matter of fact, it played a more important role in the Human Spirit Sect than the Ten Directions House.</p>

  <p>Every member of the Ten Directions House was the greatest among the entire Human Spirit Sect. For instance, the leader of the Ten Directions House was originally only slightly weaker than Kincaid. On the other hand, it was thanks to the Bold Conjecture House that the members of the Ten Directions House became such powerful.</p>

  <p>The strongest human spirits in terms of brute strength would join the Ten Directions House. However, the powerful and resourceful human spirits would definitely choose to join the Bold Conjecture House.</p>

  <p>When Kincaid was trapped, Corbett placed his hopes upon the Bold Conjecture House. He thought that the members of this house might be able to come up with some plan to free Kincaid.</p>

  <p>However, what happened was beyond his expectations.</p>

  <p>The young man who came to save Kincaid was not from the Bold Conjecture House or the Ten Directions House at all. In fact, he was not even a human spirit, but a human being. Corbett was absolutely astonished by this turn of event.</p>

  <p>"It is unfortunate, but we surmise that all the members of the Bold Conjecture House had all been killed," Alphonse informed.</p>

  <p>'We have been looking for them so many years. We haven't heard anything from them yet.</p>

  <p>If they were not truly gone, we should have found them already, '</p>

  <p>Alphonse thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"But now, there's finally hope. This human named Zheng is fighting with the Snake Spirit King. If Master Kincaid knew about it, he would be glad,"</p>

  <p>Corbett said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng hadn't defeated the Snake Spirit King yet, he had already saved the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"I really hope he wins against the Snake Spirit King," added Alphonse.</p>

  <p>This battle was far too important for them. Their fate rested upon Zheng's shoulders.</p>

  <p>After the Snake Spirit King and Zheng disappeared for two minutes, they suddenly heard a loud sound echoing throughout the entire area.</p>

  <p>"Are they battling again?" Hamilton asked while releasing his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Every one of the people on the altar shivered. They looked around and unleashed their spiritual sense. Soon enough, they saw two figures on the open field in front of the altar.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King slashed at Zheng with his two black blades.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng raised his heavy sword above his head to block the attack. "You have been the one delivering attacks for quite some time now. It's time for me to strike back," Zheng said tauntingly.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had completely healed his wounds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he thought it was his chance to fight back.</p>

  <p>He only uttered a few words before silence fell once more.</p>

  <p>He and the Snake Spirit King disappeared again.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, the sound of metal colliding echoed once more.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has fully recovered! That's good news!"</p>

  <p>"So now he's starting to retaliate?"</p>

  <p>"He had sustained severe injuries earlier. Yet, he still managed to avoid all of the Snake Spirit King's attacks until now! Zheng is incredible!"</p>

  <p>Everyone watching the fight from the altar were quite clever. There were no details that could escape them.</p>

  <p>The two of them were battling within the black cloud once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the Snake Spirit King kept delivering attacks, blocking them, or avoiding them. They never stopped moving.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, their spectators were unable to follow their actions.</p>

  <p>The group of Zheng's duplicates closed in on the group of the Snake Spirit King's copies.</p>

  <p>Each of Zheng's copies attacked its target with moves that differed from the others'.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, each of the Snake Spirit King's copies blocked the attacks and retaliated. It was like watching a well-choreographed dance.</p>

  <p>The two of them had fought ten thousand rounds in just about two seconds.</p>

  <p>"So, now you have comprehended the Probability Extreme Form as well.</p>

  <p>But what does it matter? At most, this fight will merely result in a draw.</p>

  <p>Just face it. You can't even hurt me at all." The Snake Spirit King finally spoke.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained calm and smiled. "Is the Probability Extreme Form all that mysterious person behind you taught you?"</p>

  <p>"What are you getting at?" The Snake Spirit King stared at Zheng and frowned.</p>

  <p>He didn't know why Zheng would say that. But he suddenly had a bad feeling about it.</p>

  <p>"Truly, the theurgies from the fifth-grade world are powerful and remarkable. Such a pity. The only thing you mastered is the Probability Extreme Form," Zheng replied as he gripped his sharp sword tightly.</p>

  <p>Once again, energy flowed out of the cracks on his sword.</p>
