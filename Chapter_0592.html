<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 592 Heavenly Fruit Tree (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After exerting so much energy to get here, Lennon never thought the blue treasure box would fly away before his yes.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't only the blue box that had suddenly vanished. All the crates, including the two golden treasure boxes and the black treasure box which were at the very top, were seen floating along the luminous beam at the same time.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on here?" Lennon muttered to himself. Already too exhausted, he had no energy to shout abuse.</p>

  <p>But strange things such as this happened also in other places.</p>

  <p>In the fourth stage of Cloud Road, which was called Thrilling Icy Plain, Frank killed three devil icy snowmen. By executing them, he was finally able to mount a new stage.</p>

  <p>To kill the three snowmen, he not only relied on his excellent skills but also made use of the three talismans, given by his father. These talismans were extremely valuable. Frank had been through several life and death situations, but he never brought out these amulets. This time, without hesitation, he took them out to conquer the three devil icy snowmen.</p>

  <p>He had no other choice. The rewards of the fourth stage were generous.</p>

  <p>He couldn't imagine how incredible the reward would be after he killed the three devil icy snowmen.</p>

  <p>When he walked up the steps made of ice blocks, he saw a steaming pool of blood.</p>

  <p>"A blood pool..." he whispered. He raised his head and looked at the wall. Frank read the words on the wall - 'flood dragon's blood', and those words appeared as flying dragons and dancing phoenixes.</p>

  <p>It was flood dragon's blood! Frank was amazed.</p>

  <p>While the flood dragon's blood wasn't a patch of a Genuine Dragon's blood, it would still greatly benefit the warrior if he soaked himself in it for some time.</p>

  <p>So Frank felt it was worthwhile for him to use the three talismans!</p>

  <p>He strode towards the blood pool in high spirits. However, before he could approach the pool, a strong beam of light shone over the blood pool. Then like the boxes, the blood pool appeared to travel along with the light until it vanished.</p>

  <p>"What just happened? How did it fly away like that?" a stupefied Frank asked. He wasn't the type of person to give up easily. Faced with the strange situation, he immediately used his spear to tap the ground then flew toward the pool. However, just as he touched the ray of light, Frank was thrown off instantly and bounced before rolling down the steps made of ice blocks.</p>

  <p>"Frank! What happened?" Lois screamed. She looked extremely worried as she rushed toward Frank and bent down to check him. Then she helped him get up.</p>

  <p>In Thrilling Icy Plain, only Frank among the five was able to catch up with the three devil icy snowmen, who were all quite strong. It wasn't easy defeating them. To terminate the enemies, Frank needed his best skills and the three talismans, and still, it nearly cost him his life. But when he was about to succeed in getting the reward, the blood pool suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>"What! What on earth is going on?" Frank bellowed. He shook off Lois' hands and stared with disappointment at the place where the blood pool once was. He was reluctant to accept the fact about its disappearance.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Patrick, and Lewis also stared up at the sky with puzzled looks.</p>

  <p>There wasn't only one ray of light in the sky. There were as many as seven or eight rays of light interlacing in the air. They were all stumped about what was happening on Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Besides Death Road, Sea of Raging Fire and Life Road, strange things similar to this also happened in all the other places. Even near the entrance of the Cloud Road, there were rays of light in its numerous roads.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Road was all abuzz because of those rays of light. It was impossible that Fernandez and the sect leaders didn't know about it.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is going on? Why do strange things like this happen on Cloud Road?" "I have to report it to our superior!" a shocked Fernandez said.</p>

  <p>Looking up at the rays of lights, Kenneth shook his head. He muttered,</p>

  <p>"Although Cloud Road is a broken world, its destruction will still take hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years. It should be in the stability phase now, so why are there irregularities? Is it because of the flood dragon?"</p>

  <p>The leader of the Auspice Sect spoke up, "It will make no sense to inform the superior. Our leader is practicing in a secluded place now."</p>

  <p>A worried Lady Long looked at the group. She said, "But how about the disciples on Cloud Road? If they were killed by the rays of light, what should we do? Their lives are of great importance!"</p>

  <p>Every three years, disciples who passed the Cloud Road's exams could enter Cloud Hall, which meant they automatically became the elite disciples of Cloud Hall. Once they were part of Cloud Hall, they would receive excellent training and education. If all these elite disciples died at this time, it would be a huge loss for Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"We could only wait and see. I'm hoping that this isn't a bad omen!"</p>

  <p>While Fernandez observed the rays of light at random through the Picture Slab, his face turned ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who stood on the square, then realized why Tia had asked him to stand near the stone terrace.</p>

  <p>And he now also understood why there was one light spot after another on the square!</p>

  <p>These very light spots were what drew the treasured objects and treasure boxes on the Cloud Road through the light beams.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they heard loud crashing sounds.</p>

  <p>Several treasure boxes pounded heavily on the square.</p>

  <p>"The boxes!" Zheng cried out. His eyes widened in shock at the sight of them. Those red treasure boxes appeared before his eyes were precisely the ones hidden in the secret test! It would cost much to get any one of these boxes. But now, they had been put casually on the square.</p>

  <p>Again, the crashing sound jolted Zheng.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could react, six or seven blue boxes, three silver boxes, two golden boxes, and one black box came into view. He was too stunned over what he saw.</p>
