  <p>
</p>

  <p>Esther shot Luo Zheng a meaningful look.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's mysterious ways, he didn't even need the help of the Demon Night; the ogres wouldn't be able to do anything to him.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Esther couldn't help thinking about how fortunate it was that Luo Zheng was close to Xun. It was precisely because of this that the Demon Night didn't have any enmity with him.</p>

  <p>But even if the Demon Night and the ogres joined forces, they wouldn't be able to go up against Luo Zheng in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Esther's gaze finally stopped on Maurice as she said coldly, "Maurice, do you still want to kill Luo Zheng now?"</p>

  <p>Maurice's eyes twitched as he pulled a long face. After a long while, he spat out, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Without the two war sages, the ogres didn't have any advantage over the Demon Night. Furthermore, there was also Luo Zheng to deal with. Since even the war sages hadn't been able to defeat him, there was no point in the top-level war lords fighting against him.</p>

  <p>The ogre war lords turned around and prepared to leave with Maurice.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Malcom was staring intently at Luo Zheng. Luo Zheng was a mere level ten war fighter, and Malcom had thought that he could kill him effortlessly.</p>

  <p>However, he had just seen Luo Zheng get rid of the two ogre war sages. If they didn't kill Luo Zheng while he was still young, he would become a huge threat to the ogres in the future.</p>

  <p>But how could they kill him?</p>

  <p>No one could give Malcom an answer. He had interpreted the smile on Zheng's face as an indication that he was trying his best to remain calm. But now he realized that Luo Zheng was smiling because he was confident of himself.</p>

  <p>In the end, Malcom could only grit his teeth and follow Maurice.</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors had enough foresight to understand that the situation in the Tower of Sin was going to change. It was likely that the 128 seats on the top floor of the tower would be reshuffled.</p>

  <p>The ogres' bodies were as large as mountains. After they left, the tenth floor seemed somewhat empty.</p>

  <p>Only then did Esther ask, "Luo Zheng, how did you do it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had thrown the two war sages out of the Tower of Sin without so much as lifting a finger, and the war sages hadn't even had the strength to fight back. Esther couldn't figure it out.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask," Xun said flatly.</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's words, Esther immediately nodded. "Yes, Queen."</p>

  <p>Everyone had their own secrets. Esther was curious about the truth, but since Xun didn't want her to ask, she wasn't going to continue probing into it.</p>

  <p>After the ogre war lords left, Esther ordered the war lords of the Demon Night to leave as well. It was then that the war generals on the tenth floor began to whisper among themselves.</p>

  <p>Xun turned to Luo Zheng. "Let's make a trip to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. I have something very important to do."</p>

  <p>"Can it wait? Let's go after I completely refine the Lucky Light," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>Xun raised her gaze and looked at Yolande, who was in the audience.</p>

  <p>Yolande had been observing the entire arena from start to finish in silence, without the slightest change in expression. Now that their eyes met, there was a change in both Xun's and Yolande's expressions.</p>

  <p>Xun walked toward Yolande.</p>

  <p>"I know you," she said indifferently.</p>

  <p>A formless Mu Ning emanated from Xun's body at all times. This Mu Ning did not originate from her soul but from the queen's Mu Ning that had been nurtured over the countless years she had been in power.</p>

  <p>Facing such an imposing Mu Ning, any weaker being that stood in front of Xun wouldn't be able to help but kneel. However, Yolande didn't seem to be affected by her Mu Ning in the slightest. "I know you too," she said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll succeed," Xun said. Her words sounded strange.</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked her eyes. "If I can succeed, I'll help you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Xun nodded, unexpectedly giving her a smile.</p>

  <p>The conversation between the two was completely baffling. However, Luo Zheng, who was standing beside them, was able to catch some clues from it.</p>

  <p>According to what Phoebe had said, the queens of the Demon Night were not from this world but from the Upper World. Xun was the queen of all the Demon Night members.</p>

  <p>Since Xun and Yolande knew each other, it meant that Yolande was from the Upper World as well. The two of them must have known each other from the time they were in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>But why was there a Yolande in the Central Region and another Yolande on the Sea God Continent? It seemed that Luo Zheng would have to find an opportunity to ask Xun this question.</p>

  <p>After talking to Yolande, Xun turned to Esther and said, "After Luo Zheng refines the Lucky Light, we'll go to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Queen!" Esther, Madeline, and Elder Mei said in unison, giving Xun a salute.</p>

  <p>Xun transformed into red dots of light and disappeared into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng retrieved his sword, he walked toward Olivia.</p>

  <p>A warm smile appeared on Olivia's face before he even got close, as if she was watching the triumphant arrival of the hero.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Luo Zheng said to Fabian and Jarrod.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the appearance of Fabian and Jarrod, the two human seat owners, hadn't changed the situation in the slightest. However, the humans had stood up at the most critical moment and tried to protect Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>That was why Luo Zheng wanted to thank them and offer them his help.</p>

  <p>If they hadn't stood up for him when he was in danger and just treated him as a compatriot that they could gain benefits from, then Luo Zheng wouldn't offer them his help even though they were fellow humans.</p>

  <p>"We were just doing the right thing. We're all human beings, after all,"</p>

  <p>Jarrod said. "Unfortunately, we are too weak to fight against the ogres. Even if we want to fight them, we are powerless."</p>

  <p>"You're not to blame for that. I'll always remember that you stood up for me when I was in danger," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had been killed, the Demon Night wouldn't have encountered too much trouble, but the humans would have. They would have definitely faced the ogres' revenge. The humans in the Tower of Sin would have suffered, and even the Purple Heart Sacred Place would have been affected.</p>

  <p>The ogres would have taken the opportunity to completely wipe out the humans' sacred place. For the two ogres' sacred places, this wasn't a difficult matter. As long as they could deal with the elders at the Soul Sea Realm in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, it would be enough.</p>

  <p>"I'll go to the Purple Heart Sacred Place, but before that, I have to go to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. Just wait for me," Luo Zheng promised with a smile.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod smiled back at Luo Zheng in gratitude. It was unprecedented for war lords to be so grateful toward a war fighter.</p>

  <p>The two of them clearly understood the meaning behind Zheng's words. Since he had already achieved this much, he would be bringing the human race along with him as he rose to power. Although only two ogre war sages had died today, they believed that in the near future, the entire Tower of Sin would be reshuffled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and left, heading to the living area. He wanted to rent a training room to refine the Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>Looking at his retreating figure, Olivia wanted to say something, but decided otherwise.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng sat quietly in the secret chamber, a smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He suddenly realized how crowded his body was. Not only were there nine Genuine Dragons lurking in his mind, but there was also a huge furnace with an unknown origin. The sword spirit in his body was actually one of the queens of the Demon Night and she still had her own consciousness.</p>
