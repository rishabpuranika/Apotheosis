<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The other three divine kingdoms had always tolerated the York Divine Kingdom because of the secret sect and the little monster. But on the whole, the four great divine kingdoms had been harmonious with each other all these years as they were under the control of the humans of the Upper World. The whole Divine Kingdom Continent seemed like a joint force.</p>

  <p>Now War King Wind lost his temper because he could no longer stand Lucien's behavior. Of course, it was also because of Fiona. He had figured out that she was actually very concerned about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This time he must be really angry. He means serious business!"</p>

  <p>"This is the second time. It's been a long time since the four divine kingdoms had a conflict..."</p>

  <p>"Will War Emperor York take action?"</p>

  <p>A wave of heat spread out around War King Wind; it looked like he was about to attack.</p>

  <p>"Lucien, since you can't control the Black Star, you should give it back to Luo Zheng," suggested Turner calmly.</p>

  <p>Scott also took a step forward and stood beside Turner. This time, nobody seemed to be standing on War Emperor York's side.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York was outraged but he didn't return the Black Star to Luo Zheng. Instead, his figure flashed as he charged straight towards the pyramid.</p>

  <p>He was unwilling to accept defeat.</p>

  <p>Even if he couldn't control the Black Star, he had to try it out. After all, it was a supreme divine weapon. The pickax might be much stronger than a normal sacred weapon or divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Seeing War Emperor York dashing towards the 45th layer, the three divine kingdom rulers just sighed. War King Wind said, "Forget it. If he's willing to give it a try, then let him."</p>

  <p>War Emperor York entered through the narrow door on the 45th layer and fell onto a leaf.</p>

  <p>There was a purple mineral-devouring bug resting on the leaf. When it noticed War Emperor York, it made two short creaking sounds and flapped its wings in preparation to pounce on him.</p>

  <p>Even before the bug could approach War Emperor York, he struck out a fist. An invisible wave of the emperor's powerful energy blew the purple mineral-devouring bug away.</p>

  <p>In the past, War Emperor York would be interested in capturing this bug.</p>

  <p>However, now that he had the Black Star, he couldn't be bothered.</p>

  <p>After chasing the purple mineral-devouring bug away, he took two steps forward and raised the Black Star in his hand. He brought the pickax down ruthlessly as his eyes gleamed with determination!</p>

  <p>Smash!</p>

  <p>Waves surged in the Soul Sea within his body. The power that his life vitality stimulated erupted in an instant!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>As he smashed the Black Star down on the leaf, the entire tree shook with the tremendous force.</p>

  <p>That blue leaf remained smooth as a mirror, without the slightest of cracks...</p>

  <p>"Thwack!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Thump!"</p>

  <p>"Thud..."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>War Emperor York hit the leaf a dozen times with the Black Star. His palm cracked open and blood flowed from it towards the Black Star.</p>

  <p>However, the blood bounced off the Black Star which had accepted Luo Zheng as its master. Now this pickax would not accept War Emperor York's blood.</p>

  <p>What was more, there was a Law of Causality on the leaf of the 45th layer too.</p>

  <p>This Law of Causality was for absolute defense!</p>

  <p>One couldn't break it by brute force alone. So War Emperor York failed not because he was lacking in strength, but because of the limitation of the rules!</p>

  <p>The Black Star contained the Law of Causality that it could break anything. Most importantly, its Law of Causality was more powerful than the one contained in the leaf. If the two Laws of Causality were to compete against each other, the pickax would surely win!</p>

  <p>However, War Emperor York wasn't able to control the Black Star nor was he able to activate the Law of Causality in the pickax.</p>

  <p>He was deeply disappointed but also hesitant to return the Black Star to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth and sighed internally. "Forget it. This thing is not something I need in my life."</p>

  <p>He then jumped off the leaf, falling into the circle of light. Soon, his figure appeared on the side of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>Turner and War King Wind looked at each other and smiled knowingly when they saw the expression on the poor War Emperor York's face.</p>

  <p>With the Black Star in his hand, War Emperor York flew towards them and sneered at Luo Zheng. He waved his right hand slightly and the Black Star flew straight towards Luo Zheng with a sharp whistle. It was obvious that it was carrying an extremely strong force with it.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, be careful!" Fiona called out hastily as she saw the Black Star flying towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed, and suddenly his body was filled with the power of three thousand dragon scales! There was a nonchalant smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He easily caught the Black Star with just two fingers.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the Soul Sea Realm masters were surprised. They stood there dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Everyone could clearly see the enormous force of the Black Star when War Emperor York released it. Despite being highly-skilled warriors, they would have to go all out in order to receive this mighty pickax.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had done it effortlessly! He only used two fingers to catch this impressive tool. 'He must be incredibly strong!' everyone thought.</p>

  <p>With the Black Star in his hand, Luo Zheng smiled and focused on climbing to the top layers of the pyramid.</p>

  <p id="top_6">When the Soul Sea Realm masters saw Luo Zheng entering the pyramid, they, too, flew towards it and followed him in through the narrow gates.</p>

  <p>Divine-level talents like Callan, Fiona, Randy and Camilla also followed him. Although there were purple mineral-devouring bugs on the top layers, they might not pose a major threat to the divine-level talents as there were many powerful Soul Sea Realm masters in the tree to protect them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not enter the top layer, but instead went straight to the 45th layer.</p>

  <p>The first ore he needed to obtain was the life crystal on that layer as it contained life energy. He only needed to get one life crystal to save Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to step onto the 45th layer, many of the Soul Sea Realm masters also entered. They stood on the leaves of the 45th layer, the 46th one as well as the top layer.</p>

  <p>The amount of ores in the leaves of the 45th, 46th and 47th layers was not big, but all of them were rare and precious. Almost every ore could be used to create semi-divine weapons or even divine weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took two steps forward on the wide leaf and located the life crystal!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had spent a lot of time and effort finding this life crystal. Finally, he had found it and he also had the Black Star with him. A hint of excitement appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng needed the life stones from the start and he intends to dig for the life crystal now. It seems like this item is really important to him..."</p>

  <p>"Is his family member's lifespan coming to an end? Does he need the life crystal to sustain his or her life?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea. He is not a member of the four divine kingdoms after all."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the Black Star can really penetrate that leaf..."</p>

  <p>"I, too, have some doubts. Although the Black Star is known to be a supreme divine weapon, no one has ever seen its true power!"</p>

  <p>The powerful Soul Sea Realm masters were discussing all this among themselves on the leaves, with anticipation in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Basically, the top three layers of the mine tree were like three transparent treasure boxes! However, they hadn't been able to obtain the key to the treasure boxes for so many years. Now that the key had fallen into Zheng's hands, everyone hoped that he would be able to open the boxes.</p>

  <p>"This time, I'll definitely succeed!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed in excitement, and he lightly struck the blue leaf with the pickax in his hand.</p>

  <p>He did not employ much power, but as he brandished his pickax, a mysterious force spread out! This was the power of the Law of Causality!</p>

  <p>"Ding..."</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters held their collective breaths.</p>

  <p>The power was extremely simple but superior. The Soul Sea Realm masters could tell that they would never be able to fight it! The pickax seemed to be able to penetrate through everything.</p>

  <p>The moment the Black Star struck the leaf, an invisible force field around the leaf cracked! This was the leaf's Law of Causality of absolute defense!</p>

  <p>When the two Laws of Causality were pitted against each other, the Black Star's Law of Causality had the absolute advantage!</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Luo Zheng barely tapped the leaf, it began to shatter layer by layer...</p>
