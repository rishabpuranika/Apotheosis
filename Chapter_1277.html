<br/><br/>

  

  <p>This was really depressing. The two stages of the True Path hadn't been easy, and now, when he had finally entered the library, how could he return empty-handed?</p>

  <p>Zheng leaped forward and jumped onto a bookshelf in the first row.</p>

  <p>The covers of every single book on this shelf were made of some kind of metal. They were extremely cold and tough, and the books themselves were enormously heavy. Although Zheng couldn't identify the materials of the pages inside, he was sure that they were more than strong enough to be used in weapon refining.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the side of a huge book and exerted all the strength he had in his body. However, the book did not even budge a single inch.</p>

  <p>"Is this book that heavy?" Zheng exclaimed, as his expression suddenly changed. This was an impossibility.</p>

  <p>When his power exploded out, it was enough to tear apart mountains and the earth itself. However, he hadn't expected the book to be this heavy.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already been proud of his strength, but now he couldn't even lift a book. A look of unwillingness and irritation appeared on his face. This time, the force of the dragon scales within his body suddenly erupted out, and he used every ounce of his strength to grab onto a corner of the book. Finally, he managed to pull it off the bookshelf.</p>

  <p>The three women were still looking up when they suddenly saw a book that was as big as a house crashing down towards them. Their faces also revealed astonishment.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng's expression changed drastically as he roared,</p>

  <p>"Dodge it quickly! Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>The weight of the book was unknown, but Zheng reckoned that it was no lighter than a mountain range. It was almost equivalent to the combined weight of 23 mountains, and if the three women were to be hit by it, even Yudie would not be able to survive such an onslaught. Margaret and Aura were even weaker than her so they had to get out of the way.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Yudie's reactions were extremely fast. She gently reached out her hands, grabbed both Margaret and Aura and retreated quickly to a side.</p>

  <p>The moment the three women got clear of the zone, the huge book directly fell on the spot where they had been standing.</p>

  <p>It was unknown what material was used to make the floor. But what was astonishing was that even when such a heavy book smashed down on it, not even a crack appeared. It was as though an ordinary book had been thrown to the floor.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know just how many years it had been since this fairy palace had come into existence. If it was built using ordinary stones, how could it have withstood the endless years of erosion? It would have already turned into ashes if that were the case. Any sort of material that could withstand the corrosion of time was no ordinary thing.</p>

  <p>Zheng leaped down and turned towards the women with a helpless smile and an apologetic look on his face.</p>

  <p>Yudie glared at Zheng, clearly blaming him for his reckless actions.</p>

  <p>However, to be honest, Zheng already knew that Yudie was capable of saving the other two women. Otherwise, he would have used the Time Law to save the three of them.</p>

  <p>After taking the book off the shelf, Zheng walked towards the edge of the enormous book and flipped its cover open. It was no mean task.</p>

  <p>Though it was only a cover, yet it weighed as much as a mountain.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng flipped open the large book, he saw that rows upon rows of faint golden words were beginning to appear on the first page.</p>

  <p>When Zheng initially saw these words, his eyes lit up. Each of these words were giving out an invisible pressure. They looked like twisted runes painted by some newcomer, but he understood that these runes were not divine textures, but something else entirely.</p>

  <p>After he stared at the large book for a while, a helpless smile appeared on his face. "I don't understand these words."</p>

  <p>The three women had surrounded Zheng and the book. If even with Zheng's experience, he couldn't understand the words that had sprung up, how could they hope to do so?</p>

  <p>It hadn't been easy for him to obtain the token of water, but now, he was unable to read a single word in here. Thus, Zheng was somewhat dejected.</p>

  <p>However, after some thought, he felt that it was normal.</p>

  <p>After all, with the development of civilization, numerous different cultures had evolved, and almost every civilization had come up with their own language. In fact, Zheng was sure that these words were from some language he hadn't even heard of. And that was okay. No matter how powerful a warrior was, he wouldn't be able to understand every single language.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, a large book that was lying alone on another shelf opened up by itself. Smoke rose up from inside it, and from within the smoke, an amiable old man slowly appeared.</p>

  <p>After collecting his wits, the man started to walk in Zheng's direction. As he walked, the smoke dissipated, giving the people beholding the old man's presence the feeling of a transcendent being, as if he was riding on clouds. The old man looked like an immortal to Zheng and the three women.</p>

  <p>"Young man, you shouldn't have opened the book. I can see that you don't even know any of the words," the old man reprimanded, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was filled with curiosity as he asked, "Was the method I used wrong?"</p>

  <p>The old man nodded before saying, "Close the book. Let me teach you how to really open it."</p>

  <p>Since he wanted to learn its secrets, Zheng followed his instructions and closed the book. He then asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>By that time, Saul had already rushed over. Upon hearing Zheng's words, he answered for the old man, "You can just call him Immortal Book. He is responsible for managing this library." After he finished speaking, Saul smiled and said to the old man, "Hey there. It's been so many years since we last met."</p>

  <p>Immortal Book glanced at Saul, and snorted, as if he was extremely dissatisfied with the latter. "That's because it's been so many years since the library itself was opened. Master entrusted the fairy palace to you, yet you seem so irresponsible."</p>

  <p>Saul had a helpless look on his face. It was not that he had not wanted to open the library; it was just that the previous owners of the fairy palace had sucked. The second owner was someone who had disappeared even before activating the True Path. As for the third one, which was Immortal Mist himself, although he had activated the True Path and obtained the token of thunder, he hadn't even passed through the first stage of the True Path.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book seemed to be too lazy to argue with Saul. He was responsible for the library, and he would serve those who entered the library. He walked up to Zheng and told him in a friendly manner, "Wealth and beauty can be gained through diligent study. In this library, each book has its own universe. Take a look!"</p>

  <p>Then, he pointed a finger at the book, and a golden pattern, spiral in shape and endless in beauty, appeared on the cover of the book. The old man now said slowly, "Inject your perception into it, and you will be able to read this book. It is called the Chaotic Storm Chronicle, and it recorded what our master experienced when he traveled in endless chaos.</p>

  <p>You might learn quite a lot of things in here."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng did as Immortal Book had said and poured his perception into the golden pattern. The moment he did that, a huge ball of light suddenly appeared inside his mind, as if what was inside the book was now taking place in his mind. As the light slowly dissipated, everything in his surroundings started to float rapidly. A completely strange world appeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>Standing in the air, Zheng looked around with his eyes filled with shock.</p>

  <p>"Is this the world recorded in the Chaotic Storm Chronicle?"</p>

  <p>The world in this book was in complete chaos. It was difficult for Zheng to even describe the kind of space he was looking at. It was not an absolute darkness, since there were faint rays of light coming in from the surroundings. However, it was enveloped by layers of grey mist, and everywhere was diffused a black-and-white colored fog. Zheng had seen this kind of fog before on the True Path— it was formed by the Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>Boom! A massive bolt of lightning struck through the chaos out of nowhere. "I can't comprehend the Law Power that is contained within this lightning!" Zheng cried.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Law within the lightning was in a perfect and complete state, and Zheng was unable to comprehend it. Compared to this bolt of lightning, the lightning that Zheng had seen before somehow seemed incomplete. This was not a simple comparison in terms of power, but a comparison in terms of perfection. Although Zheng could not see which layer of Thunder Law this lightning contained, he estimated that it was very likely to be the tenth layer.</p>

  <p>Zheng's line of sight was shuttling back and forth through the chaotic world at an extremely high speed. In fact, he was unable to control his own perception, as if he was following the movements of the owner of this book. It was like watching a picture with real time effects. Zheng could see everything but only as a passive spectator, accepting the breathtaking scenes recorded in the book.</p>

  <p>A long while later, Zheng finally exited the chaotic world of the book with a look of shock on his face.</p>

  <p>If what he guessed was right, then the chaos he had just seen was outside the universe itself. But what existence lay outside the universe? What did those bizarre scenes represent?</p>

  <p>Zheng had not found the answers to those questions in this book. The owner of this book had traveled an unknown distance in the chaos, but beyond that chaos was chaos still. It was as if the chaos was endless.</p>
