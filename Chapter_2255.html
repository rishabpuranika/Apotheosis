<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2255 Joy's Deduction (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>But I know what kind of person he is. He's the type of man who will never give up, not until his death stops him. That said, it's safe to say that he's almost dead now, but he has yet to give up. Alas, I do see a shimmer of new hope," she said with her lips curled upward.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her speak, Luo Luo Zheng was in no way relieved. Warriors like Joy were far too smart, and Luo Luo Zheng couldn't quite figure out exactly what was on her mind.</p>

  <p>For this reason, Luo Luo Zheng tentatively asked, "You said you saw new hope. Did you mean me?"</p>

  <p>With a shrug of her shoulders, Joy didn't admit it, nor did she deny it.</p>

  <p>She just continued staring intently at Luo Luo Zheng, looking him up and down.</p>

  <p>There was still a strange feeling coming from her eyes, as if she had been reluctant to let Luo Luo Zheng leave, or as if she wanted to say something more.</p>

  <p>This kind of feeling was confusing, and Luo Luo Zheng couldn't figure out what this Demi-holy Being meant.</p>

  <p>The two stared at each other for a short while, although it felt like a few hours. A voice coming from outside the palace disturbed them. "Master Joy, Princess Aleyna wants to see you."</p>

  <p>The Han Clan's Holy Emperor only had two daughters. Both of them were born in recent decades. The elder princess was Han Liusu, and the younger princess was Aleyna.</p>

  <p>Joy cast a reproachful glance at Luo Luo Zheng. "I don't know how much talent you've inherited from your father, but in terms of attracting girls, the apple didn't fall far from the tree. You're just like him."</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Han Liusu had a good relationship with each other. They should have come here and visited Luo Luo Zheng together. However, they were visiting in turns, and Joy could only come to the conclusion that there had been a misunderstanding between the sisters, that they weren't as close with one another as they had been in the past. And that misunderstanding might have something to do with this young man who called himself Tianxing.</p>

  <p>Joy remembered that it was almost the same time for Aleyna and Han Liusu to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Aleyna should have gotten to know Luo Luo Zheng in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, too.</p>

  <p>The only reason she came here alone must be that she had developed a girlish crush on Luo Luo Zheng, just like her sister had. 'I wonder what the Holy Emperor will think if he finds out both his daughters have fallen in love with the same guy!' Joy thought to herself.</p>

  <p>With a slight pout, Luo Luo Zheng said nothing. A girl in a blue dress, who had been standing for a while now at the palace gate, suddenly ran into the hall.</p>

  <p>Her smart eyes twinkled. Upon noticing Joy, Aleyna greeted her with a casual nod and then jumped toward Luo Luo Zheng. "Hi, Z...um...Tianxing!"</p>

  <p>She stuck her tongue out and clamped it between her front teeth. Luo Zheng's real name had nearly slipped out of her mouth due to her carelessness.</p>

  <p>"I'm so curious about your real name," Joy said, her tone now strange.</p>

  <p>Aleyna blushed. She touched her face with her hand in embarrassment and cast an apologetic glance at Luo Luo Zheng. She feigned innocence and murmured, "Real name? What do you mean? His name is Tianxing Luo and you know that!" Of course, she couldn't expect that her cover would only make Joy more suspicious.</p>

  <p>Joy, on her behalf, wouldn't expose what she knew in front of Aleyna.</p>

  <p>Instead, she just nodded her head in order to demonstrate her agreement.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, thank you so much for helping Kelsey and me a few days ago!</p>

  <p>Someday soon, I will thank you by inviting you over to my place."</p>

  <p>Aleyna was much bolder in character than Han Liusu. While speaking, she winked at Luo Luo Zheng secretly, indicating that she had a lot to talk to him about.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng remained expressionless. He was still feeling disturbed by what Joy had said earlier and was in no mood to fool around with this girl.</p>

  <p>Aleyna, however, was unable to grasp Luo Zheng's thoughts from the expression on his face. She shook Joy's hand and acted like a spoiled child. "I have something to tell Tianxing. Aunt Joy, would you please leave us alone for a while?"</p>

  <p>No more than four people in all the Han Clan would ever dare to speak to Joy in such a way.</p>

  <p>Joy spoiled and doted on both the Holy Emperor's daughters very much, but this time, she refused her. "Tianxing has something else to do. I'm afraid he doesn't have time for you today!"</p>

  <p>Disappointment etched itself onto Aleyna's features at Joy's words, but she quickly adjusted it. After all, Luo Luo Zheng was now here, on the Han Clan's Floating Island. There would be plenty of chances for her to meet him in the near future. With a smile now, she looked at Luo Luo Zheng again and said, "By the way, I have something for you, to say thanks!"</p>

  <p>And at that, she clapped her hands together briskly.</p>

  <p>Like magic, she pulled a huge table out of her Sumeru Space. As she waved her hand a second time, cups and bowls wondrously appeared atop the table. All kinds of precious dishes spread out, a few of which Joy herself had never even seen.</p>

  <p>Once Aleyna left, Joy fixed her eyes upon all the dishes splayed out the table and said with a smirk, "That little girl is just so thoughtful! You know, some of these dishes are very precious. Collecting them is quite the task."</p>

  <p>Before she could finish her sentence, a voice from the gate rang into their ears. "Master Joy, the clan head's daughter, Kelsey Han, has requested to meet with you."</p>

  <p>As she took in what she just heard, the corners of Joy's mouth twitched in surprise before pulling into a tight line. Did this girl come here to meet Tianxing, too?</p>

  <p>    </p>
