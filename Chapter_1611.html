<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The air was scorching hot as the two Lava Giants clashed with each other in close combat, competing for the flame kitten.</p>

  <p>It was a contest of pure strength, and the two Lava Giants displayed their shockingly powerful attacks to the maximum.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>One Lava Giant forcefully punched the other one's chest!</p>

  <p>The impact of the collision was immensely palpable that all of them felt dizzy. Everyone looked like small bugs that clung tightly on top of the Lava Giant's head.</p>

  <p>Coleman tightly grasped onto a crack in a stone. Even if the power of the flames within the stone was burning hot and unbearable, he couldn't help but want to squeeze his whole body inside it. For him, it was a better fate than to be thrown into the lava lake.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Jeffrey and Hailey each held on to a stone pillar for dear life, as if it was the last life-saving thing in the world.</p>

  <p>As for Janet, she held the slender Lofty Wood in one hand. Since she didn't want the flame kitten to be involved in the brawl, she could only use one hand to hold on to something to prevent herself from falling.</p>

  <p>However, the unexpectedly strong impact from the collision made her lose her balance. She lost her grasp and fell backward!</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>Janet's eyes were full of fear, but her other hand still held tightly on the Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey, Hailey, and the rest of them were all panicked at the scene!</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, Zheng slid along the Lava Giant's head as his body quickly maneuvered to grab Janet's arm, and delivered a downward punch at the same time!</p>

  <p>He made sure to deliver a punch with the power of 20, 000 dragon scales!</p>

  <p>He then fixed his fist directly on top of the Lava Giant's head, to lock himself in place while his other hand grasped Janet by her arm.</p>

  <p>Of course, his punch didn't damage the Lava Giant since it was so huge, that Zheng's attack felt like a mere mosquito bite to it.</p>

  <p>"That was so close!" Janet sighed as her chest heaved up and down in heavy breathing, still in shock. She had her one hand grabbed by Zheng, but she still lifted the Frosty Cage high up with the other hand. She didn't want the little flame kitten to die because of her…</p>

  <p>"But the situation doesn't seem to look good," Zheng said as he lay flat on the top of the Lava Giant's head while he watched the fierce battle between the two enormous beings.</p>

  <p>While he was indeed pleased earlier when he thought he had a brilliant idea to help all of them pass through the lava lake, he didn't expect the flame kitten to attract another Lava Giant…</p>

  <p>In the two Lava Giants' fight, those who suffered the most were probably Zheng and the others in the group. It was truly a disaster to all.</p>

  <p>They were still too insignificant for this fight now, that they could only hope that the Lava Giant beneath their feet wouldn't be defeated.</p>

  <p>If the Lava Giant did lose and fall into the lava lake, Zheng and the rest of them would be completely killed!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>More thunderous bumping and clashing sounds echoed in the vast cave as the fight continued.</p>

  <p>Although the fourth Hall of Causality was huge, it wasn't big enough to hold a spacious cave as such. Then again, it was built against a mountain so it was likely that they had already been inside the mountain, or it was just an extension of the space. Ever since the Hall of Causality was constructed and as long as it was strong enough, the heavens had always decided how it was to be built.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the other Lava Giant punched the Lava Giant beneath Zheng squarely on the face!</p>

  <p>The violent tremors caused the Lava Giant to stagger backwards, while the people on top of its head felt like they were on a boat that continuously swayed back and forth.</p>

  <p>The attack had also caused a raging wave in the lava lake. Flames erupted from the surging lava and spread out in all directions!</p>

  <p>"Don't fall! Don't fall! Don't fall down, please..." Coleman almost cried as he prayed.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant was already tilting backwards at sixty degrees.</p>

  <p>Once it fell down, everyone would fall into the lava!</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom, boom…"</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant staggered a few steps before it finally started to fall.</p>

  <p>Everyone was in panic. They saw the lava rapidly approach them, or it was because the Lava Giant was falling backwards quite fast!</p>

  <p>Ten thousand feet…</p>

  <p>Five thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Three thousand feet…</p>

  <p>One thousand feet…</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet…</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the Lava Giant's head was about to sink as well. Everyone looked positively despaired.</p>

  <p>If they were really going to sink, all of their journeys to the Hall of Causality would come to an end.</p>

  <p>Even if all of them had already earned more than five million Illusion Points, they would only lose more if they were to die now. A few more seconds later, they were only one hundred feet away from the lava.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant's whole body was almost covered entirely with lava.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Lava Giant used both of its hands to hold itself in the Lava Lake, stopping its fall. Although its body was already sunken in the lava lake, its head was still above the lava!</p>

  <p>Jeffrey and the others wiped the sweat off their foreheads. They had escaped this calamity.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant hoisted itself up with both arms, stood up, and started to attack the Lava Giant on the other side.</p>

  <p>However, something unfortunate had happened.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others all wanted to curse out of frustration.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Lava Giant beneath their feet was using its head to smash its opponent!</p>

  <p>They would've normally praised it for being smart enough to do such an attack, but they all clung onto its head right now. If the Lava Giant smashed its head against its opponent, there would probably be nothing left of them at the end of the fight!</p>

  <p>"Quick! Leave the top of this fellow's head!"</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled out his fist from the Lava Giant's head, stomped on a stone pillar, and rushed upwards. He still held Janet in one hand. He couldn't abandon her since she still had to control the Lofty Wood, after all.</p>

  <p>Everyone quickly retreated. They climbed from the head of the Lava Giant down to the backside of its head. For the time being, this place was safe.</p>

  <p>But since the Lava Giant was using its head, there would probably be another huge tremor soon. After all of them had rushed to the backside of the Lava Giant's head, they started to look for safer spaces to settle down.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Apparently, it was a wise choice for the Lava Giant to use its head to attack!</p>

  <p>It was because the Lava Giant on the other side fell directly into the lava lake after it got hit.</p>

  <p>"That was close!" the normally quiet Hailey couldn't help but sigh. The rest of them felt the same way as well.</p>

  <p>Everyone had put their lives on the line when they stayed on the Lava Giant's head. If they weren't careful, they might really end up dead like crushed bugs.</p>

  <p>Now that the Lava Giant had defeated its opponent, Zheng immediately brought Janet back to the top of the Lava Giant's head. She once again threw out the impossibly long piece of Lofty Wood and started to swing it back and forth in front of the Lava Giant!</p>

  <p>"Meow…"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the little flame kitten still looked innocent as ever. It had no idea what had happened.</p>

  <p>After the Lava Giant saw the little flame kitten, it returned to the planned path as expected. It continued to chase after the tiny creature and once again, carried the group across the lava lake.</p>

  <p>This time, Janet had learned the lesson. She tried to hide it as much as possible as she controlled the Lofty Wood. She had to do it secretly to prevent attracting the other Lava Giants on the side of the lava lake.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to escape if more Lava Giants came!</p>

  <p>Not long after…</p>

  <p>Everyone finally saw the other side of the lava lake.</p>

  <p>All of them looked overjoyed. Had they just really passed the unconquerable fourth Hall of Causality?</p>

  <p>Janet's lips curved up slightly. It could be said that the Lofty Wood in her hand had contributed a lot to their success, even if she had only used it as a fishing rod.</p>

  <p>At that point, everyone had felt a slight tremor beneath their feet as heavy footsteps echoed behind them.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>After they heard the sounds, everyone turned their heads to look in the direction where they came from.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant that had previously fallen into the lake was now charging towards them at a flashing speed!</p>
