<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In general, these warriors were powerful enough to dominate any province in the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, their lives were in Emperor Charm's hands.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Another starlight descended and landed above the head of a bald man.</p>

  <p>The bald man was called Norbert Chen, a close friend of the Ivory Mountain's leader.</p>

  <p>His eyes were still bloodshot as he hadn't recovered from having watched Emperor Charm kill the mountain leader.</p>

  <p>Now that the starlight fell above his head, the veins in his temples popped out and he roared, "This winged demon is attacking our Oneness Sky Palace! I will try my best to fight him!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Then, he stomped his feet in the air, which distorted the space beneath him.</p>

  <p>His Other Shore Token appeared on his right hand. It was a tiger-shaped gauntlet.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>He rushed towards Emperor Charm as the tiger's eyes on his gauntlet turned red, and an immense power gathered within it.</p>

  <p>His Other Shore Token was of strengthening type, which came from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, he had more than one Other Shore Token!</p>

  <p>Aside from his tiger-shaped gauntlet, he also had another Other Shore Token in the form of a palm-sized wooden compass. He released the compass, and its needle began to spin like mad.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>In turn, Emperor Charm arched his brows at the sight of the compass.</p>

  <p>Norbert Chen's tiger-shaped gauntlet was an ordinary Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Although it came from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, it could only release a power of fifty thousand divine megatons.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the wooden compass was much more powerful!</p>

  <p>It was made of withered wood. Three compasses were discovered in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, but nobody knew who made them. Someone had guessed that the Instant Civilization had deliberately left the compasses behind as a malicious joke for the next generations.</p>

  <p>The compass had three scales, and the first scale read 'one'. If the compass' needle was pointed to one, the power the owner released wouldn't change at all.</p>

  <p>The second scale was zero. If the needle was pointed to zero, the power would return to zero, no matter how strong it was.</p>

  <p>The third scale was three hundred!</p>

  <p>If the compass' needle was turned to three hundred, the power the owner exerted would be multiplied by three hundred times!</p>

  <p>In other words, Norbert Chen could unleash a terrifying power of three million divine megatons if he used the power of ten thousand divine megatons together with the compass!</p>

  <p>Three million divine megatons...</p>

  <p>Not even the supreme masters in the Source World or the Chaos Ancient Gods could withstand such a blow.</p>

  <p>If there were no other restrictions on the compass, it would probably be the strongest Other Shore Token in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>Although there was only a one-third probability of the needle pointing to three hundred, such a force was enough to kill the opponent in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, the compass itself was not a descending type of Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>It meant that the physical body that released the power had to bear all the power first.</p>

  <p>In theory, it might be great to increase one's strength by three hundred times, but in reality, that amount of power could cause the owner's physical body to collapse.</p>

  <p>Despite that, there was still a way to release a certain part of the power even if the physical body collapsed.</p>

  <p>Someone had tried it before Norbert Chen.</p>

  <p>There was a time when the leader of the Mountain Monkey race in the Source World had carried this compass. The Mountain Monkey race was a small race, located beside the Separate Abyss race. The Separate Abyss race had oppressed them for generations. During one battle, the leader of the Mountain Monkey race finally made use of this compass. At the same time, he employed another Other Shore Token, the Paramount Sky Bead!</p>

  <p>His body collapsed after he had used such an uncontrollable force, but the Paramount Sky Bead flew straight and smashed the leader of the Separate Abyss race to death.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that it was a compelling Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race had destroyed the Mountain Monkey race later on, but they had fought to the death until the end.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the powerful masters of the Source World also knew what the compass was for. It was used for desperate moments in battle!</p>

  <p>"Strength! Gather!" Norbert Chen roared.</p>

  <p>The tiger-shaped gauntlet on his hand continuously released surging amounts of power.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>After a while, the compass finally stopped. The needle on the compass slid past zero, past one, and finally stopped at the scale of three hundred.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>Under the influence of the compass, the power in the tiger-shaped gauntlet quickly increased.</p>

  <p>The tiger-shaped gauntlet's strength had originally reached sixty thousand divine megatons, but after it multiplied three hundred, it reached up to eighteen million divine megatons.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The power's immense pressure even caused the space locked up in the Cage of Heaven and Earth to collapse.</p>

  <p>Norbert Chen was filled with grief when he saw that the mountain leader was dead. Now that he had chosen to fight desperately, how could he even hesitate?</p>

  <p>"Sky Splitting Attack!</p>

  <p>Go to hell!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Just as he uttered those words, he had already erupted eighteen million divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>Even the Chaotic Source Spirits that he had nurtured for many years immediately dimmed and became exhausted.</p>

  <p>Yet, his attack also burst along the tiger-shaped gauntlet at the same time!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A tiger-shaped fist shadow suddenly came out of his right hand and sent out a violent punch.</p>

  <p>His current choice was more tragic and terrifying than burning the Other Shore Token. It was a much fiercer desperate battle.</p>

  <p>The punch was so strong that its impact shook the entire Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The tremors were felt even in the mountain far away, where the disciples of the three sword sects felt their legs weaken as they sat on the ground.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the tiger-shaped fist tore up everything in its way and rushed towards Emperor Charm at top speed.</p>

  <p>"The power of this punch is enough to kill Emperor Charm, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Truly. Norbert Chen is not famous in the Ivory Mountain, but he could still launch such a powerful attack before his death..."</p>

  <p>"Millions of divine megatons of power. That Other Shore Token is really amazing!"</p>

  <p>Although the power was terrifying, Emperor Charm still had an indifferent expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"No matter how powerful his strength is, it is useless if he fails to hit the target."</p>

  <p>Just as the tiger-shaped fist shadow approached Emperor Charm, Emperor Charm's body once again turned into fist-sized squares.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race was good at flames and space. This destructive punch was indeed unable to hit Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>But just as Emperor Charm was about to leave, two more people appeared not far away from him.</p>

  <p>One of them grabbed a leaf.</p>

  <p>That leaf turned out to be the Grand Hidden Leaf!</p>

  <p>Under the leaf's cover, even a powerful and agile man like Emperor Charm didn't notice that the two of them had approached him.</p>

  <p>The other man had a small black snake in his hand.</p>

  <p>The little snake was a creature from Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The man and the snake had been together for so many years, and they shared a very deep relationship. He had even found a woman's body for the black snake, taught her to read and speak, and even married her.</p>

  <p>At this moment of life and death, he and the little snake chose to fight until their end.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>The little snake's whole body burned hotly, and then it quickly bit Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm had planned to use the space theurgy to leave, but the little snake bit him, and the bite paralyzed his body. The space theurgy didn't work anymore, and the blue squares disappeared one by one.</p>

  <p>Almost all the powerful warriors at present were top masters who had crossed Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. Thus, how could he kill them all at will?</p>
