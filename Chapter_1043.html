<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1043 Confiding In Yan (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>If there was something that man knew well, it was patience. He only smiled at Luo Zheng and said, "Time doesn't matter to me. Do as you wish."</p>

  <p>Time was limited for most ordinary mortals, but for people like him who had lived for millions of years, it didn't really matter that much.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Luo Zheng glanced at the man before he pulled Yan's hand and walked out of the Ethereal Spirit Hall.</p>

  <p>Although the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been invaded by the Heavenly Evil Sect, it had also been chosen as their temporary headquarters. Therefore, its surroundings were well-preserved and taken care of. It was nothing like the Ethereal City, where the independent warriors had taken away all that they could carry and destroyed those they couldn't.</p>

  <p>As they walked out of the Ethereal Spirit Hall, a green scenery inundated their eyes. It was a sight to behold.</p>

  <p>They walked side by side along a shady path lined by trees. Luo Zheng looked quite calm, while Yan's face was filled with distress. She was bothered by the same question. Why couldn't Luo Zheng just get her out of that place?</p>

  <p>"Why can't you just take me with you?"</p>

  <p>After walking for a short distance, Yan suddenly stopped and asked. There was an unpleasant look in her eyes and her tone resembled that of a kid throwing a tantrum.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Luo Zheng replied with all due honesty, "That man in the hall will be the one to take you, not me."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go with him," Yan replied, shaking her head. They had been separated for such a long time, and now that Luo Zheng had killed Eddie, wasn't it just right for them to reunite? It was unbearable for her to think that they were to be separated again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was very patient with Yan. After all, she was his only sister. They were family.</p>

  <p>With a bitter smile, he explained, "But I can't beat that man. He's very powerful. If I know deep down that I stand a chance against him, I will fight him without any doubt so I can be the one to take you away."</p>

  <p>"How powerful could he be?</p>

  <p>Is he even stronger than Eddie?"</p>

  <p>Yan asked, her eyebrows tied in knots out of extreme curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng sighed with a pang of hopelessness in his heart. "Yes, he is so much stronger than Eddie."</p>

  <p>"What if we just escape now while he can't see us?" Yan suggested as she pouted her lips. 'He didn't bind our hands and feet. We are still free, ' she thought to herself. She found it impossible to comprehend the gap between that man's strength and her brother's.</p>

  <p>"Escape? That's never going to happen,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed, shaking his head. It was as if he had just heard the darkest joke in his life. Escape? From that man? Pretty funny.</p>

  <p>Faced with an expert of that level, he knew that escaping was never going to be a choice.</p>

  <p>To add, there was nowhere to go.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng didn't know much about that man's origin, he was definitely unknown to the Central Region. Luo Zheng reckoned he was most likely from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>According to Zheng's knowledge, if anyone from the Upper World wanted to descend to the Lower World, they were to be bound by many restrictions.</p>

  <p>Only a warrior from their own world could freely come and go. Otherwise, the visitor was to be rejected by the whole world.</p>

  <p>For that exact reason, a warrior who descended from the Upper World was considered to be an enemy of all living beings.</p>

  <p>If a warrior forced his way into the Lower World, he was to face the entire world against him, and his strength was to have limits as well.</p>

  <p>That man, however, wasn't rejected by the world. In Zheng's eyes, it was very possible that the world didn't dare take him as an enemy out of fear. That was how fierce he was.</p>

  <p>No matter where he intended to go, that man could just easily locate him.</p>

  <p>Even if he had gone to the Sea God Continent, that man could get there before he even did.</p>

  <p>So, when Luo Zheng asked if he could take a walk with Yan, it didn't bother him one bit. He wasn't afraid that Luo Zheng would ever plan an escape, because no matter what he did, he never could ever escape him.</p>

  <p>"Yan, do you want to hear some of my adventures in the past two years?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly asked, shifting the topic.</p>

  <p>"Yes, please!" Yan enthusiastically nodded. Although unhappy about their current circumstance, Yan genuinely wanted to know what had happened to her brother in those years that had passed. She was curious about his experiences and how he had managed to eliminate Eddie in just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>"In fact, I saw you at the Oracle City's Martial Arts Contest two years ago.</p>

  <p>But your senses were fully blocked then," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Yan exclaimed, having no single memory of that occurrence at all.</p>

  <p>They continued to stroll along the green path as Luo Zheng told his stories after the last time they saw each other. The Cloud Road test, the enrollment of the Cloud Hall, the Martial Arts Contest, the competition for the Dragon Soar Arena, the fight with Marilyn, the activation of the enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb, the journey to the Sea God Continent...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng told every single experience he had to Yan without any reservation.</p>

  <p>They had been apart for too long, and the truth of all things was the only gift he could give her.</p>
