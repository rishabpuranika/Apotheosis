<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2119 The Proving Godly Warrior </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng's actions intimidated the excited divine citizens.</p>

  <p>He slightly understood what they meant when he heard what they said.</p>

  <p>Some people seemed to be trying to take over the Misty Mountain Village and driving the people out. These divine citizens were unwilling to leave though so their supposed conquerors decided to hire some extra muscles to cause them trouble.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng entered the divine land, he immediately fell onto a vegetable field and then eradicated a great crowd of pests there. Soon he was seen by a boy who immediately took him to the village so that the other divine citizens could team up and kill him.</p>

  <p>Realizing that it was all a misunderstanding, Luo Zheng felt the need to clarify things.</p>

  <p>"I am a mere passerby. I unintentionally crashed into that vegetable field.</p>

  <p>I did not intend to offend anyone. Why did you all attack me though?" he murmured faintly.</p>

  <p>He wasn't angry, not after knowing what was finally going on.</p>

  <p>"Did we misunderstand then?"</p>

  <p>"Weren't you sent here by the Sun Moon Village?"</p>

  <p>The divine citizens all wavered, seeing the innocent look on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I haven't even heard of a Sun Moon Village before."</p>

  <p>"How can we trust you?" one of the divine citizens asked.</p>

  <p>"Just trust me." A friendly smile broke through Zheng's face. "Then you can trust me!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally left the back of the bull in a flash.</p>

  <p>Even if he couldn't launch the Wind Law to fly, he could still make use of the ingenious movement techniques he had learned in the past. To these divine citizens, it appeared as if he simply vanished like a ghost.</p>

  <p>They only felt a light breeze brush past them and suddenly, their grips on their spears loosened and they found themselves without their weapons.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Luo Zheng was already standing in the middle of the village gate with a bundle of spears in his hands.</p>

  <p>Everyone's faces paled in fright. "If I had been sent by the Sun Moon Village, then all of you would've already been dead," he told them indifferently before throwing the spears on the ground.</p>

  <p>Nobody uttered a word to dispute Zheng's claim.</p>

  <p>What he said was reasonable. The strength Luo Zheng had displayed was enough to kill all of them in one sitting. That much was pretty obvious.</p>

  <p>However, the divine citizens were still full of hostility and Luo Zheng couldn't help but despair in his heart.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that he newly crashed here then he wouldn't have bothered with these divine citizens.</p>

  <p>He had to remind himself that this was the divine land and not the universe. The first thing he had to do was to integrate himself and not act on impulse.</p>

  <p>"Everyone! Please trust him. He is not an assassin sent by the Sun Moon Village!" a voice shouted from the village.</p>

  <p>It was a black-haired youth with a long sword strapped to his waist. His eyes were calm and Luo Zheng could immediately tell from a glance that he was at the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>'Is he a warrior of this village?' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of this warrior but these divine citizens still gave him a strange feeling. They did not have any cultivation base but each one of them possessed brute force. The sight of this youth at the Spirit Transformation Realm made Luo Zheng a bit more comfortable.</p>

  <p>"Woolley, what took you so long?" one of the divine citizens snapped.</p>

  <p>Woolley scratched his head in embarrassment. "I've been here the entire time. I just didn't make a move."</p>

  <p>"This man almost killed us. You're the only warrior here and yet you were the one who hid behind us. You're a disgrace to our Misty Mountain Village!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! Why didn't you help us beat him up Woolley?!"</p>

  <p>All the divine citizens protested in anger.</p>

  <p>'They were almost killed by me...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had obviously shown mercy to these divine citizens so what nonsense were they spouting?</p>

  <p>Woolley rolled his eyes. "I'm no match for him either. Even the Sun Moon Village's leader would have some trouble taking him down."</p>

  <p>His evaluation of Zheng's strength shocked the divine citizens to the core.</p>

  <p>Woolley was the strongest warrior and the only hope in their Misty Mountain Village after all and everyone believed what he said.</p>

  <p>Even the Sun Moon Village's leader would have a hard time against this person? 'Isn't that too much exaggeration?' the divine citizens all wondered.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>"Even if this guy is strong, he can't be on that level!"</p>

  <p>"You're just afraid to fight him. That's why you said those things, right Woolley?"</p>

  <p>Woolley blinked. "His cultivation base is the same as that of the Sun Moon Village's leader. He's also a proving godly warrior."</p>

  <p>"Proving godly warrior?!"</p>

  <p>"He's a world lord?"</p>

  <p>"He's that powerful?"</p>

  <p>The divine citizens all looked at Luo Zheng in wide-eyed fear. It was obvious that they all thought of him as a monster.</p>

  <p>The term "proving godly warrior" was unfamiliar to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the moment "world lord" was mentioned, Luo Zheng immediately understood.</p>

  <p>In the universe, the Supreme Lord was usually the strongest warrior, but a world lord could only become one after being granted a Heavenly Destiny. The Supreme Lord was, essentially, a title.</p>

  <p>There were very few True Gods in the universe and most were usually brought over to the divine land by the Jiang Clan. Not a lot of people really knew the True Gods. Tianming's achievement, for example, was only made known to a small portion of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>It was different here in the divine land. There were many True Gods here.</p>

  <p>After becoming a world lord, ordinary creatures that weren't restricted by the heavens would naturally attest to the Godly Way and try to become a True God. This was the reason why world lords were also called proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>"Am I right?" Woolley smiled and asked for confirmation from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He didn't really know Zheng's cultivation base since he could only see through warriors whose cultivation bases were at the Spirit Supreme Realm and below. However, since he couldn't perceive Zheng's cultivation base then that only meant that he was higher— a world lord.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes, I am indeed a proving godly warrior."</p>

  <p>Woolley cupped his hands and bowed. "I'm sorry if they were too rash. I apologize on behalf of our village. If you would allow us to show you the accorded hospitality, please come over and have a chat?"</p>

  <p>The little boy who hid behind Woolley suddenly rushed out. "Woolley, is he really not a bad person that the Sun Moon Village sent?" A look of doubt flashed through his eyes. He had spent a great deal in trying to lure Luo Zheng over and it was incredibly unexpected for things to have become like this.</p>

  <p>Woolley smacked the boy hard on the forehead. "You've got the nerve!</p>

  <p>All of this was caused by you! If he truly was from the Sun Moon Village then you would've been dead by now."</p>

  <p>His words immediately eased the tension. The divine citizens all seemed to believe Woolley's words and felt that Luo Zheng had no enmity towards them at the very least.</p>

  <p>With the misunderstanding solved, Woolley led the way and took Luo Zheng to the largest building in the village.</p>

  <p>Inside the building was a brazier located at the very center. On top of the brazier was a large pot that seemed to be cooking something and emitted a thick fragrance of meat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but stare at the fire. However, he couldn't see through the laws that were contained within the flames.</p>

  <p>His gaze then went to the logs on the bottom of the brazier and he immediately understood that it was this precious pile that gave the flames such a strange quality.</p>

  <p>No wonder Livingston was so excited when he saw the materials in the fairy palace. Rare and precious logs such as these were used as kindling for cooking by common divine citizens.</p>

  <p>The divine citizens were all very accommodating to Luo Zheng and treated him as a guest. A proving godly warrior was a very high status in their eyes after all.</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from, Sir?" Woolley asked. "Why did you come here to our Misty Mountain Village?"</p>

  <p>Even when he was still in the universe, Wynn had already taught Luo Zheng a set of excuses to answer any question that might endanger his real identity.</p>

  <p>"I'm Tianxing Luo. I came from another region and got lost when I went into the Vast Sky Region. I accidentally broke into that vegetable field..." Luo Zheng narrated sheepishly but in his mind, all the information he gave was tied in an orderly manner.</p>

  <p>"You got lost in the Vast Sky Region..." Woolley murmured in astonishment, disbelief written all over his face.</p>
