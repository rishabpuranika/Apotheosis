  <p>
</p>

  <p>Many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had experienced fearsome battles of their own in the Chaotic Source World. Each of these fights came at a cost of their Other Shore Power being drained out. After they gained a moment of rest from all that turmoil, they settled down, and each chose an exclusive spot for them to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirits, they had to get accustomed to their newly acquired power of the Chaotic Source Realm. On the other hand, they also had to replenish their exhausted Other Shore Power to stabilize themselves.</p>

  <p>Compared to all the disciples, Zheng had used up the largest amount of Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>It cost him a great deal of Other Shore Power to summon the Regal Jade statues through the Regal Jade chessboard. Moreover, Zheng had summoned the entire Regal Jade World shortly after, employing the Inheritance of World.</p>

  <p>Although the storage volume of the Civilization Artifact was by no means small, the Other Shore Power in it still wouldn't be enough to support too many powerful skills.</p>

  <p>According to the Regal Jade Spirit, even if there were sufficient amounts of Other Shore Power, Zheng could perform the Regal Jade World two times in one go without a hitch. After that, the entire Other Shore Power stored in the Civilization Artifact would be emptied completely.</p>

  <p>With a series of light thuds on the ground, one after the other, the divine crystals fell from Zheng's space ring and gathered in a pile.</p>

  <p>The number of crystals was so vast that they formed a small mountain of their own and occupied the entire room.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his fingers, streaks of invisible light as sharp as a sword slashed at the divine crystals swiftly. Like cracked open walnuts, the divine crystals split in half effortlessly and unleashed the energy hidden within them relentlessly.</p>

  <p>As if preparing himself, Zheng closed his eyes shut and took in a deep breath to draw his focus in one place.</p>

  <p>As a result, the raging flow of energy running wild around him reacted to his guide and began to converge above him. As if taking the shape of a river, it poured itself wholly into the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>The large pile consisted of three million divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Zheng had to absorb seven such piles of divine crystals to replenish the whole Other Shore Power in the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"It seems it would cost me twenty million divine crystals to use the Civilization Artifact only once…" Zheng muttered under his breath as he estimated the amount in his head and shook his head. A wry smile took shape on his face.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Chiyou had bestowed upon him a great legacy of divine crystals. Originally, he had planned to revive the Nine Li race with them, but soon his self-made bubble of that dream popped right in front of him when he had to face the harsh reality. He soon realized his plans were nothing short of wishful thinking if he relied only on the legacy left behind by Chiyou.</p>

  <p>As the amount of Other Shore Power he could bear continued to grow, replenishing it would require a larger amount of divine crystals. Eventually, the ones he now possessed would be insufficient for his use in the future.</p>

  <p>Upon restoring the power in the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization to maximum capacity, Zheng summoned the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, part of the Other Shore Power of this Civilization Artifact was consumed by the Evil God. What was worse, it was partly burned and damaged. Zheng concluded it would take an outrageous amount of Other Shore Power to repair the weapon back to its perfect condition.</p>

  <p>As soon as he summoned this cubic-shaped object, a familiar nonchalant voice echoed in the room and announced sharply, "Heaven-level first-class task, burn down the entire Pear Hill, and kill over fifty thousand members of the Snake Goddess race. After completing the mission, your reward is…"</p>

  <p>"Heaven-level first-class task, challenge the Snake Goddess. After completing the mission, your reward is..."</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>Perhaps when this artifact was in the Evil God's grip, his violent nature rubbed off on the cube. Most of the tasks assigned by it included various types of slaughtering-like challenges.</p>

  <p>Even if he tried to remove the influence left by the Evil God, it would take up most of his time. Zheng was left with no other choice but to ignore it.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had predicted, this Civilization Artifact consumed much more divine crystals than that of the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>The entirety of Zheng's night was spent replenishing the cube to its maximum potential. The whole ordeal had cost him a large sum of forty million divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Moving onto the next step, Zheng brought out the Strength God Totem.</p>

  <p>After recharging its power with the aid of divine crystals, Zheng quickly activated the totem. Soon, violent streaks of Other Shore Power gushed out from the depths of his stomach. It navigated its way through the meridians of his body, flowing gracefully until it reached his right hand and gathered in one place.</p>

  <p>"1, 000 divine megatons!"</p>

  <p>"1, 100 divine megatons!"</p>

  <p>"1, 200 divine megatons!"</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng's body was able to bear 1, 000 divine megatons of force at once. If he wanted to make his body resilient against more, he had to rely on the Regal Jade chessboard to summon forth the Regal Jade statues. An alternative way was to activate the Inheritance of World.</p>

  <p>But now, after absorbing the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, his bearing capacity of Other Shore Power and his strength had grown by leaps and bounds.</p>
