<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1372 The Enchanted Barrier Tower </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Layla had finally succeeded in arousing Luo Zheng's curiosity, and her face now revealed a complacent smile.</p>

  <p>She then raised one corner of her mouth in a meaningful way and smiled,</p>

  <p>"You said that you don't want to say anything and just want to focus on studying the stone carving, right?"</p>

  <p>In response, Luo Luo Zheng merely glared at her with a cold gaze. He seemed to dislike being kept in suspense.</p>

  <p>Layla seemed to sense that and stopped beating around the bush. "The most important part in the Passing the Torch is to advance through the Law Storm. The storm is formed of every single law power in the entire universe and can be a bit, feisty..."</p>

  <p>"Every single type of law is contained in the storm?" Luo Luo Zheng confirmed.</p>

  <p>Layla nodded. "Yes. But don't worry. Those laws are extremely fragmented, left behind by numerous Supreme Lords as they fought in the past. The Law Storm is imprisoned within the Enchanted Barrier Tower!"</p>

  <p>The Enchanted Barrier Tower had also been left behind by a Supreme Lord. In appearance, it was much like a tower, but was in fact, an enchanted barrier. It had been created many years ago and things were much different now.</p>

  <p>Several Supreme Lords had fought in the Orange Sea World, which ended up disintegrating this supreme world. As a result, the laws left behind by them had become disordered and uncontrolled, making the Orange Sea World a dangerous and chaotic place. Any warrior visiting it would be dead within seconds if he or she wasn't careful enough and got trapped in the chaotic law current.</p>

  <p>Later, a human Supreme Lord had taken a planned risk and gathered all of the law currents together, trapping and enveloping them within the Enchanted Barrier Tower. The broken Orange Sea World gradually became peaceful after that.</p>

  <p>The chaotic law currents within the Enchanted Barrier Tower had also weakened over time, losing much of their energy. Later on, they interacted and formed a storm. But time had passed so much since then that even the storm's might had weakened by a great deal. In the last several hundred years, it had weakened enough to be used as a method of testing the warriors of thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>After hearing Layla's instructions, Luo Luo Zheng understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>No wonder the warriors of thirteen palaces were required to comprehend those stone carvings; they had six types of laws on each of their six sides. The Law Storm was actually a combination of many different Original Laws, which meant that in order to resist it, they needed to comprehend a sufficient amount of Law Power.</p>

  <p>"So we are going to make an effort at the last moment, huh? It would be useless you know. Even if we spend twenty days cultivating here, it won't be enough. Forget about forty hours! If you want to make greater achievement in the Law Storm, you will have to rely on your accumulation of knowledge and cultivation base in the past!" Layla told him arrogantly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at her indifferently, realizing that she was both proud and confident in herself.</p>

  <p>"Even so, I have to do what I have to do," Luo Luo Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>"Look! I told you. It's just useless! Like I said, I don't need to comprehend this stone carving. I can surely obtain first place and break the record here without doing that! Let's just chat!" Layla smiled.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes in response. "Layla! I'm not as confident as you are."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he didn't raise his head anymore and instead concentrated on observing the stone carving in his hand. He was going to ignore her if she kept on nagging him like that.</p>

  <p>When Layla saw that Luo Luo Zheng was ignoring her, a resentful expression once again appeared on her face. However, after a second thought, her smile returned. She was very confident in herself. She also knew that Luo Luo Zheng would surely be very dejected if he could not perform better than her in the test after he had tried to contemplate the stone carving so earnestly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could clearly understand what Layla was thinking about. But he just kept on staring intently at the stone carving, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>If all the six Law Powers were fused together at the same time, what effect would that lead to?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already seen the perfect fusion of two kinds of Law Power before. For example, Fenton's sword art was a perfect fusion of the Metal Law and the Wind Law.</p>

  <p>However, it was already extremely hard to fuse even two of the Original Laws together, let alone all six of them.</p>

  <p>Some of the Original Laws reinforced, and some of them restricted each other; for example, the Fire Law and Water Law were exact opposites.</p>

  <p>Their restraints on each other were the most obvious among the laws of five elements.</p>

  <p>But was there really no one in this world who could mix all kinds of Law Power together?</p>

  <p>Of the six kinds of Law Power on this stone carving, the fusions were pairwise. Moreover, the fusions of any two laws weren't complete.</p>

  <p>Further, Luo Luo Zheng still didn't know how powerful that Law Storm was. He couldn't imagine what would happen if several different kinds of laws came together and acted on a single point, but he could obtain the fusion method from the stone carving.</p>

  <p>Very quickly, Luo Luo Zheng entered a state of immersion.</p>

  <p>Most of the thousands of warriors from thirteen palaces had also sunk into the world of laws, just like Luo Luo Zheng. They were trying to comprehend as much of these carvings as possible.</p>

  <p>Layla was bored and even started to stretch herself. Seeing the serious expressions on Luo Zheng's face, she curled her lips and finally, with nothing to do, also picked up the stone carving.</p>

  <p>The warriors only had forty hours to comprehend the stone carvings and they were trying to make the most of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been standing in front of the huge stone and was delayed for a couple of hours. Therefore, after Luo Luo Zheng had meditated only for about thirty hours, a voice simultaneously sounded in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>"Alright, folks! Time is up! Please put down the stone carvings in your hands and enter the Enchanted Barrier Tower! Quickly now!" The voice belonged to the old man dressed in cotton clothes and standing near the tower.</p>

  <p>The warriors, who were standing at the side of the square put down the stone carvings and quickly stood up.</p>

  <p>Everyone was naturally well-prepared to participate in the Passing the Torch. But some of them were more confident than ever, while some had hesitant expressions on their faces. Some of them also uttered, "I wonder what the reward is this time."</p>

  <p>The old man in cotton clothes continued speaking indifferently, unfazed by the mutters, "This time, those who can reach a thousand miles will be rewarded with a Tribulation Exterminating Pill!"</p>

  <p>"Tribulation Exterminating Pill?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Layla immediately explained, "The Tribulation Exterminating Pill is a powerful medicine that can extinguish the punishment imposed on us by the heavens!"</p>

  <p>"Destroy the Heavenly Tribulation directly?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously, "But from my estimate, the warriors here probably don't need the Tribulation Exterminating Pill, right?"</p>

  <p>To an ordinary warrior, the Tribulation Exterminating Pill might be incomparably important. Some of them would really suffer a lot while undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation, and if they weren't careful, they could end up dead!</p>

  <p>In the past, when Luo Luo Zheng had undergone a small Heavenly Tribulation, he had been almost killed by the black light.</p>

  <p>However, undergoing the tribulation even once was extremely beneficial for the warriors themselves. The warriors of thirteen palaces were talented people from tenth-grade sacred places. Going through the tribulation was actually a good thing for them. Layla, a warrior at the ninth level of the Life and Death Realm, was looking forward to the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation!</p>

  <p>To these warriors, exterminating the tribulation was not a good thing, but would be a great loss, since they were in no danger but would lose its effects.</p>

  <p>Layla slightly smiled and replied, "Of course not! The Tribulation Exterminating Pill isn't able to completely destroy the Heavenly Tribulation! If that were the case, then I wouldn't want it! The Tribulation Exterminating Pill can only delay the arrival of the Heavenly Tribulation! If a warrior is already in danger or severely injured, it would be inconvenient for him to undergo the Heavenly Tribulation. If the Heavenly Tribulation arrives, then this Tribulation Exterminating Pill can be used to delay the Heavenly Tribulation!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head, thinking what Layla was saying made sense. Back when he was in the Sea God Continent, the two ogre sacred places had launched a surprise attack during the absence of Amber who had gone out to undergo the tribulation. Although Amber had successfully passed through the tribulation and come back in time, both she and her race had been in an extremely dangerous situation while she was gone.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Tribulation Exterminating Pill could indeed be of some use at a critical moment.</p>

  <p>"Reaching one thousand miles will get you only one Tribulation Exterminating Pill..."</p>

  <p>"Mmm. This reward for Passing the Torch seems to be too small!</p>

  <p>"Are there any other prizes? Please tell us..."</p>

  <p>These warriors were participating in Passing the Torch just for its rewards. Naturally, they would pay attention to them and want bigger ones to be present.</p>

  <p>The old man continued, "Those who can travel three thousand miles will be rewarded with a secondary first-rank divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been slightly interested in the Tribulation Exterminating Pill. He felt a bit of a lack of interest when it came to the secondary first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors from thirteen palaces, they were also somewhat dissatisfied.</p>

  <p>"I heard that the warriors who traveled three thousand miles in the last Passing the Torch were rewarded with first-rank divine weapons, but this year the reward is just a secondary first-rank divine weapon... So cheap!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, the rewards seem to have decreased in grade this time. What happened I wonder?"</p>

  <p>The old man dressed in cotton clothes didn't care about everyone's dissatisfaction and continued with his announcement, "As for the reward of traveling ten thousand miles, I will announce it when someone of you is able to make it!"</p>

  <p>Obviously, the old man wanted to keep everyone guessing and increase suspense.</p>

  <p>The crowd was naturally unhappy...</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult to advance through the Law Storm. Very few warriors would be able to move forward even for a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>As for reaching the three thousand miles mark, most likely, only about a dozen warriors would be able to do so.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand miles was a dream that was unimaginable. The warriors of thirteen palaces wondered whether there was even a single warrior who could travel ten thousand miles. To be honest, there was no point in announcing the rewards of this case. No one would make it!</p>

  <p>Although everyone was dissatisfied, no one chose to give up. They were clear that the benefits attained by Passing the Torch were not limited to just this. If they were able to achieve a good result, then they would be highly valued in the palaces. And they could also get a lot of resources several times more than they had now.</p>
