  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was a cross-shaped sword light!</p>

  <p>The cross-shaped sword light seemed to possess the power to destroy the worlds. Without any delay, the sword light hacked down towards Luo Luo Zheng from above!</p>

  <p>Along the way, the sword light collided with many stars...</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the sword light touched the stars, they would be completely destroyed. Without any exception, the stars were obliterated by the sword light.</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>After he looked at the ray of sword light, the head of the Celestial Position race took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"This is troublesome. A Holy Being has finally taken action," Blayd said as he frowned. Distress was apparent in his eyes. Additionally, he also once again made a guess at what had really happened.</p>

  <p>Once a war between two universes began, it was almost impossible for Holy Beings in the two universes to meddle in the war. The stone slab with the rules recorded on it was not just for show. The rules were supposed to be followed by everyone in the divine land, even the Holy Beings. Once the rules were broken, even a Holy Being would be punished and pay a heavy price.</p>

  <p>Blayd had also heard of the feud between Murphy and Luo Xiao. Even if these two Holy Beings were mortal enemies, there was no need for Murphy to be in such a rush. However, Murphy badly desired Luo Zheng's death, and even the terror from the punishment of the stone slab was not enough to discourage him.</p>

  <p>The punishment must be considered dangerous and risky to his own life...</p>

  <p>Since Murphy willingly accepted the punishment of the stone slab in order to kill Luo Luo Zheng, then there must be a hidden reason behind his actions.</p>

  <p>"Does the Holy Being really make a move?"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, run away!"</p>

  <p>"Where should we go? Can we even escape a Holy Being's attack?"</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords present were shocked by the scene.</p>

  <p>Nervousness had already crippled their hearts.</p>

  <p>When the war began, the Supreme Lords considered themselves the protagonists of the war. However, it was not long before they realized that it was the disciples of the Holy Beings, the True Gods, who decided the victory or defeat of the war.</p>

  <p>In the end, they finally understood that they were only mere pawns in the catastrophic war.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that even the Holy Being would get involved now! The Supreme Lords thought of themselves as mere ants in a storm.</p>

  <p>"Holy Murphy!"</p>

  <p>"Plop!"</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord knelt on the ground all of a sudden. His face was painted with submission to authority.</p>

  <p>The dim and gloomy spinulose wood fern seemed to sense Murphy's Mu Ning. At that moment, waves of precious light constantly flashed within the trunk of the tree.</p>

  <p>"Plop, plop, plop..."</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race knelt down one after another.</p>

  <p>Murphy was the God of Creation in the Murphy Universe. His existence was also the faith of all the members of the Sacred race. It was only at that moment that they realized that Murphy hadn't abandoned them.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being himself had personally made a move!</p>

  <p>Since the Holy Being was forced to take action, would the Murphy Universe still have a chance of victory?</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>As the cross-shaped sword right continued to descend, more and more stars collided with it. Naturally, the number of stars that were shattered by the sword light increased as well. Thunderous sounds of explosions resounded throughout the entire universe. Each explosion brought fear into the hearts of the creatures that heard it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his head to look at the sky and remained motionless. The cross-shaped sword light reflected in his black eyes. He knew that he could not avoid the sword light, and the sword strike from a Holy Being was not so easy to dodge. Conviction was apparent in his eyes. Then he said calmly, "Xun, you should leave here now..."</p>

  <p>When Xun heard Luo Zheng's words, she suddenly grabbed Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Moisture began to invade her eyes as she shook her head. "I'm not leaving!"</p>

  <p>"It's meaningless to die here with me," Luo Luo Zheng said resolutely. His expression was accompanied by intense yet merciful eyes.</p>

  <p>His father had speculated a lot of things and left enough trump cards to help Luo Luo Zheng win the war. But he had never thought that Murphy would personally take action. Such a rash action was unforeseen.</p>

  <p>However, even if Luo Xiao had predicted that Murphy would act, he could still do nothing about it. Helplessness would cripple him. After all, currently, Luo Xiao was no different from a dead man. He couldn't fight against another Holy Being!</p>

  <p>"Alas, I didn't want to reveal my real body here, but it seems like I have no other choice. This unusual circumstance has forced me to do this..."</p>

  <p>A faint voice suddenly sounded out in the ears of all the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The voice contained a mysterious quality that left an impression they could never forget for the rest of their lives!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the woman in blue clothes appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng. A beautiful face partnered by a slim figure made the woman irresistibly gorgeous. She looked at Luo Luo Zheng with a resentful expression. "Why did you ask me for help before? Why don't you ask for help now? Are you afraid that I cannot withstand the Holy Being's sword strike?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the woman in blue and smiled faintly. Afterward, he showed a callous expression and replied honestly, "Yes!"</p>

  <p>"You just underestimate me too much." The woman in blue shook her head. A pout was seen in her delicate lips. She then looked towards the sky. "I am not a match for the Holy Being, but it shouldn't be difficult for me to block this sword strike..."</p>

  <p>After they saw her appear suddenly, all of the Supreme Lords were shocked once more. They couldn't believe that she would attempt to block the Holy Being's sword strike! Wasn't the woman in blue way too arrogant?</p>
