  <p>At this point, Luo Luo Zheng abruptly butted in and said with a stern voice, "Master Yu, I think I may have found a way to go against Eddie."</p>

  <p>Imogen instantaneously sneered at Luo Luo Zheng and shot him a scornful glare, "Do you honestly think he won't be able to do anything to you even after what you've done? You killed Marilyn right in front of his very eyes. Were it not for the World Commercial Alliance, you would have already been reduced to ashes by now and breathed your last breath! If a warrior would be foolish enough to believe that he has the capability of doing something just because luck has fortunately been on his side at one time rather than pin his hopes on his own strength, all I can say is that you won't be as lucky the second time around."</p>

  <p>"I consider luck to be one of my strengths as well. Master Yu, could you please let me continue what I was trying to say?" Luo Luo Zheng tried his best to politely ask for permission.</p>

  <p>"Okay then, you may continue," Imogen calmly responded. It was so apparent that she did not have a good perception of Luo Luo Zheng. His sister had been taken away, but he still had the audacity to blame all of it on Ning Yudie. A young warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm, that was all that he was, and he had the nerve to unreasonably put the blame on her apprentice. How did anyone expect her to put up with this?</p>

  <p>In any case, Imogen was able to notice clear as day how Ning Yudie appeared to have been harboring some feelings for Luo Luo Zheng. She had been quite partial to him in whatever he did and so fond of him. For that reason, Imogen felt like she had to hold herself back with anything that had to do with him. Apart from that, everyone had an inkling that Luo Luo Zheng had somehow been blessed with good fortune. Imogen was a being who had experienced crossing the line between life and death and had a thorough comprehension of life and death.</p>

  <p>How could she possibly fail to see Luo Zheng's great destiny?</p>

  <p>To be completely fair, when it came to warriors, their destiny was something much too arduous to put to words.</p>

  <p>People who had been blessed with great destiny found it relatively hard to die and they even had the power to engulf other people's destinies. If a crowd of people were to journey off into a hazardous place, the one with the mightiest destiny could end up devouring everyone else's destinies, leading them all to their demise. Only the one blessed with great fortune would be able to make it out alive, take home with different kinds of treasures, and keep himself away from harm.</p>

  <p>What Imogen had been truly terrified of was that Luo Zheng's destiny could end up being much too strong that he might unfortunately end up consuming the destiny of the entirety of Cloud Hall, thus, bringing desolation toward the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had no way of knowing that Imogen had actually been worrying about something to that extent. When he spoke again, he simply stated, "I'm planning to forfeit in the Martial Arts Contest."</p>

  <p>"Why would you do that?" The deep folds and creases on Imogen's forehead wriggled as she gave Luo Luo Zheng a confused look.</p>

  <p>The final results of the competition had become much clearer at that point.</p>

  <p>The winner could probably be either Luo Luo Zheng or Brent. Anyhow, right next to the Venerable Starry, there sat a female disciple who had her face hidden behind a mask all throughout, and she also hadn't shown her strength yet.</p>

  <p>That only kept some people on their wit's end trying to take a guess.</p>

  <p>Taking everything into consideration, Luo Luo Zheng had such a high probability of standing on top of the other competitors.</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes instantly dilated with her eyebrows raised as she stared at Luo Luo Zheng in utter confusion, left totally dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"I intend to lend the Cloud Hall a hand in constructing a sect-protecting array," Luo Luo Zheng carefully told them.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Soar Arena was something of so much importance to Luo Luo Zheng, but he was the sole person who had knowledge of the secret of the Dragon Soar Arena. Frankly speaking, any person who stepped foot in the Dragon Soar Arena would have only reached an impasse. The person not only would end up being unable to gain anything for himself, he would also end up being confined there for a thousand years. This was no laughing matter, and for most of the people, spending a thousand years in prison was synonymous to receiving a death penalty.</p>

  <p>"Sect-protecting array?" Those words seemed to have piqued Imogen's interest based on the look she had on her face.</p>

  <p>Just moments prior to then, everyone was able to feast their eyes on the strength of the enchanted barrier Luo Luo Zheng had constructed, and it should be noted that this was the power of just more than a hundred runes. If the Cloud Hall could successfully put up an array utilizing thousands of runes somehow, then it might just be able to protect itself against Eddie!</p>

  <p>"Is it for certain that you would be able to construct an array that's powerful enough to block Eddie?" Imogen curiously questioned him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm about eighty percent sure," Luo Luo Zheng bobbed his head along.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Luo Luo Zheng was actually one hundred percent certain that he could pull it off, but he just wanted to avoid giving others the impression that he was so way over his head. Just to be sure, he wanted to leave some room for error. Right after the cyan dragon consumed the Owl Beast's evil spirit, he finally got his soul power replenished. In the event that Luo Luo Zheng would run into some sort of trouble, he could still call out to the cyan dragon for assistance.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had the capacity to construct a Grand Marvellous Array, one type of grand array that had enough force to lay waste to both heaven and earth. To put up an array for a fourth-grade sect to shelter it against masters of the Life and Death Realm shouldn't prove to be too difficult for someone like him to carry out.</p>

  <p>Imogen possessed vast experience up her sleeve. It shouldn't be too hard for her to see the merit of Luo Zheng's suggestion.</p>

  <p>She lightly bobbed her head and remarked, "If that is indeed true, then there should be no need for indecision. Once you construct the sect-protecting array, our Cloud Hall will take care of all the materials and fees! You have my word!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Imogen's remarks, Luo Luo Zheng deeply thought to himself, 'Well, isn't that just a foolish thing to say? If I lend you a hand in setting up the sect-protecting array, it is a given that you would be the one to shoulder the cost of the materials. After all, who else was she expecting to pay for everything? That is quite a peculiar old lady...' Needless to say, there was no way he could ever dare say that out loud though.</p>
