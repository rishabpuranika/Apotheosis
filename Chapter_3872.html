<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3872 Swallow </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Separate Amber Province looked like a rag. As the two fought, it began rolling, wrinkling, and tearing.</p>

  <p>Creatures that resided on the rag died miserably? they didn't even have any clue what had happened. All they felt was how heaven and earth collapsed.</p>

  <p>Even the few people who were aware of what happened weren't capable of resisting in a battle of this caliber.</p>

  <p>The boundary wall that could only be broken down by the Eternal Realm warriors' full strength grew weak under the impact.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Once the south of the Separate Amber Province sank, the ground was split into two? a crack that extended millions of miles revealed the scene in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The negative pressure produced as a result then attracted the chaotic clouds nearby which then swarmed toward the crack.</p>

  <p>While the creatures of the Separate Amber Province could only sit still and wait for death, the Taiyi Heaven Palace's members still held a glimmer of hope for life.</p>

  <p>The weakest disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace present were now at the Other Shore Realm, free from the threat of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>But during the battle between Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven, only a slight impact could cause them either death or injury.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, run to the west!"</p>

  <p>"If you get lost, head for the Li Shan mountain!"</p>

  <p>"To the west! Go through the boundary wall!"</p>

  <p>The initially indestructible boundary wall was now riddled with holes, no longer able to stop everyone from escaping.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue, Pearce, and the rest quickly organized the Taiyi Heaven Palace's disciples for smoother passage through it.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, the disciples of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race all returned to their respective flying ships.</p>

  <p>A battle of this level had already completely disrupted the initial plan, but so long as they made it to the Li Shan mountain, survival wasn't impossible.</p>

  <p>All the while, Claire was occupying the Xuanyuan's body. The Divine Farmer had just been freed from a goat monster's state, and Mahoney had died. They had no time to worry about the lives of the Holy Soul Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Another crack appeared on the ground as thousands of clods were thrown into the sky? each clod was as huge as over a hundred mountains.</p>

  <p>In one of the clods, a two-winged earth dragon was curling up. Once it felt movement from outside, it quickly came out of the clod, only to find it was already high in the sky.</p>

  <p>Although it had reached the True God Realm, it wasn't all that intelligent? while it was still thinking hard about what exactly was going on, a flame shot toward it.</p>

  <p>When the flame was still dozens of miles away, the heat it emitted had instantly burned the earth dragon through and through.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't want Othniel behind him to be any hindrance, so he simply stuffed him into another spatial treasure, the Fishing Drum. The two of them displayed incredible flexibility in a series of battles.</p>

  <p>While Claire had occupied the Xuanyuan's body through the eyeball, her strength wasn't affected in the least? she held no disadvantage in the face of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster of Heaven? This is the second time I've fought with you, isn't it? It doesn't seem like you've made any progress," Claire said with a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven remained composed, but he was rather surprised.</p>

  <p>In terms of real strength, he was at the Eye Spirit's level? after fighting each other several times, this point was already proven.</p>

  <p>But while in the Element Spirit race, Claire was ranked third in terms of strength, a great gap remained between her and the Eye Spirit. At least, the Grandmaster of Heaven wasn't taking her seriously back then.</p>

  <p>In just a few chaotic eras, she had managed to grow so strong, exceeding his imagination.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>While he was lost in thought, Claire used Luo Zheng to swing at him once again.</p>

  <p>It had to be noted? in this state, Luo Zheng was an absolutely perfect weapon.</p>

  <p>He had already managed to restrain several of the Grandmaster of Heaven's trump cards? he was a highly specialized weapon that could absorb all sorts of energy. Most importantly, it was impossible to damage him.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Luo Zheng, the Grandmaster of Heaven was stuck in a passive situation.</p>

  <p>After obtaining their freedom, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess flew to the southwest of the Separate Amber Province and stayed put.</p>

  <p>"I thought I was the strongest in the chaos, but these two really are quite surprising?" Fuxi said resentfully, watching both Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven up in the sky.</p>

  <p>"They've lived through over a thousand chaotic eras. Of course, you can't even think of comparing yourself with them," remarked the Snake Goddess calmly.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race, the Element Spirit race, and even the Snake Goddess were determined to get their hands on Luo Zheng. Now that their strength proved to be unequal to the task, they had to rely on a good strategy.</p>

  <p>And while the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire were distracted in battle, they had a chance.</p>

  <p>As for the Black Ship, the captain wasn't watching the battle unfold.</p>

  <p>If the Grandmaster of Heaven was defeated, the Black Ship would be doomed. Therefore, the captain merely had to wait for the result.</p>

  <p>After all, he had something far more important to take care of.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Another two Descending Rings were activated.</p>

  <p>Then, two members of the Nihility race appeared before the captain.</p>

  <p>One turned out to be Samantha, the Grandmaster of Heaven's disciple, and the other was the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The latter glanced at the members of the Black Ship before snorting dismissively.</p>

  <p>To that, the brass man's face immediately darkened. "Do you have something to say?"</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship were not to be underestimated, after all.</p>

  <p>It was with the Black Ship's help that the Evil God could grow so fast, get rid of Luo Zheng, and enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But he'd become rather supercilious soon after getting strong.</p>

  <p>"Just leave him alone. He was cocky enough when he was weak," Shera said, smiling at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled right back at her as though they were good friends that hadn't seen each other for a time.</p>

  <p>It was because of Shera that he could stay on the Black Ship? she had proven to be greatly patient.</p>

  <p>"Where is the incarnation of the evil will?" Samantha chimed in and broke the tension.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," said the captain, nodding at Edith.</p>

  <p>Once Edith stretched out her hands, an invisible space ship enveloped everyone. The next moment, it appeared in the west of the Separate Amber Province, where the Li Shan mountain and the Bearing race had first fought.</p>

  <p>As the Divine Farmer chased the Invisible Ship, he consumed far too much of Usman's power, leaving the latter very weak.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was bound to the Separate Amber Province. So long as it wasn't completely destroyed, he wouldn't perish.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Invisible Ship descended.</p>

  <p>All the members of the Black Ship, the Evil God, and Samantha appeared before Usman.</p>

  <p>As the latter raised his hand, his gaze fell upon Shera and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>From Shera, he could feel a specific kind of emotion that seemed to have something to do with him.</p>

  <p>Looking at the arrogant Evil God, he saw a bit of himself.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>With the group approaching aggressively, he knew something bad was about to happen.</p>

  <p>But he didn't seem to feel a sense of belonging to the Bearing race. He was like a drop of oil floating in the water, impossible for him to join any kind of force.</p>

  <p>If he was forced to join the Black Ship, though, he wasn't going to refuse.</p>

  <p>"This is the incarnation of the Source World's evil will. You will swallow him," said Shera firmly, pointing at Usman.</p>

  <p>At that, Usman was instantly shocked. He raised his head to look Shera square in the eye. He wasn't afraid of anything, not even the warriors at the Eternal Realm, but now, a cold shiver just ran down his spine.</p>
