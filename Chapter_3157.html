<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After listening intently to Dorothy's explanation, Luo Zheng's mind wandered off towards thinking what type of Other Shore Token the Eye of Will was.</p>

  <p>Up until now, he never imagined the Eye of Will could get any stronger.</p>

  <p>But, knowing the Dreaded Eye Demons were one of the largest races that ever existed in history, and they had only produced nineteen Eyes of Will, he felt there might be something he had overlooked in this Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, someone asked a question that disrupted Luo Zheng's flow of thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Are there any Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type for us?"</p>

  <p>The words of the purple Soul of Light might have ignited their interest.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light shook his head and said, "Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type are not easy to find in the Lust World. We managed to acquire some of them, but none of them are stored in the temple."</p>

  <p>"Even if there is, it can't be fused by ordinary people. If you want to carry an Other Shore Token of the mysterious type, then at the very least, you need to have a Hundred Sanskrit Land!" another purple Soul of Light standing outside the plate stepped up and added to his statement.</p>

  <p>Most of these people were capable of only opening a Ten Sanskrit Land, thus they could not merge with a powerful Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"But if you want, there is a chance for you to witness an Other Shore Token of the mysterious type," the person standing on the plate said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Bro, didn't you happen to possess one such Other Shore Token?" he turned to his companion and asked sincerely.</p>

  <p>The last and most silent-natured of the three purple Souls of Light gave an acknowledging nod and said, "Since there is no outsider here, I can make an exception and show it to you."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he slightly raised his hand and a bright glimmer flashed in his soul. Following that, a delicate fish scale appeared on top of his head.</p>

  <p>"This scale was obtained from a lake at Stage Twelve. I can double my strength if I use it," the man explained while flaunting the scale.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his explanation, the atmosphere inside the Seclusion Door suddenly became lively, and the people started discussing among themselves. Everyone's eyes were fixated on the fish scale, and their expressions revealed hints of envy and greed.</p>

  <p>A single fish scale with the ability to double one's power made them feel excited.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng remained calm. He wasn't moved at all.</p>

  <p>Something like this would never surprise him since he already had seen Other Shore Tokens similar in value in the past.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was being chased by Phoenix in the Mountain Viewing Province, he had been forced to use two Latent Theurgies, one of which was the Exhausting Power and was similar to this scale.</p>

  <p>However, the Exhausting Power far surpassed the fish scale in strength.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng used it, his power multiplied by five times as much from before.</p>

  <p>And what about the Nine Li warrior who had the Divine Pulse Deadwood?</p>

  <p>How many times could this person's strength be increased? Twenty times?</p>

  <p>Or even fifty times?</p>

  <p>"Now that we're done with the introduction," the purple Soul of Light standing on plate said politely, and he then turned to face Dorothy and continued, "You may choose your Other Shore Token now."</p>

  <p>"What about my friend?" Dorothy gestured towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Of course, he can as well." The purple Soul of Light bowed respectfully.</p>

  <p>Since the three of them had guessed Dorothy's status, how could they turn her down?</p>

  <p>Even though there was no such thing as diversity in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, there were a few exceptions who enjoyed privileges because of their status.</p>

  <p>Before Dorothy could ask Luo Zheng to choose first, the entire room went in utter chaos with protesting disciples.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't we get to choose before them because we came here first?"</p>

  <p>"Why are they allowed to bypass the rules? Is it because of the woman's status? That is so unfair to us!"</p>

  <p>"You can check the temple records, I was the first one to come here!"</p>

  <p>Usually, these disciples would be hesitant to go against Dorothy. However, because they had the upper hand in numbers, they vocalized their thoughts freely.</p>

  <p>"Quiet down! All of you! Maintain the protocol of the temple or get out of here!" The cold voice of the purple Soul of Light echoed in the ears of every being in the temple.</p>

  <p>But then, Dorothy waved her hand to ask him to stop and said, "Forget it.</p>

  <p>We don't mind waiting a little longer. After all, our goal is to obtain the Other Shore Tokens in the innermost circle."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens on the plate came with certain expectations for the warriors who wished to carry them. Even if they wanted to pick up the Other Shore Tokens in the center, they had to have enough strength to do so!</p>

  <p>Since Dorothy didn't seem to mind them going first, the purple Soul of Light bowed to her wishes and turned to the disciples, "In that case, everyone line up, you can choose your Other Shore Tokens in the order of your coming."</p>

  <p>After that was decided, one of the disciples waiting at the front row stepped up towards the plate.</p>

  <p>Just as the man stepped on it, it began to shake slightly as if reacting to his aura. Soon after, green light began to flash on the plate.</p>

  <p>From the outermost layer, circles of lush green light began to glow as it spread into the center.</p>

  <p>One, two, three, four, five...</p>

  <p>The green light covered the first five circles completely, while in the sixth circle, only several beams of the light shrouded three Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Carefully watching this scenario, Luo Zheng became curious. He turned to Dorothy and whispered in a low voice, "What does the green light on the plate indicate?"</p>

  <p>"This plate is called the Earth Sanskrit Plate, and its origins are vast. It can sense the strength of the Sanskrit Land in one's inner world. And thus the show of green lights, means the Other Shore Tokens that he could carry,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy explained patiently.</p>

  <p>As they were engaged in conversation, the man walked straight to the sixth circle, and picked one from the three Other Shore Tokens that were shining with green light, and then returned back to his place.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stepped off the Earth Sanskrit Plate, the lights slowly diffused one by one until they weren't seen.</p>

  <p>Following him, the other disciples took turns to choose their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Each time a disciple stepped on it, the lights would flash green for up to five or six circles at best, and therefore, they only chose from Stage Five or Stage Six Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>This was an exclusive treatment for these powerful disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. The members of smaller forces could never imagine such a feat.</p>

  <p>One after another, the Souls of Light stepped onto the Earth Sanskrit Plate and took away the Other Shore Tokens. The number of the Other Shore Tokens in the fourth, the fifth, and the sixth circles reduced sharply.</p>

  <p>Each time someone took a rather powerful Other Shore Token, a disappointed sigh would enunciate from the back rows. Since the one they wanted to have was possessed by another, they had no choice but to select a different one.</p>

  <p>For the ones that followed close behind them, they had to resign themselves to choosing an Other Shore Token in the third circle. Some Other Shore Tokens with special abilities could still be a worthy alternative for them.</p>

  <p>A handful of them were prominent warriors with a steady Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>When they leaped on the Earth Sanskrit Plate, they managed to light up eight, or even nine green circles. These people could naturally choose a stronger Other Shore Token compared to the rest.</p>

  <p>After a long wait, it was finally Luo Zheng's turn to pick.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere suddenly became hostile, and several glares filled with disdain followed him as he made his way to the plate. They inaugurated a debate among themselves, to guess the potential of his strength.</p>

  <p>"This guy has a remarkably powerful soul, but his inner world might be an ordinary one!"</p>

  <p>"Hmm, a guy who has to rely on a woman can't be that strong!"</p>

  <p>"I bet only two circles will react to his power. Haha!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paid no heed to their remarks and gently leaped on the Earth Sanskrit Plate.</p>

  <p>As if reacting to his presence, circles of green light began to spread beneath his feet. One, two... Nine, ten...</p>

  <p>Soon, the green light spread to the center till it covered all thirteen circles, which meant that he could carry every Other Shore Token on the Earth Sanskrit Plate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, silence raided the walls of the entire room, and the hostile remarks were cut off by Luo Zheng's impressive show of power. Even the purple Souls of Light were caught off guard.</p>

  <p>If it was done by Dorothy, they might not be so overwhelmed. They all knew that the owner of the Necklace of Mystic Soul was the granddaughter of the prominent figure on the Origin Mountain. In fact, they would feel strange if she couldn't bear an Other Shore Token from the first thirteen stages.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was unfamiliar to them and his strength far surpassed their expectations. The three purple Souls of Light began to guess his identity among themselves, wondering who this astounding guy could be.</p>
