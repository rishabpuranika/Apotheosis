  <p>
</p>

  <p>The great forces and clans in the bone towers did not consider such things as secrets.</p>

  <p>Yet, numerous pariahs in the Immemorial Wilderness, as well as the Wild Gods in the cities had no idea about it.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until now that Luo Zheng had realized a major problem. "As you've said, the Light of Adjudication will purify the world every one thousand years. How many years are left before the next purification of the Light of Adjudication?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Zelda blinked and calmly said, "There are still three years left."</p>

  <p>"So that means, all the people outside of the bone towers will die if they don't make it inside the bone towers within three years?" "Yes," Zelda said and lowered her head.</p>

  <p>"This is going to be troublesome."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng's lips stretched into a wry smile. The Curse Chain had bound him and he was now stuck in this world.</p>

  <p>He couldn't leave, let alone flee back to the divine land.</p>

  <p>He had to go inside a bone tower if he wanted to survive.</p>

  <p>If not even the powerful Wild Gods could resist the Light of Adjudication, then he most likely wouldn't escape from being purified as well.</p>

  <p>"But how did you, members of the Warden race, end up here?" he asked Zelda with a frown. The Warden race, just as its name implied, was supposed to manage this huge prison.</p>

  <p>Both Zelda and her brother, however, were extremely weak.</p>

  <p>It simply didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>"Because we chose to betray our race," she answered.</p>

  <p>Since the Warden race had existed for a long time, they had a colorful history.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God had created them and they inherited the huge prison and managed it. Moreover, they had to ensure the smooth operation of the Curse Chain and the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>All the races, with few exceptions, eventually doubted their own actions over the endless years.</p>

  <p>After all, the Warden race managing the prison also meant that they were trapped inside it just like the exiles.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God had also realized this problem. From time to time, he used his strong will to order the Warden race to do their duty.</p>

  <p>Under the will of the Chaos Ancient God, the Warden race had to follow the order to guard the prison dutifully from generation to generation.</p>

  <p>Eighty billion years ago, however, the Chaos Ancient God's will had disappeared after the corpse fell.</p>

  <p>"Could it be that the owner of the corpse was the one who built the prison?" asked Luo Zheng. "No, it's not like that.</p>

  <p>The elders of our Warden race assumed that the dead Chaos Ancient God might be a rival of our master, and our master might have been seriously injured, so he has no time to use his will," Zelda explained.</p>

  <p>Still, it didn't matter if that was true or false.</p>

  <p>Since the will of the Chaos Ancient God disappeared, the people of the Warden race had expressed different opinions. Eventually, they split into two factions: the conservative faction and the free faction.</p>

  <p>The conservative faction still followed the will of the Chaos Ancient God and continued to run the prison.</p>

  <p>The free faction, however, was tired of such endless days of duty and hoped to leave.</p>

  <p>The conservative faction accused the free faction of betraying the Chaos Ancient God, while the free faction vowed to find a way out of the prison.</p>

  <p>The two factions had secretly been in a fight for a long time and had exhausted almost all ways to beat the other.</p>

  <p>"Did the members of the free faction lose everything in the end?" Luo Zheng asked again. "Yes," said Zelda as her eyes fell on Luther and a somber smile danced across her face.</p>

  <p>"We're the last members of the free faction. I'm afraid we'll no longer exist in three years," she added.</p>

  <p>The Warden race had always lived in a special place where they could avoid the purification of the Light of Adjudication. Once they left that place, the Light of Adjudication would purify them and they would die, just like the other races.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh at Zelda's words. He didn't expect that she and her brother would've come from such a background.</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment and then said, "Wait. Since you're planning to leave this world, why don't you ask the powerful clans and forces in the bone towers for help?"</p>

  <p>It was already established that the free faction's goal was to leave the prison.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the masters of the powerful forces and clans in the bone towers were also exiled in the same place.</p>

  <p>They, too, wanted to escape from the prison.</p>

  <p>If they both joined forces, then they would have no reason to lose to the conservative faction.</p>

  <p>"Although we want to leave this prison, we don't want to conspire with those exiles. It is the legacy of the elders of our faction," Zelda said determinedly.</p>

  <p>The people of the Warden race were the guards who were responsible for watching over the prison.</p>

  <p>The exiles were the prisoners. Even if the guards wanted to escape from the prison, they wouldn't cooperate with the prisoners.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng could understand the free faction's reasons.</p>

  <p>"Our elders regretted in the last moment, but it was too late," Zelda said.</p>

  <p>Her mood suddenly turned sour and her eyes were filled with resentment as she continued, "The free faction was almost annihilated. I escaped first, and then Luther also got away."</p>

  <p>After they escaped, they hid themselves in the Iron Tribe.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to join those exiles?" Luo Zheng asked. "Of course I am,"</p>

  <p>Zelda said and she burned with strong hatred.</p>

  <p>"For me, it doesn't matter anymore whether I can leave this damn place or not! I want revenge!" she roared.</p>

  <p>Her bitterness came from the fact that their parents and the elders of the major clans were all killed.</p>

  <p>"But the conservative faction has long set up an escape-proof net. We can't break it at all with our current strength," Luther said calmly. Once again, he looked too wise for his young age.</p>

  <p>Luther couldn't become a Wild God, while Zelda's strength was weak.</p>

  <p>Although she had been cultivating hard, there were too few resources.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, her cultivation level increased rather slowly because she didn't dare to enter the cities.</p>

  <p>Now, the conservative faction only needed to ensure that the two of them couldn't enter any bone tower.</p>

  <p>Three years later, all the creatures outside the bone towers would be purified except the exiles in the bone towers. Zelda and Luther undoubtedly wouldn't be able to escape either, so there was no need to worry about the future.</p>

  <p>"I see. You want me to enter a bone tower and join the exiles inside?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I don't know where you're from, but you're bound by the Curse Chain. No matter how outstanding your talent or cultivation level is, you won't be able to escape the prison. I believe you'll make the right choice," Zelda encouraged.</p>

  <p>"But it seems that I have no choice," Luo Zheng sighed and smiled tiredly.</p>

  <p>Zelda burst into laughter as well at his words.</p>

  <p>The two siblings had stayed in the Iron Tribe for a very long time and were very careful not to cause any trouble.</p>

  <p>This time, however, they were determined to go all out.</p>

  <p>So they revealed almost all of their secrets to Luo Zheng, a young man from nowhere.</p>

  <p>Then again, they had no choice. This was their last chance. As for Luo Zheng, he had truly won their trust with his performance.</p>
