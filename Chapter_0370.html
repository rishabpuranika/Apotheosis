<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 370 Tianming (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While they were talking, eighteen warriors came into the arena to compete. But in this round, there was no disciple from the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, all the spectators started cheering loudly as they saw a person step into the arena.</p>

  <p>The man they were encouraging was clad in a white robe. It was not the kind of white robe the outer disciples usually wore. It was made of silk and the man had a noble Mu Ning, carrying a Cyan-blade Sword on his back.</p>

  <p>"It's Tianming from the Skytop Peak!" People were surprised to see him so early. With his powers, they had expected him to show up much later in the competition.</p>

  <p>"No matter how strong Tianming is, he is not a personal disciple. He still needs to start from the earlier stages of competition."</p>

  <p>"Just keep watching. We'll benefit from watching the fight between those strong contestants. It's also a good way to improve ourselves as we can learn a lot about martial art skills from them."</p>

  <p>The appearance of Hua Tianming had given rise to much discussion.</p>

  <p>"Tianming..." Luo Zheng shook his head. He knew nothing about this man. It looked like this man was very famous in the Cloud Sect. But whatever his fame or popularity, Luo Zheng had never heard of him. He was thinking that if he didn't know about this man, it would imply that he was ignorant.</p>

  <p>When it came to the master hands in the Skytop Peak, Luo Zheng only knew Lenard Zhu. The real strength of the Skytop Peak could never be underestimated. Lenard was not the top disciple of the Skytop Peak, but he had the kind of strength which had enabled him to confront a demon general. Hua Tianming, on the other hand, whilst standing in the arena, had a commanding manner in his every movement, which put Luo Zheng on high alert.</p>

  <p>However, there was no visible reaction on Zheng's face, seeing which, Master Wen explained to him, "Tianming is from a humble origin. But he has special talents, which have rarely been seen for the past five centuries or so. He has reached the consummation of nature level at the age of eighteen. Furthermore, he grasps the sword intent more deeply than anyone else, and once, successfully broke a record which had been set by a master from the Illuminating Soul Realm. If you encounter him in the arena, you'd better give up."</p>

  <p>As Yehudi had been defeated rather badly, Master Wen was greatly discouraged. From his point of view, all his hopes were pinned on Luo Zheng but the chances of winning the competition were extremely thin.</p>

  <p>Tianming was a swordsman of the finest degree. Anyone who came to fight with him risked losing their lives as they were sure to be as easily killed by his sword as a chicken. The greater threat was that they couldn't resist and death would find them swiftly. No superficial injuries, or minor wounds; just a single, deathly blow and Tianming was done with you.</p>

  <p>"I see, Master Wen." Despite saying so, Luo Zheng smiled. He knew that Master Wen was saying this with the good intention of protecting him from losing his life. But the good old master didn't know what was on Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>A large number of powerful masters had gathered in the All Peaks Competition. Some of them were so powerful that Luo Zheng wasn't one hundred percent sure that he could beat them. However, since he had participated in the competition, he would do his best to move forward and would not stop until his last breath.</p>

  <p>So when he saw Tianming's real strength, his heart trembled strongly. But not out of fear, no! It was the tremble of excitement that he could hardly control.</p>

  <p>In the face of deafening cheers from the crowd, Tianming stood in the center of the arena.</p>

  <p>His opponent was Damion Zhuge from the Skywrath Peak, another contestant at consummation of nature level.</p>

  <p>Compared to Fren, Damion was a mild and calm person. Powerful as he was, he was not as famous as Fren.</p>

  <p>So while facing his opponent Tianming, he acted very cautiously. He took out his sword and coldly asked his opponent, "Tianming, come on! Show me your sword!"</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and smiled lightly, having no intention to take out his sword. "Huh! Show my sword to You? I don't need a sword to fight you."</p>

  <p>Tianming was going to fight this man with his bare hands!</p>

  <p>Damion gnashed his teeth. As a member of the Zhuge Clan, and a top disciple of the Skywrath Peak, he hadn't expected that Tianming would be so arrogant and confident that he would beat him without a sword.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to use a sword? Then I will make you use one!" As soon as he finished his words, Damion lifted his sword and rushed towards Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Triple Swords of Absolute Annihilation!"</p>

  <p>The sword techniques that Damion had practiced could emanate prodigious power. Moreover, he knew that his opponent was not easy to deal with. So he employed his strongest skill first. There were only three movements in the Triple Swords of Absolute Annihilation, but its power became stronger with the advance of its movements.</p>

  <p>Facing Damion's unique skill, Tianming suddenly moved. His technique was unfathomable. It looked as if he was standing there motionlessly, but in reality, he was actually rushing straight towards Damion. At the very moment he reached Damion, he suddenly stretched out two fingers towards him and pressed them on the handle of Damion's sword.</p>

  <p>A clinking sound was heard, loud and clear even over the hubbub and cheers of the crowd.</p>

  <p>The ferocity and speed of this attack was such that Damion didn't even realize what had happened. Tianming had used only two of his fingers to gently tap on the handle of Damion's sword, and then it had dropped on the ground.</p>

  <p>Within a second of this move, Tianming's fingers immediately pointed themselves at Damion's forehead.</p>

  <p>Damion stood still when he realized what was going on. Given that Tianming was able to shoot his sword down with the intent of just two of his fingers, Damion had no doubt that the same two fingers could as easily blow up his head.</p>

  <p>"I... I surrender..."</p>

  <p>The gap between their real strength was too immense. And it was useless for Damion to continue the fight. So he surrendered without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Tianming turned around and left without even taking a look at Damion.</p>

  <p>The judge who was monitoring the round was also stupefied. It was not until Tianming had stepped out of the arena that he remembered that he had to announce the result. "Tianming won and Damion lost."</p>

  <p>The crowds cheered with loud applause.</p>

  <p>While his excellence compared to all the other disciples of the Cloud Sect was yet to be decided, one thing was for sure; Tianming was undoubtedly the most popular disciple in the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The popularity was largely attributed to his humble origins. From an anonymous boy to a powerful man who reached such a high level that he had broken the record set by a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm, his story was legend everywhere and contributed to his fame deeply.</p>

  <p>The competition continued in the arena.</p>

  <p>The group fights were supposed to eliminate three-fourths of the disciples. Every disciple had to fight at least two or three rounds. This was a long and tiring process.</p>

  <p>Later, another three disciples of the Drizzle Peak entered the arena to contest in the rounds. But it seemed that their overall performance was not so encouraging. Except for Luo Zheng who won in the second round, all the other disciples ended in failure.</p>

  <p>When it came to the eighth round, it was Zheng's turn to fight again.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng of the Drizzle Peak Vs York of the Sea Peak!"</p>

  <p>The judge's voice came loud and clear. Master Wang from the Sea Peak suddenly laughed upon hearing this while Master Wen's face darkened.</p>

  <p>York was in the good graces of Master Wang. Master Wen obviously sensed that York was a seeded player of the Sea Peak and his strength should not be underestimated. The Sea Peak had stayed silent in the past few years. They were actually accumulating their strength and lying in wait to surprise everyone in the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng Vs York, God bless Luo Zheng!</p>
