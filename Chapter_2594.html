  <p>
</p>

  <p>Usually, when a warrior used his soul to suppress his opponent, his soul would need to be much stronger than his opponent's.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had stepped into this world, he discovered that the Wild Gods in this world rarely spent any time cultivating their souls.</p>

  <p>Although the warrior's soul would naturally become strengthened over time, it was a lengthy process.</p>

  <p>For example, since Giacomo, Adele, and the other elders of the Nine Li race, who had lived and battled all of their lives, had no increased cultivation on their souls, their souls, being inferior, could not measure up to Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Today, Zheng hadn't planned on using his own soul power, as he could handle his opponents without resorting to this step.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect that David would first resort to this method.</p>

  <p>The latter was still emboldened and full of himself.</p>

  <p>David believed that he would never lose in a soul battle against any of his peers.</p>

  <p>Moreover, his master had gifted him with a Soul Ring. The Soul Ring not only protected his soul, but also strengthened his soul force, bolstering his potential. The Soul Ring was a precious soul weapon. If a ring bearer's opponent didn't possess a strong enough soul, he could crush that opponent with the Soul Ring.</p>

  <p>"I'll shred your soul!" he shouted with a ferocious look gleaming in his eyes.</p>

  <p>David had never before suffered such a devastating loss. Now he wanted to use this opportunity to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>That soul pressure instantly attacked Zheng's mind and went straight for his soul with a murderous intent.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul quietly floated in his mind, and a smile crept onto his face when he saw David's soul pressure launching at him.</p>

  <p>After his soul had been integrated with the Shadow Bearing Sword, Zheng no longer needed to fear even the soul of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The strength of David's soul was only at a level where he had barely touched the True God Soul. The gap between him and Zheng was substantial. Moreover, the battle between souls was very similar to a physical battle. It was a competition of strength. If one's soul was strong, he was strong; otherwise, he was weak with a weak soul power. There were no coincidences.</p>

  <p>As soon as David's soul attack encircled Zheng's soul, it began to bite and claw crazily at Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>In less than one second, David was left stunned.</p>

  <p>His soul attack had not caused any harm to Zheng. At the same time, he felt how the surface of Zheng's soul began to twist as many glittering small golden arrows materialized.</p>

  <p>Waves upon rippling waves of sharpened soul force was being emitted.</p>

  <p>At this point, a look of horror finally appeared on David's face.</p>

  <p>'How could this be?'</p>

  <p>He had planned to deal with Zheng within two steps� he would first distract Zheng's mind with his soul attack, and then finish him with an attack on his physical body.</p>

  <p>But when the first step was barely initiated, he was left dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was utterly unshakable!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>David reacted with the speed of panic. He immediately withdrew his soul force from Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Yet, the moment he pulled back, Zheng's face cracked into a smile.</p>

  <p>"If you intend to humiliate yourself, I will help you," Zheng said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>An invisible soul pressure stretched forth from Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>The soul pressure was frightening in its scope, and it rushed straight to David's mind.</p>

  <p>These waves were a myriad of soul arrows that crashed onto David's brain, directly flooding to his soul.</p>

  <p>David was now in a state of utter stupefaction. He had no idea how to counter Zheng's soul attack.</p>

  <p>However, as the soul arrows were about to penetrate David's soul, the Soul Ring over his head suddenly pulsed forth a circle of golden light that arched over David, firmly protecting him.</p>

  <p>The sounds of clicking rang out as the arrows struck the golden light like a hail storm.</p>

  <p>Countless soul arrows then altered their course, shooting up towards the Soul Ring.</p>

  <p>Under the dizzying assault, the Soul Ring over David's head rapidly dimmed, and a visible crack quickly spread over its golden surface.</p>

  <p>Once the Soul Ring was destroyed, David's soul would be left vulnerable, and the arrows would riddle through him like a sieve.</p>

  <p>However, as the Soul Ring was being attacked, tens of millions of miles away from there, a middle-aged man's eyes snapped open.</p>

  <p>He was sitting in meditation inside the Pyramid Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>The Pyramid Bone Tower was the place of the Yellow Emperor race where they congregated for meetings.</p>

  <p>This middle-aged man was David's master. He was one of the exiles who had created the Yellow Emperor race, the Yellow Emperor Guard, Tyler Di.</p>

  <p>Usually, these exiles kept themselves aloof and would not meddle in these minor fights and squabbles.</p>

  <p>Even should the members of the Yellow Emperor race be slaughtered, the exiles wouldn't be bothered as long as the enemy didn't come knocking at the bone tower.</p>

  <p>Only if one race went too far and gained access to their opponent's bone tower, would these powerful exiles then make a move.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race had once entered the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, but as a result, many of their Wild Gods were slaughtered by the Nine Li race. However, the exiles of the Yellow Emperor race didn't take revenge then. After all, it had been their race who broke the rule first.</p>

  <p>Disputes among the various great races were exclusively limited to the Wild Gods, and did not involve the exiles. This was an unwritten rule as old as this very world.</p>

  <p>The Soul Ring Tyler Di had given to David had been made of a part of his soul.</p>

  <p>Even though it was a mere wisp of his soul, the Soul Ring could resist any soul attack from the Wild Gods of this world as their souls were too weak.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Tyler Di unexpectedly realized that the Soul Ring was being attacked violently.</p>

  <p>He might not have taken the attack seriously, but how could the Soul Ring not successfully block it?</p>

  <p>If the Soul Ring failed and exploded, David's soul would in all likelihood be destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Who is this attacker? Whose soul attack could be so powerful?" Tyler murmured in surprise.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Yellow Emperor race had set their sights on the Sky South Bone Tower and had a battle with the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>It was Tyler Di's intention to take over lordship of the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>Although the Sky South Bone Tower wasn't large or significant, once they occupied this place, it could become an important outpost position for the Yellow Emperor race and open the door to further expansion.</p>

  <p>Also, Lancelot had informed him that the Nine Li race had agreed to their challenge.</p>

  <p>Tyler Di had been quite confident in David's strength. In his opinion, David was capable of winning the fight alone, if he went into battle, they could then claim the Sky South Bone Tower from their opponents.</p>

  <p>How then was David's soul suddenly being suppressed by someone?</p>

  <p>'Who is that guy?' Tyler Di wondered, his eyes flashing with shock as he realized an unknown entity had entered the game.</p>

  <p>With a gentle flick of his hand, a space projection appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Tyler Di, who had mainly cultivated the Truth of Void Destruction, had mastered an amazing control of space. He had become a legend for his skills among the Yellow Emperor Guards!</p>

  <p>"Who is he? How has he cultivated his soul to such consummation at such a young age? No... He hasn't yet. Yet he has merged with the soul of a legendary weapon. Is it the Truth of Goodwill and Malice?" Noticing something strange reflected under Zheng's soul pressure, Tyler Di became curious about him.</p>

  <p>There were a limited number of people who had successfully cultivated the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>Those aged exiles of the Nine Li race had been secluded for eons, and there were quite a few disputes between the two races. Therefore Tyler Di knew much about the exiles of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>None of them had ever cultivated the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>How did this man then cultivate this method, and to such a level of proficiency?</p>

  <p>However, now was not the right time to spend his time contemplating this mystery. If he did not intervene in this matter, David would be vanquished today.</p>

  <p>He had invested such deep hopes in David, and he couldn't bear those hopes being ruined so easily.</p>

  <p>With a focused thought, he moved across a gap of thousands and thousands of miles and stood at the top of the Flying Sickle City.</p>
