<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 762 Five-star Divine Texture (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Along with the preparations and countermeasures they were doing, the Cloud Hall was also doing its best on closely monitoring Eddie's movements. According to the information the Cloud Hall had gathered from their latest discussion, Eddie seemed to be looking for a way to recover Eden's warrior spirit after leaving the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>All cultivators across the land knew the consequences of losing their warrior spirit; it was a devastating event that they all dreaded to think about.</p>

  <p>As those who had witnessed such an incident could attest to, not only would the warrior never be able to recover from such a blow, there was also a high possibility that the warrior would even lose all confidence to continue living in this world.</p>

  <p>Recovering the warrior spirit of a cultivator was definitely a difficult feat.</p>

  <p>This was due to the fact that even if they had somehow repaired it, there would still be burdensome side effects that could affect the warrior. An example of this would be the likelihood of developing amnesia.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the mind of the cultivator might even be damaged. Another condition for the warriors who had lost their warrior spirits would be the dependence on other people. This was because if they were left unattended or uncared for, it would be significantly harder for them to recover with the passing of time. As the warriors often felt deeper about their sufferings and pitied their conditions, falling into depression worsened their state of mind.</p>

  <p>That was the most probable reason as to why Eddie did not immediately seek vengeance and stomp through the Cloud Hall. The man had prioritized the finding and restoration of Eden's warrior spirit first.</p>

  <p>This news might have been the only relatively good news for the people of Cloud Hall. At the very least, it had helped them buy quite a bit of time.</p>

  <p>Before they had even noticed, half a month had already passed. With their days spent anxiously moving around their sects and occasionally looking towards the sky in case their opponent had decided to make a move, time passed by with relative ease. On the nineteenth day, a total of four thousand and nine hundred divine textures were finally completed. With that, what remained was the last three five-star divine textures, also the most crucial ones out of them all.</p>

  <p>The impending three five-star divine textures cost four thousand supreme life vitality crystals--and that was only for the materials. Additionally, they were also the most critical divine textures in the sect-protecting array. All the over four thousand divine textures of the sect-protecting array would be able to work on the premise that these three five-star divine textures were put into place.</p>

  <p>The three were significant and valuable in their own ways. The first five-star divine texture was named "Light of Water." This was due to the fact that this particular divine texture was able to gather the power of fourteen hundred divine textures and was capable of condensing them into a sect-protecting enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Just as the first one had been of utmost importance, the second five-star divine texture termed the "Wrath of Thunder" was also revered for a different way. The particular divine texture focused on bringing offensive powers, one that could unleash an attack similar to thunder tribulation.</p>

  <p>Last but definitely not the least was the third five-star divine texture known as "Mad Trap". The divine texture served as a trap that would only be activated at the opponent's trigger.</p>

  <p>These three five-star divine textures were not created by Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>Although the young cultivator was confident that he would be able to complete these three divine textures, the materials needed to produce them were just too precious and scarce. Even the smallest mistake or a slip of hand could make all his efforts go to waste.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the problem was not the fact that the Cloud Hall could not afford the life vitality crystals themselves. Rather, it was more of the actuality that some materials needed were not available to acquire within a short period of time even if they had the resources to purchase them. Now that they were faced with a formidable and powerful foe, Luo Luo Zheng was not willing to take any risks to lose.</p>

  <p>Placed in front of Luo Luo Zheng was a huge piece of parchment that could be used for drawing runes. Picking up the wooden brush and gripping it lightly, he let a trace of the cyan dragon's soul infuse into the brush in preparation of what he was about to do. Without hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng positioned the tip of the brush on top of the paper and as it touched the surface, a bright beam of light streamed out which had contained strong power of the Water Law.</p>

  <p>Divine textures that ranged from one to four stars did not have a high requirement for the Law Power as it did not need much to be produced.</p>

  <p>However, the process of drawing the five-star divine texture necessitated the individual to be proficient in the Law Power. An exhibition of this would be the "Light of Water", as one had to be adept in the first layer of the Water Law power, otherwise, it would basically be impossible to finish it.</p>

  <p>For instance, there were some divine texture experts in the Upper World that were able to successfully cultivate the Fire Law and Thunder Law with their own capabilities, but some were not able to draw the "Light of Water".</p>

  <p>This was due to the fact that being able to activate the properties of the materials in the ink came hand in hand with having a complete comprehension and command of the Water Law.</p>

  <p>While closely inspecting the radiant beam of light that rippled like water on Luo Zheng's brush tip, Felix gasped in surprise at the sight.</p>

  <p>The man could also draw five-star runes with ease, however, what he was currently seeing was something extraordinary. 'Why does drawing a five-star rune need such a strong Law Power?' he wondered, especially amazed at the handiwork Luo Luo Zheng was doing on the parchment. With curiosity and anticipation apparent on the way he gazed at Luo Zheng's hand as it gracefully danced atop the paper while holding the brush, he contemplated that Luo Luo Zheng was indeed special, 'Is this guy sure that he is drawing a five-star rune, and not a six-star or seven-star rune?'</p>

  <p>"How strong will the power of this rune be once it is activated?!" The man sitting beside Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed as he could not help but feel expectant of the results.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, the highest level a rune could be was six-star.</p>

  <p>Moreover, only a few old men in the Runic Tower in the whole wide world could manage to summon enough power to make it. However, none of them would employ such potent Law Power!</p>

  <p>This was also the exact reason which made divine textures extremely powerful. If one had to compare it with the runes, the power of a singular five-star divine texture could be equivalent to an eight-star rune in the Central Region. In the end, it was the motivation Luo Luo Zheng needed, as he was confident in making the sect-protecting array to be able to completely resist Eddie and his powers.</p>

  <p>The brush strokes of the runes exuded the kind of aesthetically pleasing visual that calmed Luo Luo Zheng and Felix as they were akin to tiny streams of water that flowed with radiant splendor. As the lines gracefully intertwined with each other, it depicted such a beautifully complex piece that reflected the wishes of the one drawing them.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Luo Zheng a couple of hours before finally finishing the drawing of the "Light of Water". As he finally perfected the last stroke of his brush, he lifted the pen from the parchment and could not help but feel a sense of satisfaction and relief at seeing his complete drawing. The young man smiled a little to himself while he stretched the hand he had been working with; it had been a tedious four hours of being hunched over his worktable.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The people roaming in the hall emitted sounds of surprise and delight as they heard the melodious sound of flowing water that surrounded them. It had seemed like the divine texture which could be compared to a skillfully done landscape painting had sprung to life. The picture radiated a soft and gentle sensation as it gave the impressions of a salty breeze by the seaside and the welcoming mellow waves.</p>

  <p>After the liquid-like ripples on the runes gradually subsided, the Mu Ning emitted by the Water Law slowly disappeared and it left behind the plain expanse of the rune. Without the unobtrusive sounds of water, the place had become quiet again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at Felix who appeared to still be fascinated by the brief showcase of the rune's power and then nudged him into reality. "I am ready to do the next one." Luo Luo Zheng nodded at him and calmly stated.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, their ears picked up on a ruckus from the entrance of the hall. Both men looked questioningly at each other at the same time, wondering what the commotion was all about.</p>

  <p>"For the past few days, Ning Yudie has announced that she's in closed-door cultivation. Well, I think that's only an excuse! She's just trying to hide and avoid facing the problem as it is," one of the people loudly protested. "The Cloud Hall is on the verge of collapsing. How could she hide in her mighty Ice Palace all alone and refuse to come out?" a high pitched voice complained outside before continuing, "She's being irresponsible!"</p>

  <p>"She must give us an explanation!"</p>

  <p>"I heard that Luo Luo Zheng was drawing some useless runes here. It's just a sect-protecting array. What can it do, anyway?! Either capture that bastard and hand him over or force Ning Yudie out!" more of them demanded angrily, as they started to come closer to where Luo Luo Zheng was working.</p>

  <p>The loud cacophony of voices which had started far away came nearer by the minute and it was not long before a group of dissenting people appeared at the entrance. This was not good as Luo Luo Zheng might not be able to focus with all his might.</p>

  <p>The face of Luo Zheng's companion turned red with anger at the sudden intrusion of the mob forming outside. Moreover, he had looked downright murderous at the thought of people about to barge inside and interrupt Luo Zheng's process of drawing the runes. It was the most crucial moment for Luo Luo Zheng to finish the sect-protecting array and yet the bumbling idiots raging at the entrance did not understand the severity of the situation.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is the noise about?!" The normally good-tempered Felix could not help but bellow in wrath as he wished to stop the fools from causing more disturbance than they already did.</p>
