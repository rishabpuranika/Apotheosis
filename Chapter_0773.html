<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 773 The Suppressive Force (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Nine balls of light floated around Mist's celestial tomb, the luminous glow growing brighter as warriors emerged from each of the other eight balls as well.</p>

  <p>The majority of them came from the Central Region, further grounding rampant speculations that the enchanted lamps would eventually fall into the hands of the large sects.</p>

  <p>It was not a particular bitter fact to swallow for the small clans and sects.</p>

  <p>The lamps had no use for people of weak strength, knowing that the top masters from the Central Region would only end up annihilating them in a fight for the fortunes in Mist's celestial tomb. It would have been a plea for their own deaths if they dared to hope for a chance to win against the impenetrable force. They had to make the wiser choice of bargaining the items with the larger sects in exchange for more substantial benefits.</p>

  <p>The event this time had the nine powers entering Mist's celestial tomb. The Cloud Hall, World Commercial Alliance, Bloodwood Cliff, Mysterious Luna Hall and Black Mountain Sect had gathered at the place with some independent warriors who had led secluded lives, a select few being masters of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>They made up an overwhelming number of warriors coming from the Central Region, all with an exception of one group.</p>

  <p>This unorthodox team traveled far to get to the destination through the space channel. However, their entrance was not seen by the people of the Central Region, who had entered the path to the tomb long before their arrival.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Is this Mist's celestial tomb?"</p>

  <p>Stumbling out of the portal, a woman dressed in black garbs looked around in wonder and confusion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is!" A laugh was heard from the handsome man materializing after his companion. He stood proudly, his moderate build straightened in posture while he looked around.</p>

  <p>She frowned, her bafflement only running deeper, "Didn't you say that we could only enter when all the lamps light up at the same time? Why isn't anyone else here?"</p>

  <p>At the question, he furrowed his eyebrows before appraising their venue a second time in a perplexed manner, "There are nine lamps for the celestial tomb, maybe there are different entrances for each." A pause was felt as they pondered over his answer, a lingering curiosity permeating the air. He huffed shortly after and crossed his arms, his stare landing on the track they were to trek. "Anyway, it doesn't matter. As far as I know, the other eight lamps are all from the Sky Northern Region, and those ants mean nothing to us. We just need to focus on what we came here for."</p>

  <p>The words struck to the girl's mind and immediately brought a fierce look to paint her expression, her dark clothes highlighting the shadows of determination captured in her look. "You're right, I don't want anything like bones of the immortal or the Flower of Life and Death. I only want one thing, and I will kill whoever stands in my way!"</p>

  <p>With a wicked smile, her partner ominously chucked and said, "They're quite daring to have the guts to oppose you, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>Sneering, she turned away and marched towards the opening. She did not bother thinking or caring about the possible danger lying ahead of them as she strode confidently. Her comrade followed her closely behind, wordlessly shifting to match her serious mood.</p>

  <p>The pair had come from the four great divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The Central Region in which Luo Zheng resided was known as the Sky Northern Region to the four divine kingdoms, with some people referring to it as the Sky Northern Island due to their prejudice for the land.</p>

  <p>Even though its area and surrounding regions had vastly expanded to a size that was near unimaginable, the four divine kingdoms had still not changed their mindset of the land being much poorer compared to their home.</p>

  <p>Two thousand years ago, the handsome man's family happened to take the enchanted lamp of the celestial tomb as one of their possessions. They had kept it secret for two thousand years, keeping every information hidden and quickly diffusing any rumors that might have once erupted. They were afraid that the masters from the four divine kingdoms would hear of it and forcefully take it to enter Mist's celestial tomb to hunt the treasures.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the forces in the Sky Northern Region had always been considered invisible to their clan.</p>

  <p>Steeling herself at the recollection, she fearlessly trudged up the rest of the trail. She was a master of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, along with her accomplice. Yet, they were not foolish enough to venture out alone. They had brought with them several Life and Death Realm masters whose mission was to solely guard them both.</p>

  <p>They marched, entering the passageway of the cave before they suddenly halted, "What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Frowning, she glanced at her ally, searching for a response but the man merely noted the strange atmosphere with the same puzzlement and alarm,</p>

  <p>"What a strong suppressive force! I'm being completely shut off!"</p>

  <p>The group exchanged stares. One of the guards shared the thoughts of the others, "I also felt it. This suppressive force appears to be triggered by some powerful array, it's too hard to resist!" Murmurs of shock and perturbation sliced through, building tension as the pressure of the superior power suffocated their own.</p>

  <p>No one was left unaffected by its oppression, all the warriors were stuck in experiencing the slow panic welling up from inside of them from the uncertainty of the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the warriors at the Life and Death Realm, Virtual Tribulation Realm or the Internal Elixir Realm, no one could quell the dominating Mu Ning forcing them to submissiveness.</p>

  <p>Bits of ice crystals flickered between Yudie's slim fingers, testing out her own abilities with a look of frustration spoiling her features. "My cultivation base has been suppressed by a whole realm, I can only wield strength at the medium stage of Internal Elixir Realm."</p>

  <p>It was too much of a damage; she was originally at the medium stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but now, she was back at the Internal Elixir Realm. She clenched her fist as the inklings of fear started to manifest through the tremors shaking her slim body. She looked at the rest, sending a mute question of whether they were going through the same experience.</p>

  <p>She was decidedly not alone, judging by the distress the horde exhibited.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Virtual Tribulation Realm such as Fernandez were also doomed to showcase their prowess at a level of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>
