  <p>
</p>

  <p>Amber and the world lords from Prison Island were also watching this scene unfold from the other side of the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>Only Prison Island's guards, Fannie and Sammy had fought with Luo Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>Fannie and Sammy finally understood now why they weren't able to shake Luo Luo Zheng in the slightest, forget defeating him, even when they used their full strength. They had definitely underestimated his strength?</p>

  <p>As for Amber, she was abnormally calm in this situation.</p>

  <p>This youth who had killed his way around the Sea God Continent was already on par with a Supreme Lord in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow was extremely excited right now.</p>

  <p>He had suffered a great loss just now due to his carelessness.</p>

  <p>Ambushing and assassinating people from the back was his forte. He had never in his wildest dreams expected Luo Luo Zheng to predict his move and counterattack first!</p>

  <p>As a result, Supreme Lord Shadow was pretty much defenseless against Luo Zheng's counterattack.</p>

  <p>It would have been fine if it was an ordinary counterattack, but Supreme Lord Shadow was overwhelmed with the power that Luo Luo Zheng had unleashed at this moment. The seemingly casual strike contained enough power to cause his internal organs to be damaged as it surged through him. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>It was a humiliating defeat for someone of this stature!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow was baffled with this turn of events. What method had Luo Luo Zheng used? How did he know beforehand that he would attack him from behind?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow's Heavenly Destiny was Shadow Dance. If he hid himself, in theory, no one would be able to find him in the universe. In some sense, this Heavenly Destiny wasn't so impressive, but it could prove to be very lethal. He could sneakily approach anyone. Even a Supreme Lord would worry about being assassinated!</p>

  <p>He naturally did not know that everything within the range of the will of worlds was transparent to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, when Luo Luo Zheng and Leroy were facing Faith Trial, he was already aware of the existence of Supreme Lord Korbin and Supreme Lord Shadow. Luo Luo Zheng would have not taken any action if those Supreme Lords had chosen to leave him be. However, now that they had started the battle, he would not be lenient! Every strike he made was resolute and forceful.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow reached out to feel the trace of blood on the corner of his mouth. His eyes were like poisonous scorpions as they bore into Luo Luo Zheng. "How did you know?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned around and asked, "Why should I tell you?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't, you're dead for sure!" Supreme Lord Shadow threatened.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's smile grew wider. "Are you trying to tell me that you will spare my life if I tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Hah! In your dreams!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow lost his patience at this point.</p>

  <p>Fighting with a world-lord-level kid would be a waste of time. Now that he had been humiliated, he just wanted to kill Luo Luo Zheng as soon as possible!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow suddenly split into two black shadows, vanishing on the spot!</p>

  <p>He was about to execute a second assassination?</p>

  <p>Leroy's reaction was also extremely quick. He was greatly surprised by Luo Zheng's performance, but at the same time he was also relieved. At least this sudden turn of events wasn't as troublesome as he had imagined. He still had a chance!</p>

  <p>If he could quickly finish off Supreme Lord Korbin, he might even be able to help Luo Luo Zheng kill Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With a raise of his hand, three rays of black light shot out from him in a flash!</p>

  <p>"Fixed Vision token!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's eyes shone with a golden light as he stared at Supreme Lord Korbin, who was near him. These three Sun-extinguishing Arrows would definitely kill his foe, for there was no way to dodge or obstruct them!</p>

  <p>Just like Supreme Lord Leroy, Supreme Lord Korbin also belonged to the Demon Night. He knew all about Leroy's Fixed Vision token. He also knew he couldn't evade it, and he never thought of dodging it!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Cyan flames burned brightly in his body ?</p>

  <p>Then, three Sun-extinguishing Arrows pierced through Supreme Lord Korbin's body.</p>

  <p>As the cyan flames slowly extinguished, Supreme Lord Korbin also disappeared. Then, a searing heat suddenly rained down from the skies.</p>

  <p>All of the martial artists around the Inauguration Altar felt as if they were in a furnace as the scorching heat wave washed over them instantly!</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Board of Elders did not dare to remain there any longer!</p>

  <p>In a war between Supreme Lords, a single move was enough to destroy the world. At this moment, both sides were restraining themselves slightly, but if they really used their true abilities to the hilt, it was possible that the Rosy Cloud World would be torn apart!</p>

  <p>Amber's group also began to retreat. Obviously, no one wanted to get caught in the crossfire.</p>

  <p>However, the pilgrims under the Inauguration Altar did not budge...</p>

  <p>Most of the pilgrims were weak, and they wouldn't be able to escape fast enough. Furthermore, these pilgrims didn't want to leave this place, so they could only whine in low voices in the unique language of the Demon Night and pray for the queens' protection.</p>

  <p>However, that scorching heat became increasingly intense. Many of the Demon Night warriors' hair and brows began to curl up, and some people covered their faces and rolled onto the ground!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A fire wheel appeared in the sky. Supreme Lord Korbin stood on this wheel and descended towards Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>"Beacon Wheel!"</p>

  <p>The Beacon Wheel rolled forward, hurtling down straight towards Leroy.</p>

  <p>The heat emitted from the Beacon Wheel could melt the earth!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>As the heat was cast down and spread, the pilgrims under the Inauguration Altar were set on fire one by one, and turned into blazing flames ?</p>

  <p>It had to be said that these pilgrims were deeply devoted. Some of the distant ones had yet to be affected and seeing the brutal condition of the pilgrims in front of them, they did not scream or run away, but instead remained calm even in the face of death!</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>There was no change in Leroy's expression as he faced the Beacon Wheel.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin's attack was massive, but the threat it posed to a Supreme Lord was not much. The power of space behind him suddenly exploded outwards, and Leroy disappeared on the spot!</p>

  <p>Soon after, he appeared high up in the sky. The bow in his hand had been unfurled. He was holding onto the bowstring with all five fingers. With a sudden tug, a complex divine texture appeared between the bowstring and the bow!</p>

  <p>Buzz buzz ?</p>

  <p>As the divine texture vibrated, five different-colored arrows appeared attached to the bowstring!</p>

  <p>Gold, cyan, black, green and purple!</p>

  <p>Respectively, they were Scorching Sun Arrow, Sun-extinguishing Arrow, Profound Dividing Arrow, Spirit Stealing Arrow and Boundless Arrow!</p>

  <p>In the battle with the Supreme Lord, Leroy fought without any hesitation, and now he had used several of his moves at a time.</p>

  <p>However, he hadn't used the Blood-devouring Bone Arrows yet, the cost of which was too high. Unless it was a last resort, he didn't plan to use them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The five different-colored arrows rained down from top to bottom and instantly landed in front of Supreme Lord Korbin.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin's brows were knitted together slightly as he stood on the Beacon Wheel.</p>

  <p>Leroy's Fixed Vision token was very difficult to beat. It was an unreasonable Law of Causality that allowed one to determine a target.</p>

  <p>Since Leroy could see the target, the arrow he shot would definitely hit the mark.</p>

  <p>Korbin would have to use other methods to neutralize the attack. He probably even had to take it head-on, but he couldn't dodge it? even if he wanted to!</p>

  <p>The five long arrows were honing in on him, and were about to hit him.</p>

  <p>"Substitute Fire Emissary!"</p>

  <p>When the five long arrows pierced through Supreme Lord Korbin, he once again became a flaming human!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The fiery figure was hit by the five arrows with different attributes and was instantly shredded to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, not long after, the body of Supreme Lord Korbin reformed.</p>

  <p>The "Substitute Fire Emissary" was Supreme Lord Korbin's self-enlightened flame token. It had helped him to ward off disasters countless times!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin's plan was that once Supreme Lord Shadow took down Luo Luo Zheng, he could work together with him, and then dealing with Leroy would be a breeze. Thus, Korbin thought that Leroy should be the one to be most anxious right now, and not him!</p>

  <p>Clearly, the five arrows didn't work, so Leroy turned to Luo Luo Zheng, who was standing on the other side.</p>

  <p>He was worried. 'Supreme Lord Shadow appears and disappears like a ghost. Will Luo Luo Zheng be able to avoid getting assassinated?'</p>

  <p>The only thing that gave Leroy some comfort was that Luo Zheng's reflexes were astonishing. This kid had even broken through Leroy's Fixed Vision token.</p>

  <p>Leroy was puzzled by this, because breaking the Law of Causality was a violation of common sense.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had refused to tell him how he did it, but he had been trying to figure it out. In the end, he had only come up with one possibility: that Luo Luo Zheng might have a kind of token, which allowed him to see through people's soul. That was how he knew where he was going to shoot his arrow, and had snapped it into two so easily.</p>

  <p>If his guess was correct, then it would be very difficult for Supreme Lord Shadow to defeat Luo Luo Zheng ?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy had stopped fighting and Supreme Lord Korbin regarded Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still floating in the air, but he was turning in a certain direction.</p>

  <p>A mocking smile was plastered on his face as he stared into the void, giving no clue as to what he was going to do.</p>

  <p>After activating the Shadow Dance, it was theoretically impossible to detect Supreme Lord Shadow's location. With this Law of Causality, he could get close to anyone without being detected!</p>

  <p>But that kid Luo Luo Zheng was staring right at him!</p>

  <p>Looking at Luo Zheng's smiling face, Supreme Lord Shadow felt that he had been very foolish in his tactics. He had never felt so aggrieved before. It was as if he had swallowed a rat!</p>
