  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the Chaotic Source Spirits lost their power, the queen ant's defensive power dropped significantly.</p>

  <p>However, even without that added defense, the queen ant remained resilient.</p>

  <p>It continued to struggle in futility for its life, fighting to stand despite the sword that was deeply lodged through the side of its head.</p>

  <p>The three warriors from the Lofty Mountain race, the Moon Spirit race, and the Celestial Wolf race were overjoyed at the scene! Not willing to waste such a wonderful opportunity, the three of them quickly rushed towards the dying queen ant.</p>

  <p>Sally and Chaim were left in the dust as the three ran. The Lofty Mountain warrior even reached out in an attempt to tear the ant's belly.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng snorted as an unpleasant aura surrounded him.</p>

  <p>He was the one who killed the queen ant and there was no way he was going to let these three warriors get his spoils.</p>

  <p>The aura he released reached the three warriors and all of them quickly froze in their tracks. How could they continue on when Luo Zheng had obviously already staked his claim?</p>

  <p>If the young man had been able to kill the queen ant that was at the same level of strength as a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, what chance did the three of them have?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swooped down and pulled his long sword out of the queen ant's head while the three warriors quickly jumped to the side.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>A rather gruesome sound was heard as Luo Zheng lifted his sword and slashed the ant's belly open, revealing all the Chaotic Source Spirits and numerous ant eggs.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits escaped out of the split belly and into his hand one by one.</p>

  <p>The three warriors could only look on in longing as they counted the amount of Chaotic Source Spirits Luo Zheng gathered from this amazing feat.</p>

  <p>They knew the level they stood in wasn't very high and that they would have to make do with whatever amount Luo Zheng was willing to give them. Their only hope was that Luo Zheng harvested a lot of Chaotic Source Spirits, so the three of them could also expect a bit more for their share.</p>

  <p>After the ant's belly had been emptied out of all Chaotic Source Spirits, Luo Zheng found that he was able to get more than three hundred in total.</p>

  <p>There was only a limited amount of Chaotic Source Spirits one could refine.</p>

  <p>An ordinary creature would need about two hundred to undergo the complete Chaotic Source Reinforcement, which meant that the amount Luo Zheng had gotten from the ant's belly was more than enough.</p>

  <p>He didn't notice it but the eyes of the three warriors behind him burned with fury and determination. They couldn't help but think of the possibility of fighting Luo Zheng if the Chaotic Source Spirits weren't enough.</p>

  <p>Sally and Chaim, on the other hand, remained calm. Since they were Luo Zheng's fellow disciples in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he was bound to give some to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng already knew how he was going to split the Chaotic Source Spirits. He was going to take the lion's share, of course, but he was also definitely going to share with Sally and Chaim. As for those three warriors, he'd give them a few to keep them happy.</p>

  <p>At that moment though, two pairs of golden wings appeared on top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The hurricane had already stopped, and Brylee and Lesly now floated peacefully in the air.</p>

  <p>"We're in the right place. The warrior of the Lofty Mountain race hasn't moved and all of them are directly below us," Brylee said.</p>

  <p>Lesly closed her eyes, sensing the soul mark and nodding. "There are two people from the Bearing race currently rushing over along with one New Moon race's member and another from the Divine Farmer race. Should we wait for them?"</p>

  <p>They couldn't underestimate Luo Zheng's strength, so they had to be smart and gather as much manpower as they could before going for the kill.</p>

  <p>However, Brylee's arrogant smile said otherwise. "Are you scared of that guy?"</p>

  <p>All the demon women in the Divine Lair were powerful, but only a few were deemed qualified to be cultivated.</p>

  <p>The power of the Jin Wu's divine flames could suppress anything at the same level.</p>

  <p>There was no way they would be afraid of any opponent especially if they could fight together. Lesly huffed, "Fine, let's attack!"</p>

  <p>With her directive, the wings on their backs flashed golden light as the Jin Wu's divine flames burst forth.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Two circles of golden light appeared above their heads. They were the highly condensed divine flames of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>The two of them reached out, summoning pure, golden swords from the circles of golden light.</p>

  <p>Brylee pressed her index finger down. "Go!"</p>

  <p>Her voice made the golden swords shoot downwards, attacking anything below them.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Each sword's size was only that of a human palm, but the highly concentrated divine flames of the Jin Wu could burn almost anything.</p>

  <p>The mountain would have resisted this barrage of burning swords had there been more Chaotic Source Spirits around. Unfortunately, all had been eaten by the queen ant.</p>

  <p>As soon as the swords reached the mountain, it began to burn, even turning the rocks into magma!</p>

  <p>Inside the cave, Luo Zheng, who was just about to speak, suddenly felt a strong force emanate from above.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Even Chaim, Sally, and the other warriors also felt it.</p>

  <p>They all raised their heads, straining their eyes to see the top of the cave and found a golden rain of swords pouring down from the heavens.</p>

  <p>"Dodge!"</p>

  <p>Chaim shouted, responding quickly to the danger and retreating towards a corner of the cave.</p>

  <p>Sally also moved to seek shelter, but her path was unfortunately blocked by several golden swords.</p>

  <p>One even missed her by mere inches and the heat from it had been enough to burn her hair. She froze in fright and only moved out of the way when someone grabbed her arm and dragged her to the side.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>Of course, it was Luo Zheng. He did not just drag her away from harm but also protected her from the sword's flames by blocking it with his hand...</p>

  <p>The divine flames weren't enough to activate the Sanskrit words on his body. Golden spirals appeared on Luo Zheng's arm, completely snuffing out the flames on the sword.</p>

  <p>Sally remained in a daze, only snapping out of it when Luo Zheng began to speak.</p>

  <p>"This cave is going to collapse! Go to Chaim and stay there!"</p>

  <p>He immediately pushed her towards the corner and Sally found herself falling on her butt beside Chaim. Their spot was relatively secure and no flaming sword would be able to get them there.</p>

  <p>The three warriors, however, were a different story.</p>

  <p>All they wanted was their share of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Why did such a disaster suddenly happen? Where the heck did all these flaming swords come from?</p>

  <p>They all scurried about, trying desperately to avoid the swords that would no doubt burn them to ash on the spot.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>A sharp sword had pierced through the Celestial Wolf race's member, killing him immediately. It hit him on the head, setting his hair alight. The flames spread all over his body until he was nothing but burnt dust.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that the one from the Lofty Mountain race started regretting his actions.</p>

  <p>He knew where these swords had come from since he was the one who summoned those two demon women here.</p>

  <p>In his defense though, he never knew they would do such a thing! He never thought that those women would be cruel enough and regard his life as expendable.</p>

  <p>The man tried his best to avoid this rain of flaming swords but, in the end, failed to cheat death. He was pierced through by three golden swords and burnt to a crisp much like the Celestial Wolf member.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the man from the Moon Spirit race was clever and used his Other Shore Token to create a transparent light film around him.</p>

  <p>When the flaming swords penetrated through the light film, they would slow down, allowing him to easily avoid any that came near him.</p>
