  <p>These men draped with cloaks did not display the amount of power to defeat Nelly. How had they captured Nelly?</p>

  <p>Even with the absence of Divine Dao in this world, Nelly's power was enough to defeat the cloaked men easily.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng bet they should have relied on the eagles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had noticed that there were some special eagles, and their strength was far stronger than that of an ordinary eagle. There might be some extremely powerful individuals among the eagles raised by the cloaked men.</p>

  <p>Nelly looked quite upset.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gestured to the cloaked men, meaning for them to wait for a moment before he started walking towards the iron cage.</p>

  <p>Because her head was buried in her legs and she stayed motionless, Nelly didn't notice Luo Zheng's arrival at all.</p>

  <p>CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knocked on the iron fence.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off! I'm not going to eat your disgusting food!" Nelly exclaimed but didn't raise her head.</p>

  <p>The cloaked men would send her food every day in fear that she would die of starvation after they locked her up.</p>

  <p>But after all that had happened, how could Nelly swallow her pride and eat their food? Moreover, as a True God, she didn't need to eat anything.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng approached and put his hands behind his back. He then stared at Nelly with a faint smile and without saying a word.</p>

  <p>Nelly sensed something was wrong. Often, before the cloaked men left, they would say something she couldn't understand. Why was it so quiet this time?</p>

  <p>As she looked up and saw Luo Zheng, her eyes were filled with astonishment, and she was stunned for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Why are you here?"</p>

  <p>Her face had shown immense excitement and surprise at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Why? Can't I be here?" Luo Zheng said with a calm voice.</p>

  <p>Majority of the members of the Mu Clan did not give a good impression on Luo Zheng, but he had saved Nelly's life twice already.</p>

  <p>However, Nelly's elder sister, Rachelle, had tried to kill Luo Zheng once entering the valley. Because of this, Luo Zheng believed that Nelly must have told her sister something.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's opinion, Nelly had returned his kindness with ingratitude!</p>

  <p>"But how did you manage to make friends with these cloaked men?"</p>

  <p>Nelly asked as she noticed that the cloaked men treated Luo Zheng as a guest instead of an enemy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just shrugged his shoulders and chose not to answer.</p>

  <p>"Can you help me out?" Nelly begged.</p>

  <p>After hearing that, Luo Zheng displayed a mocking smile on his face and said,</p>

  <p>"Why should I save my enemy?"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng knew that his biggest enemy was the Dongfang Clan, the Mu Clan remained to be his first target. After all, it was Murphy who had planned to destroy the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Astonished at what she heard from Luo Zheng's mouth, the excitement in Nelly's face vanished.</p>

  <p>"It was my sister who wanted to kill you, not me..." Nelly gently bit her lip and tried to defend herself.</p>

  <p>"It's the same thing for me," Luo Zheng said with a smile before turning around to leave.</p>

  <p>Clang! Leaning against the iron fence, Nelly continued to explain, "I didn't know that she was planning to kill you! She only asked me to investigate your identity as the anonymous man. I didn't know that you are the son of Mike!"</p>

  <p>"That makes no difference to me," Luo Zheng said nonchalantly without looking back.</p>

  <p>Being the son of Mike, his hatred towards Nelly, the daughter of Murphy, could never be dissolved.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the cloaked man accompanying Luo Zheng asked, in their language, "Is she your friend?"</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng replied using their language.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng left with the cloaked men, leaving Nelly behind in the cage.</p>

  <p>Nelly was steaming with anger.</p>

  <p>She had the same temperament as her sister, Rachelle. No matter when or where she was, she always tended to be stronger in front of everyone!</p>

  <p>However, after following Luo Zheng into this strange world, she had gone through a period of tribulations and had almost been killed by several golden rocs for the trouble.</p>

  <p>After coming across some powerful eagles, in a fit of anger, she had killed three of them in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, she was captured by the cloaked men when she failed to defeat the more powerful eagles whose necks displayed brilliant white feathers.</p>

  <p>Nelly had always displayed pride and dignity to everyone, including the Mu Clan leader and other Holy Emperors.</p>

  <p>She had never felt so frustrated before!</p>

  <p>Even after confirming Luo Zheng's identity, Nelly still defended Luo Zheng. But now, Luo Zheng had shown his true colors without any hesitation!</p>

  <p>As the feelings of sadness and regret welled in her heart, Nelly became unable to control herself and burst into tears in the cage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already walked away from Nelly with the cloaked men.</p>

  <p>However, when he heard Nelly cry, he slowed down in his steps and his gaze softened.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was being honest, he actually thought that although Nelly had a strong character, she was not a bad person.</p>

  <p>This young girl should not be burdened by the long-standing hatred between the Luo Clan and the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng decided to observe the situation first since he did not know why Nelly had been imprisoned and why there was enmity between her and the cloaked men.</p>

  <p>During Luo Zheng's stay, he was well welcomed by the cloaked men and they arranged a house for him to stay in.</p>

  <p>They were very kind to him and did not restrict his freedom, allowing him to wander around their fortress.</p>

  <p>After living in the fortress for a few days, Luo Zheng gradually familiarized himself with their language. He was able to communicate smoothly with them and understood more about this group of people.</p>

  <p>He learned that they called themselves the Eagle race and were aboriginals of this world.</p>

  <p>They had been living with the eagles, and they had raised them ever since as weapons and friends.</p>

  <p>The eagles with white feathers on their necks were called the Royal Eagles, which were far more powerful than the average eagles. They were both their most powerful weapons and the entities believed to be overseeing them in a spiritual level.</p>

  <p>On the fourth day, Luo Zheng saw several members of the Eagle race being escorted to the square of the fortress.</p>

  <p>After the cloaks on their heads were removed, Luo Zheng looked at them from a distance and immediately recognized them at first sight. They were the ones who had taken him out of the desert.</p>

  <p>Then, they lifted their left arms and tied them to the railing nearby.</p>

  <p>Beside them, another member of the Eagle race took a long ancient sword. He slowly lifted it up. It looked like he was going to cut off their left arms!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and leaped up. He fleeted on the roof like a dragonfly skimming the surface of water and then landed lightly on the ground.</p>

  <p>Using their language, he asked, "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>The Eagle race member carrying the long sword glanced at Luo Zheng indifferently and then answered, "I'm penalizing them."</p>

  <p>"What wrong did they do?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"They failed to protect the Royal Eagle and it lost one of its wings," the executioner replied.</p>

  <p>"The Royal Eagle lost one wing so they have to pay with their arms?</p>

  <p>What if the Royal Eagle died? Should they pay with their lives?" Luo Zheng asked, his face streaked with an unmistakable darkness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is correct!" the executioner nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>"It's our fault that we didn't protect the Royal Eagle well."</p>

  <p>"We are willing to take the punishment."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm willing to accept the punishment."</p>

  <p>The members of the Eagle race being tied said one after another.</p>

  <p>The Royal Eagles were the spiritual deities of the Eagle race and no accident was allowed to happen to them. If the Royal Eagle died in the course of grazing, the race members grazing it would have to pay with their lives.</p>

  <p>This was the rule and practice of the Eagle race, so it was improper for Luo Zheng to intervene. However, he still asked, "Is there any way to get rid of their punishments?"</p>

  <p>The executioner shook his head. "It's impossible, unless the Royal Eagle can fly into the sky once again."</p>

  <p>After its wing was broken, they said that the Royal Eagle had lost its fighting capacity forever, which was a great loss to the Eagle race. The Eagle race members had to be extremely careful while grazing the Royal Eagles.</p>

  <p>"Let the Royal Eagle fly again?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed and a smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>For the Eagle race members, they could never mend a broken wing. But for Luo Zheng, it was not that difficult.</p>

  <p>If the Divine Dao could be used, Luo Zheng could directly use the Life Divine Dao to help the Royal Eagle grow a new wing. Now that the Divine Dao couldn't be employed here, he still could use the pills.</p>

  <p>He thought for a while and Nelly's face flashed in his mind. He smiled and said, "If I can help that Royal Eagle recover its broken wing, can you let them go?"</p>

  <p>"You can recover the broken wing?" The executioner stared at Luo Zheng with an incredible look.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly and said in a serious tone, "I suppose so."</p>

  <p>The executioner looked at Luo Zheng doubtfully. He did not really believe what this outsider had said, but he finally put down his long sword. "I have to report this to our chief first!"</p>
