<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3329 The Limit Of The Light Region </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It's him!"</p>

  <p>"He's actually escaped the Dark Region!"</p>

  <p>"Back off!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical power was no secret to the members of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>He'd even bested the mighty Haider. Zheng smashed the man into dust when he hit him. His foe was not strong enough to defend himself.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light were like ants to Zheng. He could squash them underfoot without half a thought. They were too weak to stand a chance against him.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light retreated one after another, while the members of the Golden Body race, led by Ajay, came forward.</p>

  <p>"Not them," said Ajay, looking at the fleeing Souls of Light in disdain. "It's me that was waiting for you."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at Ajay. The Golden Body race was truly worthy of its reputation. Ajay's body was made of gold, and it was obviously extremely strong.</p>

  <p>"I have no quarrel with you. If this is about the Bearing race, you might want to rethink this. You can't defeat me," Zheng said in a low growl.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." Ajay rested his chin in his hand, and his grin became even wider. "So arrogant. I'm from the Other Shore, and outsiders aren't even worth mentioning in my eyes. You're doomed!"</p>

  <p>With that, he suddenly stretched out his arms, and the muscles rippled under the pure gold. A powerful aura emanated from the figure.</p>

  <p>When the other members of the Golden Body race saw this, as one they all let out a deafening cheer.</p>

  <p>They were going to hang back. Ajay could defeat Zheng all on his own. He didn't need their help.</p>

  <p>Sensing Ajay's strong aura, Zheng soothed his soul and remained calm. He smiled and said, "Actually, I have a question."</p>

  <p>Ajay stared at Zheng and asked, "Oh really? And what might that be?"</p>

  <p>"If you are willing to become an Other Shore Token, how much Other Shore Power can you release?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>A living creature could also become an Other Shore Token. No doubt, they were much stronger than ordinary Other Shore Tokens. But those tokens would lose their freedom. They had to work for their owners. That was absolutely humiliating.</p>

  <p>When the Wild Gods found the Other Shore, they often enslaved the inhabitants, like the Golden Body race, and made them into Other Shore Tokens. But the denizens of the Other Shore had become more powerful since then, so only the weakest of them could be enslaved that way.</p>

  <p>Ajay's face darkened at Zheng's question. He clenched his fists and said angrily, "You will know after our fight!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Ajay stomped his foot, making a loud sound. The ground cracked and split open. A golden vortex encircled his fist. He swung at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I admit it. You're not weak," Zheng said as he raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Since the Bearing race wanted him dealt with, they concocted a thorough plan. They were sure that the Golden Body race could help them achieve their goal.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the golden vortex punch was aimed straight at him, Zheng quickly thought of the best course of action. As his right leg thrust out, his body tilted forward. In this way, he skillfully avoided the punch. When he stood up straight again, he grabbed Ajay's neck with one hand and lifted him up.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Then, he released him. As Zheng turned his back, Ajay fell to the ground hard.</p>

  <p>The impact caused the ground to recess, and a pit was formed. In the middle of it lay Ajay.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood at the edge of the pit and waved his index finger at Ajay. He pointed at the Dark Region and said, "Consider it as I've already killed you once. Since you had the courage to challenge me alone, I'll grant you an extra life."</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the precipice of the Dark Region. He could easily throw Ajay into the Dark Region just now, but decided against it.</p>

  <p>No matter what, they made it a fair fight. The other members of the Golden Body race could have jumped him, but they didn't, so he spared them.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's sense of fair play only incensed Ajay. To be beaten and spared was an even greater dishonor for a warrior of the Golden Body race. He didn't want Zheng to go easy on him, even if it meant death.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhhh!"</p>

  <p>Ajay roared as he leapt to his feet. He used the power of his aura to leave the pit and rose in the air. He landed near Zheng.</p>

  <p>He roared, reciting a series of mysterious, ancient words. The golden vortex surrounding his fists became even brighter and more powerful, and his body was faintly shrouded by the shadow of a golden hammer.</p>

  <p>This golden hammer was extraordinary. It used to be the most powerful weapon when the Golden Body race was at the height of its power. Not only that, it was intelligent. It was not only a supreme master of the Golden Body race, but an object of worship for that race.</p>

  <p>A look of surprise appeared in Zheng's eyes when he felt Ajay's power increase. To face it head-on would end bad. He used his footwork to quickly retreat.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Ajay kept throwing punches, but Zheng managed to dodge each one. Every time, Ajay's fists struck the ground, and it cracked under the mighty impact.</p>

  <p>It was now quite treacherous in that region, and one wrong move would send a man sprawling into a mighty chasm.</p>

  <p>The Golden Body race was indeed more powerful than the Abyss Spirit race from Stage Eleven, but their power was limited.</p>

  <p>Ajay should be one of the best of the Golden Body race, but he could only release 600 to 700 divine megatons of force. Such a force was strong enough to deal with the Souls of Light, but it was not even remotely powerful enough to defeat Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng did a quick calculation. The ultimate power of the Light Region of Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore should be under 1, 000 divine megatons, while the power of the strongest warriors should be nearly 1, 000 divine megatons.</p>

  <p>By comparison, the Dark Region was much more terrifying.</p>

  <p>The three-eyed boy and the huge ape could unleash thousands of divine megatons of force. Ajay was about as powerful as a black monkey. Besides, there were octopuses and Regal Jade creatures.</p>

  <p>Ajay attacked continuously, extending the battleground by at least a thousand feet, as Zheng kept retreating.</p>

  <p>"Roar! Roar! Roar!"</p>

  <p>"Why do you keep avoiding him? Retreat is not an option for a warrior!"</p>

  <p>"Coward!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Golden Body race cheered Ajay and mocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>They thought if Ajay hit Zheng, his terrifying power would mash him into a puddle of goo. But Zheng was so quick that Ajay couldn't harm a hair on his head.</p>

  <p>"Hey, guys! Why don't you gang up on him?"</p>

  <p>"You promised our race, don't you remember?"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Watching the battle, the people of the Bearing race grew quite anxious.</p>

  <p>They felt that it was too difficult for Ajay to take down Zheng alone, so there was no need for a fair fight. They'd have their pound of flesh, even if they had to be considered shameful.</p>

  <p>However, the members of the Golden Body race were all about integrity and honor, so they didn't care about what the Bearing race suggested.</p>

  <p>When there were few places left to stand, Ajay was finally exhausted. He'd cloven away most of the solid ground. He stood and gasped.</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned and said, "Now it's my turn."</p>

  <p>Before Ajay could react, Zheng had transformed into a gust of wind and rushed toward him.</p>

  <p>Zheng was weak in the Dark Region, but in the Light Region, he feared no one.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng flew straight at Ajay. At the last minute, he led with his elbow and struck the warrior full in the chest.</p>

  <p>The blow seemed weak, but it was actually massively powerful. Before Ajay could react, he felt a dull pain in his chest and had been flung backward.</p>
