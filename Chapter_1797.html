<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite the attempt with all their might and will, the grand sorcerer wasn't harmed at all. It was as though he was invincible, even though everyone knew the contrary to be true. Their attacks weren't strong enough, weren't hitting far enough.</p>

  <p>While everyone else was retreating, someone suddenly charged forward, leaving a puff of dirt and dust behind him as his feet quickly collided with the ground.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you crazy?" Lucille shouted.</p>

  <p>Before anyone could react, Luo Zheng had already rushed over to the grand sorcerer and had even broken quite a number of his barbs. He too was now submerged in the poisonous mist. The crowd watched, both stunned and amazed, as Luo Zheng was fearlessly engulfed by the green poison.</p>

  <p>When he was only a few feet away from the grand sorcerer, Luo Zheng dropped to the ground, somersaulted and grabbed the grand sorcerer's arm. Using the arm for propulsion, Luo Zheng flipped himself into the air and landed behind the grand sorcerer. He flung both his arms beneath the grand sorcerer's armpits and bound his chest tightly.</p>

  <p>"Launch a joint attack on him! Quick!" Luo Zheng roared.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mind went blank. Completely empty. He couldn't utter another sentence or think another clear thought. All he knew was that they had to kill the grand sorcerer, or none of them would survive.</p>

  <p>Nathan clenched his jaw and twisted his body, both hands grasping his spear.</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerer who had activated the Holy Poison Body was growing in power and he was now stronger than ever before. Given his current state, he would probably be capable of fighting against the grand world lords. What was more, there were even fewer flaws in his body.</p>

  <p>And with Nathan's cultivation, it was already extremely difficult for him to spot a grand world lord's flaw.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had managed to control the grand sorcerer despite the poisonous mist surrounding them both. How could he possibly have any reason to hesitate?</p>

  <p>The bloody light in his eyes flickered fiercely. He had already heavily overused his eyes' power. Now, as he reactivated them once again, his pupils burst. He suddenly became completely blind, and two streams of golden blood gushed out from his sockets.</p>

  <p>But just before his vision was taken from him forever, he finally saw the flaw in the Holy Poison Body. And that would be the last image he would physically see in a short time.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>His long spear flew into the air and began to vibrate, creating a spiral formation. With no time to react or counter attack, the Law Spear Strike began moving toward the grand sorcerer at high speed.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The spear attack landed no less than two inches below the grand sorcerer's chest.</p>

  <p>This was his Achilles heel. His weak spot, his most vulnerable part.</p>

  <p>Nathan rolled backwards, mostly out of conditioned reflex, and was grabbed by Lawson. Although he couldn't see anything, he very well knew that he should stand far away from the grand sorcerer.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerer's face was filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Having activated the Holy Poison Body, he had the ability and the strength to fight back, even against a grand world lord. There wasn't enough time and the grand sorcerer wasn't quick enough, despite his increased abilities. Before he could muster an attack, he was surrounded and killed by warriors of the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>He turned his head with great difficulty to look at Luo Zheng behind him. If any living creatures touched the poisonous mist, they would die instantly.</p>

  <p>Even the powerhouses like world lords wouldn't dare to get too close.</p>

  <p>How could it be that Luo Zheng had remained safe and sound?</p>

  <p>These eight Godly Geniuses were truly terrifying. Each one was more so than the next. What other uncommon, secret talents were they hiding?</p>

  <p>That was the last thought that came to the grand sorcerer's mind. With that, his body began to disintegrate, slowly crumbling away and transforming into wisps of black smoke. A few moments later, the grand sorcerer had completely dissipated into thin air.</p>

  <p>Once the black smoke had lifted somewhat and vision had begun to return, Zheng's figure slowly emerged from the darkness. The green, whirly poisonous mist still surrounded his body. From the looks of it though, and to everyone's disbelief, he was absolutely fine.</p>

  <p>A single thought flashed across the minds of Lawson and the others. Was the grand sorcerer's poisonous mist not as terrifying as they had all imagined? All this time, were they led to believe a lie?</p>

  <p>As soon as this thought appeared, they just quickly rejected it. The poisoning of the sorcerer race wasn't something they could underestimate or ever question. There was only one other possibility: Luo Zheng could be completely immune to the poison. No one had proven to be immune to such a great technique in the past!</p>

  <p>The poisonous mist was still attached to Zheng's body, trailing in wisps behind him, and thus no one dared approach him. Right now, the most important thing was to leave this damned place.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Tianming immediately created a space crack in the space with his sword, preparing their departure from the back side of the world. The crowd took a step back as the hairline crack began to pull apart, opening up into a full blown tear. Blackness filled the crack and despite the void, it was almost welcoming to see.</p>

  <p>As soon as one of the warriors stepped forward toward the space crack, the Torch Dragon's immense tail swung in their direction. People spread out in all directions in order to avoid getting smacked by the thick, scaly tail.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon was a vicious beast that was as powerful as a Supreme Lord in strength, but its body was several times larger. The energy contained within its tail alone might just be great enough to destroy an entire continent in a single motion. Fear filled the space once again.</p>

  <p>Unguarded from the attack, there was no way for anyone to properly avoid the dragon's tail whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon was fighting with Supreme Lord Mirage. With a far leap, he faced the dragon head on, weapon raised far above his head.</p>

  <p>Although Supreme Lord Mirage's methods were powerful, the Torch Dragon was equally remarkable. The most troublesome part was that Supreme Lord Mirage excelled in the Time Law, and the Heavenly Destiny he inherited was a Law of Causality of the Time Law. With that, he could bring time to a relatively still state.</p>

  <p>Nothing could completely stop time, not even the most powerful laws of the heavens. However, under the control of Supreme Lord Mirage, it could become infinitely slow, which would usually give him a great advantage of course.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, this method had a huge drawback. It was only effective on the life forms in the heavens.</p>

  <p>Because the Torch Dragon was not a being under the heavens to begin with, Supreme Lord Mirage's most powerful technique had lost all its effect on it. His master technique was rendered completely useless by this outrageous beast.</p>

  <p>He could only rely on his own abilities in order to continue fighting with the Torch Dragon. He knew that once Supreme Lord Sky killed the supreme sorcerer, they two might be able to kill the Torch Dragon together. It was only a question of time.</p>

  <p>But as he saw the eight Godly Geniuses appear at the back side of the world and the Torch Dragon's tail sweep towards them, the Supreme Lord's expression abruptly changed.</p>
