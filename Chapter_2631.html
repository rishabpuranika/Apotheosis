<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Burt, who was now curled up on the ground, let out a sudden, strangled laugh.</p>

  <p>Emily frowned at him. "What are you laughing at?" she barked.</p>

  <p>"Spark has come! Of course he's come!" he said, his eyes glowing as he stared at her.</p>

  <p>"So what?" she said, sneeringly. "He is no match for me. But I hadn't expected you exiles to be so stupid as to follow the Yellow Emperor race!"</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race was the second strongest in this world, but was still quite inferior to the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>There was almost no match for Emily in this world. Timotheus and Spark might be her opponents, but they were still inferior to her.</p>

  <p>"Or what? You think nothing of us!" Burt roared ferociously at Emily's words. "You big races always oppress us, step by step. You have the chance to escape now, but did you consider us? Did you count us? To be honest, I don't think the Warden race will really let us leave after we kill you. But since we can't leave, neither can you guys!"</p>

  <p>The exiles were taken aback at how fiercely Burt was reacting.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, the smaller races and their exiles had been oppressed to no end.</p>

  <p>Since it was the group of exiles who supported the development of a race, it was obvious that they were immensely strong. Although many of the small races chose to form allies, they still couldn't fight against the large races that were way stronger than them, especially top-rank races like the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>When the small races were oppressed, their exiles could only make their clansmen retreat. They couldn't change the fact that they had to endure what they were going through. And as time passed, the exiles became full of resentment towards the large races.</p>

  <p>They had lived in the same world in the past.</p>

  <p>Now that exiles like Burt had heard the news of the Snake Goddess race finding a way to escape from this world, the resentment they had accumulated over the years finally erupted.</p>

  <p>Just as Burt had predicted, since they were unable to leave, the large races of this world couldn't leave either.</p>

  <p>They were like a group of people stuck in a well and struggling to climb out. Those at the top were on the verge of escaping. But the people below them were so desperate that they did everything they could to hinder them.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap. Kill him and move on!" an exile of the Fire Melting race exclaimed. He walked up to Burt, his hand burning with a terrifying-looking fire.</p>

  <p>Emily sighed and turned around.</p>

  <p>In this world, they fought more fiercely against each other because of the lack of resources, and there wasn't anything they could do about it.</p>

  <p>"Fire!"</p>

  <p>The blazing flames quickly wrapped around Burt.</p>

  <p>Burt roared vicious curses through the flames. "You will die here. All of you will die here. No one will escape!"</p>

  <p>But just as the flames began to engulf Burt and drown him out, a kind of great energy emerged from his body. He had chosen to blow himself up!</p>

  <p>The power that the explosion of this powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm radiated was terrifying. Even though Burt was among the weakest of the exiles, the power of his self-explosion was still not to be underestimated. Even the remaining power that spread rapidly out was enough to pose a fatal threat to the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>There was, however, a galaxy of talents. Burt's body turned into a huge ball of light and began to expand in all directions.</p>

  <p>As Ramzi of the Nine Li race flashed past, a pale yellow talisman appeared in his hand. With a pat, the tentacles formed by the pale yellow lights enveloped the spreading light ball.</p>

  <p>Once tentacles had completely shrouded the light ball, the energy that it contained was blocked.</p>

  <p>'What a powerful method!'</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed inwardly.</p>

  <p>The exiles of the Nine Li race, except Timotheus, had never demonstrated what they were capable of. But the method that Ramzi had just showed was impressive, especially since it could offset the self-explosion of a powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm. Zheng admired him for his strength.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the energy produced by Burt's self-explosion reached its peak and then began to rapidly fade away. At last, under the power of the yellow talisman, it disappeared.</p>

  <p>"It's just the Soul Sealing Truth. It's not worth sighing about," No. 9527, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke up at Zheng's sigh.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Sealing Truth?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>Once Ramzi had released the talisman, Zheng had felt a strong force of seal within it. He hadn't expected it to be another Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"That's right. My master has said that the Truth of Godly Way gained through the Grand World Cultivation Method is undoubtedly powerful, but it can't be compared with the truth. They think they have reached the other shore, but this is not true,"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 said disdainfully. It wasn't in the mood to hide its feelings.</p>

  <p>"You mean, they haven't reached the other shore in the real sense?" Zheng said, aware that he was just on the brink of being rendered speechless at No. 9527's comment. Instead, he retorted, "Even if they haven't reached the other shore, they are far stronger than me now. That is why I haven't offered any help yet."</p>

  <p>Once they had entered this space, Emily and Timotheus had led the way.</p>

  <p>Zheng, and even the elders of the various races could only hide behind the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>The weakest warrior at the Other Shore Realm was not someone the Wild Gods could fight.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was not convinced. "It's because they are on a higher cultivation level than you. Wait and watch. The Warden race will finally use the Strength Equalizing Theurgy that Herbert passed on. By then, these powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm will definitely be stunned, and will have to rely on your Falling Star Palm."</p>

  <p>Once Zheng learned the Truth Crystal of the Chaos Ancient God, No. 9527 taught him the methods of using it.</p>

  <p>The methods of using the Truth Crystal were broad and profound. Zheng could not master some of them at his present stage. But the Falling Star Palm was the Chaos Ancient God's most basic theurgy.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had mastered it to some extent, he had never used it in front of others.</p>

  <p>The Truth Crystal itself was not so powerful in Zheng's opinion. It couldn't be as frightening as it was made out to be. Zheng thought it was far weaker than the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>"The Strength Equalizing Theurgy? What is it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng froze, almost forgetting that No. 9527, a wisp of the soul of the Chaos Ancient God, knew this world better than anyone.</p>

  <p>But he didn't ask about it before, nor did No. 9527 mention it.</p>

  <p>"Herbert was the Chaos Ancient God who pursued the equality of all living beings. He comprehended the Strength Equalizing Theurgy from the Godly Ways Great Unity. He built this prison, although his body isn't here. It isn't strange for the Warden race to use the Strength Equalizing Theurgy when they have to, is it?" No. 9527 explained patiently.</p>
