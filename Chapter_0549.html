<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Tides of lava are rising!" a warrior exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I also saw that. But now, we're not quite far away from the next high platform. It's right ahead of us!" another disciple responded. He pointed towards the direction of the coming platform.</p>

  <p>It was the second high platform in the Sea of Raging Fire, and was much bigger than the first one. It looked like a castle in the air. Beneath it, the platform was supported by dozens of pillars. Beside this platform was a road extending forward. What was intriguing was a small island near the platform!</p>

  <p>The island was just amid the Sea of Raging Fire.</p>

  <p>"Rush over quickly to the platform! Then, we will be safe!"</p>

  <p>While they might have been considerably surprised to see an island in the middle of the Sea of Raging Fire, the warriors still focused their attention on the high platform. They had to talk about everything else after they handled the problems at hand.</p>

  <p>Hope was coming. All of the warriors put their hopes on the high platform ahead. Consciously, they quickened their pace without being reminded by other disciples. As they reached the towering platform, every warrior heaved a sigh of relief. This platform was about thirty feet high. When the warriors arrived, all of them leaped onto the platform.</p>

  <p>There were no exceptions, because Luo Luo Zheng also steadily stepped onto the high platform and then planted his feet there securely.</p>

  <p>"This high platform is in the middle of the Sea of Raging Fire. In other words, we are somewhere halfway," a warrior explained while wiping the sweat on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"It is said that there is a hidden test on this high platform. Substantial benefits await the one who can successfully go through this test," another warrior blurted out, as he stared at the island behind the platform.</p>

  <p>"A hidden test?" Luo Luo Zheng said curiously.</p>

  <p>His heart was throbbing as he correctly guessed that the hidden test should be on that small island.</p>

  <p>Top masters of Cloud Hall badly wished to gain benefits from the Cloud Road, but they couldn't come here on their own owing to their higher cultivation levels. As a result, they had no choice but to train younger disciples so that they could have the chance to come here and explore for them.</p>

  <p>Compared to the elevated platform they had just passed, there were many more people crowding this platform. The previous platform was merely for warriors to protect themselves against the tides of lava. However, the second platform was a resting place for warriors. At this time, about twenty warriors filled the platform, including disciples from Auspice Sect, Brumous Sect, Iridescence Sect, and Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>But why were Patrick and Tianming not there? Craning his neck, Luo Luo Zheng didn't see any disciple from Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps, they have moved ahead, or stepped into the hidden test, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go to the island?" Luo Luo Zheng suggested. There was no hesitation in his voice when he spoke. He knew it was a rare chance for him to get the qualification he needed to step onto the Cloud Road. And Luo Luo Zheng wanted to seize this chance.</p>

  <p>Although there were tremendous risks in undergoing the hidden test, Luo Luo Zheng was convinced that enormous possibilities were going to open for him.</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, Luo Luo Zheng didn't sit down for meditation like other warriors. On the contrary, he walked straight towards the passageway at the end of the high platform.</p>

  <p>His decision to go to that small island shocked other warriors. Luo Luo Zheng was only at the third grade of nature level. But did he want to face the challenges in the hidden test? Did he want to die?</p>

  <p>Every time when disciples took the Cloud Road, many of the elite warriors undertook challenges at the hidden test. But how many of these fighters were lucky enough to get the chance to succeed? Instead of gaining any benefit, challengers were either severely injured inside, or worse, ended up dead after going through that pass. As the saying goes, people die in pursuit of great wealth, while birds die for food.</p>

  <p>Everyone was welcome to take risks to go through the test, but they must be fully aware of their abilities to determine if they could survive the pass or not.</p>

  <p>Beside the entrance of the passageway stood two disciples dressed in white robes. Both of them were from Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>When they saw Luo Luo Zheng walking up to them, their mouths curved at the corners. There were hidden sneers in their eyes, both directed at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the young disciple reached the entrance, one of the disciples yelled, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>Looking at the two guys who stood in his way, Luo Luo Zheng, his eyebrows slightly furrowing, shot back, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Now that disciples of our Cloud Hall are in there for the test, all other people are not allowed to enter."</p>

  <p>It was one of the Cloud Hall disciples who spoke with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"What? Ahhh... hahaha! Every person here is taking the test of Cloud Road. So, why are we not authorized to enter?" Luo Luo Zheng demanded. A dark cloud seemed to hover over his face as he spoke. In this world, it seemed there were always people looking down upon others, especially those they believed were inferior to them.</p>

  <p>For instance, in the beginning, when Luo Luo Zheng just joined Cloud Sect, disciples from noble clans believed themselves to be superior and looked down upon the young disciple. Now, disciples from Cloud Hall were behaving in the same manner. Did they truly believe that Cloud Road was developed only for them?</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng guessed it right.</p>

  <p>And it was true that these disciples took that for granted. After all, they were the rightful representatives of Cloud Hall. In their opinion, all guys from grade two sects under the jurisdiction of Cloud Hall were inferior and not qualified because they were not on equal footing with them.</p>

  <p>Since some of the Cloud Hall disciples had already entered the passageway for the hidden test, the two men at the entrance thought those from other sects were naturally "unauthorized" and disqualified for going through the pass.</p>
