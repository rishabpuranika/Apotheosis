<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was the leader of the Golden Mountain.</p>

  <p>When the sword radiance missed completely, the look on the leader's face did not flinch or change a bit.</p>

  <p>Instead, he raised his golden sword horizontally, and the roaring noises of dragons and tigers echoed from the blade of the sword.</p>

  <p>With his other hand, he pinched the sword and suddenly slashed out the golden sword. There were flames of fury behind his eyes.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Just then, the huge sword radiance roared away once again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the leaders of the other six mountains waited patiently for orders from the Taiyi Mountain. They made sure to never leave the arrays that they were guarding.</p>

  <p>Though the attack was powerful, it remained a challenge to hurt Phoenix or any of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After the leader of the Golden Mountain finally made his move, a violent wind rushed out from the other side. Apparently, countless swords were hidden in the wind, and this same wind swept away taking the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu and Phoenix with it.</p>

  <p>"Destroy!"</p>

  <p>The Azure Mountain's leader declared.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The forceful gusts of wind released bolts of lightning that exploded in all directions.</p>

  <p>Phoenix sat firmly and calmly on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>The corners of her mouth lifted up into a smile. "It seems that these old men don't even dare to come out. Are they just going to test it like this?"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, snake-shaped sword shadows began to approach her.</p>

  <p>These shadows created gray marks in the air, and multiplied dramatically over time. This was the move from the Bright Mountain, and it could cross spaces in order to hit its targets.</p>

  <p>Because Phoenix relied on a spatial magic treasure, she and the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu could easily avoid the attacks aimed at them. The leader of the Bright Mountain only hoped that the snake-shaped sword shadows would be able to hit her.</p>

  <p>However, though the shadows continued to spread out, they could not get to Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Right before Phoenix, an intense purple light shot up from the ground and pierced the sky. Afterwards, it descended and landed right above her head.</p>

  <p>It was a very long purple sword!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When the purple sword landed, it did not cause any pain to Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Rather, it brought out a purple glow that spread throughout the sky.</p>

  <p>Phoenix took a look at the purple glow, growing a mocking smile at their vain attacks.</p>

  <p>The Vastness Mountain had already become a chess piece of Emperor Ji. What was ironic was that they still had to act otherwise before the other six mountains.</p>

  <p>It was standard that the seven mountains used their own methods to attack behind the Sky Net. However, this was a tentative attack, and it was close to nothing.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a number of warriors stood on the Lofty Swords in the Oneness Array, trying to discuss what happened and what to do next.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to start?" Auden asked the group.</p>

  <p>Pearce's eyes squinted, trying to focus on what was happening so far away.</p>

  <p>"I think we should wait a little longer..."</p>

  <p>"But being burned by the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, the Sky Net won't hold on for long," said Auden.</p>

  <p>Among all the powerful swordsmen present, Auden had the highest attainments in arrays. He had also participated in the establishment of the Sky Net in the first place.</p>

  <p>He knew that although the Sky Net was sturdy, it could never endure continuous powerful attacks.</p>

  <p>"What's more, the Oneness Generals have already suffered a great loss," said Athemar, who was next to Auden.</p>

  <p>In battle, all the elites of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had been used to their limit. If the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards and the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were killed, it would be a loss that the warriors of the various sword sects grieved.</p>

  <p>Everyone who was there could resonate with Pearce's worry.</p>

  <p>As for their opponents, the Jin Wu, only Phoenix led a group to join the battle.</p>

  <p>Phoenix's strength was actually on the same level with that of Athemar and the rest. While the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were powerful, they were like puppets who lacked intelligence. Therefore, it would be impossible for those Corpse Spirit Jin Wu to break through the defense line of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>But since Phoenix was so calm, she must have a powerful backup.</p>

  <p>Still unwilling to take any action, Pearce had some misgivings. He hesitated, then reached out for a communication token. "Master Gentry, can you lead the Golden Mountain to attack first?"</p>

  <p>If they exerted all the strength of a mountain, there was no way Phoenix and the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu could resist. Then they would have to show their trump cards.</p>

  <p>Only after Pearce figured out her trump card, could he lead the Taiyi Heaven Palace to deal with her.</p>

  <p>That was the only chance.</p>

  <p>If the mountain leaders were all killed, the remaining warriors in the seven mountains wouldn't be able to protect the Taiyi Heaven Palace for long.</p>

  <p>They would be doomed to lose.</p>

  <p>"I will follow your orders but the seven mountains are connected and we should fight back together," the leader of the Golden Mountain spoke. "If the Golden Mountain takes the lead, I'm afraid it will make my people..."</p>

  <p>It came to a point that anyone knew whoever took lead, would end up dead.</p>

  <p>If he led his men towards the battle, there was no way they would survive.</p>

  <p>Even though the members of the Golden Mountain were not afraid of death, they never would have sacrificed in this way. Besides, Pearce's order couldn't make them obey fully.</p>

  <p>Gentry's words were transmitted to Auden and Athemar, who looked at each other and sighed in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Once again, Pearce held the communication token and begged the Ivory Mountain to make a move. However, like the leader of the Golden Mountain, the leader of the Ivory Mountain declined as well.</p>

  <p>Token after token, Pearce asked the leaders of mountains but received all the same refusal.</p>

  <p>After going through each mountain leader only to be declined, Pearce crushed the communication token in his hand and shook his head. "I have to admit that my words carry no weight as I'm in a low position. I cannot represent Eastern Emperor Taiyi..."</p>

  <p>He figured that if Eastern Emperor Taiyi led the battle, no mountain could disobey him.</p>

  <p>There would be no reason for them to refuse to spearhead the attack.</p>

  <p>Although Pearce and Auden were the elders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, they were no match for Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The mountain leaders would not be driven by Pearce, who was weaker and less important than them.</p>

  <p>"Elder Pearce, I'll go up with Goran!" Athemar volunteered enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>Goran also cupped his hands in agreement, his eyes flashing with a fierce determination to get it done.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you two are not enough," Pearce said. "If you go up like this, you'd die," Pearce said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Then I'm in!" said Master Hai, who hadn't spoken a word the whole time.</p>

  <p>"I've lived long enough. Count me in," Auden added, smiling.</p>

  <p>"And me..."</p>

  <p>"Elder Pearce, me..."</p>

  <p>Seeing all the willingness of them, Pearce couldn't help but smile. "Among the seven arrays guarded by seven mountains, the Oneness Array is the most important," he announced. "If you all go up, that would leave me to preside over this array alone."</p>

  <p>Everyone grew silent, and Goran gritted his teeth hearing this.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu' orderly advance really placed the Taiyi Heaven Palace in a dilemma that left them close to hopeless.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Athemar looked into the distance and spotted something odd.</p>

  <p>"Look, what's that?"</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, more than 100 Corpse Spirit Jin Wu soared gracefully in the air, but there seemed to be three Corpse Spirit Jin Wu circling below them. These three crows spewed out blue flames at their own members!</p>
