  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's first round of attacks was merely a trial run.</p>

  <p>Still, that didn't make it something that could be taken down so easily.</p>

  <p>Under the full force of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, regardless of whether it was the lightning or the wind blade, it was extremely sharp.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's control, the Nether God Shadows were all in different styles but all gave meticulous punches and kicks. For his opponent, it was no simple task to deal with the Nether God Shadows.</p>

  <p>During the three waves of attacks, Lucille's clear eyes were clouded.</p>

  <p>At this moment, she made a gesture? pressing the tips of her thumb and forefinger together, keeping the other three fingers raised. Her slender pinky was the most prominent, while the ring it wore emitted a faint, yellow light.</p>

  <p>"Earth Protection," Lucille said softly.</p>

  <p>The yellow light gradually condensed and formed the shape of a giant. It stood thousands of feet tall, enveloping Lucille within.</p>

  <p>The light brought along a heavy Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The lightning emitted by Luo Luo Zheng struck the yellow light heavily, leaving only a faint, charred mark before disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>As for the wind blade, it could only cut through an inch.</p>

  <p>Although the Nether God Shadows' fist techniques were undoubtedly exquisite with flawless coordination, they were unable to break through the powerful defense. It was even harder to reach Lucille as she stayed within the giant.</p>

  <p>"Such strong defense!" Luo Luo Zheng said with a raised eyebrow. Although he knew that the five rings on Lucille's hand were extraordinary, their true power exceeded his imagination. And at that point, she had only activated one ring.</p>

  <p>After blocking Luo Zheng's attacks, Lucille raised her palm toward him. With the corner of her mouth slightly curled up, she smashed her palm down.</p>

  <p>The action triggered the giant to do the same? it smashed straight down on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>An earth-shattering sound resounded. Vibrations rippled out from the impact.</p>

  <p>If warriors witnessed the scene from above, they would see a gigantic palm print on the empty space next to the city. Surrounding it were countless cracks, rapidly spreading out and expanding. The surrounding earth continued to shake.</p>

  <p>When the giant palm landed, Luo Luo Zheng flew backward, barely dodging it.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the palm print on the ground, the gravity of the situation grew clearer in Luo Zheng's eyes. But his fighting spirit began boiling up just as much.</p>

  <p>His most important goal after he had ascended to the Upper World was finding Yan.</p>

  <p>But he had never forgotten to pursue his own cultivation and surpass his own limits.</p>

  <p>Since he had stepped into the Upper World, he hadn't been able to fight anyone of the same cultivation level as him.</p>

  <p>But in the Illusion Battlefield, he managed to complete his long-cherished wish? he would face the talents from different races in the whole universe and the ace talents of various races.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that too exaggerated?"</p>

  <p>"Humph! Do you think anyone can be called the ace talent? Even a great force won't necessarily have many ace talents. A warrior like her will no doubt become outstanding among the world lords after becoming one. If she becomes a Supreme Lord, she would be a top-ranker. As the world of chaos has begun, all the races have poured their resources into the ace talents of their own race. These ace talents are the hopes of the big clans and races."</p>

  <p>"That also widens the gap between them and the other Soul Sea Realm warriors. Warriors like us will never stand out."</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of warriors had already gathered on top of the city walls. The loud sound drew most of their attention.</p>

  <p>Although Lucille's palm had shaken the earth for hundreds of miles, the cracks on the ground extending as far, the city beside them remained unmoved. Only sound was transmitted from the palm.</p>

  <p>Missing her target, she raised her hand, ready to strike again.</p>

  <p>The first palm strike was from the top-down, covering the entire area.</p>

  <p>The second palm strike was like a slap across the face as her palm made a wide, sweeping motion.</p>

  <p>The swing wasn't dramatically fast. The giant stood countless times larger than Lucille, and swung its arm just as fast as she did.</p>

  <p>So the strike was still undoubtedly overwhelming.</p>

  <p>Half of the giant's hand sunk into the ground, scraping the soil and grasses high up into the air, aiming for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If this strike hit Luo Luo Zheng, he would have flown into the city wall. Under the pressure of the wall and palm, he would've easily been crushed.</p>

  <p>But of course, Luo Luo Zheng didn't let that happen. With a stomp of his legs, he rolled over and avoided the palm that was as wide as the city wall.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Watching Luo Zheng's actions, Lucille only snorted and struck once again, down from the sky with her other hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was like a fly in front of this giant? after having just taken to air and caught off guard, he was smacked into the ground by the giant's other hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're weaker than I thought. I've only used the Earth Element Power."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished her sentence, she withdrew her left hand and viciously dug downward.</p>

  <p>The giant's left hand dug out the soil within a hundred-foot radius.</p>

  <p>Having been smacked into the mud, Luo Luo Zheng naturally fell into the giant's hand.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Lucille's right hand moved toward her left? her hands lightly clapped as if she was clapping for a certain someone. If one took notice, they'd hear her soft applause.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the giant's hands constantly clapped, which produced deafening rumbles.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was crushed mercilessly by the pair of giant hands.</p>

  <p>For each of Lucille's claps, the surrounding warriors on top of the city walls couldn't help but wince.</p>

  <p>"What terrifying might! I'm afraid the brat has turned into minced meat."</p>

  <p>"Goodness, this woman is too scary!"</p>

  <p>"Where are his Illusion Points? That brat should be dead by now. He should have returned to the city to revive himself."</p>

  <p>Everyone was puzzled? Luo Luo Zheng should've been dead already, but why couldn't they see his Illusion Points? Could it be that he was still alive?</p>

  <p>Pak, pak, pak!</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom, boom!</p>

  <p>As Lucille lightly patted her fair, clean hands, the giant slapped its own.</p>

  <p>Her clear eyes pierced through the yellow light to observe the situation outside.</p>

  <p>Under her continuous slaps, the soil scattered, and Luo Zheng's figure was revealed.</p>

  <p>The mud and gravel helped reduce the impact for Luo Luo Zheng, but once they scattered away from him, the impact on him was direct.</p>

  <p>Pak, pak, pak!</p>

  <p>But something wasn't quite right, and surprise grew clear in Lucille's eyes.</p>

  <p>Even as Luo Luo Zheng was slapped by the huge palms, Lucille could see that his Mu Ning hadn't weakened in the slightest, and there were no visible injuries on his body.</p>

  <p>'It's no wonder he killed Norton like it was nothing. His body is actually this strong!' she thought.</p>

  <p>The fact made her eyebrows furrow.</p>

  <p>The fingers of her left hand gently rose, binding Luo Luo Zheng to her palm, as she raised her right hand and pressed down hard on him with her index finger.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng lay on his back in the giant's hand, the giant's finger pressed down on him with a frightening force.</p>

  <p>The power of this attack was concentrated? even more terrifying than the massive palm attacks.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Luo Luo Zheng smiled and raised his fist toward the giant's finger.</p>

  <p>Compared to the giant's finger, Luo Zheng's fist was almost invisible? the mere tip of the giant's finger was several times thicker than his whole body.</p>

  <p>The scene was shocking.</p>

  <p>In front of this giant, Luo Luo Zheng was merely an ant that could be crushed with a finger.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the bystanders, he was completely trapped in this calamity.</p>
