<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 935 The Roar </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone's heart suddenly skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Let alone these people, even powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm would be dwarfed by the size of the monster. They looked like ants in comparison to it, and they instantly knew that they wouldn't stand a chance against it.</p>

  <p>"Turn around, don't look at it, and cover your ears," Yolande quickly ordered as she turned her head away from the huge monster.</p>

  <p>Quickly, the others followed suit. They turned their heads around and covered their ears as well. Any form of resistance was useless now.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Immortal Root suddenly raised its head and roared. The loud sound caused the entire Dark Nether Cave to tremble.</p>

  <p>As a result, the many sharp stalactites growing from the ceiling of the Dark Nether Cave began breaking, and one by one, they smashed and fell down on the cave's floor.</p>

  <p>One of the stalactites, which was over 200 feet long, headed towards the group. At that very moment, Yolande's eyes narrowed. As if on instinct, she raised her hand. A ray of light shot out from her finger, and it instantly shattered the crashing stalactite into many little pieces.</p>

  <p>As the whole cave shook, the root continued to roar fiercely. Five minutes passed until the cave was silent again.</p>

  <p>Yolande then turned to the others and said in a hushed voice, "The Mad Scorpion has awoken. Be ready."</p>

  <p>Everyone's face contorted to show confusion, fear, and uncertainty. The giant beast had been sleeping, but obviously, it was impossible for it to continue sleeping when something as huge as the root roared relentlessly.</p>

  <p>Together, everyone turned around to look at the Mad Scorpion, and sure enough, it had already opened its eyes.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Since the Mad Scorpion had only woken up from its long, long slumber, its eyes were still unfocused. With its huge palm, it touched the top of its head.</p>

  <p>As it did that, the Dark Nether Death Light above its head suddenly grew several times stronger. The scarlet light enveloped the entire Dark Nether Cave, brighter and stronger than even the sunlight.</p>

  <p>"Even the fog might not be able to stop this light. If there are other warriors inside the Dark Nether Cave, I'm sure that they have been killed, " Esther quietly said, her head lowered.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, because of the Tide of Chaos, most of the warriors had returned to the Tower of Sin. Only a small number of them wanted to take advantage of the Tide of Chaos to obtain greater chances in finding treasures inside the cave. And since they dared to take risks, they had to accept the cost that came with it, even if it was their lives.</p>

  <p>The Mad Scorpion's huge head slowly turned around to glance at the Heavenly Immortal Root. Then it suddenly opened its huge mouth and roared back at the root.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>Yolande's expression turned to fear as she said to Luo Luo Zheng urgently, "Quick, make a deep pit!"</p>

  <p>As the Mad Scorpion started howling, a huge hurricane formed. Luckily, the abyss was incomparably huge, and so although the hurricane had an awful lot of force, it would still take some time for it to blow over.</p>

  <p>As soon as Yolande finished speaking, Luo Luo Zheng and Malcom took action.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng used all of his strength at once, including the power of dragon scales, and Malcom also pushed himself to his limits. Nobody knew how strong the hurricane was, but they wouldn't risk being against it. While it was okay to be swept away like that, they would instantly die if they left Luo Luo Zheng and were exposed to the Dark Nether Death Light emitting from the Mad Scorpion's head.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Under the powerful forces emitted by both Luo Luo Zheng and Malcom, a huge crater that was more than 100 feet deep was formed. Without wasting any time, they immediately jumped into it, hoping it was enough to spare them from all the dangers of the cave.</p>

  <p>Immediately after entering the crater, Luo Luo Zheng and Malcom continued deepening the crater, blasting the ground with their powerful attacks.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they were in a pit with a depth of 300 feet.</p>

  <p>The moment everyone was able to get to the bottom of the pit, even before all of them could catch their breath, they heard the sound of a raging wind coming from above them. The wind swept past their pit, and a great amount of dust and rocks were blown in. They hit their faces, and it felt as if there were knives cutting through them.</p>

  <p>Fabian and the others immediately directed their life vitality to protect themselves. Rehaan was a bit too slow. As a result, the wind had left many wounds all over his body, making him an appalling sight to behold.</p>

  <p>"Are we deep enough?" Luo Luo Zheng screamed, looking up with a nervous expression.</p>

  <p>They saw the edges of the pit constantly collapsing as the fierce wind danced around it. Slowly it dawned on them that the wind was trying to level the pit.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, the pit that was over 300 feet deep was indeed leveled.</p>

  <p>"Continue digging down!" Malcom shouted loudly and directed his force to the ground again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't stop either. The others joined the two and continued to deepen the pit.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The huge pit they were in was constantly being leveled by the strong wind, and so they kept digging downwards. They went deeper underground in hopes of avoiding the strong wind that seemed to be looking for them.</p>

  <p>The Mad Scorpion's roar was many times louder than the one from the Heavenly Immortal Root. With just one roar, the entire Dark Nether Cave was thrown into chaos.</p>

  <p>On the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin, Teresa from the Demon Night had just come out of the Talent Tablet. After accepting the test of the Talent Tablet, her talent had reached the third row. This result was quite outstanding, considering she was a member of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Currently, in the Tower of Sin, she was the one with the best results among the members of her race. However, there wasn't the slightest bit of happiness on her face. On the contrary, there was only endless loneliness and fear.</p>

  <p>When she had first entered the Tower of Sin, she had solemnly vowed to challenge and defeat Luo Luo Zheng. However, Luo Zheng's golden name, like a big mouth, mocked her for overestimating her abilities.</p>

  <p>She had realized that she had no right to treat Luo Luo Zheng as her opponent.</p>

  <p>Teresa gritted her teeth as she continued walking towards the arena with her weapon in hand. Never in her life did she concede. Even if Luo Zheng's talent was far greater than hers, she would still put in ten times the effort to try and defeat him. 'One day, ' she thought, 'I will surpass you, Luo Luo Zheng.'</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng, who had improved rapidly and massively and had already climbed up to the 14th floor, was inside the Dark Nether Cave, she didn't have the chance to challenge him anymore.</p>

  <p>Just as Teresa was about to enter the arena, a violent vibration came from beneath her feet, followed by a deep roar. It was a roar that came from underground.</p>

  <p>The creatures of many races looked at each other with nervous expressions.</p>

  <p>They were well aware that underneath the Tower of Sin, or perhaps the entire Cursed Land, was the Dark Nether Cave. However, they didn't know who let out such a loud roar.</p>

  <p>Could it be that some monster was approaching the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>"W-what kind of monster is that? It makes such a loud noise. My god!"</p>

  <p>"The people who entered the Dark Nether Cave must be in trouble now. It seems that there's something strange going on in the cave!"</p>

  <p>"You have no idea. Due to the Tide of Chaos recently, most of the top-level war lords have retreated, and only a small portion of them are still in the cave."</p>

  <p>"I heard that Luo Luo Zheng and Esther from the Demon Night haven't returned! Looks like they're going to die in there!"</p>

  <p>The intense roar lasted for a long time, and the entire Tower of Sin continued trembling.</p>

  <p>Besides those in the Tower of Sin, people throughout the Cursed Land heard the roar as well. Two hours later, the roar had even spread throughout the entire Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the purple clad Amber stood on the top of the huge holy tree. Her sharp ears were alert, listening for more.</p>

  <p>When the violent roar spread from underground, the holy tree of the Demon Night started to tremble.</p>

  <p>The holy tree had a soul. It uneasily confided its fear to Amber. At that moment, all the living beings in the sacred place of the Demon Night were terrified. It was as if the end of the world was drawing nigh.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. Take it easy." Amber gently caressed the tree, communicating with it in a soft voice to soothe its trembling heart.</p>

  <p>Apart from the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the Purple Heart Sacred Place of the human race, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place of the ogres, the Eternal Night Sacred Place of the Night Group, and all the living creatures in the sacred places of the various races were all filled with unease and fear.</p>

  <p>A full two thousand feet!</p>

  <p>Within a short period of time, Luo Luo Zheng and Malcom had repeatedly hammered the ground and they had dug a huge pit that was two thousand feet deep.</p>

  <p>The rocks and mud that had accumulated overhead almost buried them.</p>

  <p>However, even though they were hiding in such a deep pit, it did not lessen the unease in their hearts. The roar was simply too dreadful.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the roar gradually faded away. Because of the long distance, the gale above their heads gradually dissipated. After making sure that it was already safe, everyone started moving the rocks and soil above their heads away and slowly made their way out of the pit.</p>
