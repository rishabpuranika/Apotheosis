<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The one who controlled the Chilling Bone Land had the privilege of choosing and recruiting talents in the chaos before anyone else.</p>

  <p>This privilege was only enjoyed by the Nihility race, though they were always known for being extremely picky.</p>

  <p>Those who were selected by the Nihility race were often outstanding warriors with terrifying and unique abilities, or their spokespersons in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Expressions of curiosity were plastered over the faces of the Other Shore creatures present.</p>

  <p>Who was this Evil God? He was a mere youth who hadn't even reached the Eternal Realm yet. How was he recruited by the Nihility race?</p>

  <p>To think that he was also asking this other human youth from the Oneness Sky Palace to join the Nihility race!</p>

  <p>Of course, these things had nothing to do with the Other Shore creatures but they strained their ears to listen out of sheer curiosity.</p>

  <p>"From what you know of me, do you think I can be persuaded?" Zheng asked as the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was born from Zheng's inner world and he had been there for a long time so of course he knew him quite well.</p>

  <p>In fact, it could be said that he spent most of his life trying to figure out how Zheng's mind, as the God of Creation, worked.</p>

  <p>Given his extensive knowledge of Zheng's personality, the Evil God was quite sure that it was going to be impossible to convince him to join the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Any sort of sweet-talking would only result in disappointment.</p>

  <p>The Evil God shook his head. "I know I may not be able to talk you into this, but I know someone who can."</p>

  <p>Zheng raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued by this sudden ace that his creation held. "Pray tell, who is this person?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled and took two steps back. As his toes lightly tapped on the bronze ground, he lay down on the blood-red ball and Zheng watched as it slowly wrapped around his body and completely sucked him in.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>After the blood-red ball which carried the Evil God left, the last of the three, blood-red balls slowly floated over.</p>

  <p>The first blood-red ball carried Samantha, the second carried the Evil God while the third...</p>

  <p>A trace of curiosity glinted in Zheng's eyes as he wondered who was within that third ball. Who exactly was this person the Evil God was so confident in?</p>

  <p>His questions would be answered soon enough. A black figure began to slowly emerge from the ball but when that person appeared, a strange aura permeated everyone's hearts. It felt as if their thoughts were being read and revealed to this newcomer!</p>

  <p>Every single Eternal Realm warrior from the Violet Cloud race, the Three Eyes race, and all other races revealed extremely shocked expressions.</p>

  <p>"He actually returned to Stage Thirty-two in person..."</p>

  <p>"It's him!"</p>

  <p>"He actually came back for a mere human?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was frozen in shock, still trying to find the logic in the situation.</p>

  <p>The one that caused all this hubbub was a young man, dressed in a grey overcoat. He had curly hair, and a somewhat sunken, unhealthy face with eyes that revealed a deep melancholy.</p>

  <p>He looked every bit an ordinary, if not famished, person.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng could sense that he was by no means a simple person. There was just something extraordinary about him, that much he was certain.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Zheng knew there was nothing to be afraid of and chose to speak first. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The mysterious youth's eyes wandered around before they turned to Zheng. "I am the Grandmaster of Heaven and the leader of the Nihility race," he declared.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body trembled at this sudden announcement.</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster of Heaven!"</p>

  <p>He knew of this person's existence from the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Shortly after entering the Creation Myth Temple, Zheng was privy to various information about him.</p>

  <p>This so-called Grandmaster of Heaven had been the Primeval Lord of Heaven's junior fellow disciple and was also a member of the Nihility race...</p>

  <p>Of course that was then. Now, he actually introduced himself as the leader of the Nihility race!</p>

  <p>Some of the Other Shore creatures were also a bit shocked by how the Grandmaster of Heaven introduced himself.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Nihility race!</p>

  <p>That meant he was one of the strongest existences on the entire Other Shore.</p>

  <p>What was more amazing was the fact that he personally went back to Stage Thirty-two just to convince this young man, who had yet to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, to join the Nihility race!</p>

  <p>A trace of embarrassment appeared on Egan's face. "Grandpa, maybe this guy doesn't need me to help him..." he mumbled shyly.</p>

  <p>Back in Stage Thirteen's Dark Region, he had already known that Zheng wasn't simple.</p>

  <p>However, as an Other Shore creature of Stage Thirty-two, Egan still carried an air of arrogance around him and paid his suspicions no mind.</p>

  <p>In short, he didn't really take Zheng that seriously when he met Zheng again.</p>

  <p>But now, it was an entirely different matter. To think that the Grandmaster of Heaven himself would show up just because of him? Zheng was definitely no ordinary person!</p>

  <p>"Yes. I didn't expect this," the leader of the Three Eyes race said with a cautious expression.</p>

  <p>He also did not understand how things came to this but since the Grandmaster of Heaven was involved, then this was no simple matter.</p>

  <p>After experiencing this short period of shock, Zheng quickly collected himself and called for a bit of help inside his mind. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, your junior fellow disciple has appeared."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven rarely mentioned his fellow disciples so Zheng did not really know what was between them.</p>

  <p>Since the Grandmaster of Heaven had come in person to talk him into joining the Nihility race, he thought it necessary to remind the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>However, the previously talkative Primeval Lord of Heaven remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven..." Zheng called out again. To his dismay, there was no answer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven smiled at Zheng and exuded a gentle and elegant aura. "It'll be useless to call him. He won't come out to see me."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened in astonishment. "You can hear my thoughts?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>He communicated with the Primeval Lord of Heaven through pure consciousness so there was no way other people would be able to hear their conversations.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven shrugged nonchalantly. "The Grand Plain Stage has suppressed most of my abilities so I can't really read your mind.</p>

  <p>Let's just say it was a smart guess on my part."</p>

  <p>Zheng huffed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"You guessed?"</p>

  <p>Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven refused to come out, Zheng realized that he would have to deal with this matter on his own.</p>

  <p>He had already met with a lot of powerful human warriors these past few months so he wasn't really that nervous in facing off against the Grandmaster of Heaven. Besides, contrary to his grand name, the Grandmaster of Heaven wasn't imposing at all and looked quite approachable.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to invite you to our Nihility race. If you join us, you will have everything you could ever want," the Grandmaster of Heaven promised.</p>

  <p>"Everything?" Zheng repeated skeptically. "Do you know what it is that I want?"</p>

  <p>Zheng left the divine land for the sake of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>However, after his trip to the Pear Hill, he realized that there were some goals that were still far beyond his reach. The world wasn't as simple as he had first thought and there was the existence of an Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was just as the Snake Goddess said: the most urgent thing was not reviving the Nine Li race, but completing the Finale Way. Because if the chaos was destroyed, nothing could be done.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, his deep eyes penetrating deep within Zheng's heart. "I can help you rebuild the Nine Li race and restore it to its glory. I can even make your grandfather Chiyou come back to life. I can make all that you want yours, so what do you think?"</p>

  <p>If ever the Grandmaster of Heaven followed his promise and revived Chiyou, the one he would revive was the Chiyou of this round of chaos.</p>

  <p>Such a feat was not easy, especially since the Nine Li race was a super force. It should also be taken into account that the Nihility race had to face pressure from the Element Spirit race. They truly wanted Zheng to join them to have promised such things.</p>
