<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2288 Rejection </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Zheng won against Nelly, he equally won the final battle in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>The Gods Killing Sword Array hadn't fought with its ultimate strength.</p>

  <p>In fact, although Zheng had destroyed Nelly's own body after releasing all four of the swords, he could do nothing at all to her Avenging Body.</p>

  <p>In the end, Zheng never truly defeated Nelly's Avenging Body, but fortunately, the Arena of Legends still announced him to be the winner of the battle.</p>

  <p>The next step Zheng had to take care of was losing to Liusu and giving her his points.</p>

  <p>In this way, it would be difficult for the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands to investigate the anonymous man's true identity. Moreover, Zheng could make an attempt in becoming a True God by taking in the mysterious mud.</p>

  <p>As Zheng glanced at the wall, he found that Liusu's name was grey, which meant that she wasn't in the Hall of True Gods. Even if he challenged her, he wouldn't receive her response.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no interest in continuing to challenge the other low-rank True Gods. Without lingering much longer, he left the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>Now, his room was ranked first in the Hall of True Gods. Nelly, on her behalf, had fallen down two places, currently positioned behind Liusu. As for Pearl's room, it was still second.</p>

  <p>In Joy's palace, the atmosphere was sullen.</p>

  <p>Liusu buried her head in Joy's chest, sobbing.</p>

  <p>Joy was trying to comfort her, frowning somewhat.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't told her what had happened between him and the Dongfang Clan. Thus, there was no way she could have expected him to be in such trouble.</p>

  <p>If the Dongfang Clan really wanted to retrieve Zheng from the Han Clan, the pressure would be passed on from Samuel to Joy.</p>

  <p>Zheng was now in an anonymous state. Other than himself, Joy, Liusu, and her sister, Aleyna, it was possible that no else knew who the anonymous man was.</p>

  <p>If Joy hadn't told anyone else about Zheng's identity, they would never find him.</p>

  <p>The question was whether she was capable of resisting the pressure.</p>

  <p>"Samuel has made a mistake," Joy said in a low voice, as she stroked Liusu's silky hair gently with her fingers.</p>

  <p>In a state of depression, Liusu had confessed a lot of things to Joy, such as how she had made acquaintance with Zheng in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land as well as her future plans.</p>

  <p>The little girl's courage made Joy sigh with admiration. Liusu had regarded Zheng as her soul mate. If there was any chance for him to escape from the Floating Island with her, she even hoped Joy could help them.</p>

  <p>Honestly speaking, had it been any other warrior aside from Zheng, Joy could have given Liusu a hand.</p>

  <p>There were many cases where the disciples from the Floating Islands eloped. Not all of them hoped to become stronger, with the desire to stand on the peak of the Godly Way. A few True Gods pursued other goals, such as true love.</p>

  <p>Liusu could elope with the man she loved, but Zheng, on the other hand, couldn't.</p>

  <p>The burden Zheng carried on his shoulders was much heavier than that of Liusu.</p>

  <p>"But since you know Zheng's origin, are you aware of what he's ultimately facing? The road he's going to travel will be extraordinarily dangerous, and he risks being smashed to bits because of his carelessness..." Joy knew very well what Zheng was about to face and what a dangerous situation he was actually in.</p>

  <p>"So what? I don't care. I'm not afraid of death!" Liusu shouted back firmly.</p>

  <p>Joy gave her a gentle smile and shook her head. "You youngsters just don't take life and death seriously. But, you know, certain things are of greater importance than life and death themselves."</p>

  <p>Liusu didn't understand what Joy meant; she pursed her lips and said determinedly, "I can only hope that you withstand my father's pressure."</p>

  <p>"You can rest assured on that note. I have made my decision, and it is therefore impossible for me to hand Zheng over to anyone," she smiled.</p>

  <p>Prior to being conferred the title of Demi-holy Being, she had been imprisoned in the Han Clan for quite some time. During that period, all she could do was helplessly watch the Luo Clan's destruction. She had felt regretful for many years that followed.</p>

  <p>She knew Mike had placed all his hopes on Zheng. How could she give him up to the Dongfang Clan?</p>

  <p>Deep inside though, Joy knew that if the Dongfang Clan really wanted Zheng, she would be put under unprecedented pressure. Besides, the Dongfang Clan wasn't like the Liu Clan, the Xie Clan or any other weaker clan. It was safe to say that the Dongfang Clan was the ruler of all clans.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the light that was enveloping Zheng from the Jade Wall of Legends slowly dissipated.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body trembled slightly, and then he jumped up from the ground.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Joy, who was holding Liusu in her arms. He had no idea what the two women were talking about. Immediately, his facial features contorted themselves into a strange expression.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-three wins in a row? Really?" asked Joy, smilingly.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng only nodded. He hadn't told Liusu his identity as the anonymous man, and thus, he had no clue what to say in the moment.</p>

  <p>Clearly, he could see that Joy had discussed something with Liusu, but he didn't know why Liusu was even here today.</p>

  <p>"It's time you lost your points to me!" Liusu said with a smile as she managed to collect her emotions. As she spoke, she stepped toward the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>Cooperatively, Zheng activated his jade token. As he was about to slip it into the slot of the Jade Wall of Legends, a gust of fragrance blew from one side, and Liusu jumped into his arms, holding him tightly.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene, Joy could do nothing but shake her head and sigh helplessly.</p>

  <p>Joy was also thinking things over very carefully. Harold had provided Zheng with a clear hint. Hallet and Augustus never fought in the open battles. The disciples of both Holy Beings had made their big moves.</p>

  <p>Now, she was thinking perhaps she should do something, too.</p>

  <p>Deep inside, she didn't give up just yet. That said though, as the Han Clan's Demi-holy Being, Joy was involved in many things. In other words, she couldn't allow herself to act rashly, like the bold youngsters could.</p>

  <p>Liusu was holding him tightly that Zheng's body stiffened. He didn't know how to respond to her reaction.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Liusu lessened her hold and asked, "If one day you want to leave the Floating Island, can you take me with you?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to leave this place?" Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible for him to agree to her request without hesitating. As per what Joy had said, he clearly knew what he was facing and how difficult it was.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan may request to take you from our Han Clan. I've asked my father and he probably wouldn't refuse," Liusu whispered.</p>

  <p>Zheng had helped the Han Clan a lot in the ranking of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Despite that though, her father just couldn't wait to send Zheng to the Dongfang Clan. In fact, he'd do so in a hurry. His attitude disappointed her bitterly, so much so that she was even embarrassed to disclose that to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I won't go to the Dongfang Clan." Zheng placed his hands on Liusu's shoulders, slightly pushed her back and added with a smile, "I'll leave the Floating Island long before they come for me."</p>

  <p>"I know," Liusu nodded. Other people had to try figuring out what Harold had meant, but there was no need for her to do so. Harold knew Zheng was in the Han Clan's Floating Island, and of course Liusu knew what Harold had tried to tell Zheng. "I want to leave here with you anyway!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head slightly. "No," he said firmly and inserted the jade token into the Jade Wall of Legends. Once again, he stepped into the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>As she watched Zheng react, Liusu pursed her lips. She activated her jade token in a fit of rage and she too, entered the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had seen the name "Liusu" written on the screen, Zheng chose to challenge her.</p>

  <p>Before long, Zheng stepped into the Arena of Legends. He was actually on a strange island, and surrounding him was the vast sea. This was probably the scene selected by Liusu.</p>

  <p>The said island was barely over a hundred feet wide, and as a battle ring between two True Gods, this was much too small.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, it was Liusu's turn to step into this world. She walked directly over to Zheng and asked, "Why did you refuse me?"</p>

  <p>"You'll die." Zheng thought for a moment and then added, "Or perhaps I'd say you have very high chances of dying, because it's very dangerous."</p>

  <p>"And what if I told you I would definitely die if I chose to stay here?"</p>

  <p>Liusu asked in a serious tone, all while staring Zheng straight in the eye.</p>
