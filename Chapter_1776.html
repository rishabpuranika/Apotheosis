<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1776 The Divine Kingdom Continent </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In the air, Preston covered his mouth with a hand and coughed twice while he was descending from the sky.</p>

  <p>A pensive look took over his face as several thoughts raced in his mind.</p>

  <p>The past weeks had been the most challenging period he had to endure so far.</p>

  <p>The small skulls had been extremely terrifying. When the amount of his life vitality was still sufficient and adequate, Preston could still prevent them from biting him. But eventually, the small skulls managed to devour all his protective life vitality, and chewed his skin, flesh, bones, and internal organs. A small skull even drilled into his internal organs and he had to forcibly dig it out to avoid further damage. He sustained several deep injuries, but Preston, with his strong will, persevered and endured the pain and torment.</p>

  <p>Casting his gaze down, he caught the trace of what seemed to be a town.</p>

  <p>"Look, there's a town below, but I don't know which force it belongs to,"</p>

  <p>Preston uttered, pointing a finger at the cluster of houses beneath them.</p>

  <p>Yudie looked down, her eyes raking over the entire continent.</p>

  <p>Recognizing the shape of the continent, Yudie knew that the place was not part of the Central Region. Nodding, she responded, "This is the Divine Kingdom Continent. It belongs to the human race."</p>

  <p>Yudie had never been to the Divine Kingdom Continent before, but she remembered that Zheng once mentioned that the continent's shape was very unique. In the middle of it was a continental sea, surrounded by the mainland. From above, it looked like the shape of a bracelet. This unique form made it easy for Yudie to ascertain it was indeed the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>"The divine kingdom?" Preston asked in surprise, a flash of disdain crossing his face.</p>

  <p>A divine kingdom could only exist in the Lower World, and because of that, there were no divine kingdoms existing in the Upper World. The forces, such as the Humanity Alliance and the Thoughtless Minds, would develop into countless tenth-grade sacred places in the end, forming an extremely large and formidable force.</p>

  <p>Actually, Janet's clan, Lucille's clan, Nathan's Clan, and Lawson's Clan were like four divine kingdoms; however, with the alliance of these four great clans, there was no more need to select an emperor to take charge of the Thoughtless Minds, which had successfully developed into an extremely powerful force.</p>

  <p>Those who possessed true strength didn't need to add the title of war king or war emperor to their names.</p>

  <p>They were already considered as the most powerful beings in the universe, and their names were spread out and known by everyone.</p>

  <p>Besides, the strongest warriors of the universe already had the title of Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have sealed those creatures with the Heaven Earth Sealing Skill, so it will take them some time before they can break the seal I placed upon them. Let's rest and recover our strengths first before we make any plans."</p>

  <p>A considerable number of core disciples from the Pure Jade Sacred Place followed Preston toward the ascending passageway. Although they were yet to be considered as talented and powerful warriors in the universe, they had more than enough potential to grow even stronger and become the main force of the Pure Jade Sacred Place in the future. Preston protected so many core disciples this time, which could be regarded as one of his great achievements in life.</p>

  <p>Had this occurred in the past, Preston would've felt overjoyed, but he couldn't find it in his heart to feel happy now. He was afraid that the Pure Jade Sacred Place might cease to exist soon, so he found his contribution, albeit great, meaningless.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, a figure from the continent below shot up to the skies at a rapid speed to greet him.</p>

  <p>The stranger was wearing a yellow robe, with an elegant and sophisticated dragon embroidered around the sleeves. Seeing the intricate details of his clothes, both Preston and Yudie figured out that this person was none other than the divine kingdom's ruler.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, I am Brennan Liu. I don't know why you have come to the York Divine Kingdom, but we will do our best to help you out no matter what it is!"</p>

  <p>Despite being the ruler of the York Divine Kingdom, Brennan chose to greet them with respect. He could detect the strength of the newcomers and knew that if he made the wrong move, they could easily wipe out his entire kingdom. But fortunately, these warriors were not interested in destroying the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>As this was the case, Brennan thought he might as well just treat them with courtesy. If they needed his help, he'd have no choice but to help.</p>

  <p>But on the off chances that he couldn't, he decided to just be honest with them and politely send them off.</p>

  <p>Preston kept his silence. Since Yudie hailed from this world, it was better and more fitting if she would manage this.</p>

  <p>"So this is the York Divine Kingdom... Salutations, I'm Yudie Ning, the leader of Cloud Hall in the Central Region," Yudie replied, bowing her head slightly.</p>

  <p>"The Central Region..." Brennan trailed off, his mind trying to process what she said. "You are Yudie from the Sky Northern Region?" he asked, his eyes widening as surprise flickered on his face.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had made his trip to the Divine Kingdom Continent, the four divine kingdoms had started to place more importance to the Central Region. When the Star Storm stopped, people from both continents went and visited each other.</p>

  <p>Due to the storm, it was not very convenient for the citizens to travel back and forth between continents, but the relationship between the people grew much closer than before.</p>

  <p>Wealthy merchants in the divine kingdoms even found business opportunities and took huge risks to cross the Chaotic Ocean of Stars in order to trade their goods. They set up a schedule for the construction of a space channel between the two continents to allow easier trading and more convenient travel between merchants.</p>

  <p>The current power of the Cloud Hall was already comparable to any of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Because of its esteemed reputation, it was natural for Brennan to know about the Cloud Hall's leader, Yudie.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that the leader of the Cloud Hall would also ascend. Not only that, she even brought thousand warriors of the Soul Sea Realm and an indistinguishable expert back with her. He tried to figure out her purpose and came up with one guess: they were probably being chased and decided to take refuge in his kingdom.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, there are powerful enemies chasing after us in the ascending passageway. If you will allow us, we wish to stay here for some time. We want to take some rest first before we formulate our new plan," Yudie said politely.</p>

  <p>Ah, so his guess was correct. Brennan pursed his lips and tried to think of his next course of actions. What should he do now? He knew it was dangerous and wanted them to leave quickly, but he was left with no choice.</p>

  <p>It seemed Yudie was a bit selfish...</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race members were indeed mysterious and frightening. If they were lured into the Central Region, they would no doubt bring trouble and incite chaos in the Cloud Hall. Thus Yudie decided to sacrifice the Divine Kingdom Continent instead. Brennan realized her selfish motives and felt anger rising in his chest, but he was helpless and he knew that he could do nothing against these powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>"Masters, this way, please," Brennan said, keeping his tone polite despite the maelstrom of emotions filling his chest.</p>

  <p>He even addressed them as powerful "masters", because that was how they usually called the strongest Soul Sea Realm warriors in their continent.</p>

  <p>The thousand warriors, including Yudie and Preston, followed him into the heart of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng, who was staying at the top of the Cloud Hall, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>When Zheng felt a strange phenomenon coming in from the great world, he immediately grasped the memories about Yudie.</p>

  <p>Yudie's memories on the will of the great world were cut off less than a year ago. As she had ascended at the time, she did not leave any memory mark on the will. But now that she was back, Zheng finally managed to capture the memories about her.</p>

  <p>There was only a small amount of memories about her as it had only recorded the part where Yudie entered the great world and conversed with Brennan, the ruler of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it was more than enough for Zheng to determine her location.</p>
