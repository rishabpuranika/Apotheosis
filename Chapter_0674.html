<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 674 Three Fat People (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The icy halberd on Yudie's hand made the atmosphere fiery. Her eyes began to flash light, ready to destroy anyone who would want to mess with her people. Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit showed no emotion on their faces as they moved forward. Each of them took a fighting position, and they together set a battle formation and drew their swords all at the same time.</p>

  <p>Leader of Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit asked in a tone of disbelief, "Ning Yudie, do you want war with Ethereal Spirit Sect?"</p>

  <p>"No, I want nothing but peace from you. But I have to protect Luo Zheng. He's a disciple of Cloud Hall," Ning Yudie said coldly, showing no emotions at all.</p>

  <p>Hearing Yudie's words, Luo Zheng was touched. He was very much unwilling to drag the Cloud Hall into war. He never meant to start it, and never meant to have anyone clean up his mess. He started this, and he should be the only one to end this. As touched as he might be from what Ning Yudie was showing him, he did not want anyone to be in trouble for defending him. He then thought of a plan that would settle this dispute by himself.</p>

  <p>"Cloud Hall has been developing well and rapidly over the past years. A lot of improvements have been made by you and your people. In ten years, I believe Cloud Hall will have an equal position with the Ethereal Spirit Sect," leader of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit announced. "But... Ning Yudie, you're overconfident and proud. If I were you, I would keep a low profile and keep my head down. Cloud Hall is going to pay for fighting with the Ethereal Spirit!" he added threateningly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool. I know Cloud Hall is looked down upon by Ethereal Spirit Sect. But don't think you can defeat us easily. You'll have to take Luo Zheng over my dead body. But you must have forgotten, there're more than dozens of sects in the Central Region. When you're weak because of our fight, I'm afraid that other sects may harbor malicious intentions towards you. By then, can you keep yourself and your sect safe?" Ning Yudie replied coldly and smugly. She did make a point.</p>

  <p>There had been a delicate, but beautiful balance between sects in the Central Region. No sect was a hundred percent sure that it could defeat all of other sects without itself being destroyed first. It was an unspoken truth.</p>

  <p>Even if Ethereal Spirit Sect could destroy the Could Hall first, it would be seriously weakened. With weakness oozing out of their sect, they would be hunted by the more power hungry ones, the fourth-grade sects. Ethereal Spirit Sect would end up with a more miserable destiny than the Could Hall.</p>

  <p>"Ning Yudie, I think you have some wrong ideas about us. If Ethereal Spirit Sect deigns to teach you a lesson, how will Bloodwood Cliff dare to take advantage of this and hurt Ethereal Spirit Sect?" Lady Poison-blood hastened to vow.</p>

  <p>Raven echoed and added, "I totally agree with Lady Poison-blood. Ethereal Spirit Sect has the full and complete support from Black Mountain Sect.</p>

  <p>We'll keep it safe. Black Mountain Sect and Ethereal Spirit Sect will be allies in the future."</p>

  <p>Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit were not naive, and didn't believe any words or vows from Raven or Lady Poison-blood. Warriors were connected by nothing but profits, gains and interests. To gain profits, both of them would break their promises without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Yudie's warning reminded Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit of the possible consequences of this fight between them. Their faces changed. They talked using their life vitality to avoid any words coming out of their mouths.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, their faces exuded assurance, and their concerns or doubts completely disappeared. Leader of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit shook his head and said, "Ning Yudie, there's no need for you to worry about the future of my sect. No matter who protects Luo Zheng, we'll take him. Whoever is protecting him is fighting a losing war."</p>

  <p>With those words, Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit changed their stance, and lights appeared beneath their feet, through which they were connected together. The shape of a glowing Big Dipper was formed around them.</p>

  <p>They raised their hands at the same time, with the exact same gesture and movement. They seemed to have become one existence.</p>

  <p>This vital battle was about to erupt. No matter who won, a general war between Cloud Hall and Ethereal Spirit Sect would still happen. The tension between the two sects was so visible that they could light a campfire when they crossed paths.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie didn't cower or retreat. She wielded her halberd bravely, and the icy lights began to coagulate around her body, giving her the protection against those possible shots from the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit.</p>

  <p>At this moment, three fat people appeared from out of nowhere and walked to them.</p>

  <p>They didn't fly or use martial arts. They were like regular people. They just simply walked up a long path of Oracle City, panting for breath. Their bodies were jiggling as they ran up to meet them.</p>

  <p>Those three fat guys had big and round head, more like bald. They had bellies as big as a pig's. They wore clothes with copper cash, and walked in such a funny way that you would think them as three clowns or some silly sons of a wealthy landlord. They were bouncing as they walked.</p>

  <p>Although all of them were fat, nobody would confuse them with one another. You could still tell them apart.</p>

  <p>The first fat guy seemed to be weak and lovely, with fair skin as smooth as silk, with eyes that would sparkle when you called his name. His eyelashes were so long, so full and so elegant.</p>

  <p>The second guy was dark skinned, and he looked like he was sun kissed. He had a fierce-looking face. He would look like a ferocious wild boar if he had a pair of tusks. Anyone who would meet him would initially be threatened and scared.</p>

  <p>As for the third guy, he had a fine color in his rosy cheeks, like he had so much joy in the world. He seemed to be as kind as a Maitreya Buddha, willing to do anything to help others. He had a smile plastered on his face wherever he went.</p>

  <p id="top"><a id="p3361" class="calibre2"></a>They were catching their breath from all the walking. After all, they weren't really physically fit.</p>

  <p>They stopped before the Dragon Soar Arena, extremely tired. Clearly, their huge bodies had been their great liabilities. Every step took them a lot of effort, making them sweat.</p>

  <p>The fat guy, with the lovely expression on his face, took several deep breaths and rested his arms on his hips, before saying, "Stop, stop!"</p>
