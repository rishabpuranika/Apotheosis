<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3761 The Earth Wood Seal </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The solidified ice was more stable than the last one, and on it were blue patterns.</p>

  <p>Hosea came out of the ice and didn't stop at all.</p>

  <p>In a split-second, he flew up high into the sky, and part of his limbs turned into an ice spear that was over ten thousand feet long!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Hosea spun his body around and the ice spear shot to the bald giant!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Although the ice spear was truly powerful, it failed to pierce through the bald giant's body.</p>

  <p>Hosea frowned when he realized that he couldn't injure the bald giant with his own strength. Thus, he floated up again and condensed a second ice spear.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>This time, the icy blue spear pierced through the bald giant's armpit.</p>

  <p>Then, Hosea condensed more ice spears immediately after. dozens of ice spears shuttled down from all directions and repeatedly punctured the bald giant until he was firmly fastened on the ground.</p>

  <p>Hosea then stopped when he felt that the bald giant was finally subdued.</p>

  <p>After he took a look at his work, his lips curved into a satisfied smile. Then, he slowly floated towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was a big hole in the upper ice field, which would take some time to repair itself.</p>

  <p>A cold wind blew across the whole ice city, which made the whole place's temperature drop sharply.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Li Bianxue and Phoenix also felt their hearts drop.</p>

  <p>For their safety, the two women didn't go down to the lower ice field with Luo Zheng and the bald giant. Besides, Phoenix had previously spent a lot of effort melting the ice for the bald giant to go down.</p>

  <p>The Divine Fire Shield covered the two women as they observed the situation from the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>"Eh, the bald giant is lame..." Li Bianxue said. "You shouldn't have let Luo Zheng make such a dangerous move!" She glared at Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Phoenix stayed silent for a moment before she said, "I did overestimate his strength..."</p>

  <p>Indeed, the bald giant was powerful when it came to strength and defense.</p>

  <p>Even the ice spears Hosea had thrown with all his might failed to cause even the slightest damage to the bald giant. So Hosea could only seal him.</p>

  <p>However, the bald giant didn't know how to kill Hosea either.</p>

  <p>He couldn't do anything to the ever-changing water spirit like Hosea.</p>

  <p>That was why when Luo Zheng saw Hosea float towards him, he automatically increased his guard.</p>

  <p>His strength was truly beyond Luo Zheng's expectations. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, is there any way to defeat this water spirit?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Even the Magical Thunder Slave he had encountered before couldn't be killed with brute force? but after the Primeval Lord of Heaven used the Imprisoning Lightning, he transformed into another form and became easy to kill.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that in the whole human race and even among the civilizations on the Other Shore, the Primeval Lord of Heaven probably knew the Element Spirit Civilization best. He had his way of restraining the Five-Element Spirits.</p>

  <p>"The Five-Element Spirits don't have forms, which makes it hard to kill them, but after a long time of being in conflicts with them, the civilizations that insisted on the Finale Way finally came up with some methods."</p>

  <p>Back then, the civilizations that believed in the Finale Way had also privately exchanged methods on how to deal with the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The water spirits did not have a form, but that didn't mean that they were completely flawless. The most common method against them was fire attacks.</p>

  <p>They could be burned and sealed with strong fire until their forms completely disappeared, then they died. "Could you possibly use such a method?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"We're just energy souls. My previous attacks relied on the Civilization Artifact, so I can't fight against a water spirit at the Eternal Realm with my energy soul," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>If the real God of Fire, Zhurong was with them, he could fight Hosea with the fire attack. Still, the fire the energy soul of Zhurong released wasn't enough to threaten Hosea.</p>

  <p>"But there is another method," the Primeval Lord of Heaven continued. "It is somewhat similar to the Imprisoning Lighting. You need to transform the water spirit into another form, then kill him. This way is called the Earth Wood Seal, but it's also very difficult to seal Hosea. Most importantly, you need to be strong enough to kill him after you seal him," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.</p>

  <p>As the Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke, the human race's book began to turn over, and a triangular rune flew out from a particular page.</p>

  <p>On the top of the rune was a water-shaped pattern, and on both sides of the bottom were earth and wood-shaped patterns.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng, who was now a little desperate, heard those words, his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Even if the Primeval Lord of Heaven felt that it was hard for Luo Zheng to resist, the Earth Wood Seal would still give him a chance to counterattack!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was still communicating with the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Hosea was already in front of him. At the same time, he raised the blades in his hands, as if he was going to chop Luo Zheng's head at any time. "I'll give you one last chance. How did you understand the bald giant's language?" he hissed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze crossed Hosea as he stared at the bald giant behind him.</p>

  <p>Even though the bald giant was sealed and unable to move, his eyes were still flexible. His angry red eyes were still visible through the dark blue ice.</p>

  <p>The bald giant had just escaped from the Cold Prison, but Hosea froze him just now. Everyone could only imagine how angry he was.</p>

  <p>Anger could make him stronger.</p>

  <p>The bald giant had once mentioned to Luo Zheng their source of strength.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, Hosea's ice seal might not be able to seal the bald giant in the end.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng thought quickly and made a decision.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if the bald giant could break through ice around him, but at that point, Luo Zheng couldn't do anything but delay things and give the bald giant more time to break through the ice!</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, please give me the Earth Wood Seal!" Luo Zheng communicated to his inner world. Of course, the Primeval Lord of Heaven did not hesitate.</p>

  <p>He extended his hand and gently pointed at the triangle rune. The triangle rune spun a few times, then it turned into a golden beam of light and flew towards the sky!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Once the rune was out from his inner world, Luo Zheng held it in his hand.</p>

  <p>When he saw that Hosea had gotten a little impatient, he immediately said,</p>

  <p>"Because I've deciphered his language!"</p>

  <p>"Deciphered his language?" Hosea narrowed his eyes in doubt.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization had also tried to do this before.</p>

  <p>However, the bald giant's language was very complicated, and every enunciation could mean multiple things.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization was not as good as the Calculation Civilization in calculation. It would probably take them a long time to decipher the language after taking so many possibilities into account.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization was also aware of it. That was one of the reasons why they froze the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization!</p>

  <p>The green figure had previously told Luo Zheng that the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't destroy the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. But in fact, they could do this if they wanted.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the Element Spirit Civilization just wanted to control the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization at the right time, so they naturally didn't want to destroy it.</p>
