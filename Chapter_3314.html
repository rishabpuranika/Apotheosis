<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3314 The Green Jade Beast </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The human girl shook the blood away from her hands, the red streams painting the ground. Then, she checked them under the light, and a satisfied grin stretched on her lips.</p>

  <p>Next, she jerked her fat legs, which caused the skin to crack. The flesh began to roll upwards to reveal a pair of slender legs.</p>

  <p>Her shoulders, chest, and waist followed suit. Her thick limbs were stripped from her original body as a tangy, bloody scent filled the dark cave.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a perfectly shaped body emerged from the pile of flesh.</p>

  <p>Although she was still quite confused, she seemed to be in a better mood as her snow-white feet moved across the dark and bloody cave.</p>

  <p>As she moved, the light column that came from the valley also moved with her.</p>

  <p>The properties of the tombstone and the soil around it had changed with the birth of the purified being. They did not belong to the Dark Region anymore, so the light couldn't damage them.</p>

  <p>The materials outside the light column, however, were different: as long as they touched the light, their energy and the light column's energy would attempt to eliminate each other.</p>

  <p>As the light column started to move, numerous ditches appeared in the ground because of the erosion. The light column almost hit some of the pig-faced monsters that were in the middle of worshipping. The ground trembled as all of them scampered to the edge of the valley to hide, and then proceeded to watch the scene with caution.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Has the light column moved?"</p>

  <p>"It's Master Teague! Has Master Teague turned into a purified being?"</p>

  <p>All the pig-faced monsters that knew about the situation were aware that the light column did not illuminate the tomb, nor the tombstone, but Master Teague.</p>

  <p>Once Master Teague became a purified being, the light column would follow him wherever he went!</p>

  <p>Since the light column shifted around, it was obvious that Master Teague was awake.</p>

  <p>All of them saw how the brightness followed him as he walked in the dark cave.</p>

  <p>"If Master Teague has succeeded, why won't he leave the dark cave?" The dark blue pig-faced monster scowled. "Maybe he needs to get everything ready," the pig-faced monster next to it replied and burst into giggles.</p>

  <p>"It is said that a purified being can give us the ability to leave the darkness, right?" another pig-faced monster asked, its tone full of expectation. The dark blue pig-faced monster nodded and said, "According to what I heard, yes, but it's not permanent."</p>

  <p>"It's still better than spending the whole life in the Dark Region," the other pig-faced monster exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>The light column kept moving, which caused the ditches in the ground to run deeper and deeper.</p>

  <p>Finally, it returned to its original position and remained still.</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters thought that Master Teague was about to show up, so they all knelt on the ground and waited respectfully.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the octopuses had again thrown Luo Zheng into the deep area of the black pool behind the valley.</p>

  <p>He had been thrown there for so many times that it could be said that he was even used to it.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Bugs were highly poisonous to other living creatures, but not to Luo Zheng. He only felt like he was being poked hundreds of times. At the very least, he didn't die.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know, however, was there were more than just the Green Jade Bugs that lived in the black pool!</p>

  <p>"Something is wrong today... Where are those bugs?"</p>

  <p>His face twisted with an unreadable expression as he floated quietly atop the pool's inky depths.</p>

  <p>Five minutes had passed, and as things had been the past few days, those Green Jade Bugs should have swarmed him by now. Yet, it was exceptionally quiet. There wasn't even a single Green Jade Bug on his body.</p>

  <p>'Did I get too many of them these days and they are now extinct?' he thought. Just as his imagination had run wild, he felt a wave in the thick black pool.</p>

  <p>His heart began to pound loudly in his chest.</p>

  <p>The black pool was so viscous that he could hardly move freely in it.</p>

  <p>With such a strong wave, he was afraid that it might've come from a gigantic creature with unfathomable powers?</p>

  <p>'Don't come at me!' he prayed fervently in his heart.</p>

  <p>The wave in the black pool grew increasingly stronger until his heartbeat rang in his ears. Under the pool was indeed a gigantic creature, and it silently approached him.</p>

  <p>He began to understand why the Green Jade Bugs had stopped attacking him. They were probably avoiding the gigantic creature.</p>

  <p>"Grmmm..."</p>

  <p>The wave suddenly stopped coming, and a pulling force tugged at him from the front. Luo Zheng felt like he had been sucked into a gigantic beast's mouth, which he was. Once he was inside of it, the beast swam downwards and dragged the bronze iron plates along with it.</p>

  <p>At that point, the octopuses by the black pool had simultaneously grasped at the rope on the bronze plates firmly with their tentacles. When they felt that the plates had sunk, they began to pull the rope upwards.</p>

  <p>The octopuses were so powerful that even Luo Zheng stood no chance against their force.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the gigantic beast in the black pool was not weak either.</p>

  <p>It desperately dragged Luo Zheng into the depths of the pool and soon enough, the two parties began to fight each other.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng felt utterly helpless in the beast's big mouth. His situation allowed him no room to resist.</p>

  <p>Still, he strongly hoped that the octopuses could pull him ashore. After all, it was better to be treated as a bait than to be eaten alive.</p>

  <p>The tug of war continued for a while, until the octopuses suddenly exerted their full strength. Luo Zheng felt that he was dragged upwards and rushed out of the black pool.</p>

  <p>It was still dark around him since he was inside the big mouth, but he definitely felt that he was on his way up!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The pulling went on until the gigantic beast collided with the mountain, and the heavy impact caused it to spat Luo Zheng out.</p>

  <p>A sharp pain ripped through his body as he landed. He immediately crawled up with the bronze iron plates still on his body. Then he was greeted by the ugly sight of the beast.</p>

  <p>The gigantic beast had an incomparably big mouth and two wings. Its entire body was a cyan hue that was as smooth as grease, as if it had been carved from a chunk of jade. However, it was a living gigantic beast, aptly named the Green Jade Beast.</p>

  <p>"Grrr..."</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Beast lowered its head and roared.</p>

  <p>Things quickly took an unexpected turn when instead of targeting Luo Zheng, it flew towards the nearest octopus.</p>

  <p>The octopuses shrieked in horror when they realized that they were no match for the gigantic beast. Thus, they quickly withdrew their tentacles and ran towards the valley.</p>

  <p>Even though they moved in high speeds, the beast had caught up to the last octopus and crushed it. Then, it began to bite the creature's body until it was torn into pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been hanging from the tentacles of the last octopus. Now that it was nothing but chunks of meat, it couldn't take him back to the valley.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Beast chewed some more until it swallowed the whole octopus in a few gulps, and then it turned to look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The beast's terrifying stare sent chills down Luo Zheng's spine. In a moment of desperation, he gathered all his strength and rolled down the mountain with the bronze iron plates. The mountain was steep, so he was able to roll down rather quickly. Although the bumpy ride injured him along the way, it was still better than being eaten by the beast!</p>

  <p>When the beast saw that its target had escaped, a fierce light flashed in its eyes. It wasted no time and followed Luo Zheng all the way down!</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters were still kneeling before their purified being.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they heard a loud noise from above and saw that the octopuses had fled back to the triangular caves. It was as if they were escaping from something, which astonished the pig-faced monsters.</p>
