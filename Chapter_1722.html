<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1722 The Weird Spear </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>None of the top ten warriors in the Illusion Battlefield showed any weakness.</p>

  <p>Their strength, cultivation methods, skills, and speed all reached the peak of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>If they showed even a hint of a weak point, their opponent would seize the chance to bring them down.</p>

  <p>It was just like Cindy's dream� while she was almost invincible in her dream, her own strength wasn't that remarkable.</p>

  <p>When the dream was broken, she would be left like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.</p>

  <p>Nathan's physical body was not as tough as Zheng's, but it was extremely tenacious. After taking Zheng's punch head-on, he didn't get hurt at all.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Nathan was stunned as he fell onto the board. But just then, as if an idea suddenly came to him, a satisfied smile surfaced on his face.</p>

  <p>"I really shouldn't be speaking nonsense with you here," Nathan said as he shook his head. "Things like fate shouldn't be announced, to begin with. Time can prove it well enough. Maybe the fate displayed on the board can only be verified after many years. But things like your defeat�I can verify that immediately."</p>

  <p>With that, Nathan's Mu Ning gradually changed.</p>

  <p>He held his spear casually as he took slow steps toward Luo Zheng from the edge of the board.</p>

  <p>Every time he took a step forward, his Mu Ning seemed to increase. It was as if there was something invisible attached to his body.</p>

  <p>Although he walked slowly, his actual speed was by no means slow. If one took a closer look, they would see that after taking every step, he'd somehow glide along the board as if he were walking on ice.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's eyes, Nathan was a giant approaching.</p>

  <p>While he wasn't as tall as a giant, his powerful Mu Ning made him seem like he towered over everyone.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's previous battle, he possessed the cross crystal, and his Mu Ning was akin to that of a True God. But his suppressive force was applied only to the Godly Geniuses on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>But Nathan was different.</p>

  <p>When his Mu Ning suddenly increased, it could even affect the people outside the picture.</p>

  <p>Outside the bounds of the picture stroll, countless martial artists stared at Nathan, dumbfounded. Under the suppression of his Mu Ning, their hearts began racing.</p>

  <p>But even though the Mu Ning was strong, its influence was still limited.</p>

  <p>Before such a majestic Mu Ning, Spirit Transformation Realm martial artists only felt some pressure.</p>

  <p>When the many world lords faced this Mu Ning, their faces revealed only a trace of confusion. They were puzzled by how Nathan, a Soul Sea Realm warrior, managed to even slightly shake their state of mind.</p>

  <p>From the moment he entered the Heaven Earth Board, Nathan hadn't yet displayed his full strength.</p>

  <p>The opponents he faced had either been sent flying by his punch or crushed by his palm strike. Even against Kurt, Nathan didn't get the chance to unleash his full strength because of Kurt's wise decision to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>But Nathan knew that the guy in front of him had no intention of admitting defeat.</p>

  <p>He was then left with a single choice� he had to use even stronger power to make his opponent understand what his name, Nathan Xuanyuan, stood for.</p>

  <p>Facing the approaching Nathan, Luo Zheng grew more and more cautious. The chaotic sea also began surging as chaotic energy began gathering around Zheng's sword light like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>In the exchange between the two, Luo Zheng clearly had the upper hand. But in a battle of this level, such an advantage was meaningless. The tables could turn at any moment.</p>

  <p>The most troublesome thing at the moment was that he failed to see through Nathan's ability.</p>

  <p>To defeat Tianming, Luo Zheng had already used all his trump cards. But Nathan's display of ability was only the tip of the iceberg� most of it was still hidden underwater.</p>

  <p>Pak!</p>

  <p>When Nathan closed the distance to a certain point, he stepped onto a stone. Suddenly, his body shot right at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The spear was like a flood dragon that had just left its lair. Under Nathan's rapid thrusting, the spear shaft bent and pierced at Luo Zheng in a unique path.</p>

  <p>"This is the spear!"</p>

  <p>Kurt exclaimed as he stared at Nathan, taking a deep breath.</p>

  <p>With the help of his Constellation Eyes, he saw the spear strike that shook his very Buddhist spirit to the core.</p>

  <p>Even now, he couldn't wrap his head around it.</p>

  <p>How could Nathan attack with such a strike?</p>

  <p>Kurt admitted that there was a difference in strength between him and Nathan, but he didn't think the gap was that great. What kind of Godly Way did Nathan train in?</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Kurt had no idea that Luo Zheng was feeling exactly the same way.</p>

  <p>This was the first of Nathan's strikes that he had taken seriously.</p>

  <p>In this situation, Luo Zheng felt as if he was on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>If the spear were to pierce him, he believed that not only his life would dissipate, even his soul would be destroyed. His warrior spirit would collapse along with it.</p>

  <p>What a powerful spear strike!</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart began trembling uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>The first thing he did was retreat.</p>

  <p>After making the forceful energy explode, he simultaneously circulated the Eight Smoky Melodies, rapidly moving backward. The move wasn't exactly elegant� it was actually rather awkward, but he wasn't left with any other choice.</p>

  <p>The spear didn't contain any internal momentum, nor did it contain much skill. So why was it so powerful? As Luo Zheng retreated, the gears in his head got to work.</p>

  <p>Just then, Nathan's spear missed its target.</p>

  <p>But a purple spear light somehow erupted from the tip of the spear just as it missed, extending and following closely behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The spear light followed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'This spear light� It gives me the same feeling!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>It was an extension of the spear� its power wasn't considered something strong.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng would have been able to block it with ease in a single sword strike. He could have stood at the same spot and let the spear light come at him without a problem.</p>

  <p>But now, he had a feeling.</p>

  <p>If the spear light hit him, he would end up dead as well.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>As he retreated, a cyan sword intent shot out like a beam of light, striking that very spear light.</p>

  <p>Normally, the Gods-intimidating Strike activated by chaotic energy was much more powerful than Nathan's spear light. Based on Zheng's experience, this sword light could corrode the spear light and shoot right at Nathan.</p>

  <p>But the next scene had Luo Zheng stunned.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As the sword light collided with the spear light, a small crack appeared on the sword light's surface.</p>

  <p>The crack came as quite a surprise.</p>

  <p>Although the sword light had color, it was technically a cyan light reflected after the sword intent was condensed.</p>

  <p>But the sword light didn't have a form� it was merely a ray of light.</p>

  <p>Just like a mass of air� an extraordinarily powerful mass of air.</p>

  <p>Who had ever heard of the air breaking?</p>

  <p>But the scene before him was real.</p>

  <p>As the cracks spread out, the sword light released by the Gods-intimidating Strike instantly cracked and disintegrated.</p>

  <p>Lawson's lips curled into a cold smile. He couldn't help but begin laughing like the roar of a wild beast. "Haha! Luo Zheng must be in the middle of a nervous breakdown right now."</p>

  <p>A fiery light flashed in Tianming's eyes as his expression turned solemn.</p>

  <p>"What a tyrannical spear art! It actually shattered the sword light!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng's sword light was actually shattered?!"</p>

  <p>"But it's a beam of light. How can that be shattered?"</p>

  <p>"There will always be mysteries in this universe that we cannot understand. We must learn to respect them."</p>

  <p>While 99% of people in the entire universe had already seen this strange phenomenon, no one was sure of what it meant.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>After the spear light shattered Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike, it continued to rush towards him.</p>

  <p>And at this moment, Luo Zheng didn't hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>If he hesitated for even a moment, he would have been easily struck by the spear light and split into two.</p>

  <p>"Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>It was an enhanced version of the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>While it was Zheng's strongest strike, it was only used to counter this unremarkable purple spear light.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The boundless chaotic energy then fused with the Metal Law and surged up once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword strike should be enough to offset a thousand purple spear lights.</p>

  <p>This sword strike that mixed with chaotic energy shot out before colliding with the spear light. In an instant, another explosion resounded in Zheng's ears.</p>

  <p>Pak!</p>

  <p>Another unimaginable crack appeared on the sword light.</p>

  <p>Then, it dissipated.</p>

  <p>Once again, the wisp of purple spear light shot out from Zheng's sword light and continued pressing toward him as if it were a ghost from hell, continuing to bite down on Luo Zheng without the slightest hint of dispersing.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As it shot over, Luo Zheng tilted his head to the side at a crucial moment. The purple spear light grazed right past his ear, piercing his earlobe.</p>

  <p>But just then, Luo Zheng heard another crack.</p>

  <p>This time, the explosive sound came from his very own body.</p>
