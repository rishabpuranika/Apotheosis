  <p>
</p>

  <p>The shadow of Snake Goddess was a unique bloodline token of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Most of the members had the capability of exerting this token, but the power levels varied depending on the purity of their blood. The purer the blood, the more powerful the skill.</p>

  <p>Yan's shadow of Snake Goddess, for example, was at the highest level owing to her purer blood while Natalie's was lower in level.</p>

  <p>So when the Evil God used the shadow of Snake Goddess, it immediately attracted everybody's attention.</p>

  <p>"That can't be! Is that the shadow of Snake Goddess?"</p>

  <p>"That's our unique bloodline token? How is he able to use it? He's not one of our kind!"</p>

  <p>"What kind of ability is this?"</p>

  <p>Yan could only stare at the Evil God, not quite comprehending what was currently happening.</p>

  <p>While everyone was still in a state of shock, the Evil God's body began to change again.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched as his body trembled and his bones morphed into something else. Two heads sprouted out of his shoulders while four arms grew on his back.</p>

  <p>"Three heads and six arms?"</p>

  <p>"Is that the bloodline token of the Nine Li race?"</p>

  <p>"What's going on here?"</p>

  <p>Sally's face paled when she witnessed the three heads and the six arms of the Evil God. "How did he do that? He's not a member of the Nine Li race," she murmured in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have the ability to acquire other people's bloodline token,"</p>

  <p>Chaim told her, having figured it out a little bit. "I think he got this ability after making this strange world descend. Since the Evil God copied Mount's skill and also used the Grand Teleportation, that means Mount could freely ignore the spatial restrictions of the Chaotic Source World because of his bloodline token."</p>

  <p>Chaim's explanations made sense and Sally couldn't help but be impressed with how observant he had been.</p>

  <p>However, he was also clever enough to figure out another secret.</p>

  <p>"If he was able to have three heads and six arms, then that means there are members of the Nine Li race with us in this space," Chaim continued.</p>

  <p>Sally couldn't help but frown at Chaim's words.</p>

  <p>Since he was able to see it, those outside the Chaotic Source World might also come up with this conclusion.</p>

  <p>There was no way to hide their identity as members of the Nine Li race anymore.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God finished his transformation, the six fists he had clenched tightly and let out a burst of golden light. This blinding light enveloped him and began to change his body once more.</p>

  <p>Those from the Separate Abyss race were busy avoiding the attacks from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. However, the golden light that suddenly bathed the Evil God's body made them all stop. Surprise and bewilderment showed on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Golden Metal Transformation?"</p>

  <p>"That's the supreme bloodline token of our Separate Abyss race!"</p>

  <p>"Hamzah was the only one in the team who was able to apply this token.</p>

  <p>How in the world did this guy get it?"</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race's bloodline token was special. It was divided into three stages, each with totally different powers.</p>

  <p>Activating this power transformed the body and made one's flesh and bone much stronger.</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race managed to bring out a thousand Jun of power by simply relying on this bloodline token alone.</p>

  <p>The first stage of this bloodline token was the Purple Metal Transformation, followed by the Melting Metal Transformation, and ended with the peak Golden Metal Transformation. Only a handful of people reached the third stage since the flesh and blood suitable for utilizing this skill belonged to the noblest lineage in the Separate Abyss race. Hamzah was the only one in the team that was qualified to use it.</p>

  <p>So how in the world did the Evil God, a warrior obviously not from their race, use it?</p>

  <p>As the Evil God continued to activate more bloodline theurgies, Mount's face became grimmer and grimmer.</p>

  <p>Never in his life did he ever expect that he would face such a powerful warrior. The Evil God truly represented a strong ruling civilization on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The golden abacus floated beside him and the number it displayed was very small: one three-thousandth of a divine megaton. There was no way to fight with such little Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>"This is going to be troublesome..."</p>

  <p>Mount murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>He had previously found out that Luo Zheng was incredibly hard to deal with.</p>

  <p>Having found himself faced against a strong opponent, Mount could only delete Luo Zheng and the space he was in.</p>

  <p>In the entire Chaotic Source World, Luo Zheng had been the most threatening creature of all.</p>

  <p>To his surprise and abject horror, the moment Luo Zheng was sent away, an even more troublesome guy appeared.</p>

  <p>Mount could only look on as the bloodline theurgies continued to express themselves onto the Evil God's body, making his aura grow stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>Some of the bloodline theurgies he exhibited enhanced the body while others gave him strength, speed, and even more powerful abilities.</p>

  <p>As the bloodline theurgies merged within him, the Evil God got one step closer to full invincibility.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>An emperor's aura began to emanate from the Evil God. Even the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had to stop and maintain a distance from him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the atmosphere outside the Chaotic Source World remained tense.</p>

  <p>Leaders of various races sported identical grim expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>While they were competing for the Chaotic Source Spirits, the Evil God suddenly appeared and began exhibiting such horrifying abilities. They were envious of him, but also felt deeply concerned about the members of their races.</p>

  <p>"I hope he can restrain himself," a leader of the Bearing race muttered.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Phoenix spoke, suddenly having thought of something.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Divine Farmer race gave her a look.</p>

  <p>"This guy is able to borrow everyone's bloodline token, so does that mean there are members of the Nine Li race in the world he created? Those three heads and six arms are definitely from the Nine Li race's bloodline token!" Phoenix commented seriously.</p>

  <p>Several other leaders nodded in agreement, finding her observation valid.</p>

  <p>The complexities of this current situation made them almost miss such an important detail.</p>

  <p>"It is my honor to obtain so many bloodline theurgies! It's unfortunate that they're only temporary. So disappointing..." The Evil God shook his head regretfully. "Therefore, I will let you all sleep forever in this world so that I can have these bloodline theurgies forever!"</p>

  <p>He let out a roaring laugh before disappearing from where he stood.</p>

  <p>When he disappeared, Mount also vanished in his spot, making the Evil God miss his target.</p>

  <p>The two continued to dodge each other's attacks, disappearing and reappearing here and there as their fight continued.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Mount did most of the dodging. The Evil God was so good at throwing his offensive attacks that Mount had no time to throw one of his own.</p>

  <p>"Such power! I don't think he'll ever be suppressed by anyone at this point, not even Luo Zheng..." Chaim murmured.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had made himself clear.</p>

  <p>Whatever unique bloodline token it was, the Evil God could copy it so long as anyone with that token was in this world.</p>

  <p>However, if the owner of the token was killed, then it would become his permanently.</p>

  <p>Having obtained the acute sensibility of the Ear Mouse race, the Evil God even foresaw Mount's planned moves and attacks.</p>

  <p>As he dodged the continuous attacks from his formidable opponent, Mount suddenly thought of a solution that could turn the tides.</p>

  <p>His eyes fell on Yan.</p>

  <p>He knew he could only rely on that person's strength now.</p>

  <p>Yan was a very important person for the Li Shan mountain, so Mount trapped her in the cage so that she would be safe.</p>

  <p>If he released her from that cage and put her in the line of danger, then that person would surely take action.</p>
