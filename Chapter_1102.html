<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1102 The Little Monster </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Logan escaped from the void, Luo Zheng came out as well.</p>

  <p>The counterattack that Logan had launched was useless. Luo Zheng used his No Move skill to easily divert the Space Chopping Sword.</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, Luo Zheng threw out a strong punch.</p>

  <p>"Plink!"</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>Those moves from Luo Zheng suppressed Logan to a point where he had no chance to fight back. He had become weak.</p>

  <p>With that punch, Logan's armor wore out some more. It was now covered with cracks as if it could break apart at any given moment.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, Logan was one of those people who refused to admit defeat before their death. He would rather die than wave the white flag.</p>

  <p>"Plink!"</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>In a situation where both sides' strength was equal, it was usually the martial artist with a more powerful will who won.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, when the difference in strength was too great, willpower could become insignificant.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>After that particular punch, a sound like glazed tiles breaking was heard.</p>

  <p>Logan's space armor could no longer withstand the attack and shattered with a loud bang. Zheng's fist landed directly on Logan's unprotected chest.</p>

  <p>A huge force passed through Zheng's fist and hit Logan in the chest. Like a falling meteor, Logan's body heavily smashed downwards.</p>

  <p>The two of them had been fighting in the void and had already moved outside the enchanted barrier. Without the barrier, Logan had smacked into the square. As the martial artists below dodged, he crashed into the ground, creating a huge crater.</p>

  <p>Due to the strong winds, the rising dust was blown away like smoke.</p>

  <p>Logan's motionless body lay flat in the huge pit. No one knew whether he was dead or alive.</p>

  <p>All of the divine-level talents of the four divine kingdoms stared blankly at him. It took them a while to accept his current condition, given his display of strength and might before that very fight against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A few divine-level talents from the Harlen and Star Field Divine Kingdoms had been defeated by Logan. Moreover, his words had affected a lot of martial artists. He was extremely talented, yet quite modest. He had all the qualifications of a warrior who everybody looked up to.</p>

  <p>He was unrivaled among the warriors in the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and many divine-level talents could attest to that fact.</p>

  <p>But now, his space armor had been forcefully shattered by Zheng's power.</p>

  <p>He was like a dead animal lying in the pit, and it was safe to say that he had suffered a crushing defeat.</p>

  <p>"Great! Marvelous!" Turner exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Under Logan's suppression, Harlen Divine Kingdom had suffered a lot of humiliation. Although it didn't have an advantage in the past years, the talents of the divine kingdom were still able to compete with the others.</p>

  <p>It had never been defeated so miserably before.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had saved its reputation. Whether he came from the Harlen Divine Kingdom or not, he passed the Jade Martial House's assessment to become their representative.</p>

  <p>That was a timely victory.</p>

  <p>Beaming with immense pride and joy, Randy didn't need to say anything.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's help, his father could be very pleased. Since he was a fair man, Randy's position in his heart should rise up.</p>

  <p>In the midst of an early celebration, someone was very unhappy.</p>

  <p>Lightly, Marine's body flashed. She turned into a streak of green light that flew across the plaza and into the large crater. Then, she took out a white medicinal pill from her pouch and stuffed it into Logan's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Holy Maiden, is he alright?" War Emperor York asked, his face gloomy.</p>

  <p>The life of a Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist didn't bother him one bit. However, as the ruler of York Divine Kingdom, he had to show his concern in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>"His insides have been shattered," Marine said softly while shaking her head. She then coldly looked at Luo Zheng, who was in the sky, and said, "Little monster, fight for me! Kill him!"</p>

  <p>Since Marine had an outstanding position in their kingdom, she could select candidates to represent her in battles.</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, Luo Zheng was slightly surprised. Little monster? Who was he?</p>

  <p>At that point, a shrill voice suddenly rang out, "According to the rules, York Divine Kingdom can't send anyone to battle during this round!"</p>

  <p>It should be Star Field or Wind Divine Kingdom which would send out their fighter. Marine initially knew so, but she was too angry to think and act straight.</p>

  <p>It pissed her off, but rules were rules. Through gritted teeth, she retorted,</p>

  <p>"Let's wait for the next round, then!"</p>

  <p>It seemed like Luo Zheng was the only one who didn't have a clue who the little monster was. The others knew exactly who the person was.</p>

  <p>Randy was stunned. He hadn't expected Marine to be so furious as to send the little monster to fight on her behalf. 'If it happens, will Luo Zheng be able to withstand it this time?' Randy thought to himself.</p>

  <p>On the plaza, a thin warrior was sleeping soundly. Unlike the others, he was too enamored with his slumber to care about the battles.</p>

  <p>Not once did he open his eyes to watch the battles in the sky. It was as if everything that went down around him had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>However, after Marine spoke, he suddenly woke up. There were no whites in his eyes. His eyeballs were pitch black underneath his lids, like two black holes. He looked rather strange.</p>

  <p>That person was the little monster whom Marine had spoken of.</p>

  <p>"Marine, you really want me to represent you?" the little monster giggled. His body was extremely peculiar. How he moved was unfamiliar to everyone who had witnessed it. However, in just a blink of an eye, he was right beside Marine.</p>

  <p>It was a huge taboo to address her by her name in front of so many people.</p>

  <p>Marine was the Holy Maiden of the secret sect. Although she hailed from the York Divine Kingdom, her influence spread throughout the entire continent.</p>

  <p>There were no boundaries to religion. Using the power of the Upper World, the secret sect had accepted their followers within the four divine kingdoms. That was also the reason why Marine enjoyed such a high status even though she wasn't strong enough.</p>

  <p>Even War Emperor York himself didn't call her by her first name.</p>

  <p>Instead, he addressed her as the Holy Maiden. However, that little monster just didn't care.</p>

  <p>Marine glared at the little monster. If she had any other choice, she really didn't want this fellow to fight in her stead.</p>

  <p>Within the four divine kingdoms, there were countless martial houses.</p>

  <p>Nine Furnace Martial House was regarded to be the biggest one in the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>The little monster was the strongest cultivator from the Nine Furnace Martial House.</p>

  <p>As proud as Logan was, he never dared challenge the little monster.</p>

  <p>The little monster was powerful and unkind. He killed the innocent and indulged in all kinds of debauchery. He killed women after taking advantage of their bodies. In the past few years, at least eight hundred women had died at his hands.</p>

  <p>As the Holy Maiden, Marine definitely didn't get a free pass. She was hit on by the little monster more than once.</p>

  <p>He was not lusting after her beauty at all, but was purely interested in her identity as the Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>If it were any other cultivator who showed the slightest bit of evil intentions towards Marine, he would die miserably. Nobody could desecrate the Holy Maiden of the secret sect.</p>

  <p>However, the little monster was an exception. Once, he openly said that if there was a chance, he definitely wanted Marine to be one of his concubines. As soon as Marine heard his words, she was enraged. The little monster was the most obscene, but she still wasn't able to do anything to him.</p>

  <p>As the number one martial house of the Divine Kingdom Continent, Nine Furnace Martial House was already close to the level of a seventh-grade sect, and the little monster was simply too important to them.</p>

  <p>His importance wasn't the measure of his strength. That wasn't the case.</p>

  <p>After all, he was only at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>He didn't stand a chance against any mighty warrior of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>The Nine Furnace Martial House did not lack Life and Death Realm and Soul Sea Realm experts, but they still needed the little monster. It was because of him that the York Divine Kingdom had been so prosperous and the younger generation of martial artists had progressed so fast in the last thirty years.</p>

  <p>He possessed an extremely special talent.</p>

  <p>A battle against the little monster was transcendental. Any martial artist that went against him easily fell into a state of epiphany.</p>

  <p>If a divine-level talent of the Virtual Tribulation Realm was stuck in a bottleneck, breaking through was a walk in the park when he fought with the little monster.</p>

  <p>In addition, the little monster's talent was not only effective for Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists. Possible, it could also work for the experts from both Life and Death and Soul Sea Realms.</p>

  <p>Relatively, the stronger the martial artist was, the weaker the effect was going to be. When one was at the same level as War Emperor York, the effect was minute.</p>

  <p>No matter what, almost all of the martial artists were drawn to the little monster's magical skill. Even though he was an awful creature by nature, all of the Nine Furnace Martial House still treated him like God.</p>

  <p>Many of the Soul Sea Realm experts in the four divine kingdoms also planned to train the little monster. Currently, he was only at the late stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm, and his talent didn't have much impact on the Soul Sea Realm experts. But, what if he were to be cultivated to the Soul Sea Realm?</p>
