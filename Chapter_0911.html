<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Cave was illuminated by the Dark Nether Death Light all year round. To be able to grow under such harsh conditions, creatures that reproduced there must be stronger than those creatures outside the cave. It was an endless battle for the survival of the fittest.</p>

  <p>The grass surrounding some areas of the cave seemed to have a unique way of existing on the grounds. After being stomped on by countless footsteps, they immediately swayed back like nothing happened. They even had blade-like leaves, almost as if to defend themselves from other creatures' attacks. The grass leaves were thin enough to cut an ordinary mysterious weapon. If one wasn't careful enough, they could cause serious injuries.</p>

  <p>If ordinary and powerless creatures graced through these grasses, they could die. They could bleed to death even before they managed to get out.</p>

  <p>This sort of danger didn't alarm the top-level war lords. The harm that the grass could cause could never penetrate through their protective life vitality.</p>

  <p>Gracefully moving forward, Esther led the way.</p>

  <p>Following right behind her was Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>A few of the Night Group members hid their breaths and swiftly moved around like ghosts.</p>

  <p>"What we see right before us is the Bloody Pass. Everyone, please remove all of your life vitality and forceful energy and do not make any sound,"</p>

  <p>Esther said softly.</p>

  <p>"The Bloody Pass?" From afar, Zheng was able to make out two small mountains, forming a specific angle. A path could be seen between them, which was the so-called Bloody Pass. It baffled them all however, why they had to take off their protection techniques.</p>

  <p>"There are two powerful monster lairs on the two sides of the Bloody Pass.</p>

  <p>One is the Azure Wolf, and the other is the Swallowing Bird, the strange bird we saw before. While passing through, we must completely be silent.</p>

  <p>Even the sound of our breaths can put us in danger," Fabian said, after which he took out a cloak from his space ring and covered himself with it.</p>

  <p>Despite the inability to understand the entire point of such action, the rest of the party did the same and then covered themselves with their cloaks.</p>

  <p>Unlike Zheng, everyone else didn't have the capability to resist the effects of the red light. The Dark Nether Death Light had indeed weakened, but its power could cause extreme discomfort to the victim. Not being able to avoid it would be like being pricked by a thousand needles. The cloaks were certainly essential as they could block the light.</p>

  <p>When they knew they were all ready, all of them held their breaths and began walking forward.</p>

  <p>A deafening silence embraced the surroundings. The four top-level war lords from the Night Group moved like the wind. None of them made any sound at all.</p>

  <p>The other war lords, as well as Esther, kept moving slowly.</p>

  <p>As they got closer to the Bloody Pass, they became more alert. From a distance, faint sounds coming from the Swallowing Birds could be heard.</p>

  <p>This meant that there was a large flock of those beasts resting somewhere not too far from where they were.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Bloody Pass, a wolf howled. The atmosphere grew darker and heavier by the minute.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had never seen any Azure Wolf before, he reckoned that it was definitely no weaker than a Swallowing Bird. It didn't even matter what kind of creature they encountered. They knew they had to stay vigilant at all times.</p>

  <p>Holding their breaths, everyone moved at a careful pace. It was so quiet that only the beating of their hearts was audible.</p>

  <p>Lucky for them, the Bloody Pass wasn't as vast as the others. If they successfully walked through it, they were safe.</p>

  <p>They moved cautiously for about five minutes more. Just walking on a few more steps, they could arrive at the exit point.</p>

  <p>"We made it." Fabian sighed when almost reaching the end of the pass.</p>

  <p>The rest sighed in relief, almost in unison. They all looked at each other as if checking if anyone was harmed in any way.</p>

  <p>In just a matter of seconds, all of them began to notice a faint light right before them. Some were curious, while the others were somehow threatened.</p>

  <p>The light continued to flicker. As it did, their curiosity also rose.</p>

  <p>Deciding to follow the light, Zheng carefully made his way. Upon reaching a certain point, he saw a peculiar plant.</p>

  <p>The palm-sized plant had three leaves that extended in three different directions. A bunch of hairy stamens from one of the stems emitted a faint, orange glow. It was quite beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Could this be the Moon Shadow Begonia?"</p>

  <p>Excitement replaced their fear and curiosity. However, greed was painted all over the expressions of the Night Group members. All of them hurriedly walked towards the plant.</p>

  <p>Considered as one of the rarest herbs in the Dark Nether Cave, the Moon Shadow Begonia was said to broaden the pubic region of one's body, which was very beneficial for the warriors who intended to reach the Soul Sea Realm. Back then, only three Moon Shadow Begonias were found in the cave. They were taken by three warriors, who had successfully become the masters of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>As the supreme master of the Sea God Continent, Amber had taken one of the three Moon Shadow Begonias.</p>

  <p>Through the power of the Moon Shadow Begonia, Amber had easily become the strongest warrior throughout the Soul Sea Realm. The magical plant had the ability to increase a warrior's strength to an unbelievable limit.</p>

  <p>After the warrior's pubic region was enlarged, the amount of life vitality would increase as well, making cultivation methods easier to perform.</p>

  <p>Fixated on the plant, Esther waved her hand to the top-level war lords from the Night Group. "Don't touch it," she said in a very low voice, calmly. She wasn't so sure if they heard her, so she kept on waving her hand.</p>

  <p>The Moon Shadow Begonia grew on the territory of the Azure Wolf. The Night Group warriors' hiding skills were not to be trampled with, but picking the flower meant exposing all of them to danger.</p>

  <p>At that time, Esther was unable to communicate with others clearly with her life vitality. They were close to the Swallowing Bird's and Azure Wolf's homes, and activating their life vitality could alert the beasts.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Esther, her fellow Night Group war lords didn't intend on listening to her pleas.</p>

  <p>Both Fabian's and Jarrod's faces were now covered in sweat. One wrong move could cause them everything that they had gone through for this specific journey. Not to mention the sleeping beasts that knew no mercy.</p>

  <p>"Xun," Zheng called softly, glancing at his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>As a sword spirit, Xun had some skills that were like that of Zheng. They both didn't need to circulate their life vitality to resist the Dark Nether Death Light. In addition, she was able to fly.</p>

  <p>Her sword spirit body belonged to Zheng. Thus, when she flew, she did not consume her life vitality.</p>

  <p>Understanding what Zheng's glance meant, Xun floated towards the Moon Shadow Begonia like an entity without legs. They all knew of her capacity but were still in awe.</p>

  <p>Even though Xun's actions could possibly alert the monsters nearby, Zheng wanted her to pick the plant first, before the greedy members of the Night Group could get to them. Regardless, they were eventually going to face these monsters anyway. It was a consequence Zheng had accepted.</p>

  <p>The Night Group war lords each made their way to the plant while Xun was able to get to it in just one quick move.</p>

  <p>Seeing through Xun's intentions of picking up the plant first, each of them muttered under their breaths. Surprised and displeased, they could only watch Xun do the deed. It was no secret what the Moon Shadow Begonia had to offer, so they believed that putting their lives at risk was going to be worth it in the end. Anger filled all of them as they watched Xun tower over the plant before they even had the chance to touch it.</p>

  <p>The sword spirit ignored the angry warriors surrounding her. Her moves were so quick and accurate that the tip of her long spear was able to obtain the plant in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>A cold smile played on her face. Victory. Turning her back against them, she flew over to Zheng.</p>

  <p>It angered all the four top-level Night Group war lords. One of them, making sure to speak in a low voice, said, "Give it back!"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think you have the right to take it?"</p>

  <p>Xun retorted, lowering her voice as well.</p>

  <p>"If you don't hand it back, we will call out for the Azure Wolves!" one of the rage-filled war lords of the Night Group exclaimed, grinding his teeth.</p>

  <p>As the Demon Night queen, Xun was not affected by the others' threats. "Do it then, if you dare." Possessing such strength and magic, Xun refused to give in.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Esther and Fabian were starting to get annoyed. Those shady Night Group members should've not been there in the first place. They were all so well-behaved earlier. Now, they were acting like a bunch of animals fighting over a piece of meat.</p>

  <p>Staring at the tip of Xun's spear, one of the war lords noticed that the Moon Shadow Begonia still released a glow. This caused the warrior to charge directly towards Xun, not caring about the other dangers of the mountains anymore.</p>

  <p>"Catch this," Xun shook her long spear and tossed the plant to Zheng.</p>

  <p>She began to rotate her weapon in her hands. Without looking, she was able to stab the figure behind her.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng were to fight that war lord, he wouldn't stand a chance. As for Xun, she did it without even taking a glance. It was a precise strike.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he was stabbed, the top-level war lord of the Night Group trembled in disbelief. How could he not have dodged that attack?</p>

  <p>As he fell down, this particular war lord let out a piercing cry. Some of it was out of pain, and some was to spite the beasts.</p>

  <p>Hearing the sounds he was making, everyone was paralyzed with fear.</p>
