<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1941 The Boundary Wall (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>However, compared to the other Godly Geniuses, it was still the worst.</p>

  <p>The speed at which Zheng's Boundary Cloud spreading was astonishing, but the distance it finally reached was not phenomenal. It could even be described as mediocre for a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng still kept a close watch of his inner world. He stared with eyes full of concentration at the light curtain at the edge of his inner world…</p>

  <p>The light curtain formed a common boundary wall. If the world were a universe that was created by a Holy Being, then the wall would be what people referred to as a Sighing Wall. It meant that even a True God could do nothing to it but sigh.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the light curtain began to undergo an extravagant change!</p>

  <p>Golden dots of light continued to condense on the light curtain and formed golden vortexes! Power and intensity radiated in their glow.</p>

  <p>Zheng was no stranger to these golden vortexes. He had seen them before.</p>

  <p>When he used the Grand Weapon Refining Method to refine his body, these golden vortexes had always appeared when his body touched preternatural flames.</p>

  <p>As Zheng looked closely at the golden vortexes, he noticed that they were inscribed by obscure golden Sanskrit words, which rotated at an extremely fast speed!</p>

  <p>The Grand Weapon Refining Method was obtained by Zheng from the Divine Flame Cauldron. It was a cultivation method passed on to him by Mike. The changes and reactions with the golden vortexes were not strange to him.</p>

  <p>But why had Sanskrit words suddenly appeared on the light curtain when he tried to break through to become a world lord?</p>

  <p>According to Holy Jay's speculations, the Sanskrit words should've belonged to extraordinary creatures that had never appeared and whose state of lives had been incomprehensible. Why had these golden words appeared on the boundary wall?</p>

  <p>Whoosh…</p>

  <p>A golden dot of light finally stopped its rotation and turned into a huge golden Sanskrit word that was embedded on the top of the light curtain.</p>

  <p>It was just a golden Sanskrit word, but it hid a massive amount of information. However, with Zheng's knowledge, he couldn't decipher it. He couldn't read Sanskrit even though it was in his inner world. He couldn't decipher the Sanskrit words recorded in the Grand Weapon Refining Method, either.</p>

  <p>In truth, within the divine land, there were a large number of people that studied the meaning and content of that type of Sanskrit. They spent an enormous amount of time in the investigation of that particular type of Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>The moment the golden dot of light was embedded on the boundary wall, a robust boundary-forming power surged out! Suddenly the wall became even more stable!</p>

  <p>Because his boundary-forming power had activated the vitality between heaven and earth above the Valley of Time, it caused his Boundary Cloud to rapidly expand once more. And this time, within several seconds, the Boundary Cloud had spread to a distance of 19 miles away.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Dragon Flyer race, the several Godly Geniuses, and the other martial artists who witnessed the scene looked at each other in confusion.</p>

  <p>Their eyes and mouth were wide open at the spectacular occurrence before them.</p>

  <p>The audience couldn't believe that the Boundary Cloud had another wave of expansion!</p>

  <p>"How the hell is this guy condensing his own boundary wall? Could it be that there are several layers of walls? How could this happen? Where did he get such strength?" Lawson couldn't help but sigh while his shoulders dropped.</p>

  <p>When a warrior condensed his boundary wall, it represented that the warrior had successfully become a world lord. Almost every one condensed the wall in one attempt. It was almost impossible to condense the wall more than once.</p>

  <p>However, there were cases that some warriors had spread their Boundary Clouds twice or even three times within a short period. But that was only because their first or second attempt to condense the wall had failed, and they still wanted to break through the bottleneck in a short period of time. Additionally, every time their attempt failed, the Boundary Cloud formed in the previous attempt would dissipate.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Zheng's situation was completely different. His Boundary Cloud had never dissipated. Instead, it was pushed even further by the boundary-forming power within his inner world time and time again.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it spread out at high speed…</p>

  <p>Even the warriors from the Dragon Flyer race who had tried to break through to become world lords many times had never heard of such thing, and less so for those Godly Geniuses! Most of the audience had never seen such an incredible feat!</p>

  <p>"This kind of situation usually happens when the boundary wall is repeatedly consolidated, and the boundary-forming power is activated again and again. I'm really curious, just what sort of changes has happened in this boy's inner world? I'm sure he still has a lot of surprises to show." Even Holy Jay's heart was entranced with curiosity. His eyes observed him like a new experiment.</p>

  <p>Not long after the first golden Sanskrit word was embedded in the boundary wall, the second golden dot of light also stopped its rotation. It turned into a huge golden Sanskrit word before it embedded itself in the wall. Afterward, the third Sanskrit word followed, and then the fourth Sanskrit word…</p>

  <p>Huge golden Sanskrit words surrounded the chaotic sea as they sank themselves in the boundary wall one by one. The boundary-forming power spread out in waves. Each wave radiated more energy than the one before.</p>

  <p>Fifteen miles…</p>

  <p>Twenty miles…</p>

  <p>Twenty-five miles…</p>

  <p>Eventually, Zheng's Boundary Cloud broke Nathan's and Tianming's records.</p>

  <p>What was even more peculiar was that the Boundary Cloud that spread was actually stacked with multiple layers. Viewed from the ground, it looked like countless rings that were formed in the sky by Boundary Clouds. The rings were linked with one another, from smaller ones to bigger ones.</p>

  <p>As the martial artists witnessed the extraordinary spectacle, confusion enveloped them. How could there be so many rings of Boundary Cloud that appeared all of a sudden?</p>
