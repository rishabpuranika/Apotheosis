<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone considered Galen as a strong warrior but now he had been pounded against the mountain wall by this young man's punch. Even the sword wind that had been curling up towards Luo Zheng dissipated.</p>

  <p>When the crowd saw this scene, they were all shocked and intrigued.</p>

  <p>Judging from the way this young man spoke to Luo Zheng, it appeared that he was familiar with him. So was he here to protect Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>However, the young man shot a cold glance at Luo Zheng before zooming off to the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>Galen struggled for a while on the mountain wall before he could emerge.</p>

  <p>His wrinkled face was full of ferocity as he glared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Galen wanted to kill Luo Zheng, but he had been forewarned by the young man. What was more, he had now learned about the consequences of attacking Luo Zheng. Left with no option, he left.</p>

  <p>However, everyone present could see that Galen would never allow Luo Zheng to get away with this so easily.</p>

  <p>The young men in white robes didn't leave with Galen. At last, one of them floated over to Luo Zheng. He stared at Luo Zheng with a weird smile on his face and said, "You're doomed, you know that? If you leave now, you will definitely be hunted down and slain by Flag Master Galen. But if you choose to pass through the Sword Wall, you will also die. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>The young man in white was the one who had made fun of Jagger just now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cast a cold glance at him and said, "Since the end result of both options is death, what's your point of talking nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"Because if you got through the Sword Wall, I might have to kill you myself. I'm not a loser like Jagger! If I get my hands on you, you'd better commit suicide. Otherwise, I will show you what it feels like to live in hell!" said the man with a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's lips curled up. These people were all arrogant and thought highly of themselves. He then smirked. "Well, I'm right here in front of you. If you think you are capable of killing me, you can give it a shot. But I think you and Jagger are the same loser type. Not qualified enough to do so!"</p>

  <p>A cold light flashed in the young man's eyes, but when he thought of what had just happened to Galen, he restrained himself. "A cocky person like you can't survive for three days behind the Sword Wall. I hope you can enter as soon as possible. And you'd better remember my name, dude. I am Harden Zhao!"</p>

  <p>After saying this, he walked away with the other young men in white robes.</p>

  <p>They all looked at Luo Zheng indifferently. For them, Luo Zheng was no one but a poor guy who would die sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Luo Zheng shouted suddenly.</p>

  <p>Harden Zhao turned his head and looked at Luo Zheng strangely. "Do you have any last words? Don't bother begging for mercy. Flag Master Galen will not let you go, and neither will we!"</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" Luo Zheng asked coolly.</p>

  <p>"Harden Zhao," answered the young man proudly.</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Zheng repeated.</p>

  <p>"My name is Harden..." He finally understood that Luo Zheng was making a fool of him.</p>

  <p>A sneer appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he apologized, "I'm sorry. My memory is bad. I can't remember the name of a loser."</p>

  <p>The crowd below the Sword Wall burst into laughter at his jibe.</p>

  <p>Those disciples from the Sword Light Palace, including Beldene and Elgin, tried hard to hold back their laughter meanwhile. "I didn't expect that Luo Zheng could play such a trick," Kenelm said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" Harden's face turned red with anger.</p>

  <p>The other young men in white robes also had a ghastly killing intent in their eyes. Whenever they came to maintain the order of the Sword Wall, they were received with respect and adoration. This time, not only Jagger was killed by Luo Zheng, but their member was also humiliated like this. How could they tolerate it?</p>

  <p>Seeing that Harden's aura had increased greatly, a man next to him nudged him. "Harden, did you forget what Mr. Lu has said? We can't kill him here," he reminded.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lu, who had attacked Galen, was a superior being. None of the men in white could afford to offend him.</p>

  <p>"Calm down! When he enters the Sword Wall, we will have a hundred opportunities to kill him." Another young man in a white robe glanced at Luo Zheng and then sneered.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng looked at him calmly and asked, "Sir, what's your name?"</p>

  <p>When the man was about to open his mouth to answer, he remembered Luo Zheng's previous trick. His face darkened and he grunted before flying away with his companions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly landed once they left.</p>

  <p>When Carlisle saw that his brother had been killed and Galen had retreated, his face turned ashen. Just as he was about to exit with his people, Luo Zheng suddenly said, "Wait a minute!"</p>

  <p>Carlisle's shoulders twitched as he turned around. "What, what do you want?" he stammered nervously.</p>

  <p>The people who had come with him were equally frightened. Luo Zheng had killed Jagger, a mighty warrior. Then how could these people dare to challenge him?</p>

  <p>Looking at Carlisle, Luo Zheng asked, "How's your compatibility with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent?"</p>

  <p>Carlisle hadn't expected Luo Zheng to ask him such a question. He thought that Luo Zheng would not show him any mercy. Heaving a sigh of relief, he replied without hesitation, "Twenty percent."</p>

  <p>"Only twenty percent?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p>

  <p>It was not a very high level of compatibility. Although the Lofty Sword could not tell the degree of compatibility, there was another way. By reciting the Truth of Godly Way, a warrior could figure out their compatibility levels with it.</p>

  <p>For example, Luo Zheng was capable of Instant Enlightenment, which meant his compatibility degree was one hundred percent. Elgin and Beldene could recite about four thousand words, so their compatibility degree would be around forty percent or maybe even higher.</p>

  <p>The young master of the Wang Clan was no talent so his compatibility level was only twenty percent.</p>

  <p>Even in the Sword Light Palace, Carlisle was regarded as a mediocre disciple among all the others.</p>

  <p>When the other disciples heard this, they were incredulous. They immediately understood what Luo Zheng meant.</p>

  <p>For a talent like Luo Zheng, passing this Sword Wall was a foregone conclusion.</p>

  <p>The disciples didn't have the slightest doubt about that, but what about the others? Elgin and Beldene might just succeed, but it would be difficult for the rest to pass.</p>

  <p>Carlisle's compatibility degree was only twenty percent. If he succeeded, it would mean one of two things: Either getting through the Sword Wall was easy or there were other ways to make up for a low compatibility degree.</p>

  <p>"If it's only twenty percent, it will be very difficult for you to pass the Sword Wall. But you seem to be very confident. How's that?" Luo Zheng asked again, feeling baffled at Carlisle's behavior.</p>

  <p>Carlisle nodded. "It has taken me many years to cultivate the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. I'm aware that it's difficult for me to surpass the Sword Wall, considering my low compatibility degree, but I have a way to get the recognition of the Sword Wall."</p>

  <p>The Sword Wall had served as a screen for a long time. Some people who were reluctant to be rejected would have figured out some tricks to cross it, but the Taiyi Heaven Palace turned a blind eye to them. As a result, many unjustifiable methods had come up.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Zheng asked, staring at Carlisle eagerly.</p>

  <p>Noticing the hesitation in Carlisle's eyes, Luo Zheng ordered, "Tell me!"</p>
