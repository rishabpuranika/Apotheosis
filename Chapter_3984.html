<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Faced with such a dire situation, they had no way of retreating.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Fuxi brought out the Solid Lightning Powder.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With just a slight shake of his hand, the scattered granules of the Solid Lightning Powder clumped together as if by an invisible force and turned into a huge palm.</p>

  <p>This palm was even bigger than the previous one.</p>

  <p>When the bull-headed man with golden horns and the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit saw the palm, their eyes narrowed slightly. Although they had never seen this before, but something about it attracted attention.</p>

  <p>The other bull-headed men subconsciously took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>They didn't know how the Solid Lightning Powder could channel the lightning from the Heavenly Thunder Plain, but its power was still quite terrifying.</p>

  <p>Whoever took action first would be blasted into pieces by the lightning.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits were at an advantage now. They had seen the power of the Solid Lightning Powder before. And at the moment, they were waiting for those who had no idea about the power to charge forward.</p>

  <p>However, it was natural that the creatures that could survive in the harsh environment of the Three Purities Stage would not be so stupid.</p>

  <p>As soon as Fuxi brought out the powder, they immediately went on high alert.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" a giant asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," another giant replied, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, be careful. Retreat slowly. We need to be careful!" The mouse shaped creatures began to retreat.</p>

  <p>The other creatures followed suit.</p>

  <p>"These people are just playing tricks on you. You all are incredibly powerful in the Grand Pure Realm. Why are you so scared of them?" the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit asked loudly.</p>

  <p>Let alone the giant creatures, even the small mouse-shaped creatures would not be easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>True to their shape, these creatures were known as the Terror Mice. The destructive power of their seemingly small bodies was easily about one fifth of what the bull-headed men were packing. Moreover, their number was much larger than that of the bull-headed men.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you attack them first if you are so sure?" one of the Terror Mice asked.</p>

  <p>They weren't the only ones who were displeased. Other creatures also cast unfriendly gazes at the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit. She was way too cunning for comfort.</p>

  <p>Time passed by. The two sides were at a stalemate.</p>

  <p>"They dare not attack us," Fuxi remarked from the middle of the vine. His hand was raised and he would have sent out the powder any time.</p>

  <p>"It's not that they do not dare," the Snake Goddess shook her head in negation. "Rather, they are not of one mind. They each have their own plans about dealing with us and they can't come to a single decision."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. The problem is, every single one of them wants to pay less and get more in return," Yasamin replied, shaking her head with a sneer. But there was a hint of sadness in her smile.</p>

  <p>She had just regained her freedom and would have liked to see Dorothy.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed like she had no chance at the moment.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, do you have some ideas? You look rather calm," Eastern Emperor Taiyi suddenly asked through telepathy.</p>

  <p>His lips had moved slightly, but his words were heard clearly by everyone on the Heavenly Eye Vine.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment and then replied in affirmation, "Yes, I do have an idea. When I say, you grab the Heavenly Eye Vine."</p>

  <p>Everyone was confused when they heard his words.</p>

  <p>How could he escape from such a dire situation?</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked at Zheng sideways. She guessed that there was a chance he might have received the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guidance.</p>

  <p>Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven had the power and the skill to make the Solid Lightning Powder in the Heavenly Thunder Plain, perhaps he also had a way of dealing with the Purple Wind Gorge.</p>

  <p>In any case, Zheng's words did calm everyone down a little.</p>

  <p>In fact, Thurston and Sawyer were no longer worried. They fully trusted Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was a strange look in Pearson's eyes though.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunters weren't the targets of the Element Spirit Civilization. If the creatures did decide to attack them later on, he would easily find a way to take Thurston and Sawyer away. As for the humans, he was already being rather kind by not adding insult to injury.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just then, a group of Earthly Dragon Snakes also climbed to the seventh stair.</p>

  <p>In the last attack, although Fuxi's Solid Lightning Powder had proven incredibly effective and powerful, it hadn't killed them all. Instead, most of them had passed out because of the shock wave. After a long time, they had woken up and were chasing after them once again.</p>

  <p>That did not mean that they were unharmed. They had suffered a great loss due to the Solid Lightning Powder. When they saw it in front of Fuxi, they instinctively felt scared.</p>

  <p>However, they did not tell other creatures about the power of the powder.</p>

  <p>Instead, they carefully retreated to a side and hid their poisonous jaws. It was time for some other tactic instead of a head-on collision.</p>

  <p>Very soon, a few more creatures came. The already small seventh stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau was becoming rather crowded now. But when the last team finally came up, the eyes of all the creatures present lit up as if they had found salvation.</p>

  <p>The final team comprised of several round stone creatures, known as the Stone Spirits.</p>

  <p>These creatures were extremely powerful and known to possess infinite amounts of strength. Strictly speaking, the Stone Spirits were under complete control of the Element Spirit Civilization. The Element Spirit Civilization had always treated these spirits in a special manner, and they had maintained a good relationship since a long time ago.</p>

  <p>However, the Stone Spirits' intelligence was extremely low. They had no strategic ideas and could be easily cheated, which meant they weren't of much use on their own.</p>

  <p>After the announcement of the bounty, the Stone Spirits had come here in a hurry, but they weren't here for the bounty. They just wanted to help the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>After the Stone Spirits climbed up one by one, they fixed their eyes on Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>No one spoke or gave any orders to them. Instead, as if they were pre-programmed robots, they acted on their own.</p>

  <p>The Stone Spirits marched forward and rushed towards Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others saw the Stone Spirits coming their way, and they immediately had a bad feeling about that.</p>

  <p>The other creatures were unwilling to make a move first because they were suspicious of each other. The Stone Spirits, however, were simple-minded.</p>

  <p>And if they were ridiculed by the other creatures and goaded into attacking Zheng and his group, they would instantly attack. And who could deal with their attacks!</p>

  <p>The situation right now was even worse than they had imagined. The Stone Spirits had instantly rushed towards them right after arriving there.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>The Stone Spirits rushed over in unison, and the ground of the seventh stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau began to tremble from their march.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, aren't you ready yet?" Fuxi called out anxiously.</p>

  <p>It was a matter of life and death now, and he had become very serious.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and said, "Now's not the time!"</p>

  <p>"Then I guess we'll have to fight." Fuxi's palm shook slightly, and a mark of the Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared and began floating in the middle of the Stone Spirits.</p>

  <p>"Let me fight first," Pearson said as he stepped forwards. He waved his hands gently and his arms turned into spider threads that swept towards the Stone Spirits. The Stone Spirits who were wrapped by the spider threads immediately stopped as if they had lost all of their strength and will power.</p>

  <p>Within a few seconds, Pearson's entire body had turned into spider threads and wrapped up the Stone Spirits. The Stone Spirits were totally motionless now.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Stone Spirits had been stopped, the other creatures began to make their moves now.</p>

  <p>The ones who were shrouded in the mist made the first move. As they stretched out their hands, waves of white mist began floating towards the bodies of the Stone Spirits. When the mist had completely enveloped the Stone Spirits, it turned purple.</p>

  <p>These creatures could control several forms of mist, and each of them had a different effect. The red blood mist had the power to confuse the enemy; the yellow poison mist was highly toxic; the green spiritual mist could generate white bones and muscles; the purple mist could corrode everything.</p>

  <p>It was undoubtedly not easy to corrode the Stone Spirits. Moreover, the mist creatures hadn't launched a heavy attack this time. Their main goal was to corrode the spider threads wrapped around the Stone Spirits' bodies.</p>

  <p>Pearson's body, which was in the form of spider threads, would be corroded into nothingness very soon.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the purple mist was formed, Pearson sensed the danger and immediately pulled back the spider threads to form his body.</p>

  <p>Even though his reaction had been extremely fast, the spider threads had broken down at several places. If he had moved just a little later, he would have been completely corroded by the purple mist.</p>

  <p>As soon as the spider threads were removed, the Stone Spirits began moving once again.</p>
