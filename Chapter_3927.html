  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had worked hard to come up with the situation.</p>

  <p>But only within a short period, it was ruined.</p>

  <p>The people who had been controlled had obtained their freedom, resulting in him facing seven opponents including Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, Judson, Zheng, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Herbert!</p>

  <p>They were all top masters of the Eternal Realm, except for the three Chaos Ancient Gods— Judson, Herbert and Gerald; and Zheng was even more remarkable.</p>

  <p>As for the Grandmaster of Heaven, he only had one helper, the captain of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>In the face of these powerful masters, the captain could not do anything to them. When it came to real strength, he would be at a disadvantage in the battle with Fuxi, far inferior to the real Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"I made the correct judgment when we were in the Grand Plain Stage," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, staring at Zheng with confidence.</p>

  <p>He believed that Zheng deserved the Nihility race's great deal of effort to win him over, so he took action in person. Unfortunately, neither he nor Claire had succeeded.</p>

  <p>Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven both had sharp intuition. They were determined that they had to get Zheng. He could either be destroyed or become a huge hidden trouble if they couldn't get him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the only purpose that the Black Ship and the Bearing race attacked the Oneness Sky Palace after Zheng entered the Eternal Scroll Painting was to take him.</p>

  <p>However, contrary to the wishes of the Black Ship and the Bearing race, the situation had developed to this point after the three forces took action. It was beyond the Grandmaster of Heaven's expectations.</p>

  <p>It had only been a short while since Zheng returned, but he was able to kill him.</p>

  <p>What kind of bloodline did Zheng get?</p>

  <p>Even the origin-level bloodline shouldn't be so powerful in a short time.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter whether your judgment is right or wrong, because you can't affect the situation," Zheng responded, dismissing the Grandmaster of Heaven's certainty.</p>

  <p>There were two choices for the Grandmaster of Heaven at the moment. He could either abandon the Descending Ring and escape back to the Other Shore, or stay where he was and fight to death.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race didn't suffer too much loss. Returning to the Other Shore was the best choice for the Grandmaster of Heaven. He could wait for the next opportunity, and when the Element Spirit Civilization fought with the Pear Hill, he could take the chance to achieve his goal.</p>

  <p>However, he was still a ruthless master who had fought with the Eye Spirit for several hundred chaotic eras. After he heard Zheng's remark, a fierce light flashed through his eyes, and his lips curled into a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha...</p>

  <p>It's so ridiculous..." the Grandmaster of Heaven said condescendingly.</p>

  <p>He pointed at Gerald, saying, "Do you really think that you will be able to reverse the situation just because there is someone like Zheng in this round of chaos? Do you think that the Finale Way, which could not be completed for over a thousand chaotic eras, could be completed this time?"</p>

  <p>His voice resonated with sarcasm as he heard what Gerald had just said to Herbert.</p>

  <p>"The only fate of the chaos is to remain desolate forever. This chaos and the other tens of thousands of worlds could never escape from it, including you!" the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered as he waved his hand at the crowd.</p>

  <p>The faces of Gerald, Judson, Herbert and Fuxi were consumed with shock as they heard this declaration.</p>

  <p>However, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Zheng, and the real Snake Goddess stayed calm, unswayed by his words.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had great insight and sensed the wave of emotions crashing over everyone. However, he wondered why Zheng, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the real Snake Goddess seemed unbothered.</p>

  <p>"The other tens of thousands of worlds... Do you mean that there are similar worlds outside the chaos that have been destroyed?" Fuxi asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, Fuxi knew that there was an Abstruse Energy World outside the chaos, but he didn't know that there were tens of thousands of other worlds similar to the chaos and that all of them had faced destruction.</p>

  <p>"With your thoughts and intelligence, you simply couldn't understand what happened." The Grandmaster of Heaven glared at Fuxi indifferently.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi stared at him in confusion. As a replicate, Fuxi was not taken seriously by the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"We can't understand? You are exaggerating!" The real Snake Goddess glanced at the Grandmaster of Heaven, turned around, and explained to Fuxi, "The chaos is just a tool to absorb energy. There are tens of thousands of similar worlds outside, and these worlds have provided them with a steady stream of energy. However, they are not united as one. Maybe they have been divided into two factions, three factions, or even more. When these factions took action against each other, many worlds were destroyed, and only the chaos was left. The Element Spirit Civilization is one of those factions." The real Snake Goddess pointed at the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"And you have joined the faction that constantly destroys the worlds and have become their puppet," she accused.</p>

  <p>Fuxi speechlessly stared at the real Snake Goddess, wondering why this wisp of energy soul knew so much.</p>

  <p>Gerald, Judson, and Herbert were even more stunned, their eyes widening over what was said.</p>

  <p>The entire chaos was only a tool for absorbing energy.</p>

  <p>There were still many similar worlds, but in the end, the Finale Way had never succeeded. Those worlds had all been destroyed by the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Every word set their eyes ablaze, like shocking lightning.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the real Snake Goddess, almost seeming to commend her unforeseen intelligence.</p>

  <p>When Zheng returned from the Eternal Scroll Painting and passed through the world of the Ultimate Cycle, the real Snake Goddess that was attached to Zheng's body had deciphered some special information. Later, he had gained some knowledge from the brush-wielder, but the brush-wielder had not yet explained everything to him.</p>

  <p>Neither Zheng nor the Primeval Lord of Heaven knew whether the chaos was the last remaining world or not...</p>

  <p>But as soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven said those words, the real Snake Goddess came to this conclusion according to his revelation. It was completely logical–worthy for both Zheng's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's admiration.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't expect that the real Snake Goddess would know so much. The excitement on his face slowly faded into a darker emotion, but he still managed to mock her, "So what? My senior fellow disciple has persisted for such a long time, but he hasn't even found out the truth. Now you still want to complete the Finale Way? It is just wishful thinking!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the Grandmaster of Heaven make such remarks of ridicule, the real Snake Goddess only shrugged it off with a smile. She knew that the brush-wielder gave Zheng the hope, which meant that there was a chance to complete the Finale Way. The Grandmaster of Heaven was clueless about that.</p>

  <p>"Wait and see if it is just wishful thinking. What I know is you're in a bad situation now!"</p>

  <p>Zheng slightly leaned his body forward and disappeared after taking a step.</p>

  <p>He transformed into a thin thread, spreading towards the Grandmaster of Heaven at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>After seeing Zheng do his move, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, and the three Chaos Ancient Gods also took action!</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors each activated their strength at the same time. Even the huge chaos clouds on the side drifted away slowly as if wanting to keep distance from the battle.</p>

  <p>"There are some powers that are inappropriate for you," the Grandmaster of Heaven said with a domineering aura. "There are things that you don't qualify to know, and there are also some powers that you cannot resist. In that case, let me show you the foundation of the Nihility race!"</p>
