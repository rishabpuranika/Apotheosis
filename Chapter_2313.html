<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2313 Divine Time Temple </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>There was no hesitation in the True Gods' steps as they all rushed forward.</p>

  <p>"Follow me." It was casually said by the still calm Langston to Liusu who was behind him.</p>

  <p>The expression on her face was blank as she galloped ahead. But she was still worried about Aleyna and Kelsey, so she turned to look at them from time to time.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Aleyna, and Kelsey all moved behind her but kept a certain distance. The Time Ghosts behind them began to take the later True Gods as their first targets.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A Time Ghost suddenly came closer and its body coiled around a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Ah! Help!"</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God screamed in pain and couldn't stop the shaking of his body. Soon, a shallow trace appeared on his head and his solid skull was cut evenly in just a second. Red and white things burst out of it and terrified those who saw it.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>More and more traces appeared on the mid-rank True God's body, making more blood spurt from him.</p>

  <p>The grotesque scene made Kelsey extremely pale, so she activated all of her strength and tried to run as fast as possible.</p>

  <p>However, in that moment, a low-rank True God beside Kelsey moved a little too slowly, and was entangled by a Time Ghost. He then grabbed Kelsey's hand almost instinctively!</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Kelsey screamed loudly as she tried to break free from the True God's grip, but he was more powerful than she expected and she couldn't get rid of him.</p>

  <p>Three Time Ghosts were about to pounce on Kelsey while she was distracted.</p>

  <p>"Kelsey!"</p>

  <p>"Kelsey!"</p>

  <p>There was heavy worry on Liusu's face as she turned and rushed towards Kelsey.</p>

  <p>And there was Aleyna who stood frozen still from fear.</p>

  <p>The terrified Kelsey turned to look at Zheng, unable to accept that she would die here!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Right at the critical moment, Zheng flashed and gently pushed his finger forward and pressed on the arm of the low-rank True God. An invisible force came forward and tried to cut the low-rank True God's arm.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The low-rank True God's arm was broken and Zheng grabbed Kelsey. He turned around quickly and grasped the shaking Aleyna. Then he carried them both under his armpits. A huge force erupted from his feet.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>All of the True Gods charged forward at their fastest speed to run for their lives. A gust of wind blew past them and it was a low-rank True God who was holding two proving godly warriors and speeding away.</p>

  <p>The speed of the low-rank True God stunned the rest.</p>

  <p>Liusu stared blankly at the scene until Zheng rushed to her with his two young sisters in tow. He smiled and said, "Run! Don't just stand there!"</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business!" It was Liusu's quick retort but she thought that she overreacted. Zheng didn't seem to care about her and he only warned her. That thought made a bitter feeling rise up in her chest.</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts' speed was slightly faster than that of the True Gods and so anyone who was slow would get attacked and it would be almost impossible to escape.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the True Gods subconsciously raised their speed when they heard a shrill cry from behind them.</p>

  <p>Even with all of them desperately on the run, Zheng's speed was exceptionally fast. His strength burst out and he sprinted to the front of the group.</p>

  <p>"We're here! The Divine Time Temple's right in front of us! The Time Ghosts can't enter it!" a mid-rank True God shouted.</p>

  <p>A strange temple appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>Even True Gods had limited physical strength and as they ran, many looked completely exhausted but those words made all of them brighten up.</p>

  <p>"Let's go in!"</p>

  <p>"We can hide in the Divine Time Temple for a while!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>All of the True Gods sped up once again.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng carried two people, his expression didn't change at all and his speed just became faster and faster. He was the first to rush into the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>Even far outside the forbidden land, there were Holy Beings who paid attention to Zheng's actions.</p>

  <p>"But how could a low-rank True God have such great endurance and move so quickly? With those two in his arms, he still managed to be the first to enter the temple." the Demi-holy Being of the Tang Clan said curiously.</p>

  <p>There were some guesses about Zheng's identity. Langston and Rachelle might be more knowledgeable about it, but the Holy Beings didn't pay much attention to things on the Floating Islands and thus they didn't know of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, Joy was the only one who knew the truth.</p>

  <p>A faint smile hung on her lips as she looked at Zheng, but she also couldn't squash the worry in her heart.</p>

  <p>She wasn't aware that Zheng would be invited by the Sun Blind race. If he revealed his secret right now, how would he escape from the Holy Beings? Zheng was truly fearless...</p>

  <p>No one knew what Samuel was thinking about when he stared at Zheng, as he looked perfectly calm.</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods rushed into the Divine Time Temple and looked worn out, except for the top-rank True Gods. Even Liusu gasped for air as she circulated the momentum in her body to calm herself down.</p>

  <p>Even after the last True God dashed into the Divine Time Temple, the Time Ghosts still continued to rush towards the temple!</p>

  <p>The dense mass of Time Ghosts coming over them like the tide made Kelsey and Aleyna who managed to calm themselves down become nervous again. They pinched at Zheng's arms in fear.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Many True Gods screamed when the Time Ghosts reached the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>It was the first time for many of them to enter the Time Sea Forbidden Land, so it was natural that they were worried. If the Time Ghosts could really charge in, none of them would be able to escape.</p>

  <p>But the Time Ghosts couldn't move forward from the door of the Divine Time Temple. They were densely packed outside, as if an invisible wall had sealed them off. The Time Ghosts truly were unable to enter the Divine Time Temple!</p>

  <p>Only then did the True Gods heave a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Just like a group of bugs, the Time Ghosts crowded in a heap and looked just as disgusting. Everyone were shocked and frightened at the sight of them.</p>

  <p>"Ah, the arm..." Kelsey was almost faint from fear and belatedly noticed the severed low-rank True God's arm still grasping her tightly.</p>

  <p>"Don't move." Zheng reached out his hand and lightly patted the arm, making it drop to the ground where he kicked it aside. With that taken care of, he stood up to observe the interior of the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>That was when they all heard a scream from outside the Divine Time Temple. "Help! Help me drive away the Time Ghosts..."</p>

  <p>Through the translucent Time Ghosts, they saw Reginald, the top-rank True God, rushing forward with a group of Time Ghosts on his heels.</p>

  <p>There were so many Time Ghosts gathering at the door of the Divine Time Temple and he'd have no chance to get in.</p>

  <p>Reginald took the risk and attracted the Time Ghosts to another direction for everyone's safety just now. They couldn't just stand by and let him be dragged away.</p>

  <p>But who was willing to go out to help him?</p>
