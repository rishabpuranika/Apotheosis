  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The head of the Multiple Antennae Snake was still spinning as its red light shone on its surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Let's go!"</p>

  <p>When she rushed over, Yan called out to Zheng right away.</p>

  <p>With a nod, Zheng somersaulted with his flying sword and joined the team that was ready to flee.</p>

  <p>The four of them fidgeted around in the cracks of the red light and constantly dodged them.</p>

  <p>"Down there!"</p>

  <p>Zheng yelled out the warning.</p>

  <p>They all dodged to two sides swiftly.</p>

  <p>A beam of red light, much like sword radiance extending to an endless distance, shot upward from below.</p>

  <p>"Left!"</p>

  <p>Just as they avoided the light, another one swept towards them from the other side.</p>

  <p>So they sank down and dodged it once again.</p>

  <p>Never did they expect dozens of antennae to suddenly emerge from the ground at this time— one of the antennae managed to wrap around Yan.</p>

  <p>In spite of being trapped, Yan didn't seem anxious— she barely even struggled. With a slight flash of purple light in her eyes, she uttered,</p>

  <p>"Break."</p>

  <p>Poof!</p>

  <p>The antennae surrounding her were broken in an instant.</p>

  <p>When she uttered the word 'break, ' it was as though a person had cut off the antennae swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Yan, look up! Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Although Yan acted quickly and the antennae had grabbed her for a mere moment, two red lights fell from above her head.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes almost fell out of their sockets upon witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>On the flying sword, Zheng immediately halted and turned back.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's face changed dramatically as well. To him, everyone there could perish— everyone but Zheng and Yan. Nothing could happen to them!</p>

  <p>But who could ever resist the powerful light that burst from the Multiple Antennae Snake's eyes?</p>

  <p>"Zheng, don't go there yourself! Use your avatar to block the red lights!"</p>

  <p>After keeping quiet all the while, the guy with soybean-like eyes suddenly called out to him.</p>

  <p>Their avatars fell behind. Yan had been blocked for a moment, so now the avatars were catching up to them.</p>

  <p>What the soybean-eyed guy said had startled both Zheng and Reinhard.</p>

  <p>Avatars condensed in the arrays couldn't die in the debate venue unless their owners did.</p>

  <p>Conveying their plans to the avatars, the latter jumped up to rush over to Yan's side.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Yan was quick to react. She controlled her avatar and had it hug herself before the other avatars made it to her side and wrapped their arms around her one after another.</p>

  <p>The four avatars held Yan in a tight embrace until the two red lights fell and enveloped the place where Yan just was.</p>

  <p>"The constant light!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows twitched as he stared at the Multiple Antennae Snake from a distance.</p>

  <p>Just now, Zheng had made the absolute worst plan— if Yan truly perished under the red lights, he could hopefully use the jade seal to save her life.</p>

  <p>But it could erase only nine seconds of time.</p>

  <p>Under the continuous light, even if he erased nine seconds, he wouldn't be able to change the result.</p>

  <p>All he could do now was place his hopes on the avatars.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The snake attacked them vigorously, aiming for Yan, and the two red lights shone on her relentlessly.</p>

  <p>"Avatars!"</p>

  <p>"They haven't disintegrated yet!"</p>

  <p>"I hope Yan will survive this!"</p>

  <p>The three of them looked up, their eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>After a moment, the red lights were finally gone.</p>

  <p>The moment the four avatars dispersed, Zheng took a nervous look at Yan.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>When Yan's figure descended, Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>He had no clue what would happen to Yan under the lights but seeing Yan fall already felt like the weight of the world.</p>

  <p>A heavy sense of guilt rose in Zheng's heart. Just as he rushed over, Yan flew straight towards him and smiled when she saw the look on his face. "Zheng, I'm fine!"</p>

  <p>"You scared me!" Zheng was stunned before a look of relief crossed his face— he had forgotten just how naughty Yan was.</p>

  <p>She stuck out her tongue in response, realizing that she had gone too far with her joke. Looking at her brother's pale face, she regretted the prank.</p>

  <p>Just when she was about to offer an apology…</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>A thick flash of lightning suddenly appeared within the depths of the mist.</p>

  <p>It was incredibly fast.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Reinhard could see the light in their periphery when a voice of thunder resounded in their ears.</p>

  <p>Yan, standing only a few feet away from Zheng, suddenly disappeared right in front of him.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Reinhard, and the soybean-eyed guy were left shocked.</p>

  <p>Not far away, a man surrounded by thunder was floating in the air.</p>

  <p>He was much like a human-shaped thunder spirit, and a round thunder ball wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yan had already passed out from the thunder with her hands clasped against her chest and her eyes shut. Her long, black hair and slender legs hung loosely.</p>

  <p>"Haha! This woman has a special smell, indeed. My master will like her."</p>

  <p>He laughed wildly as he sized up the others. "It's rather strange… I'm naturally disgusted at the very sight of you. It would seem that I have a desire to kill you all. What's going on?</p>

  <p>But I still feel like something's wrong. If I kill you, I will probably disappear.</p>

  <p>This place is so weird."</p>

  <p>Edmond had asked Atlas to explore the debate venue where he saw many fear incarnations together with a large group of top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>But thanks to his cleverness, he had already sensed the strangeness of the place— he remembered very clearly that he had died, so his revival was nothing short of abnormal. He didn't kill anyone— he merely passed there when he sensed Yan's special aura. He wanted to take her away to give her to Edmond.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Yan with her eyes tightly shut, Zheng's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"A consummate True God!"</p>

  <p>Both Reinhard's and the soybean-eyed guy's hearts sank.</p>

  <p>The fear incarnations in the debate venue were all too powerful to deal with.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Spirit alone couldn't be killed soon, it would kill everyone in sight.</p>

  <p>When the Multiple Antennae Snake appeared, all anyone could do was escape.</p>

  <p>And now a consummate True God had appeared.</p>

  <p>"Put her down," Zheng said with a voice like a growl.</p>

  <p>There was invincible dignity in his voice— a strong intention to kill began boiling within him, making him tremble all over.</p>

  <p>"What? You're just a low-rank True God. Your cultivation base should be the lowest among the group." Atlas gave Zheng an indifferent glance, fully intending to ignore him.</p>
