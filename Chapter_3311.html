<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult for the people in the Source World to influence or affect the events on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>They could only offer soul pills to strengthen the soul auras of those on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The people outside Dragon City, for instance, were able to cultivate on the Other Shore with the help of the starlight in Dragon City despite it being an external force.</p>

  <p>Flamine couldn't intervene and help Elvinia fight the creatures on the Other Shore. Nor could she greatly improve her daughter's cultivation base while Elvinia was on the Other Shore. However, she could kill anyone who tried to snatch Elvinia's soul.</p>

  <p>In a sense, one's Soul of Light was both in the Source World and on the Other Shore. Thus, after Teague entered the depths of Elvinia's Soul of Light, he was still on the Other Shore, yet he was also on the second floor of Zheng's house in the Flow Sword Sect in the Source World.</p>

  <p>This presented Flamine with an opportunity to help her daughter.</p>

  <p>Teague had not become a purified being yet, so his soul was still quite weak. Moreover, as a creature from Stage Thirteen of the Dark Region, he was inferior to the creatures in the upper stages of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Huge flames burned and flickered around Teague.</p>

  <p>He darted from left to right in a cage made of golden flames. Every time he tried to escape, the scorching heat forced him back inside.</p>

  <p>"I'm a purified being! You can't kill me!" Teague yelled in despair.</p>

  <p>Outside the cage, a faint shadow emerged. It was Flamine's soul. Elvinia's Memory Flame rested on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You certainly have the aura of a purified being," said Flamine, looking at Teague cautiously.</p>

  <p>There were many powerful creatures in the Dark Region, and the purified beings were the best of them. Once they were born, they were virtually impossible to defeat.</p>

  <p>However, it remained a great mystery how and why purified beings were born.</p>

  <p>"You can't kill me! If you kill me, the Blood Assembly will never let you go!" Teague roared at Flamine.</p>

  <p>"But you want to kill my daughter!" said Flamine, whose face darkened.</p>

  <p>Threatened by Teague, she was more determined to kill him now.</p>

  <p>She waved her hand, and the golden cage shrank, closing in on Teague. The bars of golden flames pressed in on Teague's soul. He screamed in agony at the scorching pain.</p>

  <p>Several seconds passed as Teague writhed and screamed. Eventually, he collapsed and fell silent. Flamine exhaled, thinking it was over at last.</p>

  <p>However, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>Teague's white soul began to swell rapidly. It expanded within the flaming cage, becoming larger and larger.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Flamine demanded, taking a step back.</p>

  <p>She tried to bind the expanding soul in place, but she couldn't hold it down.</p>

  <p>There was a deafening bang.</p>

  <p>Teague's soul exploded. In an instant, a violent, swirling vortex appeared in its place.</p>

  <p>Flamine stumbled forwards, drawn by the gravity of the vortex. She fought against it, but it was too strong. Her soul and Elvinia's orange Memory Flame were inexorably sucked in.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Flamine's soul had disappeared into the vortex.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, Flamine suddenly opened her eyes. She blinked and shook her head, looking furious. In a cold voice, she cried out, "How could this happen?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy had been trying to repair Zheng's body. When she turned to Flamine and saw the look on her face, her own expression grew dark and forbidding.</p>

  <p>Although Flamine had not explained what had happened, Dorothy could tell that things had gone wrong.</p>

  <p>Flamine put her fingers to her temples, and golden flames appeared, shooting upwards. Her eyes were red.</p>

  <p>She wanted to go into Elvinia's mind again. But she found that a white light had enveloped Elvinia's soul.</p>

  <p>The light seemed to have completely integrated with Elvinia's soul. It wouldn't be difficult to destroy the light, but the problem was that, given this degree of integration, destroying the light would also tear apart Elvinia's soul.</p>

  <p>The two tentacles lashed at Zheng's arms again.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt the intense pain of the cutting from the tentacles, but to his surprise, he also felt a sensation he couldn't immediately identify.</p>

  <p>He took a closer look at his arms and realized that they were healing.</p>

  <p>However, the healing could not keep up with the amount of damage being done to his arms. They were cut, broken, and bleeding.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that the tentacles would break his bones and rip his arms apart, and then enjoy the pieces slowly.</p>

  <p>He groaned at the terrible sound of the bones in his arms cracking beneath the tentacles.</p>

  <p>Zheng was overcome by agony. He was about to black out from the pain when, from outside the triangle cave, there was a loud roar.</p>

  <p>It sounded like hundreds of pigs howling together.</p>

  <p>'The pig-faced monsters...' Zheng thought, ashen-faced.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the tentacles stopped moving. To Zheng's surprise, he found himself being carried out of the cave by the tentacles.</p>

  <p>He realized that the pig-faced monsters had somehow stopped the tentacles from devouring him.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that the pig-faced monsters had not acted out of benevolence.</p>

  <p>After all, he had broken into their holy tomb, and they had tried to tear him limb from limb. They must be even more furious at him now that he had dug up and desecrated the tomb.</p>

  <p>The air whooshed in Zheng's ears as the tentacles swung him upwards.</p>

  <p>He was hung upside down outside the triangle cave.</p>

  <p>Everything was silent except for a dripping sound, as blood flowed down to the ground from the wounds on his arms.</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters stood in a line in front of Zheng's battered, upside-down body. He looked miserable, yet he endured his suffering, which stoked their hatred even further. They started to speak among themselves.</p>

  <p>"We can't let him die so easily!"</p>

  <p>"Anyone who desecrates the holy tomb must suffer the harshest torture!"</p>

  <p>"This filthy human must pay for what he's done!"</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters talked over each other, suggesting methods for punishing and torturing Zheng.</p>

  <p>While they were discussing the matter, the dark blue pig-faced monster reappeared. It went to Zheng and narrowed its eyes at him thoughtfully. After a moment it turned to the others and said, "Don't kill him."</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters let out howls of indignation. "What? Why not?"</p>

  <p>"This human has insulted us!"</p>

  <p>"He deserves to die a painful death!"</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a stab of relief at the declaration of the dark blue pig-faced monster, but he was also confused.</p>

  <p>The monster had wanted to swallow him alive before. Now it wanted to spare his life? What reason could there be to keep him alive?</p>

  <p>The dark blue pig-faced monster glanced at Zheng and gave him a slow, malevolent smile. "We will use him as bait in the black pool!" And it laughed, its beady eyes lit with malice.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the other pig-faced monsters were quiet, thinking about the proposal. Then they joined the dark blue pig-faced monster in its laughter.</p>

  <p>"Good idea!"</p>

  <p>"That is a fitting consequence for the one who breaks into the holy tomb!"</p>

  <p>"He will suffer greatly!"</p>

  <p>The black pool was a forbidden area for the pig-faced monsters. Any creature sent as bait to the black pool would meet a dreadful end.</p>

  <p>Zheng was apprehensive. He had no idea what the black pool was, but he could tell from the reactions of the pig-faced monsters that it would not be a good idea to enter that place.</p>

  <p>The tentacles seemed to do the bidding of the pig-faced monsters. They took out two thick bronze iron plates, obtained from the valley, which were about the size of a human being. There was a hole punched into the center of each iron plate. The tentacles lifted Zheng down onto the ground. They slid Zheng's neck and hands into the holes in the iron plates, and then secured the plates with two ropes.</p>

  <p>Zheng struggled but he was very weak from his injuries. When he released his Other Shore Power, strange patterns flashed on the plates, but they stayed firmly in place.</p>

  <p>"Give it up. No one can escape from the bronze seal," a pig-faced monster sneered.</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored the monster, silently trying to break free. After several unsuccessful attempts, he finally gave up, deciding he was wasting his energy. He sat, trapped by the bronze seal, and stared morosely at the light column in the middle of the valley.</p>

  <p>Elvinia was still buried within the dark cave of the tomb. Her Soul of Light would have been entirely swallowed by the white shadow by now.</p>
