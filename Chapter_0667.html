<br/><br/>

  <p>However, Dennis could not bring himself to ask these questions. Besides, he had got the message from the cyan dragon, so he wouldn't dare to interfere with Zheng too much. Moreover, no matter what he thought about it, there was nothing he could do right now. Whatever it was in Dragon Abyss Palace head's mind, it was none of his business.</p>

  <p>While Dennis had somehow figured it out that it was all because of the cyan dragon, Elder Wei, Alan and Zack still had difficulty in uncovering the truth.</p>

  <p>They were still wondering why the head of Dragon Abyss Palace offered to give the Genuine Dragon Blood Essence to Zheng.</p>

  <p>But among the three, it was Elder Wei who felt particularly disgruntled.</p>

  <p>He was one of the lucky ones to get a drop of the Genuine Dragon Blood Essence as a reward for his significant contribution to the Dragon Abyss Palace. However, it didn't come on a silver platter. He had almost lost his life to deserve that kind of reward.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had just arrived in the Dragon Abyss Palace and hadn't proved anything yet, but still got a drop of Genuine Dragon Blood Essence as a gift. What was so special about Zheng that the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace had favored him that much?</p>

  <p>But despite his envy, Elder Wei believed that it must be Zheng's good luck that brought him that fortune.</p>

  <p>"It's a special gift, so it is just fitting for me to give it to someone who is truly worthy," said the head of Dragon Abyss Palace. She then turned to Zheng, beaming a smile and said, "Zheng, do you agree?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What you said is truly right," Zheng replied happily.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he took the munificent gifts from her hand.</p>

  <p>"Cyan dragon, do you think that she has noticed something about you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked the cyan dragon in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Probably. She's a smart woman, and she might have noticed something when you entered the level of Fighting Soul. But this is not the time to worry about it. I think she understands what she should do," the cyan dragon replied. His tone was rough and weak. He hadn't completely recovered from his fight with the Owl Beast ghost.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't think that the head of Dragon Abyss Palace would just give him the gift because of his great talent. She must have sensed the presence of the cyan dragon within Zheng, otherwise, she wouldn't treat him any differently.</p>

  <p>Acquiring the Genuine Dragon Blood Essence was a rare opportunity that no one would pass. And getting it without doing anything was a once-in-a-million chance. Zheng must have been truly lucky that the universe collided for him to get this rare opportunity.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately stored the Genuine Dragon Blood and Blood Essence in his space ring. At once, Dennis walked up to him and said, "Zheng, there's one thing I need to ask you about."</p>

  <p>"I'm listening, Sir," Zheng bowed to him with clasped hands. He wasn't sure what did he owe Dennis to get this attention. Or was he getting into trouble?</p>

  <p>"You were the last one who left the black ball, and you reached the level of Fighting Soul near the Owl Beast ghost. But after that, it disappeared from the Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock. Do you know what happened to it?" Dennis asked directly.</p>

  <p>Dennis had the feeling that Zheng had something to do with the disappearance of the Owl Beast ghost.</p>

  <p>Everyone had the same thought. It couldn't be just a coincidence that the Owl Beast ghost had disappeared simultaneously when Zheng had made the new breakthrough.</p>

  <p>Dennis couldn't still figure out why the Owl Beast ghost had just suddenly disappeared. It was bothering him for quite a while and now was the right time to finally know the truth. Despite reaching the Fighting Soul level, it would still be impossible for Zheng to defeat the Owl Beast ghost just like that. What could have happened to the Owl Beast ghost if it hadn't been killed by Zheng?</p>

  <p>Zheng had foreseen that this would happen when he agreed to the cyan dragon's request.</p>

  <p>But just as the cyan dragon had told him, Zheng played dumb in front of Dennis.</p>

  <p>"The Owl Beast ghost? I don't know, I just…" Zheng said with a confused look on his face. He stuttered to be more realistic. "When I heard the crack of the Thunder Lock, I saw the Owl Beast ghost jumping on me.</p>

  <p>That's all I could remember. After that, I lost consciousness."</p>

  <p>The part where he lost consciousness was true.</p>

  <p>When the cyan dragon destroyed the Thunder Lock, the influence of the Owl Beast ghost was released and overwhelmed Zheng. His soul could still not stand the impact of the Owl Beast ghost even if he had improved it.</p>

  <p>In the sixth circle inside the black ball, the pressure upon Zheng's soul was already thirty-two times stronger than that in the first circle. And when the Owl Beast ghost was freed from its chains, the pressure became stronger and harder to bear.</p>

  <p>The combined pressure from the sixth circle and the Owl Beast ghost's influence had made Zheng's soul almost split up. Luckily, the cyan dragon had activated the furnace on time and its colorful glow had repaired Zheng's soul. With the help of that mysterious colorful glow from the furnace, Zheng had managed to enter the level of Fighting Soul.</p>

  <p>"You really don't know?" Dennis asked again. He didn't believe that Zheng didn't know what happened. He could see through Zheng's eyes that the latter wasn't telling the whole truth. "You better tell me what you know because the Owl Beast ghost is an important treasure of our city. There must be something you know about the disappearance of the Owl Beast ghost."</p>
