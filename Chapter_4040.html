  <p>
</p>

  <p>King Ieuan stared intently at the metal branch for a while. Finally, it couldn't contain itself and blurted, "Zheng, what's the use of this thing?"</p>

  <p>Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess, and the Eternal Realm Hunters were curious.</p>

  <p>After all, they couldn't understand the conversation between Zheng and Campbell.</p>

  <p>"This metal branch can be used to make a Pure Sky Platform," Zheng answered. "It should also be able to repair this passageway."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Fuxi couldn't conceal the excitement in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Every cloud has a silver lining," the Snake Goddess said with a gentle smile. She wasn't surprised that Zheng's luck was taking a turn for the better.</p>

  <p>"I once sold two such branches," King Ieuan said wistfully. "Everyone thought that they were useless. They were so hard to sell!"</p>

  <p>Everyone glanced at King Ieuan speechlessly.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng was a little surprised, but he quickly understood why.</p>

  <p>The metal branches had an extraordinary appearance. According to Campbell, two thousand Eternal Twilight Seeds grew into metal branches at that time, but they were not able to form Pure Sky Platforms.</p>

  <p>These metal branches were difficult to destroy, so it wasn't unusual for them to show up on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If a creature obtained one, it was inevitable that they wouldn't be able to unravel the mysteries within, so their best bet was to just sell the metal branch. It was not strange that King Ieuan came across one or two of these in the past.</p>

  <p>What was important now was there was hope to repair the Pure Sky Platform, but first, they needed to leave the passageway.</p>

  <p>Campbell took everyone back through the passageway. When they reached the bottom, they reached a dead end. The entrance was nowhere to be found!</p>

  <p>"Boil the water," Campbell ordered.</p>

  <p>From Zheng's inner world, Zhurong was about to make a move but then Pearson suddenly said, "Let me do it."</p>

  <p>As he spread out his hands, blood red flames blossomed around his body.</p>

  <p>Like magic, the entrance that had vanished now reappeared!</p>

  <p>Everyone shuffled through the entrance and stepped into the cave. The pool in the cave was connected to the passageway, so the water in the pool was also boiling.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, take your companions out of the pool," Campbell barked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and took everyone to leave the pool.</p>

  <p>Once the last person had stepped out of the pool, Campbell stood on the surface of the water, his expression becoming extremely serious.</p>

  <p>He used to be an expert in building worlds, but he hadn't done this for many years.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>He put one hand in the pool and began to stir the water gently.</p>

  <p>Although his movements were gentle, the pool began to quake violently.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>Soon, a huge whirlpool was formed inside the pool, and it spun towards the entrance at the bottom of the pool.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Campbell raised the metal branch high above his head.</p>

  <p>He reached out to grab the air beside the metal branch. He didn't touch it, but it suddenly began to shake.</p>

  <p>Then, the look on his face grew more serious. He gently picked the metal branch, and then a white dot of light appeared on its bottom.</p>

  <p>"This light dot..." Zheng raised his eyebrows curiously.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, there shouldn't be any white light dots in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The only exception in the chaos should be the Cold Prisons, due to the extremely low temperature.</p>

  <p>But now, the metal branch broke this rule, which naturally surprised Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Campbell continued to pick, light dots appeared one after another. After these light dots fell into the whirlpool in the center of the pool, they were pulled into the entrance at the bottom of the whirlpool. From there, they drilled into the passageway to the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The others didn't understand what these dots of light entailed, but Zheng did.</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization continuously deciphered these light dots and transmitted a picture to Zheng's eyes. Then he saw that one end of the metal branch had grown rapidly and spread into the water, until finally it drilled into the bottom of the pool.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>As the water in the pool whirled faster and faster, more and more parts of the branch extended into the pool.</p>

  <p>In the others' eyes, they could only see more and more white light dots emerging.</p>

  <p>However, the passageway in the Jade Pure Realm underwent big changes.</p>

  <p>After the white light dots drilled into the Jade Pure Realm, they quickly formed a huge metal branch, which was still growing steadily. The metal branch quickly drilled through the broken parts of the passageway and grew all the way to the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>Then the metal branch became thicker and thicker, gradually filling the entire passageway.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>As the metal branch expanded, cracks appeared on the surface of the old passageway and chunks of it fell off, until all that was left of the broken passageway was a pile of debris.</p>

  <p>When the broken passageway collapsed, a shiny new metal branch appeared.</p>

  <p>There was no white light spot released from the metal branch in Campbell's hand, but the bud at the top of the metal branch was shining with a bright red light, as if it was about to bloom at any moment now.</p>

  <p>Once the bud bloomed, it would form a huge Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>However, if the Pure Sky Platform was formed here, the people present would be crushed to death.</p>

  <p>Campbell carefully sealed the bud up. The bright red light disappeared and was replaced with a dull grey color.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, can you give me the rest of the metal branch?" Campbell asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. "It belongs to you. I'm just returning it to its rightful owner. You don't need to ask for my permission."</p>

  <p>Campbell nodded and smiled back. After putting away the metal branch, he said, "The repair has been completed. You can go in now."</p>

  <p>Everyone once again jumped into the water and swam into the passageway along the brand new, glowing red path in the pool.</p>

  <p>The size and width of the passageway were exactly the same as before, but the inner wall looked very new. After all, it had just been completed.</p>

  <p>"Creak! Why is this new passageway also full of water?" King Ieuan asked as it swam upward.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess speculated, "Maybe the end of this passageway is connected to a water source. When the new passageway was formed, the water naturally flowed down quickly to fill the entire passageway."</p>

  <p>King Ieuan was somewhat skeptical. When it swam to the end of the passageway with the crowd, it was surprised to find that they ended up in another pool of water.</p>

  <p>When they finally reached the surface of the water, they all came out with a splash. As they took in their surroundings, their eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>It was just as the Snake Goddess said, they were in the center of a lake.</p>

  <p>The Night View Island was a very huge Pure Sky Platform. Although it was not as big as the main one, it was over a thousand times larger than the one Zheng and the others had been to before. The lake in the center of the island occupied more than half of its area.</p>

  <p>The lake was surrounded by grayish mountains. In the night, these mountains were like demons and monsters lying on the ground, emitting a quiet and unsettling aura.</p>

  <p>Although this place was not the main Pure Sky Platform, it was still within the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>According to the information they had obtained so far, the Treacherous Beings should come from the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>So it wouldn't have been surprising if they encountered powerful Treacherous Beings here in the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>After they left the surface of the water, they flew closely to the mirror like lake. Everyone, including Campbell, tried to move as quietly as possible, so as to not draw any attention to themselves.</p>
