<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2470 Be Overtaken </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once Duke attained a height of 800 feet, his speed also suddenly decreased greatly.</p>

  <p>After all, among the over one hundred top-rank True Gods present here, only Yan, Reinhard and the guy with soybean-like eyes had been capable of reaching such heights.</p>

  <p>"Humph, go on!"</p>

  <p>He mustered all his strength. The Dragon-head Silver Needle that pierced his chest now shone with brilliant, bright light.</p>

  <p>The whirlpool in his body spun faster and faster. It was dizzying.</p>

  <p>Under the cyan stone tablet, each of the seven people, including Tyrone and Ellis, took one pill and sat cross-legged on the ground.</p>

  <p>When Yan and Reinhard saw them, their eyes flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>Although they weren't sure why the seven men acted in such a way, it was clear to them that they had used some kind of method in order to help Duke.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng..." Yan muttered.</p>

  <p>She raised her head and looked at Luo Zheng in the air above her, her face filled with worry.</p>

  <p>Once Duke had reached 800 feet in height, his speed slowed down, sure, but he continued to climb upward at a steady rate.</p>

  <p>Despite seeing Duke push forward, Luo Zheng had almost stopped after reaching 750 feet.</p>

  <p>If Duke broke the record left by Yan using his real strength, there were high chances that they'd lose absolutely everything!</p>

  <p>This was the last thing that the Sword Clan and Harold wanted to see happen, of course.</p>

  <p>Although Yan rarely took the big picture into consideration, nor did Harold really ever allow her to make the final decision, she knew the seriousness of the situation.</p>

  <p>'If Duke really overtakes me and my brother fails, I'll just keep trying, '</p>

  <p>Yan thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Sensing Yan's nervousness, Reinhard said lightly, "Don't worry. There's still a little chance that Duke won't overtake you." He was trying to be encouraging.</p>

  <p>"Okay!" Yan nodded in reply.</p>

  <p>860 feet...</p>

  <p>870 feet...</p>

  <p>He reached 880 feet!</p>

  <p>Duke grasped onto and climbed up the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>As the daredevil of his clan, he had his back to the wall. He was more loyal than anyone else, and he was more aware of death than anyone else, too.</p>

  <p>What he wanted though, was to be alive and see his clan's ambitions and dreams become a reality in the world.</p>

  <p>He wanted to overtake Yan and obtain the inheritance for himself.</p>

  <p>In this way, he would be capable of saving his life and become one of the clan's masters in the future!</p>

  <p>What was more, he'd even have chances of becoming a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>How could he give up on such a chance? Such an opportunity?</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Once Duke had climbed to a height of 890 feet, the pressure from the cyan stone tablet immediately doubled. He could feel it relentlessly.</p>

  <p>When the terrifying pressure covered his entire body, he felt like a moth facing the wind. It was as if he could be blown down and away at any moment!</p>

  <p>"Gosh! Just calm down!"</p>

  <p>Duke kept his balance, as well as his cool.</p>

  <p>What he faced next was something he hadn't expected to fall upon. A giant gap separated him from his current height at 890 feet and the height he needed to get to, which was 900 feet.</p>

  <p>He finally understood why Yan had reached a height of 920 feet in a single breath after gathering as much of her strength as she possibly could. It was almost impossible for anyone to keep steady at this height.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng stopped at 700 feet. Clearly, he just has an unearned reputation. If I overtake Yan by reaching a height above her 920 feet... Then everything is mine. Everything!"</p>

  <p>Duke's eyes bulged. The blood streaks in his pupils spread quickly and the whirlpool in his body picked up even more speed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Tyrone and the other six people's faces turned paler and paler. Their breathing had slowed, and apparently, it had become labored as well.</p>

  <p>Among them, one of the True Gods who was a little weaker than the rest, suddenly got older in an instant. His face was covered with wrinkles and dark spots.</p>

  <p>That was why they were reluctant to use the Energy-extracting Needles.</p>

  <p>As soon as they inserted the Phoenix-head Golden Needles into their bodies, it equaled the same as giving their lives to Duke.</p>

  <p>Duke was extracting their cultivation base at high speeds, and they quickly swallowed and absorbed the pills like they hadn't cost any money. Despite doing so, stopping the negative effects of the Energy-extracting Needles was very difficult, if not impossible.</p>

  <p>"Up!"</p>

  <p>Duke suddenly dashed upward and successfully climbed another twenty feet higher.</p>

  <p>Now, he was 910 feet high. He had only 10 feet left to go before reaching Yan.</p>

  <p>"Only 10 feet away," Yan clenched her fists as she mumbled, a nervous look on her face.</p>

  <p>"Duke, come on! You can do it!"</p>

  <p>"You're only ten feet away from the record that girl has set!"</p>

  <p>"If you make it just a little further, then the inheritance of the debate venue will be ours! Go!"</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of wealthy clans were getting more and more excited. They couldn't help but egg Duke on.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that they would eventually put an end to the debate, which had lasted for countless years now.</p>

  <p>Even if they didn't obtain the inheritance, in their hearts, they still felt proud.</p>

  <p>Reinhard, on the other hand, was red with anger.</p>

  <p>His eyes were fixed on Tyrone and the others, who were sitting not far away.</p>

  <p>Duke must have used his magical means in order to gain such powerful strength. It made sense to conclude that these seven people had to be the key!</p>

  <p>"He who strikes first gains the advantage," said Solomon quietly through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Reinhard wasn't the only one who had seen the key. Solomon had also figured out their reason, too.</p>

  <p>Both the Sword Clan and the Luo Clan had already made up their minds.</p>

  <p>There was no way they were going back now!</p>

  <p>If they chose to start a fight first and succeeded in killing those seven men, they'd have much higher chances of stopping Duke.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Reinhard nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Although the disciples of the Sword Clan were benevolent, they were by no means considered soft-hearted people.</p>

  <p>Once Reinhard noticed the problem, he didn't hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the alliance of wealthy clans was also very quick to react.</p>

  <p>Wesley and Gino kept a close eye on the Sword Clan disciples. Never did they let them get out of their sight.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Reinhard took a single step forward.</p>

  <p>Wesley sneered and clapped his hands loudly. A red disk shot out expectantly.</p>

  <p>"The Star Disk!"</p>

  <p>On the other side, Gino casually waved his hand and a disk also appeared from behind him.</p>

  <p>"The Jade Disk!"</p>

  <p>On each of these two disks was an extremely powerful array.</p>

  <p>Even in the Dongfang Clan, the two disks were considered rare and precious treasures.</p>

  <p>In order to win in such a debate, the Dongfang Clan gave Wesley and Gino the two disks without hesitating in the least. It was obvious how badly they wanted to win this.</p>

  <p>Wesley and Gino weren't the only ones to take action, in fact.</p>

  <p>The True Gods of the union of wealthy clans, such as the Leng Clan, the Mu Clan, and the Tang Clan had also been preparing to make their respective moves.</p>

  <p>"If you want to fight, go ahead. We're ready and waiting!" Wesley sneered, his nose raised in the air.</p>

  <p>Although Duke was afraid of Yan and Reinhard, they still had a few advantages, thanks to the union of wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>Whether in strength or in quantity, never had they feared the Sword Clan before.</p>

  <p>As for the other True Gods of humble origins as well as the other members of the wealthy clans, they just quietly retreated to the side.</p>

  <p>They didn't want to get involved for no reason.</p>

  <p>Yan's tiptoe tapped on the ground a few times and she immediately floated three feet above the floor below her. With a flick of her finger, she asked quietly, "Do you really want to fight against them?"</p>

  <p>Reinhard felt kind of hesitant.</p>

  <p>Just as he was thinking about whether to fight or not, everyone heard Solomon shout out loudly. Duke on the cyan stone tablet had finally broken Yan's record! Unbelievable!</p>

  <p>As Yan, the soybean-eyed guy and the others saw that Duke had climbed above Yan's name, their hearts sank deep.</p>

  <p>Now, their last and final hope was Luo Zheng. It was only normal that everyone was depending on him alone.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had barely made his way over the 700-foot mark. He was slowly but steadily making his way upward. It was a question of waiting and seeing whether he could reach 800 feet or not.</p>

  <p>They weren't the only ones feeling utterly nervous at this time.</p>

  <p>Harold, Marsh and Gibson were shocked to their core. They held their bodies stiff as boards.</p>
