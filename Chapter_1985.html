<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When a force of the human race reached its peak, it would form either a divine kingdom or a sacred place.</p>

  <p>The other races in the universe were about the same and approximately on the same level, but the Demon Night was rather special. Strictly speaking, the Demon Night was similar to the secret sect in the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>However, the secret sects in the Thoughtless Minds were only present for absorbing Faith Energy, and never developed to the point of being capable of ruling over a force. The larger and smaller secret sects were still there, serving the four great clans.</p>

  <p>As for the Demon Night though, they were under complete control of the three queens.</p>

  <p>Of course, the cause of this kind of social structure was in Murphy. His goal was to use his Soul-sealing Needle to have the three queens lead the Demon Night to rebellion.</p>

  <p>Yes, the Demon Night was absolutely loyal to their queens. However, they, as intelligent creatures, disagreed from the depths of their bones with their queens' actions.</p>

  <p>Xun, however, still hadn't returned to her throne. The Demon Night members couldn't disobey the orders given by the other two queens, and therefore had to brace themselves and follow them instead.</p>

  <p>Even though Fannie and Sammy belonged to the Saint Chain Sect, their hearts became agitated when they heard Luo Zheng speak.</p>

  <p>If they had a different queen, the Demon Night would probably thrive.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, both of them were sharing this same thought.</p>

  <p>Whether it was rational or emotional, they were willing to side with both the human race and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And yet, they equally couldn't betray their queens!</p>

  <p>The Demon Night's traitors were also known as "the queens' abandoned children", and would be regarded as the greatest disgrace to their clan. It was safe to say that a good majority of the Demon Night members would rather bear the most painful punishment than betray their queens! From the moment they were born, the pride of being a follower to their queens had already been engraved in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Thus, when this idea came to Fannie and Sammy, they felt frightened by their own thoughts. Coming from them, this kind of thinking was simply outrageous!</p>

  <p>Once the idea had been born though, it became impossible to restrain.</p>

  <p>The idea grew uncontrollable and went berserk.</p>

  <p>"We... We won't, we can't betray our queens," Fannie stated and shook her head stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Not now, but who knows what will happen in the future," said Luo Zheng in a flat tone, looking up at the sky.</p>

  <p>In the air above the sea, his eyes had settled on a massive black cloud.</p>

  <p>This cloud had gathered on the Prison Island, forming a storm of its own.</p>

  <p>A Rain of Pain was falling…</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Luo Zheng rose up from the ground in a brisk motion, his hands violently spiraling.</p>

  <p>The nine stars in his body slowly rotated and an invisible force began circling between his two hands.</p>

  <p>The power of the attack suddenly struck out, distorting the surrounding space!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clenched his fist and quickly punched it toward the sky.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound came from above.</p>

  <p>The black cloud once hovering atop the Prison Island was instantly torn apart by this tremendous force. Like shredded cloth, the cloud dispersed almost immediately in strips that scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>Seconds later, the storm had completely dissipated, and the falling black rain had stopped.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lowered his head and swept his gaze over the two world lords. His figure suddenly flashed as he charged toward another pillar!</p>

  <p>Fannie and Sammy obviously knew what Luo Zheng was attempting to do.</p>

  <p>Sammy frowned as she tried to rush over. Before she got anywhere though, Fannie reached out and grabbed her. She shook her head and said, "You can't stop him…"</p>

  <p>"B-but...," Sammy stammered. "We can't let him do that!" Sammy was now shouting angrily.</p>

  <p>Fannie stood her ground though, shaking her head. "The current situation isn't something we have control over anymore. Maybe… maybe what he said was right."</p>

  <p>There was no right or wrong when it came to racial conflict. From the Demon Night's perspective, Luo Zheng was definitely their enemy. But just now though, Luo Zheng had greatly influenced them with Xun's Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sped toward another pillar. On this one, a Demon Night world lord was bound tightly.</p>

  <p>From the pillar, the world lord raised his head to look up at the dissipating black cloud, his eyes revealing a look of astonishment. It seemed to him as though the cloud had been dispersed by a person, but how could something like that happen here on the Prison Island?</p>

  <p>While he was still trying to process his astonishment, an extremely fast figure dove over from the side and stopped right in front of him.</p>

  <p>"What? Could it be? A human being?!" The world lord's facial features were now distorted with confusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand gently and the vine binding the world lord broke apart. He didn't pause a moment longer before moving on to the next pillar in line.</p>

  <p>The people he was rescuing were all prisoners of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Moreover, those who were locked up on the Prison Island were said to be great sinners to the Demon Night. They were thus imprisoned here for a variety of strange reasons.</p>

  <p>Many of them had high cultivation base; most of them were at the Spirit Transformation Realm, and another portion of them were even world lords!</p>

  <p>After being rescued though, the Demon Night members were still extremely weak. Thanks to their cultivation base however, they recovered their strength quite quickly. It wasn't before long that a few of the world lords regained enough of their mobility to head toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And that was when Amber also decided to stand up. She looked around at her clansmen, who were slowly closing in on her. She didn't say anything because she had no idea what Luo Zheng was planning to do.</p>

  <p>The gathered members of the Demon Night now glared at Sammy and Fannie, hatred written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>No matter the reason why these Demon Night members were imprisoned here, Yao would always remain the root cause. Therefore, these martial artists held a great enmity towards the Saint Chain Sect; and they only instinctively held a hostile attitude towards Sammy and Fannie as well.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members' strength hadn't completely recovered: The life vitality in their bodies hadn't yet condensed and the ability to take action was still nonexistent.</p>

  <p>Once everyone from the Demon Night on the Prison Island had gathered, Luo Zheng looked around and asked, "Are you willing to follow me?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you? And why did you save us?" a world lord of the Demon Night asked bewildered, staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"We, the Demon Night, will not follow a human," stated another world lord, speaking for everyone.</p>

  <p>Despite being in such a terrible situation, the Demon Night members still remained noble. Even in dire straits, together, they would face it very gracefully. They might have had nowhere to go, but there was no way in hell that they'd casually follow a human.</p>

  <p>BUZZZZ...</p>

  <p>The red light in Zheng's eyes flickered slightly. In this type of position, he knew his only option was to use Xun's soul once again.</p>

  <p>"What if I can represent the Queen of Killings?" Luo Zheng asked, with confidence in his voice.</p>

  <p>"You're..."</p>

  <p>"Humph! How could a mere human world lord represent our queen?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a second! Why do you suddenly have our queen's Mu Ning? How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>On the Prison Island, there were quite a few warriors from the Saint Spear Sect, and they had supported Xun the entire time. What was more, they had originally been sent to the Prison Island by Yao because they kept resisting.</p>

  <p>They were familiar with Xun's Mu Ning, which was an impossible one to fake!</p>

  <p>"Because he is  Luo Zheng Luo, and our queen is attached to him!" Amber suddenly said, in a matter of fact tone.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Amber's words, all of the Demon Night's martial artists present immediately figured out what exactly was going on. Their eyes each filled with awe as they looked at Luo Zheng in amazement.</p>

  <p>Although they were imprisoned here, the verbal battle between Luo Zheng and Yao had spread throughout the entire universe several years ago, and they too had heard it clearly. Luo Zheng was Amber's hope, and similarly, he was also their sliver of hope. If Luo Zheng were to return with Xun and even helped her return to her throne, then they would someday be free from oppression.</p>

  <p>"If our queen's soul still exists, why can't she show herself?" asked one of the world lords.</p>

  <p>It was true that in the past, Xun could show herself in the form of the sword spirit.</p>

  <p>This time though, she was nothing more than a soul fragment attached to Zheng's body. She had even lost her memories. But then, how was it possible for Luo Zheng to make her show up?</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong with her soul..." Luo Zheng couldn't explain it thoroughly. If Xun hadn't erased the Soul-sealing Needle, she'd have ended up being just like Yao, who chose to be the entire universe's enemy at all costs. However, erasing the Soul-sealing Needle caused her to lose all her memories.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued, "If you're willing to follow me, I will take you to meet someone, an important man!"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Is he a member of our Demon Night?"</p>

  <p>The people of the Demon Night pressed on with their questions, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head and replied, "A Supreme Lord of your Demon Night, Leroy."</p>

  <p>The three queens were the true leaders of the Demon Night, but Supreme Lord in the Demon Night wasn't anything to be scoffed at either. As a member of the Demon Night, Supreme Lord Leroy had both a high status and great charisma.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid Yao's encirclement, Supreme Lord Leroy went into hiding. He thus remained in hiding for many, many years, never revealing himself until now.</p>

  <p>The crux of the issue was that Supreme Lord Leroy also belonged to the Saint Spear Sect. Most of the people present were members of the Saint Spear Sect, so they were naturally eager to see Leroy in person.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" someone asked again.</p>

  <p>"I want to see him!" another warrior cried.</p>

  <p>Everyone expressed their utmost desire to see Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>Finding this Supreme Lord was already a part of Zheng's plan. He nodded to the crowd and said, "Everyone, follow me and I will lead you directly to Supreme Lord Leroy!"</p>
