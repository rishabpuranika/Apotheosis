  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The son of the plane?" Zheng was momentarily stunned upon hearing Xun's words. What did she mean by that?</p>

  <p>"The great world that you live in can be seen as a separate plane. It is its own entity. Just as the stars have their own wills, so does this great world," Xun explained patiently.</p>

  <p>The will of a great world was not of a single mind. Rather, it was a mirror reflecting the wills of all living beings. Their lives and desires intertwined, creating an aggregation.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the living beings were the humans, and so the son of the plane took their form, even if not entirely. There were some small details that differed from that of an ordinary human's physique, such as his forked tongue, wolf-like sharp teeth, and pitch-black pupils, accounting for the space meant for other living beings.</p>

  <p>Not every great world would have its son. It was born through destruction. Only when irreversible damage had been dealt, it would show its presence to repair the great world.</p>

  <p>"If my guess is correct, this little monster should have been born in this great world with the mission to repair the path to the Upper World,"</p>

  <p>Xun concluded.</p>

  <p>Her deductions were correct. The path to the Upper World had been destroyed by the Genuine Dragons, so the Soul Sea Realm masters had no way of ascending. It was because of this that this monster, or the son of the plane, was born.</p>

  <p>Despite her understanding of the situation, Xun knew there was something amiss. "This monster must be this great world's incarnation.</p>

  <p>However, his character is quite strange," she continued. "There must have been a lot of deviations in the process of his growth." She shook her head as she looked at the creature.</p>

  <p>When a great world needed restoration, the son of the plane would appear by chance in the form of a living being. He would be born naturally, like any other creature, and go through the stages of his own lifetime. Only after he had reached adulthood would his mission be revealed to him. Then, he would draw from the plane's power to repair the great world.</p>

  <p>Just as Xun had deduced, the little monster had indeed lived through a long and torturous life. Having been born hideous, he had been abandoned after his birth in the Seven Water Forest.</p>

  <p>No beast had touched him. They had instinctively recognized his true identity and raised him as one of their own kind.</p>

  <p>But the peace would not last for long. The warriors of the Nine Furnace Martial House entered the Seven Water Forest to cultivate, and in doing so, killed the vicious beasts. Seeing his kind fall down one by one at the hands of humans had awoken an unforgiving wrath in him and his heart had completely turned against the creatures that had once abandoned him.</p>

  <p>Xun only smiled wistfully and said, "Well, this is still a good chance for you. The son of the plane is the embodiment of the will of this plane, and he carries the will of the entire plane. If he uses his own life vitality, he will release the great world's natural talent, which can help you improve your cultivation base. Even the Lucky Light in the Dragon Soar Arena and the Tower of Sin would fall behind to its effect."</p>

  <p>The Lucky Light in the Dragon Soar Arena and the Tower of Sin was useful for all races, but the natural talent released by the incarnation of the plane was a fusion of all the natural laws. And since Zheng was born in this plane, its potency would be even better.</p>

  <p>"Alright. I understand it now," Zheng said as his eyes flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Focus on prolonging the battle. The longer you fight him, the greater the benefit will be for you," Xun suggested.</p>

  <p>The little monster watched from the side as Xun quietly instructed Zheng. Zheng's anticipation did not escape him. Seeing this, he grinned and said, "Since you've forced me to use my life vitality, I'll make sure to pay you back in full with a good fight!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he said these words, the monster's life vitality burst forth in a blinding ray of light from his hand. Obscure laws sprung from his life vitality, like an ancient, obsolete language that no one could decipher.</p>

  <p>His golden life vitality morphed into a long spear— its blades cutting through the air and shooting towards Zheng with a sharp whistle.</p>

  <p>The spear had extraordinary power, and it would be wise of Zheng not to face it directly. With a sudden twist of his body, he turned, effectively dodging the attack.</p>

  <p>The spear dashed forward, flying past the enchanted barrier created by a master at the Soul Sea Realm. Zheng's eyes widened as he saw the blade puncture the enchanted barrier. Previously, even the Phoenix's Nirvana Flames were unable to even make so much as a scratch, but the golden spear was so powerful that it pierced directly through the barrier.</p>

  <p>Astonishment was written all over the face of the Soul Sea Realm master who had created the enchanted barrier. Then, with a quick wave of his hand, the hole that had been made by the spear instantly vanished.</p>

  <p>Even the masters at the Soul Sea Realm could not fully comprehend what was happening before them. All they understood was that it was one of the monster's many mysteries. The obscure laws that were contained in his life vitality seemed able to counter all kinds of powers.</p>

  <p>It was not so much that the long spear was powerful— it would not have been powerful enough to pierce through the enchanted barrier on its own.</p>

  <p>However, the laws contained in it directly dissolved the life vitality within the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Of course, they did not know that the monster was actually the incarnation of the plane. Even the little monster himself didn't know it.</p>

  <p>His body contained all the natural talents of this great world, which included all the natural talents of human beings.</p>

  <p>In other words, the monster had an almost absolute power over this great world.</p>

  <p>The monster was only at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but he would be able to defeat most Life and Death Realm warriors without difficulty. Only the masters at the Soul Sea Realm would still be able to suppress him.</p>

  <p>A Soul Sea Realm master had his own unique domain which followed its own rules. If the rules were powerful enough, it could disrupt and weaken the connection between the great world's will and the monster.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it was only at present that the Soul Sea Realm masters could control the little monster. Their timing had been fortunate. Once the monster grew stronger and reached the Life and Death Realm, things would be very different.</p>

  <p>The little monster looked at the spear approvingly. It had declared his strength very clearly. As of the moment, the monster had not yet awakened to the will of the great world. He was no different from a savage fiend. His anger fueled him, kept alive by the memories of his bloodstained past. He killed off warriors mercilessly, reveling in the way their bodies distorted and their voices rang with agonized screams. It had been his sport— one whose excitement was quickly wearing thin as his prey proved not to be much of a challenge. He had been restless and bored. Then Zheng came in the picture like fresh game— his blood pumping with life and energy. He would be a worthy opponent.</p>

  <p>The monster licked his lips as he eyed Zheng with crazed bloodlust. "Great!</p>

  <p>Let's continue!" he shouted, then burst into wild laughter. His golden life vitality poured out from his body like a tidal wave, creating more golden spears which headed straight to Zheng's direction. "Now, let's see you dance, shall we?" he bellowed.</p>

  <p>Zheng dodged the golden spears carefully, and noticed some golden specks of light coming out from them. Deciding to take a risk, he tried to absorb them and, to his surprise, they flowed inside him, in a way that was very much similar to the Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>"Xun is right!" Zheng muttered, his excitement increasing. His life vitality began to spin rapidly inside his body.</p>

  <p>The effects of the natural talents that leaked out from those golden spears were far more potent than the Lucky Light!</p>

  <p>Zheng had not moved forward from the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm for a long time. Back at the Tower of Sin, he could have cultivated himself to a top-level war lord, but he had chosen to return to the Central Region as thoughts of Yan plagued in his mind.</p>

  <p>After that, he had reached the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm in Cloud Hall and had not made any improvement since.</p>

  <p>Right now, his heart was pumping wildly, and Zheng knew it was not solely from the fight. He had a premonition that he was on the verge of a breakthrough, and with the help of all these natural talents, he knew he could not be far off from stepping into the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>"How does it feel? Not bad, right?" The little monster grinned fiendishly as he stared at Zheng. "Do you feel like your mind is clearer? Even your cultivation base is improving quickly. Your sense must be reeling from it," the monster said, then cackled once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't say anything in response. He continued to quickly manuever himself through the space to avoid the golden spears, and at the same time, absorb the enegy that they released.</p>

  <p>The monster knew that the energy he had released increased one's cultivation base. However, since he did not yet know the great world's will, he was ignorant to the fact that these lights were actually the natural talents.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York's face darkened as he watched the battle. This was far from the result he had hoped for. His goal, along with Marine's, was to kill Zheng by the hands of this monster. But now, the little monster was forced to use his life vitality, and things were beginning to work to Zheng's favor.</p>

  <p>"This man is absorbing the monster's magical energy!" some Soul Sea Realm masters exclaimed. They were unaware that the golden lights were natural talents, and they had called them magical energy instead.</p>

  <p>The little monster's natural talents were not inexhaustible. Once he used too much of that power, his life vitality would become gray and lose the effect it had in increasing one's cultivation base. In order to maintain its use, the Nine Furnace Martial House would secretly kill some geniuses every once in a while and feed their energy to the monster. Only then would his life vitality return to a golden color.</p>

  <p>In other words, the monster possessed the ability to devour talents from other warriors and then release them for his own use, allowing others to absorb them as well.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the monster had not intended to use his life vitality, but he was obviously no match to Zheng in physical strength. Now, after Zheng discovered the little monster's secret, he kept moving around the little monster, absorbing the magical energy from his life vitality. This was something that the War Emperor York had never even conceived possible.</p>
