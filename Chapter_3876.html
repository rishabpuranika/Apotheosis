  <p>
</p>

  <p>Right now, the Evil God's true body was with the members of the Black Ship hundreds of thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>After he successfully absorbed Usman's soul, he was constantly exploring his abilities.</p>

  <p>At present, he could sense the existence of the Source World, but the Source World was not responding to him. With his current strength, he couldn't use the power of the Source World yet, so he could only control the province he was in.</p>

  <p>Despite this, his combat effectiveness had increased to a higher level.</p>

  <p>He could now accurately block the attacks of the Snake Goddess, and counterattack using his avatar on the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Aren't you giving up? You can't kill me!" the Evil God sneered.</p>

  <p>If it was any other human junior, even if they knew that they had quite an advantage, they wouldn't dare to be so arrogant in front of Fuxi.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God was different. He was afraid of no one.</p>

  <p>"Let's see where your arrogance can take you!"</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the mark of the Eight Diagrams exploded on the surface of the Evil God's body and caused it to tremble violently.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the remaining boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province also shook wildly. Fuxi immediately recognized that the impact of his attack was deflated.</p>

  <p>His face darkened. He was attacking the Evil God with all his might but the power of his strike was being transferred.</p>

  <p>Like Usman, the Evil God also gained the ability to use the boundary wall to block his attacks.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, compared to Usman, the Evil God's technique and control were much better.</p>

  <p>Usman could only transfer the power that he received to a certain part of the boundary wall. With Fuxi's massive punch, he could easily make a big hole in it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Evil God was able to evenly distribute the power to every part of the boundary wall. That meant that it had a better chance of withstanding powerful attacks.</p>

  <p>Although the boundary wall had already been riddled with countless holes, there was still a huge part that remained intact.</p>

  <p>So far, the Evil God had been able to withstand even the strongest strikes that Fuxi threw at him.</p>

  <p>In Fuxi's mind, he was indeed wondering how the Evil God suddenly appeared and acquired Usman's power. But the greater problem was that the Evil God was more adept in using this power than Usman.</p>

  <p>"You know that it wouldn't be easy to kill me. But I could easily crush you!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God suddenly reached out his hand and materialized the long amber spear.</p>

  <p>Actually, the Black Ship didn't order him to intercept the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. He attacked them on his own volition because of the past grudges that he still held against them.</p>

  <p>First, he still bore a huge grudge against Luo Zheng. Second, he also badly wanted to get his revenge for what Fuxi had done to him at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>He would never forget how Fuxi had humiliated him in public.</p>

  <p>Now that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were right in front of him, he decided that it was the right time to retaliate.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the Evil God who was approaching rapidly with the amber spear, Fuxi stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>The mark of the Eight Diagrams appeared again on the surface of the Evil God's body. Fuxi's massive punch instantly exploded as soon as it touched the body of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>However, this time, the Evil God didn't transfer the power of Fuxi's punch into the boundary wall. He migrated it into the end of his amber spear.</p>

  <p>He used Fuxi's own power as a weapon against him.</p>

  <p>The force of hundreds of thousands of Jun gathered at the end of the spear. The Evil God didn't need to throw the spear. With the power it contained, it left his hand and darted towards Fuxi at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Fuxi didn't expect that the spear would rush towards him at such a fast speed in that short distance, so it was too late when he began to dodge. The spear instantly pierced through his right chest, leaving a huge bloody hole.</p>

  <p>With a wave of the Evil God's hand, the spear flew back into his hand. He stared at the pitiful state of Fuxi with a devilish grin.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's quick-wittedness was able to drive Fuxi to his limits.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Snake Goddess caught a glimpse of the situation. She immediately went to Fuxi and grabbed Luo Zheng's body from behind him.</p>

  <p>Her body flickered again and appeared in front of the Evil God this time.</p>

  <p>Without any warning, she quickly raised Luo Zheng's body and smashed it down on the head of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>At such a close distance, the Evil God didn't think twice. He didn't dodge the attack, but immediately turned the tip of his spear towards her.</p>

  <p>He thought that he could also use the power of the Snake Goddess, transfer it to his spear, and use it against her.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess had something else in mind.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng's body touched the spear and the body of the Evil God, they quickly softened and gradually turned into amber-colored liquid. Then, Luo Zheng's body quickly absorbed the liquid.</p>

  <p>The amber liquid was a kind of energy, and the boundary wall was made up of this energy and the Space Law. In essence, it was completely made up of energy.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng's body could absorb any kind of energy, it instantly devoured the amber liquid.</p>

  <p>In no time, the avatar of the Evil God and the highly-condensed spear were both consumed.</p>

  <p>"Fuxi, let's go!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess turned around and looked at Fuxi with disappointed eyes.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Fuxi could be too reckless. If he had just kept his cool, he could have used Luo Zheng's body to block the spear just as what the Snake Goddess did.</p>

  <p>Fuxi shrugged his shoulders and readied to set off with the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>However, just when both of them were about to leave the Separate Amber Province, fluctuations occurred in the space surrounding them. Then, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven came out of the space channel.</p>

  <p>"Whoa! These fakes are very like their real selves," the Grandmaster of Heaven said as soon as he saw Fuxi and the Snake Goddess. "Well, in the end, they're just fakes. Since they dared to steal something that belonged to me, they deserve to die!"</p>

  <p id="top_1">"Yeah. I hate deception the most!" Claire chimed in with a ferocious smile.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the two wouldn't let them go without a fight, Fuxi smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>Since they wouldn't let them escape easily, they might as well have a good fight. Besides, he hated it when people referred to him as a fake.</p>

  <p>"Fake, huh? Then let's see how you'll get crushed by the strength of a fake!"</p>

  <p>While Fuxi's vicious eyes were fixed on the Grandmaster of Heaven, he stretched out his hand and grabbed the air. Immediately after, an Eight Diagrams disk appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>He then threw the Eight Diagrams disk in the sky. It constantly grew as it absorbed the wind, turning into a huge Eight Diagrams disk that floated in the air.</p>

  <p>As the Eight Diagrams disk spun, Fuxi's aura also drastically changed.</p>

  <p>Even when he was fighting with the Xuanyuan, he didn't use all his strength.</p>

  <p>But now, since they were facing two people who were much stronger than them, he had no choice but to go all out.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the shadow of Snake Goddess was also growing. Countless tentacle-like energy beams surged out and attacked the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire at the same time.</p>

  <p>Although the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess was extremely terrifying, its speed was subpar to that of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire. That was why both of them easily avoided her attack.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire rushed towards the Snake Goddess after they successfully avoided her energy beams.</p>

  <p>Just a bit earlier, these two powerful beings were fighting desperately against each other, but now they were temporarily working together.</p>

  <p>However, before they could approach the Snake Goddess, a huge shadow suddenly appeared from the sky above them. A gigantic tail with a poisonous needle emerged and shot fiercely at them.</p>
