<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4048 The Thorny Treacherous Being </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Half Treacherous Being?"</p>

  <p>Everyone wore strange expressions of mingled shock, calculation, and curiosity.</p>

  <p>The literal meaning of the sentence was not difficult to understand.</p>

  <p>But the question was, which side would dominate? Would the body be ruled by the mind of the human, or the mind of the Treacherous Being?</p>

  <p>When Campbell had possessed Zheng's body, Zheng had been unable to resist his will at all. Campbell completely dominated the human body. Thus, everyone was inclined to think that becoming half human and half Treacherous Being was the equivalent of suicide.</p>

  <p>"If one merges with a Treacherous Being, aren't they afraid that the Treacherous Being will suppress their consciousness and rule over them?" the Snake Goddess asked, voicing everyone's main concern.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's possible," Decker admitted. He explained, "When some Treacherous Beings of the friendly type wake up, some will snatch their hosts' bodies, and others won't. However, the Treacherous Beings' power is very strong. It's worth taking a risk."</p>

  <p>Decker's words made some sense.</p>

  <p>Indeed, there were creatures who wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice their very lives in order to obtain greater strength and power.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded. She asked, "You mention a 'friendly type' of Treacherous Beings. Could you explain what you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"They are kindhearted Treacherous Beings, harmless to others," Decker replied. "These good Treacherous Beings are willing to help others, and this is their will. For example, the Treacherous Beings in the form of sloths in the forest are among the friendly-type ones."</p>

  <p>The sloths were tireless in applying the Ghost Powder on the surface of the trees, to prevent the trees from being devoured by the white-haired monsters.</p>

  <p>Moreover, after they saw Zheng and the others in his group, they had also brought out the Ghost Powder to remind them to apply it.</p>

  <p>But Zheng and his companions were still wary of the sloths, and found it difficult to trust them completely.</p>

  <p>Pearson's eyes were blank. His face was expressionless as he lifted one hand, gently holding up the length of silver thread. The other end of the thread was tightly wrapped around the necks of Decker and Graham.</p>

  <p>Pearson wanted to kill one of them, so that the remaining one wouldn't dare to lie to them.</p>

  <p>Decker was smart enough to see what Pearson intended, so he didn't dare to hide anything from them. He told them everything he knew, but Pearson clearly still had doubts. "The white-haired monsters will also devour those plants. You can directly cut the trees and pick the flowers in exchange for the 'Arcana'," Pearson said flatly. A cold light flashed in his emotionless eyes. "Why did you deceive us into coming here?"</p>

  <p>"The white-haired monsters will indeed devour plants, but devouring plants won't produce 'Arcanum'," answered Decker quickly.</p>

  <p>Pearson shrugged. Fuxi stepped forward and asked, "Have any of you merged with a Treacherous Being and become half human and half Treacherous Being?"</p>

  <p>Since entering the Supreme Pure Realm, Fuxi had felt that his strength was completely insufficient.</p>

  <p>Although he had the Light of Annihilation, it was not enough. In fact, for most of his time in these two realms, he'd ended up running for his life.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the idea of becoming half human and half Treacherous Being intrigued him, as it presented the possibility of obtaining more power.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of our Wooden Leaf race all are half human and half Treacherous Being," answered Decker.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Fuxi said, sounding surprised. His eyes widened, for he had expected a more conservative answer.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others also looked surprised.</p>

  <p>They had assumed that, at most, one or two members of the Wooden Leaf race had successfully merged with a Treacherous Being and become half human and half Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>But now Decker was telling them that all the warriors of the Wooden Leaf race were half human and half Treacherous Being, which was an incredible number.</p>

  <p>Pearson's eyes narrowed and he tightened his grip on the silver spider thread with increased vigilance. The thread tightened on Graham's and Decker's necks, and the blood which had already begun to dry now flowed out once more.</p>

  <p>"Don't? don't be nervous," Decker gasped, feeling blood dripping down his neck from the tight grip of the thread.</p>

  <p>Graham swiftly added, "There are variations in the levels of strength possessed by Treacherous Beings. Our Wooden Leaf race is relatively weak, so the Treacherous Beings we merged with are not that strong."</p>

  <p>Pearson's grip loosened slightly. "You're right," he said. "Otherwise, you wouldn't have fallen into this situation."</p>

  <p>"Then prove your words," Zheng ordered. He was not worried that this command would cause any problems for him and his group.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng had already managed to kill the three stone men who were also half human and half Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>The skills of the Wooden Leaf race were centered on archery, not direct combat. They were not much stronger than the stone men, since the space here was limited, and they could not bring their strength into full play.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's instruction, Pearson loosened the silver spider thread even further. The leader of the race, Graham, felt much better. He lifted his hand to touch the thread still wrapped around his neck.</p>

  <p>With the silver thread tied around him, Graham walked several steps, towards the center of the cave. He took out a small glass bottle from within the folds of his clothing. This glass bottle was made of "Arcana", and it contained a small thorny ball, which was a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"Can I use arrows?" asked Graham.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. He gazed at the thorny ball within the glass bottle and said,</p>

  <p>"But doesn't the Arcanum need to be refined within one's body?"</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Beings that haven't woken up are not suitable to stay inside one's body for a long time," Graham explained. "Otherwise they will affect the warrior's body and mind."</p>

  <p>Most Treacherous Beings released an aura that would make other creatures very uncomfortable. Even the sloths, which were supposedly the friendly type of Treacherous Beings, had such an aura. Only the Treacherous Beings that had woken up would not make people feel disgusted.</p>

  <p>Graham lightly knocked on the glass bottle, and the shrunken thing in the bottle began to expand and flow out. The Treacherous Being resembled a sea urchin in shape.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched silently, and the only sound came from the movement of the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>The fluid-looking sea urchin stretched and flowed into Graham's eyes, ears, mouth and nose. It seeped like liquid into the orifices, until it was all gone.</p>

  <p>Then Graham blinked and took out a bow and arrow. His old bow had been crushed so this was a different weapon.</p>

  <p>Although this was only intended to be a demonstration, everyone stared at Graham with alertness.</p>

  <p>After all, he was going to display the power of the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>He raised the bow and fitted the long arrow into the string. A white light gathered in his right hand as the aura of the Treacherous Being concentrated in that spot. Graham aimed his arrow at the wall of the cave and said, "The Treacherous Being I merged with is very suitable for archery. When I shoot it out, it will cause a strong destructive force."</p>

  <p>With that, he released the bowstring in his hand.</p>

  <p>The arrow shot forward.</p>

  <p>As the arrow flew, the white light soared forward, converging into the point of the arrowhead.</p>

  <p>With a crack, the arrow hit the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>It created a small hole as it entered the wall and burrowed inside the stone.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others watched calmly.</p>

  <p id="top_12">It was true that the mountain walls in the Jade Pure Realm should be very difficult to destroy, but they themselves could achieve the same thing with a bow and arrow. It required the use of focused strength, and they thought that given a similar weapon, they could probably do more damage than Graham had done.</p>

  <p>However, in the next instant, a crack spread out from the tiny hole, and began to spread out along the surface of the cave wall.</p>

  <p>Everyone became more vigilant as the walls began to rumble.</p>

  <p>It sounded as though something was moving within the depths of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Graham was very familiar with the power of the thorny Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>He took a few steps back as the wall in front of him started to collapse. As the wall crashed, a large hole was revealed, and within it was the Treacherous Being in the shape of sea urchin.</p>

  <p>It had grown much larger. Its body had expanded at least a hundred times in size. Colorful thorns were embedded in the rock wall around the enormous sea urchin.</p>

  <p>This level of damage had been caused by shooting the Treacherous Being into the wall. If it had been shot into the body of a living being, they could only imagine the power of the resulting explosion.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked sharply at Graham. "All the Treacherous Beings you merged with are of this same type?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Graham nodded. "This kind of Treacherous Beings is our first choice. After we get enough 'Arcana', we each find such a Treacherous Being to merge with."</p>

  <p>When Pearson heard Graham's answer, his mouth twitched slightly. The fighting capacity of the Wooden Leaf race was not as bad as he had imagined.</p>

  <p>If they had fought with the Wooden Leaf race yesterday, they might win, but there might be some casualties. It seemed that Zheng and the Snake Goddess's plan was the best plan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and several others were more interested in merging with Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>After cultivating to the Eternal Realm, one's bloodline power couldn't change any more, and it became more difficult to find a stronger Other Shore Token. It looked like merging with Treacherous Beings was a shortcut to increase the level of one's strength.</p>
