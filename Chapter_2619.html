<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While Zheng was trying to break through to become a top-rank Wild God, No. 9527 was still up in the bone tower, carefully observing Zheng.</p>

  <p>It had found himself conflicted, wondering about how to best approach Zheng.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 didn't have much authority. From the very beginning, the task the brain masters had given to it was merely to keep an eye on Zheng and ensure that he remained alive.</p>

  <p>And it had performed its duty well so far.</p>

  <p>But now, the task had changed.</p>

  <p>The brain masters had ordered the brain units to pay close attention to this world's movements.</p>

  <p>The brain masters also knew perfectly well what had happened a few days ago.</p>

  <p>They were aware that the prisoners had dared to plan an escape from this world. They were incensed to hear such divergent ideas, and had since been on high alert.</p>

  <p>The brain masters, however, were not interested in the idea of leaving this place.</p>

  <p>After all, their top master was still sleeping. If they left, it would immediately wake him up. He would, however, never allow this world to become a prison to him.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Zheng's departure would cause trouble.</p>

  <p>After having waited for so many years, they were finally lucky enough to find a suitable guy. If they let him go, the sleeping master would wake up and find out, and all the brain masters would be doomed.</p>

  <p>Thus, those fat brain masters were extremely worried about Zheng and his intentions.</p>

  <p>Frustratingly, they couldn't interfere with Zheng or do anything to control him.</p>

  <p>They had considered imprisoning Zheng in this world, but after careful consideration, this turned out to be an unrealistic strategy. If what was said was true and he really had the ability to leave, their plan would be thwarted. It was too risky when the stakes were so high.</p>

  <p>The brain masters had been discussing this for a few days in the spiritual world.</p>

  <p>Usually, the brain masters could always make their judgments in an instant, as it was so effortless for them to communicate with each other.</p>

  <p>It was testament to how complicated this issue was that it took the brain masters a good few days to discuss it, in spite of the high speed at which they were able to communicate. Finally, they had come to an agreement.</p>

  <p>They would allow No. 9527 to approach Zheng.</p>

  <p>When it received this command, No. 9527 felt both great honor and great sadness.</p>

  <p>It was a great honor, because it had been entrusted with such an important task, which meant it would be granted higher authority since it was sort of the top master's substitute now. Evidently, its status and importance surpassed that of those brain masters it resented so much.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it was also a poignant moment for it. Despite feeling incredibly humbled by the trust of the master, it was sad to leave the spiritual world.</p>

  <p>It was its homeland, the only place where it had relatives and friends.</p>

  <p>At the moment, however, it had more pressing concerns on its mind. It was overcome with the kind of nervousness one felt before a first date.</p>

  <p>'When we meet for the first time, how should I greet him? Would he be scared? Or maybe he wouldn't care...' it thought, pacing around.</p>

  <p>While No. 9527 was planning its approach, Zheng's bones started to break apart again. He had begun his quest to become a top-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>"It is now..."</p>

  <p>With no time to hesitate, No. 9527 flew over the top of the cave at lightning speed. It could move freely and quickly in the bone tower.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>It did not take it long to enter the Cave of Wildness through the caves inside the bone tower. Landing on the ground, it rushed towards the sclerite shining in Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>When undergoing the Body Tribulations, Zheng focused all his senses on his own body.</p>

  <p>He felt the sclerite on his chest shift, but he didn't notice that a wisp of soul had got in.</p>

  <p>This time around, the Body Tribulations were much easier than the first time he had endured them. After all, Zheng already had some experience in dealing with them.</p>

  <p>Soon...</p>

  <p>The power of millions of wild bones, including fifty shares of blood wild bones, had been completely absorbed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng, once again, lay paralyzed in the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>Even after the Body Tribulations were over, Zheng couldn't move for some time. He could only wait in silence for his physical body to slowly recover enough to be able to move.</p>

  <p>As he lay, the silence was suddenly broken by a voice, a voice from within Zheng's own head.</p>

  <p>"Hello?"</p>

  <p>The sound had come so suddenly, out of the heavy silence, that it startled Zheng.</p>

  <p>He first thought that this was a voice message sent through the life vitality, but soon he realized that it was not. It was coming from the consciousness!</p>

  <p>"Who is that?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul replied in his mind, his breath quickening from anxiety. After all, no one wanted to become possessed.</p>

  <p>Even though many things had entered his body over the years, it was not something he desired or welcomed, especially not when it was of an unknown nature.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't expect that the situation would become too complicated this time.</p>

  <p>"My name is No. 9527," No. 9527 answered Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>By now, Zheng had deduced that the sound was coming from the sclerite in his chest.</p>

  <p>Zheng had always been very curious and confused about the origins of this sclerite. However, he had more important things to worry about than the provenance of a bone fragment. He would never have guessed, however, that it would be able to speak.</p>

  <p>"I just told you, didn't I? I'm No. 9527!" it replied, its voice puzzled.</p>

  <p>Zheng had asked it the same question twice.</p>

  <p>Although it had observed the behavior of groups of Wild Gods countless times, it still couldn't fully understand them. After all, it had been born in the spiritual world. Although it had its own consciousness, it didn't have much experience in dealing with people.</p>

  <p>It was not a human soul...</p>

  <p>Zheng made a decision quickly.</p>

  <p>As Zheng had already had some experience with these uninvited guests that entered his body, he knew what to ask. "Where did you come from?" he continued.</p>

  <p>"The spiritual world, the spiritual world the master has built. The world is buried deep underground," No. 9527 tried to explain clumsily.</p>

  <p>"Who is the master?" Zheng asked patiently.</p>

  <p>"Master?" No. 9527 thought for a while and finally gave the answer that Zheng was looking for. "The master is the Chaos Ancient God you always refer to."</p>

  <p>"The Chaos Ancient God!" Zheng was shocked. "The Chaos Ancient God you mentioned is this bone tower?" he asked hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>Zheng was silent for a while. He had never expected that this sclerite would have a connection with the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>There were so many Wild Gods and exiles in this world. Why would the Chaos Ancient God choose him?</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Zheng asked again, "Then why did you enter my body? What is this sclerite?"</p>

  <p>"Because the brain masters ordered me to do so," answered No. 9527 simply.</p>

  <p>This answer confused Zheng. He wasn't completely sure he had grasped what the brain masters were.</p>

  <p>Only after a long and tedious conversation had Zheng gradually understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>The first time he underwent the tribulations, he had actually been infused with the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God. Timotheus had known about this, even though he didn't tell Zheng.</p>

  <p>For some reason he didn't yet know, the brain masters that No. 9527 mentioned chose him and ordered No. 9527 to enter his body.</p>

  <p>It had explained that its goal was to help Zheng reach the Other Shore Realm with the cultivation method of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>The old man, Adele's father, had also mentioned this matter before, and this had put a glimmer of hope in Zheng's heart. Perhaps, if he took advantage of this shortcut, Zheng could reach the Other Shore Realm with his physical body.</p>

  <p>Now, this so-called No. 9527, who was a strand of Chaos Ancient God's soul, was repeating its own thoughts back at him.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but feel puzzled. "But I could reach the Other Shore by crossing the Sea of Truth using the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>What difference does it make if I use my physical body to reach the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"It makes all the difference," No. 9527 replied. "Using the Grand World Cultivation Method to reach the Other Shore, you can't take anything with you. But if you use your physical body to reach the Other Shore Realm, you can take back some important things of value from the Other Shore. There is a great difference between these two methods."</p>

  <p>This explanation stunned Zheng.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's mind, the Other Shore was a realm. Like the Sea of Truth, it should be a concept that people could only think vaguely about. It only existed in creatures' imagination, and thus was not real.</p>

  <p>But according to this guy's explanation, this did not seem to be the case.</p>

  <p>The truth was very different from what Zheng had anticipated.</p>
