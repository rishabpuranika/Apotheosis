<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Les's right hand flashed with bolts of lightning as he held onto Zheng's neck tightly.</p>

  <p>In the huge Thunder Array, whenever the countless flashes of lightning were squeezed together, they melted into a grey liquid.</p>

  <p>Anything thrown into the liquefied lightning would instantly melt and disappear without a trace.</p>

  <p>Under the attack of the liquid lightning, Zheng's body instantly reacted. Round blisters formed on his skin once more, oozing with a green viscous liquid.</p>

  <p>In defense, Zheng's skin formed a layer of metal to protect himself.</p>

  <p>This layer of metal completely isolated the lightning from the outside.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Les snorted.</p>

  <p>Then, the energy in the whole Thunder Array intensified and whirled around faster.</p>

  <p>In the liquid lightning that gathered, there were many small triangles wrapped in it. These triangles ground and drilled on the surface of Zheng's body. Cracks began to appear on Zheng's skin which glowed with metallic luster. His skin was gradually broken.</p>

  <p>"Even the ancestry-level bloodline can't resist them?" Zheng cried in shock.</p>

  <p>After all, from the moment he obtained the ancestry-level bloodline, Zheng saw infinite possibilities in it, and every possibility would be invincible.</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised, but so was Les.</p>

  <p>He had had no idea how Zheng formed a layer of metal on his skin, neither did he know what exactly that metal was. He just knew that his lightning lost its effect on Zheng the minute it appeared.</p>

  <p>In order to break Zheng's physical body, he had no choice but to use Thunder Crystal Fragments.</p>

  <p>A Thunder Crystal Fragment was the hardest material in the world. As they continued drilling on Zheng's skin, they finally breached past the metal layer and into Zheng's body. A smile crept on Les's face when he saw his plan was working.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Thunder Crystal Fragments, he was able to grind Zheng into powders.</p>

  <p>Just when Les thought he had the upper hand, a white mass suddenly oozed out of Zheng's wounds. It had a strange-looking mouth and hollow eyes, which stared into Les's.</p>

  <p>"This is..." Les's eyes widened slightly.</p>

  <p>It finally dawned on him why he had had such an unpleasant feeling.</p>

  <p>It was a Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>This guy was possessed by a Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>As one of members that held high position in the Element Spirit Civilization, Les knew much more about the Treacherous Beings than ordinary people. As a result, he was fully aware of how terrifying it was to be in this situation.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the Treacherous Being came out, two white hands encircled Les.</p>

  <p>"Hissss..."</p>

  <p>After the two hands twined around Les's body, a white film was formed, tightly enveloping him.</p>

  <p>Les's eyes darted back and forth, watching helplessly as he was being cocooned. Panic seized his heart.</p>

  <p>Desperately, he activated the Thunder Crystal Fragments once more to try to break free from the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Crystal Fragments were his trump card. To his horror, it had no effect on the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Try as they might, those tiny triangular fragments couldn't even make a crack on the white film.</p>

  <p>"Coo, coo."</p>

  <p>Les trembled at the creepy sounds. Then, a pair of hollow eyes emerged on the surface of the white film that enveloped Les. The strange-looking mouth appeared too, cracking an unsettling smile.</p>

  <p>Then the white film began to tighten gradually, squeezing Les little by little.</p>

  <p>From the other side, Claire and Slade both cried out in horror when they saw the Treacherous Being emerge.</p>

  <p>Who would have known Zheng ended up getting possessed by a Treacherous Being when he passed through the Whining Road?</p>

  <p>"It's a white hostility-level Treacherous Being, one of those on the Whining Road," Claire said. "I wonder if Les will survive..."</p>

  <p>Although Claire had teased Les playfully, she was under the impression he'd make it back alive. Now that the situation had taken a turn for the worse, she was a bit worried.</p>

  <p>"Well, too bad for him," Gavyn said with a smile. He was hoping Les would die, so that he could take his place.</p>

  <p>As members of the Element Spirit race, they had stayed on the Three Purities Stage for a long time and they knew more about the Treacherous Beings than ordinary Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>These Treacherous Beings were special spirits that were categorized into three levels: the hostility-level, the resentment-level and the hatred-level.</p>

  <p>The hostility-level was the lowest level among the three. Treacherous Beings at this level usually gathered in a fixed position, and they would act according to their own goals. They normally were not aggressive, unless someone provoked them or aroused their interest.</p>

  <p>Judging from the events that were unfolding, this Treacherous Being in particular was just acting in defense.</p>

  <p>However, once Zheng lay prone on the transparent ball, the Treacherous Being obviously took an interest in Les.</p>

  <p>So the reasons why it attacked Les might be both to defend itself and destroy Les.</p>

  <p>"Goo..."</p>

  <p>The white film continued to shrink, and the strange face on the white film was deformed because of the shrink, making it look even more grotesque.</p>

  <p>Originally Les stood fifty feet tall, but the white film shrunk him down to twenty feet, then ten, five...</p>

  <p>Les was a thunder spirit, but he had maintained his current form for countless years. Now that his body was being forcefully compressed by the white film, it ultimately collapsed.</p>

  <p>Even though Les's body had already broken down at this point, the white film showed no signs of stopping. In fact, it began to shrink even faster.</p>

  <p>Three feet...</p>

  <p>One foot...</p>

  <p>Five inches...</p>

  <p>Three inches...</p>

  <p>By now, the white film was nothing but a speck. Of course, the creepy face was gone, too.</p>

  <p>Upon a closer look, however, the white film was now a tiny cube.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven stared at this cube, they felt strange. Was it possible that Les had turned into a cube from being squished?</p>

  <p>Soon, however, they figured it out.</p>

  <p>When the white film was slowly shrinking, a small cubic stone was spat out. There were some cracks on it.</p>

  <p>Previously, the energy of Les's transparent light ball came from this small cubic stone. After being hit by Zheng again and again, the energy in the stone was exhausted, and the transparent light ball that served as a shield naturally collapsed.</p>

  <p>Everything disappeared under the compression of the white form, except for the small cubic stone.</p>

  <p>"I get it," the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly said. "Previously, when the Treacherous Being had manipulated your body to cling onto the transparent ball of light, it wasn't looking at Les but at the cubic stone beside him. It has taken a fancy to this thing..."</p>

  <p>"What's the use of this stone?" Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Of course, only something extraordinary would arouse the interest of a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"Coo, coo, coo..."</p>

  <p>Whatever remained of the white film suddenly melted into a puddle of murky white water which flowed until it formed the shape of the Treacherous Being. Its unsettling face emerged once more. This time, its smile was even wider and creepier than ever.</p>

  <p>Then, it howled...</p>

  <p>These howls were so shrill, everyone who had the misfortune of being within earshot winced in severe pain.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Wing King and the other warriors with him, as well as the men in black didn't have the time to clamp their ears shut, so they all buckled under the sound of the Treacherous Being's howls.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, this didn't last long.</p>

  <p>After a while, the howls stopped. The part of the Treacherous Being that was outside Zheng's body slowly returned, along with the small, cubic stone.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng had no control over his body, he didn't feel a thing when the cubic stone entered his body.</p>
