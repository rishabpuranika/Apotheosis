<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Latent Theurgy had a very unique history.</p>

  <p>Sixty years ago, Laura had managed to send an important person to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>As a reward, the Oneness Sky Palace gifted her the Latent Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Most of the Latent Theurgies would work automatically if their owners were in great danger. Now, however, Laura activated it herself.</p>

  <p>Once it had been activated, Laura's voice could reach every disciple's ear.</p>

  <p>"Don't struggle," she said.</p>

  <p>Stretching out her hand, she beckoned to them. As if by an invisible force, all the disciples were dragged towards her.</p>

  <p>Zheng also felt the invisible force on his body while flying in Laura's direction. Once he was fifty feet away from her, the Latent Theurgy above her head suddenly split into two.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Then, the two parts of the Latent Theurgy began to spread, and finally covered Laura, Ingram and all the disciples like a giant umbrella.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, Reynald could only sneer. "How naive!" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that this pathetic little trick is enough to keep me out?" he yelled, pointing at the umbrella-like formation.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A huge shadow of a sword appeared out of nowhere and lashed at the Latent Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Laura was not startled at all. She simply looked up at the falling blade calmly, as if it were a feather.</p>

  <p>A loud bang shook the earth, and with it, a blinding light flashed in the sky.</p>

  <p>It was so dazzling that it blotted out the sun and the entire sky.</p>

  <p>Slowly, the light began to dim. Once it had disappeared, everyone squinted at the sky, their eyes slowly recovering from the assault. Once they had regained their sight, they saw that the umbrella had remained unscathed.</p>

  <p>A mocking smile formed on Laura's lips. "This is the Heaven Earth Umbrella Master Goran gave me. You cannot break it, no matter what you do," she sneered.</p>

  <p>"Master Goran?" Reynald echoed, his face darkening.</p>

  <p>Goran was one of the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace, as famous as Athemar. He had few equals, and Reynald could only imagine how powerful his Latent Theurgy was.</p>

  <p>There was a silver lining in this for Reynald, however. He was secretly happy that Laura had used the Latent Theurgy for defense. If she had used some other Latent Theurgy to attack, he would have surely died.</p>

  <p>Feigning confidence, he looked up. "So what? This Latent Theurgy isn't eternal. How long will it hold up? Three days? A fortnight? A month? I am in no hurry," said Reynald in a brash tone.</p>

  <p>He was right. Most of the Latent Theurgies could only last for some time, until they disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>The disciples realized this too, and even Beldene and Elgin looked worried.</p>

  <p>Even though Laura's Latent Theurgy was immensely powerful, it was not long-lived. And once it disappeared, they would all be completely exposed.</p>

  <p>Death would be inevitable.</p>

  <p>Ingram, who was lying on the ground, wasn't worried at all. He was relaxed as a cat. "Reynald, you seem to have forgotten that the Oneness Sky Palace will send some people to pick up Zheng. They are probably on their way as we speak. Will you be able to deal with those guiders?" he mocked, his eyes half closed.</p>

  <p>Reynald seemed to freeze. He had heard about the extraordinary disciple that had been recruited by the Sword Light Palace, and that the Oneness Sky Palace would send some guiders to pick him up. Indeed, he had neglected to consider this.</p>

  <p>Yet, this wasn't as big a problem after all. "The Oneness Sky Palace doesn't know what happened to the Sword Light Palace yet. They are in the dark.</p>

  <p>And I'm sure those guiders are not strong enough to pose a threat to me,"</p>

  <p>Reynald said with a small smile.</p>

  <p>Now that the Sword Light Palace had been destroyed, the Stinger Guards had scattered. They were no threat to him. But most importantly, he had the support of the Black Armor race and the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers. Unless the Oneness Sky Palace sent its best warriors, he would be safe.</p>

  <p>Now, the members of the Black Armor race gathered around Reynald.</p>

  <p>Many of the over one thousand disciples had been killed by them, and only a hundred or so remained.</p>

  <p>When the umbrella-shaped enchanted barrier had appeared, they had all launched their attacks on it to destroy it.</p>

  <p>However, their strength was far inferior to Reynald's. They were powerless against it.</p>

  <p>Just like that, the two sides had confronted each other with the Latent Theurgy separating them.</p>

  <p>Inside the enchanted barrier, Ingram was busy healing his legs. After he had taken a pill, a mass of blood vitality wound itself around his broken legs, and his bones and muscles began to mend. "Reynald is right," he said solemnly. "The guiders sent by the Oneness Sky Palace usually aren't particularly powerful. They are quite mediocre. I'm afraid..."</p>

  <p>"The Latent Theurgy can't hold on for that long. Master Goran told me that it can only last for five days at best," Laura said, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Silence hung over them like a cloud. All they could do was rely on Laura.</p>

  <p>However, even she was at the end of her tether.</p>

  <p>"We can take a chance," Elgin said suddenly. "If we run into the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace in the Sea of Truth, we can ask them to report what happens here to their superiors!"</p>

  <p>"Good idea!" Beldene said, his eyes lighting up.</p>

  <p>Of all the disciples, only Beldene, Elgin and Zheng were allowed to enter the Sea of Truth. And they were very likely to meet disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace there.</p>

  <p>Ingram, however, was not convinced. "The probability is there, but it is too small. Even if you meet the Oneness Sky Palace disciples there, they won't believe you. Also, it takes a month to get to the Oneness Sky Palace by flying ship," he reasoned. "The only ones that can make it within five days are as powerful as the five-star Stinger Guards. And it is unlikely that a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace that is crossing the Sea of Truth will be able to persuade them."</p>

  <p>"They will never be able to convince the guards," Elgin said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I still think there is a chance that it will work. I am willing to try. After all, it is the only way!" exclaimed Beldene.</p>

  <p>Zheng said nothing. He was deep in thought.</p>

  <p>He remembered Dora mentioning a sky palace. Even though Dora hadn't told him where she was from, his intuition told him that she had a connection with the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>He could ask Dora for help, but if he did so, he would expose his identity.</p>

  <p>However, the only thing that would become known was that his body had entered the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, what are you thinking about?" asked Laura, interrupting his train of thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng had always been something of a mystery to her.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she had never asked him any specific questions concerning his past. As long as he didn't harm the Sword Light Palace, it was fine.</p>

  <p>Besides, he was not at a level high enough to do significant damage to the Sword Light Palace anyway.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible to get to the Oneness Sky Palace from the Seven-Star Province in five days?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Laura knew what Zheng meant. "Do you know anyone from the Oneness Sky Palace?" she said, narrowing her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Zheng replied ambiguously. After all, he was not certain about Dora's background.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the disciples lit up. Laura and Ingram also saw a glimmer of hope. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I made friends with her in the Sea of Truth," Zheng answered honestly.</p>

  <p>Skeptical, Elgin sneered. "It's just speculation, and that can't give anyone hope," he scoffed. "Don't listen to him," he added, rolling his eyes.</p>

  <p>Beldene, however, was optimistic as ever. "Even so, it is worth a try! Let's go to the Sea of Truth together!"</p>

  <p>Finding someone in the Sea of Truth was not an easy task. To find Dora, Zheng had to ensure that Dora entered at the same time as him and waited for him in the same area.</p>

  <p>This was not a problem for Zheng, of course.</p>
