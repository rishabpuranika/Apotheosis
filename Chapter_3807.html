<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The members of the Three Eyes race and the Swallow Victory race who stood nearby also saw Zheng's Three Purities Stone.</p>

  <p>Their facial expressions changed subtly as well.</p>

  <p>They thought that Zheng would amaze everyone with his outstanding performance in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and that was how things were supposed to go.</p>

  <p>To their great surprise, his performance was by no means outstanding.</p>

  <p>Instead, his journey in the Eternal Scroll Painting was fruitless until now.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Three Eyes race had a total of three members who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting this time. One of them was the three-eyed boy, Egan, who performed the best, while even the one who did the worst among the three of them  did much better than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Still, they didn't believe that the Grandmaster of Heaven would be wrong about his evaluation of Zheng. They thought that the reason behind Zheng's poor performance was probably because it was his first time to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>In any case, it wouldn't be a big deal if Zheng couldn't get to enter the Eternal Realm this time anyway.</p>

  <p>Most of these Other Shore creatures in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore had failed several times. Even the mighty warriors who were already at the Eternal Realm had also entered the Eternal Scroll Painting multiple times, and some of them a dozen or even a hundred times before.</p>

  <p>But because of Claire's and the Grandmaster of Heaven's perception of Zheng, everyone began to hold high expectations of him and believed that he would pass the Eternal Scroll Painting in one attempt. They had never imagined that he would've performed so clumsily.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng moved leisurely inside the painting.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know how the others fared, he knew that he had killed far too few beasts in more than two hours.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't his fault since only a few beasts had appeared around him.</p>

  <p>"Eh, that is..."</p>

  <p>Just then, he suddenly saw a dark thing rolling not far away. It wasn't until he got closer to it that he realized it was quite a big beast.</p>

  <p>He felt slightly happy to see the beast. It seemed that he wasn't that unlucky after all.</p>

  <p>The moment he quickly approached the beast, however, three Other Shore creatures from another direction rushed towards it.</p>

  <p>The three Other Shore creatures moved aggressively. Two of them pinned the beast down on both sides, while the other stabbed it.</p>

  <p>The dead beast turned into wisps of black smoke and quickly gathered around the Other Shore creature that killed it.</p>

  <p>It wasn't after they killed the beast that they noticed Zheng, who stood not far away.</p>

  <p>"Is that the human brat?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! He seems to have killed only a few beasts..."</p>

  <p>"I thought he was a big shot, but he isn't even qualified to enter the second page! He doesn't deserve any attention."</p>

  <p>Even though everyone turned into a flat picture, their voices were still transmitted in their original forms. Furthermore, the space allowed them to hear everything clearly.</p>

  <p>The more beasts they killed, the more black smoke wrapped around their bodies.</p>

  <p>Dense black smoke surrounded these three Other Shore creatures' bodies.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, only a small cloud of black smoke enveloped Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was hard for those Other Shore creatures not to envy him back then when both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race invited him at the same time, especially when he wasn't even an Other Shore creature. He came from the chaos, but he could freely enter and leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After they mocked him for a bit, they immediately left.</p>

  <p>Everyone was currently in a hurry to hunt the beasts, and no one wanted to waste their time.</p>

  <p>As soon as they left, Zheng helplessly rolled his eyes. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven could not help but sigh quietly at his supposedly bad luck.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that hard to pass through the first page of the Eternal Scroll Painting, and the beasts appeared at random positions. Even if someone was really unlucky, they should still be able to catch more than a few.</p>

  <p>Therefore, neither Zheng nor the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought that it was not because of bad luck that he hadn't encountered many beasts.</p>

  <p>Every time he moved towards an area with a beast, the beast would mysteriously disappear or move to another place.</p>

  <p>The same thing happened repeatedly for more than two hours.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast he traveled, most of the beasts had avoided him on time.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't see what happened from his point of view. He could only blame it on his bad luck.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a huge smiling face floated above the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>The face was also a picture, but it left the Eternal Scroll Painting and floated in a special space.</p>

  <p>"He seems to be a little impatient," the smiling face said softly.</p>

  <p>When the voice came through, however, the smiling face quickly turned into a crying face and the voice became rough.</p>

  <p>"Do we begin to guide him now?" the voice asked gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait a little longer. There are too many ants that have flocked into the scroll painting this time.</p>

  <p>I want to kill some of them," the soft voice came back as the face smiled.</p>

  <p>"Will they find out?" the crying face asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you think they don't know we exist? Those cunning men aren't capable enough, so they just want to make us help them. They're really dreaming," the smiling face snorted coldly.</p>

  <p>"Then let's do something about it right now!"</p>

  <p>At that point, the crying face stopped worrying anymore.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a big black hand that held a slender ink brush appeared in the special space.</p>

  <p>The hand gently drew on the Eternal Scroll Painting. Then a vivid beast came to life.</p>

  <p>This beast was much bigger than those that appeared before. Its face looked ferocious with its evil fangs, and sharp thorns covered its whole body. It wasn't like the beasts that couldn't defend themselves from the warriors.</p>

  <p>This beast was called the Worm Tapir. It was quite rare to find, even on the second page. Furthermore, the creatures on the Other Shore always tried their best to avoid it.</p>

  <p>There was once a time that an Other Shore race killed a Worm Tapir but at the price of nearly forty members' lives.</p>

  <p>As the slender ink brush continued to draw, more Worm Tapirs appeared on the scroll painting one by one.</p>

  <p>Not long after, more than a hundred Worm Tapirs filled the scroll painting.</p>

  <p>"Go and eliminate at least more than half of them," the crying face ordered.</p>

  <p>In turn, the newly created Worm Tapirs immediately scattered everywhere like spilled ink and looked for their prey.</p>

  <p>The competition among the Other Shore creatures on the first page was extremely fierce. Every time the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, only one-third of the creatures were allowed to enter the second page, so that every beast mattered.</p>

  <p>Four Other Shore creatures worked together and just killed a group of beasts in the upper left corner of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Just as they were about to hunt for more, a black shadow suddenly appeared nearby.</p>

  <p>They got excited as soon as they saw the black shadow and decided to capture it. However, one of them felt that something was wrong. A chill ran down his spine when he saw how the beast looked like.</p>

  <p>"That's a Worm Tapir! Run!"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creature who saw the beast had once been to the second page, where he saw a powerful Worm Tapir with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>He was confused, though. Why did a Worm Tapir appear on the first page?</p>

  <p>Of course, he had no time to know the answer.</p>

  <p>Once the Worm Tapir had targeted its prey, its body became erratic.</p>

  <p>Then, it appeared and disappeared from time to time.</p>

  <p>The Worm Tapir was also a picture, but unlike the Other Shore creatures who became pictures, it could leave the Eternal Scroll Painting for a short period.</p>

  <p>The second it jumped out of the Eternal Scroll Painting, it looked like it had disappeared when viewed from the painting.</p>

  <p>When the Worm Tapir fell back onto the Eternal Scroll Painting, it appeared again.</p>

  <p>While the scene played out repeatedly, the Worm Tapir tore the four Other Shore creatures into pieces. Black ink, which turned out to be those four Other Shore creatures' blood, gushed out from their mutilated limbs and flowed across the white painting.</p>
