<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two demon kings were able to prevent the Illuminating Soul Realm masters from passing. However, it was difficult to stop them from releasing their life vitality.</p>

  <p>Despite everything, the two demon kings did not comprehend why the person had suddenly conjured a Five-Clawed Golden Dragon. What was he plotting to do?</p>

  <p>The Five-Clawed Golden Dragon whirled in the sky, flying towards Zheng at a constant speed. When the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon soared to a certain distance, Zheng clenched his hands into fists and directly punched it.</p>

  <p>"Ogres Shaking the World!"</p>

  <p>A purple-black fist shadow came straight at the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon. "Boom!" The fist shadow penetrated into it, leaving a small black spot on the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon's body.</p>

  <p>Initially, it did not seem to reveal any other effect. Then, in the blink of an eye, the little black dot spread quickly like wildfire. Soon, the entire Five-Clawed Golden Dragon turned into a Five-Clawed Black Dragon!</p>

  <p>Zheng manipulated the Five-Clawed Black Dragon into spinning in the air while wandering around.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lennie who stood in the distance suddenly seemed to recall something as his eyes brightened.</p>

  <p>He waved his hand, and several silver swords flashed in it. As soon as the gleaming swords appeared, he launched them directly at Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>Imitating Lennie's move, Hugh also summoned another Five-Clawed Golden Dragon from his hand and shot it towards Zheng too.</p>

  <p>Whether it was a Five-Clawed Golden Dragon or gleaming swords, Zheng took on all of them without batting an eye. While still in his control, he made the Five-Clawed Black Dragon consume them.</p>

  <p>After the Five-Clawed Black Dragon devoured them completely, it expanded more than twice its initial size.</p>

  <p>At the sight of it, the Illuminating Soul Realm masters realized what had been on Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>All this time, the two men were releasing the life vitality and providing it to the Five-Clawed Black Dragon!</p>

  <p>Except for Spencer, whose life vitality was a huge incarnation, and was unable to be released, all the other people had taken out the life vitality from their bodies to shoot it towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Five-Clawed Black Dragon endlessly devoured the life vitality.</p>

  <p>Every time it did, its body became more massive, and its power grew mightier. After a period equivalent to the burning time of an incense stick, a gigantic Five-Clawed Black Dragon appeared in the sky!</p>

  <p>Spencer was shocked to witness the power of this Five-Clawed Black Dragon. Clenching his fists tightly, he thought, 'The life energy of this young man is so terrifying! Despite being half step into the nature level, he attained an immense momentum. His move offered such a surprise!</p>

  <p>It is so uncommon in the world!'</p>

  <p>After seeing the Five-Clawed Black Dragon, Hugh's jaw nearly dropped.</p>

  <p>Who was there that could deflect such a fatal blow from this beast? Even if it were Spencer countering an attack from the Five-Clawed Black Dragon, he would surely be scared out of his wits too.</p>

  <p>'No wonder I lost to Zheng. It is not a disgrace as he is so powerful after all,</p>

  <p>' Hugh thought.</p>

  <p>Lennie smiled and said in a low voice, "Huh! Despite merely reaching the half-step into the nature level, the man Nina favors is indeed not an ordinary person."</p>

  <p>Although dedicated to fighting back the evil spirits of Aldrich, when Yolande noticed the huge Five-Clawed Black Dragon, her eyes revealed shock while her grey pupils dilated. However, it only flashed for a second, and then she quickly regained her composure. It was a rare sight to see her taken aback by anything.</p>

  <p>Unless it was something incredible, the girl did not typically display any kind of emotional response.</p>

  <p>However, one thing was as clear as crystal, Zheng's method was incredible enough to succeed in capturing her eye.</p>

  <p>By taking advantage of the features of demonic life energy, and with the supply of the life vitality provided by the several Illuminating Soul Realm masters, he had produced such an intimidating and horrifying Five-Clawed Black Dragon. However, as colossal and majestic as it was, there was one fatal flaw!</p>

  <p>If it were in actual combat, none of the Illuminating Soul Realm masters or demon kings would feel frightened of this Five-Clawed Black Dragon.</p>

  <p>The reason was Zheng's power still paled in comparison to the strength of the masters. Moreover, he was only at the half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>As a result, the speed of the Five-Clawed Black Dragon he manipulated was far from being as swift as the demon kings and the Illuminating Soul Realm masters.</p>

  <p>No one was foolish enough to stand still and wait for the Five-Clawed Black Dragon to strike them.</p>

  <p>An opponent could easily run away and avoid the dragon. Then, as soon as the Five-Clawed Black Dragon disappeared, they could return and end Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, today's situation worked the best for this Five-Clawed Black Dragon to steal the show from everyone!</p>

  <p>Aldrich was now contending against Yolande with life vitality. It was hard for him to be distracted, let alone move.</p>

  <p>When he noticed the Five-Clawed Black Dragon though, his face had darkened. He could not imagine how Zheng, a human brat, was able to create such a terrific dragon.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the demon king became perplexed.</p>

  <p>Aldrich thought, 'Is it a trap right from the start or is it just a coincidence?</p>

  <p>If it is a trap, then they are engaging in some risky business. Did they really put all their hopes on a young human who only has half-step into the nature level? It is utterly impossible.</p>

  <p>But if it's a coincidence, is it God's way of saying that I will die today?'</p>

  <p>The demon king refused to accept such a cruel fate.</p>

  <p>It was apparent that beating the Illuminating Soul Realm humans was child's play. Yet, why had it suddenly turned out like this?</p>
