  <p>
</p>

  <p>The monkey chief was in fright, as if he'd just come close to a ghost.</p>

  <p>At this point, the monkey had no other choice. No one had asked him to keep a secret anyway.</p>

  <p>In order to survive, the monkey didn't hesitate for too long. "I can tell you.</p>

  <p>But you must let me go. Alive," he said.</p>

  <p>"I promise you." Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>"And how about... How about her?" the monkey asked, pointing at Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge saw this and nodded her head in approval, then the monkey let out a sigh before continuing to speak. "A few days ago, there were two human women passing here," he said very carefully. "But they were escorted by the Coldness Monkey Guards."</p>

  <p>"What is the Coldness Monkey Guard?" Zheng questioned.</p>

  <p>"They are the elites of our race and guard the Chief Flag Monkey," the monkey continued. "The Chief Flag Monkey is the commander in chief of the Royal Monkey race in Stage Fourteen. At first, I, too, was curious as to why they brought two human Souls of Light back..."</p>

  <p>The monkey went on to tell Zheng everything he knew. He even pointed out the location of the Coldness Monkey Guards after asking Zheng to take out a map from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Mercer," Zheng called out. He had everything he needed.</p>

  <p>Mercer, who was riding on a Holy Beetle, gradually flew to Zheng and cupped his hands towards him. "Kill him," Zheng ordered, pointing at the monkey.</p>

  <p>The monkey's eyes widened in shock. What just happened? "You...you promised me!" he screeched.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did." Zheng smiled. "But he didn't promise you." After his last word, he jumped down from the pass with Feng Ge following right behind him.</p>

  <p>Mercer, on the other hand, was stunned to have been given such an order.</p>

  <p>But because he was loyal to Zheng, he was going to do it either way.</p>

  <p>The Royal Monkey had no escape. No matter how powerful he was, he was trapped by the light awls fixed on his limbs. Just like that, he was at the disposal of Mercer.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a moment, Mercer reached into his pocket. From here, he took out several black bugs, which struck terror into the monkey immediately. He knew exactly what they were.</p>

  <p>These bugs were known as the blood devouring bugs. Just as their name implied, they would drill themselves into the host's body, multiply instantly, and suck every drop of blood.</p>

  <p>After the Splendid Jade Pass, the terrain around it gradually opened up.</p>

  <p>It allowed for better viewing, that even in the darkness, Zheng could spot the low houses from a distance. This was where the Royal Monkeys lived.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng raised up the javelin and gave a good look at the area. He then turned to his map as he tried to identify the place better. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. "The Coldness Monkey Guards mentioned by that monkey are here," he stated. "They are positioned over there!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked in the direction Zheng pointed out. "It's at the same direction of the Shape-shifting Spirit... How can we get in?"</p>

  <p>The main goal of their journey was to save Yan, and this should be done without disturbing the Royal Monkeys. To do so, they could not afford to make any mistakes. If the Royal Monkeys held Yan hostage to coerce Zheng, Zheng might yield to all their requirements.</p>

  <p>"I think we can use these," Mercer said, holding out the spy bugs in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and nodded at him in agreement.</p>

  <p>With a gentle toss, the bugs flew to the air and vanished into the darkness, heading to where the Royal Monkeys lived.</p>

  <p>Five minutes had passed and Mercer was finally able to gather information on the city. But just as he was about to report to Zheng, his face shifted.</p>

  <p>"No..." he trailed off.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng asked with much concern.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to say this...but the city is completely abandoned," Mercer said.</p>

  <p>"None of the monkeys are here!" He believed that his spy bugs would never deceive him.</p>

  <p>"How...how is that possible?" Zheng hissed, "Did you make a mistake?"</p>

  <p>"These spy bugs are always accurate. How could I be wrong?" Mercer answered affirmatively, looking ahead.</p>

  <p>Furrowing his eyebrows, Zheng looked at both Mercer and Feng Ge. "Well, let's go and take a look."</p>

  <p>As they entered the city, they finally confirmed that everything Mercer said was true. It was deserted, and no one could understand why.</p>

  <p>How could they have left so suddenly?</p>

  <p>"It seems that the stupid monkey from the Splendid Jade Pass had no idea about this..." Zheng said, frustrated.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge felt Zheng's despair and wanted to turn things around. "Let's find the Shape-shifting Spirit first."</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, they headed towards the north of the city and began their search using the soul mark. Not long after, they ended up stopping before a wide building.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt something about the building, so he pushed open the door to investigate.</p>

  <p>"Creak..."</p>

  <p>The moment the door swung open, whistling sounds travelled through the air.</p>

  <p>"Swish... Swish..."</p>

  <p>Just then, what seemed like thin, shiny needles began to shoot out from the walls of the building.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge raised her eyebrows, sensing the trap. All of a sudden, the light in her hand burst out!</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>When the needles were exposed to Feng Ge's light, they completely vanished. Moreover, when the light filled up the entire building, they heard screams - it was the Shape-shifting Spirit. "No, don't hurt me," it murmured.</p>

  <p>"It's me! The Shape-shifting Spirit!"</p>

  <p>Instead of stopping, Feng Ge radiated the light even more. It grew and grew, protecting both her and Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was not until the sound of the last needle snapping, that Feng Ge stopped.</p>

  <p>Finally, the two could clearly see what was going on in the building.</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit had already returned to its original form, hanging upside down from a rope.</p>

  <p>In a haste, Zheng suddenly threw the javelin and snapped the rope. "What just happened?" he asked the spirit. "Why were you hung there?"</p>

  <p>The spirit let out a sigh. "When I was sent to this city, I was detected..." It was very sullen with what it had just said.</p>

  <p>Though it was skilled in morphing itself, it could only be regarded as a pet.</p>

  <p>This was because it was not strong enough to go against anyone.</p>

  <p>Apparently, after getting beaten up by the Royal Monkeys, it was hung upside down and left behind there.</p>

  <p>"They didn't kill me though," the spirit pointed out. "I'm supposedly the bait that would lure you here."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, acknowledging this. After all, the needles were already an attempt to kill him. "But why are all the Royal Monkeys gone?"</p>

  <p>"The monkeys mentioned that they could not defeat you because you have a purified being," the spirit explained. "They also said that if you two are looking for the human woman's Soul of Light, you'd find them there." It gestured out, pointing towards a corner in the building.</p>

  <p>Across the wall was a poorly drawn map. The place they had to go to was clearly marked.</p>

  <p>Analyzing the map, Zheng let out a heavy sigh of relief. He then turned towards Feng Ge and smiled. "A few days ago, your light had eroded an area of the Dark Region," he said. "I think you've frightened these monkeys!</p>

  <p>They retreated without us even doing anything!" Zheng chuckled.</p>

  <p>This was true. In fact, Feng Ge could easily kill the entire Royal Monkey race in a rage. At least now, they had gone before she could do anything.</p>

  <p>"So what? They can't hide forever," said Feng Ge expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>"True. But one creature from the Dark Region is not afraid of the Great Sanskrit Light," Zheng added.</p>

  <p>Just then, everything clicked in Feng Ge's mind. Her face froze and her voice lowered. "Their goal is to lure us into facing the purified being of Stage Fourteen."</p>
