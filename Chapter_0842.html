<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On this wall, a countless amount of names were carved into the stone work.</p>

  <p>There were a total of nine rows.</p>

  <p>Presumably, the person or race that had built the Tower of Sin had divided creatures' talents into nine levels.</p>

  <p>People whose names were in the bottom row must have been the least talented of all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also noticed that when Yolande's name appeared, all the other names in the ninth row moved towards the right by one place, and the last name got squeezed out of the wall.</p>

  <p>Considering the amount of names that were there, this was understandable.</p>

  <p>Even though the wall was huge, it couldn't possibly record the name of every single person who had been tested.</p>

  <p>"This is normal. Anyone who's just entered and participated in the test is shown in the bottom row. However, that changes and the name climbs up gradually," Olivia explained.</p>

  <p>"Got it," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure what kind of test Yolande was facing right now. All they could see right now was the names on the wall and their ranks in the grid.</p>

  <p>Soon, Yolande's name disappeared from the ninth row and appeared in the eighth row. Once more, the last name in the eighth row disappeared just like the one in the ninth row had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Very soon after that, Yolande's name disappeared from the eighth row too and reappeared in the seventh.</p>

  <p>Hardly had they noticed her name there when it disappeared and reappeared in the sixth one this time.</p>

  <p>"So fast!" Olivia exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the tenth floor naturally paid close attention to the situation of the other races. When a person from any race entered the Talent Tablet, many creatures would come up and watch the tables turn. Some people even collected information and sent it to the top floor of the tower.</p>

  <p>Each race hoped that they could produce a strong and talented warrior, and at the same time, they also hoped that a talented person would not appear in some other race. This was the reason why they were watching the Talent Tablet so closely.</p>

  <p>Yolande's name was now in the sixth row. It meant that her talent was already on par with Olivia's. Olivia's name moved back one place because of that.</p>

  <p>The number of people who could get up into the sixth row was not small.</p>

  <p>Perhaps in a few years, even Olivia's name would get slowly squeezed out of the list.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande's name stopped in the sixth row only for a little while, after which, it jumped up to the fifth one.</p>

  <p>Many creatures' eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, the number of people whose names had jumped up to the fifth row was very limited. Aside from the ogres and the Demon Night, only the very top members of some races had been able to reach the fifth row.</p>

  <p>As for humans, aside from the mysterious Yolande, Olivia was the top talent of the Purple Heart Sacred Place and even she had only managed to reach the sixth row.</p>

  <p>Although everyone's eyes were wide open right now, they had already expected that this was going to happen. If Yolande's name had not reached the fifth row, every single contender from every single race would have lost his or her face. None of the creatures on the tenth floor had ever defeated Yolande.</p>

  <p>After that, Yolande's name stayed in the fifth row for a long while.</p>

  <p>A hint of disappointment appeared on everyone's face.</p>

  <p>"Yolande's talent is a bit lower than Boris'."</p>

  <p>"Still, you can't deny that her result is very impressive. At the very least, she's stronger than several divine-level talents of a number of races."</p>

  <p>"Hey guys! Hang on! I think Yolande's name just jumped up to the fourth row!"</p>

  <p>As everyone was discussing, Yolande's name suddenly burst out in a flash.</p>

  <p>It jumped again and was now in the fourth row, leaving behind the name "Boris."</p>

  <p>"The fourth row!"</p>

  <p>"Just as I expected."</p>

  <p>"Actually, it's not very surprising that she reached the fourth row. Yolande's talent is clearly better than that of Boris!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the sentence was finished, Yolande's name jumped up to the third row.</p>

  <p>"Whoa! She's in the third row now. She really is a monstrous level of talent.</p>

  <p>With her current talent, I think she's only second to the Demon Night's Amber."</p>

  <p>"Alas! If only Yolande had been, well, normal! With her talent, she might have been able to lead the human race to new heights of glory."</p>

  <p>"What's the use of saying that now? Although Yolande is willing to help humans, she does not belong to the human race. She belongs to the Tower of Sin."</p>

  <p>Amidst the discussions, Yolande's name disappeared once more and reappeared in the second row.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, everyone was shocked beyond words.</p>

  <p>Amber's name was now behind Yolande's.</p>

  <p>Who was Amber?</p>

  <p>Two hundred years ago, the ogres were even more prosperous than now.</p>

  <p>Although the rules dictated otherwise, the ogre war lords were so powerful that they occupied more than half of the seats. All the other races had been suppressed by them.</p>

  <p>The ogres would try all possible means to kill any upcoming talents from other races, even if it meant killing someone in public.</p>

  <p>Every time a super talent was born in some other race, he or she was wiped out by the ogres very soon after entering the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The other races did not dare to say anything.</p>

  <p>After all the other races had joined forces to fight against the ogres, the ogres then agreed to give up a portion of the seats, allowing many other races to train inside the tower. This was considered a great concession on the ogres' part in those days.</p>

  <p>It was the appearance of Amber that ended this injustice and completely suppressed the ogres.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter if the ogres sent assassins after Amber, or if they tried openly killing her; their efforts were of no avail. She became a rapidly rising star, and as she climbed up the floors, her strength also began to increase rapidly.</p>

  <p>When the ogres came back to their senses, they actually had to send out war lords to assassinate Amber.</p>

  <p>But at that time, even the war lords were unable to kill Amber.</p>

  <p>In the end, Amber managed to enter the top floor of the Tower of Sin. She obtained a seat when she reached there, and at the same time, exterminated twelve ogre war lords. With her own strength, and without any external help, she snatched twelve seats from the hands of the ogres.</p>

  <p>Amber's appearance had ended the ogres' monopoly over the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Finally, when Amber walked out of the Tower of Sin, she rewrote the entire structure of the Sea God continent. After a hundred years, when she reached the Soul Sea Realm, the strength of the Demon Night's sacred place had already surpassed the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place. It would have required the combined strength of two ogres' sacred places to deal with the Demon Night's single sacred place.</p>

  <p>By now, Amber had already become a legendary figure of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Even the Ancient Tycoons were too afraid to offend Amber.</p>

  <p>Seeing Yolande's test result, many humans couldn't help but sigh.</p>

  <p>If Yolande was willing to help the human race, perhaps their position on the continent would get enhanced a lot. They didn't expect her to bring the human race to levels as high as the Demon Night since every single member of the Demon Night was very powerful. The ogres had managed to win over the other races only because they had taken the first step and played dirty.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande could at least guarantee that the humans would get out of their present situation and not be bullied anymore.</p>

  <p>Just when everyone thought that Yolande's name was going to be fixed in the second row, it suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>"What?!" Some of the onlookers actually pinched their chests to check that they weren't dreaming this whole thing!</p>

  <p>"Who exactly is Yolande? How is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>"She's actually on par with those characters."</p>

  <p>"These five people have always been legendary figures and anyone better than them has never existed on our Sea God Continent. But Yolande..."</p>

  <p>The five names in the first row were familiar to everyone in the Tower of Sin. After all, they were the most talented and well known figures, so how could anyone forget them?</p>

  <p>As for the speculations about these five creatures, everyone had his or her own opinion regarding them.</p>

  <p>Actually, it was similar to what Luo Zheng had in mind.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the amazing Tower of Sin was not supposed to belong to the Lower World. The five creatures in the first row were probably some great powers in the Upper World. Their talents were likely far beyond the imagination of the creatures of the Sea God Continent, and could only be described as legendary.</p>

  <p>No one had ever thought that there was going to be a legend by their side.</p>

  <p>But in any case, Yolande was able to make it into the first row and stand by the five names. No one on the Sea God Continent had ever done this before.</p>

  <p>Amber had not done it, nor had the other talented people.</p>

  <p>Once Yolande's name stabilized, the light on the wall faded away. Then the door slowly opened, and her nine-colored long skirt swayed as she slowly walked out.</p>

  <p>She expressionlessly turned her head and glanced at her name. There was no trace of any expression on her face; no joy or happiness, and no excitement either. It was as if everything that had happened was completely according to her expectations.</p>

  <p>She walked over to Luo Zheng and asked coldly, "Is it your turn?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and walked towards the door without a pause.</p>

  <p>Olivia, who was standing behind him, cheered and encouraged him. "Good luck, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and nodded his head. Then, he too plunged into the darkness. The surrounding lights suddenly dimmed, and the wall once again started to emit an endless luster.</p>
