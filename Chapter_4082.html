<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4082 Conditions </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you!"</p>

  <p>"Me, too!"</p>

  <p>"Manuel, please take me with you!"</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters were speaking over each other now, scrambling for the chance to accompany Manuel.</p>

  <p>Manuel was the leader of the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>Manuel's eyes scanned the throng quickly. "Tearrag, Hagar, and Nereus.</p>

  <p>The three of you, come with me!"</p>

  <p>Now that some people had brought wolf teeth here to the Ghost Mountain, there was no need to worry about any of them escaping.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters were all indispensable core members of the Monkey Spirit Sect. Even if they became Treacherous Beings, they would be extremely powerful after they were awakened.</p>

  <p>As the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest led the way back to the Ghost Altar, he felt dread creep into his heart.</p>

  <p>He was a Great Ghost Priest on the side of the human race.</p>

  <p>He had been worried on his way to deliver the wolf tooth.</p>

  <p>If the wolf tooth was real, it wouldn't be good for the humans at the Ghost Altar right now.</p>

  <p>Now that that was the case, those humans were definitely in danger.</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest and the four Monkey Masters arrived at the space channel shortly. With a small bow, the Great Ghost Priest gestured respectfully for the Monkey Masters to go through first. "After you."</p>

  <p>Manuel swaggered into the space channel.</p>

  <p>In an instant, he reappeared at an entrance above the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>"A Treacherous Being?"</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others looked up and stared at Manuel as he stepped into view.</p>

  <p>Manuel wasn't actively emanating any aura.</p>

  <p>But his mere presence inspired awe.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't experienced this feeling for a long time, not even with the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Was this Treacherous Being a hatred-level one? How powerful was he?</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Master Manuel!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke up, respectfully.</p>

  <p>Although the Ghost Mountain belonged to the Ghost Master, he hadn't awoken yet.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Mountain was under the control of these Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>Among them, Manuel enjoyed the highest status. He was thus, at that moment, the de facto controller of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Manuel nodded to the Primeval Lord of Heaven in acknowledgement.</p>

  <p>He ignored the other Great Ghost Priests completely.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests were powerful and majestic beings in the eyes of Bacchus and the other warriors from many races.</p>

  <p>But in the eyes of the Monkey Masters, they were merely a group of slaves.</p>

  <p>As far as the Monkey Masters were concerned, the Great Ghost Priests were nothing but prisoners tasked to serve the Ghost Mountain for generations.</p>

  <p>After the Night View Island was sealed, these slaves were barred from going out. Otherwise, they would go out to search for wolf teeth on behalf of the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was probably the only one with a high status among them, and the only one whom Manuel respected. Manuel even relied on him to help awaken the Ghost Master.</p>

  <p>Manuel's nod of acknowledgement was thus a great privilege the other Great Ghost Priests would never be able to get.</p>

  <p>"Who brought the wolf tooth here?" Manuel asked imperiously.</p>

  <p>"Me," answered the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>"How many wolf teeth do you still have?" Manuel continued.</p>

  <p>"Nine," the Eye Spirit replied.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the four Monkey Masters flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>All those present knew instantly what that meant.</p>

  <p>"Hand them over," Manuel ordered.</p>

  <p>Although the Element Spirit Civilization was unusual in form, Manuel remained unperturbed.</p>

  <p>He had seen many things: the world formed by pure fire spirits, the world formed by water spirits, and many others.</p>

  <p>"No," the Eye Spirit replied casually.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Altar suddenly became deathly silent.</p>

  <p>Everyone held their breath.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Zheng, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, even the warriors from other races like Bacchus, Tate and some others, had encountered Manuel. But they all felt his domineering power upon his arrival.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit actually dared to openly refuse such a being. Didn't he realize what he was up against?</p>

  <p>Manuel was taken aback at the brazen response. His face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Are you not afraid of me? Do you have any idea who I am?"</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit responded calmly. "You are the top Great Ape King in the Monkey Spirit Sect, in possession of extraordinary strength. Of course I'm in awe of you. But I entered the Ghost Mountain prepared to die, so I'm afraid threatening me with that just wouldn't work."</p>

  <p>Great Ape King was a laudatory title in the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>This title was known only to the Four Spirits Sect. In the Ghost Mountain, only the Monkey Masters knew about it.</p>

  <p>Even the Great Ghost Priests, including the Primeval Lord of Heaven, had no idea what it was.</p>

  <p>But the Eye Spirit just openly revealed Manuel's past identity. It was clear he wanted Manuel to know that the Element Spirit Civilization was being backed by a powerhouse as strong and established as the Monkey Spirit Sect, which was the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests trembled.</p>

  <p>Any minute now, they were expecting Manuel to fly into a rage at the Eye Spirit's behavior.</p>

  <p>There would be tragedy and destruction in the wake of his fury. The Great Ghost Priests were terrified of being caught in that storm.</p>

  <p>But what Manuel did next shocked them.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, then? What are your conditions?"</p>

  <p>Manuel was actually negotiating with someone!</p>

  <p>And with a warrior from another race out of nowhere, no less!</p>

  <p>They almost couldn't believe their ears.</p>

  <p>"First, hand over all the humans to me. Second, let me wake up the Monkey Spirit King," the Eye Spirit said flatly.</p>

  <p>In fact, the first condition was supplementary.</p>

  <p>What the Eye Spirit really cared about was the second condition: the important task he came here to do.</p>

  <p>A look of hesitation crossed Manuel's face, perhaps for the first time in history.</p>

  <p>He wasn't hesitating because of the first condition. It was actually no problem to him.</p>

  <p>In fact, as soon as he confirmed the veracity of the wolf tooth, he was already prepared to send the Primeval Lord of Heaven to his doom.</p>

  <p>He had waited so long for this chance to wake up the Ghost Master, and it turned out he still had to rely on the real wolf teeth to achieve it.</p>

  <p>These humans were meaningless to the Ghost Mountain, anyway. The Eye Spirit could have them, for all he cared.</p>

  <p>He was, of course, hesitating on the second condition.</p>

  <p>It had always been the Monkey Masters' sworn duty to awaken the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Manuel was the one that the Monkey Spirit King trusted the most and his long-cherished wish was to wake up the Monkey Spirit King himself.</p>

  <p>As Manuel remained silent, the Eye Spirit continued. "Great Ape King, it's our common goal to awaken the Monkey Spirit King. As long as he wakes up, everything will work out fine, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>Manuel nodded. "Yes. You are correct."</p>

  <p>This meant that Manuel had accepted the Eye Spirit's two conditions.</p>

  <p>"So the lives of these people are at our disposal now?" Claire said, sneering menacingly.</p>

  <p>The humans in the Ghost Mountain right now were facing imminent doom.</p>

  <p>Even if they had four Great Ghost Priests on their side, they stood no chance.</p>

  <p>Before Manuel could answer, the Primeval Lord of Heaven piped up.</p>

  <p>"Master Manuel, the necklace of wolf teeth may not necessarily be the Ghost Master's obsession. Perhaps you should decide on this after the Ghost Master awakens."</p>

  <p>Manuel paused to think it over.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Please wake up the Ghost Master first. Then you could do whatever you like with these humans," he told the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he could still use the Primeval Lord of Heaven, after all.</p>

  <p>If the Thirteen Teeth Necklace failed to work, at least the Primeval Lord of Heaven would still be there to help figure things out.</p>

  <p>If Manuel sent him to his death now, there was no undoing that.</p>

  <p>"Great Ape King..."</p>

  <p>Before Claire could argue, the Eye Spirit broke in, "That's fine with us.</p>

  <p>Very well, then. Let's do as you suggest."</p>
