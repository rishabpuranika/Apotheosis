<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was pulled away, the Monkey Spirit King's body would instantly regain its freedom.</p>

  <p>However, he was still in an unconscious state. His dream was firmly restricting his awakening.</p>

  <p>Now that the wolf teeth left his body, his control over himself was also greatly weakened.</p>

  <p>Because of this, his huge body was constantly moving and attacking the surrounding area.</p>

  <p>He was madly releasing his power. That was why no one could just freely approach him.</p>

  <p>He would roll, then dash here and there, and sometimes throw massive punches.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Sewell still attempted to retrieve the wolf teeth that had fallen into the lake.</p>

  <p>After all the efforts that he poured to make his plan work, he was not willing to fail just like this.</p>

  <p>However, he also knew how dangerous it was to approach the lake because of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>With just his subconsciousness, he would attack any creature around him without exception.</p>

  <p>Sewell and the Eye Spirit had attempted several times to get in the lake, but they failed miserably. The unconscious body of the Monkey Spirit King didn't give them any chance.</p>

  <p>Finally, realizing that the mission had completely failed, Sewell gritted his teeth and ordered, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>He turned into a huge white shadow and drilled into the middle of the lake.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit, Claire, and Gavyn quickly followed into the lake.</p>

  <p>As they dove into the middle of the lake, several Monkey Masters followed them behind.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters actually didn't want to hunt Sewell down.</p>

  <p>They were more worried about the Monkey Spirit King. Moreover, because of the great changes that already happened to him, they had to keep watch all the more. Besides, even if they killed Sewell, he would just revive afterward.</p>

  <p>Right now, their goal was to just expel Sewell and his companions and prevent them from destroying the passageway.</p>

  <p>The passageway of the Night View Island was finally repaired after a long time. They wanted to do everything they could to prevent it from getting destroyed again.</p>

  <p>However, in the desperate situation just now, they had considered to voluntarily destroy the passageway, if it was the only way to ensure the safety of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>They prepared themselves for this last resort if they had no other choice left.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King continued to struggle furiously.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he was releasing a tremendous power in the middle of the lake.</p>

  <p>Not even the Monkey Masters dared to approach him.</p>

  <p>The power of the Monkey Spirit King was almost inexhaustible. No one exactly knew how long would this situation ensue.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his group just hovered over the lake and waited patiently and silently.</p>

  <p>Then, three Monkey Masters flew over to them.</p>

  <p>They were Tearrag, Hagar, and Nereus.</p>

  <p>In the Monkey Spirit Sect, they were just a rank below Manuel.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked respectfully.</p>

  <p>He stepped forward and bowed as soon as he saw the Monkey Masters approach them.</p>

  <p>Tearrag glanced at Fuxi and said, "We want to thank you for helping our king."</p>

  <p>"You could've just escaped during the fight just now. Why did you bother to take such a big risk just to save our king?" Hagar asked with a straight face.</p>

  <p>These Monkey Masters had a clear sense of mind. For Luo Zheng and the others to take that kind of risk, they must have some ulterior motive.</p>

  <p>Although these humans had been staying in the Ghost Mountain for countless years, they belonged to a different world and didn't really have a harmonious relationship with them.</p>

  <p>So, right now, they just wanted to set things straight.</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean. And yes, it's because we have something to ask from the Monkey Spirit King, or technically, from the entire Monkey Spirit Sect," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with honesty.</p>

  <p>"The entire sect? Does that mean you want us to support you?" Nereus asked.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a faint smile due to their straightforwardness.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied frankly.</p>

  <p>"Well, we have no say in this matter," Tearrag said as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Actually, even Manuel can't make the decision," Hagar added.</p>

  <p>"We understand that only the Ghost Master can make the decision," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you understand. If he doesn't wake up, we can't do anything about your request," Nereus remarked.</p>

  <p>"Then, what if I wake him up?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly asked. The eyes of the three Monkey Masters instantly lit up as they heard his words.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other and nodded afterward.</p>

  <p>They had known the Primeval Lord of Heaven for a long while.</p>

  <p>He had established his reputation, and they knew that he wouldn't say such words without being sure that he could fulfill it.</p>

  <p>Hearing it from him, the Monkey Masters had begun to see a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>"You can really do that?" Tearrag asked just to make sure. "There is a way," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.</p>

  <p>"That's good to hear then," Tearrag answered.</p>

  <p>"If you can wake our king up, we will definitely put in a good word for you," he added.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters were unable to make a decision themselves, but the Monkey Spirit King had the utmost trust in his subordinates, so he would absolutely consider their advice.</p>

  <p>For the Primeval Lord of Heaven, that was already enough. He just wanted to make sure that the Monkey Masters would keep their end of the bargain.</p>

  <p>"Now, I want you to collect all of the wolf teeth," the Primeval Lord of Heaven instructed.</p>

  <p>"Sure. And then?" Hagar asked. This was an important mission to them, so he wanted to hear the full details of the plan.</p>

  <p>If possible, the Monkey Masters wanted to know what the Primeval Lord of Heaven would exactly do to wake the Monkey Spirit King up.</p>

  <p>"After that, you can leave the rest to us," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a cautious expression.</p>

  <p>The secret of the ancestry-level bloodline should be kept as a top secret.</p>

  <p>So, he couldn't just tell it even to the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters understood what the Primeval Lord of Heaven meant, so they didn't pry further. What was more important was to save their king.</p>

  <p>With that, they quickly dove into the water and began looking for the wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>The wolf teeth had actually become very large, so it wouldn't be that difficult to find them.</p>

  <p>With the Monkey Spirit King eventually moving towards the northern part of the Night View Island, they soon found all of the thirteen wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>As they waited patiently, the Monkey Spirit King's madness lasted longer than everyone had imagined.</p>

  <p>In total, it lasted for ten whole days.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he had stayed in the water. Thus only the northern part of the annular mountain range was damaged severely.</p>

  <p>After ten days, the Monkey Spirit King eventually calmed down.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters couldn't figure out a way to move his huge body, so they just let him stay and sit in the lake.</p>

  <p>During the past ten days when the Monkey Spirit King had wreaked havoc in the Night View Island, many inhabitants were greatly affected.</p>

  <p>After the Ghost Mountain was broken, a lot of hostility-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings tried fleeing from the place, but they were all caught and taken back by the Monkey Masters and the Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>The members of the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race, and the Grand Mighty race who had been waiting at the Ghost Altar also secretly went back to their territories.</p>

  <p>When they observed the vicious fight between the Monkey Masters and Sewell, they secretly guessed what had happened.</p>

  <p>During the past ten days, Tate and Murdock grew anxious for each passing day.</p>

  <p>They knew that if they remained there, there was a huge possibility that they would die.</p>

  <p>However, the passageway to the island was tightly guarded by the Monkey Masters, and thus escaping was very impossible for them.</p>

  <p>In short, for the past few days, they accepted that they could just wait quietly for their impending death.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the atmosphere in the Glede Demon race was much more relaxed.</p>

  <p>Although the Night View Island had undergone exceptional changes and all creatures would also probably face unforeseen changes in the future, the Glede Demon race had an advantage because they had chosen to follow the humans.</p>

  <p>At that time, Decker was originally guarded by Bainbridge.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the Ghost Mountain collapsed, Bainbridge fled and left him alone. Seeing that he was freed, he left the mountain and returned to the Wooden Leaf race.</p>

  <p>This time, he entered the Ghost Mountain to try his luck. He thought that perhaps, he could fuse with a powerful hostility-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Though there might be resentment-level ones there, he didn't dare to think of fusing with them.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, he had got a hatred-level Treacherous Being named Cary.</p>

  <p>Cary was still in his glazed sheet now.</p>

  <p>Decker didn't try to fuse with him, but he still mustered his courage to communicate with him through his consciousness.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Cary turned out to be a friendly-type Treacherous Being, so he didn't repel Decker.</p>

  <p>After a few days of constant communication, they got along better.</p>

  <p>This made Decker totally excited.</p>

  <p>He was thinking what the patriarch would say and react once he saw him with Cary.</p>

  <p>Even if Decker didn't fuse with the Treacherous Being, he would still have unparalleled combat power.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, he went home briskly.</p>

  <p>However, as he returned to the territory of the Wooden Leaf race, his eyes widened as he clenched his fists. He saw that a group of warriors from the Evil Tiger race were besieging the hillside where the Wooden Leaf race peacefully dwelled.</p>
