<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The height of nine hundred and forty feet had already exceeded Yan's height for twenty feet.</p>

  <p>Even as Yan attempted another round, she couldn't go beyond this. Duke was thinking that the height was safe for now.</p>

  <p>However, he had no idea that Luo Zheng would rush up in such a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>"Alright then!"</p>

  <p>Duke stretched out his hand and scratched, leaving a "Duke" on the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Then he lifted his body into the air and shouted, "Do it! Now!"</p>

  <p>His hands morphed into claws and then he rushed towards Luo Zheng from above him.</p>

  <p>He would make sure to put a stop to Luo Zheng no matter what.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the cyan stone tablet, disciples of the wealthy clans and the Sword Clan were found to be at a stalemate. They sat quietly, watching Duke and Luo Zheng closely.</p>

  <p>Just then, Duke announced that everyone could take action as well.</p>

  <p>Among the members of the alliance of the wealthy clans, except the seven men with the Phoenix-head Golden Needles in their bodies, the rest of the True Gods took action.</p>

  <p>"You, get out of here!"</p>

  <p>A sinister smile plastered across Duke's face, and a destructive energy began to erupt from him.</p>

  <p>"Destructive Godly Way!</p>

  <p>Sinking star in the ocean!"</p>

  <p>Before climbing up the cyan stone tablet, Duke had so many ideas and plans running through his mind.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng wasn't strong enough, Duke thought it best to ignore him.</p>

  <p>However, if this guy's height slightly threatened him, he would definitely make a move.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng and Duke were both suppressed by the Truth of Godly Way, Duke had already carved his name which gave him a noticeable advantage.</p>

  <p>He would win in any way.</p>

  <p>"Brother! Damn!"</p>

  <p>Yan grew nervous at the sight of his brother in war with someone so powerful.</p>

  <p>Reinhard had led Sword Clan's disciples to form the sword array, ready to fight against the True Gods from the wealthy clans, but Yan was not in the mood to fight.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Duke seemed to transform himself into a star and directly launched himself at Luo Zheng. He smirked, giving off a face full of pride.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng was under such a strong pressure, and he had no way to dodge, he was having a hard time resisting the attack in any way.</p>

  <p>Everything was going well for Duke.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was still wearing an indifferent face, and his clear eyes were filled with some sort of calmness despite the situation.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's calm expression, Duke's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>And even from that calmness, there was a faint trace of contempt for Duke.</p>

  <p>He shouldn't have been so calm.</p>

  <p>'Did I miss something?</p>

  <p>Impossible!'</p>

  <p>However, when Duke approached Luo Zheng, he smiled back and waved his right hand at the same time.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, a small black snake emerged from the palm of his right hand.</p>

  <p>Duke was stunned to see the creature slither up.</p>

  <p>"The jade seal!"</p>

  <p>Duke hadn't been invited to the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, he wasn't even on the Floating Island to begin with, so naturally he was not invited.</p>

  <p>However, before he came to the debate venue, he had heard about the jade seal, and couldn't believe that this supreme treasure of belief actually fell into Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>He also noticed that along the way, he had never seen Luo Zheng use it. He almost forgot it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The next moment, Duke bumped into Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'I hit him?'</p>

  <p>Duke was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>Right there and then, Luo Zheng didn't resist at all and was knocked down by him.</p>

  <p>However, the impact only lasted around three seconds.</p>

  <p>Right after, the whole scene disappeared!</p>

  <p>Just like that, Duke descended from nine hundred and forty feet down to eight hundred and fifty feet.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he managed to reach around nine hundred feet instead.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Duke turned over and tried to extract his strength, rushing up there again.</p>

  <p>Originally, he aimed to rush downwards with his accelerated speed.</p>

  <p>Now, under the pressure of the debate venue, it was extremely difficult for him to forcefully turn his body.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Duke activated the Dragon-head Silver Needle across his chest.</p>

  <p>The whirlpool in his body ended up devouring the cultivation of the other seven people very intensely.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>At the foot of the cyan stone tablet, the seven top-rank True Gods sitting on the ground looked ghastly pale, spitting out blood from their mouths.</p>

  <p>"Duke! You..."</p>

  <p>Tyrone gritted his teeth, and fell down to the ground.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods did exactly the same.</p>

  <p>They couldn't stand the fierce extracting - it was too much for them.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Duke managed to reach eight hundred and forty feet and stopped in the air.</p>

  <p>But this only lasted for a short amount of time. Tyrone and the others fainted, so without the help of the Energy-extracting Needles, he had no way to maintain the height.</p>

  <p>Just then, Duke looked up at Luo Zheng, his eyes filled with despair, and fell involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"What did he do?" asked Yan, with a face full of surprise and concern.</p>

  <p>She couldn't believe that she just saw Duke hit her brother.</p>

  <p>However, her brother abruptly passed by Duke. Yan could not understand this strange and bizarre scene.</p>

  <p>"Soaring Sky Sword Array!"</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>As everyone already knew, the Soaring Sky Sword Array was something very powerful and respected. This time, it just blocked the attack from the True Gods of the wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>"Well, since that's the case." With a sudden flash of purple light in her eyes, Yan joined the fight.</p>

  <p>Harold, Marsh and Gibson were all holding their breath as they saw Luo Zheng's confrontation with Duke.</p>

  <p>It had been years since they had ever been so worried of the outcome of a fight.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect for this to be so intense and hectic.</p>

  <p>But eventually, their expressions lightened and they found themselves cheering.</p>

  <p>"Bravo!" Marsh praised.</p>

  <p>"Right! The jade seal is in Luo Zheng's hand! I think I'm too old to remember this, hahaha..." Gibson roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>With a deep sigh, Harold added, "Let's see how Luo Zheng can defend himself from Duke!"</p>

  <p>"Nine hundred and ten feet!"</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng had made great efforts to advance over his opponent.</p>

  <p>He just needed to surpass Duke, even if by an inch if he could.</p>

  <p>However, at this time, the crisp sound of "click" came from the flying sword under his feet again.</p>

  <p>"It's finally going to break," he whispered to himself.</p>

  <p>The flying sword seemed to be covered with cracks so it was most likely to be broken into pieces anytime soon.</p>

  <p>"Strength source..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had to let go of all of his fortune for a single throw.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Just like that, the strength source exploded and it slammed on the flying sword.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng began to spurt upwards.</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and forty feet...</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and fifty feet...</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and sixty feet...</p>

  <p>"Now, it is the time!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze froze as an invisible flying sword materialized before his very eyes.</p>

  <p>The flying sword moved on the cyan stone tablet, and a huge "Luo Zheng" was finally engraved on it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng's body floated and he fell down.</p>

  <p>Duke's heart broke at the sight of Luo Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>As soon as their eyes met, Duke's face flashed with a certain fierceness and anger.</p>

  <p>In the end, this was the result of Duke's little trick. There was only one thought left in his heart: to kill this guy at any cost.</p>
