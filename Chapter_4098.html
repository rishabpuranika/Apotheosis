</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what the Monkey Spirit King said, Zheng became a bit confused.</p>

  <p>He furrowed his brows in confusion. "I thought the Four Spirits Sect was invincible in the main world. If it were, why did you hide in the chaos?"</p>

  <p>According to the Monkey Spirit King's words, Zheng suspected that there might have been some sort of crisis in the main world.</p>

  <p>Before the said crisis came, the Monkey Spirit King realized he and his subordinates couldn't survive it. This left him with no choice. He had to retreat with the Monkey Spirit Sect into another world until it was safe for them to come back.</p>

  <p>They did all they could before they went into hiding. One of the projects they did before leaving was the Ghost Mountain, which they built to thrust out all sorts of creatures from the main world.</p>

  <p>But who or what was threatening enough to cause the Four Spirits Sect to act in this manner? Who or what held that much power?</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King let out a loud huff, almost as if he did not want to answer Zheng's question. "A disaster," he said, deciding to reveal the truth.</p>

  <p>"A great disaster happened."</p>

  <p>"What disaster?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Under his breath, the Monkey Spirit King replied to him with something in Sanskrit, his voice fluctuating in a rhythmic pattern.</p>

  <p>"It is..." the Monkey Spirit King paused, trying to find the accurate words to fit his description. "It is a type of calamity. At least that is how we refer to it in the main world. I do not know how to explain what it is in your language," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Hmm," Zheng said, lowering his head in careful thought. For a short while, he seemed to be meditating, and then he slowly raised his head to address the Monkey Spirit King. "The Sanskrit words you said mean the Space and Time Calamity, right? A calamity that crosses space and time?'' he said.</p>

  <p>When the Monkey Spirit King heard this, he snapped his head towards Zheng's direction, looking at him with a confused yet curious expression.</p>

  <p>In his position as a leader of the Four Spirits Sect, he had had several odd encounters. Because of this, it was very difficult to surprise him, but Zheng managed to do so twice in a row.</p>

  <p>Without the aid of the Four Spirits Sect, he knew people from the secondary worlds like Zheng were not literate in Sanskrit, but somehow, he was able to understand him.</p>

  <p>"Young man," the Monkey Spirit King said, "you are a creature from the chaos, aren't you?" Zheng nodded his head in response. "How then are you able to understand Sanskrit?" The Monkey Spirit King followed up.</p>

  <p>"Well, '' Zheng replied, ''for starters, I do not understand Sanskrit, at least not with my own abilities. It is being translated to me in the language I speak.''</p>

  <p>Shortly after he said this, he bowed his head again, meditating. He called onto the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, kindly requesting it to decipher the rest of the Monkey Spirit King's words.</p>

  <p>This piqued the curiosity of the Monkey Spirit King. "How exactly is it being translated to you?" he asked, interest evident in his tone.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled softly. "Well," he began.</p>

  <p>He did not expect the Monkey Spirit King to ask about his mental translation process, what more be interested in it.</p>

  <p>Despite this, he began to explain to the Monkey Spirit King how it worked, going into as much detail as possible to avoid any cause of confusion.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished, the Monkey Spirit King flashed him a big grin.</p>

  <p>For the first time, he found out that the secondary world had its share of intelligence, and that it had its method of calculation and translation. He made a mental note that if he had an opportunity, he would go to the chaos to experience it for himself.</p>

  <p>Putting these thoughts aside, the Monkey Spirit King readied himself to discuss the subject in depth. He took a large breath then began to speak,</p>

  <p>"Although citizens from this secondary world refer to it as the Space and Time Calamity, this 'Space and Time' is far different from the one you are acquainted with. Space and time in the secondary world are completely different from the ones in the main world. Those who do not inhabit the latter are unable to fully grasp its scope; therefore, they are unable to understand the severity of the disaster. This is why I brought the Monkey Spirit Sect to Ghost Mountain. We needed to avoid the damage it was to bring."</p>

  <p>Zheng stayed silent, egging the Monkey Spirit King to go on.</p>

  <p>Even though this was all happening within the Monkey Spirit Sect, he knew human spirits were also involved, which meant he had to pay attention very closely.</p>

  <p>Adding to this was the fact he, out of everyone, had obtained the ancestry-level bloodline. To him, this meant that he was important in the grand scheme of it all, and that not only the chaos was involved.</p>

  <p>He continued to listen attentively.</p>

  <p>"The Space and Time Calamity has been wreaking its havoc upon the main world for a long time," the Monkey Spirit King said. He turned his eyes upon the "starry sky" and continued, "The space and time in the chaos are linear— from near to distant, from past to future. But in the main world, they are completely different..."</p>

  <p>Zheng knew what the Monkey Spirit King was talking about.</p>

  <p>He experienced the complexity of space and time himself when he entered the Abstruse Energy World for the first time.</p>

  <p>Similar to what the Monkey Spirit King mentioned, he was not able to determine how far he had been pacing or how long he had been staying within its domains.</p>

  <p>Space and time in the Abstruse Energy World were far different from the ones he had familiarized himself with.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King went on, "Most of the time, the sequence of space and time in the main world follows a rule; however, now and then, glitches will happen, eventually leading to disasters." He paused, trying to compose himself. "Those disasters are very strong, strong enough to devour anything that crosses their paths. Unfortunately, many members of the Four Spirits Sect were devoured. But the coverage of the disasters is actually very small."</p>
