  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the long-haired woman left, the skeleton returned to his original, motionless state.</p>

  <p>He gripped his long sword in his hand and went back to staring at the scene on the well wall with empty eyes.</p>

  <p>"They haven't given up. They really are a persistent family." The skeleton let out a long, final sigh. "Although there's only a very slight chance, I'd actually like to see them succeed. I'll grant them with this opportunity..."</p>

  <p>The debate venue and the entire Non-combat Zone were completely under the skeleton's control.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had inferred that something was wrong in the debate venue, he still had high hopes that he'd figure the mystery out.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't know that the mystery was controlled by the skeleton!</p>

  <p>The skeleton could give his heritage to anyone, as long as such was as he desired.</p>

  <p>That said though, if he didn't agree, then no one could pass through the debate venue.</p>

  <p>The mist was heavy and white.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, with both his feet on the flying sword, rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Reinhard followed right behind him, anxiously.</p>

  <p>This situation was now completely out of his control. He no longer had any idea what to do.</p>

  <p>According to Reinhard's initial plan, he was supposed to be the one escorting Luo Zheng and his sister through the debate venue.</p>

  <p>After seeing Luo Zheng's avatar, Reinhard was very hopeful about the debate over the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that the incarnations of fears he encountered in the debate venue this time would be the most powerful ones he'd ever seen.</p>

  <p>What would they encounter under Luo Zheng's lead?</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p id="top_8">A roar rang out loudly from the mist.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a huge shadow was rushing out toward them as fast it possibly could.</p>

  <p>"Giant ape!" someone screamed.</p>

  <p>"It's the Giant Mountain Ape that is hiding in the Swirl Forest..."</p>

  <p>"It's only a fifth-level beast. It might not even be too difficult to deal with it..."</p>

  <p>All the same, the fact remained that it was very difficult for one top-rank True God to fight against a fifth-level beast.</p>

  <p>However, there were more than a hundred top-rank True Gods gathered together now, and each of them was ready for combat. For them, dealing with such a ferocious beast was as simple as pie.</p>

  <p>"Attack!" Luo Zheng shouted at the top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>A bright burst of light flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He quickly circled around in the sky on his flying sword!</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>As it grew more and more annoyed, the Giant Mountain Ape waved its thousand-foot long arm, in an attempt to pinch Luo Zheng flat between its finger and thumb.</p>

  <p>This wasn't Luo Zheng's first time facing the Giant Mountain Ape.</p>

  <p>Once before, he had been besieged by the giant apes in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>In fact, those giant apes had really put him under great pressure at the time.</p>

  <p>He still remembered it as if it happened yesterday.</p>

  <p>Now though, things had changed. He was much stronger than before.</p>

  <p>Although he was only a low-rank True God, his strength was extremely powerful!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was still standing on the flying sword, rolled slightly, like a nimble swallow. He passed through the Giant Mountain Ape's huge palm.</p>

  <p>With a somersault, Luo Zheng flipped over and kicked the flying sword toward the ape's arm.</p>

  <p>As the flying sword pierced the Giant Mountain Ape's skin in an instant, Luo Zheng grasped the sword's handle and ran upward along the ape's arm.</p>

  <p>The sharp flying sword, dragged by Luo Zheng and his ultimate force, immediately caused a huge gash in the giant ape's long arm!</p>

  <p>Blood poured out like a waterfall.</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>The Giant Mountain Ape went berserk in pain, screaming and yelling at the top of its lungs.</p>

  <p>It stretched its other hand and tried to grab Luo Zheng, but with every attempt, it failed anew.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ran all the way up and jumped directly onto the Giant Mountain Ape's shoulder!</p>

  <p>The Giant Mountain Ape turned around in a split-second. It bared its teeth, unexpectedly about to bite Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed again, even brighter this time.</p>

  <p>The strength source surged, and two invisible swords shot out. Both of them dug directly into the Giant Mountain Ape's eyes.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>The Giant Mountain Ape's two enormous pupils burst open at once.</p>

  <p>With another curdling howl, the Giant Mountain Ape covered its eyes with its hands and rolled on the ground in pain.</p>

  <p>It was at that exact moment that Yan's graceful figure floated over.</p>

  <p>She got close to the Giant Mountain Ape's head, seemingly reciting something.</p>

  <p>A purple light flashed in her black pupils at once, and a ring shadow shrouded the Giant Mountain Ape's head.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, she began to shout out loudly.</p>

  <p>"Entangle! Explode! Exterminate!"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the circular ring spun around and around, a peculiar white swirl immediately wrapped around the Giant Mountain Ape's head.</p>

  <p>It was then that Luo Zheng felt a strange force bursting outward from the Giant Mountain Ape's skull.</p>

  <p>The Giant Mountain Ape had infinite strength as well as a very strong life energy.</p>

  <p>Even though half of its head had been blown up, it still just wouldn't give in. It only became even more ferocious, instead.</p>

  <p>Its hair stood on end like spikes, and a tremendous power seemed to radiate out from its body in endless rays.</p>

  <p>It was at that very moment that things took a turn, however.</p>

  <p>It was as if an incredible invisible force had swept completely over them.</p>

  <p>The Giant Mountain Ape died suddenly and became nothing more than a heap on the ground.</p>

  <p>As he watched the scene play out before him, Luo Zheng sighed to himself and his heart sank. Yan's approach had been truly unreasonable.</p>

  <p>Now, he understood.</p>

  <p>The word 'entangle' was only to fix the Giant Mountain Ape's head without hurting it.</p>

  <p>And the word 'explode' would cause a violent explosion at a fixed place, which was in Giant Mountain Ape's head. In other words, like a ticking bomb, the ape's head had exploded to bits.</p>

  <p>Although these two methods were considered strange and uncommon, both were still acceptable.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the word 'exterminate' could have killed the Giant Mountain Ape immediately. Wasn't it too overbearing? The question was reasonable.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible to kill any living creature through the use of the 'exterminate' word trick?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Yan smiled faintly. "Of course not. I can only launch the attack under certain, specific conditions. Otherwise, the attack would be of no avail."</p>

  <p>"Under certain, specific conditions, huh? What conditions?" Luo Zheng asked, more eagerly this time.</p>

  <p>Yan blinked and said, "Only when the soul has become weak to a specific extent."</p>

  <p>The Giant Mountain Ape had a strong body, of course, but its soul wasn't particularly powerful. Despite that, Yan was still unable to destroy it.</p>

  <p>After she used the word 'explode' in order to damage its brain and severely hurt its soul, the 'exterminate' word gave way to its full effect.</p>

  <p>If she ever faced a few creatures with weak souls, she would be capable of uttering the word 'exterminate' to kill them off with ease.</p>

  <p>"In other words, it's a kind of soul attack. Am I right?" Luo Zheng asked, using his curious tone once again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are. Harold has said that if my soul is strong enough, I can almost kill all living creatures, even Holy Beings, through uttering a single word."</p>

  <p>Yan smiled with confidence. "Of course, my soul can't be strong to that extent. Not yet, at least."</p>

  <p>Such a token made Luo Zheng admire her so much, and Yan's ability had genuinely been beyond his wildest imagination.</p>

  <p>As for the other top-rank True Gods standing behind them, they were all stunned, their eyes wide as they stared at Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was holding his scabbard in his hand so tightly that his knuckles were turning white. His face was pale with embarrassment.</p>

  <p>He had planned to summon the disciples of the Sword Clan to attack the Giant Mountain Ape together, but to his surprise, Luo Zheng and his sister had killed it on their own. They did so with ease and in approximately ten seconds. Reinhard even had an illusion and was left wondering whether or not it was a fifth-level beast.</p>

  <p>Upon facing Luo Zheng and his sister, the beast had been too weak.</p>

  <p>After killing the Giant Mountain Ape, the team continued marching forward without hesitating.</p>

  <p>On their way, they encountered two more fear incarnations. However, these two fear incarnations were not as powerful as the ape they had defeated not long ago. Beneath Luo Zheng and his sister's lead, who appeared totally unbeatable, the others simply had no chance of fighting back.</p>

  <p>After having walked for dozens of miles, everyone began noticing at once that the mist in front of them was becoming very strange.</p>

  <p>The thick white mist dispersed at once from both sides and suddenly formed a passable path!</p>
