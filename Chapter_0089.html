<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to the records of beasts rankings in the Eastern Region, the ordinary blade locusts were considered level three monsters.</p>

  <p>However, the difference between other beasts that were level three and the blade locusts was that blade locusts never appeared alone.</p>

  <p>"If you come across a single blade locust, there are at least two thousand more behind that one!"</p>

  <p>Although it was an exaggeration, it showed just how vast the numbers were, and so the saying spread throughout the south.</p>

  <p>In the face of such vast numbers of blade locusts, refiners were afraid to deal with them, whether were half a step into the nature level or at nature level.</p>

  <p>At present, disciples from the Cloud Sect had managed to kill a few hundred blade locusts, because each one had good strength.</p>

  <p>Blade locust corpses were piled high around the wreckage, accumulating a body hill.</p>

  <p>No matter how high the pile of dead blade locusts got, it seemed endless amounts were coming at the disciples!</p>

  <p>"Aah!" came a sudden scream. It was a disciple rushing the blade locusts in a drastic move. Even if the others wanted to save him, it was too late. In an instant, a large group of locusts knocked him to the ground and were gnawing his limbs, until nothing remained and the blade locusts scattered.</p>

  <p>As the other disciples watched this gnarly scene, a shiver went through each of them.</p>

  <p>No one wanted to be the next to be ripped apart and eaten alive by these gruesome monsters.</p>

  <p>Wave on wave of blade locusts came at them though, and once everyone's energy was sapped, they would die.</p>

  <p>As the onslaught continued, the disciples felt their melancholy attitudes deepening within, and their attacks became weaker.</p>

  <p>It was now that one of the disciples shouted, "Cheer up! No slacking now, it's not that bad! We should counterattack! If we roll over and let them break us, we'll all die right here!"</p>

  <p>"Zing!" A purple energy arrow of life vitality was let loose, whizzing into the mass of blade locusts, and instantly thrusting through more than ten.</p>

  <p>"Bam!" Blazing flames exploded, coloring a patch of sky red. The powerful fire incinerated dozens of blade locusts, leaving the charred stench death in the air.</p>

  <p>It was the nature level refiners using their unique skills to fight.</p>

  <p>The others in their ranks were significantly encouraged by this display of force, and were reinvigorated, beginning to battle with all their strength.</p>

  <p>Rushing in and out among the horde of locusts, Luo Zheng used his power of Purple Light Fist. It was not all that powerful, yet, through the advantage of his body's strength, he killed eight blade locusts in a short time.</p>

  <p>In the heat of the battle, there was a scream, "Alert, everyone! Incoming, blade locust officers!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up, along with all the others fighting for their lives. The sight of dozens of purple blade locusts among legions of green ordinary blade locusts was approaching them. The purple officers were almost twice the size of the ordinary ones. They appeared hideous and misshapen and covering the skin on their bodies were dense bony thorns.</p>

  <p>'Are these purple monstrosities the blade locust officers?' wondered Luo Zheng. It was said a blade locust officer was far more potent than an ordinary blade locust, and here a few hundred were headed at them!</p>

  <p>The ordinary blade locusts were challenging enough to kill, let alone the stronger blade locust officers.</p>

  <p>The screeching blade locust officers dove from high above in the sky, while more blade locusts surrounded the disciples.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt an overwhelming feeling of gloom within, pondering, 'Are we going to die here today?'</p>

  <p>Who could have foreseen this outcome while boarding the giant flying chariot?</p>

  <p>In fact, while blade locust hunting was difficult, situations as dangerous like this, rarely happened.</p>

  <p>From the jungle near them, a branch of burning bamboo came flying in at that moment, with a "whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Thick smoke billowed from the end of the bamboo impaled in the ground.</p>

  <p>A strong scent of herb came from the smoke filling the air. Sniffing, Luo Zheng breathed it in.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, more burning bamboos flew into the midst of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Every bamboo was billowing with smoke from one end.</p>

  <p>Soon, the air was filled with smoke.</p>

  <p>Amazingly, the blade locusts feared the smoke and spread their wings, taking off into the skies above at sight of the burning bamboos. Circling the disciples below, the locusts remained above, not daring to descend on them.</p>

  <p>The same thing happened with the blade locust officers.</p>

  <p>Although the smoke was making the disciples uncomfortable, they were able to bear it and were given a reprieve from the locust attacks.</p>

  <p>A 'swishing' sound was heard coming from the woods before a large number of serious looking men appeared at the edge of trees, all dressed in uniforms, marching in unison, and each carrying bamboo sticks on their backs.</p>

  <p>"It's the imperial army!" whispered more than one of the disciples at the sight of the imperial army. The Cloud Sect disciples visibly relaxed.</p>

  <p>The Burning Sky Empire would send a considerable number of the imperial army yearly to war the Insect Aggression.</p>

  <p>Compared with the Cloud Sect disciples, the imperial army had unified action and a good sense of discipline. While the individual strength of an imperial soldier might not be comparable to a single Cloud Sect disciple, the unified power of the imperial army shouldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The imperial army formed orderly rows, and then a young man with a crew cut stepped forward and spoke earnestly, "I am Martin Lu, the centurion of the Green Haze Group! Disciples of the Cloud Sect, listen carefully! If you want to live, follow us!"</p>

  <p>After Martin Lu issued his commands, the Cloud Sect disciples stood there, staring at blade locust corpses piled high.</p>

  <p>They came here to earn points, not for a holiday.</p>
