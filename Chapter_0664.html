<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The head of the Dragon Abyss Palace had flown straight into the black ball and was devoured in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock right above the black ball was uncontrollably surging with immense destructive power. However, she was still kept safe and sound somehow.</p>

  <p>The second she soared into the black ball, the only reaction she had was,</p>

  <p>"Huh?" with her gorgeous eyes wide open...</p>

  <p>She had more than enough strength to hold back the strongest Owl Beast, so defeating such a weak one would be a walk in the park.</p>

  <p>The thing that managed to surprise her was not the Owl Beast itself, but Zheng's soul just lying in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Owl Beast just vanished without a trace! The only thing she could make out was Zheng's soul resting in the middle of the darkness.</p>

  <p>Just what could have possibly happened here? How the heck did all of this happen? And where in the world did the Owl Beast go? Baffled and left utterly dumbfounded, the head of Dragon Abyss Palace had a hard time wrapping her mind around what on earth had just transpired.</p>

  <p>"Bang... Bang..."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the other portions of the Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock simply persisted on overflowing with an endless supply of thundering light. Zheng's soul was repeatedly getting bent out of shape with diverse colors, which looked much like the oil on the water drifting away into vibrant ripples.</p>

  <p>"Wow! This is unbelievable! His soul could end up bursting forth into the level of the Fighting Soul!" Upon noticing that, she was beginning to get serious, with her curiosity quite piqued. Elder Wei had briefed her that Zheng had undergone a baptism by laws, so she immediately flew straight toward the black ball solely for the purpose of helping Zheng.</p>

  <p>Little did she know that Zheng could probably attempt reaching the level of Fighting Soul! 'Isn't he someone on the nature level? Just what exactly did he do to be capable of reaching the level of Fighting Soul in such a short span of time?'</p>

  <p>She was completely perplexed, because all throughout her whole life, she had only witnessed a handful of skillful warriors— who were either on or above the level of Internal Elixir— successfully reach the level of Fighting Soul. Come to think of it, even some of the ones already on the level of Virtual Tribulation Realm had failed to reach the Fighting Soul level. Surely, this was a special one!</p>

  <p>Lifting her head up a little, the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace walked over to where Zheng was. When she stretched out her arms and extended her hand, a dark red pill appeared out of her white wrist. The pill, rather than being round, actually had an unusual shape, and it was bouncing continuously, akin to a living creature.</p>

  <p>Slowly but surely, she carefully tossed the pill forward and it went right into Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Zheng was dead set and focused on breaking through the higher level no matter what, he somehow still managed to notice a girl wearing palace clothes, who had been standing in a place not too far away from him, pulling out a weird object and throwing it at him. That being said, the only thing that shifted was the look on his face, because this was just such a crucial moment for him in order to reach the Fighting Soul level.</p>

  <p>"No reason to be alarmed! The pill is essential and it can also be of great assistance to your soul," he perceived the voice of the cyan dragon inside his head. To be triumphant over the Owl Beast, the cyan dragon had actually gone the extra mile, and now, he was already worn-out, so he thought that it would suffice to simply remind Zheng without mentioning any further details.</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, those words were enough to help Zheng ease up and let the pill pierce straight into his soul.</p>

  <p>The pill, much like red ink fanning out in the water, scattered everywhere the moment it entered Zheng's soul, Due to the effects of the pill, every color moving all over Zheng's soul accumulated much faster and as for his soul, it gradually became much more rigid. Upon reaching a certain extent, a red light suddenly illuminated him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul returned to his body without incident the second the red light emerged, and with that, the first thing he did was open his eyes.</p>

  <p>If a person's soul had enough strength, his eyes would be shining with radiance and vitality. That was how they were able to track down some of the most powerful men whose eyes were shining brightly and burning with energy.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were glowing remarkably just like two stars soaring in the dark sky, letting it be known to some masters that Zheng had successfully attained the Fighting Soul level.</p>

  <p>The Fighting Soul was just a castle in the air hopelessly being chased after by most warriors.</p>

  <p>If one was fortunate enough to reach the Fighting Soul level, his soul would be completely altered, making him significantly stronger than ever before! At this point, the soul wasn't weak in any way whatsoever, and it even had the ability to attach itself to leaves or falling petals perhaps to engage in battle with an enemy. That was the reason why people had been saying time and time again that falling leaves and flowers could become deadly through the skills of a powerful warrior.</p>

  <p>But when all were said and done, it could be beyond a mere mortal's capability to reach the Fighting Soul level.</p>

  <p>Only a select few amongst all of the warriors on the Internal Elixir level could hope to train and reach the Fighting Soul level for the sake of increasing the strength of their soul! A majority of the warriors in the Virtual Tribulation Realm couldn't ever reach the Fighting Soul level in their lifetime!</p>

  <p>Zheng, a warrior whose prior achievement was reaching the nature level, had attained the Fighting Soul level. What an astonishing feat!</p>

  <p>The warriors who had experienced training side-by-side with Zheng were not as surprised as opposed to everyone else, the reason being that they had witnessed first-hand Zheng's progress and rapid improvement and they also watched as Zheng stepped into the inner circle from the outer circle in order to move closer to the Owl Beast.</p>

  <p>Dennis, Wei, Alan, and a few other people weren't able to see what occurred in the black ball, and all they knew was that a guy who was at the nature level shouldn't have been capable of reaching the Fighting Soul level at all. It was an utterly inconceivable idea in their eyes.</p>
