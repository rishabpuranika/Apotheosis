  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were several figures on the huge tombstones and all of them used the Grand Teleportation technique all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A number of space channels appeared and with them came Mike, Holy Jay, Bromley, Jeremiah and Joy.</p>

  <p>When they stopped, there was a head biting a tombstone before them.</p>

  <p>It had just made its way into the Ruin Graveyard and was twice its original size.</p>

  <p>"I'll go first. Holy Jay, follow me," ordered Bromley.</p>

  <p>"What about me?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"You guard the rear," said Holy Jay chuckling.</p>

  <p>Mike sulked, feeling helpless.</p>

  <p>A Holy Being's strength was similar to that of a warrior at the fifth or sixth stage of the Other Shore Realm. However, with a powerful Other Shore Token, the Holy Being's strength would double.</p>

  <p>Mike had borne the butterfly as instructed by the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Shortly after, the Mysterious Yellow Tower had been destroyed and he now wouldn't even have a chance to go change this Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>What the hell was this! What was going on!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A huge seal appeared above Bromley's head. It appeared to be carved with the ghost rock on Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. It was a seal of extraordinary quality and was carved out by none other than the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's fourth disciple, Justin.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>In a flash, Bromley appeared near the giant head.</p>

  <p>These heads would usually attack living creatures.</p>

  <p>But now, they seemed to gorge themselves on the tombstones, unable to pull themselves away and react to their surroundings.</p>

  <p>"The Punishment Seal!"</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>The seal continued to cover the head, creating marks all across its surface.</p>

  <p>"Let's make our move, now!"</p>

  <p>Bromley roared once he'd placed the seal.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Joy, Holy Jay, Mike and Jeremiah then appeared around the head and attacked the marks at the same time.</p>

  <p>They didn't exert so much strength, each of them only releasing one divine megaton of power.</p>

  <p>Yet in three seconds, they had already attacked the marks dozens of times.</p>

  <p>Such an amount of power might not cause any damage to the head, but it could trigger the Punishment Seal!</p>

  <p>Each time the Punishment Seal was triggered, a force pierced through the internal space and spread into the target's body. The force was so powerful that it could not be fought against.</p>

  <p>This was the power of the Punishment Seal!</p>

  <p>The head carried nothing and continued munching down on the tombstone. Hundreds of incredible powers began circulating within it and after a slight tremble, countless cracks broke out from the surface and shattered the ground beneath.</p>

  <p>"We killed another one!" Joy yelled with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Killing one is no easy task," replied Holy Jay, his eyes filled with worry.</p>

  <p>There were too many heads...</p>

  <p>Usually, if the creatures were large in number, each individual was very weak. But here, each head was extremely powerful. Zeke, the Holy Being, had accidentally been swallowed by one of the heads and could now do nothing more than restore his body in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Find another target," said Mike.</p>

  <p>They were about to use the Grand Teleportation technique when a massive monster suddenly rushed over from close by. It was a head, a hundred times larger than the rest!</p>

  <p>It moved unimaginably fast and before they even knew what was going on, a large mouth covered them, attempting to swallow them in a single gulp.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings used the Grand Teleportation technique and disappeared. They appeared in the sky, over a hundred miles above, all harboring a lingering fear.</p>

  <p>If they had reacted too slowly, they would have no doubt all been killed.</p>

  <p>"Where is Jeremiah?" Bromley suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay scanned their surroundings and revealed in horror, "I'm afraid he was devoured!"</p>

  <p>"We'll kill it together!" Joy yelled, frowning deep in anger.</p>

  <p>"We are no match for a head a hundred times stronger than the last one.</p>

  <p>Let's get out of here!" Bromley bellowed, decisively ordering a retreat.</p>

  <p>Just then, a figure walked out of the space channel.</p>

  <p>"It's Tianming!"</p>

  <p>The sight of Tianming lit them up.</p>

  <p>The younger generation had now completely surpassed Holy Beings like them. The strength of Hallet, Augustus and other disciples all surpassed Bromley's.</p>

  <p>Tianming was the most remarkable of them all and seemed to be the strongest warrior in the Ruin Graveyard!</p>

  <p>He nodded to the Holy Beings and took out a sword.</p>

  <p>It was the Lone Sword!</p>

  <p>It was only once he had the sword in his possession did Tianming realize how terrifyingly powerful it was.</p>

  <p>The sword had the endless destructive power and he had still yet to tap into its full potential!</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The destructive power continued flowing around the Lone Sword and even Tianming, with a clear mind, was affected by the violence within it. He waved his sword with a glimmer of enjoyment shining through.</p>

  <p>The power that radiated off tore the incomprehensibly massive head into pieces, snapping it like dry branches.</p>

  <p>"Amazing! A truly astonishing power!" praised Joy.</p>

  <p>Mike stood complacent, his hands tucked behind his back. Tianming was from his Evolutionary Universe after all.</p>

  <p>Tianming was a stark contrast, however. He held the Lone Sword in his hands, an indescribable struggle visible on his face.</p>

  <p>He was clearly incompatible with the devastating power the sword contained.</p>

  <p>When he had first noticed the Lone Sword and set himself on retrieving it, it did not possess such destructive power.</p>

  <p>Something must have happened to the Lone Sword before he reached the thirty-third floor.</p>

  <p>Tianming's intuition was sharp, but he had never expected Geoffrey to have tampered with the holy pillar and changed the position of the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>This "modification" was both a repair and an enhancement.</p>

  <p>The Lone Sword was at the eleventh stair, second only to the Snake Spirit King's Holy Items.</p>

  <p>Even so, Tianming didn't like it...</p>

  <p>He cupped his hands towards the Holy Beings and was about to teleport away using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred heads in the Ruin Graveyard that were a hundred times larger than ordinary heads. Hallet and Augustus couldn't deal with them and had to rely on Tianming to kill them alone.</p>

  <p>Just as Tianming was about to leave, a voice suddenly came from the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>"You are too slow. They will grow a thousand times or even ten thousand times larger than they are now, before you can kill them. With the power of this sword, you will not be able to kill them at all."</p>

  <p>The voice startled Tianming. "Who are you? Who is inside my sword?" he asked immediately.</p>

  <p>Bromley, Mike and the others were confused as well when they saw Tianming's reaction.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Wisps of souls condensed on Tianming's sword, and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and his four disciples appeared all at once.</p>

  <p>"You are the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower!" said Tianming utterly surprised.</p>

  <p>"The owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?"</p>

  <p>"Why is he hiding in the Lone Sword?"</p>

  <p>Not far away, Bromley, Holy Jay and the others were surprised and pleased by what they heard.</p>

  <p>If the old man really was the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, then he must also be the owner of the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>"It's me," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord replied flatly.</p>

  <p>"Sir, do you have a way to save the Ruin Graveyard?" Tianming asked hurriedly.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord looked around the Ruin Graveyard. The huge heads in the distance were still madly devouring everything they could, growing rapidly. "When I designed this area, I knew this day would come. But I only have one chance at this."</p>
