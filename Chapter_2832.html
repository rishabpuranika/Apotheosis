<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2832 Rachelle's Death </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The aura emitted by the Furnace of Dark and Light was originally scattered across a wide area.</p>

  <p>But right now, the aura was getting more and more concentrated.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, which was compressing, became denser, as if it was a real entity. The pressure exerted on everyone's head became greater.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings could withstand it.</p>

  <p>However, some of the consummate True Gods just couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's face had turned deathly pale.</p>

  <p>She took out a small jade pendant from her space ring and gently covered it with her hands. The pendant emitted a warm soul force.</p>

  <p>The jade pendant was a gift from her father and it was used to save her life.</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light, which didn't belong to anybody, was inside the jade pendant.</p>

  <p>After she placed the jade pendant on her forehead, the pressure of the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos decreased. She began to feel better.</p>

  <p>But the jade pendant's soul power was limited. In about nine seconds, the surface of the jade pendant began to dim.</p>

  <p>Although Rachelle could still rely on the soul weapon to protect herself from the pressure, the other consummate True Gods weren't so lucky.</p>

  <p>A consummate True God from the Zhao Clan had his eyes wide open and he was gritting his teeth. He did not have a soul weapon, so he had to survive without any help.</p>

  <p>When he reached his limit, he suddenly let out a cry. His eyes rolled backwards into his head and his soul was completely shattered.</p>

  <p>"Hooo!"</p>

  <p>He was unable to resist the gravity from the center of the whirlpool and floated towards Nicholas's body. He went inside Nicholas's body and merged with him.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>A consummate True God from the Fang Clan, too, couldn't stand the pressure anymore. He roared madly and rushed towards Nicholas's body as well.</p>

  <p>He chose to commit a suicide explosion the moment he fused with Nicholas's body!</p>

  <p>The inner world of the consummate True God was perfect so the power that emanated from the spontaneous explosion wasn't to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Nicholas was covered in a dazzling light with a deafening thud.</p>

  <p>However, what happened next was very bizarre. The blast wave that erupted accumulated inside Nicholas's body.</p>

  <p>"Did it get absorbed by Nicholas?"</p>

  <p>"He is capable of absorbing the blast wave produced by a self-explosion too."</p>

  <p>"What is this amazing method that he's using?"</p>

  <p>The crowd became even more desperate when they saw this scene.</p>

  <p>Zheng also frowned slightly. When the Shadow Bearing Sword broke just now, he surrendered it, and the sword disappeared. It should have been absorbed by Nicholas.</p>

  <p>His Furnace of Dark and Light was able to refine everything. Then what would the furnace produce in the end?</p>

  <p>Judging the situation, Nicholas's choice would definitely cause him to perish in the end. Even if he refined and produced something, he probably wouldn't be able to get it himself.</p>

  <p>"I'll fight you for it!"</p>

  <p>Another consummate True God couldn't stand it anymore. He took out a blood red saber, turned into a red light, and raced towards Nicholas.</p>

  <p>But he, along with the saber, directly got absorbed into Nicholas's body and disappeared.</p>

  <p>It was like his body was a black hole, swallowing everything that approached him.</p>

  <p>As the enormous whirlpool continued to shrink, the aura of the Eight Diagrams became more and more overpowering.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Eventually a fissure appeared on Rachelle's jade pendant. It was evident that the soul weapon had reached its limit.</p>

  <p>Realizing that she was bound to die today, she felt a trace of despair and sadness.</p>

  <p>In the last moments, her eyes finally fell upon Zheng.</p>

  <p>She wanted to kill Zheng at first sight. Just before she was about to die, she suddenly felt a sense of relief, and realized that her hostility towards Zheng was quite ridiculous.</p>

  <p>For so many years, all the members of the Mu Clan bowed to the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Her father had obeyed Nicholas all the time.</p>

  <p>Although the Mu Clan had gained a lot, it was still just a vassal of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was devoted to serving her clan wholeheartedly, and so she was firmly on the side of the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect to end up in such a situation where she would get killed by Nicholas!</p>

  <p>She was just a tool from the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>It was all so silly!</p>

  <p>Her hatred towards Zheng was even more hilarious.</p>

  <p>If she put aside the hatred, she knew that Zheng was a good person. His sister had a good eye for men. Now Rachelle was thinking that she probably shouldn't have grounded Nelly on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Her heart was filled with regret so she flew towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression was wary when he saw Rachelle dashing towards him.</p>

  <p>Among all the consummate True Gods of the alliance of powerful clans, Rachelle was the one who wanted to kill him the most and the craziest one.</p>

  <p>Who knew what she would do at this moment?</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Zheng asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>"Can I ask you for one thing?" she managed to say in between catching her breath.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng asked flatly.</p>

  <p>"If you... can leave here alive, can you take my sister away from the Floating Island please?" Rachelle begged.</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised. He never expected Rachelle to say something like that in her last moments.</p>

  <p>"Please! I have always been independent and never asked anyone for help in my life!" Rachelle said desperately.</p>

  <p>There was a look of despair on her delicate face.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never seen her this way. Her pleas melted his heart.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what had come over her...</p>

  <p>"It looks like I can't leave either," Zheng said with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>"Promise me, please!" Rachelle implored anxiously.</p>

  <p>She could already hear the sound of her soul cracking under the unbearable pressure. She wouldn't be able to hold on for too long...</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slightly sympathetically.</p>

  <p>The corners of Rachelle's lips raised slightly, and a small smile replaced the anxiousness on her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>In terms of appearance, Rachelle was more beautiful than Nelly and she was energetic all the time. However, she was too domineering, and most men did not dare to look at her directly. Most of them treated her as a man.</p>

  <p>After the faint smile, her eyes suddenly lost their glow. Her entire body was like a leaf floating in the air, sucked away by the gravity of the huge whirlpool. She got pulled into Nicholas and entered his body...</p>

  <p>Rachelle was the last consummate True God to die.</p>

  <p>The mammoth whirlpool shrank to a width of five miles.</p>

  <p>Now it was the turn of the Demi-holy Beings who were still holding on for dear life!</p>

  <p>"Who can save me?"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Nicholas! Go to hell!</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be killed by him!"</p>

  <p>Some Demi-holy Beings were wailing, some were silent, and some were thinking about a solution at this critical moment.</p>

  <p>They were very powerful figures in the divine land. How could they accept this kind of a death?</p>

  <p>Zheng also shook his head. Of course, he was not willing to accept the result.</p>

  <p>However, the Eight Diagrams was like the True Demon Body. The dark energy and light energy were complementary to each other. How could any regular method break through it?</p>

  <p>The True Demon Body...</p>

  <p>Suddenly Zheng thought of something and said, "Come out!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The girl with the red eyes inside Zheng's body came out and stared at him with her big eyes.</p>
