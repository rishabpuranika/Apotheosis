<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 760 Immersion (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The minute the first batch of ink had been produced according to Luo Zheng's specifications, Luo Luo Zheng simultaneously laid out a sheet of paper, firmly holding a brush in his hand.</p>

  <p>The first container filled with ink was then given to Luo Luo Zheng. Carefully dipping the brush into the ink, he proceeded to draw the first stroke.</p>

  <p>As specified by the cyan dragon's plans, all in all, there were supposed to be 4, 901 divine textures in total within the bounds of the sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>This three-star divine texture which Luo Luo Zheng was drawing up was but one small part of the whole.</p>

  <p>The second Luo Zheng's runic brush came into contact with the sheet of paper, his soul force immediately activated the characteristics of the components in the ink, emitting a blaze of red light. It should be quite apparent that this rune in particular was an offensive one with fire attribute!</p>

  <p>The tip of the brush moved gracefully on the paper akin to a stream of fire, steadily painting the paper. The marking and figures on the paper looked just like blossoming flames.</p>

  <p>Watching intently as Luo Luo Zheng casually used his Perfect Brushwork with such ease, Felix couldn't help himself from feeling so enthralled.</p>

  <p>Out of everyone present in Cloud Hall, if there was going to be just one person who was most pleased, it might very well be Felix. When it came to martial arts, he could easily be regarded as a heaven-level talent. In spite of that, though, all his life, he always had this obsession with runes. Thus, even up until now, he was still merely a martial artist in the Internal Elixir Realm. If he were to pick one between Cloud Hall and runes, there was no doubt that he'd go for the runes.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the fact that Felix didn't have the ability to perform the Perfect Brushwork, the feeling he had through simply watching Luo Luo Zheng draw those runes was something priceless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's grip was firm and his arms were stable, his motions seemed so tranquil and fluid. Having that level of finesse, even the most complex runes could probably be drawn smoothly. It didn't take too long before a three-star divine texture was finished.</p>

  <p>Without standing up, he simply gestured over to someone next to him. The assistant immediately grabbed the divine texture from him and set it somewhere in the hall to let the air dry up the ink written on the paper.</p>

  <p>After that, he began drawing a second divine texture, then a third?</p>

  <p>For the next twelve hours, without stopping to take a breather, Luo Luo Zheng just kept on drawing runes one after the other. The brush he was holding never stopped for even a minute.</p>

  <p>Actually, just after the first two hours, Felix had asked Luo Luo Zheng if he would like to take a break to get some rest, but Luo Luo Zheng just shook his head and vehemently continued drawing.</p>

  <p>Felix never could've imagined that he would go on twelve hours nonstop!</p>

  <p>Drawing runes would eat up a considerable amount of soul force. Even though the soul of a runic expert was far stronger than an ordinary martial artist's, drawing for twelve hours straight was still a feat that was quite unheard of.</p>

  <p>In Central Region, Felix was among the best runic experts. He had actually been a disciple once in the Runic Tower. At the time when he left the tower, he possessed enough soul force to be ranked in the tower's top ten. And yet even then, after merely constructing five runes, he would immediately feel nauseated, needing a couple of days to take some rest before he could draw again.</p>

  <p>That was the main reason why Felix truly believed that constructing a sect-protecting array would need about a year, possibly even a number of years to be completed. Drawing runes was worlds apart from just drawing some random graffiti. But as Luo Luo Zheng did it, he made it appear as though he was just drawing some graffiti artwork. He made the process look so easy, when it was in fact far from that, much too far from that.</p>

  <p>Felix had no clue how strong Luo Zheng's soul was, whatsoever. But to be completely fair, who would have actually thought that a young warrior from the Illuminating Soul Realm possessed something like a soul of the Fighting Soul Realm?!</p>

  <p>After drawing continuously for twelve hours straight, Luo Luo Zheng eventually sensed a feeling of exhaustion. This was the consequence for pushing his soul force too hard. He abruptly stopped what he was doing. And by the end of that twelve-hour stint, on one side of the hall, more than two hundred three-star divine textures were tidily piled up together.</p>

  <p>If he could somehow manage to put out this much divine textures, the process should be finished in about one month.</p>

  <p>At that point, Felix was totally astounded. Apart from how difficult it was to draw up runes which he couldn't comprehend in any way, drawing one-star runes for twelve hours nonstop would have already driven him to his wit's end.</p>

  <p>'This young man must have a soul made of iron!' he deeply pondered, still feeling so amazed.</p>

  <p>Upon taking a much-needed good night's rest, Luo Luo Zheng was able to replenish his stamina and began drawing divine textures once again. The helpers inside the hall also had their hands full with dissecting the materials, hanging them to dry, and then grinding them. All of these methods might sound easy, but they were also quite intricate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the temperature around the hall seemed to have gone down a little. Ning Yudie came flying in. The assistants and stewards who were much too busy moving around the hall all stopped in their tracks and bowed to her, but Ning Yudie simply waved her hand over to them, gesturing not to cause Luo Luo Zheng any distractions.</p>

  <p>Her eyes, which seemed to be just as warm as the sun, were glistening intensely. Akin to a peaceful valley, she had her gaze fixated on Luo Luo Zheng with a revitalizing and pure allure.</p>

  <p>As all of that was happening, Luo Luo Zheng had been completely oblivious to it. The only thing he wanted to do was to focus on his brush as he immersed himself into the world of divine textures.</p>
