<br/><br/>

  

  <p>This was the case wherein the upper-level warriors of Oracle City had to fight against the lower-level warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect.</p>

  <p>All Internal Elixir Realm warriors and Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors were separated into small teams. Each team moved in batches, raiding the Heavenly Evil Sect's army and constantly trying to prevent them from total invasion and occupation. This strategy had been decided jointly by the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>The method had proved very effective, in the beginning. The Heavenly Evil Sect was still in the stage of saving-up their strength so no upper-level warriors could be sent out to counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, recent events had seen more of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance's forces being decimated in greater numbers. Many of those who perished were at the middle and even late stages of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>While on his way to accept a mission, Luo Zheng coincidentally bumped into Tianming and the others.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Patrick, and Lewis had just finished a mission issued to them half a month ago and were on their way of accepting a new one.</p>

  <p>Thus, at Zheng's request, the four of them naturally formed a team.</p>

  <p>Lewis was very happy that they had Luo Zheng in their team. He still remembered how brave and remarkable the young man had been in the past.</p>

  <p>All three of them had long since agreed that Zheng's strength was already equal to that of a Life and Death Realm warrior. With a talent like that in their team, they knew that any difficulties they would face out in the field would be solved very easily. In short, there was a higher probability of survival in their team. Such thought pleased them very much.</p>

  <p>"Now that Luo Zheng has joined us, we have to change our team name! I think we should call it Red Maple Team!"</p>

  <p>Lewis declared with a smile.</p>

  <p>Tianming, however, did not really agree and sent him a cold glare, "It's an awful name."</p>

  <p>"Awful? How is this possible? Well, if you don't like it, we can call it…</p>

  <p>Lewis Team!" he suggested once again with a grin.</p>

  <p>But Tianming shook his head in disappointment. "That's even more terrible!"</p>

  <p>The four of them were currently flying at a low altitude but Luo Zheng slowed down and interrupted the brewing argument. "How about Eudemon Team?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Eudemon... It's a good name!" Patrick said, nodding his head in agreement.</p>

  <p>The word meant guardian angel and benevolent spirit. Lewis, however, was a bit unhappy, "The name is too strange. I don't understand it at all and it's not as great as the ones I came up with..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish, he heard a loud 'whoosh' sound behind him. Tianming had drawn out his sword which made Lewis immediately shut his mouth.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the newly formed Eudemon Team arrived at a place one thousand four hundred miles to the east of Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect had initially expanded from the east and invaded most of the northeastern area. However, the siege of Ethereal City effectively made them the main occupier of the Central Region's entire eastern area.</p>

  <p>The four of them stood on top of a mountain overlooking a nearby city.</p>

  <p>"This city is called Melody City," Tianming said, taking out his map and comparing it to the city in front of him. "It's small and only has a population of less than four hundred thousand."</p>

  <p>To compare to the population of other cities, Oracle City, a super city, had a population of over one hundred million while Ethereal City and Cloudy City, which were considered just large cities, already had tens of millions of mortals and warriors living within their walls.</p>

  <p>Thus, Melody City, with a population of just four hundred thousand, was indeed small.</p>

  <p>"Although it has a small population, it has an important military base,"</p>

  <p>Patrick spoke. "The Heavenly Evil Sect is currently building a transmission array here since the city is located in such a strategic area."</p>

  <p>The mission this time was not to bring down the Heavenly Evil Sect's forces but to destroy the said transmission array. The construction would not be completed in just a day but it was expected that many powerful warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect would be stationed there as guards.</p>

  <p>A look of cowardice crossed Lewis's features. "Can the four of us really destroy the transmission array?"</p>

  <p>Patrick and Tianming simply ignored Lewis's fears. They were already used to his timid nature and cowardice. Besides, despite his fears, Lewis was someone who constantly accepted new missions so it could be that he was someone who merely pretended to be cowardly.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Tianming declared and the whole team followed.</p>

  <p>Although Melody City was under the Heavenly Evil Sect's control, most of the residents were mortals and warriors were rarely seen. They figured that the transmission array was secretly under construction since sending out too many warriors could arouse suspicion from the Oracle City members.</p>

  <p>However, what the Heavenly Evil Sect did not know was that news of their construction plans had already spread. Luo Zheng now led the mission of destroying the transmission array.</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered, their entire team was immediately smothered by peddlers offering their specialties. Luo Zheng and the others did not travel to the city for relaxation and effectively ignored these mortals.</p>

  <p>The four of them immediately set out to explore. The city wasn't too large and Luo Zheng was able to spread out his senses in order to find any space fluctuations that would indicate the location of the transmission array.</p>

  <p>However, even if all four of them had spread out their senses, not one of them was able to discover any space fluctuations.</p>

  <p>"Something is wrong," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"I also feel that something is wrong!" Lewis agreed. He had been feeling extremely nervous ever since they entered the city and it was said that cowards had the innate talent of sensing trouble to run for their lives. Lewis was a person with such high cowardice skills. As long as he sensed something wrong, he would maintain constant vigilance against his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Tianming quickly glanced around. A lot of mortals abounded the streets when they entered the city.</p>

  <p>These mortals were indifferent to the sect war currently happening between the Heavenly Evil Sect, and the joint force of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance. No matter who came out victorious or controlled their city had nothing to do with them.</p>

  <p>"Those people have disappeared," Tianming muttered in realization when he saw the now empty streets in front of them.</p>

  <p>Patrick was also vigilant. Suddenly, he pointed at the low city wall. The three others looked up and noticed a light blue enchanted barrier that had suddenly appeared and enveloped the entire small city.</p>

  <p>At this time, the mortals that had disappeared earlier suddenly opened their doors and walked out of their homes.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with these people?" Lewis muttered in curiosity.</p>

  <p>More and more people had come out and filled the streets. All of them were glassy-eyed and kept walking back and forth. They were clearly still alive but looked like zombies devoid of any vitality.</p>

  <p>"We might be in trouble," Luo Zheng said before looking at Tianming. "Stay here!"</p>

  <p>Even though there was no formally designated leader, it was apparent to everyone that Luo Zheng was the key figure of their team.</p>

  <p>Tianming obeyed, unsheathing his sword and sitting crossed-leg in the sidewalk. He closed his eyes tightly and began to gather his strength.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of how extra cautious Luo Zheng had been acting, which probably meant that he was about to meet extremely formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>Tianming would naturally also be on high alert.</p>

  <p>Patrick and Lewis were the same. They both knew these mortals posed no immediate threat but they kept their guard up just in case.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly shot out of the sky and rushed towards the blue enchanted barrier. However, before he could even approach, a faint chuckle stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! It seems today is my lucky day! Who would've thought I'd be able to catch a middle-stage Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior with the cage I set up in Melody City!" a loud, sharp voice remarked.</p>

  <p>It was the voice of a child, probably three or four years old.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Luo Zheng asked, staring up at the blue enchanted barrier with caution.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a faint figure materialized hazily on top of the barrier. It had the outline of a person but it didn't feel like one. Luo Zheng could only guess that what he was seeing in front of him was a soul, or rather, the projection of a soul.</p>

  <p>It was a skill that even Luo Zheng had never seen before in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Of course, within the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, Xun had used a similar technique to talk to the Demon Night queen from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, that happened beyond the scope of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Luo Zheng repeated. "Answer me!"</p>

  <p>The hazy figure grew clearer and revealed a small boy with tender skin and an incredibly cute face. However, his appearance did not match with the sheer cruelty that emanated from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to know who I am. Once you enter my Spirit Container, you will just have to die, just like those guys," the child spoke viciously but his face looked extremely innocent.</p>

  <p>"The Spirit Container?" Luo Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>The boy nodded and smiled coldly, "I don't mind telling you. If I gather the soul power of several hundred thousand mortals in this small city, I can project my soul! And I have the Fighting Soul!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly ruminated from the boy's words. It seemed that most of the Virtual Tribulation Realm elders who died in the war had been killed by this boy whose Fighting Soul made it difficult for even Life and Death Realm masters to resist him.</p>

  <p>"You're not from the Central Region, right?" Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>The boy snorted, "Does it matter? Just go die. Then I'll tell you!" The boy gave Luo Zheng one of his cold smiles before suddenly rushing into his mind. He obviously wanted to use his Fighting Soul to directly exterminate Zheng's soul.</p>
