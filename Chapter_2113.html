<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2113 Black Birds And Bugs </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This Soul-shaking Mastiff was much smaller than the giant white ape in size, but it was nonetheless extremely powerful as it was a true spirit.</p>

  <p>As the Soul-shaking Mastiff chomped down on the giant white ape, a crisp sound that could send shivers down one's spine was heard!</p>

  <p>Within a few more seconds, the giant ape's thick arm was bitten straight off. Luo Luo Zheng got rid of the ape's grip and he fell down from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Awooo..."</p>

  <p>The giant white ape howled out in pain, its eyes gleaming with anger. It waved its other arm out in front of him and quickly sent a palm strike flying toward the Soul-shaking Mastiff!</p>

  <p>The Soul-shaking Mastiff reacted very fast, though.</p>

  <p>After biting off the giant white ape's arm, it once again leaped and dodged the giant ape's slap. It then climbed up the giant white ape's remaining arm. As soon as the Soul-shaking Mastiff reached the ape's shoulder, it pounced again, this time its mouth open wide with the intent to bite the white ape's throat!</p>

  <p>However, just as the Soul-shaking Mastiff was no more than a few feet away from the white ape's throat, a white shadow suddenly flashed past them and a mountain-like fist smashed directly down onto the Soul-shaking Mastiff.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>"Woo, woo..."</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a loud bang, the Soul-shaking Mastiff let out a blood-curdling screech as it was smashed down into the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly and unexpectedly, another giant ape had appeared outside the Immortal Mansion!</p>

  <p>The second giant ape was also white in color. In contrast though, this one had a clump of red fur on its head. It looked like a flame dancing above its head. "Awoo..." The giant red-furred ape let out a low growl. It was obvious that it was enraged, and with reason.</p>

  <p>Although the Soul-shaking Mastiff had been punched by the second white ape, the second it landed, it rolled over on the ground in an attempt to get up. It lowered its body and vigilantly looked at the two giant apes standing outside the Immortal Mansion. It too, roared in low voice and revealed its two long fangs, but it didn't dare pounce on them.</p>

  <p>It was only seconds ago that Luo Luo Zheng had struggled free from the white ape's arm. When he noticed that the Soul-shaking Mastiff was showing signs of fear, a strange expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>From Luo Zheng's point of view, the Soul-shaking Mastiff, known as "Blackie", was most likely extremely powerful. Although these two giant apes were powerful, there was no reason Blackie should be afraid of them. Blackie, on his behalf, didn't dare rush out of the Immortal Mansion just yet.</p>

  <p>Less than a split second later though, Luo Luo Zheng understood what the Soul-shaking Mastiff was afraid of!</p>

  <p>Outside the Immortal Mansion, more and more giant apes emerged from behind the walls and around the corners, one by one. In a very short period of time, more than ten apes had actually appeared. Each and every one of them very tall and strong.</p>

  <p>The first giant ape, the one who had attacked Luo Luo Zheng, had a completely white body. The second giant ape had a wisp of bright red fur that looked like raging flames on the top of its head. It was three times bigger than the first giant and was also much stronger. The apes that emerged now were even larger than that, and they all had red hair on their heads, too.</p>

  <p>In fact, the all-white giant ape was just a baby compared to these other apes. The red-haired giant apes stood outside the Immortal Mansion like a row of tall mountains, tightly surrounding the side of the Immortal Mansion!</p>

  <p>"Aoo..." they cried.</p>

  <p>Once all the apes had appeared, several huge black birds began appearing in the sky above. The black birds all had four pairs of wings, and the feathers on their bodies were protruding like long needles. It was difficult to condense the Wind Law enough to fly in the divine land, but these giant birds relied on their massive sets of wings to do so instead.</p>

  <p>"So many..." Luo Luo Zheng quietly uttered.</p>

  <p>There were a total of approximately sixty giant black birds circling around the Immortal Mansion. Just from the Mu Ning these giant black birds emanated, it was safe to assume that they weren't any weaker than the giant apes.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>And that wasn't the end of it. After the giant black birds appeared, numerous giant grey bugs started joining the masses.</p>

  <p>Although these giant grey bugs weren't as huge as the black birds and giant apes, each of them was as tall as a person. Moreover, they densely covered the ground, just like an enormous, scary grey cloud closing in from far away.</p>

  <p>In the middle of these giant grey bugs, a giant crimson bug was being carried by the other giant bugs. That giant crimson bug had a pair of compound eyes and seemed to be concentrating its thoughts on something as it stared at Luo Luo Zheng from a distance. It was obvious that the giant apes, black birds and the bugs in the Swirl Forest all had a very form of high intelligence.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Luo Zheng had only just taken control of this Immortal Mansion, and the Mu Ning exuded by these bizarre creatures of the divine land was almost comparable to that of a True God. Watching the scene play out before him, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help feeling a little panicked.</p>

  <p>'These guys are still thinking about the things beneath the Immortal Mansion, '</p>

  <p>Saul thought to himself as he too, watched the action take place. He then turned to Luo Luo Zheng and said, "Master, just activate all the killing arrays within the Immortal Mansion." Prior to this occurrence, Saul had wanted to guide Luo Luo Zheng gently in order to familiarize him with the Immortal Mansion's controls and had thus asked him to release Blackie. He had never expected that as soon as the bubble enchanted barrier covering the Immortal Mansion opened, all these strange creatures would surge out together, reacting very fast. It had been countless years since the bubble enchanted barrier had been opened the last time.</p>

  <p>"You're right! I should activate the arrays!"</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Luo Luo Zheng had taken complete control of the Immortal Mansion, and he was still a little unfamiliar with the latter. Only after hearing Saul's reminder did Luo Luo Zheng think of using the arrays.</p>

  <p>In reality, the reason why these creatures didn't attack was because they were afraid of the various killing arrays within the Immortal Mansion. The first white ape had attacked Luo Luo Zheng in order to test whether the killing arrays within the fairy place were ineffective or not. It would soon have its answer!</p>

  <p>As the number of vicious beasts gathered here increased, they also became more and more rowdy, unable to restrain themselves and capable of charging into the Immortal Mansion in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>"Awoo!"</p>

  <p>The white ape in the lead suddenly let out a loud, piercing howl. It opened its arms and moved over to the outer wall of the Immortal Mansion with the intent to climb over it. The black mass of strange birds and huge bugs also began circulating around restlessly.</p>

  <p>"Be quick!"</p>

  <p>Saul hissed hurriedly, with an anxious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's thoughts quickly flashed through his mind, and he opened up all of the killing arrays, not caring about the sequences they might have.</p>

  <p>"Huff..."</p>

  <p>From the depths of the Immortal Mansion, a seven-colored long sword slowly rose from the shadows. Even before it was in full sight, it began shooting out streams of colorful sword shadows!</p>

  <p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>

  <p>These colorful sword shadows shot out so fast, and they gave way to the perception that they could destroy anything. As the sword shadows pierced into the white apes, a large bloody hole was left in their bodies.</p>

  <p>When the sword shadows shot into the bodies of the giant grey bugs, the giant bugs were turned into the powder that looked like blackened ash.</p>

  <p>"Squeak, squeak..."</p>

  <p>"Awoo!"</p>

  <p>"Quack..."</p>

  <p>All sorts of screams could be heard around the Immortal Mansion as numerous ferocious beasts were killed by the colorful sword shadows!</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>A few colorful sword shadows hit the giant crimson bug from a distance, but a crisp metallic sound resisted the blade. It was unbelievable! The giant crimson bug was actually capable of blocking the colorful sword shadows' attack!</p>

  <p>These vicious beasts had suffered heavy casualties in such a short period of time, but they still wouldn't retreat. Instead, they split into three groups and respectively charged towards Luo Luo Zheng, Saul, and Blackie at full speed.</p>

  <p>However, when they passed through the Immortal Mansion's square and rushed into the inner courtyard, an illusionary little person without any expression on the face and a large hammer appeared on the pavilion. The illusionary person held the large hammer and struck at the pavilion with mighty force.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The hammer seemed to have hit a large gong as it produced an explosive sound. At the same time, an invisible force surged out from the ground beneath them and scattered out in all directions.</p>

  <p>This power had no effect on Luo Luo Zheng, Saul, and Blackie. However, it seemed to have a miraculous effect on the monsters in the Swirl Forest. The enormous monsters were trapped in this great flow of power and were pushed out of the Immortal Mansion with a gust of force!</p>

  <p>"Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak..."</p>

  <p>The giant crimson bug, on its behalf, was unwilling to be expelled so easily. It had keenly sensed Luo Zheng's existence and seemed to know that he was a key figure in the Immortal Mansion. It was at that moment that it opened its six pairs of bright red wings and charged towards Luo Luo Zheng, despite the onslaught of power. Despite its best efforts, the invisible force was very great and the bug's flying route in the air was crooked. Its speed was still shockingly fast and in the blink of an eye, it was only two or three short feet away from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>So close up, Luo Luo Zheng could now clearly see its detailed sickle-like mouthpart and smell the stench emitted by it.</p>

  <p>When the giant crimson bug opened its mouth to swallow Luo Zheng's head, beams of seven-colored light flew over once again. A saving grace!</p>

  <p>It turned out that the seven-colored long sword continued releasing sword shadows in order to kill the remaining vicious beasts. However, most of the vicious beasts had been pushed straight out of the Immortal Mansion by the surge of power just before. Now, the seven-colored long sword naturally aimed at its next target, the giant crimson bug.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>A cambered blood-red light appeared on the surface of this giant crimson bug, blocking the seven-colored sword. Despite its capacity to block the attack, its body was involuntarily pushed back by the sword shadows, and it kept getting further and further away from Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>It took a split second for Luo Luo Zheng to realize what was happening, but once he did, he turned around and ran, quickly dashing into the pavilion.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a second sound from the top of the pavilion, another surge of power flooded out in all directions. The giant crimson bug wanted to block the seven-colored sword shadows, but it no longer had enough strength to resist the torrent of power. Its body, as tall as a human being, rolled into the air and in the blink of an eye, it too, was sent flying directly out of the Immortal Mansion!</p>
