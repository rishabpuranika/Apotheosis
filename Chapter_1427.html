<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1427 The Second Sword Embryo </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The man in white nodded. "The Luster Force Secret Sect is the biggest secret sect of the human race. Do you have any interest in joining us?"</p>

  <p>Freya stood beside Zheng, the eyes beneath her thick lashes filled with curiosity.</p>

  <p>She was also an ascended warrior and did not know any better about the Upper World than Zheng. Previously, she had only gathered some information about Zheng's destination and so was able to answer his questions. But she had never learned anything about secret sect and had no idea what it was about.</p>

  <p>At the man's invitation, Zheng did not speak.</p>

  <p>The white-robed man did not force Zheng to give him an answer. Instead, he invited Zheng with utmost sincerity to follow him to the secret sect.</p>

  <p>Entering the grand and imposing building, Zheng saw people everywhere…</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of people present. Most were ordinary without any cultivation. They ranged from old men to children less than ten years old.</p>

  <p>At least a million people occupied the huge square.</p>

  <p>The people spread out in circles and knelt on the ground. They muttered something, bowing down before the center of the square.</p>

  <p id="top_21">People closer to the inner circle had a higher level of cultivation. About a dozen Spirit Supreme Realm masters were also present in the inner circle. The outer circle was basically filled with ordinary citizens.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze finally landed on the center of the square. In the center was a round, transparent sphere. At the bottom of this sphere was a kind of light green liquid which took up one third of the volume of the sphere.</p>

  <p>When Zheng looked at the sphere, he felt a faint soul pressure exuding from it.</p>

  <p>However, the soul pressure did not have any malicious intent. Neither did it have any kind purpose. It was merely emitting pressure that did not cause any effect.</p>

  <p>"This... What is it?" Freya asked.</p>

  <p>The white-robed man suddenly spread out his hands and said with a trace of a fervent worship on his face, "This is what we believe in. It's our God, still in its embryonic stage. As long as everyone gives their most sincere love, our True God will gradually grow and reveal Himself and deliver all living creatures from torment..."</p>

  <p>These were words that he had perhaps repeated countless times, for he said them with great fluency. It was similar to the way Freya had repeated the names of places on the map before. However, every glance and every action of the white-robed man complemented his words, and unknowingly, a listener could well be convinced and brainwashed.</p>

  <p>This method might work on mortals and even some martial artists with weak warrior spirits, however, Zheng did not feel anything, and even Freya's face revealed disapproval.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xun's voice came to his ears. "What he said sounded sanctified, but it's just for the sake of collecting the Faith Energy. The Supreme Lord of Original Sin has spent a hundred thousand years and used the Faith Energy of a trillion living creatures to hatch a sword embryo. This sword is now ranked second on the Universe Spirit Tablet. They are not satisfied and seem to use the old trick in hopes of hatching another sword embryo!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's words, Zheng suddenly remembered that Brianna had mentioned this to him before.</p>

  <p>"In other words, the transparent sphere in the middle of the square is in fact a sword embryo?" Zheng asked Xun silently.</p>

  <p>Xun shook her head and said, "This isn't a sword embryo. This is just a container for collecting the Faith Energy. The light green liquid inside is the Faith Energy they have accumulated over the years."</p>

  <p>Hearing what Xun said, Zheng concluded that there were perhaps countless divisions of the Luster Force Secret Sect in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The one here was merely one of its branches.</p>

  <p>The Luster Force Secret Sect gathered as many followers as they could to condense a sword embryo, so that they could obtain a super weapon which held immense power. It was indeed a brilliant idea.</p>

  <p>Although there was no emotion on Zheng's face, the white-robed man continued to endlessly preach the power of the Luster Force Secret Sect, as well as the benefits of joining them.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Zheng suddenly felt his spirit beast bag move.</p>

  <p>The space inside the spirit beast bag was not small by any means. Even if both the Heavenly Phoenix Horse and the Ancestral Dragon stayed together in the spirit beast bag, it should not be crowded in the slightest.</p>

  <p>What was the little dragon doing inside?</p>

  <p>Zheng released a strand of his perception into space to investigate what was happening in the bag.</p>

  <p>He discovered that the Ancestral Dragon was knocking on the walls of the spirit beast bag, as if wanting to escape it. Its movements were savage as its small head hit the edges of the space within the bag.</p>

  <p>As for the Heavenly Phoenix Horse, it seemed afraid of the Ancestral Dragon and kept a certain distance from it. At the same time, it stared vigilantly at the mad creature.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, now is not the time to come out." Zheng tried to pacify the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>Although the dragon was born not long ago, it was still quite obedient.</p>

  <p>After all, in the heart of the dragon, Zheng was his mother.</p>

  <p>But today, the Ancestral Dragon did not listen to Zheng. It kept knocking around the spirit beast bag…</p>

  <p>At this moment, the cyan dragon said indifferently, "The Ancestor Dragon has found its food."</p>

  <p>"Food?" Zheng was stunned to hear this. "What does it eat?"</p>

  <p>He did not know what the Ancestral Dragon liked to eat. In the past, it seemed to especially like eating what Margaret cooked. Besides that, it did not seem to need food at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng had asked the cyan dragon about this before. He had asked whether the little fellow needed to devour the Law Power to grow.</p>

  <p>But the cyan dragon did not give Zheng a clear answer. He only told Zheng that the Ancestral Dragon indeed had its food, but it was impossible for Zheng to obtain such food in a short period of time, so Zheng dropped the matter altogether. Anyway, it seemed like the little dragon could not starve even if it did not eat.</p>

  <p>And now the cyan dragon was saying that the Ancestral Dragon had discovered its food?</p>

  <p>According to what Brianna had said, the Ancestral Dragon was also a faith totem. Zheng followed this line of thought, and as his mind raced, he realized something. "Could it be that its food… is the Faith Energy?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, you got it right! Only by devouring the Faith Energy will the Ancestral Dragon truly grow," the cyan dragon answered and nodded.</p>

  <p>Zheng finally understood why the Ancestral Dragon was reacting this way upon entering the secret sect. It turned out that the Faith Energy was the food it had needed all along.</p>

  <p>"But I can't just let this little dragon devour the Faith Energy right now."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked helpless.</p>

  <p>For a shrine of the Luster Force Secret Sect, there was no way that powerful people did not guard it. As far as Zheng could see, quite a few powerful masters were among the millions of fanatics in front of them.</p>

  <p>There were several Spirit Supreme Realm masters in the inner circle.</p>

  <p>Surely even more powerful beings were in the secret sect to back up if something happened here.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon said in reply, "In truth, with the current strength of the Ancestral Dragon, it is impossible for any normal martial artist to injure it. If you let it out, it will find its own way to obtain the Faith Energy."</p>

  <p>Presently, the power of the Ancestral Dragon could not be considered very noteworthy. However, it had the talent of being immune to all Original Laws. It would be next to impossible for anyone to hurt it or try to capture it using uncommon tricks.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng could not release an Ancestral Dragon in the midst of so many people, just so it could devour the Faith Energy. The Faith Energy in the sphere had accumulated over an unfathomable number of years, and it was still not much. Realizing that the sphere would not be taken away anytime soon, Zheng knew that he needed to think carefully and work out a good plan if he wanted to help the Ancestral Dragon consume the Faith Energy. At the very least, he should observe first and find an opportunity later...</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Zheng prepared to leave.</p>

  <p>However, the white-robed martial artist who had been preaching all this time shifted, suddenly aware that Zheng was about to leave with Freya. He instantly stood before Zheng and tried to maintain an amiable manner as he asked, "Friend, now that you have visited our Luster Force Secret Sect, why don't you join us? If you join, you will get benefits you cannot imagine!"</p>

  <p>Zheng replied faintly, "I do not need any benefits."</p>

  <p>"Friend, having faith can purify your heart and mind. This will be good for you," the white-robed martial artist insisted with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I don't require any benefits, haven't I made myself clear?" Zheng looked indifferently at the man.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the white-robed warrior then said, "All living beings in Auspice City understand that one has only two choices after entering the shrine of our Luster Force Secret Sect. You can be carried out of this place dead, or you can kneel before the square… You see, those members of Demon Night who worshipped their queens also ended up joining our Luster Force Secret Sect!"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he pointed to an area in the square, where Zheng spotted a few members of the Demon Night.</p>
