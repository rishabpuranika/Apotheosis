<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had caused quite a stir in the lower stages of the Other Shore, but very little information had been transmitted to Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Although the Element Spirit race knew a lot about Luo Zheng, they wouldn't communicate any information about Luo Zheng with their subordinate races, which was why the members of the Violet Cloud race were all surprised to see his corporeal body.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," the powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm from the Violet Cloud race said, looking Luo Zheng up and down. "The Truth of Powerful Holy Body is forbidden in the current round of chaos, so your corporeal bodies should not have been able to enter here. How did you manage to do it, human?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you?" Luo Zheng retorted.</p>

  <p>At this, several members of the Violet Cloud race rushed towards him, the one leading them looking menacing. "Human, it's an honor to be asked a question by Elder Howe. You'd better answer his question honestly!"</p>

  <p>All the humans in the current round of chaos kept a low profile. Even a large number of Holy Soul Realm humans, including Pearce, in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore stayed out of the limelight. That was why the members of the Violet Cloud race weren't taking Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>"Or what?" Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>"Or..." the member of the Violet Cloud race faltered, taken aback at Luo Zheng's confidence. The Three Eyes race feared the Violet Cloud race because the members of the Violet Cloud race had a number of means of torturing them.</p>

  <p>But the humans from the Taiyi Heaven Palace were still under the protection in the Grand Plain Stage, and while this was so, the Violet Cloud race couldn't do anything to harm them.</p>

  <p>"Your alternative is that after this round of chaos, I will make sure that your Taiyi Heaven Palace disappears from the Grand Plain Stage," Elder Howe of the Violet Cloud race said, his voice booming.</p>

  <p>This obvious threat drew the attention of all the remaining Other Shore creatures that were present.</p>

  <p>All the Other Shore creatures, including the members of the Three Eyes race, looked at Luo Zheng in surprise. They were also curious, wondering why a human of the Holy Soul Realm dared refute the Violet Cloud race, and thought that he was courting death.</p>

  <p>Pearce, who had been standing silently to the side for quite a while, suddenly burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>Pearce and Auden were the most powerful officials in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, second only to Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying. But they were filled with anger every time they entered Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, and each time, they had had to swallow their anger and tolerate anything that came their way.</p>

  <p>They never dared compete with any other race on the Other Shore for the sake of the Taiyi Heaven Palace's long-term development. They always greeted the Other Shore races with broad smiles. When they explored the temples, they had to act according to the etiquette that these Other Shore races demanded.</p>

  <p>When the Violet Cloud race began to make things difficult for them, Pearce had thought about dealing with them in the usual manner. But on second thought, he realized that the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Element Spirit race had already come to an open break since the Element Spirit race had trapped Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying.</p>

  <p>Since the disparity in strength was huge, begging for mercy didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Elder Howe of the Violet Cloud race," Pearce said, walking forward. "You're in the Eternal Realm, but you don't seem to have a working brain."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" Howe's voice had been stern and cold before, and now, it sounded even colder.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Violet Cloud race stiffened as well. They didn't think a mere human soul was qualified to speak to a warrior of the Eternal Realm this way.</p>

  <p>Pearce was weaker than Howe, but he was a very sophisticated man. He had experienced everything in his lifetime so far. He said unhurriedly, "In the Source World, the Element Spirit Civilization has attacked our Taiyi Heaven Palace several times, but they failed every single time. The Element Spirit race is our sworn enemy, and we have an irreconcilable hatred for them.</p>

  <p>Your Violet Cloud race is nothing but a mere vassal force of the Element Spirit race. If we surrender now, will you let the Element Spirit race let go of us?"</p>

  <p>The Violet Cloud race had joined the Element Spirit race, but they were not the strongest among the Other Shore races affiliated to the Element Spirit race. They had almost no say in the workings of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Pearce's remark successfully rendered Howe speechless. Howe's face trembled with rage as he roared, "You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>"Courting death? You're a powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm. So it will be easy for you to destroy me, a mere Soul of Light. Am I right?" Pearce retorted.</p>

  <p>Howe suddenly jumped, his tall body doing a flip in the air.</p>

  <p>A wide purple saber in his hand burst out a terrifying force, chopping down towards Pearce's head.</p>

  <p>Pearce didn't budge. He only looked at Howe coldly.</p>

  <p>The saber was just inches away from Pearce's forehead when it stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>It had no effect at all. All the power it contained was erased by the rules in the Sanskrit Light Stage. Any battle on the bronze ground was meaningless.</p>

  <p>Howe knew this but he had still attacked Pearce for two reasons. One was because he was angry, and the other, because he wanted to intimidate the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>He put away his saber before threatening Pearce again, "I hope you will remember never to meet the members of our Violet Cloud race in the second volume. If you do, I will surely tear you into pieces. Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Howe had just turned around to leave with his clansmen, when a voice rang out, "Wait!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly walked out of the crowd.</p>

  <p>The members of the Violet Cloud race turned to look at him rather coldly.</p>

  <p>They knew that even though they had spoken tough to the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, they could do nothing to them. The anger in their hearts had only multiplied, thanks to this. Their gazes were sharp as knives and they looked like they wanted to cut Luo Zheng to pieces.</p>

  <p>"I want to know which of you from the Violet Cloud race will enter the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting," Luo Zheng said, smiling pleasantly. "Please show me mercy when you do."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't really asking them to show mercy. This was simply another way to declare war.</p>

  <p>Howe's eyes lit up at Luo Zheng's words. He had almost forgotten that Luo Zheng could anchor his corporeal body on the Three Purities Stone. And if he could anchor his soul too, he would be able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"Very good! Walden!"</p>

  <p>Walden, a member of the Violet Cloud race, walked out of the group.</p>

  <p>This time, the Violet Cloud race would send six members into the Eternal Scroll Painting. Walden was the strongest of the six. He had ten imprints in all: five Holy Soul Imprints and five Bone Tribulation Imprints. This elevated his status in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Walden's eyes squinted as he smiled and said, "I'll keep it in mind, now that you mention it. I hope you won't disappoint me. Let me show you great mercy."</p>

  <p>Behind him stood the other five members of the Violet Cloud race, radiating unfriendliness. It was obvious that they were taking in everything about Luo Zheng, their common opponent.</p>

  <p>The members of the Three Eyes race were so astonished at what was happening, that they remained frozen in the places.</p>

  <p>"I understand that he once saved your life and that you want to repay him, Egan, but I think we should act within the limits of our abilities," the chief of the Three Eyes race whispered to Egan.</p>

  <p>"I know, Grandpa," Egan said helplessly.</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng must have extraordinary means, but he thought it was unwarranted on Luo Zheng's part to fight against the Violet Cloud race before the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting was opened.</p>

  <p>Egan was more puzzled at the fact that the elders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were doing the same thing as Luo Zheng had done.</p>

  <p>Though his grandfather had reminded him, because he was not ungrateful, he was still willing to give Luo Zheng a hand if his own safety could be assured.</p>
