<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2471 A Glimmer Of Hope </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As far as Harold was concerned, Yan was their best shot of winning in the debate.</p>

  <p>Marsh didn't know the Luo Clan's real background, but since Harold only focused on Yan, he, along with Gibson, paid attention to only Yan too.</p>

  <p>When it came to Zheng, they all thought that the avatar that he had summoned was indeed quite amazing.</p>

  <p>This meant that Zheng had a deep understanding of some kind of Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>But that alone couldn't make up for how much he was lagging behind the others in terms of cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Just like Harold had said, Zheng couldn't even fly on his own. How could he make a record with the help of the flying sword of the Sword Clan?</p>

  <p>Therefore, the three of them hadn't taken Zheng into consideration at all.</p>

  <p>When Yan had marked her name at a height of 920 feet, Harold and the others had all breathed a sigh of relief. They had been sure that Yan would get the inheritance.</p>

  <p>But now, their hope was destroyed!</p>

  <p>Duke had easily broken Yan's record with a set of Energy-extracting Needles.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Gibson asked as he impatiently paced up and down the place.</p>

  <p>If the Dongfang Clan really got their hands on the inheritance in the debate venue, how could the Sword Clan shelter themselves in the future?</p>

  <p>This would have a far-reaching impact on the structure and hierarchy, and even the future, of the divine land.</p>

  <p>They could not accept such a result!</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the inheritance of that powerful man at the Other Shore Realm is. Whatever it is, we can't let the Dongfang Clan directly take control of the Sunrest Tree," Marsh said with a bitter smile. If that happened, it was very likely that the Sword Clan would be expelled from the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>Staring at the cyan stone tablet with a stiff face, Harold said, "There's still hope. There is still a glimmer of hope!"</p>

  <p>In front of the stone tablet, Zheng continued to climb up with the help of the flying sword.</p>

  <p>The young man who had been led all the way here from the universe by Harold had not given up.</p>

  <p>Even if he was only a low-rank True God who couldn't even fly using his own abilities, he was still the seed that Mike had sown.</p>

  <p>He had sprouted and grown into a strong sapling.</p>

  <p>With a little bit of water, he would have grown into a towering tree by now!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zheng hadn't been able to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain according to plan, so he had lost the chance to be watered.</p>

  <p>And yet, here he was, still going. Perhaps he could really perform a miracle.</p>

  <p>"Look, my brother has begun to climb up!" Yan exclaimed, staring up at Zheng. "Come on, brother!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard raised his head as well and saw Zheng accelerate little by little.</p>

  <p>His angry face was filled with strong expectations.</p>

  <p>There was something he knew that Harold and the others didn't.</p>

  <p>When they had gone to kill the Snake Spirit, Reinhard hadn't set the Eye of Perception, so Harold hadn't seen the power of Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>In Reinhard's opinion, it was unbelievable that Zheng had been able to kill a consummate True God with his sword attack.</p>

  <p>How could such an incredible guy only climb up to 700 feet on the cyan stone tablet? Reinhard would never believe it.</p>

  <p>"This pressure is actually formed by the will of the debate." As he stood still on the flying sword, his mind was as calm as water.</p>

  <p>Since he had stopped, everyone thought that he had reached his limit after crossing 700 feet.</p>

  <p>But the truth was, Zheng wanted to figure out the structure of this pressure clearly.</p>

  <p>"However, the Truth of Goodwill and the Truth of Malice are completely mixed together.</p>

  <p>It seems that every kind of Truth of Godly Way has its own use. So what is the use of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice?"</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way was not a kind of theurgy, but a major insight into the chaos.</p>

  <p>In other words, it was more like a foundation.</p>

  <p>Only after a solid foundation had been laid would the boat of truth be condensed and cross the boundless Sea of Truth and reach the shore.</p>

  <p>The foundation of each kind of truth was different.</p>

  <p>For example, Zheng's Truth of Cultivation Nature worked by following the law of everything in nature.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was easy for the Truth of Cultivation Nature to be integrated into the various theurgies and cultivation methods that Zheng practiced.</p>

  <p>But the Truth of Holy Words that Yan practiced was different.</p>

  <p>Unlike the Truth of Cultivation Nature, the Truth of Holy Words couldn't be integrated into other theurgies. Presumably, one needed to cultivate a special theurgy to achieve the effect of the Truth of Holy Words.</p>

  <p>Nobody, not even Zheng, knew what theurgy Yan had cultivated.</p>

  <p>"I will climb using the Truth of Cultivation Nature." Zheng decided, narrowing his eyes.</p>

  <p>So far, he had been climbing up in a straight line, but now, he suddenly floated in a strange arc.</p>

  <p>Then, he began to swing forward and back.</p>

  <p>Although the Truth of Goodwill and the Truth of Malice were mixed well together, there was still a small gap between them.</p>

  <p>The rhythm of Zheng's swinging corresponded to the rhythm of alternation of the Truth of Goodwill and the Truth of Malice.</p>

  <p>"What's Zheng doing?"</p>

  <p>"What an ungraceful posture."</p>

  <p>"He seems to be dancing!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods below had a strange expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng swaying in the air while standing on the flying sword really was a strange scene.</p>

  <p>Yan blinked and pursed her lips. With a faint smile on her face, she said,</p>

  <p>"It seems that my brother has grasped some important knowledge."</p>

  <p>'It's indeed much easier, ' Zheng thought with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Now that he was swinging his body in rhythm with the alternating pressure, the pressure acting against him had been reduced by more than half.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been floating at a height of 700 feet for a long time, but after he began swaying, he reached 800 feet, then 850 feet...</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods watching below gasped in surprise.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng was only a low-rank True God, and he even had to take the help of the Sword Clan's flying sword to fly.</p>

  <p>Achieving a height of 850 feet itself was incredible!</p>

  <p>The skeleton in the deep well stared closely at the picture on the well wall.</p>

  <p>"It took him almost no time to get used to the rhythm of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice!</p>

  <p>He is as smart as his mother.</p>

  <p>I haven't seen such a smart man in a long time. Even in the Source World, he would be considered highly gifted," the skeleton exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"But he won't be able to reach 900 feet with the rhythm alone. He must be taking advantage of the Truth of Cultivation Nature."</p>

  <p>Just as the skeleton thought, after 850 feet, Zheng's swing range and his speed both increased.</p>

  <p>He looked like a phantom that was flashing back and forth.</p>

  <p>"860 feet."</p>

  <p>"870 feet."</p>

  <p>"Oh no! I'm getting faster and faster!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was using the Truth of Cultivation Nature to move along the rhythm of the pressure.</p>

  <p>But although his body could bear the pressure, the flying sword under his feet began to vibrate violently.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Faint cracks appeared on the sword blade.</p>

  <p>If he continued to climb against the pressure, the flying sword would probably be shattered into pieces!</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>There was a sharp look in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Duke, who had overtaken Yan, finally reached his limit.</p>

  <p>He was 940 feet high.</p>

  <p>But just when he was about to carve his name into the stone tablet, he saw Zheng climb up quickly.</p>

  <p>There was determination in Duke's bloodshot eyes.</p>
