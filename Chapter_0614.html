  <p>When they were in the Cloud Road, flying was forbidden. Frank had to use a technique where he pushed his feet off the ground and leapt. But now they were in the Cloud Hall, so Frank flew directly into the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't move backwards anymore as he was stuck in a dead end.</p>

  <p>His face scrunched into a frown as he observed Frank whose body integrated itself with the spear, and fiercely lunged at him. Luo Luo Zheng recognized that it was the technique that killed the Flying Yaksha. It was quite a powerful technique. He had seen Frank use it before.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's body was a spiritual weapon with a strong defensive power, he estimated that his body was still weaker than the Flying Yaksha after it transformed into a golden one. Since the Super Spinning Spear attack had killed the Flying Yaksha, then it could surely kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's impressive that a nature creature could reach such level. But for me, he won't be able to resist this blow from Frank," a Cloud Hall elite said.</p>

  <p>"Of course, he's surely dead this time. It's true that this technique is Frank's secret weapon, but not his most powerful one!" Finlay, who watched the battle on one side, said with a laugh. "If Frank used his Spear of Annihilation, even I would need to be careful while fighting him," he added.</p>

  <p>"This guy has the talent and strength which entitled him to his arrogance, but he is too impatient. I'm afraid he could really sweep all of us away when he enters the Illuminating Soul Realm," another Cloud Hall elite commented as he watched Luo Luo Zheng with mixed feelings. He was quite impressed by Luo Zheng's use of Sword Steps.</p>

  <p>Frank's Super Spinning Spear had almost reached Luo Luo Zheng in the blink of an eye. The fast spinning spear point formed a strong vortex, which looked like it could grind anything that came near it into smithereens.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly rolled his eyes. A purple-black light lit up the tip of his Blood Drinking Sword. It was his demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Luo Zheng slightly turned his wrist, and the Blood Drinking Sword began to turn at the same time as well. The sword drew a perfect circle in the air in a flash, then the demonic life vitality on the sword's tip followed the circle's path. The faster Luo Luo Zheng turned his wrist, the quicker the circle spun. After a short while, an Exterminating Wheel appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Frank also saw the black ring, but thought nothing much of it. His Super Spinning Spear was extremely powerful. It could turn anything that came in its way into ashes. A powerful weapon could beat ten warriors that came at it. No matter how ingenious Luo Zheng's trick was, his game was only a child's play for Frank.</p>

  <p>However, when the tip of Frank's spear poked the black ring, a strong force suddenly pushed him to spin at the circle's speed. His spear's point was now firmly attached to the black ring as well.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>Frank suddenly felt dizzy. He had to maintain a high spinning speed to use his Super Spinning Spear technique. Now, the black ring made his spinning speed many times faster.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall elites that watched the battle also noticed there was something very strange. At the beginning, they thought that Frank intentionally sped up the spinning. In the Super Spinning Spear technique, the faster the spear spun, the more power it could produce.</p>

  <p>But? hadn't Frank spun too fast? The speed was too much that they could barely see Frank's face. He now looked like a dazzling flash of bright light because of his high-speed revolution. His body twisted around like a silver carp in surging water.</p>

  <p>A smile crossed Luo Zheng's face. He already had a clear idea about the properties of the Exterminating Wheel due to his practice in the past few days.</p>

  <p>The first technique of the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death seemed to use the life vitality to form a high-speed spinning life vitality wheel. The spinning life vitality wheel sucked in anything that went into it, and then it shot them out.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't fully understand the theory behind this technique yet because he hadn't completely mastered the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death.</p>

  <p>He was at the very initial stage of the Exterminating Wheel.</p>

  <p>Moreover, before he used this skill, he only assumed that the Exterminating Wheel might suck Frank's spear into it. That was when Luo Luo Zheng decided to give it a try. If the Exterminating Wheel failed to resist Frank's spear, then he would immediately summon Lily and the huge sword of the Blood Fiend Emperor. He would use the huge sword to deflect Frank's attack. However, most of the disciples of the Cloud Hall had seen the huge sword when they were on the Cloud Road. It would certainly cause a spectacle if he used the sword.</p>

  <p>It surprised him that the Exterminating Wheel had worked well. At least Frank didn't look too good now.</p>

  <p>The wind whistled past Frank's ears. He spun and spun more rapidly and he couldn't stop. He now felt very dizzy and couldn't think clearly because the speed was too much. He couldn't even say a word now because of the ultra-high speed of spinning. He could only grasp his white spear to keep him upright.</p>

  <p>Several Cloud Hall elites were also stunned. They didn't have any clue what was happening now.</p>

  <p>Finlay certainly didn't know that the black ring Luo Luo Zheng conjured was the technique in the Blood Fiend Emperor's Malicious Wheel of Life and Death. However, he sensed that Frank was in trouble. "That's enough!</p>

  <p>Let go of Frank!" he shouted coldly.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng turned a deaf ear to Finlay. "He has hands and legs. If he wanted to stop, he could just loosen up his hands and get out of it himself," he sneered.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Zheng's Exterminating Wheel only locked Frank's spear, but not his hands and legs. If Frank dropped his spear, he could get out.</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you to let him go!" Finlay said icily once again. He lifted his bloody red spear and was prepared to fight.</p>

  <p>"Okay. All of you in the Zhuo family are unreasonable. You can't win in a one-on-one fight, so come in groups. Shame on you. Alright, I'll release him." Luo Luo Zheng seethed, then waved his hand to stop the Exterminating Wheel.</p>

  <p>The Exterminating Wheel went into a halt, but Frank still spun crazily fast. The Exterminating Wheel's force had stopped, but the inertia transferred the high-speed spinning into Frank and threw him up to the ceiling. His body hit the ceiling and left a gaping hole in it, then he fell on the ground with a loud thud.</p>
