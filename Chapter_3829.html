<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3829 Complete Erosion </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the creatures present stood still in shock. They had never heard of anyone receiving eighteen imprints since the beginning of history, and the protective light that everyone else obtained wasn't as dense as Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng himself felt that the protective light was too dazzling, and it took him quite a while to get used to it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the others stared blankly at him for a long time, their eyes filled with envy.</p>

  <p>That level of protective light would enable him to easily enter the inner circles and even break through to the third or second circle.</p>

  <p>They all entered the Soul City and passed through the Land of Bone Tribulation, but why was there such a big difference?</p>

  <p>No wonder both the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race fought tooth and nail for Luo Zheng. That was probably the secret reason.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the square was another big hexagram array.</p>

  <p>After everyone had acquired protective light, they gathered in front of the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>From there, they could see the ethereal Void Sand that floated above the ground. "Are we going to rush out together?</p>

  <p>I can take the lead," Luo Zheng offered.</p>

  <p>However, the people behind him had mixed emotions regarding his suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you can't do this," Egan said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Naturally, Luo Zheng was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"The more people are gathered together, the more intense and severe the Void Sand's attacks will be," Kirk answered.</p>

  <p>When the Eternal Scroll Painting was first designed, its designer had considered that some warriors might enter the inner circles in groups. After all, if someone powerful took the lead, then everyone behind him would benefit from it. Furthermore, it would be too easy for the weak ones to enter the inner circles.</p>

  <p>There were a few who had tried to do it before, but when multiple people attempted it, the Void Sand in the vortex gathered like mad and became harder to resist.</p>

  <p>From then on, everyone learned their lesson and entered the big vortex one by one.</p>

  <p>"But this protective light..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that the protective light was quite powerful, but to maintain such a powerful state consumed a lot of energy. Thus, he was afraid that the protective light could only last for a limited time.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Luo Zheng. As long as you stay inside the square, the protective light won't weaken," Egan assured him.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Luo Zheng didn't say anything more. Besides, it wasn't the first time these people entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>They gained their experiences from the many generations before them, so what they said shouldn't be wrong.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go first!" the member of the Life race declared.</p>

  <p>He went forward and stepped on the hexagram array, then transformed into a picture and rushed forth.</p>

  <p>All the eyes of the Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage were on him. The members of the Life race, in particular, even shouted and cheered.</p>

  <p>The last remaining member of the Life race had eight imprints, which included four Holy Soul Imprints and four Bone Tribulation Imprints. The more balanced his corporeal body and soul were, the more even his protective light would be.</p>

  <p>"Lionel will certainly get a good result!"</p>

  <p>"His goal is to enter the seventh circle. He'll surely be able to make it."</p>

  <p>"I believe in Lionel's strength!"</p>

  <p>At that point, the member of the Life race ran wildly in the big vortex.</p>

  <p>As soon as he left the square, the Void Sand began to rush towards him.</p>

  <p>More than a dozen pieces of the Void Sand hit his chest at the same time, but the protective light immediately dissolved them.</p>

  <p>But of course, some of the protective light was dissolved as well.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it wasn't an issue for concern.</p>

  <p>With the protection of the protective light, the outermost circle of the big vortex didn't obstruct him at all. He had already passed through it in only five minutes. Then, he went through the nineteenth circle, the eighteenth circle, the seventeenth circle...</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Grand Plain Stage saw what was happening, but Luo Zheng and the others couldn't. They only saw a golden light dot quickly ran on the ground in the distance.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the member of the Life race had reached the tenth circle.</p>

  <p>Some hexagram arrays were sparsely scattered on the ground outside the tenth circle. Then, behind each hexagram array was a round room.</p>

  <p>If this member of the Life race wanted to obtain a bloodline, he could choose a hexagram array and enter the room behind it.</p>

  <p>However, this member of the Life race named Lionel had long aimed for the seventh circle and did not intend to compromise.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the ninth circle, a large amount of Void Sand hit him.</p>

  <p>The Void Sand eroded his protective light up to the point that its golden glow was fading at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>"It seems that Lionel's protective light is quite weak!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it truly is difficult to maintain the protective light until he reaches the seventh circle."</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>The Life race was a race that had gone through all kinds of hardships.</p>

  <p>Although they were under the Element Spirit race's protection, they were weak and undervalued. The other races always abused them, and until now, only their leader was at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>As Lionel grew up, he swore to himself that he would become a mighty warrior of the Eternal Realm, and explore Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore to revive their Life race.</p>

  <p>Because of his great ambition, he had worked hard.</p>

  <p>"The eighth circle!"</p>

  <p>Once he entered the eighth ring, the protective light on his body became very weak.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, the eighth circle should be his destination at that point.</p>

  <p>However, he refused to stop there. Since he decided that he would enter the seventh circle, then he wouldn't give up until he made it. The deeper he went, the stronger the bloodline he would get. Thus, he convinced himself that he had to do his best and reach his limit.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't even do that, then how could he revive his race?</p>

  <p>When he was halfway through the eighth circle, however, his protective light completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Without the protective light, things would get very complicated and dangerous for him.</p>

  <p>"Lionel, please choose a bloodline already!"</p>

  <p>"Your protective light is gone!" the other members of the Life race shouted repeatedly, but they couldn't transmit their voices from the Grand Plain Stage to the Eternal Scroll Painting. Besides, based on Lionel's mentality, he wouldn't stop even if he heard them.</p>

  <p>The Void Sand hit his arms, chest, belly, and legs, and left countless sand-sized pits. The intense pain was like thousands of needles that stabbed into his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>If he had a weaker will, then he would've passed out from the pain by now.</p>

  <p>He continued to rush forward with gritted teeth as his arms covered his face.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached the seventh circle, the Void Sand had eroded more than half of the arm that covered his face. The bones inside it broke, then his arm completely fell off his shoulder.</p>

  <p>His legs were also damaged, so he could only limp forward.</p>

  <p>The members of the Life race kept shouting in the Grand Plain Stage. They saw that his picture in the Eternal Scroll Painting became increasingly smaller until it almost stumbled forward on the ground.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Lionel still managed to crawl into the seventh circle. As soon as he entered it, however, a swarm of Void Sand submerged him, and he disappeared into the depths of the great vortex. The Void Sand had devoured and eroded every tissue of his body.</p>
