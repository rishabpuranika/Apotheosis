<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2289 Being Defeated </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned for a moment. After he had regained his composure, he smiled faintly and said, "Don't be absurd. You won't die."</p>

  <p>"I am telling you the truth!"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu snapped angrily. She pounced on Luo Luo Zheng and grabbed him tightly by the collar, her eyes burning with rage.</p>

  <p>An explosive power generated from her, and it hit him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback by the magnitude of that explosion. He landed on the ground, on his back. Han Liusu landed on top of him. They gazed into each other's eyes.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu couldn't make out Luo Zheng's expression due to the mist covering his face. She heard his muffled laughter though. "Don't you dare laugh at me! My strength and talent are no worse than Nelly's," she stated.</p>

  <p>Those who were able to rank among the top ten in the Arena of Legends often had their own unique talents.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Ling Shuang had a dual Godly Tile and had the token beyond way which was specially designed for her by Murphy. Han Liusu, on the other hand, was the possessor of a special preternatural flame.</p>

  <p>As if boasting about her strength, Han Liusu jumped into air, and the air around her became dry. Streaks of bright blue flames began to dance on her left hand.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the flames condensed into a blue spear which was directed towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Stand up, Luo Luo Zheng! Use your strength to the fullest!" Han Liusu ordered in an assertive voice.</p>

  <p>She had been defeated by Ling Shuang in the past, as the latter possessed the Avenging Body. If it weren't for the Avenging Body, it would have been a daunting task for Ling Shuang to fight against Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>When Han Liusu was finally able to find a way to counter Nelly's Avenging Body, Ling Shuang never accepted her challenge, much to her annoyance. Had she accepted Liusu's challenge, she might have had to give Han Liusu the first place in the Hall of True Gods of the low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground, Luo Luo Zheng looked at the spear that Han Liusu had conjured.</p>

  <p>A sharp Mu Ning emitted from the tip of the spear. It seemed as if the spear had the ability to penetrate everything.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had indeed made great progress. She had become much stronger than Luo Luo Zheng had expected her to be. Her being ranked among the top three people in the Hall of True Gods justified her strength.</p>

  <p>'I don't want her to get involved. It's quite dangerous, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He was able to see much more clearly after entering the Floating Island of the Han Clan. He was also able to see his enemies who were able to conceive themselves from him.</p>

  <p>The wealthy clans on the Floating Islands were so powerful and influential that people felt intimidated by their status. If someone considered any of the clans as their opponent, they made life miserable for them. Fortunately for Luo Luo Zheng, he knew what it was like to have them as his rivals.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he didn't want to get Han Liusu involved in all this mess.</p>

  <p>'Well, it might not be a bad idea after all to tell her about the dangerous situation, ' he thought to himself, his eyes landing on Liusu's earnest face.</p>

  <p>He quickly got up on his feet with a whoosh.</p>

  <p>He rushed towards her with great speed.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu watched Luo Luo Zheng coming as she rolled the spear in her hand. There was a piercing sound as the spear began to spin rapidly. At the same time, a beam of blue light appeared from the spear and shot towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The spear radiance is so sharp!"</p>

  <p>As the spear radiance made its way towards Luo Luo Zheng, his heart skipped a beat. The Buddha Emperor Sword and the Grant Sun Sword started to form in front of him.</p>

  <p>Then, a loud clapping sound was heard.</p>

  <p>The thin blue spear radiance collided with the Buddha Emperor Sword, and the power that was stored in it instantly exploded, forming a beautiful yet desolate spear flower. Then, the Buddha Emperor Sword gave way.</p>

  <p>As the spear flower bloomed, another thin blue spear radiance emerged from it and headed straight towards the Grant Sun Sword.</p>

  <p>The clap-like sound was heard again.</p>

  <p>The Grant Sun Sword was the thickest sword in the Gods Killing Sword Array. It was used to protect its owner.</p>

  <p>But the spear radiance which arose from the Buddha Emperor Sword, exploded again on the Grant Sun Sword. Thus, the Grant Sun Sword was crushed. Another blue spear flower emerged from the spear radiance and shot towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'The spear radiance is quite powerful!' he thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was fully prepared when the spear appeared in Liusu's hand, although he didn't expect it to be so powerful.</p>

  <p>He knew that he had underestimated her.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, he twisted his body and tried to avoid the spear radiance, but his efforts were in vain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng watched in dismay.</p>

  <p>The spear radiance didn't meet any resistance. It went through Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>He then felt a white light flash in his mind as he returned to his own room. He had tasted defeat for the very first time, and against the likes of Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had worked quite hard in order to accumulate a great deal of points from thirty-three matches, but all the hard work was nullified, and the hard-earned points were lost to Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that I have lost," he said smiling bitterly.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect to be defeated by Han Liusu in just a single move. He knew that she relied a lot on the eerie blue fire in order to secure third position in the Hall of True Gods. But he underestimated her. She had burnt him with that fire before, but it didn't cause him any harm. He wasn't aware until now that she could use it to such extent.</p>

  <p>The last spear attack launched by Han Liusu was indeed the strongest one that Luo Luo Zheng had ever encountered. The spear radiance pierced through two of his swords easily and was still able to pierce through his head after three consecutive cycles of reflection. He knew that this attack of Liusu's was unavoidable, be it Ling Shuang or any other low-rank True God in the Hall of True Gods, and she secured the third position in the Hall of True Gods because of her real strength, and not just because of the power of fire.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu finally returned to her room. She felt a little bit better after defeating Luo Luo Zheng. Yet she still was visibly upset by what happened earlier between the pair. As the elder princess of the Han Clan, she told Luo Luo Zheng her intention of eloping with him, but he refused. She never forgave him for rejecting her so casually.</p>

  <p>She pushed open the door of her own room and rushed down the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>After Liusu's triumphant victory over Luo Luo Zheng, she was ranked first in the Hall of True Gods. He was fourth behind Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu quickly made her way towards Luo Zheng's room and pounded on the door, but she got no response. Giving up, she finally made her way back to her room and left the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>She ignored the queer expression on many people's faces as she passed them by in the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Han Liusu won the battle against the anonymous man!"</p>

  <p>"I've told you, the anonymous man is from the Han Clan. He let Han Liusu win. This way, no one would know his identity and he would never be exposed."</p>

  <p>"You think so? If the Dongfang Clan really makes a move, the Han Clan could do nothing to protect the anonymous man."</p>

  <p>The first defeat of the anonymous man got everyone talking and speculating. People had their doubts regarding the anonymous man belonging to the Han Clan. Now, it was all confirmed.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had almost acquired two million points by defeating Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the rankings of the Floating Islands, the Han Clan was likely to have an advantage.</p>

  <p>In Joy's palace, she watched the Jade Wall of Legends emit some faint light as she saw two figures emerging from it. Joy said to Luo Luo Zheng, "So you have lost your points?"</p>

  <p>Before she could finish her sentence, Han Liusu shouted in rage, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng backed off a few steps.</p>

  <p>"I have already proved my strength, haven't I?" she said in a fit of rage.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gave a weak smile and said, "I lost to you accidentally."</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't this the worst excuse of all times? If we were not in the ring, you would have died. And you wouldn't be standing here right now," she stated angrily.</p>

  <p>Joy had no idea what on earth was going on between the two.</p>

  <p>'Wasn't Luo Luo Zheng supposed to lose to Han Liusu?' she thought. She knew nothing of the spat between the two in the Arena of Legends.</p>
