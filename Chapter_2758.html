<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2758 Plan To Kill Zheng </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The black eyes continued to stare at Zheng, as the man tried to gauge some clues from him.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng suddenly raised his long sword.</p>

  <p>He was about to implement a simple yet powerful sword skill.</p>

  <p>"The Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng's understanding of the Emotion Closing Godly Way deepened, other different skills that he had combined in the swordsmanship also increased.</p>

  <p>Powerful force, Ways-blending Energy, and more pure killing move were some of the skills that he had infused.</p>

  <p>But the Gods-intimidating Strike continued to be the foundation of his sword skills.</p>

  <p>At first, the man that was hiding in the black water looked mildly perplexed looking at Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, his eyes lit up after seeing the Gods-intimidating Strike. It seemed like all his doubts cleared up.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The more Zheng merged the Godly Ways perfectly, the more powerful the Ways-blending Energy became.</p>

  <p>As Zheng slashed his sword, there arose a faint ray of radiance that began to spread out.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Mathew had every intention to kill Zheng with his Golden Destruction Strike. He was determined to hack him into pieces this time.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful consummate True Gods were, they too had limited abilities. Mathew didn't expect that Zheng would be able to resist his sword strike.</p>

  <p>However, when the two rays of sword radiance clashed with each other, Mathew's confidence wavered a bit.</p>

  <p>Zheng was in no way an ordinary warrior at consummation of True God Realm. If Mathew, a top-level Demi-holy Being, was defeated by Zheng, he would be thoroughly humiliated.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>The two rays of sword radiance collided with such force that an ear piercing sound was created, enough to tear open one's eardrums.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the point where the swords collided, red golden light spots appeared.</p>

  <p>These light spots were shooting in all directions at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>Some light spots fell on Jayden's body, leaving behind some nasty wounds.</p>

  <p>Unable to withstand the violent shooting, Jayden gave up the idea of trapping Zheng with his snake spear and started to retreat.</p>

  <p>'Mathew's Golden Destruction Strike should be more than enough to kill Zheng, ' he thought as he stepped back.</p>

  <p>However, Mathew was finding it difficult to be so optimistic.</p>

  <p>He stared at the golden and white sword radiance with a grim look on his face. It was going to be a tough challenge to bring down Zheng.</p>

  <p>Earlier, his Golden Destruction Strike had the upper hand. In the blink of an eye, it had swallowed one third of the white sword radiance.</p>

  <p>However, halfway through the swallowing, the Golden Destruction Strike suddenly started to shrink in size. And the Gods-intimidating Strike that Zheng had slashed out was getting vicious by the minute.</p>

  <p>"Golden Destruction Strike is a unique skill of the Demi-holy Being of the Mu Clan. It is hard to overcome such a strong skill. In the divine land, however, what can be a match for the sword skill produced by the Emotion Closing Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>The pair of eyes in the black water continued to watch the scene above the surface. Seeing the two rays of sword radiance intertwine with each other, the man had already made a decision.</p>

  <p>And sure enough, in the blink of an eye, the sword radiance of the Golden Destruction Strike suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>While the white sword radiance of the Gods-intimidating Strike went straight to Mathew.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Mathew snorted coldly. He reluctantly admitted that he was inferior to Zheng in such a fight.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he swung the Invisible Incantation Sword once again.</p>

  <p>The Golden Destruction Strike was one of Mathew's most powerful moves.</p>

  <p>But it consumed a lot of internal momentum. Even as a Demi-holy Being, he could at most perform only three strikes in a row. If he forced his cinnabar field to release more strikes, he would rapidly lose the internal momentum in his body. Thereby, it would need his life vitality to make up for it, which would in turn damage the foundation of his inner world.</p>

  <p>'But my second strike should definitely kill him. After all, he is only a consummate True God. I am sure the strike he just made was his last attempt. It's impossible for him to make a second strike. No matter how talented he is, he can't escape death after all!' Mathew thought with amusement.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The second Golden Destruction Strike shot out.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the sword radiance materialized, Mathew's expression froze.</p>

  <p>He just couldn't believe what was happening in front of him.</p>

  <p>"What the hell? No way this could be happening!"</p>

  <p>Zheng swung his Shadow Bearing Sword directly at Mathew.</p>

  <p>Streaks of white sword radiance formed strands of silk threads as they floated in the air. They soon formed a complicated angle and slashed at Mathew.</p>

  <p>In a lightning speed, Zheng had produced seven or eight strikes.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Mathew's face twitched again, as a thought occurred to him.</p>

  <p>Was this fellow really a consummate True God and not a Holy Being?</p>

  <p>Zheng had not left his name on the Mountain of Holy Beings, or else Mathew would have doubted that he was a Holy Being's disguise.</p>

  <p>However, this question flashed through his mind only for a second. Now, he was furiously retreating back.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>The sword radiance had already swallowed his Golden Destruction Strike.</p>

  <p>And he was about to be drowned by Zheng's strikes.</p>

  <p>Jayden, who stood not far away, put one hand on Mathew's shoulder and a snake spear flew out.</p>

  <p>Every time the snake spear hit the air, a huge whirlpool would appear.</p>

  <p>Jayden repeated the strike more than ten times, and soon a dozen huge whirlpools appeared between Zheng and them.</p>

  <p>Swirling at high speed, the whirlpools dispersed Zheng's sword radiance across all directions.</p>

  <p>Somehow, he successfully stopped Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had been determined to give his all in the fight and had no intention to spare the two Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>As he narrowed his eyes, thunder wings appeared on his back. As the wings flapped furiously, he rushed towards the two Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>On the Desperation Plain</p>

  <p>Samuel bowed to Nicholas in the distance and said through his life vitality,</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, my son and daughters are in trouble. I have to go save them."</p>

  <p>With these words, he flew to the left side of the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>Nicholas continued to fight fiercely against Gallio.</p>

  <p>So far, he had the upper hand, with the help from Murphy and Clark.</p>

  <p>But the fiend's recovery was so remarkable that it soon became a seesaw battle.</p>

  <p>Nicholas wanted to keep Samuel at the Desperation Plain, but Samuel had every right to save his children, so he couldn't stop him from leaving.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>After rushing out of the Desperation Plain, Samuel turned into a cyan light and rapidly flew towards the black water.</p>

  <p>Pascal started to retreat, but did not run away. Samuel could find Zheng quickly with Pascal's help.</p>

  <p>He couldn't let out the secret of his identity.</p>

  <p>Once Nicholas knew about it, it would be a catastrophe.</p>

  <p>The safest way out was to kill Zheng as fast as possible. That was why he quickly left the Desperation Plain, regardless of Nicholas' suspicion.</p>

  <p>"If I were the leader of the union of powerful clans on the Floating Islands, I would surely treasure a talent like you. But it's a pity that I am not the leader and you already know too much!"</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes were full of killing intent.</p>

  <p>He personally did not despise Zheng. Furthermore, Zheng's performance was outstanding. If Zheng joined the Han Clan, he would certainly be put in an important position.</p>

  <p>Now in order to make sure nothing would go wrong, Samuel had no option but to kill Zheng.</p>
