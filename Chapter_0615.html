<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 615 Spear Of Annihilation (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Watching the scenes unfold before them, the elite disciples of Cloud Hall were struck dumb, unable to get a word out.</p>

  <p>Most of them were at level four, five, or six of the Illuminating Soul Realm, a little higher than Frank. But if they really fought Frank out in battle, none could defeat him, for he was a heaven-level talent. He was far stronger than he looked and often fought warriors at higher levels with little difficulty.</p>

  <p>But now, Frank had been challenged by a disciple of a lower level.</p>

  <p>The elites could not wrap their minds around the fact that the boy was only at grade four of the nature level.</p>

  <p>Frank was a beginner at the Illuminating Soul Realm. He could easily make dead meat of a disciple at grade four or five. The elites would have found it acceptable if both sides were at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Not to forget, Frank had an array of unusual talents and resources under his belt. His father had made sure he had been carefully cultivated. His one meal would probably cost many other warriors everything they owned. How could any of them compare to that?</p>

  <p>But then what about Luo Luo Zheng? It was a profound gap between grade four of the nature level and initial stage of the Illuminating Soul Realm. The other disciples found it incredible that the young boy, still wet behind the ears, had challenged a practiced disciple. Everyone was all too aware of the marked difference between them.</p>

  <p>But now, they couldn't help but realize why Luo Luo Zheng had been so arrogant before. He was strong enough to challenge even Frank.</p>

  <p>As the other elite disciples stood looking shocked at what was happening, Frank emerged out of the hole. At the moment, his hair was disheveled, his eyes blazing red with fury. His current appearance strayed from his usual look of cold elegance.</p>

  <p>Frank looked unhinged, like an enraged animal. His gaze stared daggers at Luo Luo Zheng. "Luo Luo Zheng!" he called out hoarsely. "I don't care who is backing you.</p>

  <p>You must be killed!"</p>

  <p>Previously, Frank hadn't planned on killing Luo Luo Zheng. That day after Frank's father heard someone's voice message in his ears, he instantly left without a word. It was surmised that the voice message came from a senior of the Cloud Hall. It might even have been Cloud Hall's head herself.</p>

  <p>Frank hadn't wanted to put Luo Luo Zheng to death at first when he decided to fight him.</p>

  <p>But now he raged uncontrollably. Any sense of rationality and wisdom had vanished like ice in hot weather. Bits of gray death Mu Ning hovered over his body, as if belonging to a man who had been dead since a long time ago.</p>

  <p>The dragon texture appeared over his white spear, blood-red light glittering inch-by-inch on it. Once the red illuminated starkly, it started to turn dark. As it did so, a black dragon texture materialized, replacing the previous red one. It had a clear and strong death Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Frank, do you mean to use your killing skill?" Finlay asked, his face turning pale. He hadn't expected this, for Luo Luo Zheng was at such a low level compared to Frank.</p>

  <p>Hearing Finlay, the other elite disciples, too, lost color on their faces.</p>

  <p>The skill was the Spear of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Most of them had heard about this skill, as it was Emanuel's unique talent. Emanuel had become famous for it.</p>

  <p>It was said that only a warrior with an innate talent for communicating with the ghostdom could practice the skill of the Spear of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Ghostdom was something that was supposed to be indecipherable to the warriors of this world. The records mentioning it in secret books and legends did not go into much detail either.</p>

  <p>There were only two people who had this talent and they were Emanuel Zhuo and Frank Zhuo. It was the exact reason why Emanuel cherished Frank so much, even though Emanuel had so many other heirs. Frank had the same special ability as him. In fact, Frank might even surpass his father once his full potential was developed.</p>

  <p>Death Mu Ning radiated from Frank's body, flying undisguised around his white spear. Engulfed in it, Frank was a figure of terror.</p>

  <p>Tia and Morphens stood inside the ice palace at the top of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>They stared at the Picture Slab without blinking.</p>

  <p>"Frank is about to use his skill of Spear of Annihilation. He cannot yet wield it fully, but it is still powerful enough. I'm afraid Luo Luo Zheng cannot survive it," Morphens said. As per Morphens, Luo Luo Zheng would find it unable to bear Frank's Spear of Annihilation. Just as its name suggested, the skill demanded absolute annihilation. Frank had suffered a heavy hit by Luo Luo Zheng just moments ago. He would surely spare no effort in using this skill.</p>

  <p>An icy fog hazed Tia's vision, her eyes looking momentarily surprised.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Let's see how Luo Luo Zheng fights it. I think he can do it. The power of the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death is not weaker than that of the Spear of Annihilation."</p>

  <p>Tia was familiar with the Spear of Annihilation. Before going to the trial, Tia had been attentive of Frank's Spear of Annihilation and had planned to ask him to break the enchanted barrier. But later, she chose Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this was how it was meant to be.</p>

  <p>How powerful was the Blood Fiend Emperor? Since he had chosen the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death as his main cultivation method, how could its power not compare to that of the Spear of Annihilation? Even though Luo Luo Zheng had practiced the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death for only a short period of time, Tia was still confident in him. More importantly, this would be a great test for him.</p>

  <p>Although Morphens had heard that Tia could obtain the inheritance of the Blood Fiend Emperor with Luo Zheng's help, he still doubted Luo Zheng's power.</p>

  <p>Like most other warriors, he thought Luo Zheng's cultivation level too low.</p>

  <p>Tia seemed not to worry about Luo Luo Zheng in this situation. Morphens didn't say anything more, choosing to gaze at the Picture Slab instead.</p>
