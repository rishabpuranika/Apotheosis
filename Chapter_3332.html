  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was known that without certain things like the Soul Binding Thread, it was difficult to kill the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the Souls of Light who threatened Luo Zheng weren't anyone truly important, so he naturally didn't bother to waste his time on dealing with them. He had more important things to do.</p>

  <p>After the Souls of Light disappeared, Feng Ge came out of the Dark Region with Dorothy in tow. Then, the three of them walked towards the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race were almost finished with all the preparation work in front of the Grand Sky Temple. Today, they would open the temple if everything went according to the plan.</p>

  <p>However, the most recent thing that had just happened was a shock to all the members of various races. The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, Jin Wu, and Divine Farmer race all had left. Only the Souls of Light from some small races decided to stay and watch what would happen next.</p>

  <p>"These people escaped fast," Luo Zheng said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had walked around the Grand Sky Temple once, he asked Dorothy and Feng Ge to wait for a while. He wanted to return to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light. When the two ladies had settled down, his physical body disappeared from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Where is Luo Zheng? Is he gone?" Feng Ge asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked at Feng Ge helplessly and replied, "He has left the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>"Left the Other Shore?" Feng Ge thought for a while and seemed to understand what had happened. "Will he come back then?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he will," Dorothy said firmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body and soul were separated on the Other Shore. Sometimes, he needed to switch between the two forms.</p>

  <p>Before he had entered the Grand Sky Temple, he had left his Soul of Light at the Grand Sky Temple's entrance. Right now, he was probably planning to return to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he had finally gotten out of the Other Shore. His eyelids fluttered slightly before fully opening, after which he saw a scene in the room on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Not far away was Dorothy who sat with her legs crossed, and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Sadness hung like a thick cloud over Xi Youqin and Yudie, who stood in the corner of the room. Yudie in particular looked much thinner than before, as they had been worrying about Luo Zheng every day and night.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but feel the stab of pain in his heart as he watched them quietly.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he already came out of the Dark Region and would return soon.</p>

  <p>He couldn't let Dorothy and Feng Ge wait too long now.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng thought of it, he activated the Truth of Divine Dao and returned to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Yudie mumbled.</p>

  <p>She felt the truth aura that emanated from Luo Zheng, but it was quite faint.</p>

  <p>A soft sigh escaped her lips as she gazed at her husband's closed eyes.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had entered the Other Shore in the form of Soul of Light, the three of them moved forward on the right side of the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>They needed to go back to the other side of the Other Shore to find a way to remove the Soul Binding Thread that was wrapped around Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Halfway through their journey, the three of them had reached the narrowest area of the Light Region on the Other Shore. The areas at the two sides of the road belonged to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Luo Zheng blurted out as he walked towards the edge of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was able to freely enter and exit the Dark Region, but Dorothy was still a little scared when she saw the place.</p>

  <p>"There is one Other Shore Token that I need to merge with in the Dark Region," Luo Zheng told Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Something flashed in Dorothy's eyes. "What Other Shore Token needs to be merged with in the Dark Region?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Something from the Dark Region, of course," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"An Other Shore Token from the Dark Region?!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy didn't know much about the Dark Region. When Luo Zheng was trapped in the Dark Region, she had done a lot of research about it using various materials.</p>

  <p>The materials were highly detailed, and they mentioned something about the Other Shore Tokens in the Dark Region. The Other Shore Tokens there possessed strong Other Shore Power, but it was very difficult to merge with them because everything in the Dark Region clashed with the Light Region.</p>

  <p>In history, a small number of people had obtained Other Shore Tokens of the Dark Region. The process of merging with them had always remained a secret.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I will use candles," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Candles?" Dorothy was surprised. She didn't expect that those candles would have such use.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng knew that Dorothy held a lot of doubts in her mind. He didn't intend to conceal anything from her though, so he said, "I'll tell you everything after we leave the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Then, he asked Feng Ge to take out a candle and light it up with the divine flames of the Jin Wu. After that, he took the candle and walked towards the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The road in the middle that separated the Dark Region into two parts was the only path that connected the two ends of Stage Thirteen. There were a lot of Souls of Light that came and passed by on the road, and Luo Zheng's actions immediately caught many of their attentions.</p>

  <p>"Look, there are three humans over there. What are they doing?"</p>

  <p>"That human has lit up a candle!"</p>

  <p>"Is he taking a candle to walk to the Dark Region?"</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light who were watching the scene were all dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>They all thought that the Dark Region was an absolutely forbidden area, and merely going near it would completely destroy the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Therefore, what Luo Zheng was doing was the same as looking for death.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Zheng really walked into the darkness with his candle just like that.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the candle had illuminated the endless darkness.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light who watched him were stunned. They couldn't believe their eyes, and they didn't understand what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Let's go there and take a look!"</p>

  <p>"These humans are really capable. Go and ask them how they did it!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before more and more Souls of Light gathered around, until they were too many to count. After all, they naturally wanted to find out the secrets that had made such a bizarre thing to happen.</p>

  <p>Some of them began to have greedy thoughts. They thought that if it was necessary, it was also a good choice to directly attack them.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had entered the Dark Region, he told Feng Ge to keep guard and prevent any other Souls of Light from going near.</p>

  <p>Thus, Feng Ge scowled at the sight of those Souls of Light who were approaching them. "If you dare come closer, don't blame me when I attack," she hissed.</p>

  <p>As soon as her voice rang out, she forcefully stomped her foot down and the ground beneath her immediately sank.</p>

  <p>Only then did the Souls of Light clearly see what this human woman was capable of. And they could see her face and features clearly!</p>

  <p>Was she? a creature on the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>But she was clearly a human!</p>

  <p>Rumor had it from Stage Thirteen that someone had entered the Other Shore with a physical body. That body, however, was clearly in the shape of a human man, and the man wasn't a creature of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>What was going on with this human girl?</p>

  <p>Then again, no matter what might be the case, the Souls of Light didn't dare to go forward.</p>

  <p>Judging from the power that she had just unleashed, it seemed that it was easy for her to kill them.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Souls of Light just retreated and watched them from afar instead.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng had successfully entered the Dark Region. His eyes cautiously scanned his new surroundings.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Dark Region were afraid of the Light Region, and had no desire to approach it. Fortunately, the edges of the area were already desolate, so he didn't need to worry about being attacked by the creatures of the Dark Region. Even if he did get attacked, he still could escape to the Light Region with the candle.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had placed the candle on the ground and got ready, he asked Feng Ge to hand over the Civilization Artifact to him.</p>

  <p>It was important for him to remember that the Green Jade Spirit had also warned him to prevent exposing the Civilization Artifact to the Light Region.</p>

  <p>Even if the Civilization Artifact was extremely solid, it would still be hard for it to withstand the light from the Light Region because the light could extinguish it in a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the light of the candle could also corrode the Civilization Artifact, but the candlelight's energy wasn't that strong, so the Civilization Artifact could still withstand it.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had taken over the Civilization Artifact, his Soul of Light activated the Truth of Cultivation Nature, then slowly fused the Civilization Artifact with his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Before, he was a little worried and afraid that the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Civilization Artifact would clash with each other. Now that he was proven wrong and the Civilization Artifact was successfully fused into his body, he realized that his anxiety was totally unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Yet, merging with it was only the first step. The next step was to make his inner world carry the Civilization Artifact, and only then would he be considered to have truly possessed this Other Shore Token.</p>
