<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 101 Transformation Into The Spiritual Weapon (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew how mysterious weapons differed from spiritual weapons.</p>

  <p>During the blooded test, he suffered horrific injuries from the dagger, which was one of spiritual weapons that Ryan used. Ryan would have defeated Luo Zheng if it wasn't for his body possessing the might of a top grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng's body evolved into a spiritual weapon, his strengths would be naturally and significantly enhanced regardless of what he was capable of withstanding.</p>

  <p>That brought the most critical point to Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"The most remarkable difference between spiritual and mysterious weapons isn't in their tenacity or sharpness. Instead, each spiritual weapon has a unique, extraordinary skill of its own. Like, Ryan's had a mighty silk energy thread he could summon," murmured Luo Zheng to the empty cavern.</p>

  <p>"Since my body has been upgraded now to the equivalent spiritual weapon, I wonder what kind of 'skill' I will gain?" Wondering about the possibilities excited Luo Zheng even more.</p>

  <p>"Now, how do I trigger the skill of the spiritual weapon though?' reflected Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Standing on the solid lake, Luo Zheng extended one hand out, breathed in and out, and loudly shouted, "Hai!" Rushing ahead two steps, he raised one leg, spinning in the air as he did, executing a spinning kick.</p>

  <p>As he went through the motions, Zheng's moves looked awkward.</p>

  <p>After some trials and erroneous moves, Luo Zheng stood still, scratched his head and chuckled, thinking he was behaving idiotically.</p>

  <p>Since he didn't even know if he had a spiritual weapon skill, it was impossible for him to test it the way he was.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stopped performing the senseless actions, the gold foil covering his body suddenly vanished from sight, leaving the cave in darkness all over again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pulled a fire starter out of his space ring. As he rubbed it, the cave lit up.</p>

  <p>He looked around and saw nothing but the corpses of the queen blade locust and fire scorpion lion.</p>

  <p>Earlier, when he jumped into the lake of lava, he had wondered whether or not the two massive beasts would battle each other.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng felt he was overthinking everything. These wild creatures were more ferocious than he had imagined, and Luo Zheng couldn't help shaking his head and sighing at the miserable, wasted deaths of these two creatures.</p>

  <p>As he headed in the direction of an exit and after he took two steps, he smacked himself in the forehead, thinking his brain was addled from the burning in the lake.</p>

  <p>If the crystal cores from ordinary blade locusts and blade locust officers could be exchanged for some points, then, couldn't the crystal core from within the queen blade locust be exchanged for an even greater sum of points?</p>

  <p>It would be such a waste to leave the queen blade locust's crystal core there.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng thought, his heart raced. Tiptoeing to the queen blade locust, Luo Zheng took his knife out of the space ring and thrust it into her chest.</p>

  <p>"Clank! Tink!" came the melodious sound of a fist-sized purple crystal core hitting stone as it tumbled out of the locust and clattered to the ground.</p>

  <p>"The crystal core of the blade locust officer is only as big as a walnut, but the queen's crystal core is as large as a man's fist!" exclaimed Luo Zheng while he tucked the purple crystal core into his space ring.</p>

  <p>After that, he turned his focus to the fire scorpion lion's corpse.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know if a fire scorpion lion's crystal core could be exchanged for points. He did know how rare the lion's crystal core was, and that it was the most valuable treasure among pill refiners and weapon refiners.</p>

  <p>Without analyzing it further, Luo Zheng cut the corpse of the fire scorpion lion with his knife and dug out the crystal core.</p>

  <p>Treasures could be found over the entire body of a supernatural beast.</p>

  <p>Human beings could become even mightier than supernatural monsters if they took advantage of these treasures. Luo Zheng wanted to make use of the fire scorpion lion's tail, so, with his broken knife, he sliced it off.</p>

  <p>Wanting to take back the queen's blade, Luo Zheng checked his space ring, trying to make it fit, but there wasn't enough space to hold it, so he gave up. He could have carried it, but since the blade locusts had a keener sense of smell than human beings, if Luo Zheng had it on him, he would be attacked by any blade locust he encountered.</p>

  <p>After taking what booty he could take, Luo Zheng walked back through the cave in the direction he had entered it.</p>

  <p>He retraced his steps because of how unusual the cave was. With one shocking beast like fire scorpion lion inside, Luo Zheng thought the chances were greater of encountering more terrifying creatures further in the cave.</p>

  <p>In light of surviving the attack from the queen blade locust and coming face to face with the fire scorpion lion, he attributed mainly to his good luck, realizing he would have had no chance of survival if not for being able to withstand the lake of lava and the earth's core fire within it.</p>

  <p>Rushing back through the caves, Luo Zheng wasn't paying close attention and didn't know if he had gone in the right direction for a minute.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Luo Zheng took a few wrong turns and met some class three beasts. He had some great adventures, as well as near misses, and several hours later, he emerged from the cave.</p>

  <p>By the time he got back up to the world outside the cave, night had fallen, and it was dark. The sky sparkled brilliantly with millions of stars.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng realized as he looked up how late it must be.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng carefully made his way back across the canyon and jungles, running along the paths he had followed during the daylight in the direction of the Dragon Fort.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, blade locusts spent their night in ensconcing in their lairs, only venturing out under the rarest of unusual situations because they weren't nocturnal by nature. Any other beasts that would normally be out hunting at night were driven away by the insect aggression. Therefore, Luo Zheng didn't run into any beasts as he made his way through the thick jungles.</p>

  <p>It took him a long time, but, finally, the Dragon Fort came into his view.</p>

  <p>Once he reached the Dragon Fort, Luo Zheng strode to the building where Martin lived.</p>

  <p>Martin was housed with other members of the Green Haze group in the barracks. Luo Zheng saw two guards stationed outside the barracks as he approached the building.</p>

  <p>When the guards saw Luo Zheng, they immediately raised their lances, shouting, "Halt! Who goes? This is the barrack of the Green Haze Group! No visitors are welcome late at night. Leave immediately!"</p>
