<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng did not pursue the topic about the plain's magic ability. He went to the entrance, which was two rows of fences, with the others.</p>

  <p>The fences seemed to have existed for a long time as they looked utterly decayed.</p>

  <p>There were exquisite carvings on the surface of the fences, and they were rotten as well.</p>

  <p>Upon closer look, Zheng noticed that there was a complete carving on top of a post, but a film of dust covered a part of it. Just as he was about to brush it off, Fuxi looked at him in horror and said, "Zheng, don't touch this fence!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's fingers stopped one inch before the fence and he asked, "Why?"</p>

  <p>"There's something ominous about the fences. Anyone who touches them can't get out of the Whining Road," Fuxi said with certainty.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised one brow. "Is that so?"</p>

  <p id="top_8">He didn't believe Fuxi, but everything was possible on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, the fences did have something to do with the Whining Road.</p>

  <p>In the end, he did not touch the fence. At that moment, the Heavenly Eye Vine extended a thin branch and gently touched his forehead, then passed its thoughts to him. "I... I've already sent you here. Can I leave now?" it said.</p>

  <p>Zheng had forced the Heavenly Eye Vine to come with them, and its life source was still in his hands.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the Heavenly Eye Vine's large pupil and said, "As far as I know, you can only go through the Silent Path if you go back from here. Do you think those races will let you go?"</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine was also a member of those races. The problem was that those warriors had thought that it had shifted to Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>Even in ordinary times, it was hard for it to survive alone without the Arrow Demons. Now, those races were already enraged at what it did, so the chances of them letting the Heavenly Eye Vine go were quite small.</p>

  <p>The vine thought for a while and answered, "No, they won't..."</p>

  <p>"Then what's your plan?" Zheng asked again. "I...</p>

  <p>I'd better follow you... " In reality, the Heavenly Eye Vine didn't want to follow Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>After all, the Whining Road was dangerous and full of strange things.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it was hard for it to survive alone due to its current state, even if it did reach the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"If everyone is ready, come with us. It is said that the Whining Road is very mysterious and terrifying.</p>

  <p>I think everyone here must've known about it except for Zheng, right?" Fuxi announced. In turn, Zheng's eye twitched and he glared at Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"The Whining road is indeed dangerous, but it's actually quite simple once we discover its secret.</p>

  <p>That is also why we chose it," Fuxi explained as he turned around and walked towards the road between the two rows of fences. "Everyone, please follow me closely. I'm sure we can pass safely!" he continued.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine immediately followed behind Fuxi. It was afraid of being left behind.</p>

  <p>But when it went to the front, the others got squeezed out of the line.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked helplessly at the Heavenly Eye Vine and said, "Do you want to stay in my spirit beast bag?"</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his spirit beast bag was large enough to hold the Heavenly Eye Vine.</p>

  <p>However, most creatures refused to stay in a spirit beast bag unless the bag's owner was someone they highly trusted.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the dangerous Whining Road intimidated the Heavenly Eye Vine so much, that it quickly stretched out a thin vine then touched Fuxi's head, sending him the message that it had agreed to his suggestion.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Fuxi released the Augury Dog from the spirit beast bag and put the Heavenly Eye Vine inside it. They also needed the Augury Dog to pass through the Whining Road, and he had planned to release him anyway.</p>

  <p>Then, they walked into the path between the fences one after another. The Wing King's body was too large, so he shrunk himself before he proceeded.</p>

  <p>Yet, nothing changed after they went in.</p>

  <p>There was still the endless plain in the distance. On one side was a cliff, and on the other was the end of the Purple Wind Gorge.</p>

  <p>As for the two rows of fences, they were like rows of wood lined up on the plain, which did not mean anything.</p>

  <p>But after they traveled some more, a faint white fog appeared around them.</p>

  <p>The further they moved, the thicker the white fog was.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked back and found that both the cliff and the Purple Wind Gorge disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, the two rows of fences were still there, and their positions just annoyed them. "The road between the fences is closed?" Zheng asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>There were two rows of fences before, but now they became one as if by magic.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask," the Snake Goddess hissed.</p>

  <p>Just then, her eyes glowed red, as if she tried to infuse the shadow of Snake Goddess into her eyes. He wondered what she saw when she did that.</p>

  <p>But since she told him not to ask, he just stayed quiet.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters were also confused, but they followed the Snake Goddess and Fuxi obediently.</p>

  <p>They walked for a little more, then a cabin with a spire appeared in the thick fog.</p>

  <p>When they got closer, Zheng saw that it was a thatched hut.</p>

  <p>The thatched hut had no doors, so he couldn't see what was inside.</p>

  <p>The moment they approached it, however, they felt extremely uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>To the people who had held high positions for a long time like Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, the sensation felt like an uncontrollable urge to kill each other.</p>

  <p>Still, they were in a mysterious place, so they restrained themselves.</p>

  <p>As soon as they passed the thatched hut, everyone could restrict the strange feeling inside them.</p>

  <p>However, two more thatched huts appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>All the thatched huts were closed, but the creatures inside had given them an unpleasant feeling.</p>

  <p>Driven by curiosity and uneasiness, King Ieuan could not help but ask,</p>

  <p>"What exactly is inside them?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask," the Snake Goddess stated again.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan's soybean-like eyes flashed, but it couldn't do anything but continue to move forward.</p>

  <p>When they passed by another neat row of thatched huts again, Pearson suddenly stopped. "You have to tell us what's inside them before we decide to move forward or not," he demanded.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Pearson didn't trust the Snake Goddess, but the Eternal Realm Hunters never pinned all their hopes on others.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was better if they knew things in advance so they could deal with emergencies if there were any.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes brimmed with regret. She should have told them the rules first before entering the road, but now it was too late.</p>

  <p>"It's a kind of Treacherous Being," she replied.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her answer, Pearson only frowned. He already had a rough guess of what was inside the huts, and when he forced an answer out of the Snake Goddess, he was not surprised.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Sawyer and Thurston blanched in fear, and it was clear that they were afraid.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, King Ieuan, and Zheng didn't have any reaction.</p>

  <p>Even in the Supreme Pure Realm, there weren't many creatures who knew about the existence of "Treacherous Beings." Naturally, those warriors who explored the Grand Pure Realm had never heard of them.</p>

  <p>When they saw how Sawyer and Thurston looked, however, they immediately understood that those creatures would be a challenge.</p>
