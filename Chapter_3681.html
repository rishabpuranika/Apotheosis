  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors from the four mountains weren't the only ones eager to strike Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Even Auden and the others launched their attacks simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The attacks kept coming nonstop. As powerful as he was, Emperor Charm couldn't take these attacks head on.</p>

  <p>His body flashed as small squares appeared on its surface. He tried to teleport once more, dragging the six corpses along.</p>

  <p>However, he could never get far; the corpses were truly weighing him down. No matter where he tried to flee, the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace found him and attacked.</p>

  <p>After circling the sky a few more times, Emperor Charm finally realized it'd be impossible for him to evade all these attacks, not with the six corpses he was dragging. His patience running thin, he suddenly roared furiously.</p>

  <p>Then, a crack appeared between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>A blue eyeball peeked from beneath the crack. Obviously, this eyeball was some kind of Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>For warriors at Emperor Charm's level, they would only merge with the rarest and most precious Other Shore Tokens. The warriors who had been attacking him so fiercely just now hesitated slightly, not knowing what this Other Shore Token could do.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The blue eyeball emerged from the crack and floated in front of Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"Lend me your Other Shore Token," said Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>From millions of miles away, identical blue eyeballs appeared on the foreheads of the Divine Farmer, the Yellow Thearch, and Mahoney, the leader of the New Moon race.</p>

  <p>"I thought you said this'd be a piece of cake. Did I overestimate you?"</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch teased.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap," Emperor Charm snapped coldly.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he had thought that, with the help of the Starlight Tracking Spear, killing these people should've been easy. He never expected he'd fall into such an embarrassing situation.</p>

  <p>He had been so pushed into a corner that he was forced to use the Duplicating Gemstone, which could only be used once. To make things even worse, he had to ask for help from these fellows!</p>

  <p>"Whose Other Shore Token do you want? Divine Farmer's or mine?"</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch asked.</p>

  <p>"I want Mahoney's!" Emperor Charm exclaimed impatiently.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch raised a brow in astonishment. "What on earth are you up against?"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mahoney responded calmly. Summoning her Other Shore Token, Mahoney reached out her hand and gently pressed her forehead.</p>

  <p>Both the eyeball on her forehead and the one in front of Emperor Charm flashed blue simultaneously.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Mahoney's Other Shore Token traveled through space and appeared above Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the blue eyeball allowed them to borrow each other's Other Shore Tokens, no matter how far away they were from each other!</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token that Mahoney lent Emperor Charm was called the Spearhead Armor of Destruction. It was an Other Shore Token of the descending type that could greatly enhance one's body and strength. In Emperor Charm's eyes, it was the most suitable one for this situation.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token floating above Emperor Charm melted like mercury and flowed around him, til it enveloped him completely, including his wings.</p>

  <p>After fusing with the Other Shore Token, Emperor Charm emerged in front of the crowd. His eyes flashed with killing intent.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man who wielded the bone stick had been following him closely.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man raised the bone stick in his hand the second he saw Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Emperor Charm charged directly at him, instead of escaping. In a flash, Emperor Charm had stretched out his wings and smacked the middle-aged man with incredible force.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was taken aback by this sudden attack. Without much time to react, he used the bone stick to try to block the blow.</p>

  <p>Although the bone stick was sturdy, after fusing with a new Other Shore Token, Emperor Charm's strength increased greatly. Channeling the strength into his wings, the blow was strong enough to knock the bone stick out of the middle-aged man's hand.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Left defenseless, the middle-aged man was stunned. Emperor Charm took this opportunity to land a punch onto the middle-aged man's belly. The strength in that punch was enough to pierce his belly right through, destroying his inner world completely. The middle-aged man shrieked in pain as he fell down from the sky.</p>

  <p>As the middle-aged man fell, two more warriors came at Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Raising their swords in the air, they shouted their battle cries. However, before they could even get close, a strong gust of wind blew them backwards.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm started to spin at an extremely high speed, wielding the six corpses strung to him as weapons!</p>

  <p>Since the corpses were indestructible, they became lethal missiles whizzing through the air.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>With two heavy thuds, the corpses managed to hit the two warriors, knocking them out of the sky as well.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm stopped trying to escape. Instead, he traveled through space and charged at the warriors head on.</p>

  <p>The corpses that initially held him back were now some sort of weapon!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He flung the six corpses around as he kept changing direction. Every time he emerged in the space, he would smash corpses towards the warriors in his way.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A warrior failed to dodge in time and fell from the sky after being hit by the corpses.</p>

  <p>Another tried to use spatial transference to escape. However, before he could flee into the space crack, Emperor Charm clenched his fist, crushing the space channel into shreds.</p>

  <p>The warrior stumbled out of the space channel, dazed and confused. Before he could react, a corpse smacked into him, knocking him out of the sky.</p>

  <p>Although the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace didn't die after being hit by the corpses, their Chaotic Source Spirits were instantly exhausted, and could no longer sustain their bodies. Some were so gravely injured that they were forced to retreat.</p>

  <p>Master Hai was dumbfounded as he watched this scene unfold before him.</p>

  <p>He had never expected his Other Shore Token would be used against them.</p>

  <p>After smacking warrior after warrior out of the sky, Emperor Charm managed to change the tide of the battle.</p>

  <p>Just then, a burly man teleported to Emperor Charm's side, wielding a huge sword. With a roar, he swung the sword towards Emperor Charm's head.</p>

  <p>The huge sword erupted eighty thousand divine megatons of force. When the sword radiance was produced, it was accompanied by a shrill scream.</p>

  <p>The scream supposedly had the effect of disturbing one's mind.</p>

  <p>However, Emperor Charm just sneered. Tilting his head slightly, a corpse was pulled backward. With a heavy crack, it smashed into the burly man's back. Staggering forward, the burly man was thrown off balance. Emperor Charm dodged the sword with ease, and turned to kick the burly man on the back.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The man fell from the sky like a meteor and smashed into the Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's kick had released tens of thousands of divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Dragon Hall collapsed with a loud bang at the impact.</p>

  <p>In the center of the hall, Eastern Emperor Taiyi sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. He was still trapped on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Supreme Dragon Hall was destroyed, the expressions of the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace all fell.</p>

  <p>"Go and protect Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"</p>

  <p>"We can't let him approach the Supreme Dragon Hall anymore!"</p>

  <p>"Stop him!"</p>

  <p>Chaos erupted among the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace while Emperor Charm looked down at them from the sky.</p>

  <p>He stared quietly at the figure of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, they were like blood brothers. However, in the end, they turned against each other and went along different paths.</p>

  <p>And now, it was finally the time for him to end his life...</p>

  <p>Originally, Emperor Charm planned to kill all the remaining warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace before facing Eastern Emperor Taiyi. However, at this moment, he suddenly felt that there was no need to go about it the hard way.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward, countless blue squares enveloped him, swallowing him into space.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Emperor Charm landed in front of the cross-legged figure.</p>
