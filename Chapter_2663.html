  <p>
</p>

  <p>The area was filled with No. 9527's calm but slightly threatening voice.</p>

  <p>Fuxi wasn't afraid of Othniel's soul fragment, but of Othniel himself.</p>

  <p>But, No. 9527 represented Othniel in this situation.</p>

  <p>The thought of it made Fuxi cautious.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he didn't expect that Othniel had left a strand of his soul in Zheng's body, which only showed that he thought of Zheng as highly important to him.</p>

  <p>"I once visited Othniel, but why did he refuse me? Am I really not qualified?" Fuxi said as he stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had long wanted to master a truth theurgy.</p>

  <p>He knew that he was strong and intelligent enough in every way.</p>

  <p>Yet, neither Herbert nor Othniel took him as a disciple. Herbert even posed a problem for him, which made him feel very bothered.</p>

  <p>"Are you tired of this cycle of reincarnation? Compared to the numerous creatures in the chaos, you have always been the most dazzling one. You are already very lucky!" No. 9527 countered.</p>

  <p>There was silence for a while before Fuxi shouted in anger, "Of course I am tired of it! I am tired of the endless cycles of reincarnation. Everyone will die and be born again and again. What's the point of living in this way?"</p>

  <p>"This is exactly the point, as my master once said," replied No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"Bullshit! I'm afraid your master has been also tired of such a way, or why did he choose this guy?" Fuxi complained and pointed accusingly at Zheng. When Zheng saw Fuxi was annoyed, he subconsciously dodged.</p>

  <p>He didn't want Fuxi to kill him in a fit of rage.</p>

  <p>It was because of that very matter that Fuxi had a dispute with the Snake Goddess, and left. He was stubborn, and wouldn't change his mind once he'd decided.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right. My master also gets tired. But I don't know the reason why he didn't choose you. Since he has chosen Zheng now, you shouldn't make things difficult for him," No. 9527 said.</p>

  <p>Fuxi couldn't help his eyelids twitch in irritation. He stared viciously at Zheng, before he jumped about like a possessed man and declared, "Only I can succeed! I am the chosen one! I will be the Finale Hero! Zheng is not qualified!"</p>

  <p>He had obviously gone a bit dotty, so No. 9527 and Zheng just kept quiet.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Fuxi finally calmed down.</p>

  <p>He glanced coldly at Zheng and said, "You can leave now."</p>

  <p>"Well...</p>

  <p>Are you okay?" Zheng asked. For some reason, he suddenly felt pity for Fuxi. Both of them had different goals.</p>

  <p>For Zheng, what Fuxi pursued was worthless.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had done so much but he couldn't get what he wanted, which was really pathetic.</p>

  <p>One of Fuxi's hands rested on the tombstone. He waved at Zheng with the other and said, "You have no right to care about me."</p>

  <p>Since when did he need a True God to care about him?</p>

  <p>And so, Zheng just shrugged and turned around, ready to leave.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he heard Fuxi say, "Wait a minute."</p>

  <p>He turned around and looked at Fuxi in confusion. He didn't know what the other man wanted to do.</p>

  <p>"You mainly practice the Truth of Cultivation Nature, but you haven't become a consummate True God?" Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Until now, he was still a top-rank True God, and hadn't become a consummate one yet.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, it had something to do with the Infinity Ruler in his mind.</p>

  <p>His Godly Tile was too complex and had already absorbed hundreds of kinds of Godly Ways in the divine land. Because of this, it was difficult for him to improve his cultivation level, and therefore he had not yet become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>"You're strange," said Fuxi as he stared at Zheng up and down.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, it wasn't difficult for a talented True God to reach the consummation level in the Source World--but it was extremely hard to comprehend the Truths of Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed to be the opposite.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had felt several kinds of Truths of Godly Ways from Zheng, and he could tell that the Truth of Cultivation Nature seemed to be complete. He was even qualified to cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>That was why he felt strange that Zheng was different from other True Gods.</p>

  <p>He even wondered if Othniel chose Zheng because of this.</p>

  <p>"May I have a look at your Godly Tile?" he asked. "I'm afraid not," Zheng said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>Although Fuxi didn't look hostile, Zheng did not want to show him everything.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi noticed that Zheng had become more vigilant, he just smiled.</p>

  <p>"I also cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature in the past, and thus reached the Other Shore Realm. I can help you break through the current shackles and give you some advice," he continued.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng's eyes flashed at his words.</p>

  <p>It was true that Othniel had transplanted his blood into Zheng, but this didn't help him in his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Of course, Fuxi was incredibly strong. If he gave Zheng some advice�</p>

  <p>As soon as Fuxi saw that Zheng became less stiff, he smiled and pointed at his belly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had felt his belly heat up. Before he could stop Fuxi, the man had released a strand of his soul into his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Your Godly Tile..."</p>

  <p>He was taken aback when he first saw Zheng's Godly Tile, but it was quickly replaced with laughter.</p>

  <p>"What are you laughing at?" Zheng asked with a frown. "Idiot! I thought you were special, but it turns out that you are not.</p>

  <p>Did Othniel think you could merge the Godly Ways successfully?" Fuxi chuckled. He immediately noticed that something was off with Zheng's Godly Tile as soon as the strand of his soul entered Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Godly Tile was the crystallization of a certain amount of energy.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods usually cultivated only one energy.</p>

  <p>Only a very few talented ones could master two or three kinds of energy.</p>

  <p>Such was true in both the divine land and the Source World.</p>

  <p>Still, there were many reckless people in the world.</p>

  <p>They knew that it was impossible to comprehend the truth theurgies because they came from the energy of the Godly Ways Great Unity at the dawn of chaos.</p>

  <p>That was the only chance to obtain the truth theurgies. Other than that, they could only rely on the blood transplantation of the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>However, it was even harder to have the blood of Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had tried for so long, but he still couldn't get it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they blended the energy of the Godly Ways in order to artificially create the Godly Ways Great Unity, and get the truth theurgies.</p>

  <p>They had expected a good outcome, but no one had actually succeeded.</p>

  <p>The Godly Tile that was formed from that way was not complete.</p>

  <p>As time passed by, the method was eventually abandoned.</p>

  <p>That was why the moment Fuxi saw that kind of Godly Tile on Zheng, he thought that it was ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"It's not the reason why my master chose Zheng. Of course, he knows that the merging of Godly Ways won't work," No. 9527 retorted.</p>

  <p>Fuxi nodded at its words. His lips curved into a smile. He became much more comfortable and said to Zheng, "Although you have mastered many Godly Ways, I can still help you become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Choose a Godly Way yourself."</p>
