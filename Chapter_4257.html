<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4257 The Crisis Of The Elemental Race </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Beneath the black pillars of smoke was a large city; the gathering place of the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>Spots in the Deep Space such as this were constructed quite simply and crudely, keeping with the forms of a primitive tribe. Elder Xue had introduced some unique construction techniques to the Elemental race and helped them build an exquisite city. However, it had been decimated.</p>

  <p>The Deep Space races present in the huge square had their ways of spreading news.</p>

  <p>In fact, they had already done so when the Elemental race had climbed up to two hundred feet in the Levitation Tower. They hoped Elder Xue would decipher the mysteries of the Levitation Tower, but also wanted all the information they could get from him. This made it very difficult for them to correctly choose their time of attack on the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>As the Deep Space races hesitated, waiting for their opportunity, Elder Xue and Geoffrey entered the tower and reached a height of two hundred feet. News of this mobilized them. No matter how unintelligent they were, they knew they would have to make a move as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Before Geoffrey had gotten to the top of the Levitation Tower, the five races had already set off to attack the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>At the center of the gathering place was a wooden pavilion with a narrow underground passage beneath it. In the innermost secret basement, sat the white-haired Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, Bang...</p>

  <p>A muffled sound could be heard from above.</p>

  <p>"What is that... noise?" Elder Xue asked.</p>

  <p>He was still a fourth-grade creature in nature. Although he had been in the Deep Space for a long time, he was limited to his own life level, and his understanding and awareness of his surroundings was still very unrefined.</p>

  <p>He heard the huge muffled sound, but was unable to tell its direction.</p>

  <p>A man of the Elemental race in a red robe said shakily, "Elder Xue... They are attacking the pavilion..."</p>

  <p>Elder Xue sat motionless and murmured, "So soon?"</p>

  <p>Truthfully, he had a feeling this day would come when he planned to go to the Levitation Tower with Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, I'll get you out through the tunnel!" yelled that man of the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue had built a complicated system of tunnels below the ground to make it more convenient for the Elemental race to escape.</p>

  <p>"Alright!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue nodded.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of death, but after the precious body had died, all his hopes rested on Geoffrey. No matter what, before he died, he wanted to know whether Geoffrey was capable of obtaining the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>He refused to die before seeing Geoffrey again.</p>

  <p>The man carried Elder Xue on his back, pushed open the door of the secret room and made his way towards the other end of the passageway.</p>

  <p>He had only taken a couple steps when a long spear shot at him.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Before he could react, he was impaled to the wall of the passageway and Elder Xue was thrown to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Who is here?"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue stood up with a wobble, trying to distinguish what lay before him.</p>

  <p>All he could make out were circles of various sizes. With a little bit more time he was able to slowly understand the meaning behind them. Not far away was a golden-haired Cold Ape who had lurked in from the other side of the passageway.</p>

  <p>"The Cold Ape race has always regarded you as an esteemed guest. We're much better than these members of the Elemental race. Why are you trying to escape, Elder Xue?" asked the golden-haired Cold Ape.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue pretended not to understand and made an attempt to leave.</p>

  <p>But the golden-haired Cold Ape sneered and lifted him up. With a slight snort, a layer of black light covered his body and he then took Elder Xue towards the ground above.</p>

  <p>Once he stood on the surface of the ground, he held Elder Xue and roared,</p>

  <p>"Everyone, stop!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Elemental race continued struggling, giving all they had. They had been forced to retreat, yet they remained in high spirits. But seeing Elder Xue captured stunned them.</p>

  <p>The other races of the Deep Space frothed at the mouth in greed when they saw Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>The news that Geoffrey had reached the top of the Levitation Tower had not yet reached them. They just wanted the information about the Levitation Tower from Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>"We have nothing against the Elemental race. As long as you are willing to tell us the secrets of the Levitation Tower, our five races will leave, okay?" said the golden-haired Cold Ape menacingly.</p>

  <p>"The Wrona race agrees!"</p>

  <p>"So do we..."</p>

  <p>"I agree!"</p>

  <p>Each race echoed the last.</p>

  <p>The Cold Ape placed Elder Xue in front of him and said one word at a time, "I know you know our language. Do not pretend you don't. If you don't tell us what we want to know, we will kill the entire Elemental race!"</p>

  <p>This was a seriously deadly threat. Elder Xue had established and developed a deep relationship with the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>It was not that he was unwilling to reveal anything about the Levitation Tower, but by the rules of the tower, these wild races were unqualified to reach a height of two hundred feet in it!</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment and the golden-haired Cold Ape ran a finger across his own neck, gesturing the cutting of a throat. "Kill them all!"</p>

  <p>They were about to resume the slaughter...</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue called out. He then said, in a language he was clearly unskilled in, "After reaching two hundred feet of the Levitation Tower, you only need to answer some questions..."</p>

  <p>All he could do was to tell the truth.</p>

  <p>But he knew that once he told them what he knew, he and those of the Elemental race would be killed.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he tried formulating a plan to get out of this situation. In all his years, he had never encountered such passivity among so many enemies. After all, these Deep Space races also had gripes and issues with each other and would not join hands to attack the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>He genuinely had no way to deal with his current predicament.</p>

  <p>He was in despair and had almost lost all hope when he suddenly felt a powerful wave.</p>

  <p>If Elder Xue could feel the energy, these Deep Space races could feel it much clearer. They sensed a powerful wave of energy coming from the sky. By the time they saw it clearly, it was only a hundred feet away from the golden-haired Cold Ape.</p>

  <p>The golden-haired Cold Ape sensed that something was wrong and was about to run, but it was too late.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's burly body plummeted like a mountain, smashing the golden-haired Cold Ape into the soil.</p>

  <p>Everything else in Elder Xue's eyes were made up of rings, but he saw Geoffrey as clear as day.</p>

  <p>A huge sense of relief washed over him when he saw Geoffrey and the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand. "What... What are you doing here? You should go back to the chaos to find Master Kincaid..."</p>

  <p>"I can't find a way back," Geoffrey said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"But it's too dangerous here. You shouldn't have come," insisted Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>"That's not an issue!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey bellowed with a confident grin.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff and slammed it into the ground twice. His own power began to drain rapidly and was absorbed by the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>He had discovered this ability of the Heavenly Ring Staff when he was at the top of the Levitation Tower. The staff needed to absorb power to be a help to him.</p>

  <p>The staff had taken a lot of his power this time. His limbs felt weak and the Heavenly Ring Staff then released an intense pressure that swept through almost everything. The members of the Elemental race and the other races then felt as if their legs had been filled with lead. They all collapsed face first into the ground, unable to get up again.</p>
