<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3458 The Difference In Strength </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack"</p>

  <p>There were a few faint cracking sounds, before the statues were decapitated in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>In turn, Mount had gotten even more perplexed at the sight of it.</p>

  <p>He couldn't resist those Regal Jade statues even in his best condition. He would choose to exile them, if it were him fighting with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mount's failure could be attributed to his Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Since his bloodline was strong, he didn't have to rely on the Other Shore Tokens very much.</p>

  <p>The several Other Shore Tokens he possessed were of strengthening type, and he used them just for their Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>However, the Other Shore had experienced countless rounds of chaos. As a result, the Other Shore had obtained too many resources, various kinds of methods, and incredible skills as time passed.</p>

  <p>So no matter how powerful Mount was, there was nothing he could do when he was bound by Chaim's abacus.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Other Shore Token that the Evil God had merged with should represent a civilization. Otherwise, it was impossible for such a world to descend.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God was able to find a civilization to back him up, which was a great opportunity. Zheng, just throw in the towel..." Mount murmured.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God had destroyed the seventh group of Regal Jade statues, there was only one statue left beside Zheng. It was the eighty-first statue.</p>

  <p>The eightieth statue possessed 8, 000 divine megatons of power, and the eighty-first statue possessed 8, 100 divine megatons of power. There was just a very small difference between the two.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, the Evil God had destroyed ten statues at a time, and to deal with the last one would just be a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God hovered in the air at a slow, leisurely pace. He was only over a hundred feet away from Zheng. "Do you really just have such small, pathetic amount of power and such little tricks to fight me? I never take pity on the weak. If your remaining trump card is only this chessboard, I will not even be interested in merging with you..." he said and mentally sighed.</p>

  <p>Zheng had once been the Creator to him, who was omnipotent. The Evil God used to kneel down before him and even look up to him.</p>

  <p>Unconsciously, he had completely surpassed him. As the Evil God looked down on Zheng, he felt that Zheng was incomparably weak and could not withstand a single blow.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng didn't say anything as he was deep in thought.</p>

  <p>'The extreme force should be up to about 8, 000 divine megatons...</p>

  <p>But the black bone blades in his arms are even stronger.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade statues could not withstand a single blow from him.'</p>

  <p>As his thoughts swam in his head, he pushed out the last piece on the Regal Jade chessboard.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The last Regal Jade statue turned into a giant beast and pounced on the Evil God at a surprisingly high speed.</p>

  <p>The moment the Regal Jade Beast rushed in front of the Evil God, the Evil God suddenly twisted his body and punched it in the face.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>When the Evil God had hit the Regal Jade Beast, it stretched out its huge claws and tried to grab its opponent.</p>

  <p>With its strength, the last Regal Jade Beast was powerful enough to fight against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God saw the two large claws rush towards him, he moved his arms, and the black bone blades in his arms turned into two rays of black radiance.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>The black radiance sliced off the Regal Jade Beast's sharp claws!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>He suddenly raised his right arm, and then another black radiance shot out and cut the Regal Jade Beast's stomach into half!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Finally, the last Regal Jade Beast fell down.</p>

  <p>"It's over. It's your turn."</p>

  <p>The Evil God no longer hesitated. He rushed towards Zheng like a raptor and swiftly covered the short distance between them.</p>

  <p>He dragged the two black bone blades in his right arm across the air and spread a trace of energy. If the powerful warriors hadn't reinforced the space of the Chaotic Source World, then he would have been able to cause a series of cracks in the space.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Prepared to face the impact of the Evil God's attack, the cyan feather above Zheng's head flashed faintly. He was like a leaf that swayed gently in the wind, as the feather followed the energy wave to constantly dodge and retreat.</p>

  <p>There was only a serious expression on the Evil God's face.</p>

  <p>Of course, he knew that Zheng had a very artful bodily movement skill, but it was useless for him to dodge. In his eyes, everything that Zheng was doing was all in vain.</p>

  <p>He could evade one attack, but could he avoid 100 attacks, 1, 000 attacks, or even 10, 000 attacks?</p>

  <p>If he was hit even once, he would be crushed.</p>

  <p>Between the two of them, one was invincible, and the other was adept. It was truly a fierce chase in the eyes of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Although most people of the Pear Hill were still besieging the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Yan was not in the mood to check on them. Her fists were balled so tightly that her nails dug into her flesh.</p>

  <p>Her brother was in great danger now. Every attack from the Evil God made her so worried and scared!</p>

  <p>Sally, Hutton, Feng Ge and the others seemed to be very nervous as well.</p>

  <p>Among the crowd, however, only Dorothy looked different. Her eyes were filled with hesitation, and it looked like she did not dare to make a decision.</p>

  <p>If a decision was made, then there would be a high price to pay. If that happened, then she would disappoint her grandmother who had painstakingly cultivated her for so many years.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng ran away and was able to avoid the attack from the black bone blades.</p>

  <p>A ray of white light quickly appeared in his right eye.</p>

  <p>"Authentic Visual World!"</p>

  <p>The instant Zheng had activated the Authentic Visual World, his eyebrows shot up to his forehead. There was still no flaw!</p>

  <p>He had long confirmed that the Authentic Visual World could not be used to check the Chaotic Source Realm warriors. Back when he had observed the queen ant, he also couldn't find a flaw on it.</p>

  <p>But it didn't mean there was no flaw at all. It was just that the flaws had been covered up because of the Chaotic Source Spirits' special function.</p>

  <p>By the time the Chaotic Source Spirits were exhausted, the weakness would show up naturally.</p>

  <p>Now, the Evil God was not a powerful warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm; but there still wasn't a flaw that could be found on him, which made no sense.</p>

  <p>'Is he indestructible in this strangely-colored world?'</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't care what Zheng thought, and attacked him again.</p>

  <p>When the black bone blades brushed past Zheng once more, a layer of dark color suddenly emerged on his hand. It turned out that he protected his right hand with the Shade Stone liquid, and gently stroked the Evil God's bone blades right after.</p>

  <p>"Endless Restoring Method!"</p>

  <p>What Zheng did was that he tried to disintegrate the bone blades.</p>

  <p>When he made use of the theurgy of Truth of Three-Energy Construction, however, the black bone blades unexpectedly stayed unmoved!</p>

  <p>The Endless Restoring Method was not able to disintegrate all materials.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Zheng's current ability only allowed him to break ordinary solid objects, and these black bone blades were clearly strong to a horrible extent.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not shatter them.</p>

  <p>In return, the strong force eroded Zheng's right hand the moment he touched the bone blades. His right arm grew numb even under the protection of the Shade Stone liquid.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was a little distracted, the Evil God quickly waved his hands and the bone blades rushed towards Zheng's head. The black light under the high-speed spinning movement almost turned into a black flower.</p>

  <p>The flower caged Zheng. After he floated up and down inside it for a while, he was finally forced into a hopeless situation, and there was no room for him to dodge.</p>
