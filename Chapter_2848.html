  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pascal slowly climbed down the stairs in the center of the palace under the silent gaze of the fiends.</p>

  <p>His body was shrouded in black mist.</p>

  <p>The mist spiraled up and around him and gathered on his back, forming into two huge majestic wings!</p>

  <p>The fiends, who were known to be fearless, now looked worried as they witnessed Pascal's power.</p>

  <p>He walked down the stairs slowly and gracefully, shot an indifferent glance at the fiends, and ordered flatly, "Kneel before me!"</p>

  <p>His short command contained absolute authority that nobody dared to defy.</p>

  <p>The fiend race was extremely arrogant. Even though Li Luo had been in the Abyss Demon Region for so many years, she never succeeded in making the fiends submit to her.</p>

  <p>But now, with a simple order, Pascal had made all the fiends obediently kneel before him.</p>

  <p>After the great fiends died, the others of their race scrambled for the position of the new ruler. During the relatively short period of struggle, they devoured many other beasts, which caused their bodies to grow big.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>They all fell on their knees with a thunderous boom.</p>

  <p>Even the rebellious little fiends now lay motionless on the ground, in awe of their new master.</p>

  <p>Pascal sat down on the broad steps regally.</p>

  <p>Just then, another figure walked out from the back of the palace. It was his father, Samuel.</p>

  <p>He looked around the palace and appeared satisfied.</p>

  <p>Samuel turned back and shot a glance at his son, gesturing him to raise his right hand.</p>

  <p>Pascal wore a red ring on the middle finger of his right hand. When Samuel stared at the ring, his eyes turned wild. He couldn't help but reach out to touch the ring.</p>

  <p>But the moment he reached for the ring, his finger began melting.</p>

  <p>The sharp pain snapped him back to his senses.</p>

  <p>He had made the same mistake before as well.</p>

  <p>As a Holy Being, he was not allowed to master the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>When he had discovered the ring from a cellar, he couldn't resist the temptation of touching the ring, and instantly his finger had started melting in the same way.</p>

  <p>Luckily, as a Holy Being, he could heal such small wounds very easily.</p>

  <p>He had to release Pascal from his inner world as he was left with no other choice.</p>

  <p>He had saved Pascal by putting him in his inner world when Nicholas employed the Furnace of Dark and Light, which now left him the chance to control the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>It was all fate. It meant that he was destined to rule the Abyss Demon Region. This thought pleased him greatly.</p>

  <p>"Bring the woman here," ordered Samuel gruffly.</p>

  <p>Pascal nodded his head stiffly. Soon the ring on his middle finger emitted a circle of bright red light.</p>

  <p>And with that the entire Abyss Demon Region began to shake slightly.</p>

  <p>The fiends kneeling on the ground all looked on curiously. In the far distance, it seemed that something was rapidly approaching.</p>

  <p>There was a rumbling sound, and plumes of smoke billowed and spread into the air.</p>

  <p>Soon, a huge head appeared in front of the fiends.</p>

  <p>The head rolled all the way up to the palace, crushing some fiends en route.</p>

  <p>They were unable to move out of the way and could only watch in horror as the head rolled over them. Fortunately, their bodies were strong enough to bear the pain.</p>

  <p>The head rolled to a halt in front of Pascal. Its mouth opened and spat out a person. It was Li Luo.</p>

  <p>Li Luo, who was lying on the ground, appeared bedraggled and looked at Samuel sadly.</p>

  <p>The fiends were a little surprised to see Li Luo in such an awful state.</p>

  <p>The fiend race was the strongest in the Abyss Demon Region. This woman was the only creature that they would not dare to offend. They never thought that even she was unable to escape Samuel's clutches.</p>

  <p>Samuel hopped down the stairs and ambled towards Li Luo.</p>

  <p>He was about to speak when suddenly a fluctuation of space occurred near Li Luo.</p>

  <p>It was caused by Samuel's clone, who was flying in the air and trying to save Li Luo.</p>

  <p>Samuel turned his head and glanced at Pascal. The latter was quick to act!</p>

  <p>He raised his hand and with a flash of light from the ring, the space channel built by the Spear of Supreme Harmony disappeared immediately.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Samuel's replica let out a howl of pain as his body contorted horribly, and the duplicate Spear of Supreme Harmony broke in half.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The replica kept getting twisted and soon turned into strands of Faith Energy, which then vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>"You are such a stubborn woman. The entire Abyss Demon Region is under my control now. Even if you manage to escape from me, where will you hide? Are you expecting the black water to protect you? I hope not!" sneered Samuel disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Li Luo's eyelids trembled slightly. She averted her eyes and remained silent with a stubborn look on her face.</p>

  <p>Samuel caught her chin and continued, "I know you can't be killed as a creature in the forbidden land, but I have thousands of ways of torturing you."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish, a sharp brown thorn shot out from Li Luo's fingertip all of a sudden!</p>

  <p>If the thorn were to be stabbed on Samuel's head, it was lethal enough to pierce his soul to pieces!</p>

  <p>However, the thorn stopped when it was near his chin.</p>

  <p>Even though Li Luo had summoned all her force of primitive fear, the thorn wouldn't budge.</p>

  <p>Samuel shook his head and smiled indulgently. He said, "You are a good woman. Surrender to me!"</p>

  <p>Just then...</p>

  <p>Pascal activated the ring once more.</p>

  <p>An invisible force befell Li Luo's body.</p>

  <p>She knelt in front of Samuel, unable to oppose.</p>

  <p>However, her eyes flashed in defiance as she glowered at him. She looked furious, dangerous and beautiful all at once.</p>

  <p>"Everything in the Abyss Demon Region belongs to me. You're great, especially with your magic of cloning. If you follow me, we can conquer the entire divine land together..." Samuel explained calmly.</p>

  <p>"No way!" Li Luo spat angrily. She jeered, "Even if you really control the Abyss Demon Region, it doesn't matter to me! Besides, the divine land is not as simple as you think..."</p>

  <p>Samuel shook his head wearily and asked, "You are referring to the Other Shore Realm warriors, right?"</p>

  <p>Li Luo was astonished. "How did you know about that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Samuel pointed at his head and said, "All of Nicholas's memories exist here."</p>

  <p>Thanks to Nicholas's memories, he already knew about the Yellow Emperor Guards and the Other Shore Realm warriors outside the divine land. He knew everything that Nicholas knew.</p>

  <p>"You think you can just swoop in and take Nicholas's position? Hah! The Yellow Emperor Guards will not let you go easily," said Li Luo.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had briefed her about the situation of the entire divine land, so she knew that the Yellow Emperor Guards had been supporting Nicholas behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>Samuel bent down and regarded Li Luo with a weird smile. He suddenly laughed maniacally for a while before saying, "I didn't expect you to be so naive even after staying in the Abyss Demon Region for such a long time!"</p>
