<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 201 Fierce Fight In The Sky (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>However, Aldrich's strength was incomparable.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had applied all his power, he failed to break the transparent enchantment. However, Aldrich merely grasped it, and there was a clear sound of crushing.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, Aldrich's claw pierced a hole through the enchantment, and at that point, he tried to seize the girl.</p>

  <p>Floating in the air, Yolande saw the demon king's claw reaching to grab her. Even so, she remained unmoved and just blinked her grey eyes. A light flashed on the broken transparent enchantment.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, the enchantment repaired itself. The demon king's claw, which was passing through the hole of the enchantment, was cut off in the process.</p>

  <p>When that happened, Aldrich howled in pain. His loud cry appeared to shake the dark sky.</p>

  <p>However, when the demon king started to howl, another sharp enchantment protracted from the primary enchantment that cut his claw and soared towards him. While it clung to his broken arm, the light flashed again and turned into a box, which trapped the whole arm in it.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Several more enchantments appeared in the box quickly and sliced Aldrich's arm into several parts.</p>

  <p>Everyone who witnessed the gruesome outcome frowned. They could not help but wonder how painful it must have felt being in Aldrich's place. Secretly, they were just relieved it was not their hand that was cut in several pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also terrified. It turned out that the name 'Killer Girl' was not out of nothing. In his opinion, the girl was more horrifying than the demon.</p>

  <p>Aldrich was in pain and finally knew how to behave. He stumbled backward rapidly, just enough to stay out of Yolande's attacking range.</p>

  <p>The demon king glared at her with a contorted expression on his ugly face and said, "Woman, I will eat all of your body including your bones!"</p>

  <p>The unfazed girl stared at Aldrich with her big grey eyes and retorted expressionlessly, "Such a chatty demon is rare!"</p>

  <p>The black evil spirit on Aldrich's body rose suddenly. It emerged from his broken arm unceasingly and spun to tangle. After what felt like a quick few seconds, the broken arm was complete again.</p>

  <p>"I will eat you! Come on, guys. Let's kill them. Tear these useless humans to pieces!" Aldrich commanded. When they heard his order, Oceiros and the two ordinary demon kings stretched out their wings and dashed towards the humans.</p>

  <p>The Governor, Spencer, waved his big hammer with the life vitality burning. "Everyone, fight!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Shoo..."</p>

  <p>The life vitality on the figures of the powerful men rose immediately in different colors such as red, green, white, purple, and so on.</p>

  <p>Their powers were so terrifying that they masked the light of the moon and stars.</p>

  <p>In the sky, the rays of light furiously emerged one after another. Besides the rays, the life vitality developed into other things as well.</p>

  <p>For example, Lennie's tiny silver sword and Hugh's five-clawed golden dragon. They were all swirling around and attacking the four demon kings.</p>

  <p>Out of everyone, though, Spencer's power was the most outrageous. His life vitality formed a great god with a height of several feet that enveloped his entire body.</p>

  <p>The great god held a hammer in each hand and banged them together with a thud. Then, he waved one hammer and tried to smash the demon king with it.</p>

  <p>All four demon kings had powerful strength. They flapped their wings unceasingly and glided back and forth in the crowd. While dodging each attack, they simultaneously waited for an opening to retaliate.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Yolande's counterattack earlier, she had provoked Aldrich to a point where the demon king ignored the other powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Instead of taking down others first, he rushed to fight her straightaway.</p>

  <p>The girl did not show any expression on her face but reclined backward to retreat. She summoned and continuously flung transparent enchantments with her hands.</p>

  <p>Her transparent enchantment was impregnable to Luo Luo Zheng, and yet it collapsed as soon as it reached the demon king's strong body.</p>

  <p>The entire time, Luo Luo Zheng was floating beside Yolande. Seeing the battle between Aldrich and Yolande upset the man in a way he could not explain.</p>

  <p>He felt he was out of luck, being involved in a battle of such an extreme level.</p>

  <p>The demon king's strength was so horrifying. Although Luo Luo Zheng was strong, Aldrich could probably crush his body to pieces at any time.</p>

  <p>What was more, he did not have any chance to flee and was forced to watch their fight. As he felt he did not control his life, he could do nothing else but pray that Aldrich would not hit him.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Just then, another screech suddenly caught everyone's attention. It appeared that Oceiros had killed another powerful man of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The humans seemed to be at a disadvantage in the particular battle.</p>

  <p>When Oceiros joined the two demon kings, they did not give their opponents a chance to breathe.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yolande made Aldrich run away from her repeatedly. The demon king she was battling was probably the fiercest and most powerful demon king among them.</p>

  <p>Yet, no matter how many times he attacked, he could not get close enough to Yolande.</p>

  <p>When they were chasing and running around, Luo Luo Zheng heard another explosion. His eyes sought for the source, and in an instant, he saw the life vitality great god of Spencer wave the huge hammer and smash a demon king!</p>

  <p>The attack of the hammer could probably smash an entire hill, but to everyone's surprise, the demon king only sustained an injury. He had such a strong body!</p>

  <p>'Alas! On such a battle, all I can do is to cheer them on, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself and sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Aldrich felt the pressure of his fellows and attacked Yolande more crazily.</p>

  <p>Although the girl's expression remained detached, Luo Luo Zheng could tell that her stress levels had shot up as well!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>After the demon king smashed through several enchantments, suddenly there was a bluish grey bone spur stretching out of his body.</p>

  <p>No one saw it coming. As the bone spur was shot, it was not aimed at Yolande. Instead, Aldrich had planned to hit Luo Luo Zheng who was behind her!</p>

  <p>"Fuck..." When Luo Luo Zheng saw the bone spur rushing towards him, he could not help but curse his twisted fate.</p>
