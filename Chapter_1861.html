  <p>
</p>

  <p>With constant pressure building on the surface of the Magic Golden Stone, kinetic energy began to spread across the entire stone.</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's glove, which was formed by the power of Nine Divine Stars, finally burst open.</p>

  <p>He also pulled his right hand back on reflex.</p>

  <p>He was not able to control such an incredible amount of power. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When he brought his fist down on the Magic Golden Stone, there would be quite a strong reaction.</p>

  <p>However, this reaction force was not aimed at Luo Zheng's body. After all, there was still half an inch between his glove and his fist.</p>

  <p>If this reaction force landed directly on Luo Zheng's fist, his right arm would have shattered from the impact.</p>

  <p>As he quickly retracted his fist, his body swayed slightly. He let out a breath of air. This kind of power was terrifying, and it wasn't easy for him to control it. He had to be very careful, as he was playing with fire.</p>

  <p>Chapman was shocked to see the extent of Luo Zheng's power on the rock.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his legs felt like jelly. He was trembling from the shock.</p>

  <p>He was quick as lightning. He suddenly leaped off the Magic Golden Stone and flipped up in the air using strength. Then he landed firmly on the ground.</p>

  <p>The moment his feet touched the ground, he saw the Magic Golden Stone shoot forward at high speed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When such a large mass moved at such alarming speeds, there were bound to be changes in the atmosphere. The Magic Golden Stone was extremely heavy, and as it hurtled through the air, fist-sized cyclones were formed, which went spiraling off in different directions.</p>

  <p>Even the surface of the square, which had been paved with Silver Astral Stones, produced deep dents because of the Magic Golden Stone's movement.</p>

  <p>Based on this, one could fathom the amount of power that Luo Luo Zheng was employing.</p>

  <p>One foot...</p>

  <p>Ten feet...</p>

  <p>Twenty feet...</p>

  <p>Thirty feet...</p>

  <p>Forty feet...</p>

  <p>Fifty feet!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A loud bang was heard.</p>

  <p>A building of the Collapsing Mountain race was fifty feet away from where the Magic Golden Stone was originally standing. This building was also built from Silver Astral Stones. Since its construction, it had been used to store all sorts of beast bones and blood. Almost all the blood grooves in the square were gathered there.</p>

  <p>A strong inertia boosted the Magic Golden Stone forward, directly smashing into the building.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The entire building, which was made of Silver Astral Stones, crumbled to a heap with a loud crash, completely engulfing the Magic Golden Stone.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was in a state of shock when he saw the damage caused by his punch. He remained rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>He thought to himself, 'This is bad. I used way too much power.'</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Luo Luo Zheng had used the power of the Nine Divine Stars. He was unable to manipulate the power properly, or rather, he didn't know how much power was contained within the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>He had only used one twentieth of the power, and it wasn't much in his eyes. But he did not think that it would bestow such explosive strength on him.</p>

  <p>The most important thing was that the power of Luo Zheng's punch was tilted downwards. Therefore, there was a lot of friction between the Magic Golden Stone and the Silver Astral Stones on the ground. If he had punched upwards, the Magic Golden Stone would probably fly away into the unknown.</p>

  <p>This scene astounded Luo Luo Zheng himself, so naturally the bystanders were as dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The stone was blocked by the building, so it could only slide a maximum of fifty feet forward. If the building had not been there to obstruct the stone's path, how far would it slide?</p>

  <p>A thousand feet? Two thousand feet?</p>

  <p>Honestly, it didn't matter how far the stone could go.</p>

  <p>Using the Magic Golden Stone to test the power of the warriors had been a tradition of the Collapsing Mountain race for many years.</p>

  <p>The best record so far was thirty-one feet.</p>

  <p>Of course, this record was only of those warriors who had entered the Sacred Spring Mountain for the first time.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the senior hunters of the Collapsing Mountain race were able to propel the Magic Golden Stone forward three to four hundred feet. As for a mighty warrior like Chapman, if he used his full strength, he could achieve the same result as Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>This was quite something considering the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had only been here for half a year. How did he match up to Chapman and the others?</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had first arrived, he was a foreign martial artist who could only lie motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing the collapsed building, everyone gathered at the square sank into pin-drop silence.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu, however, flashed a big smile. "I told you, I believe the flower seller."</p>

  <p>Kennan gulped. "This power isn't enough for him to set foot in the Soul Suppressing Cliff."</p>

  <p>"Of course I know, but do you really think this is Luo Zheng's best performance? He didn't retreat!" Han Liusu stared at Kennan and smiled.</p>

  <p>This was a common sense problem. Many of the martial artists present had overlooked this, but people like Chapman and Han Liusu had caught it.</p>

  <p>The destruction caused by the Magic Golden Stone was very distracting, but they were paying close attention to Luo Zheng's movements. Luo Luo Zheng did not retreat!</p>

  <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When you punch a person, the reactionary force acts upon you.</p>

  <p>If a body refiner were to violently hammer his fists down on the ground, the reactionary force would thrust him upwards and send him soaring into the sky.</p>

  <p>Common sense dictated that when Luo Zheng's punch landed on the Magic Golden Stone, he would be sent flying backwards by the reactionary force as the mass of his own body was many times smaller than that of the stone.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was able to stabilize his body, and the only effect of the reactionary force on him was a slight sway of his body on the same spot.</p>

  <p>Chapman and Han Liusu felt that Luo Luo Zheng still had some strength left in him, which was why he was able to withstand the force.</p>

  <p>But after chewing on this theory for a while, they realized that it didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng's remaining strength was enough to resist the reactionary force from the Magic Golden Stone, his physical body probably wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p>

  <p>And if Luo Zheng's body was terrifyingly tough, then he should have made two deep footprints in the ground paved by the Silver Astral Stones or broken some of the Silver Astral Stones.</p>

  <p>The problem was that neither of these things happened.</p>

  <p>The reactionary force seemed to have simply disappeared in his case, and he remained unmoved like a rock! The others were unable to solve this mystery, but they had to face the reality in front of them at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Um... I don't know why Luo Luo Zheng hasn't retreated either." Kennan's mind was reeling as he couldn't figure out what was going on.</p>

  <p>"Then don't make statements that Luo Luo Zheng isn't powerful enough to set foot in the Soul Suppressing Cliff." Liusu's lips curled up as a proud expression appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>Kennan was helpless. He turned around and looked at the few people behind him. The world lords, too, had helpless looks on their faces. Just like Kennan, they were both shocked and confused.</p>

  <p>"How the hell did you do it?" Chapman asked Luo Luo Zheng directly, not bothering to hide his curiosity.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's performance had far exceeded Chapman's expectations. In fact, Chapman was feeling threatened. He had originally hoped that Luo Luo Zheng would grow as fast as he could by obtaining as much strength source as possible in the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's performance blew his mind, shattering all his preconceived notions about Luo Luo Zheng. Even though Chapman was a reliable and straightforward man, he still found it hard to accept it.</p>

  <p>"You mean how I shoved the rock out?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. He too was vexed, and could only come up with some lame excuse to explain his strength.</p>

  <p>He did not expect this to be Chapman's concern. Chapman shook his head and said, "No. I want to know how you were able to hold your position and not retreat."</p>

  <p>"I... I didn't retreat?" Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback for a moment, but then he immediately cursed in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had withdrawn his fist just in time to avoid the counter-force from the glove. Therefore, the reactionary force was greatly reduced due to the fact that he did not come into direct contact with the rock.</p>

  <p>In this case, his performance was way too calm and casual.</p>

  <p>If he had known that this would happen, Luo Luo Zheng would have retreated several thousand feet before stopping. That way, the others wouldn't suspect him.</p>

  <p>"I've practiced some token that allows me to transfer the power out of my body. That is why I didn't retreat," Luo Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>It was not lie. Indeed, he had used the power of the Nine Divine Stars and turned it into an invisible glove.</p>

  <p>Chapman was not one to fall for it at all. He only said, "Each age brings forth new geniuses. You are indeed a genius!" The serious expression on his face suddenly changed. He became amicable as he smiled and added,</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! You've broken this record and obtained the title of wild king. You can join the Divinity Hunt Squad now."</p>

  <p>If one wanted to be a wild king, one had to push the stone ten feet away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already pushed it to a distance of fifty feet. Unfortunately, the Collapsing Mountain race only had four titles and there was no higher rank.</p>

  <p>At this point, two children from the Collapsing Mountain race quickly walked over. After bowing at Chapman, one of the children said, "Come with me, Luo Luo Zheng. The prophet wants to meet you."</p>

  <p>"The prophet? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only found out that there was a prophet in the Collapsing Mountain race after he entered the Sacred Spring Mountain. He had been here for half a year and had never once seen him before.</p>
