<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng turned into an incarnation and appeared in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>As soon as the wives heard the news, their moods transformed instantly.</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes flashed with excitement, her face filled with anticipation.</p>

  <p>Margaret started humming under her breath, unable to contain her joy and eagerness to accompany Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Aura remained calm. She was grateful Zheng would come back to the fairy palace every now and then.</p>

  <p>As for Xun, although she didn't say a word, she stopped her cultivation. Biting her lip, she was also curious about the legendary Source World.</p>

  <p>In a flash of white light, they teleported to a courtyard, their faces eager and full of curiosity.</p>

  <p>Xun stretched out her hand as though trying to touch the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Sniffing, she said calmly, "There doesn't seem to be much of a difference between this place and the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, there is not much difference," Zheng echoed with a curt nod.</p>

  <p>There was a huge gap between the universe and the divine land. After all, the universe was only an inner world, and it was essentially different from the real world with regards to rules. The divine land was created by Chiyou, but it wasn't any different from the Source World.</p>

  <p>Margaret strolled around the courtyard, her eyes wandering. These courtyard houses were constructed for the elite disciples of the Flow Sword Sect. The pavilions and terraces were beautifully built. 'This wouldn't be a bad place to live, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>However, she saw something that made her eyes narrow. Hurrying to Zheng's side, Margaret pointed at the two women who stood nearby. Trish and Carrie exchanged uneasy glances, as Margaret said in a forced tone, "These two beautiful girls must be your new girlfriends, right, dear?"</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that this would happen if he released Margaret. However, if he were to allow Yudie and the rest to come out without her, he knew she'd feel terrible.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to explain, Carrie bowed humbly towards Margaret.</p>

  <p>"My Lady, we are Mr. Luo's maids."</p>

  <p>Margaret blinked in confusion. Even Yudie, Xun, and the other girls felt this was a bit peculiar.</p>

  <p>Given Zheng's character, he certainly didn't need any maid, let alone two maids!</p>

  <p>"You are maids?" Margaret chuckled. "Since we're here, there's no need for you to take care of Zheng. You may leave now."</p>

  <p>Carrie, at a loss for words, glanced at Trish for help. Trish, on the other hand, just scowled.</p>

  <p>She eyed the women standing next to Zheng, and suddenly felt uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>They were all good-looking and refined.</p>

  <p>Before this, she was under the impression that Zheng focused on martial arts and was indifferent to love. Never could she have expected that he actually had a big family waiting for him in his inner world. But, on second thought, Zheng was indeed an excellent man; it was no wonder he managed to attract the attention of many women.</p>

  <p>However, Margaret's searing words had left her feeling a bit depressed.</p>

  <p>After all of the suffering they'd been through, she and Carrie had finally gotten a chance to enter this courtyard house, thanks to Zheng. And yet, Margaret wanted to chase them away just when they got here!</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you're being too overbearing, My Lady?" said Trish in a restrained tone.</p>

  <p>Margaret's eyebrows shot up. "Overbearing? How dare you speak to me like that! You're just a maid!"</p>

  <p>"We are sent by the Flow Sword Sect to take care of Mr. Luo, so you can't dismiss us. We need to report Mr. Luo's cultivation to the sect and inform him of the affairs of the sect." Trish remained level headed.</p>

  <p>Margaret didn't reply. She didn't know what the Flow Sword Sect was.</p>

  <p>Among the women in the fairy palace, Xun was the only one who cared about cultivation. Every time he appeared, she would definitely ask for advice, and Zheng would teach her everything he knew.</p>

  <p>Yudie, by contrast, cared about her husband's future, where he was, and what force he was in, and sometimes she would give him advice.</p>

  <p>As for Margaret, she never really thought about anything other than being with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Trish's words immediately intimidated Margaret.</p>

  <p>Grasping for words, Margaret huffed and said, "Fine. You will only deliver messages, right?"</p>

  <p>She stretched out her hand. A purple sword suddenly materialized. With a gentle wave of her finger, the purple sword moved.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The sword dragged its way down the courtyard, drawing a line.</p>

  <p>"I can take care of my husband," Margaret said haughtily. "You may have the other side of the courtyard. You may not cross this line unless you have a message to deliver."</p>

  <p>Seeing Margaret's arrogant expression, Trish was overwhelmed with anger.</p>

  <p>She had thought that this woman was gentle and handsome, and that she would be the easiest person to get along with. But it turned out that she was being the most unreasonable.</p>

  <p>Yudie and Xun couldn't help but smile and titter at Margaret's rude behavior. They gotten used to her arrogance and bullying over the years.</p>

  <p>However, upon seeing Trish's and Carrie's distressed expressions, Yudie took the sword from Margaret. "Quit looking for trouble. Since Zheng has joined the Flow Sword Sect, he has to go by their rules. Don't make things difficult for him."</p>

  <p>This wasn't the divine land; it was the Oneness Sky Palace in the Source World. Her husband was just a disciple now. He couldn't be as presumptuous as he was back in the divine land. Yudie was keenly aware of this, while Margaret remained blissfully ignorant.</p>

  <p>Under the persuasion of Aura and Yudie, Margaret finally caved, but she still made a rule: Trish and Carrie couldn't enter Zheng's room.</p>

  <p>The next few days passed peacefully.</p>

  <p>Trish left the courtyard house early in the morning and came back with a brocade box in her hands.</p>

  <p>She carried the brocade box and headed straight to the second floor of the house. Margaret leaned on the side of the corridor, effectively blocking Trish's way.</p>

  <p>"This is something secret that the Flow Sword Sect has sent to Mr. Luo. I need to give it to him in person," said Trish through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>The past few days, everyone had been having a good time, but Trish and Margaret still had some disputes.</p>

  <p>"I'll hand it over to my husband by myself. You cannot step into his room,"</p>

  <p>Margaret said haughtily.</p>

  <p>"You have no right to touch such a precious thing!" Trish could no longer contain her anger.</p>

  <p>"You!" Margaret turned red. There was no way she would tolerate this.</p>

  <p>When she raised her hand to slap Trish on the face, someone suddenly coughed.</p>

  <p>The two women whipped their heads in the direction of the sound.</p>

  <p>Much to their surprise, there was a handsome, middle-aged man with a long beard standing in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>When Margaret sensed the aura of this middle-aged man, there was a trace of fear in her eyes. Even though she always went far in bullying others, she knew that this man's strength was formidable.</p>

  <p>"Let me personally send the manual on the Flow Swordsmanship in. I have something to say to Zheng," Athemar said calmly.</p>

  <p>Then he came up to Trish, took the box in her hands, and walked directly into the room on the second floor. He placed the box in front of Zheng, and then said with a smile, "You knew I came, but you didn't go out to welcome me, so I had to come to you in person. The new talent of the Flow Sword Sect is truly conceited, huh?"</p>
