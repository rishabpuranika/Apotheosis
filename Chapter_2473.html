<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Looking at the fury in Duke's eyes, how could Luo Zheng not understand?</p>

  <p>As he fell, a sneer appeared on his face and the four swords of the Gods Killing Sword Array materialized next to him.</p>

  <p>He had spent most of his time comprehending and using the Truth of Divine Dao during the two years of cultivation.</p>

  <p>He then found that the Truth of Cultivation Nature was a lot different from the other Truths of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Cultivation Nature was practically compatible with any token, including the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>The four invisible long swords then flew and shot towards Duke.</p>

  <p>In this way, he had already made a small breakthrough in Joy's Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>However, Joy had also felt that the Gods Killing Sword Array used with the Truth of Cultivation Nature was more powerful and had fewer flaws.</p>

  <p>After figuring out this, Joy was also working hard on the potential of the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>According to her, he might be able to create an array with more changes.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>All four swords shot down as Duke drew a long sword with a wide blade.</p>

  <p>However, just as he brandished the long sword, the leading Buddha Emperor Sword struck towards him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword collided with Duke's blade.</p>

  <p>Even though Duke was a top-rank True God, he was still unable to resist the killing power of the Buddha Emperor Sword. The long sword almost flew out of his hand.</p>

  <p>He stepped back in an attempt to retreat but he suddenly felt shackles on the lower part of his body.</p>

  <p>"Long Vine Sword!"</p>

  <p>The four swords were controlled by the Truth of Divine Dao and all of them moved and worked together seamlessly.</p>

  <p>That was the terrifying nature of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>It made everything natural and harmonious.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Tooth Sword!"</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Tooth Sword suddenly hacked at Duke's neck.</p>

  <p>But Duke leaned back and managed to avoid a horrible gash in his throat.</p>

  <p>The attack didn't leave him unscathed though, and he now had a shallow cut on his neck.</p>

  <p>After taking continuous blows, Duke finally broke free from the Long Vine Sword and quickly scurried backwards.</p>

  <p>In just a few minutes, Duke had already suffered so much.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think of yourself as my opponent?"</p>

  <p>Duke asked with a trace of arrogance, his previous hesitation and forbearance disappearing within a second.</p>

  <p>Now that Duke decided to go all out, he could take any risk.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>An ugly cut on Duke's wrist caught Luo Zheng's attention.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a handful of bright red blood spurted from the wound.</p>

  <p>It was dripping blood, but before any of it could fall on the ground, it converged in the air and condensed into a long narrow sword.</p>

  <p>"A blood sword?" Luo Zheng's face was calm as he raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The whole sword was made of Duke's blood.</p>

  <p>Such a method looked mysterious but it might not be too powerful.</p>

  <p>"Blood Cursing Sword!"</p>

  <p>Streaks of red light shot out of the blood sword.</p>

  <p>The blood sword was burning.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>The price of using the Blood Cursing Sword was a high and horrible one.</p>

  <p>It burned the blood essence and cursed one's body bringing irreparable damage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng snorted.</p>

  <p>The four airborne swords circled and attacked Duke once again.</p>

  <p>With a little stir of Duke's long sword, the nauseating stench of blood met everyone's noses.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes twitched as he watched the four swords dissipate after touching the blood sword.</p>

  <p>It looked like Duke was stronger than he thought.</p>

  <p>But it didn't matter.</p>

  <p>From the beginning, the means used by Duke all came at a great price.</p>

  <p>For one thing, it was almost impossible for Duke to climb to the height of nine hundred and twenty feet by his own strength, and had only made it with the Energy-extracting Needles, Tyrone, Ellis, and the True Gods of the alliance of wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>All of them had lost their fighting power and were now lying motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>Under the crazy flame of the blood sword in front of him, Luo Zheng grinned a sinister smile. "The blood essence is burning wildly."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, I shall kill you before my blood essence is totally burnt out!" With that, Duke rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng had no need to fight him head on.</p>

  <p>Seeing Duke rushing over, Luo Zheng touched the ground with the tip of his toe and hurried backward.</p>

  <p>"Coward!"</p>

  <p>Duke was not afraid of fighting Luo Zheng but he was afraid that Luo Zheng would run off without a fight.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng had said, the Blood Cursing Sword was indeed powerful.</p>

  <p>Any living being that was cut by the blood sword would collapse no matter how powerful that person's body was.</p>

  <p>The blood sword, after all, was an extremely powerful "curse".</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng's four swords weren't living creatures, they weren't exempt from the blood sword's effects.</p>

  <p>"Coward? If I don't retreat now, I'll be a reckless man." Luo Zheng replied simply.</p>

  <p>He wasn't a three-year-old kid. If Duke hoped to get under his skin with his taunting, then he was too naive.</p>

  <p>It went on like that, with Luo Zheng constantly blocking Duke's attacks. If one of the swords was crushed by Duke, Luo Zheng merely condensed it out again.</p>

  <p>A steady stream of swords were condensed by Luo Zheng, constantly circling around Duke. The distance between the two could never close.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Duke thought of how it would be had he led the members of the alliance to attack. Their chances of winning wouldn't be as small as it was now.</p>

  <p>After all, Tyrone and the others were not much weaker than Duke.</p>

  <p>After all, there were only two powerful people in the Sword Clan, Reinhard and Yan.</p>

  <p>But the top figures of the alliance of the wealthy clans were all sucked up by Duke with the Energy-extracting Needles, so their fighting capacity was naturally greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, the disciples of the Sword Clan cooperated so well with each other and even had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Of course, Yan's attack was also very crucial.</p>

  <p>Although Yan didn't want to fight those wealthy clans' disciples face to face, the token she cultivated was extremely powerful. Once she used it, she would definitely take one opponent's life.</p>

  <p>All she needed was to cast one spell, "Die".</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was fleeing backward, calm and cool as ever.</p>

  <p>However, the look on Duke's face had darkened, and the red flame on the blood sword in his hand was becoming dimmer and dimmer.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng guessed, the method of burning the blood essence wouldn't last long.</p>

  <p>Duke was getting weaker and weaker, and he finally stopped and panted with the blood sword clenched tightly in his fist. He looked at Luo Zheng, feeling desperate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still looked at Duke indifferently and said, "You should give up. You have done enough for your Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>"Give up..." Duke spat bitterly.</p>

  <p>It shouldn't have been like this.</p>

  <p>Before setting out, Duke had heard about Luo Zheng from Rachelle.</p>

  <p>She said that they probably wouldn't be able to kill Luo Zheng and at that time, Duke did not understand.</p>

  <p>But now, he finally did.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, a loud sound of footsteps suddenly came from the distance, and a huge figure appeared in the mist.</p>

  <p>Looking at the figure, Duke suddenly smiled.</p>
