<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2398 Non-combat Zone </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Originally, the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos was written by Bromley by using backstepping based on his own knowledge and experience.</p>

  <p>He had deciphered the middle part of the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos according to some golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>But since not every word of this part was a hundred percent correct, the Truth of Godly Way contained within it was greatly weakened.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Truth of Cultivation Nature, which Luo Nian previously deciphered, was a complete text. With his natural talent for interpreting great texts, the power of the Truth of Cultivation Nature that he had cracked was horrifying.</p>

  <p>Now, as if bewitched, Hallet and Augustus continued to read the words written by Luo Nian one by one, and their eyes hung onto the tip of Luo Nian's brush, not willing to stop at all.</p>

  <p>Yudie's face was filled with a mixture of pride and relief when she saw this.</p>

  <p>Before, when Immortal Book had talked about the value of the golden Sanskrit words and about Luo Nian's great talent in deciphering them, Yudie had had her doubts.</p>

  <p>Although she had been happy to hear those words, she had wondered if Immortal Book was overestimating her son or playing up his abilities.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Nian was still a little boy. Even if he was talented, how could he have made such exaggerated achievements all of a sudden?</p>

  <p>Not to mention that in her eyes, True Gods like Hallet and Augustus were far superior.</p>

  <p>Even if she thought that Supreme Lords were extremely powerful, they were nobodies when compared to the True Gods. So, this situation hadn't made sense to her at all.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had come back to the fairy palace with Joy, Yudie had noticed the two of them paying a lot of attention to the words on the paper deciphered by Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>After that, when she had been in bed with him, she had asked him how powerful Joy was.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had told her that there were countless True Gods in the divine land and yet Joy was someone that all the True Gods looked up to.</p>

  <p>But this woman, whom all the True Gods admired, had been reading something written by Luo Nian for half a month. How could Yudie not be proud of her son?</p>

  <p>Now, another two disciples of Luo Zheng's master had suddenly shown up at the fairy palace. The two warriors were strange but the power they exuded didn't seem to be much less than Joy's. And these warriors were also stunned by the words written by Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Immortal Book hadn't been talking nonsense after all? the mind method of this Truth of Godly Way was more important than Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>'But for me, my child and my husband are the most important, ' Yudie thought as she looked at Luo Zheng and Luo Nian in silence.</p>

  <p>A short while later, Luo Nian had written a thousand more words.</p>

  <p>Soon, both Hallet and Augustus met a bottleneck just like Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>They found the words increasingly difficult to recite as the Truth of Godly Way hidden in them was constantly impacting their souls.</p>

  <p>Hallet, who had excellent talent and a refined cultivation base, had already read more than 1, 400 words.</p>

  <p>He looked like a man who was able to persevere and complete any task.</p>

  <p>However, one of his greatest strengths was knowing when to advance and when to retreat. He knew that comprehending the Truth of Godly Way wasn't something that could be forced, so he paused.</p>

  <p>Augustus, on the other hand, continued reading those words with clenched teeth and a pained expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Shocked by the look on Augustus's face, Luo Nian stopped for a moment.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Augustus with concern, and then continued.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, while Augustus continued reading the words, the soul pressure he was exuding gradually increased. His long and messy hair began to flutter in the wind, and a word was about to appear between his eyebrows. It seemed that he had lost control over himself.</p>

  <p>If the full soul pressure of a consummate True God was fully activated, Yudie, Luo Nian, Xun, and the several others present wouldn't be able to resist it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Joy looked at each other, worried.</p>

  <p>Joy prepared herself to protect everyone. But before she could take a step, Hallet murmured, "This idiot has lost his mind again!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he waved the fishing rod in his hand and gave a sharp tap on the word on Augustus' forehead. It seemed that he was used to using more violent means.</p>

  <p>Bang! A loud sound resonated through the side hall.</p>

  <p>The impact of the fishing rod knocked Augustus to the floor, and he passed out. Then, Hallet dragged him out of the hall.</p>

  <p>The next day, Augustus silently sat next to Hallet, his forehead still red and swollen. Depression was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, according to our master's instruction, once you enter the Everest Spirit Mountain, we have to return to the Swirl Forest and try to find a way to become the controllers of this forbidden area," said Hallet, fixing his eyes on Luo Zheng. He held the fishing rod with one hand, trying to catch the huge goldfish in the pond.</p>

  <p>"Well, things didn't go smoothly," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>To begin with, Joy had never been a part of Mike's plan as he hadn't wanted her to get involved in this matter. He had only hoped that she could help Luo Zheng while he was in the divine land. However, he hadn't expected things to develop the way they did in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Contrary to Mike's plan, Luo Zheng hadn't been able to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain and he'd had to return to the fairy palace with Joy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what Holy Mike has planned next. What about you?" asked Hallet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and his shoulders drooped in dejection. He didn't know his father's arrangements either.</p>

  <p>It was said that spectators saw the most of the game. Luo Zheng was the leading man of Mike's arrangements, and yet he knew the least.</p>

  <p>This had happened all the time during his time in the Evolutionary Universe. Luo Zheng had known less about his father's plan than even Tianming.</p>

  <p>He had thought that things would change in the divine land. But even though he now had some sort of guidance, he still felt like a headless chicken dashing around.</p>

  <p>Perhaps things hadn't gone according to plan was because his father didn't have as much control over the divine land as he had over the universe. Whatever it was, Luo Zheng had been unable to smoothly enter the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>"With all due respect, although Holy Mike is miraculous and his Evolution Godly Way is amazing, he can't accurately predict every single thing that occurs in the divine land. There are countless variables, after all," said Hallet without any hesitation. He had a thorough understanding of the current situation. "Judging by the date you entered the divine land, I think his plan was logical and reasonable. It was right around the time when the True Gods were fighting over the rankings of the Floating Islands and the Time Sea Forbidden Land was about to open."</p>

  <p>Just then, his fishing rod shook slightly before drooping down at the end.</p>

  <p>A fish was hooked.</p>

  <p>Hallet gently flicked the fishing rod and a big carp flew out of the water.</p>

  <p>Then, with another flick of his fishing rod, he threw the carp back into the pond. After that, he added, "If I were Harold, waiting for you in the Everest Spirit Mountain, I would definitely take you somewhere important.</p>

  <p>I would take you to a place that was either holding or about to hold an activity. Considering that, it's not that hard to guess Holy Mike's plan.</p>

  <p>Harold is supposed to take you to... the Sunrest Tree."</p>

  <p>"The Sunrest Tree?" Luo Zheng asked with a bewildered expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"The Sunrest Tree is located in the west of the divine land; it is the place where the sun falls. It is the stronghold of the Sword Clan and the debate venue," Hallet explained. "There are still two years left before a new round of debate over the Divine Dao will begin. If I'm not wrong, Harold is supposed to take you to participate in it."</p>

  <p>A smile spread across Hallet's face at this moment. "Maybe Harold has some Truth of Godly Way to teach you."</p>

  <p>"But your father made a mistake. You didn't go to Everest Spirit Mountain. And what is more surprising is that the Truth of Godly Way decoded by your son is probably more powerful than what your father has prepared for you!" Augustus couldn't help chipping in after keeping silent for a while.</p>

  <p>"Shut up," Hallet warned coldly.</p>

  <p>Augustus fell into silence again. Apparently, Hallet always had a way to deal with Augustus.</p>

  <p>Anyway, Luo Zheng wasn't disheartened by Augustus' words as he was still pondering over what Hallet had just told him.</p>

  <p>All he knew was that there were four divine trees in the divine land and that the Dongfang Clan had occupied the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan, which ranked second among the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, also possessed one of the divine trees? the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>"So you're saying that Harold will definitely go to the Sunrest Tree?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," answered Hallet.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng cared about was not Harold, but Yan.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't make sense. Let's say Harold takes me to the Sunrest Tree, what if Nicholas comes there too?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>A trace of disdain appeared in Augustus' eyes, as if he was ridiculing Luo Zheng's ignorance. He opened his mouth to say something, but after a stern glance from Hallet, he quickly closed it again.</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. The Sunrest Tree is the Non-combat Zone," said Hallet in a calm voice.</p>
