<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1503 Tell A Story (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'Seriously? Ask around? A condition?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was about to put away the Roaring Token when he heard the girl's words. A glimmer of hope then appeared in his eyes and his whole body turned frigid without warning.</p>

  <p>He ended up grabbing the Roaring Token and activated it!</p>

  <p>"So, you're going to lend me a hand?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, feeling a bit enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the best I can do is to ask around for you. There's no telling whether I'll actually be able to find Yan or not," the peculiar girl replied.</p>

  <p>"You mentioned something about having one condition. What is the condition?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again, with his stomach about to be tied into knots.</p>

  <p>Right now, lots of things were running through his head as he tried to weigh things out. What kind of demands could this mysterious girl ask for?</p>

  <p>He would do what he could. The thing was, at the moment, he couldn't really leave this Immortal Mansion. If this mysterious girl would require him to take care of a few things, he might end up failing to complete his mission, which could be quite problematic for him. But he would try to come up with something. This was about Yan. There was no way he would give up that easily.</p>

  <p>After a period of silence, the mysterious girl let out a soft chuckle,</p>

  <p>"There is only one condition. I want you to tell me a story. I'll die of boredom staying here!"</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>The second he heard her request, Luo Luo Zheng quickly planted his forehead into the ground.</p>

  <p>Slowly lifting his head up from the floor, he was at sixes and sevens whether he should laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>With another shrug of her shoulders, Xun flatly remarked, "As I've said before, this woman is stupid."</p>

  <p>But it wasn't just Luo Luo Zheng who had no idea if he should laugh or cry. Apart from him, there were also over a hundred Supreme Lords, several hundred thousand world lords, and the trillions of living and breathing beings within this universe.</p>

  <p>"A little storytelling with the Roaring Token. Could there possibly be anything more luxurious than that in the entire universe?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng may be the only person who can pull that off. As a rule of thumb, a Supreme Lord would usually have just a little over a hundred Roaring Tokens. Without a shadow of doubt, they would have probably used up all of their Roaring Tokens already before they could wrap up a single story."</p>

  <p>"That should go without question. She happens to find the perfect person to do something like that. Still though, how bored could this woman really be for her to come up with such a request?"</p>

  <p>Both large and small races alike had been taken by surprise by this woman's bizarre request!</p>

  <p>Little did Luo Luo Zheng know that this mysterious girl was just genuinely getting bored to death from staying in this universe.</p>

  <p>Massaging his forehead, Luo Luo Zheng stopped for a second and took a deep breath. This request might have really been so preposterous beyond belief, but he still managed to pull through in the end.</p>

  <p>Setting aside the identity of this woman, given the fact that she would ask around for Yan's current whereabouts, he was willing to throw caution to the wind and do whatever she said, let alone tell her a story.</p>

  <p>To other people, this might seem like such a challenging request to fulfill. All things considered, Roaring Tokens were as rare as hen's teeth.</p>

  <p>But that was not the case for Luo Luo Zheng, however.</p>

  <p>No matter what, this story needed to be told.</p>

  <p>Lightly breathing in, he paused for a while to prepare himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had started reading at such a young age. And as a matter of fact, he had actually read a substantial amount of good books such as "The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" and "The Legend of Ghosts and Demons."</p>

  <p>And in spite of the fact that it had been such a long time since he read those books, he still remembered how the story went a little bit.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to start, his eyebrows became deeply knit. Even though he still had the gist of how the story should go, he would still have a bit of a hard time recounting the tale from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Because after all, he had ventured into the road of martial arts at such a young age. And as soon as that happened, he just didn't have the time to read these works of fiction anymore.</p>

  <p>'Wait a second!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face seemed to have lightened up.</p>

  <p>He might not be able to depend on his memories, but he remembered that he still possessed the memories of the great world.</p>

  <p>That orb of memories consisted of all the memories of the entire great world. Using these memories, he would be able to easily search for some good stories.</p>

  <p>As soon as this thought popped up in his mind, memories of these stories began surging toward him like a tidal wave. With the size of the great world he had come from, it was a given that there were a great many stories which even Luo Luo Zheng had never read or heard of.</p>

  <p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that the story that was being passed on the most from generation to generation in the great world he was from was also the most well-known.</p>

  <p>The story was entitled "The Heroic Wife." He ultimately decided to pick that one.</p>

  <p>Upon activating the Roaring Token, Luo Luo Zheng stated, "If you can really help me find a way to get to Yan, then I'd gladly tell you a great story!"</p>

  <p>"Of course," the mysterious girl softly responded.</p>

  <p>"A long time ago, there was a mountain known by all as the Mountain of Lady Yue. At the very foot of the mountain..."</p>

  <p>This story "The Heroic Wife" in particular took place around a millennia ago. It had been widely spread all throughout the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had never actually read it before in his life, and now, he was reading it word for word as he perceived in from the memories in his head. His faint voice could be heard resounding in every part of the vast universe.</p>
