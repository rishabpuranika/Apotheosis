</p>

  <p>"I have never heard that 'Nine Li people' has such a meaning," Zheng muttered, his eyes glinting slyly.</p>

  <p>She nodded and said, "And my name is Lorena."</p>

  <p>One would not call each other XX Li among the Nine Li people.</p>

  <p>But in the divine land, people who knew her name still called her Lorena Li.</p>

  <p>"Lorena?" Zheng was stunned before he recovered enough to say, "Isn't there a river in the divine land called Lorena River?"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't understand the divine land fully, but he had obtained a set of the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River in the Famous Sword Divine City. He knew that the Lorena River was an ancient river in the divine land, and also the longest.</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled, "Because that river was named after me."</p>

  <p>"The river was named after Mother!" Zheng was speechless.</p>

  <p>Lorena's face softened at Zheng's expression. "Zheng, do you have anything else you want to ask me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Zheng said, his tone suddenly serious.</p>

  <p>Even now, a lot of things were still a mystery to Zheng.</p>

  <p>He wanted to know everything.</p>

  <p>"Why did you hide underground, Mother?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Lorena stared off into the distance, a sudden gloom crossing her. "To avoid someone, of course," she said.</p>

  <p>"You mean the Holy Beings of the alliance? Nicholas?" Zheng asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled as she answered him. "Nicholas is half of the reason. As for the other Holy Beings, they are nothing."</p>

  <p>"Really? Nicholas is only half of the reason?" Zheng said, shocked yet again.</p>

  <p>But when he thought about it, he remembered that his mother, in her current state, had been able to kill Edmond, who was as strong as a Demi-Holy Being, pretty easily.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings might actually mean nothing to his mother.</p>

  <p>"Since the divine land was created, I've only ever considered two people to be geniuses. One was your father, and the other, was Nicholas,"</p>

  <p>Lorena said, smiling at Zheng. "Both of them can effortlessly reach the Other Shore Realm using their abilities. In the past, Nicholas could cross the Sea of Truth and he should, by now, have one foot on the Other Shore Realm."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed at this.</p>

  <p>One foot on the Other Shore Realm!</p>

  <p>No wonder Nicholas held such high position in the divine land and had already cultivated to such a level.</p>

  <p>It was said that the skeleton of the master at the Other Shore Realm of the debate venue was so powerful that just the Truth of Godly Way that his bones emitted was extremely powerful. So what would happen if a really strong warrior at the Other Shore Realm arrived? How terrifying would it be?</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that your father was so impulsive in the past," said Lorena, who looked like she was missing Mike. "He is so much more talented than Nicholas. If he hadn't died, he might have reached the Other Shore Realm by now."</p>

  <p>Zheng fell silent.</p>

  <p>It was an established fact that his father had died.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Evolutionary Universe was still intact and Zheng had a chance to bring his father back to life.</p>

  <p>Mother, on the other hand, had been hiding deep underground and never showed up.</p>

  <p>There was also only one head left.</p>

  <p>He was their son. How could he tolerate this?</p>

  <p>Zheng's shoulders slumped as he watched Yan sleeping soundly in his arms.</p>

  <p>Only then did Zheng understand why Wynn, Master Feng, and Tianming hadn't told him the truth when he had been in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Even when he had seen Harold and Yan in the divine land, they had hidden the truth from him.</p>

  <p>Things were about to become really tough for him.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Lorena said.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at his mother, doubt clouding his eyes.</p>

  <p>"This is a heavy burden. I haven't been a good mother," Lorena said, her head bowing with guilt.</p>

  <p>She was a sensitive person and she knew what was going through Zheng's mind at the moment.</p>

  <p>No one wanted their children to go through such difficult times just to save themselves.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows went up at this. He looked at Lorena and said, "How can I bear to stand myself if I cannot save my parents when they are in trouble?"</p>

  <p>Lorena was stunned at the bite in Zheng's voice and the seriousness etched on his face.</p>

  <p>She looked intently at him for a long time before saying in a gratified tone, "My Zheng. You've really grown up!"</p>

  <p>She smiled sweetly at Zheng and her smile made her look years younger.</p>

  <p>Her appearance and mentality was such; she didn't look like a mother.</p>

  <p>The two walked side by side. Zheng no longer pursued the topic, afraid that his mother would blame herself again.</p>

  <p>But he had to know something that was of utmost importance to him.</p>

  <p>"Mother, there's still something that I'm curious about," he said.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Lorena asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment before saying, "The day I entered the underground cave of the Tie Clan, what was the monster that looked like a huge chunk of mud?"</p>

  <p>He was stuck in being a low-rank True God, and even though he had done everything he could, he was still unable to improve his cultivation base.</p>

  <p>The only thing that could enable him to condense the Godly Tile was the mud, which meant that all his hopes rested on it.</p>

  <p>"It's not mud, Zheng. It's a Spiritual Darkness," answered Lorena. "Why do you ask this?"</p>

  <p>"That's called Spiritual Darkness? My cultivation stopped at the level of the low-rank True God. Back then, I had finally managed to condense the Godly Tile using the Spiritual Darkness. But now, I just can't seem to improve my cultivation. I wonder if this is the problem," Zheng answered honestly.</p>

  <p>"You used the Spiritual Darkness to condense the Godly Tile?" Lorena asked, shocked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, "Yes. Because of the Primal Chaos Technique given by my master, my inner world..."</p>

  <p>"Primal Chaos Technique?! They really dare!" Lorena said angrily, her voice rising with each word.</p>

  <p>Even Reinhard and the others, who were thousands of feet away behind them, heard her and looked at her strangely.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng looked curiously at his mother, unable to understand the reason behind her vehement reaction.</p>

  <p>"And you created the inner world, absorbed the Spiritual Darkness, and successfully condensed the Godly Tile?!" Lorena said excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng nodded again.</p>

  <p>"How many Sanskrit words have you formed in your inner world?"</p>

  <p>Lorena persisted in her questions.</p>

  <p>"1080 golden Sanskrit words," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"1080!"</p>

  <p>Lorena stared at Zheng, shocked. "Bromley was so crazy that he dared give you the Primal Chaos Technique! You also dared cultivate it, and you have mastered it!"</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips and said, "It is truly painful to cultivate this."</p>

  <p>He had once been tortured so much that he could not help feeling pain dart through him at the thought of it.</p>

  <p>"The Primal Chaos Technique that Bromley created is actually a special method that had never appeared before. I didn't expect it to really work.</p>

  <p>What's more, it's the Thousand Sanskrit Land! Did your father even think of that?" Lorena wondered, still looking confused.</p>
