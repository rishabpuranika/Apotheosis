  <p>
</p>

  <p>The space channel that Emily created shot towards the Murphy Universe from above.</p>

  <p>It went straight down and pierced through the entire Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>As the controller of the Murphy Universe, Murphy had a very keen perception of his own universe. He could clearly detect the fluctuations happening within the Space Law.</p>

  <p>As a Holy Being, he was able to build such a long space channel but he was unable to build such a stable one.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this space channel came from the periphery of the Murphy Universe which was also outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>Who created this space channel?</p>

  <p>With this thought, Murphy turned into an incarnation and appeared in his universe to investigate further.</p>

  <p>Right in front of his eyes was an invisible space channel penetrating downwards.</p>

  <p>"The space channel is trying to enter the divine land through the Murphy Universe." Murphy's face revealed a look of pondering as he sneered,</p>

  <p>"No matter who you are, it's absolutely impossible for you to pass through the Murphy Universe without my permission! I will crush your space channel to pieces!"</p>

  <p>He then pinched the space channel.</p>

  <p>Everyone was a god in their own inner worlds. They were invincible, omniscient, and omnipotent.</p>

  <p>As he pinched, the invisible space channel immediately broke down and collapsed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Emily who was at the top of the divine land frowned and snorted, "It seems like a so-called Holy Being saw what I was doing and destroyed my space channel."</p>

  <p>"Like Zheng said, since the universes are the inner worlds of Holy Beings, we need to bypass them," a powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm advised.</p>

  <p>They could easily bypass these universes and create other space channels.</p>

  <p>Emily raised her chin as she said arrogantly, "No!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she was done speaking, she gently waved her hand and a ray of colorful light slowly spread in her pupils.</p>

  <p>An aggressive stream of the Truth of Godly Way began to spread out.</p>

  <p>'It's the Truth of Void Destruction, ' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Void Destruction possessed some powers from the Space Law. Those powers weren't complete but there was no doubt that the understanding of space inside the Truth of Void Destruction was much deeper than inside the Space Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Zheng already sensed the same Truth of Godly Way before from David of the Yellow Emperor race and his master Tyler.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>An even more powerful space wave began to gather in Emily's hand. She then slightly pointed downwards.</p>

  <p>Another space channel was created.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the Murphy Universe, Murphy looked up the collapsing space channel with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>If anyone wanted to create a space channel through his universe, they had to ask him first.</p>

  <p>However, just as the space channel in front of him was collapsing, another one was quickly formed on the same spot. In an instant, it pierced through the Murphy Universe and extended all the way to the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Another space channel?" His face darkened. Like he did earlier, he landed another hard pinch on the space channel.</p>

  <p>But this time, his pinch wasn't enough to destroy it.</p>

  <p>The space channel could be detected easily but it was like a mirage. It didn't seem real at all. He couldn't even touch it, which meant that he couldn't destroy it.</p>

  <p>"What is happening?" A strange expression appeared on Murphy's face.</p>

  <p>There was a space channel built inside his universe but he was unable to destroy it. How could that be possible?</p>

  <p>Unwilling to admit defeat, he tried several times to use his theurgies.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how hard he tried, the space channel didn't budge at all.</p>

  <p>By then, he was more confused than he was before. What was happening was completely beyond his comprehension.</p>

  <p>"Who created this space channel?"</p>

  <p>As a Holy Being, Murphy had the qualifications to leave the divine land and investigate what was going on. He could go outside and locate its source.</p>

  <p>But he decided to just give up without even trying.</p>

  <p>No matter who the other party was, he knew he couldn't risk offending them. He had to report the incident to Nicholas as soon as he could.</p>

  <p>The new space channel that Emily created extended downwards before dividing itself into thirteen paths.</p>

  <p>Although she forcibly created the space channel as a way to vent her anger, she still had to consider Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>If Zheng's location was spotted, he could be in big trouble.</p>

  <p>The thirteen paths were then scattered in various places of the divine land, which meant Zheng could randomly enter the divine land through any of them. By doing this, it would be much more difficult for their enemies to track him.</p>

  <p>"These are some talismans. As a consummate True God, you shouldn't have any trouble activating them. You can use them when your life is in danger." There were three pale yellow talismans in Ramzi's hand, and on the surface of each talisman, lightning constantly flashed.</p>

  <p>"This is the Devil's Blood Pill. As long as your soul isn't destroyed, you can easily reconstruct your body with this." Leopold gave Zheng a red pill.</p>

  <p>"Well..." said Timotheus.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Emily couldn't help but curl her lips. She was about to say something but ultimately decided to keep her mouth shut.</p>

  <p>After all, they were all kindhearted and were just afraid that something bad would happen to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, some of them were not as far sighted as Emily. Zheng would never have a smooth journey now and in the future. At present, Timotheus and his fellows still had clear advantages in strength that could be of great help to Zheng.</p>

  <p>But what would happen when they returned to the Source World?</p>

  <p>In the Source World where there were tons of powerhouses, Emily was just a nobody. She couldn't protect Zheng no matter how much she wanted to.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not reject any of their kindness.</p>

  <p>After he was done with his preparations, he cupped his hands and said goodbye to each and every one of them. "I appreciate everything that you did for me. If you ever manage to get through the space barrier yourselves, I hope we can all meet again."</p>

  <p>He then turned around and stepped into the space channel. His figure disappeared in front of them within seconds.</p>

  <p>Unlike Timotheus, Zheng didn't encounter the space barrier in the space channel.</p>

  <p>The space channel created by Emily was very stable and the speed at which he traveled was also extremely fast.</p>

  <p>Only six hours later, Zheng had already crossed the Murphy Universe and was able to enter one of the thirteen paths.</p>

  <p>Twenty four hours later, Zheng felt his body becoming heavier as the speed of his fall suddenly increased.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The great inertia took a huge toll on Zheng as he crashed down on the ground hard like a falling boulder.</p>

  <p>"Get up!"</p>

  <p>Zheng roared as he tried to fly in the air.</p>

  <p>But the inertia was too strong and he couldn't reverse any of it to fly. The inertia was like an invisible big hand that was pressing him down on the ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he was getting closer and closer to the ground, Zheng was afraid that he would be seriously injured once he reached the surface. He was also worried that it could cause unwanted movement.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed as he suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>He had reached the consummation of the True God Realm, which meant that he could then use the Grand Teleportation without being restricted by the Space Law.</p>

  <p>He then tried to move himself to a higher position.</p>

  <p>Even after doing so, the great inertia still refused to stop and he continued to fall.</p>

  <p>"One more time!"</p>

  <p>As he was about to hit the ground again, he teleported himself to a higher place but continued falling from there.</p>

  <p>After doing this for more than ten times, the great inertia finally weakened until it fully disappeared.</p>

  <p>He then regained his balance as he slowly descended to a low mountain top.</p>
