  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was very clearly written that?Commandment Mount did not have such great authority at the beginning, but with Cloud Sect's development, the interrogation methods were further developed and even modified. In order to improve interrogation of the disciples who violated rules, the?</p>

  <p>Commandment Hall replicated methods?of the judgement hall in the Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>However, there were no rules granting these methods in Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>As a disciple of Cloud Sect, Luo Luo Zheng naturally and impulsively abode by all the rules of Cloud Sect. But as for the rules in the hall, that were nothing he needed to bother with. He didn't care what were they or what disobeying them meant.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man's name was Murry Qin. He was the deputy principal of the Commandment Hall. In all these years, on his trial list, there were over eight hundred disciples.</p>

  <p>Murry Qin was about to lose his temper by the complete disregard of his commands and was about to show Luo Luo Zheng what would come off by disobeying him. But then he thought of what he was told and held back his temper while adding, "All right, suit yourself and just stand there. Do you know why I summoned you here?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't have a clue!" answered Luo Luo Zheng as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>He really didn't know, let alone have an idea about which rule he had broken to be summoned here. Did he miss something, a small mistake or maybe even a big one?</p>

  <p>After participating in the?trial for slaying demons, Luo Luo Zheng?travelled out of Cloud Sect all the time and never returned. Before he got a chance to go to Drizzle Peak, the two inspectors brought him here. Even while retrospecting, Luo Luo Zheng could not find the smallest tiny hint?as to what crime he could have committed.</p>

  <p>With a sly smile, Murry Qin asked, "Hey hey, you sure you really don't know?"</p>

  <p>"No, not even the slightest clue. I have no reason to lie to you!" said Luo Luo Zheng?in an indifferent tone. He did nothing wrong, and he didn't disobey any rules, so he had nothing to be guilty about or even show any remorse.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you don't know, I'll help you jog your memory!" said Murry Qin as he pointed at Luo Luo Zheng. "A few days back, you participated in the trial for slaying demons, but you colluded with the demon and tried to kill Yale Zhuge instead! You nearly murdered?a Cloud Sect disciple. He was your mate and your companion. Even if you suffer a thousand cuts, it will not be enough for a punishment you deserve!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Yale Zhuge's name, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly understood what commanded his sudden presence in this hall.</p>

  <p>"Alas," Luo Luo Zheng could not help sighing. These people really got a nerve.</p>

  <p>Even if they wanted to kill him, they should have made up a better excuse for carrying out their indiscretion. They just shouldn't have said that he colluded with the demon.</p>

  <p>The Burning Sky Empire and the demon had been fighting for over a thousand years. When it came to a collusion with the demon, a human would be too scared to approach. To protect themselves, they would stay away from any topics relating to the demon simply because it would bring genocide and unfathomable wrath to their families!</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was not scared, instead, he was rather calm. Even though the middle-aged man knew everything about the demon, he still tried to punish him. This indicated his urge to punish Luo Luo Zheng with a severe penalty.</p>

  <p>Evidently, someone was behind all of this conspiracy. Luo Luo Zheng thought for a moment, he soon realized who was behind Murry Qin. It was most probably Fren Zhuge, namely Fren the loony.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pulled himself out of his deep line of thoughts as he smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"You said I conspired with the demon, but now the question of the hour is what do you want to do with me?"</p>

  <p>In cold harsh tone Murry responded, "You?committed a serious crime, you should prepare for a genocide. However, I learned that your clan was not involved in it, so you will be the only one to be punished!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng took two steps forward as he stared at Murry Qin and smiled, "Now I'm here, do you want my life? Beat me if you have the strength and capabilities. That was just your excuse for killing me. Save your energy for later!"</p>

  <p>To sentence him to death after just a few words? Murry Qin must be too naive! Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng did not fear anything, let alone the Commandment Hall.</p>

  <p>So without any delay, Luo Luo Zheng blatantly stated their purpose. If they wanted to fight, he would fight but he did not have the patience to sit through their excuses. He had to get back to Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Murry Qin's facial expression changed, he sneered for a second before speaking, "Since this is what you want, guards! Show him the power of the heaven-destroying cudgel. I want to beat him to death!  Luo Luo Zheng Luo, prepare for your doom."</p>

  <p>Just as Murry Qin finished speaking, four men appeared from the back holding four long golden cudgels. That would be the 'heaven-destroying cudgel'. The cudgels were made from a special wood which had a density and strength equal to and probably even more than iron. More importantly, the wood could break through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Even if people were protected by life vitality, the heaven-destroying cudgel could easily penetrate the life vitality and pierce through the flesh, even a nature creature would be impaled and killed!</p>

  <p>Actually, Murry Qin?felt some amount of guilt. The Commandment Hall?had no right to take a person's life, according to the Cloud Sect rules. Only the senior managers of Cloud Sect could sentence a disciple to death. The most he could do was to send disciples to the Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>But since he was entrusted, he had to handle it in any way. Their ultimate purpose was to take Luo Zheng's life!</p>

  <p>If he?wanted to take a disciple's life, he would have to go forward in a smarter manner to avoid trouble. "I can't kill him directly, but I can beat him?to death," thought Murry Qin.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng?revolted against the punishment, that would give them the license to kill him. If not, then they would beat him to death with the heaven-destroying cudgels!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was prepared to fight at that moment. No matter who tried to take his life, he would let them pay the price and there was no exception.</p>

  <p>But when he saw the four men came in with four cudgels, his heart was filled with joy, a feeling so contradictory to what he thought he would feel.</p>

  <p>The last thing he feared was being beaten...</p>

  <p>Now he was at the nature level, and was worried that nobody would beat him!</p>

  <p>In this case, Luo Luo Zheng gave up resistance. He wanted to see what would happen after suffering through the strokes. Would his strength and might increase?</p>
