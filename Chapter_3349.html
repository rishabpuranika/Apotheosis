<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ahmad grew increasingly flustered when he faced the deadly momentum of Xun's sword strikes.</p>

  <p>When two powerful warriors confronted each other in a neck and neck battle, it was hard to decide which one would overpower the other. But now, it seemed it was hard for him to turn the tables in his favor since his momentum wavered compared to his opponent.</p>

  <p>Ahmad should have easily defeated Xun had it not been for her fierce attack.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Ahmad's strength far surpasses that of the woman, but how come he is no match for her?"</p>

  <p>"We'll make a fool of ourselves today!"</p>

  <p>"This woman is crazy. She has no regard for her life. She's cheating!" exclaimed the frustrated direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Nelly and Xun shared the same personality traits, so it wasn't hard for her to understand Xun's actions.</p>

  <p>Overhearing the disrespectful comments of these direct descendants, Nelly retorted curtly, "Every warrior fights with their life on the line in every battle they take part in. If you have never experienced it, you have no right to say she is cheating. It's ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>Only after the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace had entered the Other Shore would they experience this world in all its cruelty.</p>

  <p>Even in the early stages of the Other Shore, they probably couldn't understand it. After all, they would be under the protection of the Oneness Sky Palace's temple after reaching Stage Four.</p>

  <p>Among the many obvious examples was Feng Ge. She managed to pass twelve stages and reach Stage Thirteen without a hitch. Only until she stepped foot in the Dark Region, did she realize what it felt like to have a near-death experience.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Under the heat of Xun's relentless attacks, Ahmad flinched constantly.</p>

  <p>After a while, he stabilized his steps and gained back his lost control. He reached out for his long sword and gave it a swift flick. In response to his gesture, it produced nine sword shadows in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Nine-world Mantra Sword!"</p>

  <p>The Nine-world Mantra Sword was a supreme swordsmanship manual. It was exclusively taught to the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Even the disciples who had just entered the Other Shore could flaunt tremendous power by using it.</p>

  <p>Although Xun had also practiced swordsmanship in her youth, she had been more used to using a long spear as a weapon before she entered the Source World, which was why she had to start from scratch when she came to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>If she didn't defeat Ahmad now, she might never get another opportunity to do so!</p>

  <p>"Broken World!</p>

  <p>Original World!</p>

  <p>Orchid World!"</p>

  <p>Ahmad stood his ground and kept advancing towards her effortlessly. He showed no signs of backing down; his movements were flawless.</p>

  <p>Even though Xun tried her best to land an effective sword strike, each of her attacks was easily deflected by Ahmad. Due to countless failed attempts, she was forced to take a step back each time. She was unable to lay a single scratch on him.</p>

  <p>Watching Ahmad regain his strong position in the battle, the direct descendants began to cheer him on.</p>

  <p>"That's it, Ahmad! Hang in there!"</p>

  <p>"If you win over this woman, they will be forced to leave!"</p>

  <p>"Woman, with talents like yours, you don't deserve what the Phoenix Palace offers!"</p>

  <p>Hearing them encourage Ahmad and mock her in the background only made Xun feel more inferior to him. Her expression darkened as she bit her lip and glared back at Ahmad.</p>

  <p>She had been giving it her all, but she still lacked the required strength to defeat him. Ahmad's swordsmanship was just too flawless to counter.</p>

  <p>"Swift World!</p>

  <p>Crossing World!"</p>

  <p>Ahmad's sword force grew more and more ferocious with time. It was like a monster, slowly opening its mouth to reveal its countless hidden fangs.</p>

  <p>"Annihilation World!"</p>

  <p>He looked up with fiery eyes and slashed his sword at Xun relentlessly. As she watched the upcoming attack in close range, her face began to lose its color.</p>

  <p>"Xun, let it go! Just surrender, it's okay!"</p>

  <p>"It's not that big of a deal. It's fine. We can just leave the Phoenix Palace!"</p>

  <p>Liusu and Nelly shouted their pleas helplessly at her.</p>

  <p>However, deep down, Xun knew it all too well; she would be unable to deflect this sword strike. Even if she tried, she wouldn't be able to dodge this one in time. If the sword were to pierce through her, she would suffer irreversible damage, even if she didn't die from it.</p>

  <p>Just as the sword charged ruthlessly towards her, two fingers appeared out of nowhere and clasped the blade securely in their grip.</p>

  <p>Under the severe pressure coming from the fingers, the blade caved in.</p>

  <p>Cracks resembling cobwebs formed on the edge of Ahmad's sword, and it was crushed!</p>

  <p>Bracing for impact, Xun didn't dare turn around to see who intervened.</p>

  <p>But as soon as she saw the hand that foiled the strike, a longing smile appeared on her face. In an instant, she turned around and embraced Zheng into a tight hug.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Zheng, Liusu and Nelly jumped in excitement and rushed to his side.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you? And how dare you break my sword!"</p>

  <p>His expressions screamed anger and confusion when Ahmad watched his sword get smashed between the two fingers.</p>

  <p>Zheng eyed him up expressionlessly and asked, "Xun, why were you fighting with him?"</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng arrived, Xun had moved into a dead end from retreating continuously. The intense battle between them could by no means be compared to simple sparring.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't like depending on other people to protect her. She didn't want to count on Zheng to stand up for her each time she was backed into a corner. She replied in a calm tone, "Don't worry. It's nothing."</p>

  <p>However, Nelly stepped up and briefed Zheng all about it. "These people want to force us out of the Phoenix Palace. They've been trying to provoke us these past few days!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the explanation, Zheng understood the matter and gave a slight nod.</p>

  <p>"We have all the right to do so. Our Phoenix Palace only accepts direct descendants as disciples. These three women should not be the exception.</p>

  <p>How can they be so lucky as to be allowed to cultivate here?"</p>

  <p>"They even take up resources that are rightfully ours…"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we only have enough for ourselves…"</p>

  <p>The direct descendants lodged numerous complaints one after the other.</p>

  <p>Zheng's cultivation base far exceeded theirs, but they weren't intimidated by him. Besides, no one would dare to touch them as long as they remained in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>However, they were unaware of the fact that Zheng had defeated Feng Ge in this very place just a few months ago.</p>

  <p>Closely listening to their complaints, Zheng nodded agreeably and gave them a gentle smile. He turned to Xun and said, "Since that's the case, let's leave."</p>

  <p>Before coming to the Phoenix Palace, Xun, Liusu and Nelly cultivated peacefully in the Dragon City. However, Feng Ge had insisted on them coming here instead. Zheng didn't value the resources available in the Phoenix Palace at all, so he thought it was fine the three women left here.</p>

  <p>The three women had developed a healthy relationship with Feng Ge over time. Since Feng Ge was away from the Phoenix Place at the moment, they had no reason to stay either, so they agreed obediently to leave with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"So, it's decided. Let's go back to pack up our belongings. We'll leave here,"</p>

  <p>Nelly said as she shot a cold glare at the arrogant direct descendants.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng turned to leave with them, he was stopped by Ahmad, who shouted, "Just wait a minute there. Do you honestly think you can just walk out of here after you broke my Nine-world Mantra Sword?"</p>

  <p>As a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace, he had always thought of himself to be superior to others.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had close connections with the higher-ups of the Phoenix Palace. Ahmad's mother, Lady Jean, enjoyed a high position in the Phoenix Palace, while his elder brother was gifted with immense strength and belonged to the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter even if he had not reached the Other Shore. His status and connections made him a respectable figure in the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>It boiled his blood how Zheng had just waltzed in between his battle when he was about to defeat Xun. Moreover, Zheng had smashed his Nine-world Mantra Sword into pieces. There was no way he could allow Zheng to get away with it all now.</p>

  <p>"Then what do you want me to do? Do you want me to offer you another sword to replace that one?" A smile of discontent appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>In response to Zheng's statement, Ahmad laughed viciously and stated, "Do I look like the sort of person who would care about a sword? You're highly mistaken if you think you can destroy my sword just because you are stronger in cultivation base than me. My elder brother's cultivation base is higher than yours. Does that mean he can crush you just the same?"</p>

  <p>Naturally, Ahmad was unable to challenge Zheng since he hadn't broken through to the Other Shore Realm yet.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a lot tougher in comparison. But his elder brother, Chance, happened to be in the Phoenix Palace at this very moment. Ahmad had already informed him of the situation through a communication token. It would only be a matter of time before Chance made his appearance on the scene. And of course, he was coming to avenge the insult his little brother had to face because of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ahmad was less than twenty years old. In Zheng's eyes, he was no better than a naive child. How could he pay any heed to the empty claims of a child?</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng grabbed Xun's hand and prepared to leave, another person appeared at the entrance of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.</p>

  <p>This man had a dark skin tone, and his arms were long and significantly bulky. His eyes gave the sharpened vibe of a viper as he stared in Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>He stepped into the Heavenly Cultivation Palace and stationed himself in front of Zheng to block his path. There were traces of disdain smeared across his charred-black face as he glared at him. "Which one of these people crushed your sword, Ahmad?"</p>

  <p>The man who stood before them was Chance, Ahmad's big brother.</p>

  <p>"It's him! He crushed my sword! And he's not a member of the Phoenix Palace either!"</p>

  <p>Ahmad blurted out as he pointed at Zheng. He peered over at Zheng's face to observe his reaction to the situation.</p>

  <p>He had expected Zheng's face to turn as white as a sheet when faced with his big brother. After all, Chance had entered the Land of Sword Grief and was a cultivator of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's reaction had disappointed him. He showed no signs of shock as his expression remained unchanged. To address the matter maturely, Zheng spoke in a calm tone, "While it's good to spar with each other sometimes, you should not encourage your brother's behavior when it's wrong. Your brother was about to kill Xun. I had no other choice but to stop him."</p>

  <p>A warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm was naturally stronger than Zheng. His cultivation base and restraint were not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>However, Chance shook off Zheng's attempts to dissolve the issue between them. The corners of his mouth turned into a sinister smile as he said, "The woman you defended is not a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace, so it doesn't matter if she's dead. As an outsider, how dare you stop my brother and break his sword? You must have a death wish."</p>
