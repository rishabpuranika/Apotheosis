  <p>
</p>

  <p>Finally establishing a connection with the blue-eyed girl, Tianming immediately felt her sense of hunger.</p>

  <p>He felt her thirst for power rapidly growing.</p>

  <p>Since her connection with the red-eyed girl had been cut off, she was unable to replenish all the energy her body released earlier. Now she was extremely "hungry" for an energy source.</p>

  <p>Feeling this emotion, Tianming released the internal momentum from his cinnabar field and passed it to the blue-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As a blue light flashed from the girl's eyes, the cold ice flowers started spreading out of her body. These ice flowers were transformed by Tianming's internal momentum.</p>

  <p>Although there weren't many ice flowers that appeared, they were enough to cover both Tianming and her, protecting them from everyone's attack.</p>

  <p>Pascal, who was controlled by Samuel, tried to stab them with his sword but failed. Seeing the ice flowers surrounding the girl again, he had to ask Pascal to retreat.</p>

  <p>Tianming had fully taken control of the blue-eyed girl now. Only the red-eyed girl remained unaffected.</p>

  <p>After the connection between the two girls had been broken, Samuel only needed to make the red-eyed girl release all her energy, and then he could refine her.</p>

  <p>Shaking the Spear of Supreme Harmony to create a space channel to cover Pascal, Samuel drew him to his side, prompting him to look towards the red-eyed girl's direction. However, he was shocked to see what was happening.</p>

  <p>It turned out that while Samuel and that woman fought over the blue-eyed girl, some people targeted the red-eyed girl instead, knowing the competition would have less complications.</p>

  <p>However, the red-eyed girl was now covered by a large sea of red lotuses.</p>

  <p>No one could really confirm what the situation inside was, just by looking from the outside.</p>

  <p>"The red-eyed girl's energy is now limited. As long as these red lotus flowers are consumed, we may be able to capture her,"</p>

  <p>Rachelle, who was holding two short swords in her hands, commented. Her swords began to emit two rays of blood light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Both swords flew towards the sea of red lotuses.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>These two short swords that Rachelle possessed were also ranked at the top among the weapons in the divine land. However, as soon as they touched the red lotus flowers, they instantly melted.</p>

  <p>The Murdering Godly Way's internal momentum contained in the short swords was then transformed into blazing flames by these red lotus flowers.</p>

  <p>The flames became very formidable at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle, let me help you!"</p>

  <p>Murphy shouted, as he came over to help.</p>

  <p>The Mu Clan had already suffered great losses in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Now that Lowell got the True Demon Body, he would be able to help the alliance of powerful clans retrieve some losses. Moreover, if he could help Rachelle get another True Demon Body, it would be an even better ending for the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>After all, the Holy Beings did not really die. They could always be reborn in the universes.</p>

  <p>Of course, many of the consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings died, but the combat power in this stage was of little importance. If the alliance of powerful clans could overcome this difficult situation with the help of two True Demon Bodies and dominate the divine land, they would be able to slowly cultivate new Demi-holy Beings and new consummate True Gods in the future. With that all set, even the other powerful clans would submit to them.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Murphy flew up, a black sword appearing in his hand.</p>

  <p>Before Samuel could realize what happened, Murphy planned to take the True Demon Body out of the flames.</p>

  <p>"Spirit Annihilating Sword!"</p>

  <p>Murphy's long black sword was suddenly brandished. A ray of black light spread out of its blade, cutting towards the red lotus flowers.</p>

  <p>When the sword's radiance touched the red lotus flowers, they began to devour each other.</p>

  <p>By the time the sword's radiance was extinguished, the red lotus flowers became dimmer.</p>

  <p>While Murphy was watching this scene, a faint smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He knew that these red lotus flowers could turn all the energy into flames, and using any other methods to attack would only cause more trouble.</p>

  <p>Like the red lotus, his Spirit Annihilating Sword needed to devour other energy for it to grow stronger. After these two forces had collided, half of the red fire had vanished.</p>

  <p>Without thinking twice, he wielded the Spirit Annihilating Sword to launch a second strike.</p>

  <p>However, a space channel pierced through the distant space like a flying bird after Murphy finished his attack, directly enveloping his sword strike.</p>

  <p>The radiance of the Spirit Annihilating Sword was transferred to another void.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Samuel, his duplicate and the woman suddenly appeared around the red lotus flowers.</p>

  <p>The blue-eyed girl had already been controlled by Tianming. If this woman wanted to leave the Abyss Demon Region, the red-eyed girl would be her last resort. Thus, she would definitely not allow anyone else to control her.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Samuel was also eager to get the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>Seeing these two people approaching, Rachelle and several other consummate True Gods looked scared. They decided to step back and hide behind Murphy.</p>

  <p>"You and your daughter have no right to compete with me. Murphy, get out of my way!" Samuel said coldly.</p>

  <p>But Murphy didn't give in to his request.</p>

  <p>Samuel became awesome because his Spear of Supreme Harmony could break through space. Combined with the girls' ice flowers and red lotus flowers, it became invincible. With its power, other Holy Beings were unable to defeat him at all.</p>

  <p>But the situation now was different. After the connection between the two girls had been cut off, the red lotus flowers became constantly weak. If this continued, the red lotus flowers produced by the red-eyed girl might disappear completely.</p>

  <p>Even if Samuel relied on the Spear of Supreme Harmony, Murphy had the strength to fight against him. Moreover, Murphy knew that Nicholas would help and support him.</p>

  <p>"You are the one who should get out of here." The woman smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>Flicking her fingertips, she turned the wisps of brown energy into many slender short swords.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Samuel's duplicate stood behind her and thrust his spear, making a space channel appear and pierce towards Samuel. As a result, the short swords were sent over through the space channel.</p>

  <p>Shocked, Samuel had no choice but to activate the Spear of Supreme Harmony and fight.</p>

  <p>The two fought fiercely. Murphy felt pleased while watching. He jumped up and floated in the sky above the red lotus flowers, quickly extracting the internal momentum in his body.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Swinging the Spirit Annihilating Sword, he launched another attack.</p>

  <p>This time, the sword attack was more powerful than the previous one, as he was determined to annihilate all these red lotus flowers.</p>

  <p>The sword shot from the top towards the bottom.</p>

  <p>The blade cut through the red lotus flowers below, but suddenly a strange phenomenon appeared.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the red lotus flowers gathered together and burned.</p>

  <p>They all turned into bones. The flames then transformed into blood and flesh, forming a huge fist.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The burning air surged up, instantly swallowing up the radiance released by Murphy's Spirit Annihilating Sword, and smashed against him at the same time.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>Murphy's eyes were filled with astonishment, as he knew that getting hit by this punch might cost him his life.</p>

  <p>As he retreated, he employed many complicated techniques.</p>
