<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fiends in the Abyss Demon Region absorbed countless evil intentions which made their bodies extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>A fiend was the evilest yet most perfect creature ever imagined.</p>

  <p>Countless divine eras had strengthened these creatures and refined their bones, blood, and flesh.</p>

  <p>Through the power of imagination, they became evil and extremely powerful creatures.</p>

  <p>The fiend race represented fear and annihilation. The Faith Energy in the divine land did not turn into momentum but constantly gathered in the forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>It was in the Abyss Demon Region that all negative Faith Energy gathered.</p>

  <p>However, such a powerful fiend was unable to resist the shadow summoned by a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Trapped in the blood-red lightning, Zheng could only gaze wide-eyed at the scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he understood what Yan said when they encountered Atlas. She told him that if she was careful enough, then there would be no need for her to fear a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>If Atlas hadn't come out of nowhere, Yan would've dealt with him swiftly.</p>

  <p>Furious at the scene, Reinhard and the Sword Clan members all drew their Calamity Swords.</p>

  <p>However, eleven people with Calamity Swords were still no match for Edmond.</p>

  <p>It was clear for Reinhard and the others that they were only courting death.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances, however, they did not really have a choice.</p>

  <p>Just before they attacked though, Yan had gone ahead and shocked all of them.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was wild with joy.</p>

  <p>He didn't know just what kind of method Yan used, but perhaps it was possible for her to forge a miracle and kill this fiend.</p>

  <p>Yan had effectively given hope to these Sword Clan disciples.</p>

  <p>"Soul Killing Sword Strike! Kill him!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard yelled.</p>

  <p>He stood at the helm with the other Sword Clan disciples behind him, lined up in two rows with their Calamity Swords drawn.</p>

  <p>Each disciple had a resolute expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>Streaks of crimson light connected them.</p>

  <p>In order to fight against a powerful fiend like Edmond, Reinhard had no qualms in using their most powerful attack— the Soul Killing Sword Strike of the Soaring Sword Sky Array.</p>

  <p>Edmond's hands had been skinned and revealed bones.</p>

  <p>At that moment, eleven disciples' sword array converged and turned into one huge sword shadow aimed towards him.</p>

  <p>The Calamity Swords emitted rays of red light and contained invincible power. Everything was poured into this attack.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The eleven charged forward and went through Edmond's huge body.</p>

  <p>A wound, as wide as ten feet, opened in Edmond's belly as the huge sword shadow pierced through him.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The fiend retreated a few steps back from the force.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yan waved the two slender whips and struck Edmond as she controlled the huge shadow.</p>

  <p>Each time he was whipped, blood poured down his wounds. Several deep marks were left on his body.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Duke had passed out in the huge pit.</p>

  <p>He woke up after hearing loud sounds.</p>

  <p>'Edmond, that fiend, he should've already killed all of them, right?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He stood up unsteadily. The finger strike Edmond shot seriously injured him, and he lost almost all of his fighting power.</p>

  <p>It took him a great deal to climb back up from the pit. Just as he did so, he witnessed the huge sword shadow pierce Edmond's back.</p>

  <p>Reinhard controlled the Soaring Sky Sword Array and made another cut upon Edmond's body.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>To say Duke was shocked was an understatement.</p>

  <p>He saw Yan floating in the air, controlling a huge shadow that caused damage to Edmond.</p>

  <p>This was completely different from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Edmond was an invincible force in the Abyss Demon Region. Not even three Demi-holy Beings had been enough to bring him down.</p>

  <p>Yet here was Yan and a few Sword Clan disciples, beating the heck out of him.</p>

  <p>How was this possible?</p>

  <p>How could this be?</p>

  <p>Duke's state of mind shook violently.</p>

  <p>He had put all his hopes upon this fiend.</p>

  <p>If it turned out that not even Edmond could stop the Luo siblings, then there was nothing else he could ever hope to do.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, even Edmond was surprised at this turn of events.</p>

  <p>Still though, the attacks of Yan and the Sword Clan disciples were fierce, but did not cause him any serious harm.</p>

  <p>A fiend had stellar regeneration skills after all.</p>

  <p>After a while of being pelted with attacks, Edmond let out a ferocious laugh and his eyes flashed red.</p>

  <p>"Very good! You've succeeded in infuriating me!"</p>

  <p>His voice fell and his huge body suddenly became extremely agile.</p>

  <p>He charged straight towards Yan.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a loud explosion as Edmond tackled the huge shadow she controlled, forcing it a few steps back.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Reinhard turned into a huge sword shadow and rushed towards him!</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Edmond turned around and directly smashed his huge fist towards the sword shadow.</p>

  <p>His flesh had already been shattered by Yan's whips so his fist was merely red bone.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was another loud bang!</p>

  <p>A soft wave appeared on the sword shadow's surface.</p>

  <p>All the Sword Clan disciples had been hit by a great force.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Blood spurted out their mouths all at the same time, including Reinhard.</p>

  <p>The attack was shared by the eleven disciples, but it was still difficult for them to bear the attack.</p>

  <p>However, the punch wasn't enough to destroy the array, so Edmond raised his fist once again.</p>

  <p>One more punch and the Soaring Sky Sword Array would certainly be torn into pieces; those who formed it would die instantly.</p>

  <p>This scene gave Duke hope.</p>

  <p>It seemed he hadn't failed just yet.</p>

  <p>"Yes! This is the power of a fiend. Show them more of your power!"</p>

  <p>Duke laughed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Marsh and Gibson in the Heavenly Sword Divine City closed their eyes at the same time.</p>

  <p>The twelve disciples of the Sword Clan, including Reinhard, were all selected carefully, As a top-rank True God, Reinhard was granted the surname "Sword" and was an outstanding figure in his clan.</p>

  <p>Only a consummate True God was qualified to bear such a surname.</p>

  <p>The two Holy Beings knew their disciples would die after using their Calamity Swords, and they couldn't bear to see such a scene.</p>

  <p>Just as Edmond's punch was about to land on the sword array, a majestic aura suddenly rose!</p>

  <p>An incomparable blazing sword light shot out from where it rose.</p>

  <p>This sword light seemed to have the capacity to cut through both heaven and earth. Nothing in the vast divine land could resist it.</p>

  <p>Swiss!</p>

  <p>A faint wind blew.</p>

  <p>Edmond suddenly felt his right shoulder become lighter.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>His huge right arm was cut off and hit the ground hard.</p>
