</p>

  <p>"They have planted the seed of the Eye of Perception, which means that they have managed to summon avatars in the debate venue," Marsh continued. "If Yan has really understood more than half of the Truth of Holy Words, she may be able to summon an avatar of the second class."</p>

  <p>The old man next to Marsh spoke when he heard those words, "In the past, we summoned avatars of the second class but we failed to resist the manifestations of our fears. Although four of us worked together to force our way in, we triggered a restriction and had to retreat. Yan has an avatar of the second class but she may not be able to resist the incarnations of fears."</p>

  <p>The old man was another Holy Being of the Sword Clan, Gibson Sword.</p>

  <p>A helpless look passed through Harold's face. "That's all I can do."</p>

  <p>Because Luo Zheng had gone the wrong way, he tried his best.</p>

  <p>In fact, Yan did a good job.</p>

  <p>Even if the Truth of Holy Words left by Harold's master was incomplete, since she mastered ninety-nine percent of it, she could be called perfect.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng couldn't have done better.</p>

  <p>It was all up to luck whether they could pass or not.</p>

  <p>Harold was very clear that although the beings of the divine land all called themselves gods, no one was a real god. It was impossible for them to control their fate.</p>

  <p>"First, let's use the perception technique to see what happens."</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Tree could block the mind.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even Holy Beings couldn't have an all-encompassing view.</p>

  <p>If they wanted to detect movements in the Sunrest Tree, they needed to use the perception technique of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>As Marsh's eyes flashed, the scene of the debate venue at the bottom of the Sunrest Tree entered his eyes.</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on his face as he was stunned by the scene that he saw.</p>

  <p>It was rare to see such an expression on a Holy Being's face.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Gibson asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Marsh glanced at Harold meaningfully. "Take a look."</p>

  <p>Harold didn't understand Marsh but he hurriedly performed the technique so that he could see if something happened to Yan.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed and then he saw the situation in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>"What? Yan's avatar is Luo Zheng!" Harold's eyes snapped wide open.</p>

  <p>Gibson mirrored his expression. "Harold, didn't you say that Luo Zheng didn't enter the Everest Spirit Mountain and didn't learn the Truth of Holy Words?"</p>

  <p>"That's true," Harold confirmed as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Then, what's going on?" Gibson questioned.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." Marsh laughed. "Don't ask Harold. He only has half of the Truth of Holy Words. Yan has almost fully mastered it so she has summoned an avatar of the second class. Harold, you didn't teach the Truth of Divine Dao that Luo Zheng uses, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Harold with a bemused expression.</p>

  <p>"His avatar is in the top level of the first class. This means that he must have comprehended more than ninety percent of the Truth of Divine Dao that he cultivates!" Marsh's eyes lit up as excitement uncontrollably surged in his heart. "I really don't know how he did that! Does he have a complete text of the Truth of Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"A complete text?" Since Harold wasn't a member of the Sword Clan, he had no idea how they classified avatars and so he was shocked when he heard Marsh's words.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng hid in the Immortal Mansion for the past two years, was that where he got the Truth of Divine Dao? It passed through Harold's mind but he didn't say it out loud.</p>

  <p>There were some things that were too important to share even though the Sword Clan was cooperating with him right now. It was impossible for him to tell them his speculations.</p>

  <p>"He has a good chance!" Marsh was too excited to closely question Harold.</p>

  <p>Even though Marsh thought Yan was most likely to acquire the inheritance, the chance was still not very high. It was just an estimated thirty percent possibility.</p>

  <p>After all, Harold had clearly said that he hadn't imparted the Truth of Divine Dao to Luo Zheng and so, Marsh didn't test him.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng and Yan arrived at the debate venue, the situation changed so much that it was completely beyond all of their expectations.</p>

  <p>In the debate venue, Duke, Gino, Wesley, and the True Gods of the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands all had long faces.</p>

  <p>Duke tried his best to display the Truth of Divine Dao in the hopes of condensing a more powerful avatar.</p>

  <p>Even though the incarnation of fear he set in the mist was strong enough to attack all the top-rank True Gods, he still needed a strong avatar to assist him. The avatar was the most powerful weapon that the debate venue gave him and he would kill the others with it when necessary.</p>

  <p>It took him a long time to condense his avatar and when he finally opened his eyes, he didn't even get to observe his avatar before his gaze was drawn to Luo Zheng's avatar that was emitting a dazzling blood red light!</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's avatar!"</p>

  <p>Duke didn't know the avatar's class.</p>

  <p>Normally, his avatar would be considered good but next to Luo Zheng's avatar, it was like a firefly against the sun. They were on completely different levels!</p>

  <p>"How could this be?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's avatar is actually stronger than his sister's!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>It made Duke grit his teeth and whisper, "It doesn't matter. I don't believe he can break through with that avatar!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods present condensed their own avatars one by one.</p>

  <p>Some of the avatars were in strange shapes and sizes, but the majority of them were human shaped.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>At the signal, Xun, his avatar, quickly stepped in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Xun threw the long spear in its hand and it immediately turned into a red light that rushed out!</p>

  <p>It was as easy as controlling his own arm for Luo Zheng to manipulate the avatar because of his powerful soul force.</p>

  <p>When he saw the current Xun, Luo Zheng couldn't help but think of the time when she was his sword spirit. The resemblance was uncanny but the avatar was even stronger!</p>

  <p>"All of the avatars have been condensed. It's time to go," Reinhard smiled as he spoke. "Luo Zheng, Yan, your avatars are the strongest. Please follow me."</p>

  <p>Taking the lead once again, Reinhard headed towards the mist. Luo Zheng and Yan followed closely behind him with the other True Gods behind them.</p>

  <p>Even when they obtained powerful avatars, the faint shadows flickering in the thick mist still weighed heavily in their minds.</p>

  <p>They trudged forwards for miles and plunged deeper into the mist.</p>

  <p>They looked around their surroundings and found that everything was hazy.</p>

  <p>They all knew that the incarnations of their fears were hidden in the mist.</p>
