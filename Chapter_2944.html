<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2944 Reborn </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Throughout her years of captivity, Nelly concentrated all her attention on cultivation.</p>

  <p>She wasn't too bad. In fact, she managed to become a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Rachelle had previously forbidden anyone to release Nelly, which was why the latter knew very little regarding the outside world.</p>

  <p>The Time Sea hadn't been peaceful in the past few days. The Floating Islands, including the one of the Mu Clan kept rising and falling, leading Nelly to speculate. Something serious must've happened in the divine land, for even the Floating Islands of the various powerful clans fluctuated so greatly that some of them almost fell into the Time Sea at one point.</p>

  <p>Nelly's heart was full of worry. She couldn't help but think of Luo Zheng and wonder how he had been doing after years of not seeing him.</p>

  <p>As these thoughts restlessly raced through her mind, she had an even harder time calming down and focusing on the cultivation.</p>

  <p>However, she couldn't escape the binding force of the Gods Confining Jade unless she reached the consummation of the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>She had nearly reached her cultivation limit to transform from a low-rank True God to a top-rank one during the past few years. Further improvement would require a rare opportunity for her to go past her bottleneck.</p>

  <p>As she contemplated on this, she suddenly heard footsteps behind her.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>Nelly turned towards the direction of the footsteps, her ponytail swaying along with her.</p>

  <p>She was startled to see Luo Zheng appear in front of her. A look of bafflement and then relief washed over her as she exclaimed, "Luo Zheng! You're here!"</p>

  <p>She blurted loudly before realizing that she was drawing too much attention. She immediately covered her mouth, her expression turning vigilant.</p>

  <p>"What are you afraid of?" Luo Zheng asked her amusingly. He couldn't help but find Nelly's reaction quite endearing.</p>

  <p>Lowering her voice, Nelly asked, "Did you sneak into the Mu Clan to take me away?"</p>

  <p>This girl's imagination was wild. Luo Zheng chuckled before replying, "I'm taking you away but not in secret."</p>

  <p>"But...what about my sister?" Nelly asked with concern.</p>

  <p>She didn't understand Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Did he plan on taking her away openly? This was the Floating Island of the Mu Clan!</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. She won't stop us," Luo Zheng reassured her.</p>

  <p>"How can you be so sure?" Nelly asked him.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle is...dead. She was killed in the Abyss Demon Region," Luo Zheng confirmed.</p>

  <p>At these words, Nelly's expression changed drastically.</p>

  <p>Although they quarreled a lot, Rachelle and she were still sisters. She knew that she had good intentions when she imprisoned her here. It was for her own good.</p>

  <p>Hearing the bad news from Luo Zheng was a hard pill to swallow.</p>

  <p>"How could this happen?" Nelly asked as her question turned to sobs.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed. He didn't want to see Nelly like this but she'd find out eventually. After a few moments, he explained to her how Rachelle died in the Furnace of Dark and Light.</p>

  <p>Before her death, Luo Zheng knew Rachelle still cared about her sister. She asked him to release her, no matter the case.</p>

  <p>Hearing these additional details further depressed Nelly. She leaned on Luo Zheng's shoulder and sobbed for quite a while. She began to fall into a pit of sorrow that left her unable to control herself.</p>

  <p>It was reasonable to say that Rachelle brought this upon herself. Moreover, this woman tried to kill him on more than one occasion.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Luo Zheng felt awful seeing Nelly so sad. He gently stroked her soft black hair and said, "I know it's probably too soon to say this, but...it wouldn't be impossible to bring Rachelle back to life."</p>

  <p>Raising her head in an instant, Nelly stared at Luo Zheng in amazement with gleaming hope-filled eyes that were still rimmed red from crying.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng," she began, "you mean to tell me that you can resurrect my sister from the dead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded in assurance.</p>

  <p>Indeed it wasn't a difficult task for Luo Zheng to implant Rachelle's Memory Flame back into her body for the reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Nelly grabbed Luo Zheng's arm suddenly and pleaded, "Please Luo Zheng! Do it! Bring my sister back to life!"</p>

  <p>Nelly was well aware of the animosity that Luo Zheng and Rachelle had for each other. She nearly killed him in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Although she had no clue what happened later, she knew Rachelle too well.</p>

  <p>She would never let Luo Zheng go.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart ached as he stared into Nelly's pale, pitiful face. He smiled before saying, "I can't revive her. She will be reincarnated and reborn but her memories of this life will remain."</p>

  <p>Everything in the divine land was under Luo Zheng's control. He wouldn't fear a woman like Rachelle. He noticed a drastic improvement in her disposition towards him. For Nelly's sake, he agreed to the task.</p>

  <p>The Ruling Slate relentlessly burst out lightning punishment without pause for an entire month before dying down.</p>

  <p>Its stop meant that all the Yellow Emperor Guards hiding in the divine land were slaughtered. Then, Luo Zheng informed Leopold and the other Nine Li Guards of the locations where the Yellow Emperor Guards died.</p>

  <p>They must have brought along quite a lot of things with them since they came from the Source World. Timotheus and the others took this seriously.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't want to have them buried deep in the divine land, so they immediately set out to take away whatever valuable goods remained on their corpses.</p>

  <p>Clement's body was charred by the lightning punishment torment. His corpse's expression was distorted and you could tell just by looking at it that he was unwilling to die.</p>

  <p>Eight months later...</p>

  <p>South of the divine land, Luo Zheng and Iris appeared in the Formless Region. A central divine city lay beneath them which was guarded by a Thousand Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>"It's down there," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Iris exclaimed, "Let's go then!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement as they began their descent into the central divine city.</p>

  <p>The moment they entered the city, the Thousand Commandments Slate was triggered. Just as it was about to attack, a thought flashed in Luo Zheng's mind and the light on the Thousand Commandments Slate dissipated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could control a Ruling Slate. A mere Thousand Commandments Slate was no big deal.</p>

  <p>After he managed to control the Thousand Commandments Slate, he appeared in the city lord's mansion with Iris.</p>

  <p>As they entered, they heard a baby crying loudly from the backyard.</p>

  <p>"You're sure it's him?" Iris asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng replied with certainty.</p>

  <p>Although he knew the newborn baby was Tianming's reincarnation, Luo Zheng still felt a strange feeling tugging at his heart.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you trespass into the city lord's mansion!</p>

  <p>How dare you!"</p>

  <p>They had failed to slip past the guards undetected.</p>

  <p>The leading clan that ruled the central divine city was the first tier Ye Clan.</p>

  <p>Its leader was Carlo Ye, a famous and powerful individual of the northern divine land.</p>

  <p>The Ye Clan guards spotted some individuals sneaking into the mansion and immediately had them surrounded.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Carlo Ye had been waiting at the door of the backyard for his wife to give birth to their child.</p>

  <p>As he heard the shouts of the guards, Carlo Ye's face darkened and he came over quickly. Once he confirmed Luo Zheng's cultivation level, he was surprised.</p>

  <p>He asked in a deep voice, "Who are you? Why did you trespass into the Ye Clan's territory?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered on how to best answer his question. Without warning, Iris spoke up and said, "I've come for my husband!"</p>

  <p>Carlo Ye was confused. He asked, "Who is your husband, exactly? Why have you come here to find him?"</p>

  <p>"The newborn baby. He's my husband," Iris retorted.</p>

  <p>Realizing the awkwardness of her words, her voice began to trail off.</p>

  <p>Carlo Ye began to look at Iris as if she was a lunatic on the loose. She had a beautiful face, a noble temperament, and excellent cultivation. Was there anything wrong with her brain?</p>

  <p>His son had just been born and this woman came out of nowhere claiming that the baby was her husband. This was strange, even in the divine land.</p>
