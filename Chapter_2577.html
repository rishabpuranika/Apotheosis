<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This was an unexpected turn of events for the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Will... Will Luo Zheng die in the Cave of Wildness?" whispered Baldwin.</p>

  <p>The cracks were extremely firm. Forget Luo Zheng, even Wild Gods would be crushed into pieces no matter how powerful they were.</p>

  <p>Although Baldwin's voice was low, the oldest man still heard it clearly.</p>

  <p>"No. The cracks in the upper part of the cave have been closed, but there are still cracks in the lower part. Luo Zheng is still alive. He will not die," he replied confidently.</p>

  <p>But despite his words, everyone was still worried.</p>

  <p>Inside the Cave of Wildness, Luo Zheng could clearly hear the sounds from outside.</p>

  <p>Even though he couldn't move at all, he knew what was going on.</p>

  <p>'Is the Cave of Wildness closed?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>The bone towers belonged to the body of the Chaos Ancient God and could not be destroyed in the slightest. Who would even be able to close the cave?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng closed his eyes as he pondered over this question. At the same time, he slowly absorbed the tenth share of the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>As he absorbed the Wild God Power with Chiyou's blood, he heard a tinkling sound again.</p>

  <p>"What is that sound?"</p>

  <p>Slightly surprised, he released his spiritual sense to scan the small cave.</p>

  <p>He couldn't see anything with his eyes, but everything around him was already mapped in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Blood?"</p>

  <p>He noticed trickles of blood flowing along the bone textures on the wall and converging in the middle before dripping toward the bottom of the cave. It reminded him of bugs crawling out of the walls.</p>

  <p>Tick... Tick... Tick...</p>

  <p>The smell of blood was overpowering and as thick as oil.</p>

  <p>It was coming from the blood marrow in the bone tower.</p>

  <p>In fact, in both the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race, the so-called blood transfusion was actually the transplantation of the blood power into the bodies of other Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>However, the blood marrow came from the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Thick blood marrow dripped down, gradually filling the floor of the Cave of Wildness. In a few moments, Luo Zheng was completely soaked in blood marrow.</p>

  <p>In his current state, he couldn't move or escape.</p>

  <p>The blood marrow penetrated his skin, flesh, bones, tendons, and marrow along the wounds.</p>

  <p>By right, as long as Luo Zheng got through the Marrow Damaging Tribulation, his body was supposed to be changed completely. At the same time, the Nine Li Wild Body would emerge in his brand new body.</p>

  <p>However, as the blood marrow penetrated his body, he found that his body was beginning to crack again, and the power of this crack was ten times stronger than it had been moments ago.</p>

  <p>In other words, the Body Tribulations would repeat.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Luo Zheng felt like weeping but he had run out of tears.</p>

  <p>Outside the Cave of Wildness, however, the oldest man was not anxious at all. He was calmly walking around the closed cave.</p>

  <p>The faces of some people, including Ramzi and Leopold, darkened.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Adele and Giacomo, although upset, were not as sad as the exiles.</p>

  <p>Adele and the others were, after all, born in this world and they knew that Chiyou was a great man, but they had a natural sense of alienation from the Source World.</p>

  <p>If anything happened to Luo Zheng, the worst outcome Adele could think of was the Nine Li race being defeated in the battle with the Yellow Emperor race. This would be a huge loss, but she would be able to accept it.</p>

  <p>However, the oldest man, Ramzi, and Leopold knew something about the Source World through Luo Zheng, and they also knew about the situation in the divine land. They couldn't allow anything unexpected to happen because of Luo Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>He might be the only hope.</p>

  <p>But now, a baffling accident had occurred.</p>

  <p>As the blood marrow flowed into the Cave of Wildness, the life force in Luo Zheng's body suddenly changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>Ramzi and Leopold turned to the oldest man. Ramzi said, "Look, Luo Zheng's life force has weakened a lot."</p>

  <p>"His life force is fading away quickly," another exile said worriedly.</p>

  <p>These exiles had a stronger perception than Luo Zheng. Even though the Cave of Wildness was closed, they were still able to use their spiritual senses, so they could observe the changes in Luo Zheng's body clearly.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>The oldest man stepped on the cracks of the Cave of Wildness with an unyielding expression on his wrinkled face. "All of you get out of the way!" he said in a thundering voice.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to open the cave?" Ramzi asked.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng can't die." The oldest man's eyes flashed with a hint of determination. "Get out of my way!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As he roared, he released a terrible soul pressure in all directions.</p>

  <p>The oldest man was an outstanding five-star Nine Li Guard, and he was second only to the 81 mages. Without doubt, the power he was unleashing was too great for anyone to go up against.</p>

  <p>All the exiles, Adele, Giacomo, and many Wild Gods scattered at his command.</p>

  <p>Then, they saw the oldest man's body expand to a height of 30, 000 feet.</p>

  <p>Ever since the exiles had come to this world, they had also practiced the Wild God system. The oldest man had grown to a height of 30, 000 feet because the most high cave here was only 30, 000 feet tall.</p>

  <p>He leaned forward and bent over, holding the cave with his huge hands.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The strong Wild God Power in his body exploded in an instant.</p>

  <p>At the same time, many blood lines appeared on his arms. These blood lines didn't emit the Wild God Power, but the aura of chaotic energy. It was a technique that could only be found in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Everyone nervously watched the scene in front of them unfold. As the strongest person amongst the group of exiles, would the oldest man actually be able to destroy a small bone of the Chaos Ancient God if he went all out?</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The blue veins on the oldest man's arms were exposed.</p>

  <p>Although everyone was standing far away, they could feel slight tremors on the ground that were spreading out from the oldest man's hands; that was how much power he was unleashing.</p>

  <p>"How powerful is he?" Elsa asked, sniffling.</p>

  <p>This was the first time Elsa was seeing the oldest man unleash his powers, and she was completely taken aback.</p>

  <p>His old and seemingly powerless hands now looked like they could tear everything apart.</p>

  <p>"Their strength is different from ours. Their powers aren't based on the Wild God system, but on the True God system," Romeo explained calmly.</p>

  <p>"No matter what kind of master he is, it's incredible that he's gained so much strength," said Elsa while shaking her head.</p>

  <p>But after a few seconds, the Cave of Wildness still remained motionless in the oldest man's hands.</p>

  <p>Spitting out a mouthful of stale air, the oldest man finally chose to stop.</p>

  <p>His wrinkled face looked even more haggard and his voice was a bit hoarse as he said, "I was too naive. I shouldn't have tried to break the bone of the Chaos Ancient God."</p>
