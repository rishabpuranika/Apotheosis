<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1448 A Seed Of The World Tree </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>At the top of the giant cave, there was a small crack. And there was a sere grass vine tumbling out from that crack. Its withered leaves were mere remnants growing against the shriveled stem.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about this dried vine itself, but there was an extraordinary tree seed hanging on its tail. The seed was the size of a thumb and bright yellow all over. And its surface was extremely smooth.</p>

  <p>It was unknown how many years it had been hanging there, balanced between the heavens and the lands beneath.</p>

  <p>Everyone was, however, engrossed in looking at numerous strange flowers and herbs in the cave. And because the seed was far away from them, nobody had noticed the small, shiny treasure.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the loud, excited shout of a warrior attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>All sorts of exotic flowers and herbs could be seen in this cave, causing everyone's eyes to water with zeal. Apart from Zheng and Lincoln, most of the other warriors were from the three tenth grade sacred places of the Dark World.</p>

  <p>The resources in the Dark World were scarce, so they didn't see as many rare treasures as the warriors from the thirteen palaces did. Every rare flower and herb in this cave could give them each a great advantage.</p>

  <p>And when they saw the seed, desire burned strongly in their eyes.</p>

  <p>However, the three Saint Lords at the entrance of the underground palace frowned deeply when they also noticed the seed.</p>

  <p>"If I'm right, it's a seed of the World Tree!" The eyes of the Saint Lord from the ogre race were tainted with a trace of greed. He desired the seed as soon as he saw it.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord from the Magnolia Sacred Place shook his head slightly, and said in a regretful tone, "Our cultivation has broken through the Spirit Supreme Realm, and our inner worlds have already solidified. A rare treasure like the World Tree seed is useless to us."</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Demon Night looked unperturbed and calmly said,</p>

  <p>"They are lucky to find a seed of the World Tree, but it's hard to tell whether they could reach it. As far as I know, the World Tree seed has been hanging above the cave for countless years. The underground palace has been opened several times, but nobody has ever come close to claiming that seed."</p>

  <p>The underground palace had been opened six times before. The most recent time was when Xun, the queen of the Demon Night, had entered here. The World Tree seed was one of the rarest treasures in the universe, and she had not been able to obtain it last time.</p>

  <p>At that time, Xun's cultivation base had not been as strong as now.</p>

  <p>Although she had already been the queen back then, she had not been able to obtain the seed, even with the Demon Night's elites to help her. It was a bit unrealistic for these young men to hope to obtain it.</p>

  <p>So for the Saint Lord of the Demon Night, the seed was still nothing more than a shiny bauble in the end, although the World Tree seed was an attractive pursuit for most.</p>

  <p>The three Saint Lords were silent once more, as they waited to see what would happen next.</p>

  <p>"This is the legendary World Tree seed. It can transform into the very foundation of a warrior, and grow along with their inner world!"</p>

  <p>"The World Tree is more than just that. The World Tree seed can store the power of the world. After placing this small seed into one's inner world, it can greatly increase a warrior's strength!"</p>

  <p>"If a tree seed gets a warrior's life vitality sea to nourish it, it will spout, grow, blossom, and bear fruit. Then it will give birth to even more seeds, and it will increase one's strength countless times over!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors were well versed in the World Tree's lore!</p>

  <p>The truth was that up until now, the World Tree seed had only ever appeared five times in the entire history of the universe. And in just these five times, the two warriors who got the World Tree seeds had become Supreme Lords upon claiming these seeds.</p>

  <p>There were many wonderful treasures in the universe. They were classified by usage, and there were thousands of categories of each.</p>

  <p>However, the World Tree seed had one of the biggest differences from the many other treasures to be found. For example, this kind of treasure, which could directly work in the inner world, had a special classification called the "Elixir Field Treasure".</p>

  <p>As the name implied, the World Tree seed was the type of inner world treasures which could work inside one's elixir field. This could give the warrior who claimed it incredible power and talent.</p>

  <p>For a warrior, their inner world was a relatively independent world. After the Soul Sea was opened, it could be used as a Sumeru Space. Many warriors would place their treasures into their inner world for safe keeping.</p>

  <p>However, the inner world was rather frail. Generally speaking, the items and treasures placed within a warrior's inner world would need to undergo a special process first. Furthermore, items like divine weapons could not work inside the inner world at all.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Elixir Field Treasures, like the World Tree seed, were different. They were directly used within the inner world, and anything that could be called an "Elixir Field Treasure", was a very rare find in the universe. Finding such a treasure was the dream of most warriors, yet it was the destiny of few. The World Tree seed was considered a top treasure!</p>

  <p>According to speculations, treasures like the World Tree seed had been passed down since the last grand era. In other words, if someone used one, there would be one missing. The number of seeds was therefore finite. Everyone present could hardly resist such a charm.</p>

  <p>The warriors had all lost control as greed roiled in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Every warrior was eager to get their hands on this seed. As long as they could claim it, the impact on their future would be huge.</p>

  <p>Freya stared at the seed and smiled. She turned her head and looked at Zheng, who was standing beside her, and asked gently, "Zheng... Can you get it?"</p>

  <p>Freya was concerned with who would get the World Tree seed as well, although she understood that it was impossible for her to compete against these warriors. First of all, her cultivation was considered almost the lowest among this assembly, not to mention that they were all the elite talents in the tenth-grade sacred places. She was only a footnote to this historic event.</p>

  <p>However, hearing their heated discussion, Freya also felt some of their anticipation. Accepting that she might not be able to get it, she wondered about Zheng. In her heart she craved the seed on his behalf.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way! Let me go first!"</p>

  <p>At this point, a tall and sturdy ogre pushed aside the other warriors and stepped forward.</p>

  <p>There were naturally formed stone platforms which were connected to each other by a small path at the edge of the cave. The ogre walked along this path, but as he looked at the seed at the top of the cave, and then at the row of stone platforms in front of him, a hesitant expression appeared on his face. This was not an easy task. The path was treacherous!</p>

  <p>All of the warriors present saw that there was a wind tunnel underneath each stone platform. If they jumped off the stone platform, they would certainly be swept into the turbulent winds and streams, and each stone platform would carry one to a different direction. This meant that the fall could end in different disasters.</p>

  <p>Since this Supreme Lord had planned such an arrangement, then there must have been a violent current underneath the stone platform that was also able to sweep a warrior towards the top!</p>

  <p>The problem was there were over a hundred stone platforms in front of him. He did not know which one to choose.</p>

  <p>There were many stalagmites in the cave. Resting on each stalagmite, there were many rare treasures. Whichever stone platform he chose, it was possible that he would be able to get something in the wind blow.</p>

  <p>If not for the World Tree seed at the top of the cave, everyone would have a chance to obtain at least one treasure. They then could all leave in satisfaction with their treasures.</p>

  <p>But now, the other rare treasures were nothing as compared to the seed.</p>

  <p>They were nothing but worthless garbage!</p>

  <p>This ogre was a decisive person. After hesitating for a moment, he clenched his teeth, strode forwards, and rushed out.</p>

  <p>He did not choose a stone platform, but rather decided to directly leap into the air!</p>

  <p>The moment he leapt out, his giant body was sucked into a turbulent vortex. The force of the gale was terrifying! His elephant-like body was like a leaf being swept away in the gale, haphazardly moving along a certain path in the cave!</p>

  <p>"This turbulent current is rushing upwards!" an ogre shouted excitedly.</p>

  <p>The other warriors immediately became anxious. There was only one seed, and if it was taken away by that ogre, the others would not have any chance then.</p>

  <p>However, at this very moment, the turbulent wind that was lifting the ogre up suddenly changed direction and violently swept downwards. The ogre, caught in this wind storm, didn't have any chance to resist at all. He had been only like a leaf floating in the wind, but now he plummeted, falling into the depths of the cave.</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors with good eyesight could see the unwillingness on the face of the ogre. Fortunately, when the ogre passed a stone pillar, he reached out and grabbed a precious fruit from the stone pillar. At least, he had gotten one treasure now.</p>

  <p>Having learned the lesson from this ogre, everyone became very cautious. They didn't want to take any action without consideration and they wanted to observe the turbulent wind's rules first.</p>

  <p>Zheng leaned against the wall, looked at the seed of the World Tree at the top of the cave, and asked, "Is the seed really that important?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, if not, then why did I let you agree to Lincoln's invitation?</p>

  <p>This World Tree seed is one of my goals. You have to get it!" Xun answered in an unquestionable tone.</p>

  <p>"But... The chances of getting it are so small." Zheng shook his head in astonishment.</p>

  <p>His luck was indeed not bad, but it hadn't reached the point where he could accomplish anything he wished for. When he had absorbed the Luck-devouring Snakes during his tribulation, he had indeed been quite lucky, almost to the point where he had achieved what he wished for, but it had only maintained for a short period of time. If he had absorbed a few more Luck-devouring Snakes already, he would have been confident that he could obtain the World Tree seed.</p>

  <p>"Your chances are small, but I have a plan," Xun said with a faint smile.</p>
