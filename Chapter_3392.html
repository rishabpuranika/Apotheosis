  <p>
</p>

  <p>As his hand clutched, Adonis grasped at the flying saber.</p>

  <p>Putting an invisible force on the weapon, his grip tightened.</p>

  <p>But Elvinia took advantage of the opportunity and moved away, quickly putting distance between herself and Adonis.</p>

  <p>When Elvinia saw Zheng, her eyes turned glassy as she practically pounced on him.</p>

  <p>She thought she was done for.</p>

  <p>In the Oneness Sky Palace, she hadn't suffered any setbacks. It was in the Dark Region where she had first undergone a truly terrible thing— her Memory Flame was disturbed. But after she recovered, her struggles were all in the past and she managed to calm down as she digested her memories once again.</p>

  <p>Such memories were truly unforgettable.</p>

  <p>After entering the Chaotic Source World, she wanted to find Zheng immediately and stay with him. In all the time she had been there, she traveled across the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>But she had almost died...</p>

  <p>While it wasn't Zheng's fault, she couldn't help but put some blame on him in her heart.</p>

  <p>Elvinia's reaction even shocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>But it was natural, as she was in a critical situation mere seconds ago. If he had arrived even a little later, Elvinia would have already been cut into pieces.</p>

  <p>Enveloping Elvinia in an embrace, Zheng patted her back gently.</p>

  <p>Adonis held two sabers in his hands, wearing a nasty sneer on his face when he saw Zheng. "A hero came to save the beauty just in time!" he shouted mockingly.</p>

  <p>Zheng pushed Elvinia behind him and uttered coldly, "This is the second time..."</p>

  <p>For a moment, Adonis and the rest had no clue what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>"This is the second time you people have offended me," Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>"First, I was previously attacked by Brylee and Lesly from the Sun Crow race. Now, you intend to challenge me as well."</p>

  <p>Unable to hide it, Adonis frowned at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>As the two strongest demon women among their peers in the Sun Crow race, Brylee and Lesly were highly difficult to deal with in battle.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had encountered them before, he should have already been dead.</p>

  <p>How could he be standing before them, safe and sound?</p>

  <p>"Are you saying you have encountered Brylee and Lesly? Why would they let you off?" Adonis asked coldly. For some reason, there was a bad feeling in his chest.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Chaotic Source World, both the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race took the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace as their prey. It was then that the warriors from these races not only planned to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, but also aimed to kill every single person on the hit list.</p>

  <p>Every time they eliminated someone, their race gave them great incentives.</p>

  <p>Killing Zheng and Elvinia, in particular, would make them garner even greater rewards.</p>

  <p>As for Lesly and Brylee, they would never have let Zheng off so easily— not unless they were in their graves.</p>

  <p>"They didn't." The corners of Zheng's mouth curled into a smile. "They're already dead."</p>

  <p>His answer had the elites of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race tremble as they took a step backward. Now, they were on high alert.</p>

  <p>Zheng managed to kill even Lesly and Brylee.</p>

  <p>If that was so, he had proven himself to be a troublesome opponent.</p>

  <p>But Adonis' brows shot up as he laughed. "Don't brag! How naive of you to think you can frighten us with such words!"</p>

  <p>But Elvinia chimed in, "They were indeed killed... I sensed it with my own blood!"</p>

  <p>The demon women of the Divine Lair could feel each other's existence. But in spite of that, Elvinia didn't take it to heart when she sensed Lesly's and Brylee's death. At this point, she had nothing but hatred for the demon women and hoped for their death more than anything.</p>

  <p>People from the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race knew that the demon women of the Divine Lair had the blood of the Sun Crow race flowing through their veins, and that they had the ability to sense each other's presence. What Elvinia said confirmed Zheng's words. The elite disciples of the two races took another step back.</p>

  <p>When Adonis realized that those from his race behind him were backing away, fury grew on his face.</p>

  <p>To do so in front of their opponents was the greatest taboo. Adonis believed that they must be too cowardly and useless.</p>

  <p>"What are you so afraid of? Elvinia is in Zheng's league. Are you really going to believe her words? Such fools!" Adonis turned to Zheng and said coldly,</p>

  <p>"This kind of person always appears to be tough on the outside, but I bet he is a timid coward on the inside. The more he brags, the guiltier he feels.</p>

  <p>He's bluffing! He just wants us to retreat!"</p>

  <p>But Zheng merely shook his head. "I didn't mean that."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to beg for mercy, now? Haha! I'm afraid that's impossible!"</p>

  <p>Adonis mocked him, laughing.</p>

  <p>At the gate of the Chaotic Source World, everyone could clearly see that Fuxi had done everything to protect Zheng. It wasn't a wise move for them to attack Zheng outside.</p>

  <p>If they wanted to avoid any big disputes or trouble, killing Zheng within the Chaotic Source World was their best bet.</p>

  <p>"No." Zheng shook his head as a sharp light emitted from his eyes. "I'm telling you now that anyone who dares to offend me must die. I will never let a member of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Sun Crow race, or the New Moon race reach the Chaotic Source Realm!"</p>

  <p>His words had Adonis and his group utterly shocked, while Sally, Chaim and Elvinia grinned in satisfaction. They never expected Zheng to be so aggressive and overpowering— it certainly pleased them.</p>

  <p>And it wasn't a baseless statement— he had his powerful strength supporting him. He wasn't merely being arrogant.</p>

  <p>A bad feeling grew worse in Adonis' heart. His instincts told him that he had just offended someone that he shouldn't have.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't just take a step back from his position. Neither his strength nor his aura allowed him to lose to Zheng. But just then, the black smog above the Chaotic Source World began surging once again.</p>

  <p>If the hurricane blew anytime soon, the battle would come to an end.</p>

  <p>A hint of a grin flashed across Adonis' face as he said, "It seems that this battle will have to be postponed. We can then fight in the core area of the Chaotic Source World..."</p>

  <p>Indeed, the wind would soon be too strong for anyone to fight.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the core area of the Chaotic Source World, Khalid and his other companions were also there. With them, it didn't matter how strong Zheng was. He was no match for all of them.</p>

  <p>Adonis sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>The several disciples of the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race were in the same boat.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, Zheng turned his head and ordered, "Chaim, Elvinia, start digging a hole. Wait for me..."</p>

  <p>Elvinia and Hutton were at a loss. Zheng was showing no sign of giving up.</p>

  <p>But the hurricane was soon approaching. What was he planning?</p>

  <p>Sally and Chaim got a clue instantly.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng could freely travel through the hurricane, he would gain the advantage over those idiots and kill them easily.</p>

  <p>Without any more hesitation, Chaim made a huge hole in the ground.</p>

  <p>"Zheng," Elvinia said worriedly, "the wind is too strong. You'll be blown away again. I don't think it's a good idea..."</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy for her to see him, so of course, she didn't want him to leave just like that.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," Chaim interjected. "Zheng will be back." Then, he took the lead and jumped right into the hole, flashing a sinister smile at Adonis and the rest as though he was looking upon dead men.</p>
