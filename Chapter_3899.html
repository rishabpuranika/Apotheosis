<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yan's senses snapped alert at the appearance of the green figure transformed from the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had repeatedly advised her not to show the Energy Shaft to anyone.</p>

  <p>Yan wouldn't agree even if Fuxi wanted to take a look.</p>

  <p>This green figure had emerged from her brother's body, but she wouldn't show it the Energy Shaft without the Snake Goddess's consent.</p>

  <p>"Are you confident enough to strengthen the Energy Shaft?" the Snake Goddess asked as she walked into the hall.</p>

  <p>The Energy Shaft was special, and she had tried every means to strengthen it.</p>

  <p>She had tried to use the ice crystals from extremely cold places in the depths of the chaos, the precious meteorite from the Source World, and all kinds of other special materials. But none of them had any effect on the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>The Energy Shaft was an independent object, barely reacting to the outside world.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't know who this green figure was. Why was it able to give Luo Zheng so much confidence about strengthening the Energy Shaft?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's theurgies were undoubtedly powerful, but even he couldn't strengthen the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>Even if he had absorbed the Civilization Artifacts, it would be impossible for him to do anything to the Energy Shaft, even with the help of the thirty-nine human heroes in his mind.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess posed this question to the green figure in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the green figure replied. "If I'm not mistaken, you used the Quantity and Energy Method to refine the Energy Shaft. According to the energy reaction in her body, the Energy Shaft has now reached the fourth level.</p>

  <p>And you want to improve it to the fifth or even the sixth level. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyebrows shot up. "The Quantity and Energy Method is a method left behind by the Calculation Civilization. I'm not surprised that you know it. I know that there have been many civilizations interested in the Energy Shaft throughout the chaotic eras. But very few people are able enough to improve it to the fourth level, let alone the fifth and the sixth ones. I obviously want to, but I can't do it now."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess meant that since she couldn't do it, the green figure couldn't either.</p>

  <p>"We only made a level three Energy Shaft at the time," the green figure said.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded. A level three Energy Shaft sounded good, but was, in fact, ordinary. Several civilizations in history had made it, but had only been able to control tens of thousands of divine megatons of force. It would be better to train an Eternal Realm master than to spend so much effort on it.</p>

  <p>"But over the years on the Other Shore, we have made thorough calculations and have a new idea to strengthen the Energy Shaft," the green figure continued calmly.</p>

  <p>"Just an idea?" The Snake Goddess glanced almost condescendingly at the green figure.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng hadn't released this green figure, it would already have been driven away. Time was pressing and the Snake Goddess didn't want to listen to its nonsense.</p>

  <p>"Yes, just an idea," the green figure said. "The defect of the Energy Shaft has existed since the Quantity and Energy Method was designed. We neglected one important thing when we designed the method: the position of the Energy Shaft."</p>

  <p>"You designed the Quantity and Energy Method?" The Snake Goddess's eyebrows rose in shock. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"It's a member of the Calculation Civilization," Luo Zheng said as way of introduction.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Yan were taken aback by this piece of information. It was obviously way beyond their expectations. They had never expected Luo Zheng to bring the creator of the Energy Shaft to them.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked embarrassed. She rolled her eyes at Luo Zheng's smiling face. "You brat! Why didn't you tell me this earlier?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chuckled but said nothing.</p>

  <p>When she turned to face the green figure this time, her attitude had undergone a great change. She had become modest as she began to ask some key questions.</p>

  <p>The Energy Shaft involved many complicated things. The green figure began to explain the relationship between space, time, and energy. Luo Zheng found it difficult to understand, but Yan's and the Snake Goddess's eyes lit up, because the green figure had just solved a lot of their problems.</p>

  <p>Not knowing how long this talk would last, Luo Zheng retreated from the main hall and sat on one side, his legs crossed.</p>

  <p>His eyes closed as an avatar materialized in the sky in his inner world, remaining there for a moment before entering the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The last time Luo Zheng came to the fairy palace, Margaret had been pregnant for five months.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been travelling on the Other Shore during this time, which was why he had no time to take care of her. He finally got the chance to visit her after he had left the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>When he saw Margaret again, her slightly bulging belly had disappeared.</p>

  <p>She was holding a lovely baby girl in her arms. The baby girl was sleeping, curling up like a kitten.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but blame himself. When Geoffrey was born, he had not been by Yudie's side. And he had been away again this time when his daughter was born.</p>

  <p>Margaret didn't blame Luo Zheng, though. She knew that Luo Zheng must have met a tricky problem since he was unable to accompany her. With Yudie and Aura taking care of her after the childbirth, she felt at ease.</p>

  <p>She told Luo Zheng that their daughter's name was Salome.</p>

  <p>"We came up with this name together. You can change it if you don't like it," Margaret said softly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face broke into a joyful grin as he held his daughter in his arms. He said, "It's a lovely name. There's no need to change it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strange aura caused Salome to suddenly burst into tears. She began to struggle in Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Margaret picked up the scroll beside her and unfolded it in front of Salome.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the scroll, Salome calmed down almost immediately and began to smile through her tears.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the scroll, confused. On it was just one Sanskrit word. He was stunned.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Luo Zheng would be curious, Margaret explained, "Salome seems to be innately interested in Sanskrit words. Just like Geoffrey."</p>

  <p>When Salome had started to cry and kept at it one day back in the past, Margaret hurried to visit Yudie with the baby in her arms. At the time, Yudie had been cultivating in seclusion to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way. When Salome saw the Sanskrit words, she immediately stopped crying and became quiet and curious.</p>

  <p>From then on, Margaret had used Sanskrit words to coax and mollify her daughter and had been doing it for a few months.</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey deciphered the Sanskrit words, he didn't try to form conjectures about them. He understood their meanings by instinct.</p>

  <p>At her young age, Salome couldn't understand the meanings of the Sanskrit words, but the Sanskrit words she saw were different from those that ordinary people saw.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words meant more in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rendered speechless as he watched his daughter stare at the Sanskrit word with a smile on her face. It looked like she could also see the light dots of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be a coincidence that both Geoffrey and Salome were interested in the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>His children could easily travel through the Abstruse Energy World, but he couldn't. The more he thought about it, the more confused he became.</p>
