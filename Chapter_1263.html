</p>

  <p>This time also, Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of speaking out loud, but the old man still patted him on the shoulder and comforted him, "Nobody can repeat the paths of those who have become legends, nor could they ever predict the path for those who will. No one has the right to point the way for you. Not even a Supreme Lord! But you should remember one thing: even if I don't bring you to the Celestial Position race, and even if your blood is not changed, you are already a member of our race. I believe you will remember the promise you have made in the Tower of Crystal!"</p>

  <p>With that, the old man stood up from his seat and waved the porcelain teacup in his hands as he asked Mu Ning, "May I have another cup of tea?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning smiled and walked over to fill his cup. After the old man drank his third cup in one gulp too, he looked at the Ancestral Dragon roaming around near Xi Youqin's feet and said, "Oh, I almost forgot, we have also decided to leave the Ancestral Dragon here with you. Okay, I must go now! See you next time!"</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng simply kept quiet in response. He was sure the old man would interrupt him again if he spoke.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it wasn't he who responded to the old man's goodbye, but Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>She smiled softly and asked, "Sir, what is your name? Would you mind telling it to me?"</p>

  <p>The old man tilted his head and smiled at her. His mouth moved slightly and a slight, invisible wave of life vitality spread out towards Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>After that, his figure flashed and suddenly disappeared from their sight.</p>

  <p>'Nameless... The old man's name is Nameless. No wonder he told Luo Luo Zheng that he doesn't have a name, ' Mu Ning thought to herself. The old man had finally told her his name through his life vitality. As for Xi Youqin's teacher, she already knew that she was called 'Apeiron.'</p>

  <p>'Nameless' and 'Apeiron.' The couple were quite famous warriors in the entire universe, even though very few people had ever actually met them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at her with curiosity and asked, "Mu Ning, what is the name of this old man?"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's lips pursed as she snorted, "I am not going to tell you!"</p>

  <p>"No, you must let me know it! I am dying with curiosity." Luo Luo Zheng was disgruntled. This girl was starting to keep secrets from him. How could he allow her to do that?</p>

  <p>"No, I won't!" Mu Ning giggled. Her eyes were full of a desire that she tried to hide, but her body was slowly retreating backwards, towards the wall.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng of course wasn't going to let her go easily. He approached her in a single stride and pulled her into his arms. Since she was unwilling to tell him the truth, he wouldn't let her go before she surrendered. After a while, they almost forgot about the name, as a wave of life vitality spread out from Luo Zheng's body and wrapped itself around the teahouse.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning gently placed the teapot on the table, and her body fell limply into Luo Zheng's embrace.</p>

  <p>Nobody else witnessed the joyful times they then shared with each other.</p>

  <p>However, despite their glorious and ecstatic moments, Luo Luo Zheng still failed to learn anything about the old man's name.</p>

  <p>And nor could he find out what the old man had said to Mu Ning or where she had gone last night.</p>

  <p>Despite his curiosity, he had to give up in the end since Mu Ning wouldn't let him know no matter how much he begged her. She had started to become a little mysterious in Luo Zheng's eyes. He wondered what kind of secrets this once obedient girl had begun to conceal from him.</p>

  <p>Did it have something to do with that old man from the Celestial Position race?</p>

  <p>And Mu Ning apparently had her reasons for not telling the truth. In fact, given her way, if she could always stay by Luo Zheng's side without any efforts, she wouldn't give a penny's worth to martial arts anyway.</p>

  <p>But now, she understood that the Lower World wasn't the place where Luo Luo Zheng would stay forever. He would have to ascend to the Upper World someday, and she had to follow him.</p>

  <p>She wanted to give him a surprise. She decided that after he ascended to the Upper World, she would enter the Purple Power World to concentrate on her cultivation, and thus, would be able to meet him in the Upper World too. As for Ning Yudie, she might have to cultivate for about a hundred years before she could ascend, so Mu Ning would be the only woman staying by Luo Zheng's side at that time. This was the happy future she was looking forward to.</p>

  <p>In the following days, besides accompanying Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, Luo Luo Zheng spent the rest of his time cultivating. Half a month later, he stepped out of the Cloud Hall and looked to the east.</p>

  <p>The Eastern Region...</p>

  <p>Four years had passed like a flash since he had set foot on the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>To most warriors, four years were almost negligible compared to their long lives. But Luo Luo Zheng had only been twenty years old at that time. Four years was already a fifth of his past life, and in these four years, his life had almost completely turned around. He had been through a lot during this time.</p>

  <p>"It's time to go back now. It's time to go back to the Clout Sect." He muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>In the last four years, Luo Luo Zheng had travelled without even a day's rest on the way. From the moment he left his home, he had never had the time to rest, and even when he was home, he hadn't had an easy time. And now he believed that he needed to pay a visit to the Eastern Region now that he finally had the time.</p>
