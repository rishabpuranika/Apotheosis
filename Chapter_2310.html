<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Time Sea Forbidden Land had been closed for a long time, and there was a huge amount of divine might coins piling up there as a consequence.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng stepped into the forbidden land, he found an entire mountain of these divine might coins at the entrance.</p>

  <p>Nine roads led to the forbidden land. The road that was activated by the Water Luminous Star had been closed for seventy two years, since the Astronomical Transit Day, usually held every eight years, had been celebrated nine times after this road opened last time. The number of divine might coins that were collecting on the road was truly vast.</p>

  <p>Having just entered, the True Gods could still restrain themselves. They only used their space rings to collect the divine might coins, and there was no scramble to try to obtain them.</p>

  <p>When Liusu saw the divine might coins, her eyes flashed greedily.</p>

  <p>Her body poised, ready to rush forward. She waved her sleeve dramatically. "Take them!" she yelled.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a violent gust of wind blew over the land.</p>

  <p>Some of the divine might coins on both sides of the road were lifted by the wind and flew directly up Liusu's huge sleeve.</p>

  <p>The True Gods, who were picking up the divine might coins, turned their heads and glared at her, shocked and offended.</p>

  <p>They had come to the Time Sea Forbidden Land also to obtain the divine might coins, but there remained rules that had to be followed. If they used their skills as Liusu had done, to collect the divine might coins, they would probably begin fighting with each other on the spot!</p>

  <p>"Hey, girl. You are from the Han Clan, right? I'm warning you! If you continue to act like this, don't blame me for being rude to you," a mid-rank True God from the Tang Clan said condescendingly.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods, too, stared at Liusu with hostility in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Even though Liusu held a special position within the Han Clan, the True Gods who had been invited there with her also possessed considerable power and influence. The majority of them were the core disciples of the rich clans on the Floating Islands. Thus, their status was not lower than that of Liusu.</p>

  <p>Complacent, Liusu just sneered and shouted in an arrogant voice, "I like to collect these divine might coins in this way and what I do is none of your business. What can you do to me?"</p>

  <p>As soon as she had finished speaking, she waved her sleeve again. The fabric lifted up lightly, and another gust of wind blew, funneling even more divine might coins up her long sleeve.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Kelsey and Aleyna exchanged looks of helplessness.</p>

  <p>Liusu was not short of divine might coins. She was from a rich clan and was not in need of any more wealth. It seemed as though she was recklessly trying to flaunt her power before the True Gods, demonstrating her defiant and rebellious nature.</p>

  <p>But she was no longer on the Han Clan's Floating Island. On foreign ground, the elites from the rich clans on the Floating Islands would likely not be accommodating towards her.</p>

  <p>The True God surnamed Tang was visibly furious. His figure flashed, as he charged towards Liusu. He clenched his right fist, and the blood vessels on the back of his hand instantly turned into a black mass, as if there was something viscous and dark flowing through his very flesh.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>"Stop! She is the princess of our clan!"</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey shouted at the same time.</p>

  <p>"I don't care which clan you are from. Who do you think you are?" The True God with the surname of Tang didn't care who Liusu was. He even sped up his pace.</p>

  <p>He was a warrior, one of the new disciples of Clark. With the support of Clark behind him, he felt he had no reason to take Liusu seriously.</p>

  <p>Seemingly no more than a hair's breadth away from Liusu, a figure suddenly appeared between her and the charging True God. It was none other than Langston.</p>

  <p>"Fredrick, these are just some divine might coins. There is still an enormous amount of them on the way. You don't need to fight here, do you?" Langston said calmly.</p>

  <p>When Fredrick Tang saw Langston, his expression softened a little. "If you say so, I will not punish her. But you can clearly see that she is trying to cause trouble on purpose! I will not let her get away with it the next time if she continues!" Without waiting for Langston to respond, Fredrick Tang turned around and left.</p>

  <p>Langston turned to look at Liusu with a smile, looking at her as one would regard a small child who had misbehaved. "This is your first time here, right? There are many conventional rules here. If we see a certain number of divine might coins, we must divide them equally. We all want to collect the divine might coins using our abilities. But we are absolutely forbidden to use our token to monopolize them."</p>

  <p>The purpose of establishing the Hall of Holy Beings on the Time Sea was to set rules for the various rich clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Some of the rules were written on the Ruling Slate, but not all of them were recorded on it, as it would cost a lot to engrave every single rule on the slate.</p>

  <p>It was a common practice for disciples of the rich clans to distribute the divine might coin in the forbidden land, according to set proportions.</p>

  <p>After all, it was extremely dangerous to wander in the forbidden land. If there was a dispute because of the divine might coins, the disciples from the rich clans would fight with each other all day long. This was not what the members of the rich clans wanted.</p>

  <p>Of course, this kind of rule was usually established for warriors with equivalent levels of strength. Killing people for divine might coins was still common in the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>Seeing the figure of a man shielding her from the charging Fredrick Tang, Liusu had been overjoyed. However, realizing that the man was, in fact, Langston, her heart had filled with disappointment. She turned around and looked at Luo Zheng. Seeing him standing still, indifferent to her, made her even more disappointed. Turning back to Langston, she spoke to him with a fake smile, "Thank you for reminding me. It is indeed the first time that I have entered the forbidden land."</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, just follow me. Even the first-grade and second-grade sacred places are full of danger and uncertainty, and many True Gods find their death there. The Time Sea Forbidden Land is even more dangerous," Langston said gently.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Liusu nodded, her voice impassive.</p>

  <p>Last time, Langston had had a big conflict with Liusu. After that, when he came back home to the Leng Clan, his father had taught him a lesson.</p>

  <p>Langston was curious about the attitude of his father, Jeremiah. He was not inferior to Samuel. To the contrary, in terms of clan background and overall strength, the Leng Clan far surpassed the Han Clan. Moreover, it was obvious the Han Clan was trying to curry favor with the Leng Clan by arranging the marriage between Langston and Liusu.</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, Langston became even more confused, wondering why his father was so desperate for this marriage to be successful.</p>

  <p>As an arrogant man, Langston wouldn't act humbly and obediently in front of a woman. But since his father repeatedly reminded him to do so, he had to comply.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, looking at Liusu's sweet smile, Langston felt satisfied and proud.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still with a straight face. Kelsey and Aleyna, on the other hand, were surprised by Liusu's attitude. They knew clearly how much Liusu hated Langston. They couldn't understand why Liusu suddenly changed her attitude and spoke to Langston in a friendly manner.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with Liusu?" Kelsey asked.</p>

  <p>"It seems that she gets mad at Tianxing and is doing this deliberately," said Aleyna, pursing her lips.</p>

  <p>Kelsey and Aleyna turned to look at Luo Zheng at the same time. Luo Zheng walked forward, his face expressionless. "Hurry up and collect the divine might coins," he said coolly. "Otherwise, they will be taken away by others."</p>

  <p>His expression remained cold and unchanging.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey followed Luo Zheng immediately, but they continued to watch him closely from behind, whispering to each other.</p>

  <p>"Do you think Tianxing has any idea?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he is just jealous..."</p>

  <p>Although the two girls' voices were very quiet, Luo Zheng could still hear what they were saying.</p>

  <p>He said nothing, only smirking to himself.</p>

  <p>As for Nelly, she was a little further away, busy collecting the rest of the divine might coins while keeping her eyes on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was annoyed that Langston had suddenly interfered in the conflict between Liusu and Fredrick Tang.</p>

  <p>Rachelle had instructed Nelly to keep a close eye on Luo Zheng. Before Langston so inconveniently stepped in, she had been convinced that Luo Zheng would fight Fredrick Tang. This would have been a great opportunity for Nelly to observe Luo Zheng. The more she watched Luo Zheng fight, the closer she would come to discovering his weakness.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," she told herself. "The Time Sea is very dangerous.</p>

  <p>There will still be plenty of chances for me to see him fighting." After putting all the divine might coins around her into her space ring, Nelly also followed the others to move forward.</p>

  <p>Inside the Time Sea Forbidden Land, there was another strange world.</p>

  <p>The Time Law seemed to be ubiquitous in this forbidden land. The earth under their feet, the high mountains in the distance, and the trees around them were all flashing with multicolored light. It seemed that everything in the forbidden land relied on the power of time.</p>

  <p>The divine might coins were scattered on the two sides of the road activated by the Water Luminous Star. Many of the True Gods kept stopping along their way to collect these divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng naturally wouldn't let go of this opportunity either. Along the way, he had himself pick up around three thousand divine might coins. Even for the disciples from rich clans on the Floating Islands, three thousand divine might coins was a huge sum of money. Some True Gods might have accumulated over ten thousand divine might coins along the way.</p>

  <p>As for the consummate True Gods, such as Rachelle and Alfredo, they didn't even bother to pick up the divine might coins. After entering into the forbidden land, they flew away immediately. Obviously, they were looking to find something more important than just divine might coins.</p>

  <p>No wonder all the powerful and rich clans attached great importance to the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>When they reached the end of the road, a True God suddenly shouted,</p>

  <p>"Oh no! We are out of luck. This time, a group of Time Ghosts are blocking the way. I'm afraid we'll be in trouble."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head and saw a group of blue humanoid creatures flying back and forth at the open intersection in front of them, blocking their way.</p>
