<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had not been present in the Mighty Sword Hall during the argument between Yasamine and Flamine.</p>

  <p>It thus puzzled him to see Yasamin's hostile attitude towards Flamine. He assumed they must have some longstanding grudge against each other.</p>

  <p>As for the tickets to the Chaotic Source World, Zheng didn't know their value, so he did not see it as a big deal when Flamine offered to give him many tickets. He was more curious as to why Yasamin and Flamine were fighting over him. He wondered what that was all about.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked Dorothy, hoping to make sense of everything.</p>

  <p>She smiled at him playfully. "She wants you to be her son-in-law!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked incredulously. His jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>He had only met Flamine one time. It had been a memorable encounter, and she had been very friendly towards him, but to marry her daughter? What the hell was this?</p>

  <p>"Are you tempted?" Dorothy teased. She could see his reaction and deliberately sought to provoke him further.</p>

  <p>Zheng could see what Dorothy was doing, so he modulated his response. He put on a helpless smile and said, "I don't know Feng Ge all that well, and we don't really have anything to do with each other. If Lady Flamine said that, perhaps she was just joking."</p>

  <p>Was he serious? Did he really believe Flamine was just kidding around?</p>

  <p>Dorothy stared at Zheng, her eyes wide with disbelief.</p>

  <p>She was very young and naturally shy, so although she wanted to press him, she decided to stop asking further questions. She was worried that others would think she was jealous.</p>

  <p>After they left the Mighty Sword Hall, Athemar took out a massive sword, motioning for everyone to come closer. They all stepped on the sword and it lifted them into the air. They flew quickly away from Vastness Mountain, eager to be done with the whole ordeal.</p>

  <p>Back in the Mighty Sword Hall, Gethin walked to the golden throne and sat back down.</p>

  <p>Natasha clapped her hands. Green light curtains covered the entire hall.</p>

  <p>Gethin's gentle manner had changed completely. His sharp eyes became ferocious, like those of a furious beast.</p>

  <p>"How many words did you get from him?" he roared.</p>

  <p>Natasha and the two leaders of the intelligence agency looked tense. Their efforts with Zheng had been cut short by the arrival of representatives from Origin Mountain and Oneness Mountain, which was a great shame. It explained why Gethin was so angry.</p>

  <p>"About a hundred words— " Natasha began.</p>

  <p>She was cut short by an energy that lashed out at her with a sharp, cracking sound.</p>

  <p>She let out a croak of pain.</p>

  <p>An invisible hand reached out and grabbed Natasha by the throat, strangling her. She was dragged before Gethin, who watched coldly as she choked.</p>

  <p>She wheezed and struggled unsuccessfully to free herself.</p>

  <p>"After all our efforts, the best you could do was a hundred words? Today I almost couldn't find a way out!" Gethin spat out angrily.</p>

  <p>"Please stop, Emperor Gethin!"</p>

  <p>"Emperor Gethin, what happened was not Lady Natasha's fault!" the two leaders of the intelligence agency spoke up and pleaded with Gethin to be reasonable.</p>

  <p>Gethin threw Natasha to the ground, and she landed with a thud, clutching at her aching throat.</p>

  <p>Gethin's eyes still burned with rage. "The worst part is, we openly asked Zheng about the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. No doubt he will report this to Athemar!"</p>

  <p>"So what? No one in Vastness Mountain harmed Zheng or did anything wrong. They can't accuse us of anything. What can they do to us?" Natasha said, slowly sitting up on the ground. She shot a look of grievance at Gethin.</p>

  <p>Gethin glowered back at her. "You underestimate them. They will suspect us and eventually put together the pieces and figure out what we are doing."</p>

  <p>"Emperor Gethin, you are worrying too much. Given the current situation of the Oneness Sky Palace, it doesn't matter if they notice something. In two to three years, we can finally rest easy. We have strong allies on our side!" said one of the leaders of the intelligence agency.</p>

  <p>Gethin shook his head and exhaled deeply. The fierce light in his eyes grew intense as he said, "I certainly hope so!"</p>

  <p>As they flew, perched on Athemar's huge sword, Zheng told the others what had happened to him on Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The faces of Athemar and Goran darkened.</p>

  <p>"They clearly place a great significance on the Truth Enlightenment, which is strange," said Master Hai.</p>

  <p>"After Zheng deciphers the complete Truth Enlightenment, it will be circulated throughout the entire Oneness Sky Palace sooner or later. Why are they in such a hurry? Do they worry that we won't give it to the Vastness Mountain?" Goran mused.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was strange too," Zheng admitted.</p>

  <p>It was impossible that the people of Vastness Mountain had asked about the Truth Enlightenment without any deeper motive. There was clearly more at stake, something that they just couldn't see yet.</p>

  <p>"Unless... maybe they can't wait," Athemar said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Why not? The Vastness Mountain has existed for a long time. They're not moving away, are they?" Winchell asked.</p>

  <p>As soon as he spoke, the expressions of the others changed.</p>

  <p>Yasamin's eyes narrowed, and she snorted. Coldly she said, "It seems that they have decided to walk on a different path!"</p>

  <p>She and the others realized that Vastness Mountain must be planning to break away eventually from the Oneness Sky Palace. Why would they be so eager to get the Truth Enlightenment ahead of the others, unless they were going to leave the Oneness Sky Palace before the Truth Enlightenment was disseminated to everyone?</p>

  <p>Of course, this was all speculation. They had no evidence except Zheng's experience to support their assumption. But at least for now, they had a theory that explained the mysterious actions of the people of Vastness Mountain, and they would act accordingly.</p>

  <p>"I will report this to Eastern Emperor Taiyi," Master Hai said.</p>

  <p>Athemar touched the huge sword and it sped up. They accelerated until they were flying at a blurring speed, and soon they arrived at Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>As soon as they landed, Zheng started to leave, but Yasamin held out a hand to stop him. She told him that she meant it about preparing the soul crystal for him, and that he needed to get ready to go to the Other Shore to receive it.</p>

  <p>Yasamin was the second most important figure in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>To refuse her would be an act of utmost disrespect. So Zheng nodded obediently.</p>

  <p>At any rate, if the Chaotic Source World was really going to open, then Zheng definitely had no intention of missing this opportunity.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Sky Horizon Province, the Black Ship quietly sailed across the sky.</p>

  <p>Shera sat on one side of the ship, her slender legs dangling in the air.</p>

  <p>A gentle rolling mountain came into view. The mountain was dotted with buildings of various shapes and sizes.</p>

  <p>The tallest building was a whopping ten thousand feet high, while the smallest was only as high as a palm. The variation was too great. Obviously the mountain was home to different races of beings.</p>

  <p>Most of the races in the Source World had carved out their own exclusive territory. It was rare to see different races living together on the same land.</p>

  <p>"We've already arrived at Black Mountain Guild..."</p>

  <p>Shera murmured to herself. She put one hand on the rail while she dragged something with the other hand.</p>

  <p>There was a whoosh, and a man was pulled out of the Black Ship. He slammed onto the deck with a muffled thud.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stood up from the deck, his face full of displeasure. "I was cultivating! You interrupted me when you dragged me here."</p>

  <p>Shera was not bothered by his irritation. "There is a more suitable place for you to cultivate," she said, pointing downwards.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked down. There was a strange, eerie aura emanating from the mountain below them. He could sense that this was not a good place.</p>

  <p>"Below us is the Black Mountain Guild, which is comprised of over 800 races. The competition among the people of that sect is very fierce. It's almost impossible for someone to succeed without a backer. You must be constantly on your guard, even among people of your own race. Not every human can be trusted," Shera said in a clinical, analytic tone, as she gazed down at the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Backer?" The Evil God looked disdainful. "I don't need anyone to back me up. I'm my own backer!"</p>

  <p>By now, Shera was used to the arrogant manner of the Evil God. This man's talent had surprised her again and again. Still, he had just reached the Other Shore Realm, so she thought his arrogance in this instance was unfounded and a bit annoying.</p>

  <p>She curled her lips at him. "Fine. You may go down there now."</p>

  <p>A bang sounded.</p>

  <p>The Evil God suddenly fell, as though a heavy and irresistible weight had been strapped to his body. He dropped from the sky like a stone.</p>
