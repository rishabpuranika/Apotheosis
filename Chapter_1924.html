  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a newly conferred Holy Being, Holy Jay was considered a maverick in the divine land.</p>

  <p>As a Holy Being in the divine land, he still showed some level of prejudice against the secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>A vast majority of martial artists did not bother much about the living beings in their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>This was because the meaning of the existence of the countless beings in an inner world was merely to keep the inner world running smoothly, and make the life vitality to flow even more widely in the cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>Some True Gods would rely on the Faith Energy from their followers within their inner worlds. Others did not require the Faith Energy, especially those who had already reached the Holy Realm. They wouldn't care whether people believed in them or not. Nor would they voluntarily announce their existence to the people within their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>There were too many secondary creatures to bother about.</p>

  <p>Every universe had countless great worlds, and every great world had countless creatures.</p>

  <p>In addition, the inner world of a True God was quite extensive.</p>

  <p>The divine land was so big, that there were all sorts of true spirits and creatures. Apart from them, there were also numerous mountains and the four great divine trees.</p>

  <p>The numbers of secondary creatures inside the bodies of martial artists were countless.</p>

  <p>These lives were inconsequential, especially to martial artists who were True Gods. The existences of these lives were meaningless to them.</p>

  <p>Who would care when the weeds in a forest grew or died?</p>

  <p>But among these 'weeds', there would occasionally be someone that would shine with an extraordinary brilliance. And they would be given ample attention by the martial artists. As for the other weeds, they were still just weeds…</p>

  <p>The existence of the divine land was permanent and stable. It was precisely because of this that the deities within it were tainted with divinity and lost their humanity.</p>

  <p>"That's true," said Holy Jay with a faint smile. "I have definitely forgotten how to revere the living beings, but you have forgotten how to revere me as well."</p>

  <p>For all said and done, he was still a Holy Being with a high status. Even a True God was not allowed to speak to him in such a manner. Although he did not mind Tianming's attitude, he did not appreciate the fact that Tianming had crossed the line.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, 'To be in the king's company is tantamount to living with a tiger.' Even a mortal king could decide the fate of his subjects.</p>

  <p>The status of a Holy Being was comparatively higher. What he could rule over was a part of the divine land!</p>

  <p>If the people of the divine land were to find out that a secondary creature at the Spirit Supreme Realm taught a Holy Being a lesson like that, they would be completely appalled.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming's expression remained unchanged as he said, "There is no need for me to revere you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Holy Jay lost his temper and glared fiercely at Tianming. The intensity of his gaze suddenly made Tianming difficult to breathe. In truth, if he removed the protection shield over Tianming, in a split second he would be reduced to ashes in the preternatural flames.</p>

  <p>"Because I am a daredevil, and will anyways die sooner or later. If a person knows of their end, and still remains obsequious, timid and hesitant, then they are really cowards," Tianming said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Well said," Holy Jay said admiring at his courage.</p>

  <p>"So then what do you plan to do?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay smiled. "Follow me..."</p>

  <p>Soon, Holy Jay brought Tianming at the entrance of the cave.</p>

  <p>It was next to impossible to change the decision of a Holy Being. If a word from an emperor weighed nine tripods, then a word from a Holy Being weighed nine worlds!</p>

  <p>But Tianming had changed some of the stubborn thoughts of Holy Jay through his words. While at the same time, he had also changed the fate of some people.</p>

  <p>Chapman and the others were waiting at the entrance of the cave. The Eye of Void had consumed much of Kaydan's life vitality. At this moment, Kaydan planned to use this secret technique again. He was so close to the door and he wouldn't give up so easily.</p>

  <p>At this moment…</p>

  <p>They saw two people walk out of the cave surrounded by preternatural flames.</p>

  <p>Since the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was built, Holy Jay had never shown his presence to his people. There was no starry sky in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and it was actually an extremely large cave. The entire place was narrower than the universe, because of which the inhabitants of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land seemed to be lacking in imagination. In their history and legends, there were no stories about gods.</p>

  <p>Even so, when Chapman and the others noticed Holy Jay, they instinctively felt a sense of reverence.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What happened to you? What's there?"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu asked curiously. The entrance of the cave was clearly empty, but the warriors from the Collapsing Mountain race, the Skyland race and the Harmony race were all staring in a daze, obviously sensing something different.</p>

  <p>However, just as she spoke up, a thought flashed through Holy Jay's mind.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu, Kennan, and all the martial artists present from the divine land, as well as all the martial artists from universes, had all fallen into a state of confinement. They were trapped in darkness, unable to see, hear, touch or sense the passage of time. The only thing they could do was look into their own inner worlds.</p>

  <p>Certain situations were sensitive, and Holy Jay didn't want others to know that he had an active connection with Luo Zheng. Although this could easily be figured if one used their brain, he didn't want these divine land warriors spread the news in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Kaydan, Chapman and Tilton stepped forward with a look of reverence on their faces.</p>

  <p>They could not understand why they felt that they were in the presence of a venerated person. But it was their instincts that drove them to do so.</p>

  <p>Their instincts even told them that they should kneel down before this person and surrender their body and heart.</p>

  <p>The three of them felt awed about such instinctive reaction, but Kaydan tried his best to suppress this strange feeling as he asked, "You are…"</p>

  <p>"I am the holder of this cave," Holy Jay replied casually.</p>

  <p>The expressions on the faces of all the elders from the three great races changed drastically. They were in a turmoil of mixed emotions.</p>

  <p>Chapman and Kaydan also understood about their instinctive reaction upon seeing this person.</p>

  <p>This person was the builder of this world, the creator of their lives, and also the father of all beings!</p>

  <p>The living beings of this world were not much interested in other Holy Beings, but for the creator of this world, they would absolutely submit to him. Everything in this world was bestowed by this person, from life to cultivation, from knowledge to rules.</p>

  <p>The six great races got to know from the divine land warriors about the existence of such a Holy Being in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but it was not until today that they finally got to see him.</p>

  <p>After they were all appalled for a moment, they began to feel incomparably excited!</p>

  <p>"You, you really are our creator!" Kaydan was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay slightly nodded.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, my lord!" Kaydan couldn't help but bow down.</p>

  <p>At the same time, all the people from the three great races knelt down.</p>

  <p>This kind of instinctive piety came straight from their hearts and instincts.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay casually waved his hand and an invisible force exerted on each person's knees. The strength was so precise that everyone appeared to be lifted off the ground at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" Holy Jay said calmly. "I know that you have tried many times to find a way to cross the heavens. I want to tell you that there is no such way in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, so you cannot leave the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. If you still dare to do so, you can imagine the consequences!"</p>

  <p>Even if Holy Jay had not taken the initiative to speak about this, Kaydan and the others would have definitely raised this question. Now that Holy Jay had cleared this point, the faces of Kaydan and the rest froze in anticipation.</p>

  <p>They had already collected this information from the martial artists of other races and divine land. Hence it was no longer a secret. But they still didn't give up and followed the last glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>But if they were to hear it from the mouth of their master, it would be equivalent to sentencing them to death.</p>

  <p>Their pursuit in life was meaningless.</p>

  <p>Forcefully leaving the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land would mean that they would turn into life vitality and disappear. It was because they were secondary creatures and the fate that awaited them was cruelly simple.</p>

  <p>"Is there no other way?" Kaydan asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay patted Tianming's shoulder and said, "You should thank this young man for persuading me. Therefore, I will give you all a chance to comprehend the Godly Way."</p>

  <p>Until now, everyone had fallen into despair. After all, Holy Jay had personally confirmed that there was no way from them to leave the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that what Holy Jay said next would pull them out from the abyss of despair into the heaven of hope!</p>

  <p>All the aboriginals looked at Tianming gratefully. Tianming seemed to have become a savior in their eyes. They could form no words to express their gratitude.</p>
