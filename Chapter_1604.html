  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman in red frowned slightly and said, "It might be a coincidence?"</p>

  <p>She and Ning Yudie had ascended at the same time. The two of them had become quite sympathetic to each other, especially since she had discovered that Ning Yudie was actually looking for her own husband. She had also advised Ning Yudie to give up as there had seemed to be no hope of ever finding her husband.</p>

  <p>Now that she suddenly heard Yudie's answer, how could she possibly believe it?</p>

  <p>The universe was so vast, there could be many warriors with the same surname and name. The name Luo Luo Zheng was not an uncommon name.</p>

  <p>However, what she didn't know was that Ning Yudie had already successfully confirmed Luo Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie stared at the warrior with them and said, "The story 'Killing the Snake Spirit' is a story that has spread throughout our Central Region. It relates how a man met a snake spirit at a thorny mountain and fell in love with her. However, the snake spirit could not get rid of her brutish nature and killed a lot of people. At last, the poor man had to kill the snake spirit... The story should originally have been like this, right?"</p>

  <p>"Right!" The warrior suddenly nodded his head and looked into Yudie's eyes. He believed her words.</p>

  <p>The story had been told by Luo Luo Zheng through his Roaring Token. It had spread widely and was exactly the same as the story which the woman in front of him had just summarized.</p>

  <p>This story had been told three or four years ago in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, this woman had just ascended, but she already knew this story.</p>

  <p>At the very least, it showed that she and Luo Luo Zheng came from the same Lower World.</p>

  <p>She probably...</p>

  <p>Actually, Ning Yudie hadn't wanted to prove anything to them.</p>

  <p>She was already deeply satisfied in knowing that her husband was still alive, where he was and that he was doing well.</p>

  <p>'He is still as surprising as always!' Ning Yudie thought as she looked up at the pyramid where countless names were floating, occasionally changing places as the warriors fought and won, or lost battles.</p>

  <p>As for the warrior, when he heard these words, his heart began to burn with unbridled passion.</p>

  <p>This warrior had not ascended. He didn't have any greatly significant background in the Pure Jade Sacred Place. In order to earn even basic rewards, he had been assigned to supply the Illusion Space with life vitality.</p>

  <p>If what the woman in front of him had said was a lie, it wouldn't be a big deal. However, it seemed like there was a 50 % chance that her story was true. If it was true, then if he could somehow help the woman? For a grassroots warrior like him, this might be a once in a lifetime opportunity!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was unaware of what the warrior in front of her was thinking, and she thought for a moment, then asked, "But why did Luo Luo Zheng use the Roaring Token to tell stories in the universe?"</p>

  <p>"He did it for a mysterious girl," the warrior laughed. Everyone in the universe had been able to hear the conversation between Luo Luo Zheng and the mysterious girl, so this warrior was no exception.</p>

  <p>"A mysterious girl?" Ning Yudie frowned slightly and one eyebrow arched slightly, as if it was a conditioned reflex.</p>

  <p>The warrior noticed Yudie's expression and shrugged. "I don't know who that mysterious girl was, or what kind of background she had. The entire universe still doesn't know her identity, but she agreed to help Luo Luo Zheng locate his sister. To meet the terms of their agreement, he had to tell stories to her." Almost everyone in the universe knew about this strange arrangement between Luo Luo Zheng and the mysterious girl.</p>

  <p>"His younger sister, Yan?" Ning Yudie asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Right!" The warrior's eyes suddenly brightened, and he became even more certain about Yudie's identity, as he agreed, "Her name is Yan!"</p>

  <p>"So he hasn't found her..." Ning Yudie murmured as she lowered her head, and then her eyes turned once more on the pyramid.</p>

  <p>She suddenly became interested in the pyramid at the top of the Illusion Space, and she examined the names from the top to where Luo Zheng's name floated.</p>

  <p>These names were all potential competition for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>While they were still observing the order of names, a wave of sighs resounded from the far side of the hall.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's ranking has increased by two again!"</p>

  <p>With a smile on her face, Ning Yudie continued sweeping her gaze, allowing her eyes to drift below Luo Zheng's name, and not long after, she saw another familiar name.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>One hundred sixty-fourth!</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie saw this name, she was utterly stunned yet again.</p>

  <p>She had accumulated such a strong power?</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie knew that Xi Youqin's Purple Power Body was very special, back in the Central Region, Xi Youqin's cultivation had only been at the Internal Elixir Realm. Furthermore, if she didn't rely on her own bloodline, her strength would disintegrate into a complete mess!</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Mu Ning had gone to the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>It had only been a few years.</p>

  <p>How did she already enter the Soul Sea Realm? Furthermore, how did she come to possess such a strong power? A tremendous power almost the same as Luo Zheng's?</p>

  <p>How was this possible?!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie found it hard to accept this result.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, in the end, there were always warriors of advanced talent, and they could often achieve success in cultivation much more easily.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was a warrior with good talent, but when compared to the talents of the Soul Sea Realm in the Upper World, the gap became very obvious.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning was different from any other warriors.</p>

  <p>Her first rank Purple Power Body was something special, and was considered the highest existence within the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Coupled with the great effort that Elder Apeiron from the Apeiron Tower had put in to nurture her, her cultivation and strength naturally advanced at a divine speed. With her first rank Purple Power Body's ability, she could cultivate many methods which were difficult for others to cultivate in their lives. But for Mu Ning, the cultivation was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>Looking at Xi Youqin's ranking, Ning Yudie felt depressed. She couldn't help but let out a woeful sigh. "How could this be true?"</p>

  <p>After obtaining the reward for traversing the third Hall of Causality, Luo Zheng's ranking once again rose, but only by two ranks.</p>

  <p>The reward of the third Hall of Causality was only three million Illusion Points and everyone had received that too. For Luo Luo Zheng, the reward for the third Hall of Causality was much less than the reward of the second, but if he regarded Lone's Illusion Points as a part of the reward, then he had received a substantial amount of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>After the group left the third Hall of Causality, the hooks laced with the heavens' rule in everyone's hands slowly began to disappear.</p>

  <p>It looked like the long hooks were not allowed to leave the Hall of Causality. Otherwise, the rules of the heavens contained within the long hooks would offer an unfair advantage to everyone here.</p>

  <p>Sad at having to relinquish the fabulous weapons, they continued to climb the stairs.</p>

  <p>At this moment, they were standing on the upper section of this grand mountain. From this flight of stairs, they were able to enjoy the magnificent vistas around the mountain.</p>

  <p>Although the Hall of Causality had been constructed by the heavens, everything was lifelike. Perhaps these grand sights weren't illusions, but were completely real? For the heavens, this wasn't a difficult feat to accomplish.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was leading the way, while Janet, Jeffrey, and Hailey followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>After having passed through the third Hall of Causality, they would now face the fourth hall, the penultimate Hall of Causality!</p>

  <p>The first time Janet had faced the challenge of the Hall of Causality, she had failed in the fourth hall.</p>

  <p>It could even be said that 99% of the warriors, who had attempted the trial, had been eliminated at the penultimate Hall of Causality. It was simply too difficult to pass and changed with each attempt. Hence, no one knew what they would encounter in the fourth Hall of Causality this time?</p>

  <p>A short while later, everyone was standing on the landing before the fourth Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The fourth Hall of Causality was completely red. Flames could be seen writhing in it. Even standing at the entrance to the hall, one could feel the intense heat radiating from it.</p>

  <p>"So hot! It's so scorching!" Coleman called out in a strangely panicked voice.</p>

  <p>"The reward of the fourth Hall of Causality is generous, but the difficulty cannot be underestimated. Everyone, you have to be on your guard and show great caution!" Janet warned them.</p>

  <p>"Regardless of the difficulty, we cannot give up now," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's ranking rose rapidly, he bravely entered the Hall of Causality in the lead, without any hesitation. Janet, Jeffrey, and the others sized him up before following closely behind.</p>

  <p>The floor of this Hall of Causality was covered in cracks. These cracks were only as wide as a finger, but within these cracks, red hot magma was flowing. The cracks resembled the veins of a human being, but the human blood had been replaced with the magma.</p>

  <p>Walking gingerly over the floor, they felt like they were being roasted by the magma underneath their feet.</p>

  <p>Although Janet, Hailey, and the others would not be injured by the magma, they still couldn't bear the heat. One by one, they unleashed their protective life vitality to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng naturally didn't need such protection, for ordinary flames wouldn't be able to harm him at all.</p>

  <p>As they ventured deeper and deeper, the scenery of the Hall of Causality kept changing, as if they had entered a gigantic volcanic cave. The walls around them had been replaced with jagged, and irregular rocks.</p>

  <p>Through the haze caused by the intense heat, they suddenly saw a lake of magma ahead of them.</p>

  <p>Everyone stopped in their tracks as they looked at the apparently calm magma lake. The occasional bubble softly popped on the glowing surface, and a cautious look appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>At the edge of this magma lake, there stood a Lava Giant as big as a mountain, entirely made of lava. Its enormous body slowly rotated within the magma. The behemoth looked down on Luo Luo Zheng and the others with an intense and dangerous intent.</p>
