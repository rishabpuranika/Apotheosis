  <p>Hearing the referee announced the next match, Tracy flashed a smile.</p>

  <p>Standing on the battle ring, she looked at Luo Luo Zheng with her pretty eyes and said in a happy tone, "After I've waited for so long, the moment finally came! Luo Luo Zheng, I can't say that this is your lucky day. I suppose you cannot run away anymore!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at Tracy with a slight smile and said indifferently, "To be honest, unlike you, I'm not looking forward to this fight at all."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Tracy, pouting her lips.</p>

  <p>"Because I don't know what I'll do if I win," Luo Luo Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>Tracy had challenged Luo Luo Zheng and said the losing party would be punished at the discretion of the winning party.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you can beat me?" Tracy asked boldly, raising her fine eyebrows gently.</p>

  <p>"I guess so," Luo Luo Zheng said lightly and nodded rather positively.</p>

  <p>"All right. I just planned to give you a little punishment, but now I have changed my mind. Once I defeat you, you'll be my horse and I will ride you whenever I want. You bend your knees and arms like a real live horse!" she said without the slightest intention of joking.</p>

  <p>After that, Tracy raised her slender fingers to her head and took two Emei pricks from her hair.</p>

  <p>The two one-foot-long Emei pricks were her hair ornaments when not used as weapons.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's a risky gamble and the stake is just too high! How could she ask Luo Luo Zheng to be her horse?" one disciple complained.</p>

  <p>"She is really going too far. If Luo Luo Zheng loses to her, he has to listen to her every order!" another disciple added with full of concern for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But since every disciple had seen what Tracy had done to Bass, no one dared to provoke her. Nobody would know what would happen when they irritated the little demon. She would completely disregard the rules of the competition and just punished everyone to her liking.</p>

  <p>"I agree, but only if you can really beat me!" Luo Luo Zheng replied shortly.</p>

  <p>"Very well! It seems that you still look down on me," Tracy said, slightly pouting her lips. "Then you are bound to regret!"</p>

  <p>She exercised her skills and turned the two Emei pricks in her hand into two blue-grey sharp shadows rushing towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In her previous matches, Tracy had already shown her remarkable speed.</p>

  <p>Many disciples of the Cloud Sect were astonished about it and regarded it as total perfection.</p>

  <p>Just as the two sharp shadows were about to pierce through Luo Zheng's body, he easily avoided them by a gentle movement of his feet.</p>

  <p>Tracy surely went all out in this match.</p>

  <p>Patrick once commented that if Tracy's talent ranked the second place among the disciples in Cloud Sect, then he thought no one would dare to rank the first place.</p>

  <p>Although Tracy's talent was second to none, unfortunately, she did not like to practice persistently. She would practice her skills for a few days and then do stuff that was just a waste of her talent for the other days.</p>

  <p>Despite having less time to practice, she still had amazing strength and power.</p>

  <p>"Feather Pricks!" Tracy shouted as she exercised her special skill.</p>

  <p>With her own special skills, Tracy created several ghost shadows.</p>

  <p>Once the speed of anything, whether it was human or other objects, reached ultra-high, the ghost shadows would occur.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could also produce his own ghost shadows.</p>

  <p>But Tracy's ghost shadows were particularly special because they were not just shadows, but the replica of Tracy with the same strength.</p>

  <p>"Well!" Luo Luo Zheng said lightly as his eyes slightly narrowed. Sooner, dozens of ghost shadows surrounded Luo Luo Zheng. Each of them replicated Tracy's movements and each was holding an Emei prick as they fired sharp blue-grey shadow attacks toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tracy's approach was somewhat like Johanson's, except that Johanson's shadows could only hide his real body, while Tracy's could launch an attack.</p>

  <p>But Tracy didn't have Johanson's brilliant hiding skills, and with Luo Zheng's magnificent spirit-sensing power, he could tell Tracy's location in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Although Tracy's dozens of ghost shadows were launching more than one hundred sharp blue-grey shadow attacks against Luo Luo Zheng, he just ignored most of the attacks, kept holding his broken flying knife and constantly waved on his side to block the flank attacks.</p>

  <p>"Ding, ding, ding..." came the sound of the collision.</p>

  <p>With the broken flying knife in his hand, he blocked hundreds of blue-grey shadow attacks in a short time. The attacks launched by the ghost shadows were just phantoms that didn't do any harm to Luo Luo Zheng even though they pierced through his body.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng was able to dodge her attacks with his tiny flying knife, Tracy suddenly changed her fighting strategy. Now instead of surrounding Luo Luo Zheng, she chose close combat.</p>

  <p>The two disciples used short weapons.</p>

  <p>Tracy's Emei pricks were sharp, but Luo Zheng's reaction was quick. They had launched millions of attacks against each other instantly.</p>

  <p>They were moving too fast that the audience could only see their shadows and hear their weapons colliding.</p>

  <p>"Your attack is really not effective to me. And with that level, I can defeat you in an instant," said Luo Luo Zheng confidently. His defense was effective considering that he was only using his broken flying knife. His strength was also considerably greater compared to his opponent.</p>

  <p>Tracy knew that he was right. She could feel that Luo Zheng's power was beyond hers. Luo Luo Zheng could block her attacks by gently moving from side to side, while her body was starting to numb. Starting to slow down her attacks, she stared at Luo Luo Zheng with her pouted lips and said, "I guess you're right. Maybe it's time to use my trump card."</p>

  <p>Patrick, who was sitting with the audience, suddenly stood up when he heard what Tracy said. No matter how stable and calm his character was, he could no longer remain cool. He persuaded earnestly, "Tracy, it's just a fight. There's no need to use that!"</p>

  <p>Patrick knew that if Tracy was forced to use that move, even he could not defeat her! But once that move was activated, it would have a great impact on Tracy's physical condition.</p>

  <p>"But he left me no choice! If I don't use that move, I'm going to lose to him!" Tracy said, with a trace of grievance on her face. Apparently, she was extremely unwilling to lose.</p>

  <p>"You know that you're not as powerful as him, so you will lose one way or the other. It's just one match! Losing this one will not affect any of your standings! Tracy, if you feel you can't win, just admit defeat now!</p>

  <p>I'm sure Luo Luo Zheng won't mind. Luo Luo Zheng, do you agree with me?" said Patrick seriously.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said, "Absolutely! I won't punish Tracy or do anything embarrassing to her."</p>

  <p>Tracy shut her lips tight and was still a little reluctant to give up. Just as Luo Luo Zheng and Patrick thought that Tracy was ready to admit defeat, she suddenly said, "No! I won't return the same favor if I defeat you!"</p>

  <p>After that, the two Emei pricks in Tracy's hand twirled lightly and rushed towards her temples.</p>

  <p>The Emie pricks pricked the acupuncture point in her temples, then another 16 acupuncture points in her arms, calf, and neck, leaving red dots all over her body.</p>

  <p>This process happened so fast that Patrick hardly had any time to stop her. He had no way but to heave a deep sigh. As he had expected, it would never be that easy to dissuade the unruly Tracy. Now, Luo Luo Zheng would meet a horrible opponent.</p>

  <p>After the sixteen acupoints were punctured, Tracy's momentum changed rapidly.</p>

  <p>The audience could clearly see the life vitality mingled with blood emitting from the 16 acupoints and continuously condensed behind Tracy.</p>

  <p>"The body of Blue Phoenix activated!" Tracy said. Tracy's voice was changed from her original naughty and lovely tone to current supremely majestic tone.</p>

  <p>"Blue Phoenix? Is this what I think it is? The legendary beast Blue Phoenix? Why does Tracy have the body of Blue Phoenix? Is she actually a legendary beast?" one disciple exclaimed doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Blue Phoenix is such a noble legendary beast. How did it become a disciple of Cloud Sect? I guess she was born with Blue Phoenix blood in her body!" another disciple analyzed carefully.</p>

  <p>"I used to think that Tracy's strength is not very strong, probably only a little stronger than Jill and weaker than Wing, Sheeny and other similarly powerful disciples. But I did not expect that she was born with the blood of the legendary beast. With that blood running through her veins, I don't think any disciple could compare to her!" another disciple commented excitedly.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect disciples had all heard about all sorts of legends about the legendary beasts but none of them had seen any of them.</p>

  <p>And now that the personal disciple Tracy had the blood of the legendary beast Blue Phoenix, it was a mind-blowing revelation for everyone.</p>

  <p>According to the legends, the strongest super legendary beasts belonged to the four major races: Cyan Dragon, Crimson Rosefinch, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise. The other less powerful super legendary beasts were the Roc, Blue Phoenix, the Nine-Colored Deer, and so on.</p>

  <p>As the blood boiled inside Tracy, she was gradually emitting more life vitality that slowly condensed and transformed into a faint shadow of Blue Phoenix.</p>

  <p>The Blue Phoenix shadow was faint, but it exuded a strong sense of power.</p>

  <p>Even the Elders who were maintaining the order of the competition showed caution on their faces. Although they could sense no threats with Tracy's current strength, the sight of the legendary beast impressed them.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why, but I hate you. I hate your look and your behaviors, so I must teach you a good lesson!" said Tracy arrogantly. At the moment, her momentum had completely changed. From her evil and righteous character, she turned into a noble and superior goddess!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a little speechless at the sight of the changed Tracy. Judging from Patrick's tone, it seemed that Tracy couldn't activate the body of Blue Phoenix at will. He also had no clue as to when and where he had irritated the little girl that resulted to this.</p>

  <p>Originally, he thought it would be easy to win this match, but he absolutely did not expect the Tracy had a hidden trump card.</p>

  <p>After her transformation, her presence was dominating that it almost suffocated Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'It looks like it's time to take things seriously, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself as he took his Streamer Sword out of his Space Ring.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had planned to use the sword only when fighting with Tianming or Patrick. Yet, in the face of the transformed Tracy, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to use it because he knew that if he continued to hide strength, he was most likely to be defeated by Tracy!</p>
