<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4297 Infinite Treatment </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nobody dared to look down upon the downgrader. If he was able to downgrade the worlds, then that meant he was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Surely though, there was a limit to his strength.</p>

  <p>The power he just exhibited exceeded everyone's expectations and filled their bodies with despair. How could he be so powerful?</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a lie. He truly has real, infinite energy," Zheng's avatar muttered, trying his best to remain calm.</p>

  <p>"The real infinity..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess smiled in self-mockery. "If that is the case then resistance is futile."</p>

  <p>All numbers meant nothing with regards to the real definition of infinity.</p>

  <p>"It was once said that the truth was controlled by us six Chaos Ancient Gods; however, the infinite energy displayed by the downgrader is the absolute truth. This is power with no restrictions." Gerald could only sigh.</p>

  <p>All hope that remained in their hearts had been quashed by this revelation.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just them. Even the energy souls that floated around the Civilization Artifact also felt dejected. They had sacrificed themselves yet in the end, it was all for naught.</p>

  <p>"But... Don't you still want to give it a try?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>His voice had been loud and everyone on the jadeite platform heard him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's words triggered something in them. Kincaid, who had previously also lost hope, raised his head. "You're right! Despair is meaningless! Since we cannot escape death, then we must at least face it head-on in battle!"</p>

  <p>"My dream has been completed. Even if I die, I will have no regrets," Itzel seconded.</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>With just a few hopeful words, the morale on the jadeite platform rose exponentially.</p>

  <p>A blue ring of light appeared in the hand of Zheng's avatar, which contained the energy of the Hyperspace Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>"Zheng? Why?" Tianming asked, having felt the mysterious power of space.</p>

  <p>"You may be stronger than the Troubled Creatures but the fact remains that they have the Hyperspace Extreme Form. Other than Geoffrey, nobody else would be able to touch them. Allow me to help you offset their advantage," Zheng's avatar replied.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng's avatars were stronger than everyone present on the platform, the Troubled Creatures had no problem slaying every single one. This was because the Troubled Creatures were endowed with the Hyperspace Extreme Form, which rendered them uncatchable.</p>

  <p>The only way to resist was to reduce this advantage. Zheng's avatars could create a large area wherein everyone could muster the strength to fight back.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart, however, was clear.</p>

  <p>He knew that resistance was futile as they were faced against about seventy billion Troubled Creatures with the Hyperspace and Destruction Extreme Forms. There was no winning this fight.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>One of his avatars suddenly appeared in a hall on top of Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Yan sat in the pavilion on the left side of the hall. Geoffrey's voice buzzed in her ears and she had half a mind to go and join everyone on the jadeite platform even if the Snake Goddess had yet to summon her.</p>

  <p>"Brother?" Yan called out when she saw Zheng's avatar.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to join us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Of course!" she replied with no hesitation.</p>

  <p>In the fairy palace, another one of Zheng's avatars appeared in Yudie's room.</p>

  <p>His sudden appearance surprised her but she remained calm.</p>

  <p>With her cultivation base, it was hard for her to tell whether it was truly Zheng or just his avatar.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Yudie gave him a gentle smile. "It seems that time is running out, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he nodded. "I'm..."</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to apologize, Yudie held a finger to his lips and shushed him. "You didn't do anything wrong."</p>

  <p>And with that, Zheng simply pulled her close and held her in his arms.</p>

  <p>In a courtyard of the fairy palace, Margaret was currently placing some books in front of Salome. The young girl was extremely intelligent and could already read, so Margaret thought it best to borrow some books from the library for her.</p>

  <p>In the midst of their study session, Zheng's avatar quietly condensed and stared at her and Salome.</p>

  <p>His appearance went unnoticed as Margaret was too busy sorting the books out.</p>

  <p>Salome, however, noticed him and called out to her father. Margaret stiffened and when she turned around, her eyes were already red with tears.</p>

  <p>She had heard Zheng's announcement. She was no fool. She completely understood the current situation they were all in.</p>

  <p>Unlike Yudie, however, Margaret was afraid of death and couldn't handle this calmly.</p>

  <p>"Waah... Waah..."</p>

  <p>With a loud sob, Margaret ran to Zheng's avatar and collapsed in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Salome hasn't even grown up yet! She's innocent! She hasn't seen much of the world. Can you protect her and let her live on?"</p>

  <p>Her words stabbed a metaphorical blade onto Zheng's heart but he shook his head. "I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"What if you send her to the chaos?" Margaret asked again.</p>

  <p>"Not even the chaos will let her escape this disaster," he told her.</p>

  <p>"What about the Abstruse Energy World? Salome could live there, right?</p>

  <p>Why not send her there?" Margaret insisted, not willing to give up just yet.</p>

  <p>She had heard of that magical world and knew her daughter was talented so maybe she could live there? She had no idea of the situation in the Abstruse Energy World but she didn't care. All she wanted was for her daughter to live on.</p>

  <p>"She won't be able to escape this disaster there either," Zheng said, shaking his head once again.</p>

  <p>Not understanding what was happening, Salome simply looked on at her parents and behaved well.</p>

  <p>She had read many books but her time in this world was too short. Of course, she knew life and death but did not really have a good grasp of what those two concepts truly meant.</p>

  <p>"Why? Why?" Margaret continued to wail.</p>

  <p>Another avatar also appeared in Aura's room.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't the only one to say his final goodbyes to his family.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors did the same thing. Some bade farewell to their loved ones, while others felt the need to inform their inner worlds of their imminent destruction.</p>

  <p>In the cloud of Probability Extreme Form, Zheng had transformed into a thousand avatars that launched more than ten thousand sword strikes towards the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Despite the attacks, the downgrader did not even bother summoning his avatars to dodge.</p>

  <p>More than ten thousand long swords came at him as he floated in the air, all of them transformed from the Destruction Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a flash of violet as the purple sword radiance drew over ten thousand paths in the air in an effort to slash at the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The power Zheng released at that moment should've been enough to tear his enemy to shreds and even disintegrate him.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrader remained completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>In fact, a strong aura of life continued to emanate from his body as he activated the Life Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Of course, that alone was not the reason as to why he was able to withstand Zheng's attack. In truth, an infinite energy of the Life Extreme Form was gathered in his body.</p>

  <p>Any damage dealt to him was repaired at an imperceptible speed. That was why such a miraculous scene was delivered.</p>
