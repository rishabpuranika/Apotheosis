<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Mu Ning found Zheng's response strange and wondered why Luo Zheng looked a little uneasy. She had misunderstood Luo Zheng. It was a mistake on her part to take it for granted that Luo Zheng had thrown himself into Ray's lap.</p>

  <p>"But I heard that you had been placed under house arrest. I came here to free you today!" Luo Zheng finally recovered and declared in a firm tone, with his gaze fixated on Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>He was confused as to why Mu Ning was so cold and unkind to him. But right now, thinking of his purpose for coming here, he decided that he had to make every possible effort to achieve his end. Even though Mu Ning was reluctant, Luo Zheng wasn't going to rashly change his mind. This was just who Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>"Free me from house arrest?" Mu Ning questioned back in a daze. Very soon, she added, "Will you be able to do so?"</p>

  <p>In Aura's opinion, it was improbable that Ray was going to put Luo Zheng in an important position even if Luo Zheng had decided to stand by Ray's side and become his subordinate. After all, too many talented and capable people served Ray, so Luo Zheng was not indispensable for the prince, especially since he was only a nature creature.</p>

  <p>"How would I know if I don't try!" Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's calm and sure reply, Ray chuckled all of a sudden, strolling over to him. He told him, "Luo Zheng, it is not impossible for you to take Mu Ning away!"</p>

  <p>'It is not impossible?' mumbled Mu Ning. She was shocked by the prince's words. She was even doubting her ears right now.</p>

  <p>In political conflicts of a royal family, attention was particularly paid to ruthless attack against opponents. Mu Ning couldn't believe it at all that Ray was going to let go of her so easily.</p>

  <p>So why had he said something like that? How could it have been possible for Luo Zheng to make Ray concede?</p>

  <p>Ray nodded and continued with his gaze fixated on Mu Ning, "But with one condition!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face turned gloomy when he heard the words coming out of Ray's mouth. Without any thought at all, he could easily guess what condition this guy was going to propose.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to figure out the condition, but Mu Ning couldn't, and thus, she asked, "What condition?"</p>

  <p>"My sister, I will allow you to leave the Shine Hall and be free if Luo Zheng agrees to join me!" Ray stated in a simple tone.</p>

  <p>'What?' Mu Ning grumbled. Ray's condition astounded Mu Ning, who mumbled deep in her mind, 'Hasn't Luo Zheng thrown himself into Ray's lap already? Are they play-acting? Why is he saying that he will free me if Luo Zheng joins him?</p>

  <p>What on earth is going on?' Mu Ning was totally confused. She was lost in her complex thoughts and couldn't clear up her mind.</p>

  <p>Of course, Ray turned a blind eye to the fact that Mu Ning was deeply indulging in her own wild thoughts. He had his own viewpoints.</p>

  <p>In fact, Ray believed that Mu Ning was not critical for his cause. Perhaps she had developed some interpersonal relationships with the top seven noble clans, which might be helpful for the crown prince. However, right now, the top seven noble clans had already taken sides. The crown prince was just in name only and like a puppet. Thus, it was completely impossible to reverse the situation.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it wouldn't matter at all even if Ray let Mu Ning out. No problems would be caused further as long as the crown prince was still under his control.</p>

  <p>However, it would be a great deal for Ray if Luo Zheng was willing to join him on the premise that he let go of Mu Ning. Based on Zheng's strengths, Ray would have a greater chance to gain support from Cloud Sect. If that really ended up happening as Ray had planned, it would be beyond doubt that he would win very soon.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning was not satisfied by Ray's condition at all. She stood there in bafflement for quite a long while. As she snapped out of her daze, she suddenly switched her gaze towards Luo Zheng and asked, "Luo Zheng, I still don't know your ranking in this All Peaks Competition. How did you score? How far did you go?"</p>

  <p>The only thing that made sense to Mu Ning was that Ray's condition might be associated with the All Peaks Competition, or else how could it be possible to exchange her freedom for Zheng's loyalty! 'Unless... Luo Zheng has made some amazing achievements in the All Peaks Competition. His achievements were so amazing that Ray feels satisfied with his fighting tactics, ' Mu Ning guessed.</p>

  <p>'But it would mean nothing for Ray at all even Luo Zheng has been ranked among top 100. Did Luo Zheng manage to land in the top 50?' No, wait! That was not enough for Ray to pay so much attention to Luo Zheng. If Luo Zheng had been put in the list of top 20, there was a small likelihood that Ray would speak highly of Zheng's tactics, but it was still impossible for Ray to let Mu Ning go just because of that rank. Did Luo Zheng win one of the top ten places?</p>

  <p>Or top five? Or top three? Aura's guesses kept on inching closer, even though she herself felt that her guesses were rather ridiculous. Since all her guesses were absurd, she had no choice but to ask Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, contrary to all of her expectations, Luo Zheng touched his head and responded gently, "Master Su, I won the first place!"</p>

  <p>"The first place..."</p>

  <p>Aura's voice faltered before she could finish her sentence. Perhaps she was the last one to have come to know about this and also the one that was the most shocked to hear the news.</p>

  <p>After all, she had always been the one to show the greatest concerns for Luo Zheng. In addition, she had been placing the greatest hope on Luo Zheng for getting good results. And even if she hadn't been, she was Zheng's master.</p>
