<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4212 The Might Of The Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The space wall, carefully crafted by the Space Guiding Stone, was so formidable that it was impossible to resist its force.</p>

  <p>That was why even the Great Ape King, Lawler, and Duran were trapped by it.</p>

  <p>However, once Zheng raised his foot and stomped hard on it with his might, it crumbled down as though it were nothing to him. Then, he soared into the sky in a fleeting moment.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess moved her head up as she kept her gaze fixated on Zheng's rising figure and asked, "What do you think Zheng meant when he said Kincaid defeated the Snake Spirit King?"</p>

  <p>"The more important question is, why is Kincaid not here? He's been freed, hasn't he?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven sounded just as puzzled.</p>

  <p>Just as they pondered over to make sense of the situation in their heads, their train of thought was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a Treacherous Being at the square entrance. It was an elderly looking human spirit.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a short gasp as his eyes fell on the elderly figure. Recovering from his state of disbelief, he frantically cupped his hands and bowed respectfully. "Master Kincaid."</p>

  <p>"What? Master Kincaid?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others switched their gazes from the Primeval Lord of Heaven to the elderly figure that stood in the distance.</p>

  <p>Judging from the Primeval Lord of Heaven's gesture, they instinctively concluded that man to be Kincaid.</p>

  <p>However, the old man diffused their suspicions with a slight wave of his hand as he spoke, "No, you've got it wrong. I'm not Master Kincaid."</p>

  <p>"Then, who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm simply Master Kincaid's servant. My name is Corbett," the elderly man answered in a dignified tone.</p>

  <p>In the entire Human Spirit Sect, Corbett was Kincaid's most loyal and sincerest servant. He had been serving him for countless years without faltering.</p>

  <p>Even though he had transformed into a Treacherous Being after he died, he still continued to perform his duties by guarding the altar.</p>

  <p>"Master Corbett, what happened inside the altar? Where is Master Kincaid?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, unable to contain his curiosity any longer.</p>

  <p>"Was the Snake Spirit King really defeated by Master Kincaid?" The Snake Goddess voiced her concerns after him.</p>

  <p>Corbett looked at the Snake Spirit King in the sky. A shadow of sadness hovered over his eyes as his expression turned gloomy. "Yes, the Snake Spirit King had entered the altar before and failed to resolve the trap set up by Master Kincaid, which resulted in his death."</p>

  <p>"So the key to the altar is a trap?" The Snake Goddess's expression switched as she raised her brow.</p>

  <p>"That's right." Corbett nodded to her question and continued, "The Snake Spirit King, as a Treacherous Being, couldn't defeat Master Kincaid, so he wanted to lure someone else to enter the altar."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what happened, the Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven gasped in unison.</p>

  <p>Before they could recover from the shocking news, Fuxi asked a direct question, "Where is Master Kincaid right now? Why isn't he here?"</p>

  <p>The sole reason behind them coming to the altar was to look for the Human Spirit King.</p>

  <p>But Zheng came out alone shrouded in heavy armor and wielding a sword. It didn't make any sense. What was going on?</p>

  <p>"Zheng has placed Master Kincaid in his Sumeru Space. He hasn't awakened yet," Corbett sighed.</p>

  <p>After being exposed to the truth, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess were all rendered speechless as they fell into a crippling depression.</p>

  <p>They had pinned all their hopes on the Human Spirit King and were at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>They each had sacrificed so much to get here, only to find out they were being used as pawns in the carefully crafted scheme of the Snake Spirit King all this while. Naturally, they felt a deep sense of helplessness overcome them as they felt their hearts sink.</p>

  <p>"Let's not drop all our weapons and lay waste to all our efforts. Maybe all of this can be reversed. Maybe, Zheng could win." Gonggong, who had kept silent all this while, suddenly spoke up to lift everyone's spirits. "Don't underestimate him and his talent to turn the tables in his favor. He has inherited the powerful ancestry-level bloodline. Don't be so pessimistic."</p>

  <p>"There are many powerful warriors in our sect, and each of them has inherited the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline, but in the end, they still suffered the same fate and ended up like this," Corbett said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Master Corbett, you misunderstood what I said. Zheng didn't inherit the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline. He has inherited the complete ancestry-level bloodline itself."</p>

  <p>Perhaps Corbett was still in a daze from his recent awakening, which clouded his thoughts. After taking a few seconds to process what he just heard, Corbett blurted out abruptly, "Wait. What? Are you telling me he has inherited the complete ancestry-level bloodline? Are you serious?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, he's telling the truth," the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded along as he responded.</p>

  <p>"Are you absolutely sure about this?" Corbett was still in a state of utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven stepped forward to place his hand on Corbett's shoulder and responded to clear the air, "As Eternal Realm warriors, we know that clearly. There's no doubt about it. Zheng can use the power of the four quadrants at will, which is given by the ancestry-level bloodline."</p>

  <p>Just as those words escaped the mouth of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Corbett's eyes lit up as though they regained their lost vitality.</p>

  <p>"No wonder! No wonder he defeated Master Kincaid. That sword... Yes!</p>

  <p>There's a chance he could win with that sword!" Corbett spoke in a high-pitched voice, unable to hide the excitement sprouting within him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>At this moment, the irregular heavy sword that Zheng wielded began to reflect strong emotions of fury and anger through its demeanor.</p>

  <p>Although it couldn't speak, it was capable of transmitting human emotions. It could feel anger and sadness.</p>

  <p>Face to face with the culprit responsible for the death of the Human Spirit King, the irregular heavy sword was brimming with unparalleled rage.</p>

  <p>"You want to kill him, don't you?" Zheng addressed the irregular heavy sword as he felt its emotions from its behavior.</p>

  <p>Immediately after hearing what Zheng had to say, the irregular heavy sword responded with a hint of joy as if to confirm what he felt.</p>

  <p>"I can understand your thirst for vengeance. I feel the same way," Zheng said as he smiled warmly while tightening his grip on the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>When he looked up, the Snake Spirit King had vanished from where he once stood.</p>

  <p>Without wasting a single moment, Zheng quickly passed the space of over ten thousand feet to close the distance between him and the Snake Spirit King. As if to assert his dominance over it, he raised the irregular heavy sword and pointed its end towards the Snake Spirit King's forehead.</p>

  <p>"Show me what you got," Zheng said as he challenged the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The surface of the irregular heavy sword suddenly cracked up.</p>

  <p>The sword itself was forged using fifteen pieces of Life Iron.</p>

  <p>Ever since it was brought back from the Deep Space by Kincaid, not once was it used up to its full potential.</p>

  <p>The reason was simple. For it to cultivate its maximum strength, it needed to absorb the bloodline power, but it was difficult for Kincaid to nurture it although he was powerful.</p>

  <p>But now, it was continuously absorbing Zheng's bloodline power. The high reserves of power contained within the complete ancestry-level was inexhaustible. It could absorb it to maintain its maximum strength without having to worry about it ever being depleted, making its overall strength second to none.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A vortex shaped energy appeared in the center of the fifteen pieces of Life Iron and sucked the huge body of the Snake Spirit King into it.</p>

  <p>"Destroy him!"</p>

  <p>Zheng moved swiftly and approached the Snake Spirit King at an incredible speed. In a fleeting moment, he activated the irregular heavy sword and released the vortex shaped energy in an instant.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King was not a small fly who would let Zheng's first move to decide his fate.</p>

  <p>The Limited Omnipotent Stone was completely focused on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Every detail of the way Zheng moved, such as how his hair danced to the rhythm of the wind, and how his heart beat faster every time he felt an adrenaline rush, constantly flowed into the Snake Spirit King's mind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Space Guiding Stone lit up and began to flicker with a blue light.</p>

  <p>"Endless Space!"</p>

  <p>Layers upon layers of space constantly appeared in an endless loop, enveloping the massive body of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Ten layers, a hundred layers, a thousand layers, ten thousand layers...</p>

  <p>As a Holy Item, the Space Guiding Stone had the absolute priority to utilize the energy of the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>When the stone began to use the power of the pillar, the countless Other Shore Tokens on the Other Shore began to dim down as though they were rid of their usual essence. They temporarily lost the support of the pillar.</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore Realm masters began to suspect a change in their Other Shore Tokens as they felt their energy drain out enough to make them useless. To substitute that lost energy in the Other Shore Tokens, they tried to inject some from the divine crystals. However, even the energy that the divine crystals harnessed disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>The Endless Space was solidified to an extended degree.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the vortex shaped energy touched it, the Snake Spirit King couldn't resist the pressure and was quickly swept into it by force, causing him to spin rapidly in the air.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he spun tens of thousands of times, and his long body kept on twisting and turning helplessly.</p>

  <p>At the same time, countless spiral cracks appeared on the surface of the Endless Space.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, three deafening sounds were heard, and the Endless Space was broken. Even so, the Snake Spirit King's body was still spinning against his will at a high speed. Even though his body had been twisted to pieces, it refused to halt its movement. It was as if it was a piece of cloth that was helplessly being swept away in the strong wind.</p>

  <p>"This sword..."</p>

  <p>Watching this scene unravel before his eyes, Zheng couldn't help but feel awestruck.</p>

  <p>Both he and the sword used the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, but the sword seemed to have a lot more knowledge than him about it, and even more so than the ancestry-level bloodline itself.</p>

  <p>The vortex that appeared to be nothing short of ordinary actually held such high reserves of power!</p>
