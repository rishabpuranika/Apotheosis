<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Normally, any girl would feel relieved and see a glimmer of hope after what Zheng had told her.</p>

  <p>But, Dorothy was different. Since she was born in a noble clan, her knowledge and understanding of the Sea of Truth and the Other Shore far surpassed that of other people.</p>

  <p>She knew Zheng was only trying to console her by sugarcoating the truth.</p>

  <p>"There's a silver lining to everything, except for this," Dorothy said with low spirits.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what lies in the center of the whirlpool?" Zheng asked while looking at her.</p>

  <p>Although Dorothy felt that Zheng's efforts to escape from the whirlpool were in vain, she still explained, "The center of the whirlpool is even more intense. It is said that it can devour anything. If we continue to stay here, we will eventually be drawn inside."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked lost in thoughts for a while. He caressed his chin with his fingers and spoke in a serious tone, "The problem must lie in the center of the whirlpool. I want to explore it."</p>

  <p>"You want to explore the center of the whirlpool? Are you serious?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy stood stunned as she looked at Zheng with curious eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng reassured her with a smile and said, "Don't forget, my soul is not the only thing that can enter the Sea of Truth."</p>

  <p>As she heard this, Dorothy lifted her gaze from the water and looked up at Zheng with beaming eyes. Her expression changed completely. It was like all traces of negative thoughts had disappeared from her face.</p>

  <p>None of the warriors who stepped into the Sea of Truth with their Souls of Light were able to escape from the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was a special person. Dorothy's grandmother had said that he was the only one who entered the Sea of Truth with his physical body over the years. Perhaps he was the only one who could get to the bottom of this.</p>

  <p>Maybe a reincarnation could solve this issue once and for all. But if there was a possibility of other ways, why would anyone want to give up everything and reincarnate?</p>

  <p>Zheng's decision gave her hope, but her eyes reflected a hint of worry. "No one has ever come out of the whirlpool alive."</p>

  <p>After Dorothy's cousin was drawn into the center of the whirlpool, he withdrew from the Sea of Truth. If he went back to the whirlpool, there was a chance of him getting sucked into the deep sea and never returning. The sea would absorb his Soul of Light and he would perish.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of the water of the Sea of Truth," Zheng said with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't help but feel slightly shocked by hearing the consequences from Dorothy.</p>

  <p>The most frightening thing about the whirlpool was the fact that it was capable of pulling the Souls of Light into the sea.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng could swim in the Sea of Truth, the whirlpool did not scare him at all.</p>

  <p>"Really?" A glimmer of hope shone through Dorothy's heart. She finally looked relieved.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was successful in using his physical body to escape from the whirlpool, not only could he save her cousin, but this could mean a great deal to the Source World.</p>

  <p>Many warriors who got trapped in the whirlpool did not choose to be reborn. They waited in anticipation for a way out.</p>

  <p>As consummate True Gods, their lifespan was far longer than a normal person. They could only hope one day, they would be able to escape from the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>"Wait for me!" Zheng said, signaling to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Then he moved his lips to cast the Illusion Breaking Rune to retreat from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>When he awoke, he glanced around to soak in his surroundings. The disciples of the cultivation palaces had already left the platforms where they observed the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>Only he, Elgin, and Beldene were left sitting on the platforms. The other two had just entered the Sea of Truth to explore it.</p>

  <p>Wasting no time, he jumped down from the platform. Soon, he captured the attention of everyone who now eyed him with a confused expression, among which were Laura and Ingram.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, with the strength of your Soul of Light, you should have been able to cross the second and third lines of the Sea of Truth by now. Why did you come out so quickly?" Laura asked with concern.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at her and said, "I have come across some trouble."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Ingram narrowed his eyes and asked with concern, "Did someone pick on you?"</p>

  <p>As far as he could remember, there was no natural hurdles in the first three sections of the Sea of Truth. The only problem that could have arisen was from the disciples of other sects.</p>

  <p>"No. I have learned something, so I wish to cultivate in seclusion elsewhere," Zheng replied with a serious look.</p>

  <p>He did not want to tell them that he had gotten himself trapped in a huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had made the whirlpool seem so terrifying that he was afraid he would only worry them had he told them the full truth.</p>

  <p>"Cultivate in seclusion?" They stared at him in bewilderment. For a consummate True God, choosing to cultivate in seclusion meant comprehending the Truth of Godly Way and crossing the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Ingram began to worry but he trusted Zheng and his judgments. He sighed and continued, "Okay, you can choose a secluded room to cultivate in the Sword Dance Palace. Let me take you there."</p>

  <p>Without wasting a second, Zheng nodded to Ingram and waved goodbye to Laura and the officiant. Then he turned around and hurried back to the Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>After he reached the backyard, he quickly found the secluded room and made his way inside. Upon entering the room, he began to focus and set up an enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Zheng wanted to keep the warriors of the Other Shore Realm from prying into what he intended to do. Never once had he thought he would go into the Sea of Truth with his physical body in the Sword Light Palace. But now it seemed like he had no other choice. It was all happening too fast. He had to act now.</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed and sat down with his legs crossed and gently stretched his hands forward. Soon, a red flame bloomed on the tip of his finger.</p>

  <p>He hadn't brought the red-eyed girl from the Abyss Demon Region with him. Her ability could only be used in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had used the red lotus flames the girl had materialized to burn his body. Before leaving for his journey from the divine land, he made a few arrangements. After a few trials, he learned that he needed to burn his entire body with the flames before entering the Sea of Truth with his body.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>With his arms stretched out, Zheng began performing the Elementary Fire Godly Way. The flames enveloped his entire body until he was fully engulfed in them. When the golden light on his body intensified, his surroundings started to change.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Zheng closed his eyes and focused harder. Soon after, he had teleported to the Sea of Truth. His body fell into it with a splash.</p>

  <p>He was now within the first section. The whirlpool was located somewhere in the middle of the first and second lines of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>As soon as he appeared, he heard someone exclaim not too far away,</p>

  <p>"Look! What is that? There's someone in the Sea of Truth!"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at them shortly and then looked away. Struggling with time, he started swimming forward using his hands to speed up.</p>

  <p>He had managed to cross the first section of the Sea of Truth with his body intact in his first attempt. There was no way the first section could stop him from progressing now.</p>

  <p>As he continued swimming forward, he passed by over a hundred Truth Boats that were lined up in a row.</p>

  <p>Loud cries echoed from the boats but he did not stop.</p>

  <p>Most people on the boats screamed out in concern. They couldn't believe their eyes when they saw Zheng swimming in the Sea of Truth with such ease.</p>

  <p>It caused their curiosity to rise.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, who was sitting on her Truth Boat, watched him approach her swiftly. When he came up to the edge of the whirlpool, she gestured him to stop with her hands. "Stop!"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng asked with a baffled expression while removing his hair from his face. Dorothy was several feet away from him.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you would never be able to get out once you go in," Dorothy said, looking worried.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave her a comforting smile and said, "I won't regret even if so!"</p>

  <p>As these words left his mouth, he quickly dived right into the edge of the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Dorothy clenched her heart subconsciously as it skipped a beat at Zheng's resolve.</p>
