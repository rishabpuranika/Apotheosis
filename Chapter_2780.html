<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2780 The Deadly Light Column </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The seventh stage of the Abyss Demon Region was the lair of the fiends.</p>

  <p>Originally, this had been the entire Abyss Demon Region, but as the years went on, the region had expanded all around this area.</p>

  <p>When the white column of light fell down from the sky, the temperature of the fiends' lair suddenly decreased.</p>

  <p>"Why is the temperature so low?"</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"What is that white light?"</p>

  <p>Apart from the several big fiends, the rest of the fiends, including the fiend commanders, didn't know what had happened.</p>

  <p>They were at a loss on seeing this abnormal phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack!</p>

  <p>A huge crack suddenly appeared on the surface of the Fiend Hall which was ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack...</p>

  <p>It was as if a giant invisible hand was tearing apart the Fiend Hall.</p>

  <p>The Fiend Hall was slashed into two in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>Seeing this bizarre scene made the ferocious Ghost Dogs feel an inexplicable fear, so they began roaring and howling loudly in their cages, wanting to escape.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>Some of the human women who had been imprisoned in the Fiend Hall were free now. However, they had been here for so long that they had forgotten how to escape; instead, they hid in the corners, shrieking in fear.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>In front of the Fiend Hall, a thin and transparent tip popped out of the flat square.</p>

  <p>As the square continued to crack, a transparent crystal palace rose out of the ground.</p>

  <p>However, this crystal palace was like the tip of the iceberg. It was only the entrance of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As the palace rose from underground, cold air enveloped the surface of the fiends' lair, forming a thin layer of ice.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>A beautiful human woman walked out of the collapsed door of the Fiend Hall.</p>

  <p>She set her feet on the thin layer of ice and glided to the front door of the palace.</p>

  <p>A stream of milky-white cold air followed her as she moved. In the meantime, a crystal throne appeared. She gently sat down on the throne and looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas rushed over from the gap and saw the dilapidated Fiend Hall, he frowned slightly and his eyes finally fell on the mysterious woman.</p>

  <p>After seeing her sitting so confidently on the throne, he immediately guessed that the fiends were probably under this woman's control.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he asked, staring intently at her.</p>

  <p>"You're too slow. I've been waiting for such a long time. Even the great fiends like Gallio aren't that strong, and it couldn't have been that difficult to kill them. Are you really considered the strongest Holy Being in the divine land?" the woman mocked. Then, she leaned back against the ice throne and gently shook her delicate head with disdain in her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"If I used my full strength, I could have killed Gallio on my own," said Nicholas as he stared at the woman with a gleam in his eyes. "But why does any of that matter to you?"</p>

  <p>The woman curled her lips and said in a cold but pleasant voice, "Of course it matters to me. You came to the Abyss Demon Region in order to control it, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Nicholas without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>In his opinion, whether he was facing a ferocious monster or a human being, as long as he could keep his opponent satisfied, there was no need to fight!</p>

  <p>"Do you know what is controlling the Abyss Demon Region?" the woman asked in a sweet voice, playing with a strand of her hair.</p>

  <p>No one could answer this question.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas had plotted for a long time in order to control the Abyss Demon Region, he didn't even know what the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region was like.</p>

  <p>Only after exploring the bottom of a forbidden area could one discover its secrets and control its weapon.</p>

  <p>For example, everyone had learned about the scepter in the Soul Wilderness only after Estelle had found it.</p>

  <p>Forget Nicholas, even the fiends hadn't known about it!</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes revealed a trace of pity. "You don't even know this. How dare you think about controlling the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>"Humph! Nobody has ever been to this damned place before. It's our first time here, so it's natural for us to not know that!" Clark yelled as he glared at the woman.</p>

  <p>Although the woman was gorgeous in appearance, she had an evil aura about her. With his temperament, Clark would normally have immediately smashed her with his bare hands. But now, he stayed still and followed what Nicholas had said.</p>

  <p>"Haha..."</p>

  <p>When the woman heard Clark's words, she gently pressed her legs together and pointed at Clark.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A bright white light shot down from the cloud in the sky.</p>

  <p>The last time this beam of light had come down, it had been very far away from the Holy Beings. All they had been able to see was a flash of light, so they hadn't taken it seriously at all.</p>

  <p>But now, the Holy Beings finally realized the amount of momentum contained in the light!</p>

  <p>It was simply an irresistible force.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of you!"</p>

  <p>Clark's eyes widened and he too began to fight fiercely.</p>

  <p>A flame shot out from his chest and enveloped his whole body.</p>

  <p>The burning heat surged around him so much that all the Holy Beings standing nearby had to dodge.</p>

  <p>"The Sacred Twilight Flame!"</p>

  <p>The flame that was coming out of Clark's chest consisted of three colors: red, purple, and black.</p>

  <p>The three colors were mixed together, emitting an unparalleled aggressiveness.</p>

  <p>The flames in the divine land were nurtured by the Elementary Fire Godly Way. As a result, they could form innumerable flames of various shapes, but in the end, all the flames had to submit to the tricolor flame.</p>

  <p>Even Holy Beings like Zeke and Murphy had fear on their faces when they saw the tricolor Sacred Twilight Flame.</p>

  <p>They had never expected Clark to secretly hide such a great theurgy.</p>

  <p>Clark might be more proficient in the Elementary Fire Godly Way than anyone else.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred Twilight Flame condensed, it spiraled into a vertical column of flame and shot straight into the falling column of light straightly.</p>

  <p>However, just at that moment, Nicholas reached out to grab Clark!</p>

  <p>When he reached out his hand to touch Clark, the Sacred Twilight Flame on Clark's chest was pushed away by a strange force. Then, Nicholas grasped Clark's clothes without any hindrance and pulled him abruptly to the side.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The falling column of light had completely eaten up the tricolor Sacred Twilight Flame without so much as slowing down.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas had pulled Clark away, it was too late; the light column grazed Clark's shoulder before hitting the ground.</p>

  <p>With a gentle stroke of the light column, Clark's right arm disappeared.</p>

  <p>The light column had quietly devoured both Clark's flame and his right arm.</p>

  <p>They never expected such an inconspicuous attack was fatal.</p>

  <p>As the woman observed this whole scene, her eyes were filled with ridicule, but she was still a little surprised. "Not bad. You are worthy of being the leader of these people after all. But do you know what's going to happen in a few seconds?"</p>
