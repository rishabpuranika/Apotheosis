<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2987 To Destroy The Tomb </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The soul force of the ghost continued to grow. As it increased gradually, so did its strength. Shortly after, it became as powerful as a warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>The fierce soul aura of the ghost surged violently throughout the cave, causing people to tremble in fear.</p>

  <p>"Clap! Clap!"</p>

  <p>The two fire chains holding the ghost collapsed in an instant!</p>

  <p>Its power was so terrifying that it dragged the two consummate True Gods across the ground like rag dolls. Showing no signs of mercy, it threw them in its mouth and broke their necks.</p>

  <p>The man in purple watched all this unravel in horror. His face changed color dramatically. He gently twisted his body in the air and moved backward in an attempt to retreat.</p>

  <p>Despite the intense atmosphere, the man in purple refused to panic. He remained calm and composed. It came as no surprise since he came from a noble clan.</p>

  <p>However, the ghost had no intention of letting him go. It wanted to feed on anything that moved. The ghost began charging towards the man at an alarming speed. It attempted to block the man's path by spreading its arms wide, leaving him nowhere to go.</p>

  <p>As he was cornered, the man's expression turned serious. He stared at the ghost with no hint of fear in his eyes. And then, a small seed exploded above his head!</p>

  <p>"The Latent Theurgy!"</p>

  <p>The man was a descendant of a large clan in the Gracious Province. His clan had made sure he remained unscathed. For his protection, they had planted the Latent Theurgy in case his life was ever in danger and he needed to make a quick escape.</p>

  <p>As the seed exploded, a shadow of a beautiful woman emerged from it. She curled her body and began to sing a strange song. It was like she was protecting the man from the ghost.</p>

  <p>As the woman sang, the sound waves surrounded the man's head like ripples. They continued to grow till they enveloped the man in the shape of a sphere with a radius of one hundred feet. The sphere acted as an impenetrable force field for him, keeping him away from harm.</p>

  <p>The ghost was ferocious and enraged. It continued its attempts to break through the sphere of sound. Every blow of the ghost formed waves on the sphere but failed to weaken it. It was almost invincible.</p>

  <p>The man in purple knew the sphere wouldn't hold for long, it came with a time limit. The Latent Theurgy would soon wear off. He knew he had to act fast. The internal momentum began to spread out of his body as he attempted to perform the Grand Teleportation technique in hopes of escaping from this place. But, the moment the space fluctuation condensed before him, the ghost let out a loud cry.</p>

  <p>The cry was so loud that it pierced through everyone's souls, and even Zheng felt dizzy. The people standing behind him screamed in agony as they could not endure it. Shortly after, the people rolled their eyes and collapsed on the ground. They covered their ears desperately but it was to no avail. It felt like their ears were bleeding from the sharp noise.</p>

  <p>The man in purple remained in the clutches of the ghost as it roared out.</p>

  <p>The sphere of sound was not able to block out the cries of the ghost, and the man screamed out in pain from the shrieking noise. When the noise reached towards his soul, a soul weapon planted in his chest shattered into pieces from the impact. Suddenly, the space channel he just formed scattered everywhere!</p>

  <p>The man in purple realized the ghost had bested him. His vision began to blur as his head felt dizzy from the aftereffects of the cry. Even so, he didn't give up. He gritted his teeth and continued to perform the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>However, when the space channel began to form again, the ghost let out another sharp cry.</p>

  <p>This time, the man's head hung loosely from his neck, He had passed out.</p>

  <p>The shadow of the woman above his head remained, and she continued to sing for his protection.</p>

  <p>But the Latent Theurgy could only be used once and it only lasted for a short while. Not long after, the shadow of the woman began getting dimmer and dimmer. Her tone of singing got lower and lower, till she was almost inaudible.</p>

  <p>Once the effects of the Latent Theurgy wore off, the man would be left vulnerable and at the mercy of the ghost.</p>

  <p>At this moment, No. 9527's voice resounded in Zheng's mind, "It's time to make a move!"</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current soul, he was unable to withstand the ghost. If it weren't for No. 9527's existence, he would have already left.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 continued to guide Zheng from his mind. It had told him that although the ghost was fierce, it relied on soul force that came from the tomb. If the tomb was destroyed, the ghost would perish along with it.</p>

  <p>Zheng listened intently at No. 9527's words. He then nodded to himself and began descending towards the tomb.</p>

  <p>As he approached the tomb, a sharp sword radiance appeared to emit from the cyan sword.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance was as bright as sunlight flickering at the hint of dawn.</p>

  <p>It carried immense power and dashed toward Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"It's... the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent?" Zheng's eyes widened as he stared at it with wonder.</p>

  <p>There was no way that the man in purple and his companions did not see the tomb.</p>

  <p>They had also initially planned on knocking down the tomb. However, it turned out to be an extremely powerful array, which was why they attempted to eliminate the ghost instead.</p>

  <p>As a warrior at the Other Shore Realm, the Stinger Guard had been dead for countless years.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent hidden in the cyan sword grew weak over time.</p>

  <p>Even today, the sword intent urged by the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent still couldn't be underestimated. It held overwhelming power within it. As Zheng flew close to the surface, he suddenly clapped his hands on the ground and turned his body to avoid the sword radiance. At the same time, the Soaring Snake Sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>"Ways-blending Strike!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed as he slashed at the sword radiance released from the cyan sword with the Ways-blending Strike which made his sword also emit sword radiance.</p>

  <p>The impact of the two rays of sword radiance clashing against each other was strong and loud. The sword radiance that burst out from their contact was as bright as the sun. With the strong surges of energy spreading far and wide, Zheng had no choice but to retreat and rush up again once the energy dissipated.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng began charging towards the tomb for another attempt, the woman singing above the man's head disappeared. The moment she left, the sphere of sound faded along with it. Without wasting a moment, the ghost swallowed the man whole.</p>

  <p>The noise coming from the tomb alerted the ghost and it turned its attention towards Zheng. It glared at him from a distance and watched him charge towards the tomb in an attempt to smash it. The ghost let out a wild scream.</p>

  <p>The tomb was its home and it was not going to allow anyone to touch it.</p>

  <p>As it screamed sharply, it quickly rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>It used its screams to destabilize Zheng till it reached him. The loud sound of shrieks made Zheng's soul tremble as it weakened. He struggled to charge forward trying his best to ignore it. It was not hard for him to beat ferocious beasts. But in this case, the ghost was all soul. It proved more challenging for him since his Soul of Light was far weaker compared to his body. He did not want to imagine the consequences of being caught by the ghost. He was in no position to give up either. He kept advancing despite the approaching threat.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng exerted all his remaining strength into performing the Truth of Cultivation Nature. He moved as gracefully as a swallow flying into the dense forest, dodging the sword radiance released by the cyan sword from time to time.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>As the cyan sword drew closer to him, a green light flickered on the surface of the ancient sword. A dozen of rays of sword radiance spread out in all directions, quickly turning into a net of the sword to envelop Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>As the net rushed to trap him and the ghost chased after him, Zheng became confused. He ultimately lost his balance while twisting his body, causing him to smash into the net.</p>

  <p>"Aaah!"</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a sting of pain as he supported his right shoulder with his left arm.</p>

  <p>He groaned in pain and struggled to get back on his feet. There was a deep wound on Zheng's right shoulder all the way to his back. Blood spilled out from his wound as he stumbled to maintain his balance.</p>

  <p>He looked ahead with a pained expression to see that the tomb was right in front of him. It was a small price to pay to get to his destination.</p>
