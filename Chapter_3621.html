  <p>
</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Hundreds of unicorns rushed towards the Evil God. If he were to be trapped underneath their stomping hooves, he would surely die.</p>

  <p>"Illusion Breaking Rune!"</p>

  <p>Signaled by his loud chant, his Soul of Light flashed brightly and tried to escape from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, the green thread firmly bound his Soul of Light to the Other Shore. As powerful as the Evil God was, he couldn't break the thread's hold.</p>

  <p>Once the Evil God saw the herd of unicorns draw closer with each gallop, various thoughts raced through his mind.</p>

  <p>Amid his despair, something unexpected happened— the herd rushed towards either side of the Evil God to avoid trampling him. It was almost as if they were frightened by something.</p>

  <p>"This..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God stared dumbfounded at the scene playing out before him. He had no idea what was happening.</p>

  <p>"The souls wandering on the Other Shore are too fragile. Haha..."</p>

  <p>A scornful voice mocked.</p>

  <p>A woman suddenly appeared not too far away from him, half of her body wrapped within a red ball.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" the Evil God asked, his voice severe.</p>

  <p>He had always gone on a rampage on the Other Shore. Apart from showing restraint on Stage Eleven, he portrayed even more aggressive than Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the woman in front of him gave him the feeling that she was probably the most threatening person he had met here!</p>

  <p>"Who am I? You don't have to know," she replied coldly.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, a powerful aura burst out of the Evil God's Soul of Light. The aura held a force that brought about an intent to kill, like a sword that eagerly waited to slash and slaughter.</p>

  <p>This aura would be enough to easily injure any opponent with an ordinary Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>This woman before him, on the other hand, was anything but ordinary. He made sure not to make a fool out of himself and proceeded with every interaction with her cautiously.</p>

  <p>He decided that he couldn't afford to provoke an opponent he knew nothing about and risk too much. The aura burst for a split second before dissipating as if it had never existed.</p>

  <p>This left the mysterious woman shocked.</p>

  <p>No ordinary person would have enough power to burst out such a killing intent.</p>

  <p>All who were qualified to enter the Chilling Bone Land possessed exceptional talents.</p>

  <p>This man had the power that qualified him to enter the Chilling Bone Land with the mere form of Soul of Light, perhaps he had immeasurable value, the woman thought.</p>

  <p>Remembering her leader's words, she sighed inwardly and finally replied,</p>

  <p>"You may call me Sienna. I've been ordered to escort you to the Chilling Bone Land."</p>

  <p>"Chilling Bone Land? What is that? Will it help me get rid of my position as the Inner-world Generating Avatar of another person?" he asked her all at once.</p>

  <p>As long as he was Zheng's Inner-world Generating Avatar, he wouldn't be able to live peacefully.</p>

  <p>If the place the woman mentioned was only about lucky chances to improve his strength or locations to hidden treasures, he could search for them on his own. What mattered more to him was an opportunity to escape the control of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Inner-world Generating Avatar..." After Sienna heard this, realization dawned on her. No wonder the leader asked her to take him to the Chilling Bone Land.</p>

  <p>Getting rid of the role of an Inner-world Generating Avatar would be difficult, but certainly not impossible in the Chilling Bone Land.</p>

  <p>Utilizing the Chilling Bone Land to solve the Evil God's problem would be feasible, but this would still be simply making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

  <p>"Will going there help me or not?" he asked as he stared at Sienna. He sensed hope in the expression she portrayed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it will help you," she nodded in assurance.</p>

  <p>The Evil God placed his defensive guard down. He even gave the woman a respectful bow before excitedly pleading, "If you'd be so kind as to lead me there, I'd be very grateful!"</p>

  <p>This was probably the only time he remembered acting so courteous to someone throughout his entire life.</p>

  <p>Slightly smug at the success of her offer, she replied, "Follow me to the upper stages."</p>

  <p>As the red ball wrapped around the lower part of her body began to float, she flew up to the mountain, the Evil God tailing behind her.</p>

  <p>Just as they arrived in front of the star ring, the Evil God's expression suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>Sienna turned around and noticed the strange change in the Evil God. "Is something wrong?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Someone is forcing me to wake up," the Evil God said nervously.</p>

  <p>This trip would help determine whether he could finally be free or not.</p>

  <p>Once extremely arrogant and fearless, the Evil God now found himself restrained and humbled by the opportunity.</p>

  <p>No one would normally wake up a warrior cultivating on the Other Shore unless a major change was about to occur or there was something of great importance to discuss.</p>

  <p>"You can make up an excuse. Tell them you've entered a temple and that you can't leave the Other Shore," Sienna suggested. Although she appeared to be compassionate, the truth was she just wanted to put aside her prejudice and get this task over with as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"That excuse won't be good enough." The Evil God shook his head. As soon as he entered the Myriad Spirits City, he had the feeling that Zheng had complete control over Stage Fourteen. Thus, such a lie would soon be exposed.</p>

  <p>"Then what do you want?" Sienna asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng couldn't perceive what the Evil God was doing on the Other Shore, he could still know it by reading his memories.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any methods to change one's memories?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>He possessed the ability to wipe out memories, as well.</p>

  <p>But there was one problem. Erasing memories would leave an obvious void within the Inner-world Generating Avatar's memories. This would likely cause Zheng to be more suspicious.</p>

  <p>Sienna shot the Evil God an impatient look. Reluctantly, she stuffed one of her arms into the red ball and pulled out what appeared to be a mini dipper.</p>

  <p>"This," she continued, "is the Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper. Whoever wields it has the power to create their own world within it— one that you can enter and change according to your will."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes flashed open as wide as saucers. Without hesitation, he leaped into the Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper.</p>

  <p>Then he began to build various memories in his mind— him exploring Stage Thirteen, him crossing the energy vortex, him exploring a temple on Stage Fourteen, and more. At the same time, he erased his real memories of the journey on the Other Shore to deceive Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was worried that it was Zheng who was trying to force him awake.</p>

  <p>But he was wrong. At the time, the blaring of horns echoed throughout the entire Land of Sword Grief and in turn activated the array in front of each cultivation room.</p>

  <p>Once activated, they woke up the people that resided within each secret cultivation room.</p>

  <p>The disciples who were cultivating in seclusion or just roaming the Other Shore were all awakened.</p>

  <p>Save for a few disciples who were within the temples and were unable to part from the Other Shore, those other disciples on the first to the third floor walked out of their cultivation rooms upon hearing the horns.</p>

  <p>Zheng had long retreated from the Other Shore and had been studying the Civilization Artifact of the human race.</p>

  <p>At the sound of the blaring horns, he raised his eyebrows and then proceeded to open the door to his cultivation room. He witnessed many of the second-floor disciples gathering in the corridor with worried faces.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Are they gathering all the people in the Land of Sword Grief?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's not that simple..."</p>

  <p>The Land of Sword Grief's disciples were powerful forces in the Oneness Sky Palace. This meant that they could enjoy a quite relaxed environment for cultivation here.</p>

  <p>As long as they could finish the challenge at the beginning of the month, they were free to come and go whenever they pleased. So to see them all gathered in one place was an unusual sight.</p>

  <p>In the cultivation rooms on the third floor, the doors were opened.</p>

  <p>There were only a dozen disciples on the third floor. Even outside the Oneness Sky Palace, these people were fully capable of fighting and defending themselves.</p>

  <p>Even they appeared concerned upon hearing the horns.</p>

  <p>"Click..."</p>

  <p>To the far right of the third floor, the door to the No.1 cultivation room opened. A woman donning a plain robe walked out.</p>
