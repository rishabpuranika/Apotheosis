<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3396 The Clanging Sound </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the other four members of the Nine Li race sensed that Zheng, Hutton and Sally had banded together, they set out for the eastern peak at a breakneck pace.</p>

  <p>Luckily, they had safely crossed the periphery of the Chaotic Source World, and were close to the core area. Umar was the furthest away. He was near the western peak, but was moving towards them now.</p>

  <p>Right now, all the super forces that had entered the Chaotic Source World were gathering together.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race gathered on the western peak, the Separate Abyss race on the northern peak, and some minor races on the southern peak.</p>

  <p>When Zheng, Dorothy, Elvinia and the others approached the eastern peak, more than ten Ear Mice suddenly emerged from a large hole near them.</p>

  <p>All of the Ear Mice were half as tall as a person. Each of them had a strong aura, and their black soybean-sized eyes reflected shrewdness.</p>

  <p>"Master Zheng, I'm Darth. I've waited a long time." The long-haired Ear Mouse in the lead walked over to Zheng and raised its paws to salute him.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the Ear Mice. It seemed that they wanted something from him. He asked, "You were waiting for me here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Darth.</p>

  <p>"How did you know where I was?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>No one knew where they would be after the hurricane came and stopped.</p>

  <p>Zheng was naturally suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Darth put its paw to its mouth and blew, creating a strangely-pitched whistle. Not far away, tiny mice emerged from fist-sized caves.</p>

  <p>Darth laughed and said, "The Chaotic Source World is teeming with lives.</p>

  <p>The Rock Mice serve us."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice weren't that powerful compared to the other races, but they were unparalleled when it came to spying.</p>

  <p>The Rock Mice of the Chaotic Source World also worked for them.</p>

  <p>"I see." A look of relief appeared on Zheng's face as he asked, "What do you want from me?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had once allied himself with the Ear Mice on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Although the Ear Mice had failed to explore the Grand Sky Temple, and had even been drained of strength, it was not Zheng's fault. Moreover, Zheng sent back the souls of the Ear Mice that had transformed into cubs.</p>

  <p>"I have a proposition," said Darth. "Let's explore the eastern peak together."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice thought Zheng was a good guy to have around in a fight.</p>

  <p>Although they couldn't prove that Zheng was really Tianxing, it sure looked like they were the same person. Even if they weren't, the mice figured that there must be some connection between the two men.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Chaim, Elvinia and the others looked at each other, and they nodded their assent.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were a race that could not be ignored. The information they acquired was extremely useful. It seemed foolish not to take them up on their offer.</p>

  <p>However, Darth was a little worried about Zheng's suspicious attitude as it stared at Zheng with its soybean-like eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's an honor to be with you," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, the Ear Mice heaved a collective sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>The Rock Mice that lived in the Chaotic Source World were very weak.</p>

  <p>When the hurricane started blowing, they burrowed deep into the mountain caverns, so they didn't see Zheng kill the nonhuman creatures from the Divine Lair and Adonis from the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>However, with all the information they gathered, they could come to that conclusion easily.</p>

  <p>But they were confused. How did Zheng kill those creatures when the hurricane raged all around him?</p>

  <p>More incredibly, Zheng returned to where he had been after the battle, which meant he could fly against the hurricane.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were itching to solve the mystery, but it was considered rude to ask him outright. Zheng might not be willing to tell them, so they had to fight down the urge to ask.</p>

  <p>Maybe he would reveal more secrets if they were exploring together as allies.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was preparing for another journey, Zheng asked, "The Rock Mice work for you? That's pretty handy. I want to know where two certain individuals are. Can you help me out?"</p>

  <p>Darth gave a smile and squeaked, "Let me guess. You want to know where Yan and the Evil God are. Right, Master Zheng?"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were quite shrewd. They knew exactly who Zheng was talking about. They even knew the young man in black was called the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Apparently, the Pear Hill knew of the change in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>They have been prepared for the violent hurricane and they're on the western peak. The Evil God is in the north," Darth replied.</p>

  <p>"Is he heading for the northern peak?" Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>An indescribable expression appeared on Darth's face. "No, he's got murder on his mind."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had never seen such a bloodthirsty person. The Evil God was not interested in the Chaotic Source Spirit at all. The only thing he did in the Chaotic Source World was kill anyone he came across. Nobody could stop him.</p>

  <p>He had killed many important figures. These people were the first-class talents of the major races.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God had killed so many, he never stopped. Now he was going through the members of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>But it was a good thing for the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had killed many of their enemies, and they could avoid the Evil God with the help of the Rock Mice.</p>

  <p>"The members of the Separate Abyss race are quite powerful. The Evil God..." Zheng remarked, frowning.</p>

  <p>Each member of the Separate Abyss race possessed superb vitality and strength, not to mention a sturdy corporeal body. The race was domineering and powerful and couldn't be ignored.</p>

  <p>"But those guys are in dire straits now," Darth said, shaking its head.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the northern peak, blood ran like a stream through the gap in the rock.</p>

  <p>The men and women of the Separate Abyss race were over 100 feet tall, like giants. After more than a dozen of them were torn apart, blood continued to seep out and flowed like a river.</p>

  <p>On the hillside, four members of that race still stood. They were the strongest, the best of the best. They were the top talents in theurgy, body and Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>They stared at the Evil God hovering in the air. Their leader coldly asked,</p>

  <p>"We have nothing against you. Why kill us like this?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" An aura of malice surrounded the Evil God as he smiled. "I want to hear the clanging sound. That sound is pleasing to the ear and gets me all excited."</p>

  <p>The clanging sound? What was that?</p>

  <p>The four members of the Separate Abyss race looked at each other, puzzled.</p>

  <p>They couldn't understand what the Evil God meant.</p>

  <p>"That sound is a special one. It tolls when one gains a reward. It means I'm growing stronger. Hahaha..." As the Evil God spoke, he suddenly waved his hands and a black void materialized, enveloping the four members of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The four members were very powerful. They couldn't be dealt with by normal means, so the Evil God had to show his trump card.</p>

  <p>When the black void descended, the voice of the Evil God came again.</p>

  <p>"Don't fight it. You're too weak to comprehend what's happening. Go to hell!"</p>
