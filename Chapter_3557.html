<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the light fell from the air, a visible shock wave surged in all directions.</p>

  <p>The light penetrated everything that dared cross its path, forming a mighty column that pierced through the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Just as the circle of shock wave spread out, Luo Zheng grabbed hold of Feng Ge and quickly flew away from the site of destruction.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge held on tight to Luo Zheng. "What kind of method is that? How can it be so powerful?" she exclaimed, eyes wide with shock.</p>

  <p>Both she and the stage ruler were purified beings but this method was completely unknown to her. True, she could control the Great Sanskrit Light at will but never to this extent.</p>

  <p>"How do you expect me to know if even you don't know?" Luo Zheng laughed bitterly, making sure that his grip on her was tight so that she wouldn't fall.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler snorted coldly when he failed to hit Luo Zheng. His light wings flashed behind him and he immediately flew towards Luo Zheng at top speed. As he flew, rays of light gathered and spread from his chest in a spiral pattern.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge pointed to the sky in panic.</p>

  <p>"It's coming!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she shouted her warning, the light wave from the stage ruler's chest shot straight towards them!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The earth trembled as the light wave descended.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt the terrifying pressure without even turning his head. With gritted teeth, he willed himself to go even faster, the thunder wings on his back cracking as he accelerated.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>As the light wave descended, the shock wave spread along the Dark Region, completely annihilating everything in its path.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved Feng Ge in front of him and used his back to block the shock wave force while using it as a boost to go even faster.</p>

  <p>It was a high-speed chase between Luo Zheng's thunder wings and the stage ruler's imposing light wings.</p>

  <p>While this chase went on, the creatures of the Dark Region worried greatly for their lives.</p>

  <p>The shock wave from the light column would destroy everything in its path within a ten-mile radius. What made them even more terrified was the stage ruler's wings that constantly released Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>Wherever Luo Zheng and the stage ruler went, destruction surely followed as sections of the Dark Region eroded in the presence of such imposing light.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's wings plowed out an ever growing ditch more than two hundred feet wide and thirty miles long.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also felt the great pressure from the light wave.</p>

  <p id="top_13">He had no doubt that the power of this light wave was beyond the limit of his physical body. If the Chaotic Source Spirits were to be exhausted, then Luo Zheng could face the possibility of being seriously injured or even dying.</p>

  <p>"Be careful on the left!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge reminded him.</p>

  <p>"It's at the right rear!"</p>

  <p>He immediately flew towards the left to dodge the light waves but the stage ruler suddenly flipped and overtook Luo Zheng. It was with great shock that Luo Zheng suddenly found the stage ruler in front of him, especially when he suddenly opened his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>A long, thin tongue came out of his mouth and headed towards Luo Zheng at high speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng never thought in a million years that the stage ruler would attack him with his tongue. He immediately threw Feng Ge away, not wanting to involve her in whatever their opponent had in store for them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but wonder if the stage ruler wanted to use his tongue to grab him and pull him towards his mouth. He shivered at the thought of being eaten. However, once the tongue reached him, it didn't wrap around his body like he expected, but instead, it drew back and hit him ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The force was enough to send Luo Zheng flying right into the light wave.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's body was enveloped by the light, it popped and shone brightly.</p>

  <p>The light had formed into a ball that slowly descended from the sky. A trace of cold satisfaction appeared on the stage ruler's face. It took a lot out of him to deal with this human.</p>

  <p>Natalie could only look at this scene with distress. "Luo Zheng," she muttered. "He might be truly defeated this time."</p>

  <p>Yan couldn't say anything, also overwhelmed by what had just happened.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng threw Feng Ge away, the young woman landed hard onto the ground. However, the pain was completely overwhelmed with a strong feeling of sadness and worry when she saw what happened to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It took twelve whole seconds for the light ball to descend and gradually fade away.</p>

  <p>In its spot was a large crater where a creature lay.</p>

  <p>It was the same size as a human being, but its appearance was utterly horrendous with spikes extending from its back and a tail that sprouted from its bottom.</p>

  <p>"What is this? Where's Luo Zheng?" Natalie asked, her eyes filled with panic at what she saw.</p>

  <p>Yan could only stare at the monster in confusion. "Where's my brother?" she also wailed.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was rendered speechless from the shock of seeing Luo Zheng in such a form. She had to blink a few times to make sure she wasn't seeing things.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just them. Even the stage ruler was shocked at the result of his own attack.</p>

  <p>He descended into the crater and landed just a couple of steps away from the monster. "Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Just as they were ruminating on their confusion, the monster's limbs suddenly sprang up.</p>

  <p>It took the opportunity of its opponent's vulnerability and launched an attack. Before the stage ruler had a chance to spread his wings and fly away, the monster had already stuck itself to his body.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's skin was rough and thick. When Luo Zheng threw a javelin at him before, the javelin failed to even break through the outer layer. However, this monster managed to pierce through him by just using the spikes on its tail.</p>

  <p>Panic danced behind the stage ruler's eyes. He waved a sharp claw at his opponent but the monster was surprisingly agile and avoided his attack. The stage ruler didn't even get the chance to move away as the monster's tail stiffened and stabbed his neck.</p>

  <p>Not satisfied, the monster drew its tail back and once again let the black spikes pierce through the stage ruler's abdomen.</p>

  <p>It took three consecutive stabs before the monster left his body alone and let him plop down onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a strange thing happened to the stage ruler's body.</p>

  <p>Three rays of green light began to spread from his chest, his neck, and his abdomen.</p>

  <p>As the light spread, his black thick skin softened and disintegrated into green mud.</p>

  <p>"What is this? What kind of poison is this?" the stage ruler screamed.</p>

  <p>He knew his body was strong, so there was no way any ordinary poison would have this type of effect.</p>

  <p>In his desperation, the stage ruler activated the Great Sanskrit Light and set it to the maximum in order to try and refill his body with energy.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, no matter how powerful his technique was, it proved ineffective in curing his poisoning.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The stage ruler panicked and flew into the air, roaring in the sky.</p>

  <p>However, his struggle was futile. It only took about thirty seconds for him to exhaust himself and fall onto the cold, hard ground. The light wings on his back dimmed and his aura completely disappeared in a flash.</p>

  <p>When he fell, the darkness that had once been dispersed began to close in.</p>

  <p>Before the place was completely shrouded, Feng Ge waved her hand and a ray of white light fell from the sky to illuminate the vicinity.</p>

  <p>She made her way towards the monster that now crawled on the ground.</p>

  <p>She stopped just a couple of paces away, careful not to startle it. "Luo Zheng?" she called out.</p>

  <p>This monster's outline was blurry, so it might have entered the Other Shore with its physical body like Luo Zheng did. However, it was simply too different from Luo Zheng's appearance.</p>
