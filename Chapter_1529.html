<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were also some strong masters scattered among the warriors on the city wall, and some of them were even stronger than Layne.</p>

  <p>Compared to the furious and excitable Layne, these masters were much calmer and more composed.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had killed Layne for the first time and had obtained his 140, 000 Illusion Points, there were also some strong warriors on the walls who couldn't resist the impulse and wanted to leave the city to immediately challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They were all constantly evaluating Luo Zheng's strength, and there were even a few ogre warriors among them who secretly negotiated with each other to attack Luo Luo Zheng together, believing that a team effort might win the day.</p>

  <p>However, they all felt in their warrior hearts that Luo Luo Zheng was an unfathomable and formidable adversary, so they eventually gave up on this idea, choosing to wait instead.</p>

  <p>When they saw that Layne had been killed by Luo Luo Zheng for the second time, they all heaved a collective sigh of relief. Fortunately, they hadn't leaped into action to attack Luo Luo Zheng just now. They also could see that Luo Luo Zheng was in a state of extreme readiness and wanted to fight and kill them...</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had so easily dealt with Layne, his actual strength which remained hidden was likely much more than what they had seen. People always feared what they couldn't see or understand, and Luo Luo Zheng was a mystery to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still floating in the air with a faint smile ghosting on his face. In the eyes of the many gathered warriors, his smile seemed even more unfathomable and mysterious.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a figure dashed madly towards Luo Luo Zheng from the city, howling as he went. It was Layne, who had been killed twice already by Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Being killed twice by Luo Luo Zheng was an unforgivable mistake in Layne's eyes.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Layne was in a blind rage, as indignation and outrage had uncontrollably consumed him!</p>

  <p>This was also the main difference between a warrior from the Upper World and a warrior from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>The resources and even the vitality between heaven and earth of the warriors from the Lower World were hardly comparable to those of warriors from the Upper World. So in order to escape from the great world and fly into the Upper World, the Lower World's warriors had to put in far more effort than warriors of the Upper World had to invest.</p>

  <p>For example, the Soul Sea Realm warriors could be called masters in the Lower World. They were already considered the most powerful warriors in the great worlds. The amount of time they spent reaching the Soul Sea Realm was also countless times more than the amount of time the Upper World's warriors spent. This required a much more advanced level of dedication.</p>

  <p>As for the talented ogre like Layne, he was born when the world of chaos had begun and he was able to cultivate countless times faster than warriors did in the past. His warrior spirit hadn't gone through the test of time, and he had also encountered very few dangers which would have molded and shaped his warrior spirit. Although his strength was far greater than that of those who had ascended from the Lower World, his mental state was inferior to that of the warriors who flew into the Upper World. He lacked the experience that they had earned the hard way.</p>

  <p>Layne would, of course, not accept the fact that he had been defeated by Luo Luo Zheng twice like that. He was like an angry beast, a bear with a sore paw! It didn't matter if he had lost his Illusion Points, and what he needed to do was to vent his anger. Like a child throwing a tantrum, he wanted to tear Luo Luo Zheng into pieces in order to vent the anger in his heart!</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Facing the incensed roars of Layne, the gathered warriors on the city wall made way for him and watched him jump up to the city wall. Then, gaining momentum, he rushed out over the city wall again!</p>

  <p>When he had completed this series of actions, he hadn't even locked onto his original target...</p>

  <p>Some of the stronger warriors hiding in the crowd quietly sighed when they saw this irrational display. If Layne could be able to suppress his anger, he would still have a chance at victory when fighting Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Currently, his warrior spirit was in chaos. So if he rushed out in this condition, he would only be killed by Luo Luo Zheng and end up losing his remaining Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Things happened as expected...</p>

  <p>After Layne had rushed out over the city wall, he suddenly discovered that Luo Luo Zheng had disappeared.</p>

  <p>In his rage, he had only wanted to leave the city first and then kill Luo Luo Zheng, but he didn't pay attention or notice where Luo Luo Zheng was!</p>

  <p>Just as he floated in the air in a confused daze, Luo Zheng's faint voice rang out.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was floating above Layne's head. His gaze was indifferent, and the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand flashed forward with a blue arc of light...</p>

  <p>"I agree with you saying that you're a 'wolf'," Luo Luo Zheng said as a smile appeared on his face. As he spoke, he raised the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. "However, at best, you're just a weak wolf!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Luo Zheng's long sword viciously slashed downward!</p>

  <p>However, when the sword blade reached the back of Layne's neck, it tilted slightly, and Luo Luo Zheng used one side of the sword blade to pat Layne's neck in an almost friendly manner! He used the sword like a bat, beating a ball!</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>A clear sound rang out, accompanied by a muffled groan from Layne.</p>

  <p>Then Layne shot downward rapidly, and was just about to smash into the ground.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Luo Luo Zheng took a step forward and his figure suddenly disappeared, only to reappear a moment later below Layne. Luo Luo Zheng had crossed the space in the blink of an eye, and raising his head to look at Layne who was falling down, he raised his sword once again. "You said before that I'm a weak 'sheep', but I can't agree with that!"</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Luo Luo Zheng once again struck out with his sword, swinging the sword's profile towards the still falling Layne!</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the crisp and loud sound of metal striking matter, Layne rolled in the air and was launched towards the sky at the same time...</p>

  <p>After having been hit twice by Luo Luo Zheng, Layne was also now scared witless.</p>

  <p>Although he had clearly heard Luo Zheng's voice, he didn't even have the chance to say anything in response!</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had swatted Layne like a ball, his figure flashed once again and he took a step forward. His body again appeared above Layne and he uttered with a smile on his face, "I am not as weak as a sheep. But it is possible that I am also not a wolf... I am the lion that eats wolves!"</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had finished speaking, a gleam of light flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng did not pull his punches, and a decisive Mu Ning burst forth from his long sword. Luo Luo Zheng himself had also turned into a ruthless god of killings! The game was over, and Luo Luo Zheng turned the cutting edge of the great sword to Layne.</p>

  <p>A sword light containing a terrifying sword intent shot straight towards Layne!</p>

  <p>Up until now, Layne had been like a plaything to Luo Luo Zheng. How could Layne still have any room to resist while Luo Luo Zheng kept on swatting him?</p>

  <p>With this one murderous slash, Luo Luo Zheng slaughtered Layne for the third time!</p>

  <p>This kind of thing was quite odd to witness and the city walls' warriors could only watch in a stunned silence!</p>

  <p>After all, the warriors in the Illusion Battlefield were nor far away from their main cities, and if they could not resist others' attacks, they could escape to hide in the main city. No one would be so silly to rush out thrice in a row to let someone kill them again and again. It was ludicrous.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he had succeeded in defeating Layne three times, and had reaped great rewards!</p>

  <p>By killing Layne, Luo Luo Zheng had obtained 140, 000 Illusion Points for the first time, 70, 000 Illusion Points for the second time, and 35, 000 points for the third time... Adding up the previous Illusion Points he had gained before, the number of his Illusion Points had already reached 310, 000!</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng once again checked his ranking.</p>

  <p>After he had absorbed the Illusion Points from Layne, Luo Zheng's ranking had rapidly improved!</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Luo Zheng only had 70, 000 Illusion Points and was ranked 410, 000th in this supreme world, and in the entire Illusion Battlefield, he had previously only ranked 19, 000, 000th!</p>

  <p>But at this time, Luo Luo Zheng was already ranked around 80, 000th in this supreme world, and in the entire Illusion Battlefield his ranking now nearly reached 3, 900, 000. This was also the first time that Luo Luo Zheng had made it into the top 5 million!</p>

  <p>In the outside world, people only paid attention to the warriors who were ranked among the top five million...</p>

  <p>Those who were able to join the top 5 million warriors of one hundred thousand supreme worlds could be regarded as outstanding warriors.</p>

  <p>After all, they belonged to the top 5 million warriors among trillions of warriors. It was quite an accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng was much more remarkable than others, and merely describing him as excellent was obviously a bit inappropriate. The reason why he hadn't won a much higher ranking yet was simply because the speed at which he collected the Illusion Points had slowed down a bit...</p>

  <p>At this moment, all the warriors of the Mist Palace were gathered in front of the pyramid, staring at the countless names from which the pyramid was formed.</p>

  <p>"The one who retains first place is still Nathan Xuanyuan from the Thoughtless Minds!"</p>

  <p>"Nathan Xuanyuan is the Godly Genius of the Thoughtless Minds! It's been said that he has relied on the great skill of Supreme Lord of Original Sin to swallow a Heavenly Fragment and has therefore successfully endured the great suffering in his heart caused by the internal momentum. He indeed has the strength to rank first!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, our Mist Palace's warriors don't seem to have achieved great results, and none of them is outstanding! Up until now, not a single warrior has entered the top 10, 000! Layla is actually ranked around 110, 000th... I never thought that Javier's performance would be better than hers, but he's actually entered the top 80, 000!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be so anxious. This is only the beginning. Luo Luo Zheng has also not appeared yet, right?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't even found Luo Zheng's name so far!"</p>

  <p>"I found Luo Luo Zheng! He is ranked 3, 930, 000th! He has just entered into the top 5 million!" a warrior from the Mist Palace shouted in excitement.</p>

  <p>When Yolande, who had been silent all this time, heard those words, her eyes suddenly lit up brightly.</p>

  <p>Since the opening of the Illusion Battlefield, Luo Luo Zheng had completely disappeared. Yolande had even suspected that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't entered the Illusion Battlefield! Now that she had finally heard Luo Zheng's name for the first time, Yolande was greatly relieved.</p>

  <p>She trusted Luo Luo Zheng. As long as he entered the Illusion Battlefield, he would definitely strive to achieve a good result!</p>

  <p>"He is only ranked 3, 930, 000th... What on earth is he trying to do?" someone grumbled in dissatisfaction. Regardless of the other fighters,</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's performance was completely inconsistent with the great performance he had delivered in the Passing the Torch!</p>
