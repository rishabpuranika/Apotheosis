<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 86 Bluesky Parking Ground (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Most of the disciples were dressed in black robes, and only a few wore white robes. Everyone looked powerful and aggressive. Apparently, they had been forged in the sea of blood and had improved their power through life and death experience.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether it was an outer disciple in a white robe or an inner disciple in a black robe, when they saw Luo Luo Zheng, astonishment flashed in their eyes.</p>

  <p>What surprised them was not that there was anything special about Luo Luo Zheng, but that he was only at the marrow refining level. His cultivation level was too low for this task.</p>

  <p>The mission of shielding against the insect aggression was not easy. For starters, blade locusts attacked in large numbers. If that wasn't daunting enough, each locust was extremely strong. What was scarier was that they didn't fear death. Even in the face of several strong men, many desperate blade locusts would dash ahead and lay siege on their enemies regardless of their safety.</p>

  <p>Even a cultivator who was a half step into the nature level was likely to be killed by the blade locusts if he didn't pay attention to their siege.</p>

  <p>So the minimum eligibility for accepting this task was that the disciple be a half-step cultivator into the nature level.</p>

  <p>But now a person at the marrow refining level had been accepted for the task. It was thus, normal for them to have such a strange reaction.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng ignored the astonished look on these people. He found a corner on the Bluesky Parking Ground, sat down, and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Opposite Luo Luo Zheng stood four or five inner disciples. As they whispered among each other, they shot several glances at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Their voices were neither too loud nor too low. It was just at the right level for Luo Luo Zheng to hear clearly. Apparently, they were speaking at that level on purpose.</p>

  <p>"Since when can a cultivator at the marrow refining level accept such a dangerous mission?"</p>

  <p>"There are many different kinds of people in the world. It is folly to assume that some people are in a hurry to find a way to die. Some people simply overestimate themselves."</p>

  <p>"Hey, I'm going to tease him!"</p>

  <p>After making that statement, one disciple walked toward Luo Luo Zheng. The tall, strong man strolled up to Luo Luo Zheng, studied him up and down, and said, "Hey, boy, are you going to kill blade locusts, too?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes, stared at the strong man, and said, "Is there a problem?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha," the strong man gave out a queer laugh. "You're just at the marrow refining level. Considering your strength, I'm afraid you'll be split into two by the blade locusts!"</p>

  <p>"Oh," Luo Luo Zheng answered simply. Then he closed his eyes again.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's reaction, the strong man knew that his intimidation did not seem to have any effect. He took a closer look at Luo Luo Zheng and saw the token on his waist. He stretched forth his hand to take the token.</p>

  <p>Just as the strong man was about to grab the token, Luo Zheng's eyes flew open.</p>

  <p>Quickly, he grasped the strong man's arm. In the next moment, Luo Luo Zheng used the momentum of his body to position himself behind the strong man agilely. Before the disciple could blink, Luo Luo Zheng had grabbed him by his neck and pressed the broken flying knife against his neck.</p>

  <p>Although the knife was broken, it looked sharp, as if it could cut anything in the world. The strong man shivered as the cold from the flying knife's blade spread through his body.</p>

  <p>The strong man's friends were frightened when they saw this. They did not expect the unremarkable boy to be fierce enough to defeat the strong man in a blink.</p>

  <p>"Hey, bro, we're all disciples of Cloud Sect. Don't hurt him, please."</p>

  <p>"Take it easy, boy, Gordon was just joking!"</p>

  <p>The strong man's friends tried to placate Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is he acquainted with me? Why did he want to take my token?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a straight face.</p>

  <p>One of Gordon's friends said, "I'm sorry. This is all Gordon's fault. Let him go, please. He meant no harm. Gordon, come on, make an apology quickly."</p>

  <p>Gordon had never been more scared in his life. He could feel that Luo Luo Zheng was intent on killing him. If he had really attacked this boy, Gordon would have been dead by now. His voice trembled as he said, "I'm ... I'm sorry. I was just kidding. I didn't mean to offend you."</p>

  <p>Hearing Gordon's words, Luo Luo Zheng took away his knife and put it back in the space ring. He took a few steps back without saying a word. However, his expression conveyed the skepticism he was feeling.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had become a disciple of the Cloud Sect, he had not stopped being vigilant. Since stepping into Cloud Sect, many people had secretly plotted against him. These experiences helped Luo Luo Zheng understand that the law of the jungle was still being followed in this holy land of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Big fish ate little fish. If he wanted to survive, he needed to get stronger.</p>

  <p>The strong man sighed with relief when Luo Luo Zheng stepped back. Gently, he touched his neck with his hands. Then he looked at Luo Luo Zheng with admiration.</p>

  <p>Gordon wasn't the kind of person to hold a grudge. As he looked at Luo Luo Zheng, a broad smile spread across his face. He said, "Hi, my name is Gordon.</p>

  <p>The five of us are a team. We specialize in hunting blade locusts. The blade locusts prefer to attack in groups. So if you are alone, you will be in trouble."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't respond to the strong man's words.</p>

  <p>The strong man continued, "Well, to tell you the truth, if you want to hunt for blade locusts, you'd better team up with a few people to avoid being surrounded by the blade locusts. Why don't you join us?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rejected his suggestion with an emphatic shake of his head, "Thanks, I'm used to being alone."</p>

  <p>After that Luo Luo Zheng looked for another corner. After having found a quiet place, he sat down and closed his eyes again.</p>

  <p>The scene had attracted the attention of many people on the ground.</p>

  <p>Most people put aside their contempt, including some of the inner disciples who were stepping into the nature level. Seriousness gleamed in their eyes.</p>

  <p>All cultivators liked to put themselves in a hypothetically dangerous situation. They wondered if they could have avoided Luo Zheng's flying knife had they been in the strong man's position.</p>

  <p>Most people already knew that they couldn't. Luo Zheng's reaction was too quick, and his knife was too sudden.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng had better things to do than try to figure out why these disciples were staring at him and what they were thinking about. As he meditated, Luo Luo Zheng heard a trembling sound in the air. When he looked up, he saw a monolith descending from the sky.</p>

  <p>It was a giant flying chariot.</p>
