<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3397 Gaining Nothing </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The mountains at the foot of the eastern peak formed a natural, flat path.</p>

  <p>There, Luo Zheng had the members of his team stop for some time.</p>

  <p>Through the soul marks, he could sense the four members of the Nine Li race, including Umar, were approaching him.</p>

  <p>About 15 minutes later, three joined his team. The last one, however, didn't get close. He seemed to have been blown by the hurricane about a hundred thousand miles away.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to wait for Oswald. Let's go," Hutton said decisively.</p>

  <p>In the Chaotic Source World, everyone could reach the Chaotic Source Realm by virtue of their own strength. There was no way so many of them could just stop and wait for a single person.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Darth raised its paws and whistled, causing hundreds of Rock Mice to crawl out from both sides of the mountain path. They scurried into the cave below the eastern peak at its command.</p>

  <p>As the Rock Mice led the way, they could detect not only the danger in front of them but also the general direction of the Chaotic Source Spirits. It was indeed convenient.</p>

  <p>That was why all the large races preferred traveling with the Ear Mice. But this time, the Ear Mouse race found Luo Zheng of their own accord and joined him.</p>

  <p>The cave in the eastern peak was wide open with a flat passageway that spiraled upward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked to the front and spread his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>In the face of some protruding rocks and pillars, Luo Zheng and his people hit them with all their strength.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>After several tries, they found it rather easy to break the rocks and pillars into pieces. As it turned out, there was no Chaotic Source Spirit at this place.</p>

  <p>Squeak? "Master Luo Zheng, these Rock Mice look weak, but they can bite and break common rocks. The Chaotic Source Spirits exist in the rocks that they can't break," Darth reminded.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng scanned the nearby rocks, he found tiny teeth prints left by the Rock Mice.</p>

  <p>Clearly, Luo Zheng hadn't completely believed what the Ear Mouse had just told him.</p>

  <p>If they discovered any Chaotic Source Spirits, they could simply hide them from the public and come back to take them away later.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it said that most of the Chaotic Source Spirits gather in the five peaks?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Even Darth was puzzled. "That is indeed the case. There should be many Chaotic Source Spirits even at the entrance. But it looks like something went wrong this year?"</p>

  <p>The Rock Mice seemed to be searching for the Chaotic Source Spirits rapidly. They bit and dug into rocks all the way down into the cave so as to not miss any. Although in theory, they should have confronted some powerful ones by now, they hadn't met any such one yet.</p>

  <p>After spiraling over a hundred thousand feet up the cave, they couldn't find a single Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>It was an odd situation indeed.</p>

  <p>It was not only Luo Zheng who thought it abnormal.</p>

  <p>The races who explored the northern peak, the western peak, and the southern peak had also encountered the same problem.</p>

  <p>It was known that once they entered all the four peaks, they should have gained many Chaotic Source Spirits. But not even a single one was to be found.</p>

  <p>After all of them climbed to the top of the mountain from the cave, their eyes fell on the main peak in the very center, which was as sharp as a sword.</p>

  <p>"The only possibility is that all the Chaotic Source Spirits are gathered in the main peak," Darth said to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The latter examined the structure and asked, "So we can only enter the main peak?"</p>

  <p>"In all these years, very few people have gone there. Now, all the Chaotic Source Spirits are hiding up there. I wonder what kind of monster they have transformed into after fusing with each other," Chaim figured.</p>

  <p>Although he seemed rather playful and carefree, Chaim was, by nature, a very cautious person.</p>

  <p>Every warrior had to reach the Chaotic Source Realm if they wanted to grow more powerful. But it was unwise to risk all their lives for it, and waiting another ten years wasn't a big deal, after all.</p>

  <p>"But we can't just retreat now." Hutton frowned.</p>

  <p>They had traveled long to get where they were, so how could they give up so easily?</p>

  <p>"I don't think the others will give up right away." Luo Zheng looked up to the black smog in the sky. "First, we have to avoid the hurricane. Then, we can take a look."</p>

  <p>It was no easy task for the races to reach the core area, so naturally, none of them were willing to leave just yet. No matter how dangerous the main peak was, they were eager to see what lay there.</p>

  <p>But the outside of the Chaotic Source World was already in an uproar.</p>

  <p>All the core disciples and talents of the super forces had been guaranteed absolute safety. Almost all of them were equipped with powerful Latent Theurgies, but many of the excellent warriors had died in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>"Who killed our crown prince?" The Celestial Wolf race's leader grimaced with red eyes.</p>

  <p>"Our young master is a rare talent. How could he die?"</p>

  <p>"It's impossible..."</p>

  <p>Many of the members from various races had died in the Chaotic Source World, each of them being extraordinary warriors. It wasn't a normal occurrence.</p>

  <p>By rights, it should have been likely for them to reach the Chaotic Source Realm...</p>

  <p>The Celestial Wolf race's leader's head suddenly shot up as he roared to the sky. "The Li Shan mountain owes us an explanation!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! What on earth is going on with the hurricane in the Chaotic Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Back then, we built the Chaotic Source World in order to compete with each other. If we knew a huge group of warriors would die, we should all just distribute the entirety of the Chaotic Source Spirits, shouldn't we?"</p>

  <p>This Chaotic Source Spirits could be controlled. Because of the unequal distribution of these Chaotic Source Spirits, the Chaotic Source World was built. On the one hand, the members of the races could receive training, while on the other hand, they could obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits with their own strength.</p>

  <p>But this time, too many warriors had died all at once. Their deaths far exceeded the leaders' expectations and they couldn't bear it.</p>

  <p>Squeak! "Those warriors were killed by the young man in black who got off the Black Ship," the leader of the Ear Mouse race spoke up.</p>

  <p>Apart from the Li Shan mountain, only the Ear Mouse race knew the Chaotic Source World as clearly. They always had their own special channels of obtaining information.</p>

  <p>"Black Ship..."</p>

  <p>"Is Shera still in the Icy Snow Province?"</p>

  <p>"I will look for her and try to negotiate."</p>

  <p>"Since our members have perished, what's the use of negotiating? When that brat comes out, I'll tear him to pieces!" The leader of the Separate Abyss race uttered curses with his eyes wide open in rage. He wanted to crush the Evil God to dust.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a voice resounded.</p>

  <p>"The more people that perish, the more benefits the survivors gain. You can only hope that the rest of your races can survive and even reach the Chaotic Source Realm." Fuxi's figure appeared once again in the middle of the open space.</p>

  <p>"Human Sovereign, what do you mean?" the old man of the Bearing race asked.</p>

  <p>Adonis' death pained them. While the members of the Ear Mouse race knew that he had fallen to death by Luo Zheng's hands, they wanted to side with Luo Zheng and put all the blame on the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"You can ask Xuanyuan about it when you go back," Fuxi replied plainly. "It should be the last time the Chaotic Source World opens."</p>

  <p>The various alliances in the Source World were growing increasingly clear in the chaotic condition.</p>

  <p>Even the civilizations on the Other Shore were itching for some action.</p>

  <p>After the Chaos Ancient Gods had brewed for billions of years, they understood their positions.</p>

  <p>The spokespersons had already been well prepared for the fierce battle to come.</p>
