  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was evident that No. 9527 didn't really favor the merging of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was clueless about the origin of No. 9527, nor did he realize the importance of the Divine Dao Great Unity.</p>

  <p>However, he was excited to show Luo Zheng his capabilities.</p>

  <p>"Should I demonstrate the merging again?" the Evil God asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and said, "No, that won't be necessary. I am aware that you have merged the Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not only omniscient, but also omnipotent in his inner world. If he wanted to, he could know everything.</p>

  <p>"Then allow me to take my leave. I hope you will be able to fulfill your promise as soon as possible." The Evil God cupped his hands toward Luo Zheng and in a flash disappeared from the floating island.</p>

  <p>After he had left, No. 9527 asked, "What kind of promise did you make to him?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged casually and replied, "He wants to leave my inner world."</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was appalled, as it asked, "Are you going to allow that to happen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What's wrong in letting him go?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 said with a small smile, "You know I don't think highly of the Divine Dao Great Unity. But he merged 2, 994 Divine Dao in just ten years, which suggests that he is exceptionally talented. It's hard to estimate his achievements in the future. It will be a pity to let him go."</p>

  <p>"Should I place a slave seal on him?" Luo Zheng disdained to use this method.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was born in his inner world, but he never bestowed upon him any kind of special support. Despite that, with his outstanding abilities, the Evil God was able to obtain his current cultivation base and achievements.</p>

  <p>So if he wanted to leave, Luo Zheng would not be the one to stop him.</p>

  <p>"No matter how powerful the slave seal is, there is still a way to break it."</p>

  <p>No. 9527 shook its head as it continued, "As far as I know, many powerful masters in the Source World have such talents in their inner worlds. In fact, it's very easy to keep them."</p>

  <p>No matter how large the Source World was, there was a limited number of creatures.</p>

  <p>However, there was a separate world in the body of every powerful warrior who reached the Soul Sea Realm. These inner worlds held different types and numbers of creatures. But the total number was many times greater than that of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Hence, among such a massive amount of creatures, there were chances that one or two miraculous talents would appear.</p>

  <p>In No. 9527's eyes, the Evil God was one of them.</p>

  <p>"How?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You have witnessed it yourself. Your father is one such example," No. 9527 answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was initially stunned. But his expression cleared as he immediately understood. "Make him a Holy Being? The Rebirth Land?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 nodded. "This is a very common method. Through the Rebirth Land, his strength will be improved, but his fate will be bound with your inner world. There is a saying, you win some, you lose some."</p>

  <p>One of the advantages of the Rebirth Land was that it could ensure the Evil God's immortality. At the same time, he would be more powerful than the others. On the other hand, the disadvantage was equally obvious. It was equivalent to placing his own inner world in Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Therefore, most of the people in the Source World, such as the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm like Emily and Clement, avoided creating the Rebirth Land. If they had a Rebirth Land, they would be reborn in it, even if they died outside.</p>

  <p>There had been no news on Gu Bei so far. Everyone assumed that he must be living in a place of the chaos. Even if he died, he would come back to life in the Rebirth Land, namely his universe.</p>

  <p>"But how should I arrange the Rebirth Land? I am not aware of its procedure." Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 shrugged its shoulders. "It shouldn't be difficult for you. You can ask Emily. She will be knowing the process."</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really gave the Evil God a Rebirth Land, it would mean that he would have to give part of his inner world to the Evil God, which in turn would help the Evil God progress faster and reach the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>After becoming a consummate True God, the Evil God could cultivate the Truth of Divine Dao. Luo Zheng was looking forward to seeing how fast he could comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>After No. 9527 left, Luo Zheng set about arranging the time enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The time within his inner world and that of outside were at two different dimensions. Because of this, Yudie and the rest felt that time passed too slowly. One year outside was equivalent to more than ten years in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unable to change the time flow rate in his inner world. But it wasn't difficult to synchronize the time flow rate on the floating island with that of the outside.</p>

  <p>After tending to that issue, Luo Zheng spent several days with the women on the floating island before he dispersed his avatar.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng opened his eyes, he realized that the Trumpet Flying Ship had left the space channel and entered the chaos again.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the chaos clouds in the distance started to form some huge, strange patterns. In this boundless area, apart from the chaotic energy, there was no other living beings or substances present around.</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship was left alone.</p>

  <p>"Why did the ship leave the space channel?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Even though the speed of the Trumpet Flying Ship was remarkably fast, it would still take thousands, even ten thousand years, to arrive at the Source World, if it did not fly in the space channel.</p>

  <p>"The Trumpet Flying Ship won't be able to travel in the space channel continuously for a long time. It will have to leave every once in a while. It'll be fine after the space channel is rebuilt," Leopold replied with a smile, as he held the jade plate in his hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. He wanted to ask Emily about the Rebirth Land, but when he saw that she and the others had already entered a meditative state, he realized it was not the right time.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't be able to reach the Source World now, so he had plenty of chances in the future.</p>

  <p>After observing the ship for a while, Luo Zheng returned to his seat. This time, he intended to enter the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Leopold gently lifted the jade plate. The forces of Space Law spread out from the surface of the Trumpet Flying Ship. The ship was about to travel back to the space channel.</p>

  <p>The moment it entered the space channel, it started to vibrate violently.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>Emily and the others who had been cultivating quietly, opened their eyes.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Emily asked.</p>

  <p>Leopold shook his head and said with a trace of panic on his face, "I cannot figure out. The Trumpet Flying Ship seems to be out of control now."</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship that was flying smoothly a while ago was now constantly shaking. Even though Leopold tried his best to activate the divine crystals on the plate, he was still unable to maintain the stability of the ship.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood up and looked into the distance. He pointed at something far away and shouted, "Look! What's that?"</p>

  <p>In the chaotic space channel, there were intricate blue lines. They were hardly of any importance but just the traces left by the disorderly Space Law.</p>

  <p>However, they were all gathering deep into the space, towards a pitch black hole.</p>

  <p>All the lines stopped in front of the hole, as if they were all sucked in by it.</p>

  <p>    </p>
