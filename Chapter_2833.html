<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2833 Entering The Eight Diagrams </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Tianming was a little puzzled when he saw Zheng summon the girl with red eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng asked the red-eyed girl, "Can you establish a connection with the blue-eyed girl?"</p>

  <p>"With whom? What connection?" asked the red-eyed girl innocently with a smile.</p>

  <p>She had the intellect of a four-or five-year-old.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew how the girl's brain worked, but he didn't know how to explain things to her. So all he did was command Tianming, "Summon the blue-eyed girl!"</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded. A blue light appeared and with that the girl left his body.</p>

  <p>"A connection between you and her," Zheng said, pointing at the new entrant to help the red-eyed girl understand what he was saying.</p>

  <p>The girl with red eyes blinked and looked her blue-eyed counterpart.</p>

  <p>The two girls looked identical, except their temperament and the color of their pupils.</p>

  <p>"Connection..."</p>

  <p>The red-eyed girl frowned trying to think hard, and then she said, "Do you mean this?"</p>

  <p>As she spoke, a blue light flashed between her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Space was being emitted faintly through the light. Then the light turned into a thin thread, spreading to the blue-eyed girl. It was a blue thread!</p>

  <p>It was a special spatial passageway, which could only be used to transmit energy between the two girls. It was their instinct and innate ability.</p>

  <p>As soon as the blue-eyed girl saw the thin thread, her previously indifferent demeanor changed. She showed a trace of interest, and the middle of her eyebrows also emitted a ray of light. The two thin threads intertwined in the void.</p>

  <p>When the thin threads met, Tianming and Zheng also had a strange feeling, as if a layer of perception occurred in their minds, which allowed them to become aware of each other's existence.</p>

  <p>"It's done!" Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>By now, the woman and Sword Chen knew Zheng's purpose. Once the two girls got connected, they were seemingly invincible. Earlier, she had created clones of the Holy Beings, but even when united, the clones could not hurt the girls.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the Eight Diagrams above and said, "Tianming, let's go up together!"</p>

  <p>Warriors as powerful as Emily might be able to break the Eight Diagrams in the air using brute force. Some Other Shore Realm warriors, who were less powerful but proficient in breaking arrays, could probably break it too.</p>

  <p>After all, the furnace that Nicholas displayed might not be perfect.</p>

  <p>But right now, none of the warriors present knew how to break the array.</p>

  <p>Zheng also was unsure about it, so he followed his instinct and made a decision!</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Tianming replied confidently without any hesitation. He trusted Zheng's judgment completely.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there was no other choice but to take a risk.</p>

  <p>Something peculiar started to happen to Nicholas' body as he stood still in the center of the huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>His arms, nails and hair turned into red crystals, and his entire body was covered with cracks.</p>

  <p>The fragments of the cracked skin were also turning into crystals.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>One Demi-holy Being couldn't stand it anymore and flew into Nicholas. He, too, was crushed into pieces before getting absorbed into Nicholas' body.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was refining everything that was close to him and, at the same time, he was glaring at Zheng and Tianming who were standing far away.</p>

  <p>When he saw that the two girls were once again connected, his face suddenly darkened.</p>

  <p>He knew how powerful the two girls could be when they combined forces.</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult to break the Furnace of Dark and Light, but it was not impossible!</p>

  <p>With this thought in his mind, Nicholas started waving his shapeless hands.</p>

  <p>Countless red crystals fluttered along with his movements, and the Eight Diagrams above started to spin.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams shrank once more!</p>

  <p>But the momentum and pressure inside the Eight Diagrams had the opposite effect— they were again increasing greatly!</p>

  <p>"Argh!"</p>

  <p>"I can't take it anymore! Please just let me die!"</p>

  <p>Some of the Demi-holy Beings had lost their minds and were screaming in agony and flying around in the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>It was a small area of less than two miles. There was no space for them to flee. One of the Demi-holy Beings dashed towards the woman.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was the first to react. The brown sword rays formed a large net and enveloped the Demi-holy Being inside and cut him up into pieces.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Demi-holy Beings were all sucked into Nicholas' body. Their bodies, weapons, and their fancy clothes were all shredded apart and turned into crystals.</p>

  <p>After the ten-odd Demi-holy Beings had been obliterated, only a few Holy Beings remained along with Samuel and Sword Chen and his group.</p>

  <p>Even these handful survivors were struggling to make it.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Samuel had activated some kind of a secret skill. His eyes were bleeding and his hair had gone from black to white.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was in a complete state of emotion closing. While there was no emotion in his eyes, his body was trembling violently.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Tianming stood beneath the Eight Diagrams and looked at the rapidly rotating Eight Diagrams, trying to gain confidence for what they were about to do.</p>

  <p>No matter how many people attacked it, the Eight Diagrams couldn't be broken easily.</p>

  <p>"Let's go in!" Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>Now there was no time to hesitate or ponder over his fatal command.</p>

  <p>If they didn't break the array, they would all die; and if they could destroy it, they would live.</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded and the two of them entered the array boldly but cautiously.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams array was full of Dark and Light energies inside.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered, Zheng felt a magnetic force, which could tear him to pieces!</p>

  <p>Luckily, since his body had just been refined by the red lotuses, it was infused with the Truth of Godly Way. After taking a portion of the power into his own body, he was able to barely hold on.</p>

  <p>He was more worried about Tianming. After all, his body wasn't as strong as his.</p>

  <p>He couldn't see how Tianming was dealing with the Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>Zheng was worrying about him when suddenly he felt a powerful surge of energy in his body. It gave him a start.</p>

  <p>Almost instinctively, Zheng decided to release this energy!</p>

  <p>Hundreds of red lotuses surrounded his body, crazily extending outwards.</p>

  <p>Tianming was in the same situation as Zheng.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming killing power in his body was transmitted to Zheng, and as Zheng transferred the surging power in his body to Tianming, thousands of ice flowers exploded everywhere!</p>

  <p>"Is it done?"</p>

  <p>The woman raised her head and looked up. She could see that in the spinning Eight Diagrams array, a ray of red light and a ray of blue light were rapidly rotating. These two lights must be Zheng and Tianming!</p>

  <p>Nicholas was also observing the two lights in the Eight Diagrams. He could clearly sense the existence of both Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Just like two stubborn stones in a torrent, Zheng and Tianming helped each other to stop the circulation of Dark and Light energies, hoping to break the form of the Furnace of Dark and Light using pure brute force!</p>
