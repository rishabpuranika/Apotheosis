  <p>
</p>

  <p>Bergen injected everything that he had into his sword attack.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had nowhere to escape, his only option was to deflect the attack as much as he could. His survival was not guaranteed at all.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng tried his best to deal with the attacks from Arvin and his sister Bonnie at the same time.</p>

  <p>Although he seemed calm, he was under a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Bergen was approaching with a heavy sword, Zheng swung his long sword up and down as fast as he could. After he cut countless butterflies and flying knives, he began to swing the long sword sideways.</p>

  <p>The tip of his sword went straight towards Bergen's heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng's swordsmanship was still ingenious but the enemy he was facing then was not just any other warrior from the Lower World of the universe.</p>

  <p>Bergen ignored Zheng's sword and went straight for his body.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng's long sword touched the heavy sword, he immediately felt a huge crushing force. He reached out his hand but couldn't hold it any longer. His long sword unexpectedly flew out of his hand and stuck on the ground not far away.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng no longer had his weapon, Bergen no longer hesitated and immediately raised his heavy sword up high to prepare for a strike.</p>

  <p>At that moment, on the other side of the roof was Emily rushing over as fast as she could.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Azure blue whip shadows constantly exploded behind Emily.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was being driven into a dead end, she gritted her teeth and bypassed the man in black who tried to stop her. She wanted to help Zheng as much as she could.</p>

  <p>Emily was like a swift swallow. She jumped in the air as her extremely soft body tightened like a bow. As her body stretched further, the saber in her hand shot towards Bergen.</p>

  <p>At the same time on the back side of the street, Timotheus ran wildly with his saber on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>According to their previous agreement, Timotheus' main responsibilities were to protect Zelda and Luther. So once the battle with the Warden race began, he immediately escorted the two to safety.</p>

  <p>Just like Emily, Timotheus couldn't bear to see Zheng die in that place.</p>

  <p>He rushed over and threw out the saber in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The broad saber flew over the heads of the people who were in the middle of a fight before it headed straight for Bergen.</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>Bergen's eyes blinked as a subtle grin appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p>

  <p>He raised his hand as he gently waved it backwards.</p>

  <p>The annular saber that Emily threw at him was broken into two parts in a flash.</p>

  <p>After he cut off the annular saber, his heavy sword took the chance and was able to hit the huge saber that Timotheus threw hard at him.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The saber was cut in half as it fell down.</p>

  <p>Such ordinary weapons weren't strong enough to resist the energy attached to his heavy sword at all. It was all thanks to the grace given by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>"You are defeating nothing but the air!"</p>

  <p>After saying this, Bergen turned around to face Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>He felt like an executioner who could take Zheng's life away if he wanted to. He knew the exiles couldn't do anything to stop him at all.</p>

  <p>But then again, it was Timotheus of the Nine Li race and Emily of the Snake Goddess race that just tried to rescue Zheng from him.</p>

  <p>They were probably the two most powerful exiles in this world. Since they were so worried about Zheng's safety, he must really be of great importance.</p>

  <p>"Now, you will die. No one can save you anymore," Bergen said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>On the surface of the heavy sword in his hand were rings of blue light. It seemed that he turned the heavy sword into a long spear and then threw it directly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>If anyone got stabbed by his spear, they were sure to die within seconds.</p>

  <p>Their bodies would be crushed into tiny pieces by its energy.</p>

  <p>"If you don't make a move right now, you won't stand a chance," reminded No. 9527 on the sclerite at Zheng's chest. It couldn't stand it anymore.</p>

  <p>After Zheng condensed the Truth Crystal with the help of No. 9527, he was able to master the most rudimentary move of the Truth Crystal, which was known as the Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>To be more precise, the Falling Star Palm was not really its most rudimentary move.</p>

  <p>To directly melt the Truth Crystal and infuse it into his arm and sword like what Zheng did before was the most basic way.</p>

  <p>Therefore, No. 9527 felt somewhat dissatisfied, wondering why Zheng did that.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had his own considerations.</p>

  <p>He had no idea how powerful the Warden race was. If he could deal with them with the power of the Truth Crystal alone, he wouldn't want to use his trump cards in order to postpone the revelation of his Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the energy of the Truth Crystal and his martial arts skills were enough all the time.</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng knew that he had no other choice. He couldn't hold back anymore.</p>

  <p>He raised his head as a square Truth Crystal appeared. It emitted a dark green light in his palm.</p>

  <p>As he concentrated his mind, the Truth Crystal began to rotate slowly.</p>

  <p>"The Falling Star Palm!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>In an instant, the Truth Crystal began to rotate rapidly.</p>

  <p>At the same time, an identical vortex also appeared above everyone's heads. However, the vortex was ten times larger and an emerald green light could be seen on it.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The light in the vortex shone brighter and with a gentle stroke of Zheng's hand, it began to fall down.</p>

  <p>Since the Warden race received the grace of Herbert, they used it superficially.</p>

  <p>Just like what Zheng had done before, they had merely turned this energy into a weapon.</p>

  <p>It was the original intention of Herbert all along because the azure blue light summoned by the Warden race couldn't be transformed into any other shape.</p>

  <p>Sandy's two sharp blades, Arvin's Trapping Butterflies, and Bonnie's flying knives were some of the best examples.</p>

  <p>Perhaps in Herbert's opinion, the Warden race stood a chance against invaders because of their master's grace.</p>

  <p>The only person who was capable of changing the shape of the blue energy was Bergen with his heavy sword.</p>

  <p>However, the number of changes he could do was also limited. Only to a certain extent could he control the energy. He couldn't control it at will or activate and use it in a theurgy.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had displayed a theurgy.</p>

  <p>In order to master the Falling Star Palm, Zheng had to spend a lot of time studying it.</p>

  <p>However, the final power that it produced was a bit of a disappointment to him.</p>

  <p>According to what No. 9527 had said, if its master revealed the Falling Star Palm, thousands of stars would fall. Every star would be so powerful that it could destroy the world within minutes.</p>

  <p>However, it was currently impossible for Zheng to accumulate so many Truth Crystals and use the technique.</p>

  <p>A small ray of light wouldn't be enough to kill an ordinary Wild God so it was not ideal at all. That was why Zheng chose not to show it to anyone yet.</p>

  <p>However, after the Strength Equalizing Theurgy had been used, they all became mortals. The Falling Star Palm was the only theurgy he could actually show.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the power of what was once proved useless suddenly became extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>The shining star immediately lit up everyone's face.</p>
