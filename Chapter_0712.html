</p>

  <p>The woman next to Yan also looked like a puppet— her eyes were closed, and her face was expressionless.</p>

  <p>'What on earth did Eddie do to Yan? How did she become like this?'</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to check his emotions.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, Eddie was the strongest warrior in the Central Region. Zheng wasn't his match as yet. If Zheng let his impulses take hold of him, even Yudie wouldn't be able to protect him.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Six Senses Blocking Method?" The cyan dragon said. Although he was the weakest among the nine Genuine Dragons in terms of strength, the cyan dragon was the most knowledgeable.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Zheng asked, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon explained as he watched Yan and the woman beside her,</p>

  <p>"It's a cultivation method, by which, the cultivators' six senses are blocked, so that they can't see, hear, smell, feel, or taste. The cultivators also lose their sense of space. Thus, they're unable to communicate with the outside world. The Six Senses Blocking Method is supposed to be used by the cultivators when they cultivate. It's a pity that someone like Eddie has mastered it."</p>

  <p>Obviously, the cyan dragon knew the history of the Six Senses Blocking Method. There were some secrets Zheng didn't know. But he was too worried about Yan to care about anything else. "Is it harmful to the cultivator?"</p>

  <p>"Not really. It can improve the cultivator's cultivation base significantly in a short time. Hasn't Eddie been trying to arrange the Lustful Demon Array?" the cyan dragon reminded Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I know what he did. He improved Yan's cultivation base using the Six Senses Blocking Method so that she could enter the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>But wait..." Zheng seemed to have remembered something. With raised eyebrows, he said, "Both Marilyn and Yan have a Purple Power Body, so that means..."</p>

  <p>He shifted his eyes to the woman next to Yan. Apparently, her senses had also been blocked.</p>

  <p>"You're right. She also has a Purple Power Body. Eddie has already found the three people he needs. Once your sister and that woman enter the Internal Elixir Realm, the Lustful Demon Array will be realized," the cyan dragon said calmly.</p>

  <p>"It's strange, though. The Central Region is a small place. Isn't it a coincidence that such a small place has three people with a Purple Power Body? You know, Purple Power Bodies are very adaptable. These people are excellent body refiners," the red dragon cut in, giggling.</p>

  <p>Zheng was too anxious to pay any attention to him.</p>

  <p>Kenneth had said that Purple Power Bodies were rare. There might be one in a trillion. Therefore, it should have been extremely difficult to gather three people with a Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>Zheng had thought that Eddie had only found Marilyn and Yan and that it would take him a while to locate the third person he needed. Unexpectedly, he had found all three.</p>

  <p>Now, to realize his Lustful Demon Array, all Eddie needed to do was make Yan, and the woman he had recently found enter the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng was running out of time.</p>

  <p>"Marilyn..." Zheng muttered as he glared at the woman behind Eddie. His fists were clenched so tight that the veins within his fists throbbed.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was determined to kill Marilyn, he knew that it would be hard to accomplish his mission in the arena.</p>

  <p>The attendees of the Martial Arts Contest were the best cultivators of the Central Region. In time, they would enter the Virtual Tribulation Realm and become the most influential people in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>They were no ordinary cultivators.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Patrick, for example, were both strong. Given time, they would become even more competent. Likewise, major sects like Ethereal Spirit Sect and Bloodwood Cliff had disciples as brilliant as Tianming and Patrick, and all of them were in the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Knowing how important this Martial Arts Contest was to him, Zheng had come prepared.</p>

  <p>But, even so, the gravity of the situation was still beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>The tiniest slip could mean failure.</p>

  <p>The cultivators were still enthusiastically talking to each other. Only, now they were focusing on Eddie. As the strongest cultivator in the Central Region, he had drawn even more attention than Lady Poison-blood and Yudie.</p>

  <p>Zheng was in no mood to listen to what they were saying.</p>

  <p>Just then, three rays of light appeared, soared into the sky, and cracked the clouds. All eyes were drawn to them.</p>

  <p>In the three rays of light, three chairs were lifted and finally stopped. In the blink of an eye, the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance were seen in the chairs.</p>

  <p>The expressions on the three men's plump faces varied. They were different from the day Zheng had returned from the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>As the backbones of the World Commercial Alliance, the three leaders' cultivation bases were unfathomable. Strong as Eddie was, he would be no match for them if they united. Besides these three, at the World Commercial Alliance, there was also an old man who was over 1, 700 years old.</p>

  <p>Since people hadn't seen him for a long time, he was a mystery. Till now, all sects, big and small, only knew of his existence, but none knew who he was.</p>

  <p>Humans who had lived for a thousand years or more were monsters. They were often referred to as Ancient Tycoons.</p>

  <p>Even the Elderly Luna wouldn't be able to get that title until twenty-odd years later. But the man who was over 1, 700 years old at the World Commercial Alliance was absolutely an Ancient Tycoon.</p>

  <p>This was how strong the World Commercial Alliance was. Even the fifth-tier sect Ethereal Spirit Sect couldn't compare.</p>

  <p>"It's such an honor to have so many sects and cultivators present today for the Martial Arts Contest in the Oracle City. The World Commercial Alliance appreciates it. So, a gift has been prepared for every cultivator present," Dillon said slowly.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished, hundreds of cultivators were chased onto a platform on one side of the arena by a group of cultivators from the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>They were either at the nature level or the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>However, they all wore handcuffs and shackles. Despair was written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>"These cultivators are our prisoners. They are guilty of all kinds of evil and are on death row. They're supposed to be executed by dismemberment. But today, the World Commercial Alliance will give their human life years to the cultivators present as a gift." With that, Dillon leaped up, and a huge drum appeared above those cuffed cultivators' heads.</p>

  <p>"It's the World Commercial Alliance's Drum of Vitality between Heaven and Earth," someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I live in Oracle City and hear the sound of the drum occasionally, but this is the first time that I have seen it," a second person announced.</p>

  <p>"Their human life years? What does that mean?" someone else in the crowd muttered.</p>

  <p>While people were discussing, Dillon stood on the drum and lifted the 20-foot-long drumstick.</p>

  <p>The stick weighed 50, 000 pounds, but he raised it as easily as if he were holding a thin twig, leaving a trail of an arc.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The stick struck the drum hard and made a dull sound.</p>

  <p>As soon as the stick hit the surface of the drum, an invisible wave emerged and encircled the cultivators under the drum, creating a vortex.</p>

  <p>Quickly, the cultivators' bodies shrank. The drum was sucking their blood and energy!</p>

  <p>After that, above the drum, a ray of golden light started spreading in all directions.</p>

  <p>Closest to the drum were people from Cloud Hall, Ethereal Spirit Sect, and other major sects. They sucked most of the golden light before it reached the other cultivators.</p>

  <p>Next, it was the cultivators who had passed the pre-qualifying test, including Zheng and Owen.</p>

  <p>"The golden light can increase our human life years?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>When the light reached Zheng, he absorbed a lot and felt immediately refreshed and vigorous.</p>

  <p>Since there were too many cultivators, the light was thin when it reached the spectators' stand.</p>

  <p>However, no one was willing to miss this valuable opportunity. The hundreds of thousands of spectators all sniffed greedily. The light was soon exhausted. The amount every spectator got was merely a hundred millionth of what Zheng had absorbed.</p>

  <p>When the golden light ran out, everyone turned their attention back to the drum. The prisoners on death row still stood as they had been a moment ago. The only difference was that their bodies had shriveled and their skins were ghostly white. They were no more than zombies.</p>
