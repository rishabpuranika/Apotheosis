<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Beldene's right. No matter what, it's better than standing by and waiting," said Ingram, smiling.</p>

  <p>Knowing there was little hope, he and Laura didn't expect too much.</p>

  <p>When the time limit for the Latent Theurgy came, they would probably have to put up a desperate fight.</p>

  <p>Sitting upright, Beldene activated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Then he entered the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Although Elgin said that it was impossible to get any help, he followed Beldene to the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Sitting up straight, Zheng began to activate the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>But he was shocked with the turn of events.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard he recited in his heart, he couldn't condense any Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>'Is it because of the Imperial Sword Seal?' Zheng guessed, thinking hard.</p>

  <p>His Soaring Snake Sword had released sword threads with terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful warriors like Laura and Ingram might not be able to resist its power, let alone the warrior of the Black Armor race who just reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng thought he could activate the Soaring Snake Sword's power at no cost, but now, he realized that he was wrong.</p>

  <p>He wondered if he would not be able to make use of this Truth of Godly Way, or if it would take him some time to recover.</p>

  <p>But now was not the time to worry about it. Fortunately, Zheng was able to master more than one Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>For a moment, he stayed in deep thought, as traces of natural aura began to emit from his body. Now, he could only use the Truth of Cultivation Nature to return to the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in front of the main gate of a palace, the drunk Evaristus was thrown on the steps made of cyan bricks.</p>

  <p>Being taken back forcibly while he was drinking, he ended into a drunk rage.</p>

  <p>Despite being powerful, the palace guards all lowered their heads and looked at their young master expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>Evaristus stayed there for a while.</p>

  <p>After some time, Felicity, Daisy and Dorothy walked down the steps slowly.</p>

  <p>Seeing her son like this, Daisy slightly frowned before she gently walked up to where he was. Lightly waving her hand against his forehead, she wiped away his hangover.</p>

  <p>Although Evaristus had regained his consciousness, he still had a trace of unhappiness on his face. Seeing his mother, he said coldly, "Mother, why did you call me over?"</p>

  <p>Daisy replied, smiling, "We found a method..."</p>

  <p>But before she could finish talking, Evaristus interrupted, "Did you really find a way? You told me that more than a hundred times. I know you take great pains to help me all the time, but you've disappointed me every time.</p>

  <p>How cruel!"</p>

  <p>Evaristus was not an unreasonable person. However, his mother disappointed him again and again after he fell into despair. In this case, he became stubborn and non-cooperative.</p>

  <p>"This time..." Daisy started again.</p>

  <p>However, Evaristus didn't seem interested. Turning around, he was ready to leave.</p>

  <p>With a frown, Dorothy immediately blocked his way. She tried to pull up a smile and said, "Evaristus, can you please listen to Aunt Daisy for a second?"</p>

  <p>"No!" Evaristus uttered firmly.</p>

  <p>"Then can you let me talk instead?" Dorothy asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to listen to you!" Evaristus responded, avoiding her eyes.</p>

  <p>Despite saying so, he just stood still. Seeing the creepy smile on Dorothy's face, he felt something was different this time around.</p>

  <p>"I've been trapped in the huge whirlpool too," Dorothy started.</p>

  <p>"What?" Evaristus was stunned, and his eyes widened as he looked at Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"And someone broke the huge whirlpool." Dorothy shrugged and added, "It is true. If you don't believe it, you can leave now."</p>

  <p>But those words were enough to change his mind. Evaristus no longer wanted to leave.</p>

  <p>Patiently, he listened while Dorothy narrated the matter about the whirlpool of the Sea of Truth. After Dorothy was done speaking, she realized a change in his expression. He seemed lightning-struck. After a while, he finally came back to his senses and said, "Dorothy, don't you dare play your tricks on me!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy shook her head. "Of course not. I would never fool you."</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?" Evaristus asked cautiously, fearing Dorothy would suddenly take back what she just said.</p>

  <p>Feeling the small sword between her eyebrows move slightly, Dorothy answered, "He has just entered the Sea of Truth. I will follow him!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy felt that Zheng just entered the sea. Once he moved farther, it would be difficult for her to find him.</p>

  <p>After finding a place, Dorothy quickly began to activate the Truth of Godly Way. Then, she allowed her Soul of Light to enter the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>When her Truth Boat came into being, Zheng came to her view. He was adjusting the boat's direction, letting it drift back and forth.</p>

  <p>Her heart jumped a little with the thought of Zheng awaiting her arrival.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, can you do me a favor?" Dorothy asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned at her before he responded, "What a coincidence! I also want you to help me, and it's very urgent."</p>

  <p>His answer piqued her curiosity. With a puzzled expression, she quickly asked, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Have you heard of the Sword Light Palace?" Zheng asked, staring at her.</p>

  <p>Blinking her eyes, she shook her head. Although she was knowledgeable and talented, a small force like the Sword Light Palace was numerous in the human race. Thus naturally she had never heard of it.</p>

  <p>"It's located in the Seven-Star Province, very close to the Wild Goose Pass,"</p>

  <p>Zheng added.</p>

  <p>"I know the Wild Goose Pass. What about it?" Confused, Dorothy still couldn't follow.</p>

  <p>"This Sword Light Palace was created by Athemar Qiu and it is a subordinate force belonging to the Oneness Sky Palace. However, due to the attacks made by some nonhuman monsters of the Other Shore Realm,</p>

  <p>I'm trapped three thousand miles north of the Sword Light Palace. My safety could only last for five days. After that, I'm afraid I will be in great trouble," Zheng said concisely.</p>

  <p>"You have entered the Source World!" Dorothy exclaimed. "And you are trapped in the Seven-Star Province. Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Saying it out loud, Dorothy immediately became anxious.</p>

  <p>Zheng just flashed his usual smile. Then he asked calmly, "Dora, you just said that you wanted me to help you too. What can I help you with?"</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about it later. I... I'll leave the Sea of Truth right now. Wait for me," Dorothy said to him quickly.</p>

  <p>She remembered that the Wild Goose Pass was located at the edge of the Source World, marking the entrance to chaos. It was not too close to the Oneness Sky Palace. Five days was too short, and she didn't want to waste any time.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng realized what just happened, Dorothy's Truth Boat already disappeared.</p>

  <p>It took her less than five minutes to enter and leave the Sea of Truth, so naturally Dorothy met Daisy's, Felicity's and Evaristus' curious stares when she got back.</p>

  <p>"Zheng seems to be in trouble," Dorothy explained. "He is being besieged by some nonhuman monsters of the Other Shore Realm in the Seven-Star Province. He can only hold on for five more days."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Daisy and Felicity felt a bit shocked.</p>

  <p>They knew that the only person who could save Evaristus was Zheng.</p>

  <p>If what Dorothy said was true and Zheng happened to die this time, then Evaristus would also be doomed.</p>

  <p>"The Wild Goose Pass is next to the Seven-Star Province. Five days is too long. I will ask my husband to take action."</p>

  <p>Being a decisive person, Daisy immediately made up her mind.</p>

  <p>In an attempt to save her son, she had gone through several disappointments. Even if Zheng was really a liar, she would never give up trying.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, she turned into a streak of light and flew away.</p>
