<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 688 What Just Happened Here </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng leaped to his feet and stood at the top of the pagoda. From where he was standing, he could see the horizons unfold before him. It was a breathtaking view to see.</p>

  <p>However, when he turned his eyes to the end of the grassland, he saw something strange. As he looked carefully, he realized that it was a group of ogres running violently towards him. The ogres were wearing silver armor with one shoulder exposed. Each ogre was holding a spear in each hand.</p>

  <p>They marched towards Luo Luo Zheng in formation.</p>

  <p>"They plan to use spears to launch long attacks!" Luo Luo Zheng was rather impressed than worried. He raised his brows, and then rushed towards his enemy without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>The ogres ran surprisingly fast. If these ogres got any nearer to Luo Zheng's pagoda, they could just throw their spears simultaneously and destroy the pagoda. So, Luo Luo Zheng was left with no choice but to launch an attack and kill them all before they could get any nearer.</p>

  <p>"Zap?"</p>

  <p>The two bowmen on the pagoda covered Luo Luo Zheng and killed two ogres with their arrows.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng rushed to the ogres and was about to launch an attack, but something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>The ogres roared at that time.</p>

  <p>"Brouhaha!"</p>

  <p>It was so loud that anyone within a mile radius could break their eardrums.</p>

  <p>After the roar, the ogres' eyes turned crimson red. Then, they raised their spears and started to attack Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What the heck? So, now they can attack on their own!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng initially thought that the ogres were only after his pagoda, but it turned out that they were also after him. He wasn't prepared but quickly dodged them. He flashed through the rain of spears, brandishing his Blood Drinking Sword to return the favor.</p>

  <p>The ogres were far stronger than the three-eyed spiders. They were also different in some ways. The three-eyed spiders only targeted Luo Zheng's pagoda and didn't launch a direct attack on him. The ogres, on the other hand, were actively attacking Luo Luo Zheng while running at top speed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the number of ogres was smaller than that of the three-eyed spiders.</p>

  <p>"Charge!"</p>

  <p>While he was avoiding the spears, he was swinging his sword at the ogres, cutting their throats. He could cut four ogres' throats with just one swing.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could have killed these ogres instantly, but he chose not to. He had a new insight about the minimalist way when he practiced in the Upper World. It was a set of basic swordsmanship which he thought could still be further simplified.</p>

  <p>Right now, Luo Luo Zheng still didn't know the limits of minimalist ways. So, he had no idea how far the set of basic swordsmanship could be further simplified and what further changes could be made.</p>

  <p>With his little understanding of the minimalist ways, he needed a lot of practice before he could make breakthroughs. So, he was forced to use the basic swordsmanship to kill these ogres although it was quite inefficient.</p>

  <p>While he was on it, he suddenly realized something about the minimalist ways.</p>

  <p>During the first stage of the pre-qualifying match, Luo Luo Zheng had no intention to exert so much effort. Given that this was only the second wave of attack, there was no need for him to fight hard.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't mind if he was taking too long to kill those ogres than any other practitioners. The ogres were scattered everywhere in the grassland. In the first stage, Luo Luo Zheng had it easy because nothing gave him a problem.</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had quite improved in handling ogres. When he first took the Blooded Test, he was chased all the way by an ogre and could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>But now, he could kill these well-equipped ogres one after the other like getting in the wheat. Soon enough, he was able to kill almost all the ogres.</p>

  <p>As soon as he killed all the ogres, he looked back with a surprised expression in his face. Unexpectedly, there were still two ogres left.</p>

  <p>The two ogres with red eyes rushed towards the pagoda as they waved the spears in their hands.</p>

  <p>They were fast and getting much closer to the pagoda.</p>

  <p>"Shit!"</p>

  <p>The pagoda could only endure twenty attacks before it collapsed. The two ogres had four spears and could attack at the same time, which meant that they could damage the pagoda four times in one shot.</p>

  <p>This was only the second wave of attack from the magic array, so if the pagoda was attacked four times now, Luo Luo Zheng might find it difficult to endure the next attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was starting to get worried when suddenly, two sharp arrows pierced through the hearts of the ogres and they fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"That was close!"</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Luo Zheng was somewhat careless. He was focused on perfecting his basic swordsmanship and had hoped to make new breakthroughs in a minimalist way. With that, he almost let the two ogres slip through the net.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the two ogres were shot dead by the two bowmen on his pagoda. It was thanks to the upgrade he did on his pagoda from the last round that the pagoda remained intact.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the palace, Michael, Xiao, and the middle-aged warrior just shook their heads when they witnessed Luo Zheng's performance. They were quite disappointed but glad to see Luo Luo Zheng holding up somehow.</p>

  <p>"In the second wave of attack, the ogres weren't that strong. As you can see, none of the 400 warriors were attacked. However, Luo Zheng's pagoda got almost attacked by the two ogres. Luckily, he managed to stop that with the help of his two bowmen. I have to say that this may affect his performance," said Michael emotionlessly.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged warrior echoed, "You're right. If he's having trouble dealing with the second wave, I am afraid he will not be able to handle the black turtles in the third wave. We all know that the defense of black turtles is well organized. If he can manage that, I bet the best he can make is the fourth wave."</p>

  <p>Xiao was a bit more confused. He then said, "I know he has learned the power of the Thunder Law, but why didn't he use it? Why did he keep using his sword?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could have killed the ogres at an extremely fast speed without even using a trick. But compared with others, he was still slower. Others could kill all the ogres with one swing, while Luo Luo Zheng chose to do it one by one.</p>

  <p>This confused Xiao. He knew Luo Luo Zheng could have defeated all these ogres faster than anyone else. But to his surprise, he didn't.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't have an idea that the elders were watching him from the Picture Slab. But even if he knew, he couldn't care less.</p>

  <p>Killing the ogres got Luo Luo Zheng 3, 000 points and he once again used it all to reinforce the pagoda immediately.</p>

  <p>In this magic array, one had a chance to be in the top three by grabbing other participants' points.</p>

  <p>The ten attacks on the first stage would eliminate most of the candidates.</p>

  <p>By the second stage, the pagodas would play a very crucial role in fighting with other candidates, destroying their pagodas and grabbing their points.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was necessary to reinforce the pagoda before the second stage.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng reinforced the pagoda for the second time. A red light flashed, and the pagoda was reinforced once again. Then, golden patterns appeared on the surface of the pagoda. Suddenly, the number of the bowmen became three, and their bows and arrows also changed.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the blackish green arrows, Luo Luo Zheng still felt threatened.</p>

  <p>"In no time, the pagoda will be formidable if I continue to reinforce it," Luo Luo Zheng said to himself as he gasped in admiration.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, other warriors were also reinforcing their own pagodas. This would make the second stage extremely difficult. By then, he would have to be cautious with dealing with other participants because their pagodas would probably be reinforced to the maximum.</p>

  <p>Soon, the third wave of attack in the magic array began. The black turtles started to appear from a distance. As Luo Luo Zheng saw them, he became cautious now. He couldn't be careless this time like he was with the ogres. Besides, these black turtles were different from the ogres. They had the ability to defend themselves, so Luo Luo Zheng could not use his basic swordsmanship on them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the palace, Michael was no longer interested in Luo Luo Zheng because of his previous performance. He immediately turned the Picture Slab to the most outstanding warrior he thought.</p>

  <p>"Owen is indeed strong. In the first two rounds of attacks, he came out in front. He just reached the peak of the Illuminating Soul Realm, but he already surpasses most of the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm," said Michael, as Owen's image was shown on the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>"That's right. He's undeniably strong and very likely to get a place. If he succeeds, he will be the only warrior at the peak of the Illuminating Soul Realm to enter the main draw match," Xiao nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think he can easily take care of those black turtles. The wind blade he condenses is very destructive. Black turtles won't be able to resist his attack," agreed the middle-aged warrior.</p>

  <p>They could see that Owen was killing the black turtles in quite a fast speed.</p>

  <p>The shells of these black turtles were tough and hard. They could be used to make great defensive armor. Excellent weapon refiners could even turn the black turtle armor into fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>The number of black turtles around Owen was starting to decrease. In a blink of an eye, almost half of black turtles were already killed. If he could keep this pace, Owen could get the first place in the third wave of attack.</p>

  <p>Michael's pride was about to burst, but when he accidentally glanced at the edge of the Picture Slab, he was stunned. He saw the progress of other participants and couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's name was on it. Michael saw something surprising.</p>

  <p>The Picture Slab showed that Luo Luo Zheng had successfully withstood the third wave of attack.</p>

  <p>"What just happened here?" Michael could hardly believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>Xiao and the middle-aged warrior eyed each other, wondering what Michael meant.</p>

  <p>Michael didn't say a word but just switched the Picture Slab to show Luo Zheng's images. When they looked at the Picture Slab, they didn't see anything special. But when they kept looking, they kept their emotions to themselves. They saw that Luo Luo Zheng had already killed all the black turtles around him!</p>

  <p>When the ogres almost got Luo Luo Zheng, they had given up all hopes for him. So, they switched to Owen and watched his progress. However, unexpectedly, Luo Luo Zheng had killed all the black turtles.</p>

  <p>Owen's speed of killing black turtles was still the fastest, but Luo Luo Zheng had finished. Surprisingly, Luo Luo Zheng was twice faster than Owen. They didn't expect this because of his previous performance.</p>

  <p>Michael and others just realized that they had missed something wonderful.</p>

  <p>"Take a look! What's that?" the middle-aged warrior said as he pointed at something besides Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Beside Luo Luo Zheng, there was a stunning girl tiptoeing on the ground and holding a huge sword. It was 30 feet long.</p>

  <p>Michael didn't expect this to happen. He was rooting for Owen moments ago, but then Luo Luo Zheng outperformed Owen. A bitter smile crossed his face. He said prudently, "I take back everything I have said. Luo Luo Zheng is an unpredictable warrior. His talent isn't limited in drawing runes. We can't just regard him as a runic expert. The girl beside him is a sword spirit, and this sword spirit has a human figure!"</p>
