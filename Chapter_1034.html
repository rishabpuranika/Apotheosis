</p>

  <p>The change was quite visible as Zheng's body steadily expanded. When he had previously shrunk, Margaret had put his old clothes away. But now as he was growing bigger, he was bare naked.</p>

  <p>As she stared at the scene in front of her, Xun was poker-faced.</p>

  <p>Margaret was glancing at Xun, her face slightly flushed. Although Margaret was not a stranger to Zheng's body, seeing another woman watch Zheng's body wasn't something she was used to.</p>

  <p>On second thought, she realized that Xun had been in Zheng's body all the time, so Xun probably knew him better than she did.</p>

  <p>In the past, Margaret had never thought about Xun's presence. Could it be possible that the intimate whispers she and Zheng shared when they made love fell into the ears of Xun? Upon realizing such an instance, Margaret's face turned even redder than it already was.</p>

  <p>Seeing Margaret's flushed cheeks, Xun became confused. However, Margaret had always been rather weird, so Xun didn't mind.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's body continued to enlarge, he quickly grew into the body of an eight-year-old, and then into a teenage boy of eleven or twelve years old.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Zheng's figure returned to his original appearance. Once again, he looked like his old twenty-year-old self.</p>

  <p>The two women looked eagerly at Zheng on the ground. Was he going to wake up?</p>

  <p>After waiting for a long time, Zheng's body suddenly trembled. Right after, he finally opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>In the Purple Power World, the sky was painted in a deep purple color.</p>

  <p>Streaks of purplish-black Aurora constantly circulated in the air, and on the horizon, an enormous purple sun emitted an unusual purple light.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?" Zheng looked at this unfamiliar environment and then noticed that Xun and Margaret were right beside him.</p>

  <p>Xun immediately replied, "This is the Purple Power World. Margaret brought you here."</p>

  <p>Not caring about anything else, Margaret threw herself into Zheng's embrace.</p>

  <p>The joy on her face was palpable.</p>

  <p>Zheng held onto Margaret and asked, "Where's Eddie?"</p>

  <p>Whether Eddie was still alive or dead was very important at the moment, and it was still Zheng's greatest concern.</p>

  <p>"He's still alive," Xun answered concisely.</p>

  <p>"He didn't die?" Zheng lowered his head and murmured, revealing a trace of regret on his face. However, he caught a glimpse of Yudie who was beside him from the corner of his eyes. His expression changed drastically as he pushed Margaret aside and extended his hand towards Yudie.</p>

  <p>Back in the battle, Eddie had shot out two gusts of Life and Death Wind, one hitting Zheng and the other hitting Yudie.</p>

  <p>Zheng understood how dangerous the Life and Death Wind was. Even the Ancient Tycoon had no way to resist it. Thanks to the Heavenly Fragment, Zheng was able to recover, but what about Yudie?</p>

  <p>As he examined her, Zheng could still feel Yudie's cold breath. It only meant that her body was somewhat alive, but the life energy coming from her was extremely weak.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's expression darken, Xun said, "The Life and Death Wind directly devours life energy, and the Law of Causality contained within it could kill anyone within its reach, so there's no way to resist it. Right now her life energy is almost completely exhausted."</p>

  <p>Zheng only nodded. Even the Ancient Tycoon himself died immediately after being hit by the Life and Death Wind. He and Yudie had survived most likely because of the Heavenly Fragment, which had offset parts of the Law of Causality. But now that Yudie was on the verge of death, how could he revive her?</p>

  <p>The reason why Zheng was able to fully recover was by taking advantage of the Law of Causality in the Heavenly Fragment.</p>

  <p>The reincarnation of a physical body made it possible for him to directly jump twenty years of longevity and once again grow to his current state.</p>

  <p>But what about Yudie? That same question played inside Zheng's head over and over again, too.</p>

  <p>Should he let her comprehend the laws held within the Heavenly Fragment as well?</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Zheng didn't hesitate and immediately placed the Heavenly Fragment on Yudie's chest.</p>

  <p>The three of them waited in silence for a while, but Yudie didn't have any reaction, and neither did the Heavenly Fragment.</p>

  <p>"It didn't work?" Zheng looked at Yudie's peaceful face. Her petite body rested on the ground as if she was only asleep. Zheng felt his heart twinge at the sight of her.</p>

  <p>The other two were also silent. Although Zheng didn't say anything, they knew Yudie's place in Zheng's heart. There was no way that Zheng could let her die like that.</p>

  <p>"Life energy... Xun, when we went to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, didn't you obtain the life energy from the holy tree?" Zheng asked with a glimmer of hope in his eyes. Even if he was unable to wake Yudie up now, as long as he could gather enough life energy, he had a way to save her.</p>

  <p>Back when Zheng and Xun were in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, she had absorbed almost all of the holy tree's life energy. If that energy could save Yudie, then he could bring her to the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>However, Xun shook her head and said, "It's no use. The life energy of the holy tree is very special, as the tree itself is connected to the hearts and minds of all the members of the Demon Night. The life energy is only suitable for the members of the Demon Night, and the other races cannot handle it. If Yudie were a member of the Demon Night, then what you have suggested might work."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Xun's words, Zheng fell silent once again.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Zheng's expression turned murderous. He suddenly stood up and clenched his fist tightly, his veins bulging on the back of his hand. Then, he stated coldly, "I will think of another way. No matter what, I will not let Yudie die!</p>

  <p>But Eddie… I will definitely kill him! Margaret, bring me back!" He was determined to finish his business.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's face boil with fury, Margaret's heart began to beat rapidly. The Zheng in front of her now was very different from the Zheng she once knew.</p>

  <p>Despite the sadness in her heart, Margaret only nodded in response. Yudie's current condition had angered Zheng beyond belief. 'If I was in her place, would he have felt the same way?' Margaret wondered.</p>

  <p>Deep inside her, Margaret wasn't very confident that Zheng would have reacted that way if it was her instead of Yudie. She had always believed that she would never match up to Yudie's importance to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Eddie continued to search the surroundings.</p>

  <p>"The people who know you the best would be often your enemies." Eddie also saw Zheng as his prime nemesis, so he knew very well how strong Zheng's luck was. As long as he didn't kill Zheng himself, that brat's luck always favored him.</p>

  <p>Although countless independent warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect had already been killed, they amounted to nothing more than cannon fodder.</p>

  <p>Even if he was now alone, he could still crush the entire Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Heavenly Evil Sect still had Simon, while the Oracle City didn't have any Life and Death Realm master left.</p>

  <p>The key issue was to kill Zheng, but that damned woman had actually hidden in the Purple Power World. He had searched for so long, but he had not been able to find the space node.</p>

  <p>Every time he made an erroneous move, more trouble came before him.</p>

  <p>If he had been the first one to take Margaret away, then this matter could not have occurred today, and his Lustful Demon Array could have already been completed.</p>

  <p>Despite his relentless efforts of chasing them, it was Zheng who successfully took Margaret away. It was him who took her virginity energy as well.</p>

  <p>What Eddie didn't expect was that Margaret had taken such a huge risk just to save Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>It was evident that Zheng's luck was much greater than his. The thought of this dejected Eddie. If it wasn't for the chain of cause and effect, he could've already killed Zheng, and his disciples of the Heavenly Evil Sect could've avoided the giant swords summoned by Margaret.</p>

  <p>On top of the city wall, many of the martial artists at the Virtual Tribulation Realm looked at this scene with cold eyes. As for the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance, they were stalemated by Simon. At that point in time, they were in no mood to fight.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the martial artists of the Oracle City, as long as Zheng was still alive, then they still had hope. If Zheng was truly dead, then everything was over.</p>

  <p>"I think we should just surrender," a martial artist at Virtual Tribulation Realm said faintly as he sat on top of the broken wall of the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>"We warriors of the World Commercial Alliance would rather die than submit. Why should we surrender to them?"</p>

  <p>Apparently, not everyone agreed to such an idea.</p>

  <p>"But facing Eddie, we do not have the strength to fight back. Why waste our lives?"</p>

  <p>"It's better to die a hero than live a dishonorable existence."</p>

  <p>Every martial artist at that moment had a different perspective towards the battle and its outcome. However, the majority of them didn't express their opinions. In their hearts, there was still a tiny bit of hope.</p>

  <p>At that same time, Eddie noticed a node floating through the air. His face instantly lit up, but a sinister look replaced it not long after, "Let me see how you'd survive this time, Zheng!"</p>
