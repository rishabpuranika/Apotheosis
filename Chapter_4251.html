  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey almost had never experienced any sort of hardship before. How could he tolerate such an intense pain now?</p>

  <p>At this moment, the pain had shut out his ability to think. He only hoped that he could pass out and escape the situation he was in somehow.</p>

  <p>However, the soul power continued to strengthen his soul, and at the same time, the pain that wrung through his entire body with it grew much stronger.</p>

  <p>It seemed like endless torture that refused to meet an end.</p>

  <p>He suffered in silence as the pain had him writhe and groan. It was killing him to have to tolerate it unwillingly. When he was about to open his mouth to release the pressure, the water forcefully poured itself in.</p>

  <p>His time of soul infusion was only thirty seconds longer than that of Elder Xue, but Geoffrey felt those minor seconds to be equal to those of a century.</p>

  <p>After it was over, Geoffrey remained in the water without moving for a while, staring up into space. His newly acquired powerful soul made him have a new perception of the world, so he just lay there, taking his moment to digest it all in.</p>

  <p>"My soul... I can feel it... How did it become so powerful?"</p>

  <p>After processing his thoughts and coming to terms with his newly acquired abilities, Geoffrey swam out of the transparent water. The moment his eyes made contact with Elder Xue, they reflected unparalleled momentum.</p>

  <p>Of course, Elder Xue quickly caught on with the change in Geoffrey at one glance.</p>

  <p>As a top-level master in the main world, Elder Xue's soul was extremely powerful. After he absorbed the soul power of the Fostering race, his soul power had increased by four times, but Geoffrey was different from him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was a mere True God in the chaos. Because of the difference in their status and abilities, after he went through the ordeal of absorbing the soul power of the Fostering race, his soul had probably grown exponentially.</p>

  <p>"This feeling... It's like no other I have ever felt. It's amazing!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey eyed himself up as he exclaimed with excitement. A while ago, he was writhing in pain and prayed for it to stop. But now, he seemed to have forgotten all about it after having obtained such great power in return. He felt as though he had been reborn.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue shared his excitement. It was indeed a great surprise that they could strengthen their souls to such a level. But soon as the excitement wore off and he began to collect his thoughts, he turned to Geoffrey and asked, "Why do you think they infuse such a surging soul power into us?"</p>

  <p>The Levitation Tower was the last-standing hope left by the Fostering race as a symbol of their existence before they were annihilated. They were an astute race, and nothing they did was pointless. There must have been a reason why they chose to strengthen Geoffrey's and Elder Xue's souls.</p>

  <p>"I guess we'll know when we go up," Geoffrey said as he pointed to the top of the tower.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue gave him a slight nod then continued to walk up the steps alongside him.</p>

  <p>After they left the transparent water, the green lines that once portrayed the path they could walk on disappeared.</p>

  <p>When they made their way onto the next floor, which was two hundred and ten feet high, they saw a ball appear before their eyes in the center.</p>

  <p>The ball hung loosely in the air. It was free of all imperfections. It was as if it was carved with utmost intricacy. There were no flaws on any side of it.</p>

  <p>However, just as they stared deeply at the ball, they suddenly felt themselves being slowly consumed with strong feelings of loneliness. The ball seemed to be in existence for as long as forever. It had no meaning attached to its life. It was without a beginning or an end.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with this ball?" Geoffrey asked in a concerned tone.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue kept his gaze fixated on the ball as he walked and gave his shoulders a light shrug, indicating his lack of knowledge about it as well.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a faint light appeared before them, stopping them in their tracks. The light continued to twist and changed its form continuously until it finally manifested itself into a little girl. It was the same little girl that Geoffrey had encountered several times in the previous illusions.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you again," the girl spoke indifferently with her hands clasped behind her back as she leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey began to look around in all directions in a frantic state before he asked nervously, "Is this an illusion, or is this real?"</p>

  <p>The little girl shook her head at his confusion and replied in a monotonous voice, "It's real."</p>

  <p>But Elder Xue could see through the little girl and tell that the girl herself was an illusion.</p>

  <p>"If that's really the case then... What are you doing here?" Geoffrey asked as he raised his brows.</p>

  <p>In fact, he understood that the little girl was somehow connected to the Levitation Tower. The Levitation Tower needed a person to communicate with Geoffrey. The little girl was created to serve that purpose.</p>

  <p>"I'll be your guide. Let me help you climb up from here on," the little girl said, her face devoid of all emotions as she beckoned them to follow her.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the offer, but I think we'll be fine on our own," Geoffrey said blatantly as he refused her help with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>The little girl paid no heed to his remark and pointed towards the lifeless ball. "This is the World of Nothingness. It is infinitely large and small at the same time. It contains everything, and yet it also remains empty. It's the first-grade world."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey still chose to ignore her and brushed her words aside. However, Elder Xue's expression switched drastically after he heard what she had to say. He pointed towards the ball and asked, "Are you telling me that this is the first-grade world? The real first-grade world?"</p>
