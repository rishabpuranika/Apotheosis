<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The already chaotic situation had gotten much worse, but the True Gods could only rely on themselves.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Star Door that Pascal and Reginald had set up was still a bit far away from the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>The root cause was that it was too late when the True Gods had found the Soul-killing Ghosts. Only a few of them who were close to the Star Door were able to get in, while most of them had to retreat and crawl up the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nelly had escaped into a new encirclement and looked at the numerous Soul-killing Ghosts that crawled on the ground. She couldn't help the chill that ran down her spine.</p>

  <p>"Kill them?" she asked simply.</p>

  <p>They didn't have enough time to talk too much.</p>

  <p>Now, the only way to get rid of the Soul-killing Ghosts was to kill them and run to the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God of the Mu Clan decided to not think twice about the overwhelming number of Soul-killing Ghosts. After all, how could he save others when he wasn't sure about avoiding their hooks in the air?</p>

  <p>"We don't have another choice," Luo Zheng said as another wave of thunder and lightning surged from his palm.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of blood red killing intent in Nelly's eyes, which seemed like she was possessed. Even both of her short swords became blood red and emitted a strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>It was the "Ghost-killing Sword" of the Murdering Divine Dao, which contained her killing intent from the soul. It could kill all kinds of evil spirits and ghosts of those who were wrongly put to death.</p>

  <p>The Ghost-killing Sword usually had magic to deal with the Soul-killing Ghosts, but there were too many of them. It was nearly impossible to do.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>He opened his palm, then quickly released several bolts of thunder.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the bolts of thunder from his palm were able to destroy several Soul-killing Ghosts in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nelly suddenly turned into a blood-red shadow and ran forward at a speed even faster than Luo Zheng's. Her eyes glittered like two rubies when she neared the Soul-killing Ghosts and she hissed, "Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>She wielded her two short swords in a crisscross motion and quickly cut a Soul-killing Ghost in front of her. She pulled her short swords to her sides, and then two arc-shaped blood lights spread out and cut four more Soul-killing Ghosts in half!</p>

  <p>At that moment, the two of them had cleared a path and immediately tried to escape the encirclement.</p>

  <p>However, countless hooks quietly rained down on them and completely blocked their path.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Nelly were clearly annoyed. With gritted teeth, they kept moving through the hooks and tried their best to dodge them.</p>

  <p>Although the two of them were extremely agile, some of the hooks caught up with the back of Luo Zheng's head and the tip of his nose. They fell down like raindrops which made it impossible to avoid them completely.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Liusu called out his real name subconsciously as she stared at him.</p>

  <p>She wanted to run to him, but Pascal stopped her.</p>

  <p>As for the True Gods, most of them had gotten to escape to the tree stump.</p>

  <p>They looked down at Luo Zheng and Nelly who were in the middle of the crisis and felt a bit lucky. "They can't be saved..." a True God said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Even Reginald and Soren didn't look too good, especially Soren.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had personally asked him a favor, so he was determined to protect Tianxing.</p>

  <p>He could fight with all his might if it had been any other evil creature.</p>

  <p>Hell, he was even sure that he could save Luo Zheng if it had been the Abyss Demons. Now, however, it was a completely different thing. He had no chance with those dense Soul-killing Ghosts. He could die if he tried to fight them.</p>

  <p>"This is bad!" Nelly screamed.</p>

  <p>She twisted her body to avoid one hook, but three other hooks violently went straight towards her and struck her brain.</p>

  <p>At the same time that Luo Zheng hastily retreated back, he felt a chill spread throughout his mind, and a hook pierced into his brain. His soul immediately felt painful. The hook had bitten his soul, and then pulled him out.</p>

  <p>Master Evil, who had been hiding in Luo Zheng's mind, was dumbfounded. He couldn't do anything about what just happened.</p>

  <p>That hook took out Luo Zheng's soul while several other hooks joined in and bit his soul as well, then pulling him towards the Soul-killing Ghosts.</p>

  <p>He could only imagine what would happen to him after those Soul-killing Ghosts had dragged his soul away? they would devour him.</p>

  <p>When the hooks had pulled his soul, he saw that the same thing had happened to Nelly. She looked absolutely terrified as her soul was dragged to one direction.</p>

  <p>The True Gods on the tree stump could do nothing but sigh defeatedly.</p>

  <p>They saw that Luo Zheng's and Nelly's bodies stood still, which meant that they had lost their souls.</p>

  <p>Despite the horrible situation, a smile crept up Langston's face as he had climbed higher. He felt very pleased that Tianxing was killed right there.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey kept shaking their heads in distress. "That's impossible. He won't die so easily," they lamented.</p>

  <p>Just then, Liusu stared at Luo Zheng and released her perception to chase after his soul. "His soul hasn't been torn apart yet," she murmured. She couldn't help but hold on to a glimmer of hope before Luo Zheng's soul had been torn to pieces, even though it was so slim.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land focused on those consummate True Gods most of the time, but the incident in the valley caught their attentions again.</p>

  <p>"That young man is going to die in the hands of the Soul-killing Ghosts," whispered a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Nicholas remained calm. Even though he wanted to take Luo Zheng as his disciple, such a thing had always depended on fate. The female leader of the Sun Blind race didn't allow Holy Beings to enter the Time Sea Forbidden Land, so Nicholas couldn't save Luo Zheng. "It's indeed a pity..." he sighed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Joy was staring at Luo Zheng with a seriousness and a vague sadness in her eyes. She didn't believe that he would die just like that.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's soul rapidly fell down, and then he saw the Soul-killing Ghosts crawl on the ground and surround him. Those Soul-killing Ghosts were souls that did not even hide their greedy auras at all. They opened their big mouths wide and couldn't wait to tear him to pieces.</p>

  <p>'Is there no other choice?' he groaned quietly. His heart couldn't help but feel heavy.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the surface of his soul suddenly burst out golden lights, which turned into golden sword shadows and spun around his soul.</p>

  <p>His soul had grown significantly ever since he had cultivated the Evolutionary Divine Arts in the universe. Furthermore, his soul strength was on par with that of a True God even when he was only a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>After he was promoted to a low-rank True God, his soul had greatly improved.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Emotion Closing Divine Dao had everything to do with the soul. As his soul became stronger, he had comprehended the most crucial move? the Ripping Consciousness of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Thus, it could be said that his soul had also gone through the training of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>If he used it without careful consideration, the other True Gods would discover his secret. Thus, Luo Zheng rarely used his soul power after entering the divine land. In the Heavenly Han House, he had used his soul power alone, but hadn't activated the golden sword shadows on the surface of his soul.</p>

  <p>In addition, it wasn't a good idea to trigger the Emotion Closing Divine Dao in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. It was a forbidden skill, so it was destined to be a Divine Dao that nobody was allowed to practice. Now, he didn't know if those Holy Beings would let him go when they saw his situation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, had no choice at all when he came to such a situation. The only thing he could do was to live first.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the golden sword shadows appeared and emitted rays of golden light that scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>Although the golden light belonged to the soul power, it was so strong that it could even flatten a mountain back when Luo Zheng was still in the universe. Now that his cultivation base had increased, it was even more powerful now.</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing ghosts that came from various directions were already about to bite his soul, but the golden lights had turned into arrow-shaped offensive forces and violently flew everywhere before they could even open their mouths.</p>
