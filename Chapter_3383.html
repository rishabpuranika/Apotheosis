  <p>
</p>

  <p>In theory, no such thing as perfect exists in the world.</p>

  <p>Even the most powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm were also flawed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, still couldn't figure out those powerful warriors' flaws with his current abilities.</p>

  <p>He had used the Eye of Will to disturb Chance's mind back in the Phoenix Palace, but he had never truly used it to detect his flaws.</p>

  <p>Chance had already undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, so it was not easy to find a flaw in his body.</p>

  <p>But the queen ant in front of Luo Zheng was different from Chance.</p>

  <p>"Sword Texture Technique!"</p>

  <p>"Eye of Will!"</p>

  <p>A bright beam of white light flashed, and then a remarkably clear world materialized around Luo Zheng. It was known as the Authentic Visual World.</p>

  <p>In this world, everything was covered by lines.</p>

  <p>Sally and Chaim were no exception.</p>

  <p>The lines enabled Luo Zheng to see everyone's level of strength.</p>

  <p>For instance, Chaim's fighting ability had dropped sharply, but his body was an integral whole. He was protecting his flaws, although it was unknown if he did it intentionally or unintentionally.</p>

  <p>He didn't practice the Sword Texture Technique. He had his instincts which he gained from his rich experience in battle.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the flaws of Sally and the members of the other races were almost the same.</p>

  <p>The queen ant was a whole in the Authentic Visual World, just like what Luo Zheng had seen before.</p>

  <p>"The queen ant has no flaws?</p>

  <p>It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>He couldn't possibly believe such a thing. Since the queen ant hadn't completed the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, he believed that he could find a flaw.</p>

  <p>As its white jaws came for him again, Luo Zheng bowed and then jumped up, his long sword in one hand. He didn't attack the queen ant, but simply stared at it.</p>

  <p>"What? What is he doing?" Chaim asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"He has stopped attacking. Is he going to give up?" the member of the Moon Spirit race said with a frown.</p>

  <p>The queen ant had the Chaotic Source Spirits in its belly, which made it invincible, but Luo Zheng's current abilities made it easy for him to escape.</p>

  <p>The only thing was he wouldn't be able to get any Chaotic Source Spirit if he did so. Naturally, the others were slightly upset because of it.</p>

  <p>Of course, they still didn't dare to say anything because after all, Luo Zheng was the one fighting and not them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng will not give up," said Sally firmly. Yet, there was a trace of doubt on her face. What on earth was Luo Zheng doing? It seemed like he was observing the queen ant. However, what was the point of examining it like that?</p>

  <p>As Chaim watched Luo Zheng constantly dodge the queen ant while he observed it, something suddenly clicked in his head.</p>

  <p>As one of the most outstanding disciples in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, it was not difficult for him to get a supreme swordsmanship manual. He had even read some of the supreme swordsmanship manuals in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Since Luo Zheng is a member of the Heart Flow Sect, he should mainly cultivate the Flow Strike. He had previously employed a strike of the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship. Is it possible that, in addition to these two, he has also cultivated the Sword Texture Technique?"</p>

  <p>Every supreme swordsmanship manual represented a peak-level swordsmanship. None of them was better than the others, because their focuses were different.</p>

  <p>It was no doubt that one had to put in a lot of effort to comprehend a supreme swordsmanship manual. Not long after Luo Zheng had joined the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he had spent a lot of time on the Other Shore and at the same time, had also learned several supreme swordsmanship manuals. Chaim was very surprised at this thought.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that Luo Zheng had learned the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship as well!</p>

  <p>"Is the queen ant really flawless?" Luo Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He then activated the power of the Eye of Will, and the white light in his right eye glowed brighter as the pressure increased.</p>

  <p>More and more lines came to his sight. The cracks in the space began to emerge.</p>

  <p>"I see it! There is a flaw over there!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Finally, he had found a tiny line on the queen ant's back.</p>

  <p>That one small line was very important to him.</p>

  <p>As soon as the queen ant turned around, he glided through the air like a flying bird and landed on its belly. He shot out the sword light in a flash and then swiftly fled away.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Such a sword attack didn't seem to have much power. Chaim and the others thought that it was simply like tickling the queen ant. It didn't appear to have any effects on it at all.</p>

  <p>Yet at that moment, the amber Chaotic Source Spirits in the queen ant's belly dimmed a little.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Why did the Chaotic Source Spirits become dark?"</p>

  <p>"That strike just now should be very ordinary..."</p>

  <p>The members of the Celestial Wolf race, the Lofty Mountain race, and the Moon Spirit race looked at each other in confusion. They had no idea what Luo Zheng had done.</p>

  <p>Chaim had so many theories about Luo Zheng for a while. The corners of his mouth twitched upwards as he watched the current scene. It looked like Luo Zheng had fully mastered the Sword Texture Technique, but the queen ant had swallowed so many powerful Chaotic Source Spirits. Thus, Luo Zheng shouldn't be able to find its flaw, unless he had some special ability.</p>

  <p>The queen ant became enraged after Luo Zheng had stabbed it. Its tentacles shook, and a strong force burst out from its head. Its fat body became more flexible, and then it chased after Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as it was about to catch up with Luo Zheng, Sally flung her Iridescent Stone and hit the queen ant hard on the head.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>In return, Luo Zheng seized the opportunity and immediately swung his sword.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>At that point, the queen ant's amber Chaotic Source Spirits became dimmer.</p>

  <p>According to the records of the Sword Texture Technique, attacking this line was not fatal, but it was enough to cause damage to the queen ant.</p>

  <p>Still, the Chaotic Source Spirits were so powerful that they could bear all the damage for the queen ant.</p>

  <p>So after Luo Zheng had attacked the line, the power of the Chaotic Source Spirits could be quickly consumed.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>Clank!</p>

  <p>He didn't fight the queen ant head on, but instead took the chance to strike with his sword again.</p>

  <p>If the distance was too long, he would attack with his sword radiance.</p>

  <p>The queen ant's reaction was quick, but given its body structure, it couldn't protect the thin line. It was beaten, but it couldn't do anything to Luo Zheng no matter how hard it tried to fight back.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng stabbed with his sword for more than ten times, the Chaotic Source Spirits in the queen ant's stomach were exhausted and turned into gray particles.</p>

  <p>Once that was done, Sally threw out her Iridescent Stone again!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The Iridescent Stone hit the queen ant's belly hard and its belly crumpled on itself.</p>

  <p>Sally's eyes were filled with delight! "The queen ant is dying!" she exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The queen ant was in a great deal of pain. Its two tentacles collided against each other as it let out a strange, roar-like sound.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the other races joined the fight. The queen ant had lost the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits, and couldn't defend itself anymore.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, bruises were scattered all over its body.</p>

  <p>Despite having drained its Chaotic Source Spirits, the queen ant still had its powerful Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Alas, the queen ant couldn't release enough strength after its Chaotic Source Spirits were spent, and its body became much weaker.</p>

  <p>It unleashed its Other Shore Power for the last time and then rushed to the stone pillar like a galloping rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>In fact, the stone pillar was not the queen ant's lair. Its actual shelter was a huge maze that connected to the bottom of the cave, stretching thousands of feet.</p>

  <p>The queen ant had only appeared because Luo Zheng had slaughtered all of its offspring.</p>

  <p>The queen ant was full of regret. If it had known such a thing would happen, it would've hidden in its lair instead, and wouldn't have ended up in misery.</p>

  <p>It didn't expect that this young human man could find its only flaw!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The moment the queen ant was about to go into the cave under the pillar, Luo Zheng threw his long sword.</p>

  <p>The sharp silver sword went directly through the queen ant's head, and pinned it to the ground.</p>
