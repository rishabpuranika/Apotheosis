  <p>
</p>

  <p>A hint of fear could be seen in Xuanyuan's eyes.</p>

  <p>Before the Snake Goddess made a move, they wouldn't know what the result would be.</p>

  <p>"If the Black Ship wants to mess things up, then everything will change. We need to take action according to the situation," said Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>He had hoped for things to be under control, but that was not what it was at the moment.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan raised the sword in his hand, the golden light around it shining brightly.</p>

  <p>This sword light seemed to follow a holy path. This sword strike seemed invincible and looked like it could destroy everything in the world.</p>

  <p>"Will our choice be worth it?" Divine Farmer asked, worried. He was still uneasy about the developments and thought it wrong to go against the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"The gift of fate has already been marked with a price. Perhaps it's time for us to pay back," Xuanyuan said, jumping up.</p>

  <p>The golden light enveloped his sword. It looked like he was holding a torch and his own holy path.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm masters like Xuanyuan, Divine Farmer and Mahoney were shocked at the death of Emperor Di Jun. They were now doubting the path they had chosen.</p>

  <p>But there was no point doubting themselves now. They were destined to not be able to get rid of the Element Spirit race. What was more, they had placed all their bets on the Element Spirit race a long time ago.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race didn't extend their help and support for free, and it was now time for them to pay the price.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The golden light soared into the sky and then began to pour down.</p>

  <p>It was as if someone had pierced through the sun with a sword and caused the flames to flow down the sun's body.</p>

  <p>But that wasn't a flame. It was the holy way, a comprehension exclusive to Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>"Good timing!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi exclaimed, his face lighting up.</p>

  <p>He trembled with excitement, not having met an opponent of this level in a long time.</p>

  <p>The golden holy path poured down, an inexplicable aura surrounding it.</p>

  <p>The weaker disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace bent down to kneel before the holy path.</p>

  <p>It took a lot of energy even for powerful and strong-minded warriors like Li Bianxue to resist the aura.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared on the golden holy path.</p>

  <p>Fuxi then threw a punch at this mark, a boom resounding through the people present.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's punch smashed the invincible and overbearing-looking holy way into pieces.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Fuxi had also disappeared along with the holy path.</p>

  <p>But in the next moment, he appeared behind Xuanyuan, with a mark of Eight Diagrams on Xuanyuan's back.</p>

  <p>"I have disliked you for a long time!" Fuxi said as he prepared to throw a punch.</p>

  <p>As long as the mark of Eight Diagrams remained with him, this punch would definitely hit its target.</p>

  <p>There were very few people in this world who could resist Fuxi's punch.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan, who had turned around at Fuxi's words, swung his sword towards Fuxi's fist.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan would suffer greatly against Fuxi's fist, but if his sword were to pierce into Fuxi's fist, it would disable one of his arms for the time being.</p>

  <p>Fuxi frowned and lowered his hand, dodging Xuanyuan's sword. He wanted to attack him again.</p>

  <p>But Xuanyuan's sword was still aimed at Fuxi's fist after it had drawn a circle.</p>

  <p>After a while, it looked like they were sparring with each other. The way they were fighting looked strange and absurd, but they were in great danger.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was an irritable man. He retreated a thousand feet in the air, gathering all his energies to throw another punch. But Xuanyuan merely smiled as he said, "It's too late."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The mark on Xuanyuan's back exploded with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>The mark of Eight Diagrams lasted for a while and would automatically explode if Fuxi didn't trigger it.</p>

  <p>The explosion was powerful enough to be impressive, but it was nothing to Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked at Xuanyuan, his face devoid of expression, and said,</p>

  <p>"You haven't made any progress over all these years."</p>

  <p>"I've made enough to defeat you!"</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan had raised his sword up before him so that it was parallel to the ground. As the golden light boomed again, the two top masters of the Source World dove in to fight each other once again.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan had just made his move when Divine Farmer made his way across the space to Phoenix's side, one hand on the red crystal.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was very clear about the fact that someone else would be attacking Luo Zheng. But he had no choice but to go all out while facing Xuanyuan.</p>

  <p>He'd face defeat if he so much as got distracted one tiny bit. That was why he couldn't protect Luo Zheng at the moment.</p>

  <p>"Let go of him and I won't kill you," Divine Farmer said, staring at Phoenix.</p>

  <p>The old man was not unfamiliar to Phoenix.</p>

  <p>She had come into contact with Divine Farmer several times when she had followed Emperor Di Jun. This was how they were familiar with each other.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that," Phoenix said, shrugging.</p>

  <p>"So be it. You should know that I'm not going to let you off even if Emperor Di Jun is still alive," Divine Farmer said, wiggling his hand and causing a jade ruler to pop out of his arm.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer Ruler was his life's treasure, which could both kill and save people.</p>

  <p>He waved the ruler around before throwing a deadly-looking strike at Phoenix.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the Divine Farmer Ruler was going to kill people. As Divine Farmer waved the ruler around, the smell of blood permeated the air around them. If the weaker ones were to take even one sip, their skin and flesh would rot and they would turn into dried bones.</p>

  <p>Now that she was facing an Eternal Realm master who was even stronger than Emperor Di Jun, Phoenix didn't know how to fight back.</p>

  <p>She lowered her body in order to avoid the Divine Farmer Ruler and moved behind the crystal.</p>

  <p>Since Divine Farmer and Phoenix were previously acquainted, he showed her some mercy. But if he were to use all his strength, he would definitely kill her.</p>

  <p>However, after Phoenix had dodged him by hiding behind the red crystal, the surging divine flames of the Jin Wu shot towards Divine Farmer along the red crystal, and in an instant, surrounded him.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The divine flames of the Jin Wu still couldn't destroy Divine Farmer's Chaotic Source Spirits, but Divine Farmer was angry. "You're reckless, aren't you?" he spat out. "You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>Thick green light flashed out from the center of the Divine Farmer Ruler and turned into a green, thumb-sized hummingbird.</p>

  <p>The hummingbird devoured the divine flames of the Jin Wu on the surface of Divine Farmer's body, and then charged towards Phoenix.</p>

  <p>"Venomous Candle Hummingbird!" Phoenix said knowingly.</p>

  <p>She was experienced and knowledgeable, and knew that this token of Divine Farmer was formidable.</p>

  <p>If she didn't retreat now, this little hummingbird would definitely kill her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Phoenix loosened her grip and entered the space channel, simultaneously appearing at a spot thousands of feet away.</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows furrowed in indignation.</p>

  <p>The gap between her strength and Divine Farmer's was too great.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that she was no match for him.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer was about to move away with the red crystal when a cloud of black smoke suddenly appeared on the surface of the red crystal.</p>

  <p>The black smoke had a special characteristic that allowed it to drill into the red crystal.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Filthy Smoke?"</p>

  <p>Phoenix was surprised to see the black smoke.</p>

  <p>Anything that was tainted with the Filthy Smoke couldn't be transferred through space channels.</p>

  <p>Half of Divine Farmer's body had already drilled into the space channel. He didn't know what was happening outside. When he grabbed the red crystal and tried to stuff it into the channel, he discovered that he couldn't do it.</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to drill out of the space channel. On inspection, he found that an Ear Mouse was holding a cigarette pipe and blowing out black smoke.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Tomos, the betrayer of the Ear Mouse race and a member of the Black Ship.</p>
