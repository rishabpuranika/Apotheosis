  <p>
</p>

  <p>A knowing look flashed across Luo Zheng's eyes. Ambrose's request did not come as a surprise to him.</p>

  <p>After all, he had brought a massive amount of divine crystals from the divine land with him, which were originally resources that belonged to the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, Chiyou had entrusted Luo Zheng with some arrangements, although it was No. 9527 who received the task.</p>

  <p>The remaining members of the Nine Li race had lost all hope, but that changed when Luo Zheng arrived.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Qiu Yinhe's eyes gleamed and his face became unreadable.</p>

  <p>To be honest, the Taiyi Heaven Palace didn't invest many resources in Luo Zheng's cultivation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to climb up the mountain in the Taiyi Heaven Palace because of his own efforts.</p>

  <p>In addition, he brought many benefits to the palace.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng ever chose to leave, Qiu Yinhe knew that he had no reason to stop him.</p>

  <p>So before Luo Zheng could speak, he quickly cupped his hands towards Ambrose and said, "Master Ambrose, may I say something?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose glanced at him and answered, "Please, go ahead."</p>

  <p>Back then, Ambrose was a hero of indomitable spirit in the Source World.</p>

  <p>He enjoyed a status that was equal to those of the heads of the seven mountains of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. At that time, Qiu Yinhe was much inferior to him.</p>

  <p>The times, however, had changed. The Nine Li race had declined and was long past their prime. Moreover, both Ambrose's body and soul had been badly damaged, and he hadn't been able to recover since. He was no longer as strong as he used to be.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has made rapid progress ever since he joined the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>I have heard from him many times about his determination and eagerness to rebuild the Nine Li race. The Nine Li race is truly lucky to have such a descendant. I have no doubt that he will be a man of great power in the future," said Qiu Yinhe. He paused for a bit and then continued, "But Master Ambrose, you should be more aware of the current situation of the Nine Li race than I am. Luo Zheng can return to you if he wants, but how can you cultivate him right now? Apart from anything else, if the Chaotic Source World opens, do you have a ticket for him? Can you bring him there safely?"</p>

  <p>It was known that the Nine Li race used to be a large, dominant force. They couldn't be underestimated despite their downfall. Furthermore, there was more than one group like the one Ambrose led, which was the reason the Bearing race always chased after them.</p>

  <p>That was also why the remaining members of the Nine Li race had to hide themselves from the world. As a result, it was impossible for them to expand or even accumulate resources. They now lived even more cautiously on the Other Shore and the world in general.</p>

  <p>It also went without saying that they couldn't enter the Chaotic Source World publicly.</p>

  <p>Sally and Hutton exchanged silent glances. They were worried about the tickets to the Chaotic Source World as well.</p>

  <p>As the outstanding talents of the younger generation of the Nine Li race, crossing the thirteen stages in the Lust world wasn't a big problem for them.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, it was useless to improve only their souls. Therefore, they had to go to the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>A trace of sadness appeared on Ambrose's face after he heard what Qiu Yinhe said.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe felt sorry for Ambrose. After all, he highly respected Ambrose as his senior. It was just that Ambrose had lost his power and influence now.</p>

  <p>"Well, when Luo Zheng joined the Taiyi Heaven Palace, I told him that he could leave at any time and we wouldn't stop him, but now is not the right time for him to return to the Nine Li race. If he is strong enough to lead the Nine Li race in the future, then I will have no objection," he continued.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Ambrose's downcast face revealed a crafty smile. He replied, "As you said, it's unrealistic for Luo Zheng to come back to the Nine Li race right now.</p>

  <p>I can't represent the entire Nine Li race, either. So, Luo Zheng can stay in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but on one condition."</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe's voice was solemn as he mouthed, "Please, go ahead."</p>

  <p>"I have brought several clansmen here. Could you please take care of them and bring them into the Chaotic Source World?" The smile on Ambrose's lips stretched a bit wider.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Qiu Yinhe were stunned.</p>

  <p>The two never expected that Ambrose had such a plan in his mind.</p>

  <p>Before Qiu Yinhe could say anything, Ambrose sighed heavily and continued, "Alas, we have no other choice now. Even if we did get the tickets, it would still be hard for them to enter the Chaotic Source World. I will be deeply grateful if you can help them."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly turned to Qiu Yinhe and said, "Master Qiu Yinhe, please report to the Taiyi Heaven Palace and recruit my clansmen. The tickets to the Chaotic Source World are precious, and I'll bear the cost."</p>

  <p>If the Taiyi Heaven Palace could not get the tickets, Luo Zheng planned to buy them from the Ear Mice. He believed that the shrewd Ear Mice would not refuse his request.</p>

  <p>It was quite some time before Qiu Yinhe finally came to his senses. 'Ambrose is smart. He knows that the remaining people of the Nine Li race can't cultivate Luo Zheng, so he has no plan to take him back. On the one hand, he personally came to the Taiyi Heaven Palace to meet Luo Zheng; on the other hand, he wants the Taiyi Heaven Palace to recruit his clansmen. That's why he took the younger generation with him, ' he internally groaned.</p>

  <p>Under everyone's gaze, Qiu Yinhe put on a smile and said, "Although the tickets to the Chaotic Source World are difficult to get, I can get five or six more. Luo Zheng, you don't have to worry about that."</p>

  <p>Sally, Hutton, and the other members of the Nine Li race beamed at Qiu Yinhe's response. They didn't expect that he would agree so easily.</p>

  <p>After their discussion, Ambrose told Luo Zheng about the situation of the Nine Li race's remaining members to let him have a general understanding of it.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the situation of the Nine Li race was even worse than Luo Zheng had imagined. Almost all of the race's important inheritances were destroyed. After the Bearing race had defeated them, some of their clansmen even used a few forbidden secret methods to change their blood, and cut off their ties to the Nine Li race. Meanwhile, all the other races that had once surrendered to the Nine Li race launched counterattacks.</p>

  <p>"In reality, we have long lost hope. Leopold found us after a great deal of effort, but I scolded him. Chiyou sent the divine land away after he went through many hardships. Why should we bring it back? Leopold shouldn't have brought you back to the Source World," said Ambrose regretfully. "I didn't expect that Lorena would have such an excellent son. It's a pity that I can do nothing to help you."</p>

  <p>Sally and Hutton had previously told Ambrose what Luo Zheng had done on the Other Shore, and in that moment, he felt hopeful. Now that he had confirmed Luo Zheng's identity, he felt as if victory was in sight.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, he bowed and said goodbye to Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>He stood up and beckoned his companions to leave. Qiu Yinhe saw them off.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he just stood there and balled his fists. He had seen the statues of the nine chieftains in the divine land. All of them were strong and powerful. Today, however, Ambrose was quite different from the statue in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had already known that the Nine Li race had declined, he couldn't help but feel sad. He cried out, "Grandpa Ambrose."</p>

  <p>Ambrose and the others paused. They turned around and smiled at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I will rebuild the Nine Li race in your lifetime," Luo Zheng said seriously.</p>

  <p>A wild laugh escaped from Ambrose's lips. Then he croaked, "I have been cursed, and I'm dying. I hope you can fulfill this promise!"</p>

  <p>Then he, Leopold, and the others left the Splendid Palace without another word.</p>
