</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The door banged shut tightly.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Guards threw Zheng, Gant, and Raphael out.</p>

  <p>"Why was I kicked out?" Raphael said, a bitter smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Gant stood still, looking desperate.</p>

  <p>"Gant, you don't have to worry. They won't be so cruel to Eira. Besides, her bloodline is so rare that they won't want to lose her," Raphael said in an attempt to comfort Gant.</p>

  <p>Gant glared at Raphael before retorting, "Do you think my father is not heartless enough to Eira? Look at her! She looks like she's dying!"</p>

  <p>Raphael frowned as he said, "Gant, I have to remind you that you and Eira are cousins. You can't marry her."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense are you talking about?" Gant's expression changed.</p>

  <p>"I was just reminding you," Raphael said, chuckling.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and shook his head at their conversation. "We must consider everything carefully before making a decision. Besides, your uncle is right.</p>

  <p>Since Eira's bloodline is so special and valuable, they won't let her die."</p>

  <p>The array not only extracted Eira's blood, but also kept replenishing her blood vitality. As long as her blood vitality was replenished in time, the array would not kill her.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Guards and the Su Clan had tried their best to detain her. So it was impossible for the three of them to take her away, especially since they didn't have a proper excuse to do so.</p>

  <p>Gant believed Zheng, but he didn't think they were able to take his cousin away.</p>

  <p>Gant and Zheng were just about to leave when a roar resounded from high above them.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked up to see a faint shadow appear in the air above the Blue Cloud City.</p>

  <p>He frowned at the sight.</p>

  <p>The Cage of Heaven and Earth had covered the entirety of the Mountain Viewing Province. How could anyone in the Mountain Viewing Province use the Grand Teleportation?</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that the shadow was gradually condensing under his gaze. Two wings, each a hundred feet wide, spread out, revealing a half-naked woman at their center.</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes were closed, as if she was not awake, and her body emitted a faint golden light.</p>

  <p>She flapped her wings gently and they wrapped up her entire body within them. The golden light then suddenly shot out in four directions.</p>

  <p>"The directions of the four golden lights!" Zheng's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>Even Cailen, who had just let Zheng, Gant and Raphael out, was shocked to see this, along with a few high-level members of the Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>The directions in which the four golden lights had shot were the four Arrays of Innumerable Swords in the Blue Cloud City!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Each Array of Innumerable Swords was guarded by more than ten Oneness Guards, including a five-star Oneness Guard.</p>

  <p>When these Oneness Guards saw the golden lights shooting towards them, they immediately raised an alarm.</p>

  <p>Woo...</p>

  <p>But it took a long time for the Arrays of Innumerable Swords to absorb the divine crystals.</p>

  <p>After the Cage of Heaven and Earth was activated, the humans and the Sun Crow members couldn't use the Grand Teleportation anymore, which was why the Oneness Guards hadn't expected the half-naked woman to use the Grand Teleportation and launch a sudden attack.</p>

  <p>The four golden lights hovered above the four arrays, waiting for the woman's next order.</p>

  <p>The woman, who was still suspended in the air, said, "Truth of Holy Words, Golden Light Extinction."</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The four golden lights poured down from the sky like four torrents of water.</p>

  <p>"Step back!"</p>

  <p>When the Oneness Guards guarding the Arrays of Innumerable Swords felt the power of the golden lights, only one thought was on their minds: to run for their lives.</p>

  <p>They couldn't resist the formidable energy attack, and they didn't want to be destroyed with the arrays. So all they could do was run.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Four loud bangs set the whole Blue Cloud City shaking.</p>

  <p>As the four golden lights poured down, the four Arrays of Innumerable Swords were destroyed.</p>

  <p>The woman looked down upon the Blue Cloud City. Her lips turned up into a faint smile, turning up her charm multi-fold. Her wings flapped before she turned into a faint shadow and vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>In the face of the sudden attack, the Blue Cloud City was in a mess.</p>

  <p>"Space is confined by the Cage of Heaven and Earth, so no one can use the Grand Teleportation, right? How did that woman do it?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Gant and Raphael didn't have any answer to this.</p>

  <p>There was one thought on all of their minds. Now that the four Arrays of Innumerable Swords had been destroyed, the Sun Crow race would not let go of this opportunity. They could only imagine what was going to happen to the Blue Cloud City in the future.</p>

  <p>"The Cage of Heaven and Earth is a good method, but there is still a way to break it with the Truth of Void Destruction and some special Other Shore Token. The woman who had just appeared was just an Illusory Projection.</p>

  <p>Her real body wasn't here," explained No. 9527.</p>

  <p>It would answer all of Zheng's questions unless they were related to the depths of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"What? The woman was just an Illusory Projection? But she possessed such strength!" Zheng said, his eyebrows rising in shock.</p>

  <p>The force contained in the golden lights could probably have reached ten thousand divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Even an Illusory Projection could release this level of strength. Zheng couldn't help but wonder how powerful the woman's real body must be.</p>

  <p>Zheng was deep in thought when a loud voice sounded from inside the Blue Cloud City, spreading throughout the entirety of the city.</p>

  <p>"All Oneness Guards and followers, please retreat to the center of the Blue Cloud City!"</p>

  <p>The warriors in the Blue Cloud City had relied on the four great arrays to keep the Sun Crow race outside.</p>

  <p>But now that the four arrays had been destroyed, the Sun Crow race would definitely take the opportunity to invade them. There was no point in defending the city. The senior leaders of the Oneness Guards gave the order to gather all the warriors in the center of the city to protect the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array.</p>

  <p>People from all directions gathered in the center of the city.</p>

  <p>Gant panicked as he looked at the crowd. "Flag Master, what should we do now?"</p>

  <p>"Let's stay here and wait," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Inside the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Cailen, saw the warriors gathering in the center of the city.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" asked a weapon refiner from the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"We are running out of time!" said Ruben as he looked at the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone was so solid, it couldn't be destroyed no matter how many thousands or even tens of thousands of divine megatons of force hit it.</p>

  <p>But the blood of the Su Clan members could get into it. Only by using the blood as a guide and cooperating with the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array could they mold the Shade Stone into whatever shape they wanted.</p>

  <p>They also needed time to mold the stone into a different shape, and right now, that was what they didn't have.</p>

  <p>"There is only one way," said Cailen, his eyebrows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Ableson asked.</p>

  <p>"The Shade Stone has now absorbed enough blood. Let's try our best to activate the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array to melt the stone and take it away from here," Cailen said.</p>

  <p>At this, Ruben frowned and said, "But in this case, the quality of the Shade Stone will decrease."</p>

  <p>"It's better than the Sun Crow race taking the stone," retorted Cailen.</p>

  <p>This was their last resort, and they were not willing to do it unless there was no other option.</p>

  <p>Cailen had just made this decision when a dark cloud appeared a hundred miles from the Blue Cloud City. It was filled with countless red light dots.</p>
