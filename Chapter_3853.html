<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just then, several people joined hands to take away Luo Zheng's red crystal.</p>

  <p>After Tomos stopped the crystal from being taken away with the smoke, he and Shera respectively used the illusion skill and the controlling technique to confuse Divine Farmer's judgment.</p>

  <p>And indeed, Divine Farmer misjudged.</p>

  <p>The 'bamboo pole' untied his bandage to wrap around the red crystal.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, another Black Ship member's skill was used to replace the red crystal with the stone.</p>

  <p>It was the brass man who dragged the bandage, and he had a unique secret technique that allowed him to increase his strength threefold in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Once he activated the technique, the brass man was powerful enough to fight against even an Eternal Realm master.</p>

  <p>In truth, if Divine Farmer was on full alert, even the Black Ship members could have a difficult time taking Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>But Divine Farmer had always been on guard against the Black Ship's captain. Because he didn't quite take these people seriously, they found their chance to take action.</p>

  <p>Now, in Divine Farmer's towering rage, he swung his ruler, slashing it down. The broken space spread all the way toward the space flying ship.</p>

  <p>Inside, the members of the Black Ship had just brought in the red crystal, while Shera was leaning against the crystal to observe.</p>

  <p>Just then, a crack in the sky rapidly spread over, shocking everyone with the sight.</p>

  <p>"He found us out so soon." Tomo's eyes were full of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"An Eternal Realm master naturally has the ability mysterious to anyone else. Edith, just transfer to another space." Shera turned around and gave the order.</p>

  <p>In the corner of the space ship sat a blue-skinned woman with long locks.</p>

  <p>Her Other Shore Token was passed to her by the Grandmaster of Heaven. It was the transparent flying ship docking in the void and happened to be the Invisible Ship in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, even an Eternal Realm master would find it difficult to find this ship? it wasn't one that could be easily sniffed out.</p>

  <p>But the Black Ship people never expected Divine Farmer to make use of Usman's ability. Since the latter took control of the entire Separate Amber Province, everything there was in his view.</p>

  <p>"Okay, Shera." Edith nodded.</p>

  <p>She had a rather pitiful background? her very race had been exterminated, leaving solely her behind.</p>

  <p>While she had never been particularly famous in the Black Ship, the other members of the Black Ship, Shera most especially, had always treated her very well.</p>

  <p>In turn, Edith also treated Shera as her very own big sister.</p>

  <p>With a flash of light in her gray eyes, the Invisible Ship suddenly collapsed, and the ruler of Divine Farmer then failed to hit it.</p>

  <p>The entire space was concentrated at a single point. In the next moment, Edith had controlled the Invisible Ship, making it appear in another location a hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>But the distance of a hundred miles was nothing to an Eternal Realm master.</p>

  <p>Still, Edith and the rest of the Black Ship were highly confident in the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer couldn't discover it too soon, regardless.</p>

  <p>But once Divine Farmer saw the ship disappear, his face grew dark as the eye in his forehead flashed again.</p>

  <p>Usman was getting up from the ground.</p>

  <p>The force of twisting his neck came from his own body just now, so this force was not transferred to the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>In his confusion, he felt that his eyes bulged, dragging his entire head to twist.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>This time, Usman was smarter about it.</p>

  <p>So he merely jumped up and rotated his body along with the direction his eyeballs were circling in.</p>

  <p>He had to turn in a full circle before his eyes recovered.</p>

  <p>But the situation still left him just as clueless.</p>

  <p>After finding the ship through Usman's eyes, Divine Farmer advanced again, slashing his ruler in the ship's direction.</p>

  <p>The motion completely shocked Edith.</p>

  <p>She was certain to leave no clue whatsoever when she moved the ship.</p>

  <p>Even the Eternal Realm warriors couldn't track her. It was unimaginable that Divine Farmer was still able to do so.</p>

  <p>"Keep moving!"</p>

  <p>Before she could even finish calling out, the Invisible Ship disappeared once again.</p>

  <p>But just as it moved, Divine Farmer managed to catch up, closing the distance between him and the ship.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Black Ship people couldn't remain composed.</p>

  <p>"How did he find us?"</p>

  <p>"Look, he's coming again!"</p>

  <p>"Was there any clue left on the red crystal?"</p>

  <p>They searched frantically for a clue, completely reluctant to fight against Divine Farmer directly.</p>

  <p>"Would Usman have told him how to find the ship?" Shera asked.</p>

  <p>"It's possible..." Edith nodded, considering the thought.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, Usman easily found the ship with a unique ability.</p>

  <p>"That guy..." Even the brass man was deep in confusion, displeased.</p>

  <p>While Usman had troubled the Black Ship before, never did it occur to them that Usman would dare do it again after being reborn? he was a natural troublemaker.</p>

  <p>"What should we do? Should we find a way to kill Usman?" asked the "bamboo pole".</p>

  <p>"We can't kill him. Even Fuxi can't kill him, let alone any of us," Shera said regretfully, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Seeing Divine Farmer approach, Edith had no time to even speak. The moment she reached a place, she had to move away immediately. If she was even a second slower, the Invisible Ship would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Usman suffered greatly under such a case.</p>

  <p>Each time Divine Farmer checked the ship's location, Usman's eyes bulged and pulled him to a complete turn.</p>

  <p>Yet if he didn't cooperate, his neck would be completely twisted off.</p>

  <p>And so while people could see Usman constantly spinning in circles and cursing into the air, they had no clue what was happening to him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the sky above the Separate Amber Province, the Black Ship's captain stood atop his ship's bow.</p>

  <p>The edges of his black cloak were drenched in blood which seemed to be flowing somehow, heated up and emitting fine bubbles.</p>

  <p>The ship's surface was also badly charred.</p>

  <p>While there was no actual fire, the ship had been charred anyway, becoming suited to its name, Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Before the captain was the huge shadow of Snake Goddess floating in the air. It had already stretched out its arms to envelop the entire ship, along with the captain.</p>

  <p>And so the captain couldn't take action being directly confronted by the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, Divine Farmer has already attacked the Black Ship's members. With the strength of Divine Farmer, sooner or later, he'll be able to take Luo Zheng away. I don't think it's wise to fight me," the captain said.</p>

  <p>It was Divine Farmer and the Black Ship members that fought over Luo Zheng, after all.</p>

  <p>Regardless of who got the man, the result would be unacceptable to the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"The Black Ship members may be only a group of Holy Soul Realm warriors, but they are not ordinary ones. Not long ago, it took only four of them to stop the Thunder Dimorphodon. No matter how powerful Divine Farmer is, the outcome will not be determined in such a short period of time." The Snake Goddess was shaking her head, highly confident in her own judgment.</p>

  <p>"But what's the point of trapping me?" asked the captain again.</p>

  <p>"It will be meaningful once Fuxi wins," responded the Snake Goddess calmly.</p>

  <p>If Fuxi defeated Xuanyuan, he'd have enough time and energy to fight for Luo Zheng. Whether or not there were other variables involved, she had to act accordingly.</p>

  <p>In truth, at this point, the three forces were still testing each other? both the Snake Goddess and the captain were cautious, carefully trying to pick out each other's trump card.</p>
