<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The rest of the disciples followed suit and drank each of their own Sword-reading Liquid up.</p>

  <p>The Sword-reading Liquid the disciples from the Sword Light Palace had was much purer than that of the others. After they drank it, the aura exuded by the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent from their bodies became intense.</p>

  <p>Most of the disciples from the Sword Light Palace had not completely mastered the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent yet. However, after drinking the Sword-reading Liquid, they all felt their heads surge with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Moreover, they felt that their comprehension of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent had increased and even reached a higher level.</p>

  <p>Now, if there was a continuous supply of that specific Sword-reading Liquid, then everyone would be able to enter the Sea of Truth easily in a short span of time.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Zheng said lightly.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's command, all the disciples of the Sword Light Palace followed him as they headed directly to the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Zheng was only about a thousand feet away from their destination, he sensed something odd— a strong repulsive force was coming straight towards him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it was not only Zheng who felt it, but also everyone else in the group. This repulsive force even seemed to have slowed down their paces.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>But somehow, even with the strong repulsive force, Zheng quickly managed to adapt to it. By lightly twisting his body, his speed of moving forward returned back to normal.</p>

  <p>However, most of the other people still felt the force. They felt heaviness linger with their every step. On the other hand, the situation of the disciples from the Sword Light Palace was better because of their Sword-reading Liquid's good quality.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of people were approaching the Sword Wall at the same time. In fact, with that great amount of people bustling towards the Sword Wall, about 90% of them were slowed down by the force. However, there were a few disciples who were not much affected by the force and stood out, and Zheng was one of them.</p>

  <p>Behind him were two women walking together, while to his right, there was a young man who wore cotton clothes. Aside from Zheng, they, too, looked relaxed as if they didn't feel the pressure at all.</p>

  <p>'Humans are so powerful. Every day, tens of thousands of people flock as they try their best to cross the Sword Wall and join the formidable force.</p>

  <p>There will always be people who would stand out from the rest. Hmm...I wonder if these few people have also taken the Sword-reading Liquid, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>In fact, if Zheng kept walking with such a brisk pace, then he would be able to reach the Sword Wall, which was about a thousand feet from him, in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>However, when he was just a hundred feet away from the Sword Wall, the two women behind him slowed down as they could not bear the pressure any longer. On the other hand, the young man in cotton clothes still kept on moving forward and even kept up with Zheng's pace casually.</p>

  <p>When the young man saw Zheng looking at him, he greeted, "Hello..."</p>

  <p>Nodding, Zheng asked, "Hey, what's up?"</p>

  <p>"Have you taken the Sword-reading Liquid?" the young man asked curiously.</p>

  <p>As they walked, he noticed that Zheng was being effortless with his trek, and this made him feel quite strange about him.</p>

  <p>"No," Zheng replied shortly.</p>

  <p>The young man was taken aback by Zheng's answer. Surprised, he spoke, "It seems that you have a high level of compatibility with the swordsmanship."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng only gave him a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can also become a Flag Master if you want," the young man continued to evaluate Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master? What in the world is that?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, this reminded Zheng of something. He remembered that those young men in white he encountered before called the old man 'Flag Master'.</p>

  <p>Upon learning that Zheng did not have any idea about what the Flag Master was, the young man felt strange about him. He then proceeded to explain,</p>

  <p>"Anyone who crosses the Sword Wall has no freedom to do anything. In fact, they have to join a Flag Master. After you cross the Sword Wall, you will be left with two choices: either join a Flag Master or become one yourself."</p>

  <p>"Is that really the case?" All of a sudden, there was a flash in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"So, how can I become a Flag Master?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you should just hang your sword at the top, and that's it," the young man replied.</p>

  <p>The Sword Wall was known to have such a towering height and was divided into six layers.</p>

  <p>Zheng had noticed earlier that the Sword Wall had long swords covering it, but there were fewer swords at the top of the wall.</p>

  <p>"So, I just need to hang my sword at the top, right?" Zheng said as he nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng thought that he only needed to cross the Sword Wall. But now that the young man said something about the Flag Master, Zheng suddenly seemed to change his whole plan.</p>

  <p>He thought of the fellow named Galen, who swore to kill him once he crossed the Sword Wall. At that moment, Zheng realized that he didn't want to join any of the Flag Masters, but rather be one himself.</p>

  <p>When Zheng finished making up his mind, he had already reached the Sword Wall. Taking a deep breath, he felt like his entire body was a roc that spread its wings rapidly while climbing up!</p>

  <p>"Wow! That's an amazing speed..." Witnessing such a magnificent sight, the jaw of the young man in cotton clothes almost dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>He had been very proud of himself. Hailing from a large clan in the north of the Bloom Divine Province, the young man was 70% compatible with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. He thought that Zheng was weaker than him at first, but when he saw how Zheng flew at an amazing speed, he could not help but gasp in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Originally, the Oneness Sky Palace used the Sword Wall to distinguish the warriors from the general public, and not for selecting talents.</p>

  <p>Rationally, as Zheng flew higher, the more pressure he would feel from the Sword Wall. But since the pressure came from the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, it wasn't able to generate so much pressure on Zheng.</p>

  <p>And in just a blink of an eye, Zheng was already at the top of the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>"The s...speed..." the young man stammered as he couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a row of young men in white robes who stood on top of the Sword Wall. One of those men was Harden, who had threatened Zheng before.</p>

  <p>As he saw how Zheng easily flew onto the top of the Sword Wall, his eyebrows narrowed as a slight killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"So this guy wants to be a Flag Master, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Haha, as a person with no background but a desire to become a Flag Master, this guy is surely digging his own grave! It might be a bit difficult for us to kill him if he joins another Flag Master. But he's simply wishing for his own death by becoming a Flag Master himself!"</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>Although the Flag Masters were given more rights, they also had to bear more responsibilities, which were not at all enjoyable.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the majority of the people would often give up this idea and join other Flag Masters, except for those with a powerful background.</p>

  <p>"Enough!"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed as he reached the top of the Sword Wall. All of a sudden, he turned the long sword in his hand and slashed the wall.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, the long sword slammed hard onto the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>But the Sword Wall was like a huge magnet, which made the sword stick firmly to it.</p>

  <p>Turning over, Zheng stood and remained steady above the Sword Wall. At the same time, he looked down below.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the young man in cotton robes and the other two girls started to climb as well. Unfortunately, it seemed that all three of them were struggling so hard to reach the higher layers on the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>As for the others, they were no better for they performed even worse! In fact, most of them even found it difficult to take a single step forward after they managed to be three hundred feet away from the Sword Wall. But because of taking the Sword-reading Liquid, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace were able to perform better than the others.</p>

  <p>When Elgin and Beldene reached the Sword Wall, Faegan and the other disciples stayed very close behind them. Even Kenelm was only about eighty feet away from the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>Zheng heaved a long sigh of relief upon seeing this. At that moment, he expected that the disciples of the Sword Light Palace would all pass.</p>

  <p>Expecting a great turnout, he even wondered what Laura would feel if she saw this.</p>

  <p>Turning his head to the other side of the Sword Wall, Zheng saw a large open space behind it. There, hundreds of people were gathered, all of whom were masters at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Based on the aura that they were emitting, it indicated that they had reached the Other Shore Realm not too long ago.</p>

  <p>Each of them held a metal flagpole in their hands with flags that had different surnames written on each of them. They all stood there proudly as the flags spread out in the wind.</p>

  <p>"Yao!"</p>

  <p>"Chen!"</p>

  <p>"Mu!" Zheng read some of the surnames he saw that were written on the flags.</p>

  <p>'So are these people the so-called Flag Masters?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Just as the young man in cotton had mentioned, right after a person crossed the Sword Wall, they were required to join a Flag Master. Thinking about this, Zheng said to himself, "So this is what the young man meant. Are these Flag Masters here to recruit new members?"</p>
