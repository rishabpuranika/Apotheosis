<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3667 The Dragon Cliff </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Bloom Divine Province was the base of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>With the invasion of the Jin Wu, Pearce chose to lead the soldiers to resist the enemy in the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>He just didn't want the Jin Wu to wreak havoc in the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>However, when the Jin Wu wantonly attacked, he didn't expect that the Bearing race would assign another force to advance from the southeast.</p>

  <p>The southeast of the Bloom Divine Province had always been uninhabited.</p>

  <p>From time to time, races from the savage land would attempt to launch attacks from there.</p>

  <p>Later, the Taiyi Heaven Palace set up a pass in the southeast of the Bloom Divine Province. There, on the Dragon Cliff, they set up the Bloody Sword Array.</p>

  <p>For hundreds of years, powerful Oneness Governors had guarded the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>Currently, the designated Oneness Governor was a man called Patton Lin.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Zheng, Patton also had a perfect matching with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. As a direct descendant of the Lin Clan in the Origin Mountain, he was treated with the same respect as Dorothy was. However, a dispute in the Taiyi Heaven Palace involving him had broken out two hundred years ago, which led to the death of his wife.</p>

  <p>Since then, he had volunteered to come to the Dragon Cliff. For the past two hundred years, he had been the one guarding the cliff.</p>

  <p>In his time there, the savage alien races from the southwest rarely dared to invade. The few who did dare ended up being brutally annihilated...</p>

  <p>Ever since the Jin Wu's invasion from the northeast, the Taiyi Heaven Palace had been in a state of panic. Even the soldiers on the Dragon Cliff had been worried and engaged in lively discussions.</p>

  <p>"This time, the Jin Wu has come with great power. I wonder if the seven mountains will be able to defeat them..."</p>

  <p>"They have to. They've retreated from the Mountain Viewing Province all the way to the North Unicorn Province. They must not let those birds get even the Bloom Divine Province!"</p>

  <p>"I have made an application to participate in the war in the North Unicorn Province, but I was rejected..."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing we can do about that. Fighting against the Jin Wu is very important, but guarding the Dragon Cliff is equally important. If we leave, what if the savage races seize this opportunity to stir up trouble?"</p>

  <p>As they discussed among themselves, a man in cyan flew towards them.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the man, all the soldiers stood up immediately and bowed towards him.</p>

  <p>"Sir, is there any news about the North Unicorn Province?"</p>

  <p>"Is our Taiyi Heaven Palace winning?"</p>

  <p>"Did they stop the Jin Wu in the North Unicorn Province?"</p>

  <p>The man in cyan robe was none other than the Oneness Governor Patton.</p>

  <p>Patton looked into the eyes of his soldiers. He could tell they were just as concerned about the war in the north as he was.</p>

  <p>However, it was difficult for news to be delivered across provinces. Even Patton found himself receiving delayed information through communication tokens.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I got the news that the battle is still going on. However, the specific situation is not clear."</p>

  <p>Their hearts sank.</p>

  <p>"Sir, it doesn't matter if the Dragon Cliff is guarded or not. Anyway, those savage alien races won't dare to enter the Bloom Divine Province!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. How about we go north?"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Patton's expression darkened. "Nonsense! We can't leave our post. Even if we do, how much help could you offer them, given your strength?"</p>

  <p>Although Patton was considered a rare talent in the Origin Mountain, his foundation was still shallow. He was probably a bit stronger than Li Bianxue, but he was nowhere near the level of Athemar, who was also the Oneness Governor.</p>

  <p>Even if he led these soldiers to battle, he doubted their presence would tip the scales in their favor.</p>

  <p>After being scolded by the Oneness Governor, these soldiers immediately shut up. They silently looked at the landscape in the distance.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, rays of red light burst out from the patterns in the front of the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>Patton and the others present frowned at the sight of the red light.</p>

  <p>"Speak of the devil. Those savage aliens really decided to pick a fight now!" a soldier said fiercely.</p>

  <p>Another soldier drew his sword. "Humph! And I just wanted to vent my anger. Perfect timing!"</p>

  <p>All of them were no strangers to slaughtering the savage aliens.</p>

  <p>Patton eyed the rays of red light in the distance warily. Instead of giving orders, he stood still, as though deep in thought. After a while, he finally said in a low voice, "Things are not good..."</p>

  <p>"Sir, what's wrong?" a burly soldier with a huge sword resting on his shoulder asked.</p>

  <p>Normally, Patton would resolutely start giving orders at this point. How come he was so hesitant today? He couldn't imagine Patton being scared.</p>

  <p>After all, he was their fearless leader.</p>

  <p>Patton pointed at the rays of red light. "The Bone Array, the Dream Array, and the Spiritual Array have been forcefully destroyed. But what about the Secret Array, the Picture Array, and the Darkness Array?"</p>

  <p>Then, the others also sensed that something was amiss. As they kept their eyes glued to the red light, their expressions grew grave.</p>

  <p>The Bone Array, the Dream Array and the Spiritual Array were arranged behind the other three arrays: the Secret Array, the Picture Array and the Darkness Array. Since the former three arrays had been destroyed, the latter three ones should have been in worse shape. However, they couldn't determine the condition of these three arrays now.</p>

  <p>This probably meant that the Secret Array, the Picture Array and the Darkness Array had been cracked...</p>

  <p>Those savage aliens had all sorts of powerful talents, but their intelligence was generally inferior to that of humans. How could they possibly crack such intricate arrays?</p>

  <p>The red light meant something-- that there were extremely powerful array breakers among the intruders.</p>

  <p>This ultimately meant these intruders were not savage aliens!</p>

  <p>In the currently delicate situation, they needed to be on high alert for any tiny change!</p>

  <p>"Activate the Bloody Sword Array," Patton finally ordered.</p>

  <p>The Bloody Sword Array was the greatest sword array on the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>It had only been activated three times since the Dragon Cliff was built, not long after the Taiyi Heaven Palace was established. Since Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself eliminated the three major savage alien races, the Bloody Sword Array had never been activated again.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Streaks of blood-red light flashed around the entire Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>The huge cliff resembled a giant dragon stretching its neck to look at the sky. With the Bloody Sword Array activated, it was as though the dragon was coming to life.</p>

  <p>An immense aura soared into the sky, flowing forth from the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>Patton stood atop it, gravely surveying the scene before him.</p>

  <p>As he expected, several figures soon appeared around thirty thousand feet away from the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>Seeing those people clearly, Patton shut his eyes tightly and took a deep breath. A strong sense of frustration came to him.</p>

  <p>He figured that the people in the distance were either from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race. If this was so, it'd be impossible for his soldiers to defend the Dragon Cliff.</p>

  <p>"Everyone," he addressed his soldiers loudly, "get into the transmission array and return to the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Now!"</p>

  <p>At the sight of the enemy, the soldiers gasped in horror. However, despite their initial fear, they still felt there was a chance they could fight their enemy.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Patton's orders, everyone was stunned for a moment. When they finally came back to their senses, they broke into an uproar.</p>

  <p>"I won't leave!"</p>

  <p>"You can leave if you want. But I am staying to fight!"</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to guard the Dragon Cliff, if it's the last thing I do!"</p>
