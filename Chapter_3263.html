<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The guy from the Oneness Sky Palace is so powerful..."</p>

  <p>"He single-handedly dealt with a group of warriors from the Bearing race!"</p>

  <p>"If I were him, I probably would run away."</p>

  <p>The warriors from other races discussed among themselves while stealing glances at the scene.</p>

  <p>The nine members of the Snake Goddess race stood quietly observing from afar.</p>

  <p>"The Bearing race are trying to kill the members of the Oneness Sky Palace, should we make a move?" A clear voice reverberated in the ears of the other members.</p>

  <p>"No... Don't forget our purpose," another woman said while shaking her head in disapproval.</p>

  <p>If the Source World was divided into three large groups, the Snake Goddess race and the Oneness Sky Palace belonged to the same one. However, the alliance between them wasn't out in the open yet. The Snake Goddess race preferred not to cause too much trouble, so they chose to stand by and watch.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Chaim continued his attempts to retreat.</p>

  <p>After he successfully launched a sneak attack, the eight swords under his manipulation were scattered in all directions after breaking down in many pieces. At the same time, some of those pieces bore the weight of Chaim, retreating from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! He did it again!"</p>

  <p>"Keep your eyes on the pieces!"</p>

  <p>"What if he returns to the Other Shore? The pieces are hard to deal with!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race felt helpless and gnashed their teeth in frustration.</p>

  <p>This time, Chaim had broken down the eight swords and spread them around the area.</p>

  <p>If the Bearing race wished to go after him, they would have to be on a constant lookout for the location of those pieces at any given moment. This way, the warriors would be restricted from moving at will.</p>

  <p>"Nobody has ever dared to fool me like this!"</p>

  <p>From Haider's point of view, Chaim's attacks were equivalent to cheap little tricks.</p>

  <p>He completely disregarded the debris lying around and charged towards the direction where Chaim had left.</p>

  <p>Haider stretched out his hand while in pursuit. A sharp streak of purple flashed in his hand. Shortly after, a thin blade appeared as he clenched it tightly.</p>

  <p>He wanted to wait here for Chaim to return to the Other Shore so he could kill him!</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace escaped with Feng Ge under their protection. The other races kept a close watch on the movements of the Bearing race. While the rest of the disciples from the Bearing race stood in place, Haider waited in silence with full attention.</p>

  <p>Three seconds passed...</p>

  <p>Nine seconds...</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds...</p>

  <p>"Come out! You bastard!"</p>

  <p>Haider shouted on top of his lungs in frustration, his veins protruding from his neck.</p>

  <p>It was slowly becoming apparent that Chaim might not return to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Oneness Sky Palace...</p>

  <p>On a distinct mountain somewhere, Chaim sat in the center of a hall with his legs crossed. He let his long luscious hair hang loosely over his back.</p>

  <p>His mustache was rugged and uneven, covering most of his face, and his robe was covered in filth, giving him an overall messy appearance.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be in a pleasant mood as he smiled to himself softly.</p>

  <p>The man beside Chaim slowly opened his eyes suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Is he still there?" Chaim inquired.</p>

  <p>The man shrugged and answered, "Yes. Don't go back in there now. He is yelling like some crazy man. I'm afraid, if you get in right away, he'll kill you."</p>

  <p>"Alright then, I'll stay here and wait for your news." Chaim patted on the man's shoulder. The man nodded and closed his eyes to focus. Aura of the Truth of Godly Way began to spread out from his body, and then he returned to the Other Shore to investigate the scene.</p>

  <p>The same method had a miraculous effect for the first time, but if used a second time, the result might be bad. Although Haider was reckless, he was not a fool. He was well aware of the fact that Chaim would not return to the Other Shore so soon.</p>

  <p>Chaim had asked the man to hide himself in the crowd before the conflict broke out. The Bearing race wouldn't know he was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The man made several rounds in and out of the Other Shore to spy on the situation. Even though his movements were suspicious, no one would direct their attention to him.</p>

  <p>Finally, realizing it was useless to just stand and wait there, Haider decided to make his move.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?</p>

  <p>Go and get that woman back for me!"</p>

  <p>With a roar, Haider began to chase after the disciples. He turned all his focus towards capturing Feng Ge. As long as he caught her, any tricks Chaim was planning on playing with them would be rendered meaningless.</p>

  <p>When the other members of the Bearing race were convinced Chaim would not be returning so soon, they activated their soul force and followed closely behind Haider.</p>

  <p>Just as Haider left to go after Feng Ge, the man left the Other Shore once more.</p>

  <p>After the man gave Chaim the news, he immediately set out to return to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Just as he entered, the broken swords' pieces also emerged one by one.</p>

  <p>"Phew! Phew! Phew..."</p>

  <p>Once again, all the bits made their way to attack the Souls of Light of the members of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>However, they were not going to be fooled by the same trick twice. They were prepared this time. As a result, Chaim's attacks fell short of being effective. Only three warriors were harmed, and the damage caused by the debris was not severe.</p>

  <p>The attacks caused Haider to stop in his tracks. He heaved a sigh of relief as turning around. "You're smart, but not enough. As long as your weakness is out in the open, you will never be able to turn the tables."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Chaim asked, suddenly baffled by the calmness in Haider's voice. Yet, Chaim remained focused and restored the broken swords.</p>

  <p>"Let me see how you manage to get out of the Other Shore this time."</p>

  <p>Haider gloated as a smirk appeared on his face. His demeanor gave off the impression as if Chaim had walked right into a carefully constructed trap like a sacrificial lamb.</p>

  <p>"Look at his feet!"</p>

  <p>"Haider has set up the Soul Binding Thread on his feet!"</p>

  <p>"It appears his luck has run out."</p>

  <p>Overhearing the discussion of the other races, Chaim lowered his gaze to his feet subconsciously.</p>

  <p>There was a Soul Binding Thread wrapped around his feet to restrict his movements. Just as he returned to the Other Shore, the Soul Binding Thread was bound to his feet.</p>

  <p>A weak smile appeared on Chaim's face. It seemed the man he had sent to check on the situation had left this detail out of his report. 'That boy still has a ways to go yet...' Chaim shook his head in visible disappointment.</p>

  <p>Of course, Haider wouldn't allow Chaim enough time to think of a strategy or counterattack. After he walked a few steps slowly, he leaped up in the air and dashed towards Chaim with an intent to kill, while the members of the Bearing race followed close behind.</p>

  <p>As for the members from the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race, although they didn't make a move, they were still blocking Chaim from behind with their murderous eyes.</p>

  <p>Chaim had nowhere to go now, and he was unable to retreat from the Other Shore. He was like an insect, trapped in a spider's web, counting the time before death consumed him.</p>

  <p>Even in the face of such an intense situation, he kept himself composed.</p>

  <p>Tenacious as he was, he refused to give up. The eight long swords flew around him and vigorously fought back a fraction of the Bearing race members.</p>

  <p>However, Haider moved past all the long swords and swiftly made his way to strike Chaim with his slender blade.</p>

  <p>Chaim's hands were occupied as they'd changed into swords. Without his arms, how could he be able to fight off someone as powerful as Haider?</p>

  <p>He could only use his feet to dodge and retreat.</p>

  <p>Observing his movements, Haider finally caught up to him and used the opportunity. The thin blade in his hand suddenly emitted a blood-red light and attempted to chop down Chaim's head.</p>

  <p>Although Chaim was unaware of what the blood light contained in the thin blade was, he did know if he got cut by it, his Soul of Light would get destroyed.</p>

  <p>Some of the other races spectating from afar sympathized with Chaim.</p>

  <p>They had already predicted his tragic fate in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a sharp light shot towards Haider's thin blade.</p>

  <p>"Ding!"</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, a small soul sword circled in the air and made its way back to the chest of a human girl.</p>

  <p>It was Dorothy who swung the soul sword to protect Chaim.</p>

  <p>After Jermain had left the Other Shore, he had told Winchell what she was about to do and caused a lot of trouble for her.</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing that could change her mind to return to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect to see the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace fighting against the Bearing race as soon as she entered the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Watching Chaim's life hanging by a thread as he was faced by a ruthless Haider, how could she hold back? Finally, she decided to make her move.</p>
