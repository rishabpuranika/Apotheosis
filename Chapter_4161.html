<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Placing their coordinates in the body of the metal-devouring beast was a big risk for the Snake Masters. These coordinates were, after all, their lifelines.</p>

  <p>But Arthur wasn't careful to check himself after swallowing the metal-devouring beast, which gave the two Snake Masters a chance.</p>

  <p>At Derrick's warning, Arthur began to look inside his belly, holding it with both hands, trying to look for the two sets of coordinates within his body.</p>

  <p>"Master, how's it going on the outside?" Dale asked the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been lost in thought, but Dale's question shook him out of his reverie.</p>

  <p>"It's coming," he said seriously.</p>

  <p>"What is coming?" asked Dale.</p>

  <p>"The biggest trouble," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord replied.</p>

  <p>The fact that the two Snake Masters had appeared in the bubble was causing them the most trouble. Their appearance meant that the bubble's location had already been exposed to the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, trying to control the bubble and move it underground, had sensed that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"The biggest trouble?" Dale said, the corners of his eyes twitching.</p>

  <p>This cat and mouse game had gone on in the Jade Pure Realm for many years and had now finally come to an end.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Arthur was still searching for the coordinates in his stomach, a space so large that it had formed a world of its own. It was difficult for any creature to get out of his stomach alive, the only exceptions being the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>But before he could find the coordinates, he heard a muffled sound from above his head. The bubble had cracked open. Sewell and more than ten Snake Masters were making their way in through the crack.</p>

  <p>Dale, Derrick, Arthur, and Justin had pumped up, brimming with fighting spirit. They had been of the opinion that as long as they properly handled everything, they could still survive in the bubble.</p>

  <p>But their hearts sank at the sight of the Snake Masters.</p>

  <p>"Go inside!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shouted at them.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Yellow Tower was emitting a strong gravitational force, sucking the four disciples into it.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had his hands pressed together and continually changed his movements. A faint yellow light appeared on the surface of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, causing it to look like an endless amount of power was accumulating on it.</p>

  <p>Sewell coiled in the air, looking down upon the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord below him. His lips were curled in a mocking sneer as he said,</p>

  <p>"Don't even try to fight back. It won't be of any use."</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord smiled as he said calmly, "I don't think so."</p>

  <p>"Letting you go caused me some small troubles. But what's the point of reviving the Monkey Spirit King? The real end is not in this Other Shore,"</p>

  <p>Sewell said.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization reported everything important to Sewell, who then sifted through it and reported the most important information of the lot to the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Sewell knew way more than the Snake Spirit King did.</p>

  <p>He could guess that these people were probably the reason why the humans had been able to make rapid progress and even awaken the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord laughed, every wrinkle on his face trembling. "Do you think you know the real end? Even Cornelius doesn't!</p>

  <p>He is stupid."</p>

  <p>Sewell sneered and said, "You've been underground for far too long. It looks like you're so scared that you've begun to talk nonsense."</p>

  <p>According to the Snake Masters, Cornelius was a wise king.</p>

  <p>Right from the internal strife in the Four Spirits Sect to the trap and to the present, he had meticulously planned every step. How could he be called stupid?</p>

  <p>"Cornelius, I know you're looking at us," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Sewell's eyes glinted coldly before sharp spines came shooting out of his body in quick succession. He didn't want this old human man to talk nonsense and offend the Snake Spirit King. How dare he call him by his name?</p>

  <p>Sewell was about to pounce on the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord when a voice sounded in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Let him continue."</p>

  <p>"But this old man? "</p>

  <p>"Calm down. I don't care."</p>

  <p>A truly powerful figure wouldn't care about the words of the weak.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King used the Limited Omnipotent Stone to explore everything in the bubble. And now, he wanted to hear what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord wanted to say.</p>

  <p>Sewell said to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, "My king allows you to continue."</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sneered and said, "The Four Spirits Sect has been deceived. You have all been deceived."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Sewell asked, as instructed by the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"The downgrading," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>Sewell's countenance became serious.</p>

  <p>He thought that the rats hiding underground had been able to survive for so many years only because they had accidentally obtained the bubble to protect them. What more could they know?</p>

  <p>"Go on," Sewell continued, his eyes narrowing.</p>

  <p>"The downgrading is irreversible," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>The other Snake Masters remained stoic because they didn't know what the downgrading meant.</p>

  <p>Sewell, on the other hand, was shaking.</p>

  <p>Cornelius had once told him the meaning of downgrading. The chaos and the other secondary worlds were extension of the main world.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect had been able to defeat the other three sects of the Four Spirits Sect because they had planned everything in advance in the chaos, obtained an advantage in the downgraded world, and as a result, won the battle.</p>

  <p>Now, the Snake Spirit King's next step was to upgrade. All the members of the Snake Spirit Sect would return to the main world, where the Snake Spirit Sect would rule.</p>

  <p>"You are just a creature from the secondary world. You can't even take a single step in the main world, but you dare talk a lot of nonsense! Do you think I believe you?" Sewell sneered again.</p>

  <p>"This fraud began when you planted the first Holy Stone and the first holy pillar began to grow. Did any of the secondary worlds you mentioned collapse? Were any of them restored to the main world? Even if the secondary worlds were destroyed completely, they would still exist. Am I right?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord continued.</p>

  <p>He had never been to the main world, but had a clear understanding of everything through Elder Xue's dream.</p>

  <p>Sewell hesitated yet again, and this time, so did the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Four Spirits Sect had built many secondary worlds, a number of which had collapsed. These worlds had been defective, but once they had been built, they would not disappear and would remain there forever.</p>

  <p>However, the main world was large. Who would care about these small caves?</p>

  <p>"They gave you the power to lead you to destruction. Someone from the Bold Conjecture House of the Human Spirit Sect had discovered this, but he was killed before he could send out this news. You, the Snake Spirit Sect, are the stupidest for being willing to be their lackeys!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, his voice rising.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had aimed for the completion of the Finale Way. But after he had entered Elder Xue's dream, he discovered that the chaos was much more complicated than he had imagined, and that they needed more than the Finale Way.</p>
