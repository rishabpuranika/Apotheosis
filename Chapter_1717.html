<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1717 The Instant Godly Tile </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The piece of crystal was a cross with sharp edges.</p>

  <p>Its entire body was suffused with an illusory blue light, as if it were a ten thousand-year-old block of mysterious ice.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng looked into his inner world, he would see the crystal float in the air within it, partly hidden and partly visible.</p>

  <p>It twinkled like a star, disappearing and reappearing again in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Mu Ning that Luo Luo Zheng exuded acted the same way.</p>

  <p>In that instant, he was like a True God who had descended into this world.</p>

  <p>However, in the next moment itself, the Mu Ning disappeared without a single trace.</p>

  <p>The scene was very strange.</p>

  <p>So much so that Tianming did not dare step forward in haste. It would be a rash move on his part.</p>

  <p>The strength of that Mu Ning made Luo Luo Zheng seem as if he were the eye of a storm.</p>

  <p>If Tianming were to step within a thousand feet of that Mu Ning, he would probably be crushed by it.</p>

  <p>Even from thousands of feet away, Tianming's heart throbbed incessantly, as if he were in the Land of Extreme Chillness. At the same time, he felt as if he were at the bottom of the deep sea. The ginormous pressure made him unable to breathe.</p>

  <p>A wave of his Soaring Snake Sword had it thrust into the board as he stood behind the blade.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A sharp light spread out, accompanied by many ripples.</p>

  <p>Tianming felt a bit better using the Soaring Snake Sword to resist Luo Zheng's Mu Ning. When he looked at Luo Luo Zheng, a strange expression entered his eyes, along with a trace of helplessness.</p>

  <p>"I know you're not weak, but you shouldn't be so strong either," he murmured.</p>

  <p>To Tianming, Luo Zheng's Mu Ning seemed ridiculously strong.</p>

  <p>In addition to Tianming, the few Godly Geniuses who hovered on top of the stones also looked distinctly uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Even though the spaces above the stones were protected by laws, Luo Zheng's Mu Ning still brought forth a strong sense of oppression to them.</p>

  <p>This oppression was not intentional.</p>

  <p>It was like a lion had appeared amidst a horde of beasts. Even if the lion remained silent, it proved to be a great deterrent to the surrounding wild beasts.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Luo Luo Zheng himself was clueless.</p>

  <p>Just now, he had been pushed to the limits by Tianming.</p>

  <p>Even his chaotic energy was depleted.</p>

  <p>His Emotion Closing Divine Dao was not perfect. Losing to Tianming had been unavoidable.</p>

  <p>However, just as he had been about to lose, a special understanding had manifested itself in Luo Zheng's mind, as if someone had placed a line of thought from outside.</p>

  <p>It existed even now, appearing in an instant and disappearing in another.</p>

  <p>It was as if someone was inside his inner world, breathing in and out at great speed.</p>

  <p>Glancing into his body, Luo Luo Zheng could see a bright blue light at the center of his inner world. He saw the flickering crystal there.</p>

  <p>A portion of chaotic energy flowed to the bottom of the crystal, forming a circular wheel in the shape of the Eight Diagrams as it supported the crystal.</p>

  <p>"What is this thing?</p>

  <p>Why would the chaotic energy be attracted to this crystal and turn into this shape?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng attempted to control the small portion of the chaotic energy, but realized that he could not do so.</p>

  <p>"What happened to you?" asked the broken sword in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The sword too had its pride. It was not willing to be driven by anyone other than Lone.</p>

  <p>Even if Lone had only lent it to Luo Luo Zheng because he wished for it to borrow Luo Zheng's strength to repair itself, the sword had never bothered exchanging a single word with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, it could not take it anymore.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, the sword had a strange feeling.</p>

  <p>It felt as if Luo Luo Zheng had become a True God.</p>

  <p>The sensation was absurd and unbelievable, but it was also real.</p>

  <p>It was like the bright red sun in the sky suddenly turned blue one day. If the sun turned that color, no one would be able to believe it. However, it would be there to see in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>The feeling that Luo Luo Zheng gave the others was as if they had all accidentally stepped into an unbelievable illusion.</p>

  <p>How could he be so powerful?</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl at the top of the clouds stared at Luo Luo Zheng in a daze.</p>

  <p>She had been in charge of the heavens for six grand eras.</p>

  <p>She knew that a world of chaos presented itself in every grand era.</p>

  <p>When the world of chaos arrived, the super talents appeared one after another like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. However, in the previous few rounds of the Illusion Battlefield, the final showdown had not witnessed many accidents.</p>

  <p>"It's the power of a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>He has achieved the Instant Godly Tile! It's unbelievable!</p>

  <p>This phenomenon is rare, even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>He doesn't have a Godly Plate. How can he store the Instant Godly Tile?" she murmured to herself.</p>

  <p>A Godly Tile was not an isolated existence.</p>

  <p>If no Godly Plate existed to store the Godly Tile, the latter could cause an explosion in the inner world.</p>

  <p>This was not the first time that she had been doubtful. However, she was completely unable to understand what was going on. A series of questions rose in her mind.</p>

  <p>It was indeed possible for someone to activate the Instant Godly Tile before stepping into the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>This kind of Godly Tile was not a real one. It was one that descended only once. Being extremely unstable, it appeared in an instant and then disappeared in another.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, Luo Luo Zheng was a True God at this moment.</p>

  <p>The people within the painting of the Illusion Battlefield could sense Luo Zheng's Mu Ning and transformation, but the numerous warriors outside the painting could not see it.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Why did Tianming retreat? He ran so far away from Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Why does Luo Luo Zheng suddenly seem so strong? I bet all my money on Tianming!"</p>

  <p>The warriors could not comprehend why Tianming, who had previously been as vicious as a tiger, suddenly fled.</p>

  <p>Even some of the Supreme Lords could not understand what had happened in the painting.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, rather liked this feeling.</p>

  <p>He could sense the unprecedented power that the blue crystal emanated.</p>

  <p>Countless cultivation methods existed in this universe, but they were all the same to him. When used, they gave him a strong sense of familiarity.</p>

  <p>However, the power in this crystal was different. It was rather strange and ominous.</p>

  <p>He could not tell what rules were contained within it, and he did not know what kind of characteristics this power possessed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only knew that this power was strong. Very strong!</p>

  <p>"How do I use this power?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an idea occurred to him.</p>

  <p>He extracted a stream of chaotic energy and drilled this strand into the circular wheel in the middle of his inner world. Passing through the circular wheel, it once again entered the cross-shaped crystal.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After passing through the crystal, the originally grayish-brown chaotic energy was coated in blue light.</p>

  <p>Just as this strand of chaotic energy left Luo Zheng's inner world and began to spread toward his chest, an invisible layer of frost left his body, covering the entire Heaven Earth Board with it.</p>

  <p>Stones, the board, the Soaring Snake Sword, and Tianming were all instantly covered in a thin layer of ice.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his shoulders as his body trembled.</p>

  <p>The thin layer of ice on his body instantly split open and slid down to the board, smashing to the board and transforming into a number of exquisite flowers.</p>

  <p>The ice posed no threat to Tianming, but the Mu Ning that escaped Luo Zheng's body could clearly freeze the world. Luo Zheng's change was very intimidating.</p>

  <p>"It's the power of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>You've been cultivating the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, but you activated the internal momentum of the Ice Mirror Divine Dao simultaneously. What happened to you, Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Tianming whispered. He could not figure this out for he did not know enough about the divine land. All his knowledge came from the records of the treasure trove of the Lord of Weapons.</p>

  <p>So how could he tell that Luo Luo Zheng had activated the Instant Godly Tile?</p>

  <p>The Instant Godly Tile only lasted for a moment.</p>

  <p>It was true that some True Gods in the divine land could experience such unexpected events. They would originally possess a Godly Tile, but in a short period of time, another Godly Tile would appear. The newly manifested Godly Tile could even take over the Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>But there existed a prerequisite for the Instant Godly Tile to appear, and that was for the person to possess a Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>If the Instant Godly Tile were to appear in a warrior's inner world without a Godly Plate, its only outcome would be for the inner world to explode straightaway. This meant that the elixir field would shatter. A warrior would then become an ordinary, useless individual.</p>

  <p>But when the Instant Godly Tile appeared in Luo Zheng's case, a portion of the chaotic energy within him transformed into a Godly Plate to store the tile.</p>

  <p>Until now, not a single person in the divine land knew why the Instant Godly Tile had appeared in that instant.</p>

  <p>For True Gods, the Instant Godly Tile was not of much use. After all, each one of them already possessed a Godly Tile, and the Divine Dao that they pursued were completely different.</p>

  <p>But for Luo Luo Zheng, it had been rather useful.</p>

  <p>He brandished the sword in his hand again. The internal momentum of the Ice Mirror Divine Dao transferred over an icy blue light to the broken sword. The cold energy that lingered around Luo Zheng's body changed to an ice lotus flower that gradually unfolded its petals.</p>

  <p>A wisp of sword intent had already condensed itself into a form.</p>
