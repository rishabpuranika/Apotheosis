<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4129 The Black Phoenix Candle </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A stream of blood-like substance flowed down from the top of the Li Shan mountain just like a bloody waterfall.</p>

  <p>If one observed carefully, they would see that this "bloody waterfall" was actually a stream of pure energy.</p>

  <p>It flowed halfway down the mountain, thus dying the entire upper half of the mountain red.</p>

  <p>This was naturally a shocking sight for both the leaders and the disciples of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"If I'm not mistaken, this is the bloodline token of the Snake Goddess."</p>

  <p>"It's very similar to the aura the shadow of Snake Goddess has."</p>

  <p>"But this is purer and stronger than that."</p>

  <p>After the Snake Goddess reached the Eternal Realm, her strength could be said to have reached its peak.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, she had changed her Other Shore Tokens to better ones, but her strength never really made any progress.</p>

  <p>Because of that, the power her shadow currently showed naturally amazed everyone. It was obvious to them that she had gained a lot on the Other Shore this time.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The bloody waterfall suddenly converged, forming a huge shadow of Snake Goddess that floated above the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A split second later, the Snake Goddess on the jadeite platform had soared to the sky.</p>

  <p>When she hovered in the air, the strong air current blew her hair upright.</p>

  <p>Her gaze was extremely solemn.</p>

  <p>Upon mastering the Blood-controlling Method, the Snake Goddess had been itching to give it a try.</p>

  <p>Therefore, despite this being her first day returning to the Li Shan mountain, she already went all out in using her bloodline token.</p>

  <p>"Kendrick, are you ready?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A formidable force surged out of the inside of the Li Shan mountain. This force was the power of truth.</p>

  <p>The moment the power of truth gushed out of the Li Shan mountain, a layer of cyan-colored shell suddenly enveloped the entire mountain.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was about the size of a large province. One could only imagine the size of this shell.</p>

  <p>"You can begin." Kendrick's voice came from inside the mountain.</p>

  <p>Kendrick didn't participate in the battle of the Li Shan mountain before because the battle was already over when he arrived.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, after he went into the mountain, he still deployed his strongest defense moves to protect the mountain.</p>

  <p>Since the Snake Goddess wanted to test her strength, they decided to let her strength go against Kendrick's shell and see how it went.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" the Snake Goddess shouted. Her eyes were burning with excitement.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The huge shadow began to transform.</p>

  <p>Countless crimson energy particles solidified into one, forming something that looked like a huge rose floating in the sky.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>The energy particles suddenly converged at the root of the rose.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterward, the huge rose crashed downward following the Snake Goddess's violent hand gesture.</p>

  <p>"It's so scary!"</p>

  <p>"So powerful!"</p>

  <p>"Will the Snake Goddess destroy the Li Shan mountain?"</p>

  <p>As the creatures in the Li Shan mountain saw this scene, worry and fear crept into their gazes.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. The enchanted barrier above us is formed by the power of truth. No matter how powerful the Snake Goddess is, she won't necessarily be able to defeat the Chaos Ancient God."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The rose formed by the shadow of Snake Goddess pierced the shell but couldn't get through.</p>

  <p>However, energy particles continued to gather at the point where the rose pierced the shell. Along with the movement of the energy particles, the rose continued to drill madly into the turtle shell.</p>

  <p>A sharp, shrill noise echoed in the sky. It made some flying birds erratic as if they were drunk.</p>

  <p>The people of the Li Shan mountain were protected by the shell, so they weren't hurt by the noise, though it still made many people uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, your power can't penetrate through my shell," Kendrick remarked.</p>

  <p>The air current became even fiercer, and the Snake Goddess's long hair also fluttered even more wildly.</p>

  <p>Energy beams shot up to the sky and converged at high speed.</p>

  <p>She was pushing the power of her bloodline to the limit.</p>

  <p>Her shadow, which was originally crimson, had now turned deep purple.</p>

  <p>A destructive aura was constantly released from her shadow.</p>

  <p>According to the information in the Blood-controlling Method, the shadow of Snake Goddess itself had tremendous destructive power, and pushing it to the limit would trigger the Black Phoenix Candle.</p>

  <p>"Let me look!</p>

  <p>I want to feel the power of the Black Phoenix Candle!</p>

  <p>Show it to me!" the Snake Goddess roared.</p>

  <p>Every inch of her muscles was taut, and her slender body was brimming with power.</p>

  <p>After the last trace of purple color in her shadow faded, her shadow suddenly shattered and materialized again into a black flame.</p>

  <p>It seemed to contain an immeasurable destructive aura.</p>

  <p>"This is the Black Phoenix Candle!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A black phoenix flew down from behind the Snake Goddess and drilled into the shell.</p>

  <p>Cracks appeared on the surface of the originally hard shell.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier that Kendrick created was one whole entity.</p>

  <p>If one part couldn't be broken, the whole enchanted barrier wouldn't be broken.</p>

  <p>If one part was broken, the whole enchanted barrier would also be broken.</p>

  <p>The cracks spread all over at an incredible speed. Before long, the shell shattered with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>The moment the cyan-colored turtle shell broke, dragon scales appeared and covered the Li Shan mountain. This was the second enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Kendrick had set up three layers of defense on the Li Shan mountain. After the turtle shell, which was his outermost layer of defense, was broken, the second layer of defense would replace it. This layer of defense was known as the Dragon Scale Defense.</p>

  <p>"Good job. You've done very well by breaking my turtle shell. However, you should stop now? you can't break the Dragon Scale Defense," said Kendrick.</p>

  <p>They were just sparring with each other, and he didn't want to consume too much power of truth.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Goddess didn't reply. It was as if she didn't hear what he said. She just continued to force the Black Phoenix Candle to drill through the defense.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Dragon Scale Defense was much stronger than the turtle shell.</p>

  <p>But under the erosion of the Black Phoenix Candle, there was a faint sign of breaking.</p>

  <p>The increasing energy of the Black Phoenix Candle made Kendrick a little flustered. "That's enough, Snake Goddess. This is just a spar!"</p>

  <p>But the Snake Goddess seemed to have not heard of what he said.</p>

  <p>Her eyes became dark as if she was out of control.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The Dragon Scale Defense was broken.</p>

  <p>The third enchanted barrier quickly appeared over the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>It was a layer of ancient grey shell? Kendrick's shell.</p>

  <p>"Stop! Stop the Snake Goddess! Anyone! If this goes on, both of us will only suffer!"</p>

  <p>Kendrick surely had the means to counterattack the Snake Goddess. His shell could bounce back most of the Black Phoenix Candle's power.</p>

  <p>But if he did so, the Snake Goddess would most likely be killed in an instant, and he naturally didn't want to see that.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a figure quietly appeared beside the Snake Goddess. It was Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't even turn to look at Fuxi. She just waved her hand, sending the turbulent black flame towards him.</p>

  <p>The expression on Fuxi's face didn't change much. He opened and closed his arms, forming an invisible Eight Diagrams circle on his palms.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A strange scene appeared in front of everyone. The destructive flame revolved along the Eight Diagrams circle in Fuxi's hands like an obedient child.</p>

  <p>It was obviously unwilling to be imprisoned inside the Eight Diagrams circle, but it couldn't break out of the cycle no matter how hard it tried.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi put his hand on the Snake Goddess's shoulder, she trembled slightly and came to her senses. A second later, however, she fainted into Fuxi's arms as she had exhausted all her power.</p>

  <p>Fuxi calmly took her back to the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, and Ying looked at the Snake Goddess with dread.</p>

  <p>That the Blood-controlling Method could greatly improve the strength of cultivators at the Eternal Realm was already known by them, but they never expected that the Snake Goddess would make such progress that she could fight against the Chaos Ancient God head-on.</p>
