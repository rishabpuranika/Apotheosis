  <p>
</p>

  <p>Rosie stared at Samuel's face, not knowing what he meant.</p>

  <p>Just then, Pascal rose slowly and came over to stand next to Samuel.</p>

  <p>That was when Rosie began to feel the space around her turning. After a moment, she had arrived at the gate of the Abyss Demon Region with Pascal and Samuel.</p>

  <p>The gate was a complete mess, and all the transmission arrays had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>The only thing that remained was the barrier set together by the many powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The barrier was too solid and powerful for ordinary True Gods and even Demi-holy Beings to remove. However...</p>

  <p>Pascal raised his hand slightly, and a torrent of power surged out of thin air before it charged toward the barrier.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The barrier instantly disintegrated and the gate to the Abyss Demon Region was passable now.</p>

  <p>"Let me show you how naive you are!"</p>

  <p>Samuel said as he strode toward the gate.</p>

  <p>After a cold glance at Rosie, Pascal ordered, "Follow us."</p>

  <p>Much as she was eager to leave this place, as a ferocious beast, Rosie couldn't disobey Pascal, so she merely followed him toward the gate.</p>

  <p>She was sure that the moment she stepped into the divine land, she would perish and then resurrect in the black waters.</p>

  <p>As she was walking to the exit, however, a black light shot out from Pascal's ring.</p>

  <p>The moment the light hit her body, it latched onto her and penetrated deep inside.</p>

  <p>When she finally set foot in the divine land, she realized that she was still alive.</p>

  <p>"What?" she asked in amazement before stretching out her hands and looking down at her body with joy.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, before the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had entered the Abyss Demon Region and set up transmission arrays and the barrier, she had tried going back to the divine land.</p>

  <p>She still couldn't forget how, at that time, her body had immediately turned into ashes and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Since then, returning to the divine land had been like a dream for her. It had been so close and yet so far.</p>

  <p>She had never expected that now, years later, she would be able to return to the divine land, albeit in such a situation.</p>

  <p>Even if she had been brought here by Samuel as a hostage, she was so happy that she couldn't hide it. In a fit of joy, she spread her arms and spun around.</p>

  <p>Samuel gave her a cold look as he held out the Spear of Supreme Harmony, and an invisible spatial passageway enveloped the three of them. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared.</p>

  <p>Even when the power of the Spear of Supreme Harmony had been suppressed in the Abyss Demon Region, Samuel had still been able to use it to activate Grand Teleportation. Now, in the divine land, it had become even more powerful.</p>

  <p>With the Spear of Supreme Harmony, they could cross dozens of large regions every time.</p>

  <p>This way, they headed all the way north.</p>

  <p>Every time Rosie stepped out of the spatial passageway, she took a mental picture of the magnificent landscape she saw.</p>

  <p>Even the most desolate desert was a beautiful scenery in her eyes.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was a huge prison that was filled with the odor of sulfur. She had stayed there for far too long.</p>

  <p>"Why north?" she couldn't help asking after they had moved north several times through Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>"You'll know when we get there," said Samuel indifferently.</p>

  <p>Soon, the three of them finally arrived at the northernmost region— Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>Miles of land around the towering tree were barren because of the rolling deathly energy which surrounded it. Anything that the energy touched would be instantly annihilated.</p>

  <p>When the three of them stepped into the range of the deathly energy, a faint black circle of light appeared on their bodies. It was this circle of light that repelled the strong deathly energy and protected them.</p>

  <p>"Lofty Tree..."</p>

  <p>Rosie knew this place, but she didn't know why Samuel had brought her here.</p>

  <p>After walking toward the tree for a while, Samuel employed Grand Teleportation again and brought them to the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>Countless spiderwebs were hanging on the tree trunk, and there were four huge scarlet globes dangling inside them.</p>

  <p>As soon as Samuel showed up at the trunk, a majestic voice came out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you break in!"</p>

  <p>According to Nicholas's memory, Four Yellow Emperor Guards were confined inside the Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>Some of the Holy Beings had already known about this for some time, but none of them had dared to come to this place.</p>

  <p>Although the four Yellow Emperor Guards were sealed here, Hamish had already been released.</p>

  <p>It was by no means a wise thing to be targeted by an Other Shore Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>"I am Samuel Han," Samuel replied in a calm voice.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" one of the Yellow Emperor Guards asked.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas is dead," Samuel answered.</p>

  <p>Hamish was the one who had contacted the Holy Beings, but every once in a while, he would come back to report on the updates. What was more, it was the idea of the Yellow Emperor Guards to form the alliance of the powerful clans and unite the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"What? Nicholas is dead?" another Yellow Emperor Guard said coldly.</p>

  <p>"How did he die?"</p>

  <p>"I killed him," Samuel answered calmly.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! You killed our warrior and even came to provoke us? Do you really think we can do nothing to you?" The faces of all the Yellow Emperor Guards contorted in anger.</p>

  <p>"So, the alliance of the rich and powerful clans failed to conquer the Abyss Demon Region?" Another voice was heard. This one belonged to Leyton.</p>

  <p>Leyton didn't care about whether Nicholas was alive or dead. All he cared about was who was in charge of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>When Rosie heard his voice, her brows shot up in shock.</p>

  <p>This was a voice that she could never forget.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a total failure. Although the alliance has been completely destroyed, I'm in charge of the Abyss Demon Region now," Samuel replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Samuel said, the Yellow Emperor Guards all fell silent.</p>

  <p>"What are you here for?" Leyton asked slowly.</p>

  <p>"I know everything Nicholas knew. That's how I know about your existence. Since I control the Abyss Demon Region now, I want to replace him!" Samuel said.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Pascal stepped forward and pointed his ring at the globes.</p>

  <p>The ring emitted an indescribable power which the Yellow Emperor Guards were immediately attracted to.</p>

  <p>Samuel was very confident that he could get what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Although these guards had supported Nicholas, that didn't mean that they wouldn't abandon him.</p>

  <p>To them, a man like Samuel, who had control over the Abyss Demon Region, would obviously be more useful than Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"You are ambitious and powerful. Good." Leyton's faint voice was heard again.</p>

  <p>Just then, Rosie sneered, "Yeah, ambitious and powerful. So what? You are doomed to fail. In another three to five years, when our Nine Li Guards break into the divine land, you will all die!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Samuel barked. He hadn't anticipated that Rosie would speak.</p>

  <p>Pascal turned to her. His eyes twinkled, and then Rosie could not speak anymore.</p>

  <p>Leyton stared at Rosie in confusion for a long time before he realized who she was. "Ah, you were the little girl of the Nine Li race."</p>

  <p>To employ the Blood Splitting Technique to kill the whole Nine Li race, one had to use their blood. The purer the blood was, the better.</p>

  <p>That year, Leyton had slaughtered the whole Nine Li race with Rosie's blood.</p>

  <p>Years had passed since then. If Rosie hadn't spoken up now, he would not have recognized her. However, she had recognized his voice as soon as she heard it.</p>
