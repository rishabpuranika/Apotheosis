  <p>
</p>

  <p>Confused, Kenelm didn't know why Luo Zheng asked such a question. All he knew was that the Noxious Army Ants were fatal.</p>

  <p>"The Noxious Army Ants are terrifying not just because of their poison. In fact, they are incredibly fast, and they are not afraid of water or fire.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it's difficult to kill them with normal methods," Kenelm sighed in dismay. "Thank you for taking the trouble of coming with us, Luo Zheng. For now, it's better if we just go back. It's not worthy to risk our lives here."</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was still intrigued by the ants and continued to ask, "If these Noxious Army Ants come to surround and attack us, will you guys be able to resist any of them?"</p>

  <p>Giving Luo Zheng a surprised glance, Kenelm responded, "Well, it's already a given fact that it's difficult for us to kill them. However, we can still manage to keep some distance away from them. Luo Zheng, you keep on asking some really weird questions. What do you want to do? Is it..."</p>

  <p>As Kenelm's voice trailed off, Luo Zheng's gaze was already rested on the young man not far away.</p>

  <p>The young man was still leaning on the cave's wall waiting for them to leave. Apparently he had heard Luo Zheng's words, and a cold smile immediately appeared on his face. "If you want to die, then just tell me. I can send you..."</p>

  <p>But before he could finish what he wanted to say, Luo Zheng already jumped up and flew towards him.</p>

  <p>When the young man saw that Luo Zheng was daring enough to dash towards him, the cold smile on his face suddenly became even wilder. He blew a gentle whistle, and the Noxious Army Ants hiding on the surrounding walls of the cave immediately fell like raindrops, rushing towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Luo Zheng's move, Kenelm was shocked. He cursed in his heart that Luo Zheng was being too impulsive and stupid that he was not able to stop him.</p>

  <p>Even if they really wanted to take action, he should first rush to the man who controlled the Noxious Army Ants as fast as the speed of light.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng flew towards the young man so leisurely that Kenelm could foresee that Luo Zheng would be bitten by the Noxious Army Ants in an instant.</p>

  <p>Why was he courting death this way?</p>

  <p>At that point, it was evident that Kenelm didn't know what Luo Zheng was intending to do.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Luo Zheng feared that they could not resist the Noxious Army Ants' attacks. If he pranced to reach the young man, then it was likely that most of them would be attracted to him.</p>

  <p>As for the deadly poison of the Noxious Army Ants, it was not Luo Zheng's concern at all.</p>

  <p>Duh duh duh...</p>

  <p>One by one, the Noxious Army Ants fell on Luo Zheng's body, reaching out their stings and stabbing them mercilessly into Luo Zheng's skin as they injected toxin into his body.</p>

  <p>When the Noxious Army Ants injected the toxin into Luo Zheng's skin, a wisp of dark green aura suddenly appeared on Luo Zheng's skin which spread all over his whole body in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>'These Noxious Army Ants actually pierced right through my skin.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the toxin spreads very fast...' Luo Zheng's eyes flickered as the toxins seeped through his skin.</p>

  <p>However, as deadly and poisonous as the Noxious Army Ants were, they were still unable to cause Luo Zheng any harm.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was flying through the ants, his body gave a quick tremble.</p>

  <p>Normally, ordinary beasts would have been pulverized upon such an impact. However, tiny as they might seem, the small bodies of the Noxious Army Ants were very strong. Luo Zheng's attempt just simply made the attached ants be shaken off his body, falling down to the ground unhurt.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the young man leaning on the cave wall shot a glance at Luo Zheng as if he was looking at a dead and cold corpse. "I've seen a lot of stupid men in my life, but I've never seen anyone so stupid as to court death in this very pathetic way."</p>

  <p>This young man was so gifted at controlling various strange insects.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Truth of Cultivation Nature that he practiced was not something that most True Gods could easily deal with. In fact, he could kill people without being noticed in many cases.</p>

  <p>He was tasked to scare several foolish people away from the place, but only this time, he didn't expect that there would be an idiot among them who would even insist on offering his life.</p>

  <p>Knowing how powerful and deadly the ants were, he assumed that Luo Zheng would be paralyzed, falling to the ground in a few seconds after being bitten. Moreover, his body would rot instantly, resulting in his death. The young man had already seen a lot of such miserable deaths.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng and the young man were separated by only over a thousand feet. Nevertheless, Luo Zheng managed to cross the distance in an instant although he had knowingly restrained his speed.</p>

  <p>Stopping in front of the young man, he calmly asked, "Are you waiting for the poison to kill me?"</p>

  <p>Afterwards, a dark green aura emerged on Luo Zheng's face little by little, indicating that the toxin of the Noxious Army Ants was already spreading fast and rampaging within his body. But when he saw that Luo Zheng was still full of vigor and vitality, the young man got a little confused.</p>

  <p>'What's happening? Why is he still alive?' thought the young man. What he saw did not match what he knew about the ants' toxin. To him, Luo Zheng was obviously poisoned but he was not entirely affected by the poison at all.</p>

  <p>How could this be possible?</p>

  <p>"Ahh, you don't need to wait for that to happen. I'm sure that you will die earlier than me." Luo Zheng smiled, and the aura within his body burst out unexpectedly. All of a sudden, there was a flash of cold light in his hand, and a long and shiny sword appeared on it. Taking advantage of this moment, he had taken the initiative to launch an attack.</p>

  <p>The young man was disoriented at the sight in front of him. He was taken aback when he saw that Luo Zheng was already slashing in front of him.</p>

  <p>And in a snap, there was a flash of green light, and he completely disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>However, the young man's skill of using the Truth of Cultivation Nature was deemed to be more powerful than that of Luo Zheng's. After all, Luo Zheng had not practiced any cultivation method to exert the Truth of Divine Dao so far.</p>

  <p>If this young man hid himself in a corner and kept still, then Luo Zheng would not be able to detect him at all.</p>

  <p>However, as long as the young man moved, Luo Zheng would be able to find some traces of him and locate him by using his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swung his sword, and a mark of a deep groove was left on the cave's wall.</p>

  <p>After hiding, the young man ingeniously rushed to the depths of the cave at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's mouth gave a little smirk as he activated the Truth of Cultivation Nature. With this skill, his body immediately became casual and agile, similar to that of a leaf that had just fallen from a tree. He appeared to be drifting aimlessly, but the truth was that he was closely following the young man's footsteps as carefully as he could.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>As he was drifting through the cave, Luo Zheng waved his sword.</p>

  <p>And every time he slashed the sword, a green light would flash in front of him. Then he would move dozens of feet further in the cave and thrust the sword again...</p>

  <p>Every time Luo Zheng's sword waved, sounds of a metallic collision could be heard as if his sword hit a solid shield.</p>

  <p>Beyond this endeavor, Luo Zheng kept his calm and proceeded with caution.</p>

  <p>He swung his sword for the eighth time when suddenly, the sound of metal collision was put to an end. He looked at his sword and noticed that it was nailed to the cave's wall.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, a ball of green light materialized in front of the long sword, soon followed by the appearance of the young man.</p>

  <p>The young man held a huge bug shell on his hand. This shell was so durable that it was able to withstand and even resist Luo Zheng's sword strikes. After unleashing ninety percent of his strength, Luo Zheng finally pierced the bug shell directly, causing the sword to stab into the young man's chest.</p>

  <p>"Why, why aren't you afraid of the Noxious Army Ants' poison?" asked the young man as he stared at Luo Zheng with utmost disbelief.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng's face was still spiked with a dark green color. He was clearly poisoned, but it was still a mystery as to why he remained unscathed.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid of the Noxious Army Ants' poison, nor any other poison you can name of. If you don't believe, you can try the scorpion sting in your hand," Luo Zheng said faintly.</p>

  <p>The young man looked at his hand with a worried face and shot a glance back at Luo Zheng again. In his right hand was a scorpion sting from the Doom Scorpion's tail. Being more poisonous than the Noxious Army Ants, this scorpion sting was his last resort if he still wanted to live.</p>

  <p>He had turned the tables around as he narrowly escaped from death several times with the scorpion sting's help. This time, however, he didn't expect that Luo Zheng would expose the secret of this lifesaver.</p>

  <p>Desperate, the young man turned his right hand over and deliberately shot the scorpion sting at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But before the poison could reach Luo Zheng, he twisted his sword and unleashed a vigorous force, leaving the young man pulverized to bits.</p>

  <p>"This cave boasts such wonderful scenery, and is indeed the perfect place to bury you," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>
