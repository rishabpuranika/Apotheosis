  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was because of the Chaos Ancient Gods that the Black Ship had spent their days sailing endlessly, never settling down in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient Gods didn't like the Black Ship, so they couldn't establish a stronghold in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The six Chaos Ancient Gods had secretly been working behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>"How powerful will Othniel's control over the space be?" Edith asked, eyes wide with astonishment.</p>

  <p>She had once been told by the captain of the Black Ship that she was probably the most talented person in the Source World in terms of manipulating space.</p>

  <p>However, even she paled in comparison to the Chaos Ancient God, who had mastered the space truth.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we're about to find out," the captain said gravely.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the Black Ship never cowered away from battling other super forces.</p>

  <p>However, when faced with the Chaos Ancient Gods themselves, even the Black Ship knew this would be quite the challenge.</p>

  <p>They had been lucky enough to avoid the Chaos Ancient Gods in the past, but this time, it seemed there was no way out of this.</p>

  <p>"Should we summon him?" Shera suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the captain, squinting. Apparently, he had been well prepared.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A huge hole ripped through the bottom of a black ship, from which Mahoney emerged.</p>

  <p>Rage flashed in her eyes as she scanned her surroundings, searching for her prey. She had wanted to join hands with the captain of the Black Ship to fight against the Snake Goddess, yet he double-crossed her and imprisoned her on a black ship!</p>

  <p>While it had taken her a great deal of effort to get out, all she wanted to do now was seek revenge.</p>

  <p>Mahoney activated her spiritual sense, and soon she found another black ship nearby.</p>

  <p>Tearing through space once more, she teleported to the next black ship in a single breath. "Captain," she smiled. "Don't blame me for what happens next!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A formidable energy wave emanated from Mahoney's body. Immense Jun of force formed a ring around her as she threw a punch towards the black ship.</p>

  <p>Just as her fist connected with the hull of the ship, she heard a loud thud coming from within it.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Apparently, this black ship also contained a prisoner? the goat monster that the Divine Farmer had transformed into.</p>

  <p>Even if it had more power than the Snake Goddess, it couldn't match her intelligence. It hadn't been able to escape the black ship till then.</p>

  <p>Now, as Mahoney and the goat monster smashed the hull from both inside and outside at the same time, the black ship broke into pieces under their joint efforts.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>As the black ship collapsed before her, Mahoney drew her fist back to throw another punch, thinking the person on the ship was its captain.</p>

  <p>To her astonishment, it turned out to be a goat monster!</p>

  <p>The goat monster was in a state of rage when it emerged from its prison.</p>

  <p>Seeing someone about to attack it, it didn't hesitate to strike back.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer's original consciousness was buried deep; the goat monster practically had a mind of its own. Unfortunately for Mahoney, it couldn't see that she was actually an ally.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Though exceptionally good at melee combat, Mahoney was at a distinct disadvantage when faced with this invincible goat monster.</p>

  <p>Before she could even throw her punch, the goat monster rammed right into her. Countless cracks appeared on her armor.</p>

  <p>"You...!"</p>

  <p>Mahoney was stunned for a moment before she recognized her opponent. It was the goat monster that Divine Farmer transformed into using his bloodline power!</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she cried as the goat monster smashed its sturdy hoof on Mahoney's chest, knocking the breath out of her.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The armor on her chest shattered instantly, and the impact caused her to fall to the ground like a meteor.</p>

  <p>"Divine Farmer, stop it..."</p>

  <p>Mahoney pleaded weakly, but the goat monster wouldn't listen to reason.</p>

  <p>Without giving her time to breathe, it thrust at her with its sharp horns.</p>

  <p>Mahoney felt immense fear. How miserable it would be to be killed by an ally!</p>

  <p>As soon as she crashed into the ground, she jumped to her feet and tried to escape into the distance, like a streak of lightning.</p>

  <p>Mahoney flew very fast, but the goat monster was even faster. Bleating angrily, the goat monster gave chase.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Xuanyuan was also preoccupied, running as fast as he could along the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Behind him, numerous marks of Eight Diagrams kept appearing on the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>As the marks exploded, they formed huge holes on the boundary wall, as if an invisible giant beast had sunk its teeth into it.</p>

  <p>If Xuanyuan dared slow down, he risked having a mark of Eight Diagrams catch up to him.</p>

  <p>Once that happened, the punches would follow.</p>

  <p>The instant a mark of Eight Diagrams landed on Xuanyuan's body, a fist radiance already exploded on him all at once.</p>

  <p>In his peak state, Fuxi was a force to be reckoned with. Even a single strike from him could pose a huge threat to any Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Slowly but surely, he forced the Xuanyuan to a dead end.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Before Xuanyuan could figure out what to do next, the fist radiance and the mark of Eight Diagrams exploded on his body.</p>

  <p>The power in those moves was so destructive that it rampaged within his body.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan slammed heavily into the boundary wall. Spitting out a mouthful of blood, his face paled as his body weakened rapidly.</p>

  <p>He knew he couldn't defeat Fuxi, but he never thought it would end so miserably.</p>

  <p>"How did you make such a rapid progress with your strength?" Xuanyuan looked at Fuxi piteously, his tone full of mixed emotions.</p>

  <p>Fuxi floated in the air, looking down at the Xuanyuan. "I'm not really fast in my cultivation." A sly smile crept on his face. "Instead, you're too slow. After you joined the Element Spirit race, you unconsciously slacked off on cultivation. How much do you know about the Three Purities Stage?"</p>

  <p>Some time ago, Fuxi, Xuanyuan, and Divine Farmer were all roughly on the same level of strength. Back then, it never would've crossed Fuxi's mind that he would defeat Xuanyuan with ease.</p>

  <p>However, after reaching the Eternal Realm, Xuanyuan and the others had grown lax under the protection of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>The resources granted to them by the Element Spirit race had indeed helped them improve by leaps and bounds over a certain period of time. However, this meant their activities were limited.</p>

  <p>They couldn't explore the areas that the Element Spirit race forbade them from entering.</p>

  <p>So, while they might have been protected, they also had little room for exploration and growth.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, things were different for Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>They had to take huge risks every step of the way in Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Even if the Element Spirit Civilization controlled the 'exit' for Stage Thirty-three, even they hadn't completely explored every nook and cranny of the stage. There were still a large number of areas that remained a mystery to them.</p>

  <p>Fuxi couldn't count how many times he'd risked his life to explore new areas. However, he had grown stronger each time.</p>

  <p>It was because he had chosen to take the rougher path that he had grown stronger than the other masters at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan stared at Fuxi wordlessly, unable to come up with a response.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, he was jealous of Fuxi's great power. If he had known things would turn out like this, he might have made different choices.</p>

  <p>But it was too late for regrets. This was the path he had chosen.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, Xuanyuan suddenly smiled. With a crazed look in his eyes, he threw his head back and laughed. "Do you really think you've won this war?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi clenched his fist. "At least... I've won against you."</p>

  <p>A mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on Xuanyuan's body, and Fuxi threw out another incredibly powerful punch.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The earth-splitting power of the punch exploded on Xuanyuan's body.</p>

  <p>However, as the dust cleared, Xuanyuan still leaned quietly against the boundary wall, unscathed. There was an invisible space in front of him which had blocked the blow completely.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes narrowed in realization. Angrily, he whipped his head upwards to look to the sky.</p>

  <p>There was only one person in the entire chaos who would be able to control space this way? Othniel, one of the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>Something in Fuxi's eyes began to burn like crazy.</p>

  <p>There was a huge gap of strength between an Eternal Realm master and the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>Still, even when he was imprisoned at the bottom of the chaos, Fuxi had always wondered if he was capable of killing a Chaos Ancient God...</p>
