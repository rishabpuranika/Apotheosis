<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng walked forward and respectfully folded his hands before the human Holy Soul. "Master Pearce."</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't clearly see the Soul of Light clearly, but it was easy to distinguish Pearce's aura. Libby also bowed to Pearce.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for such courtesies," Pearce said, waving a hand. "You've already made it this far, so we can treat each other as equals from now on."</p>

  <p>In the Source World, seniority was based on strength. Pearce was treating them as peers with all honesty.</p>

  <p>The only reason he had come here was to lead Zheng into Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been able to fight powerful Eternal Realm creatures like the Blood Spirit Tortoise even before reaching the Eternal Realm. If he were to become an Eternal Warrior, wouldn't his strength advance by leaps and bounds to a terrifying level?</p>

  <p>That was why Pearce could be unbothered by the others who entered Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, but when Zheng arrived, he had a discussion with the masters of the Oneness Sky Palace before going to personally meet him.</p>

  <p>As the human's star ring continued to spin, the three of them turned into white light and shot towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>After they emerged from the star ring, Zheng looked around from force of habit.</p>

  <p>The scenery he saw in each stage of the Other Shore varied greatly and he was used to it. But what he now saw shocked him.</p>

  <p>When Zheng looked into the distance, he saw a bronze plain.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Grand Plain Stage?" Zheng asked, unable to conceal his surprise.</p>

  <p>It was not right to call this place a 'plain'. It was simply a huge, endless bronze iron plate, with nothing on it.</p>

  <p>"No wonder it's called the Grand Plain Stage. It's really as flat as a plain,"</p>

  <p>Libby said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that the star ring had disappeared and turned around to ask,</p>

  <p>"Why did the star ring disappear?"</p>

  <p>They had just been transmitted up through the star ring of the Sanskrit Light Stage, but the star ring had disappeared the moment they arrived. This greatly confused Zheng.</p>

  <p>Pearce had expected Zheng's confusion, but he was in no hurry to explain. So he merely pointed to the ground and said, "Look at the ground. You might be able to figure out the reason."</p>

  <p>As Zheng's gaze lowered, he caught sight of a sculpture on the bronze ground beneath his feet. It was a star ring.</p>

  <p>"Is this the star ring?" Zheng was even more puzzled.</p>

  <p>The sculpture on the ground was nothing more than just a painting.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is the star ring," Pearce said with a smile. "Look at the star rings around you. They are of different sizes and belong to different races."</p>

  <p>Zheng took a few steps forward to look at the sculptures of the star rings and realized that they were neatly distributed on the bronze ground.</p>

  <p>It looked like there were many star rings here, but all of them had been pressed into the ground and turned into a picture.</p>

  <p>"Why are these star rings embedded in the ground?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"In addition to the star rings, there are many other things embedded in the ground," Libby said, a smile lacing her voice. "Look."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked down along the star rings and discovered what made this bronze plain so unique.</p>

  <p>Not far from them was a vast desert, painted onto the ground. All kinds of strange monsters were on it and a temple stood at the end of the desert.</p>

  <p>"Do the desert, monsters, and temple all exist?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He began to understand these concepts bit by bit.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that Stage Thirty-two looked like a lifeless plain, but everything in this stage had turned into a painting.</p>

  <p>At this sight, Zheng thought of the Eternal Scroll Painting and asked, "Is this bronze ground the so-called Eternal Scroll Painting? These creatures are all at the Eternal Realm, right?"</p>

  <p>Pearce laughed. "Yes! This bronze ground is also called the Eternal Scroll Painting. It's just the second volume of the painting. The first volume is above our heads,"</p>

  <p>Pearce said, pointing to the sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked up to see a colorful sky.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't have discovered the mystery of it if he had thrown it a casual glance. But now, after carefully examining the sky, Zheng was able to distinguish a huge rectangular scroll painting. But this scroll painting had colors swirling within it. It was nothing like the vivid sculptures of creatures with various forms on the bronze ground.</p>

  <p>"You two come with me," Pearce said as he began to walk. "The Grand Plain Stage is also divided into two layers, like the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>Most creatures on the lower layer are either Other Shore creatures that live within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, or Holy Soul Realm warriors like us. There are also many temples that have been built there."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Pearce pointed in the three directions in the distance.</p>

  <p>The number of the temples in the Grand Plain Stage was huge. There were three temples just in this small area.</p>

  <p>"Some Other Shore creatures are very powerful, such as these Corrosive Calamity Crabs. Even though we have reached the Holy Soul Realm, we don't dare provoke them," said Pearce, pointing at his feet.</p>

  <p>Crabs were engraved on the bronze ground where he was pointing to. dozens of horse-like creatures ran helter-skelter before these Corrosive Calamity Crabs.</p>

  <p>Zheng observed them keenly for a while before asking, "Are the crabs chasing those horses?"</p>

  <p>"They are Cloud Pattern Horses," Pearce said, nodding. "The Corrosive Calamity Crabs like capturing these horses as their prey. The Cloud Pattern Horses run fast but they just can't escape the Corrosive Calamity Crabs."</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned as he thought over what Pearce had told him. "But the sculptures on the ground don't change at all. How do they move in this scroll painting?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>If these creatures could really enter the painting to live in it, then everything on the painting should be moving around. But it seemed to him that the painting was a dead thing.</p>

  <p>"The painting changes from time to time," Pearce answered before something in the distance caught his eye and his expression shifted. "Looks like the change has come. What a coincidence."</p>

  <p>In the far distance, a white flashing light seemed to grow closer to them. It was fast and had reached the group in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>After this light had blown over it, the painting on the bronze ground seemed to change.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Pattern Horses, which had been frozen mid-run before, had now disappeared. The Corrosive Calamity Crabs had gathered together. Broken legs and heads of horses could be seen on their huge pincers.</p>

  <p>These Corrosive Calamity Crabs had obviously caught the Cloud Pattern Horses and eaten them.</p>

  <p>"The sculptures on the bronze ground change every hour," said Pearce.</p>

  <p>"I see," Zheng said, finally understanding how it worked.</p>

  <p>As he walked behind Pearce, Zheng saw sculptures of mountains, rivers, deserts, and even suns. All sorts of strange scenes greeted his eyes.</p>

  <p>They had moved for quite some distance before the sculpture of a huge temple appeared on the ground. A three-foot-long sword sat on top of the temple. This was the temple built in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore by the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>
