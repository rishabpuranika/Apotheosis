<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Other Shore hadn't always been the same. Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others hadn't returned to the high stages in a long time, they didn't know that they had undergone earth-shattering changes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was hesitant now. He wondered whether he should listen to Feng Ge and leave when the blood fog appeared, or just barge through.</p>

  <p>It would be great if the Blood Fog Spell that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had mentioned really existed.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, does the Blood Fog Spell still have an effect?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven said, "You'll know when you try."</p>

  <p>The Blood Fog Spell was similar to the Illusion Breaking Rune and was easy to master. Luo Zheng had mastered it in less than five minutes. He then walked to the edge of the round platform.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and the others were confused at Luo Zheng's behavior and thought that he was about to tease the Garuda like the short Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>But they heard Luo Zheng vaguely chant something.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng had recited, the blood in the abyss at the foot of the mountain boiled even more fiercely, as if a fierce beast was emerging from it.</p>

  <p>A trace of bright red blood floated up into the air.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and the others gasped, their eyes widening in shock.</p>

  <p>"How has the blood fog appeared so soon?"</p>

  <p>"He can summon the blood fog?!"</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of such a method before!"</p>

  <p>The Blood Fog Spell was not a complicated method, but the Element Spirit race had erased it from history for a long time. There still remained a small number of people who had mastered this method, but no outsider knew of it.</p>

  <p>As they watched the blood fog spreading, the Souls of Light rushed cheerily into the path.</p>

  <p>But the blood fog seemed to consider Luo Zheng as the center and spread around him. It wouldn't move if Luo Zheng didn't move forward. This caused the Souls of Light to come to halt and wait for Luo Zheng to take the lead.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, who was standing behind Luo Zheng, whispered to him, "Did that senior master teach you this?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," Luo Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>After he had carried the book, he had owned a number of abilities within himself that he couldn't explain. Feng Ge knew the truth, and Luo Zheng also hadn't the slightest intention of hiding it from her.</p>

  <p>They had no idea who had built the paths that connected those otherwise isolated peaks.</p>

  <p>When the Garudas saw people moving ahead on the path below, they spread their wings and pounced down upon the path. But the moment they approached the blood fog, they flapped their wings and flew backwards, crying out in disgust.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and his companions moved along the path, the blood fog moved along with them.</p>

  <p>It faded away about an hour after it started following Luo Zheng. At this, Luo Zheng chanted the Blood Fog Spell again, and the blood fog became denser and denser once again.</p>

  <p>They had just passed the last peak when a huge blood-red peak loomed ahead of them. The surrounding small peaks were nothing compared to this one.</p>

  <p>At the top of this peak was a huge platform, on which floated a blurry city.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Soul City?" Luo Zheng muttered, looking at the blurry city with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>It was more a mirage than a city.</p>

  <p>The city wasn't real, but an illusion that sat at the top of the peak.</p>

  <p>"I think it is," said Feng Ge, her eyes burning with excitement. She had read some information about the Soul City, but this was the first time she was seeing it with her own eyes.</p>

  <p>"But it's just an illusion," Luo Zheng said with a frown. What he was seeing was beyond his expectations.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said a Soul of Light from behind him.</p>

  <p>The reason why they were able to come here so easily was because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They didn't have anything with which to repay him, which was why they were willing to give out information they knew. The Soul of Light continued, "The Soul City itself is made up of souls. It is said that it sucked tens of millions of souls before becoming what it is now. So the city you see is similar to a Soul of Light."</p>

  <p>"The city formed by Souls of Light is so huge!" Luo Zheng gasped, shocked.</p>

  <p>A short while later, he and Feng Ge passed through the long, winding path and reached the top of the peak. The blood fog that had followed him dissipated here.</p>

  <p>The gate of the Soul City was huge and grayish brown.</p>

  <p>Two gigantic square columns sat on both sides. When Luo Zheng walked to one of the columns, he could hear a moan emanating from within.</p>

  <p>The square column itself was formed by Souls of Light. They could see dark brown masses within it floated ceaselessly, with many strange faces on them.</p>

  <p>"Are these Souls of Light still alive?" Luo Zheng asked with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Of course they are alive, but they are and will always be a part of the Soul City. They can't be reborn forever!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"It looks like I have underestimated the Soul City," Luo Zheng muttered, growing serious.</p>

  <p>The Soul City tested the Souls of Light. Only Indigo Souls at the ultimate level were qualified to enter the city. As it opened once every 132 hours, most of the Souls of Light would leave the Other Shore after arriving and would enter the city when its door opened.</p>

  <p>Most of the Souls of Light that stayed at the entrance of the city hadn't reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul yet. They either sat cross-legged at the entrance and cultivated, or tried to collect enough soul crystal to strengthen themselves.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge, wait for me here," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body was here, but his Soul of Light was still in the lower stage. If he wanted to enter the Soul City, he had to come with his Soul of Light. Feng Ge had a natural advantage over him since her physical body was just similar to an "armor" which protected her soul on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was not as troublesome as Luo Zheng's body. Now that he had sent Feng Ge here, he had to bring his Soul of Light up.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge nodded in response and waited.</p>

  <p>It took some time for Luo Zheng's Soul of Light to arrive here from the lower stage. Without the protection of his physical body, Luo Zheng's Soul of Light, which was at the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, was relatively weak and he still had to pass through Stage Twenty-eight.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Element Spirit race paid most of their attention to his physical body, which was why they didn't do a strict inspection of the Souls of Light. What was more, it wouldn't be easy for them to recognize Luo Zheng's Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>After safely crossing Stage Twenty-eight, Luo Zheng quickly came to Stage Twenty-nine, the Constant Glory Stage. He used the Blood Fog Spell to move forward. It took him more than half a day of non-stop journey to finally appear at the entrance of the Soul City and meet Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The two of them continued to wait at the gate of the Soul City. A day later, more and more Souls of Light appeared at the gate.</p>

  <p>They included members of the Separate Abyss race, the Azure Wolf race, the New Moon race, and the human race.</p>

  <p>Souls of Light of all races had emerged.</p>

  <p>The previously quiet square in front of the Soul City became noisy almost instantly.</p>

  <p>"To enter the Soul City, you need reach the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. You will be courting death if you don't. I still have the soul crystal that I'm selling at a low price. Only three million soul pills per finger-size trunk." an Ear Mouse exclaimed, seizing the opportunity to sell its soul crystal.</p>
