<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pearson told the Wing King the story of the Regal Jade Spirit in detail.</p>

  <p>The Wing King was silent for a while before he sighed and said, "It looks like Dashawn had done a lot of things after we left. It's my fault. We shouldn't have left him behind."</p>

  <p>Dashawn enjoyed a status that was almost the same with the Regal Jade Spirit in Zheng's body. He was also the core figure of the Regal Jade Civilization and the Wing King's right-hand man.</p>

  <p>"Dashawn didn't regret anything or blame you. He just wanted me to tell you everything he had done," Pearson said.</p>

  <p>The Wing King nodded and said, "I see. I hope, one day, you can take me to the place where he died."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will!" Pearson said, folding his hands in respect.</p>

  <p>He was also a man who valued friendship. He wouldn't otherwise have risked his life to stay with Thurston and Sawyer. Zheng and his group were chased all over by all the warriors from other races in the Grand Pure Realm. No other place in the Grand Pure Realm was more dangerous than where he was staying with them.</p>

  <p>But there was now something more important to do, which was why they couldn't immediately visit Dashawn's resting place to pay tribute to him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>More gusts of purple wind swept over them.</p>

  <p>The purple wind had completely occupied the space in the middle of the Purple Wind Gorge.</p>

  <p>No one knew what kind of method the Wing King had used. He could always find space in the purple wind and dodge it. And no matter how close the purple wind was to him, it could never wrap itself around him.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine was also trembling in the Wing King's claws.</p>

  <p>Thanks to their keen senses, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others could perceive that this trembling was actually a strange bodily movement technique, which was the secret method to avoid the purple wind.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care about these details. He stared at the purple wind and asked,</p>

  <p>"There is no purple wind on normal days. What's it like at the bottom of the Purple Wind Gorge?"</p>

  <p>"There is a kind of shellfish that is very weak," answered the Wing King.</p>

  <p>"After taking root at the bottom of the Purple Wind Gorge, they can't move for a lifetime, which is why they lack the means to find food. Fortunately, as creatures of Stage Thirty-three, these shellfish also have a strange theurgy."</p>

  <p>"Is the purple wind their bloodline theurgy?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Wing King continued. "These shellfish release the purple wind, but it's not to seal off the Purple Wind Gorge or to deal with the warriors from other races above. They are just hunting for food. They release the purple wind to hunt for food when they begin to reproduce."</p>

  <p>"The warriors from other races that fell down have all become their food!</p>

  <p>It's really amazing!" Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>As for how the Wing King avoided the purple wind, Zheng didn't ask.</p>

  <p>When he had started to decide the route in the beginning, Zheng had known that the Wing King had entered the Three Purities Stage from the Regal Jade Spirit in his body. The Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization could sense the position of the Wing King.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit had told Zheng with certainty that the Wing King could easily take the group through the Purple Wind Gorge.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that everything had come through even though there had been a little trouble in the process.</p>

  <p>"Did you choose the Whining Road?" the Wing King asked again.</p>

  <p>The Wing King had once led many of the Eternal Realm warriors of the Regal Jade Civilization to advance into the Supreme Pure Realm. But they failed when they were four hundred miles from the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization was strong enough. They had merely chosen a different path.</p>

  <p>At the time, the Wing King had been in a hurry to prove himself. After entering the Three Purities Stage, he had led his people towards the Supreme Pure Realm through the Flame Road.</p>

  <p>The Flame Road was a very difficult road. There were very few people who chose this road to enter the Supreme Pure Realm. At the time, the Wing King had overestimated the strength of the Element Spirit Civilization, which was why he had suffered a great defeat.</p>

  <p>If the Wing King hadn't been in a hurry, it would not have been impossible for him to enter the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Wing King," said the Snake Goddess, folding her hands towards him in respect.</p>

  <p>"I've heard that the Whining Road is a dangerous road. Are you sure you will succeed?" the Wing King asked again.</p>

  <p>They had failed near the entrance of the Flame Road, which was a pain he would never get rid of in his lifetime. It had made him extremely sensitive to these roads.</p>

  <p>"We passed successfully," said Fuxi proudly.</p>

  <p>The Wing King nodded, but his expression soon turned gloomy. "That's good. I failed when I had the chance."</p>

  <p>"It's not that your strength wasn't enough. You just didn't have a thorough understanding of these roads at the time," the Snake Goddess said, trying to reassure him.</p>

  <p>The creatures on the Other Shore knew more about the Three Purities Stage with the passing of time. Just like the mysterious veil had been pulled down bit by bit, the creatures that had later tried had become more familiar with these roads. It would now naturally be easier to pass through them.</p>

  <p>"I think I can benefit from your success this time and enter the Supreme Pure Realm with you," the Wing King added.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on the Snake Goddess's face. "Wing King, you are being modest."</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>As the wide wings of the Wing King flapped fiercely, the group of people in the purple wind sped up again.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, the Wing King began to rise upwards. He flew upwards for a while before emerging from the purple wind.</p>

  <p>Towards everyone's left was a cliff that stretched for thousands of miles. On the right was an endless plain.</p>

  <p>Once the Wing King put the Heavenly Eye Vine down, Zheng began to look at the scenery in the distance, a strange expression soon crossing his face.</p>

  <p>"I'm now standing in the north and facing the south," Zheng said, pointing at the plain in front of him. "If I keep going along this plain, won't I reach the south of the Grand Pure Realm?"</p>

  <p>To put it more simply, if this plain was the center of the Grand Pure Realm, they could have reached this place if they had gone up along the Divine River and then crossed it after they came out of the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>They needn't have spent so much effort in going around it.</p>

  <p>"That's not a plain," the Snake Goddess said, walking up to him. "It's just an illusion. The entrance is over there."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess pointed at a place a little distance away.</p>

  <p>There were two rows of inconspicuous fences.</p>

  <p>A simple entrance sat in between these two rows of fences.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at this sight. The fences weren't remarkable but Zheng should have noticed them. The fact that they hadn't struck him was strange.</p>

  <p>"If we had walked through the plain, the only road to the Supreme Pure Realm would be through the entrance between these two rows of fences."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stretched out her slender fingers and drew a line in the air. "If you don't walk through this road and try to pass through other places on both sides, you will be lost forever in this endless plain."</p>

  <p>"Is this illusion that powerful?" Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>As the Snake Goddess nodded, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice rang out in Zheng's mind. "This plain is not an illusion!"</p>

  <p>"If it weren't an illusion, we could just come out of the plain by retracing our steps. Why would we be lost forever?" Zheng asked in his mind.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven chuckled. "Those who enter the plain can no longer turn around. The thoughts of all of the people who enter the plain will change irreversibly and they will lose the ability of turning back."</p>

  <p>"Is turning back also a kind of ability?" Zheng was speechless.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and changing your thoughts doesn't mean modifying your memories.</p>

  <p>It's by making you not realize you have this ability of turning around, so that you can only move forward permanently. You know something is wrong, but you will never be able to figure out what it is," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained, shrugging. "This is indeed a miraculous plain. It can suppress the thoughts and logic of all living beings."</p>
