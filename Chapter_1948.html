<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1948 The Tragedy Of The Weak </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Blood Curse Technique was also a way of employing the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The reason for this was that the malicious Mu Ning was actually a sort of curse. In the Evolutionary Universe, there was no systematic approach for using the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword, who had taught Luo Luo Zheng the Gods-intimidating Strike, had devised a way of taking advantage of the malicious Mu Ning to suppress one's emotions thereby helping to ace the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the Sacred race's method of deploying the malicious Mu Ning was much more advanced.</p>

  <p>This was because they could transfer the curses in the malicious Mu Ning however they pleased.</p>

  <p>Every creature could spread curses before dying. The cursing power of an individual was insignificant, but combined with the power of millions of living beings, it was incredible and not something to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>The Blood Curse Technique only affected other members belonging to the same race.</p>

  <p>For example, if the Blood Curse Technique was enchanted using human blood, it could only be targeted at living humans, and creatures of any other races would not be affected.</p>

  <p>So once the Sacred race carried out their plan successfully, the enchanted Blood Curse Technique used by them would only harm the human race and have no effect on their own race, the ogres, the Demon Night or even the wild beasts.</p>

  <p>Only human Supreme Lords did not fear the Blood Curse Technique. But if the world lords were under the influence of the curses for too long, they would also be harmed.</p>

  <p>Every time the Sacred race occupied a supreme world, they would enchant the Blood Curse Technique, so that they would not have to fend off a counterattack by the human race. Only the Supreme Lords were able to break the Blood Curse Technique.</p>

  <p>But in the current scenario, all Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe were hiding in the territory of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Anyone who dared to come alone would undoubtedly fail and die. Since the human race had lost three of their Supreme Lords, any new casualties would only tip the scales in the Sacred race's favor.</p>

  <p>This was the Sacred race's tactic to consolidate their attacks in a step-by-step method.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The whip of the Sacred warrior slashed down sharply like a vicious serpent.</p>

  <p>If the old woman and the little girl were to get hit by the whip, they would certainly get smashed into a bloody pulp.</p>

  <p>The other mortals around them watched on with indifferent and weary expressions. Nobody had the guts to step up and help them.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was like a group of demons from hell for these powerless mortals. Anyone who dared to fight them would be squashed brutally like a puny ant.</p>

  <p>Four hours earlier, over one hundred humans had protested that they needed to have a rest. But the only response they had received from the Sacred race was a lash of the whip.</p>

  <p>The wretched whip swept across the crowd like a sharp sword. As a result, over one hundred humans had been hacked in half and died miserably in a pool of blood.</p>

  <p>They had now realized that begging the Sacred race for mercy was meaningless. The only possible consequence, if any, was drawing their deaths closer.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, a figure clad in a yellow robe dashed toward the little girl suddenly and grabbed her arm before rolling swiftly to the side.</p>

  <p>Just as the girl was removed from danger, the whip lashed ruthlessly at the old woman.</p>

  <p>Instantly, her emaciated body was shredded to bits and then turned into a cloud of blood.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty!"</p>

  <p>The girl exclaimed in shock when she recognized the man who had saved her.</p>

  <p>After nodding at the little girl, the middle-aged man in the yellow robe looked up into the sky and said loudly, "Sir, please calm down! I will lead my people to move on. Please don't take it to heart."</p>

  <p>The three hundred thousand mortals were citizens of the Creek Kingdom. The yellow-robed man was the ruler of the kingdom, who was also the only Illuminating Soul Realm warrior of the small kingdom.</p>

  <p>The Creek Kingdom had developed significantly in these years. Two second-grade sects had been established in the kingdom, one of which was governed by the king himself.</p>

  <p>However, as the ruler of the small kingdom, he had no powers to fight against the warriors of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of the fact that the Sacred race would send his people to the Ultimate Immortal City as blood sacrifices, but he didn't have the strength to tackle them. The only thing he could do was to follow their orders obediently and move toward the Ultimate Immortal City.</p>

  <p>Over one hundred thousand people out of his five hundred thousand subjects had died during the journey. Some of them had been killed by the Sacred race, but most of them had dropped dead due to exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"Don't take it to heart? Did you take our orders to your heart? What if due to your slacking our plan got delayed?" The Internal Elixir Realm warrior of the Sacred race reprimanded the king coldly.</p>

  <p>The king of the Creek Kingdom was filled with resentment, and yet he knew they couldn't even protest. They were like weak lambs ready for slaughter in the eyes of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"Please, I will supervise my people and urge them to move faster," he begged, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. Right! Do your work well, you oaf!" the Sacred warrior snorted.</p>

  <p>For him, the king was as insignificant as the other humans, but they still needed him to control the large army of humans so that they could keep moving smoothly. Without the king's command, their speed might have been much slower, and many more people might have died!</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the Sacred race didn't want to kill too many mortals if possible. After all, their intention of taking these humans to the Ultimate Immortal City was to use their blood. If most of the people died on the way, their efforts would be in vain.</p>

  <p>The king let out a deep sigh. He turned to an official aide and ordered,</p>

  <p>"Send word to everyone that I have commanded them to move faster."</p>

  <p>The official was over seventy years old. Although he was also a martial artist, his physical condition had declined because of his old age. It was a Herculean task for a teenager to trek over forty miles in a day, let alone an old man like him.</p>

  <p>"But, Your Majesty... They can't take it much longer!" There was grief and indignation in the official's voice.</p>

  <p>Countless people had already succumbed to exhaustion on the way.</p>

  <p>Would all of them have such atrocious deaths?</p>

  <p>"We have no other choice. We have to endure it," ordered the king in a solemn voice.</p>

  <p>"Endure it? But when will it end? We will all be sent to the Ultimate Immortal City and these savage warriors will drain our blood for their usage!" A general of the Creek Kingdom couldn't help but yell angrily.</p>

  <p>He was a warrior at the consummation of nature level and had a violent temper. His patience had reached its limit and he could not hold back his anger any longer!</p>

  <p>"You're absolutely right! Even if we follow their orders without resisting, we will still get killed in the end!"</p>

  <p>"We are going to die anyway. Why don't we just go all out and fight these rascals?"</p>

  <p>"I would rather die right here, right now than become their blood sacrifice!"</p>

  <p>They were human beings, after all, not lambs for slaughtering. Lambs couldn't sense what was out there for them, so they would dumbly obey orders until the last moment came.</p>

  <p>Since these humans knew that there was no hope for survival, they no longer had any intentions of being mute spectators to their own deaths. If death was imminent, they would rather commit suicide than help the Sacred race with their plan.</p>

  <p>Discontent quickly spread among the crowd. After a long period of suppressing, the low-level warriors and mortals finally revolted.</p>

  <p>The little girl buried her head in the king's chest and did not dare to look around. Her grandmother had died miserably just a few moments ago.</p>

  <p>Her innocent mind had been tainted by the malice of the cruel world.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you doing? Do you all want to die right here?"</p>

  <p>Hearing the commotion below, the Sacred warrior floating in the sky brandished the whip in his hands and lashed down mercilessly.</p>

  <p>With a resounding crack, a barbaric Mu Ning emanated from the whip.</p>

  <p>Thwack!</p>

  <p>Several people were hit by the torturous whip and were instantly ripped to pieces. Bleeding fragments of their bodies scattered around, and the air was filled with screams from the crowd.</p>

  <p>The nature level warriors' eyes turned red with fury. They couldn't hold themselves back any longer.</p>

  <p>"I'll fight him to the death!"</p>

  <p>"Let's kill him!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Let's die a worthy death!"</p>

  <p>Nature creatures didn't have the ability to fly. They clambered up the towering walls on both sides of the valley and leaped into the sky to attack the Sacred warriors.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of sarcasm on the Sacred warrior's face as he snorted,</p>

  <p>"Do you think you are strong enough to take me on? You don't even have the ability to challenge me!"</p>

  <p>It was a ridiculous notion that a piddling lamb wanted to take on great warriors. This was the only thought in the Sacred warrior's mind.</p>

  <p>He waved his whip and it immediately turned to a vicious serpent, which slithered towards the nature level warriors with the intention of swallowing them all.</p>

  <p>The king of the Creek Kingdom closed his eyes. He didn't have the heart to see his people getting killed in front of him. His face was contorted in distress.</p>

  <p>Three months before, he had enjoyed the company of his many wives in the imperial palace. The whole kingdom had been living peacefully. But now, he had to witness his kingdom slip into the abyss of despair.</p>

  <p>He didn't have the strength to change their fates. This was the tragedy that befell on the weak.</p>

  <p>If he was powerful enough to kill the Internal Elixir Realm warrior, he might still have hope for saving his people.</p>

  <p>'Dear God! Is weakness an unforgivable sin?' he thought wistfully.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't hear any painful screams from his people. Instead, he heard the Sacred warrior yelling in shock, "Who the hell are you!"</p>

  <p>Surprised by this turn of events, the king opened his eyes and saw a human warrior appearing out of the blue and floating in the air. He pinched the whip between his fingers quite coolly and stopped it from wrecking any more havoc on the humans.</p>
