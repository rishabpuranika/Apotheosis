<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors on the Origin Mountain were able to come up with this replacement method, but that was not the case for Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>In the Land of Sword Grief, Zheng had written down the complete Truth Enlightenment and handed it to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>As soon as that was done, Feng Ge eagerly went straight to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>There were two reasons for her excitement: first, she wanted to personally hand it over to her father; second, she wanted to tell her father what she had seen in the Creation Myth Temple.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, she arrived at the Phoenix Palace. She was told that her father was in the Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>

  <p>She quickly went to the Supreme Dragon Hall, but the gate was heavily guarded and she couldn't see her father. Later on, she visited her mother, Flamine, instead. That was when she knew that her father was trapped on the Other Shore, and the Oneness Sky Palace was under a great crisis.</p>

  <p>She thought of Goran recruiting soldiers in the Land of Sword Grief before, and finally realized that the Oneness Sky Palace was really in great trouble this time.</p>

  <p>At this time, huge swords surrounded the Oneness Array.</p>

  <p>On top of the swords' hilts stood Athemar, Goran, and the other Oneness Governors.</p>

  <p>Then, two old men with grey hair stood on the two swords at the forefront of the Oneness Array.</p>

  <p>The man on the left was Pearce Gan, who had been following Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The man on the right was called Auden Ning.</p>

  <p>Many important officials of the Oneness Sky Palace were gathered on the Oneness Mountain. They were the group with the most number of members and also the strongest, but their respective leader was not there.</p>

  <p>Everyone present had extraordinary auras, but none of them was confident.</p>

  <p>"Based on the movement of the Sun Crows, they still intend to break the Vastness Array and capture the Mountain Sea Pass. It seems easy, but in reality it is very dangerous for them," said Pearce. He took out a small golden gourd as he spoke, pulled the cork, and took a sip of the wine.</p>

  <p>Auden's wrinkly face convulsed. The man was dressed in a cloth gown and he looked like an ordinary woodcutter. On his right hand was a rusty sword.</p>

  <p>Despite his plain appearance, all of the Oneness Governors in the gathering highly respected him.</p>

  <p>He and Pearce were known as Eastern Emperor Taiyi's very capable assistants. Both of them were slightly stronger than the Oneness Governors and were as strong as the mountain leaders.</p>

  <p>"The Sun Crows clearly know what will happen," Auden said in a shaky voice. "Once their main forces have gotten close to the Mountain Sea Pass, the nearest three passes and three arrays will kill them. They will suffer heavy casualties," he continued.</p>

  <p>While he explained, his fingers drew lines in the air and pointed out the locations of the passes, such as the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Athemar, Goran, and the others silently stared at the lines and passes and studied them seriously.</p>

  <p>"Elder Auden is right. Anyone with a discerning eye can see that it is a trap.</p>

  <p>They won't choose to do so, unless they are really arrogant, or..." Before Athemar could finish his sentence, he abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all of them began to feel anxious. No words were needed for them to know what could obviously happen.</p>

  <p>It was known that Gethin wasn't convinced when Eastern Emperor Taiyi had beaten him in the past. He had never admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, since the Vastness Mountain was one of the seven mountains, they could never rebel after Eastern Emperor Taiyi had taken control of the Bloom Divine Province. Thus, the Xu Clan and the Vastness Mountain both lived under the roof of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Yet, in the past few years, Gethin had secretly expanded his influence until the Vastness Mountain became as powerful as the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Although he never revealed his ambition, everyone knew what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Even then, he never dared to betray Eastern Emperor Taiyi as long as the emperor was alive.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, a great opportunity had now presented itself to him!</p>

  <p>If he wanted to rebel, he could help the Sun Crows from within the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>That could be the exact reason why the Sun Crows chose to attack Mountain Sea Pass first.</p>

  <p>These people from the Oneness Sky Palace were all intelligent beings, so they immediately knew what Gethin was up to based on some of his obscure movements. "What can we do?</p>

  <p>Are we going to attack Gethin now?" Goran asked. "Kill him," Auden answered with a glint in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't rebelled; that was only our guess. If he really wants to rebel, then he must be well prepared," said Pearce as he closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Everything would be fine if Eastern Emperor Taiyi was here, but since he is not, we will be at a dead end sooner or later," he added. "Well, we can't just sit still and wait for death no matter what. Now that things have come to this, we can only follow the established plan.</p>

  <p>If Gethin really dares to rebel?" Athemar countered, his eyes filled with determination.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. If he dares to rebel, I will perish with him," Auden reassured with a hesitant voice.</p>

  <p>The second he was done speaking, he stomped his feet on the ground.</p>

  <p>In turn, all the Lofty Swords outside the Oneness Array began to glow.</p>

  <p>It was Athemar who had made all the Lofty Swords, but everyone had control over them.</p>

  <p>As the Sun Crows continued to advance, everyone in the seven arrays and the twelve passes got ready to fight.</p>

  <p>On the lower tier of the Mountain Sea Pass</p>

  <p>"Alas, I thought we didn't need to be the bait since we had General Zheng, but..."</p>

  <p>"Now, we don't even have a chance to be the bait. With so many Sun Crows, we are doomed!"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. As human beings, we have to protect our families!"</p>

  <p>At that point, the Sun Crows had covered the entire heaven and earth. Even though the Other Shore Realm warriors on the lower tier couldn't see clearly what was happening, they knew that the Sun Crows were serious about this war.</p>

  <p>The reason they had hesitated earlier was that the Oneness Guards had driven them out to fight, but they themselves remained in the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Now that everyone, including the Oneness Generals and the Oneness Guards, was ready to attack, they did not complain anymore.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Sinclair felt his throat run dry at the sight of the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>As a leader, he should've said something reassuring to their army, but now he was restless and didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, purple lights glowed from behind the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Those lights transformed into swords that were tens of millions of feet long, and anyone who saw the lights felt their power and strength. Then, the sharp lights pierced through the air. It looked like they could penetrate through everything.</p>

  <p>"The Vastness Array is activated! Everyone, don't be discouraged. With the Vastness Array's support, we will not lose this battle!" Sinclair finally shouted to boost their army's morale.</p>

  <p>The shining sword radiance truly did make them feel more confident. The Oneness Guards, and the ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm finally felt resolute.</p>

  <p>At the source of the lights, an extraordinary aura emanated from Gethin as he sat cross-legged, his gaze fixed on the northeast.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair in the Mountain Sea Pass ahead is encouraging his soldiers,"</p>

  <p>Natasha said in an enchanting voice from beside Gethin.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering what expression he will have if he knows the truth. Ha-ha..." a leader of the intelligence agency sneered.</p>

  <p>Gethin snorted. "Those old men are smart and cunning. I'm afraid they have already figured out the truth seeing the Sun Crows' movements," he commented.</p>

  <p>A detached smile graced Natasha's lips. "So what? You didn't play any dirty tricks. What else can they do?" she remarked.</p>

  <p>The Vastness Mountain's rebellion wasn't actually a secret conspiracy, considering that the Oneness Sky Palace was already in danger. In fact, Gethin was open about it because he was sure that the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't do anything to him.</p>
