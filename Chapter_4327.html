<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4327 The World With Lines </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The downgrader crawled around for some distance, until he came across some white lines of varying lengths.</p>

  <p>Even though he was a downgrader, it was difficult for him to adapt to the form of the second-grade world in such a short time. Even he was a little stunned to see these white lines.</p>

  <p>But soon, he realized that these white lines were the ice crystals released by the Evil God before.</p>

  <p>These ice crystals still had the attribute of coldness, but after being downgraded, more abilities were unlocked. Now, five or six different types of energy could be released from the ice attribute.</p>

  <p>"After all the worlds were downgraded to the second grade, the total area of the entire world was expanded by thirty billion times..."</p>

  <p>"Additionally, the number of the energy types has also increased."</p>

  <p>"However, this world is too desolate."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there will be any more creatures..."</p>

  <p>The third-grade world was called the Lower Extreme World, wherein the word "extreme" represented the limit of life.</p>

  <p>Supposedly, all living beings could survive if they were downgraded from the high-grade world. But that wasn't the case in the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Although the area of the second-grade world had expanded to a terrifying extent, and the types of energy were also more abundant, this world no longer carried the conditions for living beings to survive. Thus, the creatures of the fourth-grade world wouldn't die when they entered the third-grade world, but the creatures of the third-grade world would be crushed to death when they entered the Wall World.</p>

  <p>The downgrader sped up, crawling along the surface of the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Turning his arm into the shape of a boat paddle, he tried to stand up properly to cover more distance as he crawled.</p>

  <p>As he did this, the downgrader noticed some red, pale yellow, white lines ahead of him.</p>

  <p>The red lines were blood, the pale yellow lines were flesh, and the white lines were bones. The three different lines were embedded together. These must've been traces from the battle between the Evil God and Luo Zheng. After all, parts of their body were constantly devoured by the Wall World during their hand to hand combat.</p>

  <p>After the downgrader passed by these floating multicolored lines, he stumbled upon another void. The entire chaos expanded thirty billion-fold, so the distance between the center of the chaos and the end of it had also increased by thirty billion times.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrader still managed to close this distance with ease.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a rogue piece of space circled the downgrader, sucking him into it. In a flash, the downgrader had left this void and entered the scope of the former main world. Here, the area was even wider.</p>

  <p>As aforementioned, after a world was completely downgraded, the space would expand by thirty billion times. Therefore, a mountain within the main world could contain an entire chaos.</p>

  <p>But when the main world was downgraded from a fourth-grade space to a second-grade space, all of the spaces within it turned into the size of the Wall World.</p>

  <p>This meant that it had expanded by 0.9 billion trillion times.</p>

  <p>After the downgrader entered the main world, he saw that the color of the lines became complicated.</p>

  <p>All kinds of long, short, green, brown and gray lines were interconnected.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to make out what the lines were previously, so the downgrader could only perceive their energy structures.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, he shuttled back and forth, searching to see if there were any living beings.</p>

  <p>After a new world unfurled, the creatures that appeared were only accessories in the process of downgrading. While his sole mission was to downgrade, killing these so-called "accessories" was a great pleasure for him.</p>

  <p>This kind of pleasure increased day by day, especially in the third-grade world. He even met human beings who were strong enough to defeat him, but in the end, he was always the one who emerged victorious.</p>

  <p>However, upon scouring the second-grade world, he was not used to these desolate-looking lines.</p>

  <p>Just as he was beginning to grow desperate, he suddenly came across a green line moving in front of him.</p>

  <p>"There are creatures!" the downgrader exclaimed, his heart overjoyed.</p>

  <p>He excitedly rushed over towards the seemingly thousands of feet long green line.</p>

  <p>However, as he approached, he realized this green line was equivalent to a small worm less than an inch long in the third-grade world.</p>

  <p>Even so, the downgrader still approached it cautiously, fearing that he would accidentally destroy this green line.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't use his spiritual sense, it was very difficult to communicate in the Wall World.</p>

  <p>The only way to communicate was to manipulate the length of the lines and their colors. Theoretically, this kind of communication was possible, but it was unrealistic to expect a worm-like creature to learn this in so short a time.</p>

  <p>After observing it for a while, the downgrader found that the green line was still slowly wriggling in one direction.</p>

  <p>"It's so boring to watch a worm crawl," he said in disgust.</p>

  <p>The downgrader was a little depressed, but suddenly, Clarence crossed his mind.</p>

  <p>'He surely must still be alive!' he thought excitedly.</p>

  <p>Then, he abruptly flew in a certain direction, shattering the green line in front of him. If he did that in the third-grade world, it would be equivalent to crushing a worm with a single kick.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there was a slight movement in the void darkness.</p>

  <p>It was as if the fireworks swept across the night sky.</p>

  <p>"Wake up.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, wake up!"</p>

  <p>This voice rang out in the depths of Luo Zheng's soul, but Luo Zheng didn't respond at all.</p>

  <p>He had fallen into a state of ignorance, so he no longer had any thoughts, no longer cared about external things, and had cut off all the ways of communication.</p>

  <p>Nothing mattered anymore.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't care about anything.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, he felt a little warm.</p>

  <p>Then, he saw the sun rising, bringing a dazzling light with it. The ray of light seemed to pierce right into his soul.</p>

  <p>The world that Luo Zheng perceived now was distorted and constantly changing, like a painting that was splashed with fresh ink.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng found himself within the paradise-like Immortal Mansion, and joyful laughter rang out from the high wall. The young Salome was struggling to cross the threshold. When she did, she gave him a warm smile.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, father!</p>

  <p>Stop sleeping...</p>

  <p>I don't want to see you get lost!"</p>

  <p>Salome exclaimed sweetly. She had a lovely smile, revealing two dimples on her cheeks, but it should be impossible for her to say these words.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Luo Zheng asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng's attention was successfully caught, the smile on Salome's face disappeared, and she said seriously, "I'm Clarence. I've been calling you.</p>

  <p>Why didn't you answer me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm already dead," Luo Zheng said with some disgust, wrinkling his nose.</p>

  <p>"No, you're not!" Clarence exclaimed in annoyance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still shook his head, trying to resist. "Is this the illusion you created?"</p>

  <p>"Well, strictly speaking, this is my memory. I have all the memories that have extended from the perfect land to here. What you see is the reality I have built using my memories!" Clarence explained.</p>

  <p>"A reality created by memories?" Luo Zheng echoed, in a daze. "Is this really not an illusion?"</p>

  <p>"To your cognition, this is the real world," Clarence replied cryptically.</p>

  <p>As Clarence was the master of the perfect land, his memories were very special.</p>

  <p>Everything in this world was preserved in his memories, which served like trillions of building blocks.</p>

  <p>He only needed to place the blocks according to the original positions in his memories, and then the reality would be constructed. Conversely, if he pushed the blocks down and disordered the memory positions, then the real world would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Then, can you let me stay here for the rest of eternity?" Luo Zheng asked sleepily.</p>

  <p>"Of course... not!"</p>

  <p>Clarence denied Luo Zheng firmly.</p>

  <p>Then, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and the winds began to howl.</p>

  <p>The indestructible Immortal Mansion was shattered into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>Salome also dissolved into a small ball of light, which was the form that Clarence had always assumed when he revealed himself to others.</p>
