  <p>
</p>

  <p>Many regions of stars enveloped Zheng endlessly, where he met each powerhouse of the human race one by one.</p>

  <p>Among these people were Houtu, Queen of the Earth, in charge of everything that revolved around nature, Houyi, who shot the suns with a bow...</p>

  <p>(*TN: Most of these heroes are deities from Chinese mythology and folktales.)</p>

  <p>Though they presented themselves as humans in front of Zheng, most of them were not pure human beings.</p>

  <p>For example, Emperor Charm had demonic blood going through his veins because he was a Sun Crow in nature.</p>

  <p>There was also the Snake Goddess who was half human and half snake, while Wukong was actually a monkey with extraordinary combat effectiveness.</p>

  <p>However, because these beings were all born in the 77th civilization, they all agreed with the human civilization.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the Snake Goddess again, he felt strange.</p>

  <p>He knew the two Snake Goddesses were not the same person, but they could almost be considered one. They both possessed the power to read people's minds.</p>

  <p>"I thought I would be the one to open the temple with the Other Shore Key," the Snake Goddess said to Zheng. "How come it ended up being you?"</p>

  <p>She was referring to the Snake Goddess in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Is this a test?" Zheng responded, smiling at the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Sort of." She shrugged.</p>

  <p>In fact, except Zhurong and Gonggong, other powerhouses didn't really test Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't hide anything; to him, there was nothing worth hiding.</p>

  <p>Very calmly, he told the Snake Goddess how he obtained the last Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, and how he had discovered the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>Once he finished explaining, the Snake Goddess was baffled, "I did not realize I'd not have the patience to obtain the last Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. It's fate. You..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess hesitated and did not finish her sentence.</p>

  <p>After leaving the starry region the Snake Goddess was in, Zheng made his way to enter another starry region, where he met Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the Fuxi before him seemed to be the same as the one in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Hey man," Fuxi called out. "Am I powerful in the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are," Zheng responded lightly.</p>

  <p>In terms of pure strength, most powerful warriors in the Source World were inferior to Fuxi. No one was ever willing to get into a fight with him.</p>

  <p>"Well, how did the woman from the neighboring starry region treat me?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi continued to ask..</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked to hear this, having just seen the Snake Goddess prior to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Under the pressure of Fuxi, Zheng bragged about his position in the Pear Hill before he let him go.</p>

  <p>After Zheng left, a look of confusion spread across Fuxi's face. Among the thirty-nine heroes, Fuxi was the most unwilling to accept his fate. What he thought was surprisingly the same as what the Fuxi in the Source World thought.</p>

  <p>Not long afterwards, Zheng met the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>After both of them finally understood their incarnations' choices in the Source World, they grew to become extremely grim.</p>

  <p>Both the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Thearch were clear about their personality and their incarnations. Once they were determined on their own path, they would have to go on without hesitation. As the real them were trapped on the Other Shore, they couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>Over time, more and more stars swept past Zheng as he met the past powerhouses one by one.</p>

  <p>"The thirty-eighth one..."</p>

  <p>As another starry region enveloped him, he ended up at the top of a cyan mountain. Right before him stood a burly middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>Although the middle-aged man appeared quite different from Chiyou's energy soul Zheng had met, he could still recognize the man at a glance.</p>

  <p>It was known by everyone that Chiyou in the divine land was already dead.</p>

  <p>He was naturally not as imposing as the one in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"My blood is flowing in your body," Chiyou pointed out. "Are you my descendant?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and nodded. "You... You are my grandfather."</p>

  <p>Just then, Chiyou's face shifted from puzzled to ecstatic as he gave Zheng a warm embrace.</p>

  <p>It was after a heated discussion that these powerful masters decided to place the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Before, it was assumed that the Snake Goddess was going to open the temple. However, it ended up being Zheng, Chiyou's grandson. Chiyou said in surprise, "It seems that the Nine Li race has developed well."</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Region was a very strong existence in the 77th civilization, so Chiyou had no doubts of Nine Li race's power.</p>

  <p>"Here's the thing, grandpa. The Nine Li race was destroyed, and you were killed by the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer in the Source World,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, trying to soften the blow with his tone. "Only some members of the race are still alive. Moreover, I've joined the Oneness Sky Palace."</p>

  <p>Chiyou's face stiffened for a moment, but eventually, eased up as he smiled helplessly. "I didn't expect things would go this way, but I am more than proud to hear that you have opened the temple!"</p>

  <p>Chiyou was never one to focus on the negatives. Even after hearing about the tragic ending of the Nine Li race, he was not disgraced. He asked Zheng about many things.</p>

  <p>Among all the stars he visited, Zheng remained with Chiyou the longest. He made sure to tell Chiyou what he had experienced in detail.</p>

  <p>Chiyou never would have guessed that this was the situation in the Source World.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the plan of the human race was very successful. There were many civilizations in the Source World, and this brought an upper hand for the humans of the 77th civilization. Unfortunately, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race ended up betraying everyone, which took them by surprise.</p>

  <p>After a few more hours, Zheng eventually left the Nine Li Region.</p>

  <p>The regions of stars that he'd visited positioned themselves above his head and spiraled around each other. Then the golden region of stars in the center shrouded him.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng fell into the depths of the palace of a golden star. Green jade slips floated in the air, and the words on the slips were never ending.</p>

  <p>Among the slips stood a statue-like being, which turned out to be a real person who faced Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Young man, you can sit down," the man said, gesturing towards the chair right in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," Zheng said, following the man's instruction. It was only then that he'd realized this person was the most important figure among the thirty-nine heroes.</p>

  <p>The man smiled at Zheng, positioned a few jade slips before him, and asked,</p>

  <p>"You are a human, aren't you? Are you interested in the history of the human race?"</p>

  <p>"You mean the human race in the 77th chaos?" Zheng shot back with a question.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the man nodded. "All about the 77th civilization."</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea this was what he was getting into. "Yes, I am more than interested."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the man gently knocked on the jade slips that were resting on the table, and green threads suddenly floated out of them. These threads attached themselves to Zheng's temples, flashing the entire history of the human race into his mind.</p>

  <p>It seemed that even back then, the human race already had many disputes and conflicts.</p>

  <p>Overall, even in the early stages, the 77th chaos had gone through three massive tribulations: the battle of ancestral sorcerers, the battle for becoming gods, and the battle of Taoism and Buddhism.</p>

  <p>It seemed that every tribulation caused much destruction, and Zheng couldn't help but flinch at the sight of these.</p>
