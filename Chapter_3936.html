<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Unlike Claire, these three members of the Element Spirit race didn't have their own forms. They all maintained their original form as Element Spirits.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The one at their helm was a cross-shaped block of solid ice. Its surface shone with a bluish-white luster.</p>

  <p>Beside it was a ball of flames, then the last member's body was made up of several different elements.</p>

  <p>Their bodies constantly changed, so it was hard to distinguish them, unlike Claire, who had a unique form.</p>

  <p>However, they emitted remarkably strong auras that were only slightly weaker than Claire's.</p>

  <p>Pearce and the others found it quite easy to deduce that they were probably part of the big ten of the Grand Plain Stage. "Are you Zheng?" the cross-shaped member of the Element Spirit race asked.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" Zheng said indifferently. Among the humans on the Other Shore, he was the only one in physical form.</p>

  <p>Thus, there was no need for him to hide his identity now.</p>

  <p>"Join us, we can give you three thousand places for survivors after the Purge Way is realized," said the cross-shaped ice.</p>

  <p>Previously, Claire had offered him three hundred places, but he rejected her.</p>

  <p>They increased the offer by ten times after the war with the Pear Hill, which meant that the Element Spirit Civilization's sincerity also intensified by the same value.</p>

  <p>"It's not about the number of places. I've already talked to Claire. Forget about three hundred or three thousand as I won't agree even you offer thirty billion. That is my decision," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Once he had chosen a target, there was no way he would change it.</p>

  <p>The cross-shaped ice in the ball shook slightly then calmly replied, "This is your last chance. If you refuse, we will hunt you to no end in Stage Thirty-three."</p>

  <p>Since the Grand Plain Stage had rules, it could be a good place for many civilizations to live and work in peace and contentment.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the only rule on the Three Purities Stage was strength, and the Element Spirit Civilization was undoubtedly the most powerful force in that place.</p>

  <p>"You have hunted me many times," Zheng said with a shrug. He ignored the three members' threat, then walked past them towards the large ring along with the masters at the Holy Soul Realm of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The three members of the Element Spirit race stared at Zheng for a while.</p>

  <p>They seemed to understand that they couldn't make him change his mind, so they just retreated.</p>

  <p>Claire's failure had also caused immense shock in the Element Spirit Civilization. Thus, both the big ten of the Blood Assembly and the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization became divided into two factions. One thought that they should try their best to kill Zheng, while the other insisted that they should continue to persuade him to join them.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Blood Assembly compromised and decided to convince him one last time, which failed. Therefore, now the Element Spirit Civilization would prioritize killing him.</p>

  <p>After the three members of the Element Spirit race left, Zheng and the others went to the large ring, which was the Stage End Passage Pearce had mentioned.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>The ring embedded in the bronze plain sensed that an Eternal Realm warrior had approached it, and began to rotate automatically.</p>

  <p>"We have to stop here. Only Eternal Realm warriors can step into the Stage End Passage. Once warriors like us step on it, our souls will be gone," said Pearce.</p>

  <p>Such a tragedy had happened before. Back then, some warriors at the Holy Soul Realm and even some with the Myriad Tribulations Bodies tried to pass through the Stage End Passage. As a result, both their bodies and souls became utterly destroyed after the ring sucked them in.</p>

  <p>Therefore, some civilizations and races in the Grand Plain Stage used the ring as a special punishment. They brought those who committed a capital crime to the Stage End Passage for execution.</p>

  <p>"The Stage End Passage represents the Grand Pure Realm, which is the outermost part of the Three Purities Stage. Its high-speed rotation will enable you to appear anywhere at the Grand Pure Realm's periphery. That periphery is also quite dangerous for the warriors in the Eternal Realm, and there are three death lands in it..." Libby kept on elaborating the situation to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Libby, this is the third time that you have explained this to him..." Goran, who was beside her, said with a helpless grin. "Although I haven't entered the Three Purities Stage before, the books state that the Grand Pure Realm is the most dangerous when an Eternal Realm warrior has just entered it,"</p>

  <p>Libby said calmly.</p>

  <p>The Stage End Passage randomly transported the warriors who entered it to any area in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>That way, they could avoid being chased by the forces in the Grand Plain Stage. However, it was extremely difficult for an Eternal Realm warrior to survive alone on the Grand Pure Realm, so the first step was very important.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that Zheng is not an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior," Pearce commented. After all, he was quite confident in Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>"I'm about to enter the Three Purities Stage for the first time, and I'm not familiar with everything. Libby is right to warn me of the danger," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then, he cupped his hands towards the people of the Oneness Sky Palace as a sign of goodbye and stepped towards the Stage End Passage.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped onto the Stage End Passage, he felt his entire body spin at a crazy speed with the ring.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>At that moment, all that Libby, Pearce, and the others saw was a blurry shadow.</p>

  <p>As the Stage End Passage spun faster and faster, the speed at which the Sanskrit words around it changed increased as well. Not long after, the light glowed brightly, and Zheng's figure disappeared in the Stage End Passage.</p>

  <p>Finally, the entire Stage End Passage became still.</p>

  <p>When he got teleported out of the Stage End Passage, he found that it felt similar to his experience in the star ring, but this time, it was much faster.</p>

  <p>His body felt extreme pressure under the violent vibrations.</p>

  <p>It was said that many Eternal Realm masters suffered severe injuries when they entered the Three Purities Stage for the first time.</p>

  <p>But since the ancestry-level bloodline had transformed his body, it was easy for him to endure the pressure.</p>

  <p>The sensation lasted for five minutes before his speed finally slowed down.</p>

  <p>The once blurry surroundings slowly became clear, and everything in his vision was very dark. At the same time, an earthy scent filled his nostrils.</p>

  <p>"Am I in the soil?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he realized that, he immediately shut his mouth.</p>

  <p>Libby had also warned him that when he passed through the Stage End Passage, it might send him to some strange places, like inside a thick layer of earth. Still, he didn't expect to end up in such an odd place when he first entered the Three Purities Stage. It was hard to get out of such a thick layer of soil!</p>

  <p>"It's better to land inside the layer of earth than in the death lands. It would be quite troublesome if you ended up in the death lands," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "I've been inside the layer of earth twice before. Please light up this place and let me see how deep you are," he added.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng tried hard to stretch his body and forcefully opened up space within the soil.</p>

  <p>As he raised his hand, a dull white light spread out from his palm and illuminated the small space.</p>

  <p>The soil around him was soft, and it seemed that it was soaked in blood as copious amounts of thick, red liquid kept seeping out. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, how deep am I now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven hesitated for a moment then said, "This is… the Diabolic Earth. You should be in the underground of the Land of Diabolic Demons."</p>
