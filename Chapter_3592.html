<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Elephant Man race, no one knew the origin of the Heavenly Spirit Bead, except for the high priest.</p>

  <p>As for the actual use of the Heavenly Spirit Bead, no one knew either.</p>

  <p>But since the high priest had given the order, Richie didn't dare refuse.</p>

  <p>Stepping outside, he headed straight for the totem pole and began to climb it.</p>

  <p>"Chief..."</p>

  <p>"You...!"</p>

  <p>"That's our sacred treasure! How dare you!"</p>

  <p>The other Elephant Men had come out of their homes to see what their chieftain was doing. To their horror, they saw he was headed straight for their treasured Heavenly Spirit Bead.</p>

  <p>"It's our mission to take down the sacred treasure," the high priest suddenly said, emerging from the massive house.</p>

  <p>In the Elephant Man race, the word of the high priest was considered the law. Most of the time, however, the high priest left the chieftain to manage everything.</p>

  <p>"Why?" an Elephant Man asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"Because the reason why the sacred treasure stays here," the high priest said seriously, "is to wait for some creatures to arrive. And now... They have arrived."</p>

  <p>"Your Holiness, are you referring to those two humans?" another Elephant Man asked.</p>

  <p>The high priest nodded.</p>

  <p>The high priest had been very clear since the beginning that the Elephant Man race was insignificant. They had but one mission, and before it was completed, they might have had some reason to exist.</p>

  <p>However, upon completion of this mission, they would become dispensable.</p>

  <p>The outcome could be imagined, but that didn't matter; they only knew they needed to obey.</p>

  <p>Once the chieftain handed over the Heavenly Spirit Bead, Murkub set it on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Elephant Men stared at the Heavenly Spirit Bead, eyes gleaming. Only the high priest could activate the power of the Heavenly Spirit Bead.</p>

  <p>Everyone wondered what was going to happen.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was guessing what sort of power the high priest was going to unleash, Murkub suddenly grabbed the stone spear that was strapped to Richie's back.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he had swung the stone spearhead onto the Heavenly Spirit Bead.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>"Your Holiness!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, even Richie was stunned, but he dared not stop him. He could do nothing but watch as Murkub slammed the spear onto their treasured bead.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Finally, the Heavenly Spirit Bead shattered into transparent white shards.</p>

  <p>All the Elephant Men stared at the remnants in absolute shock. Was the high priest crazy?</p>

  <p>Just as panic began to well within their hearts, the white fragments scattered on the ground suddenly started to tremble.</p>

  <p>These white fragments might've been very small compared to the Elephant Man race, but the Heavenly Spirit Bead itself was around 700 to 800 feet in diameter. Each fragment was around the size of an ordinary human's fist.</p>

  <p>As the white fragments continued to move, they gradually began to form a circular array. Then, all the white fragments released powerful energy, activating a unique array!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A white light shot straight into the sky from the grassland.</p>

  <p>Not far from the Elephant Men's settlement, Zheng and Elvinia had been trudging through the grassland. To their surprise, they suddenly saw a white beam of light in the distance.</p>

  <p>"It's from the territory of the Elephant Man race," said Elvinia seriously.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem like someone is ascending." Zheng pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>The white light that went up was somewhat similar to the star ring. It hadn't been long since they had left the Elephant Men's settlement. This couldn't be a coincidence.</p>

  <p>"It's probably because of the Other Shore Key in your hands," Elvinia surmised.</p>

  <p>According to the Elephant Man race, the dangerous place at the edge of the grassland was no secret. At least those great forces knew the existence of this place. It was just that they couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>"Most likely." Zheng looked at the white light expressionlessly, and the light gradually dissipated and disappeared from his sight. "We have to hurry..."</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, his thunder wings roared to life. Wrapping his arm around Elvinia's waist, together they flew across the vast grassland like lightning.</p>

  <p>The white light continued to rise until it reached Stage Eighteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>On the top of a high mountain of Stage Eighteen, there was a small magic array. The moment the white light entered Stage Eighteen, this array also released a white light, which shot towards Stage Nineteen.</p>

  <p>In turn, in a valley of Stage Nineteen, a small array was activated.</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty...</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty-one...</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty-two...</p>

  <p>Stage Thirty...</p>

  <p>Stage Thirty-one...</p>

  <p>Stage Thirty-two!</p>

  <p>Inside a huge hall, there was a massive metal array.</p>

  <p>The metal array rotated continuously. As all kinds of patterns intertwined, a terrifying energy surged within it.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>When the white light entered Stage Thirty, the metal array trembled violently.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?"</p>

  <p>A little ball of light made a strange sound.</p>

  <p>Inside the ball, there was a blue wave of water light. The water light condensed and formed intricate ice crystals.</p>

  <p>It was a member of the Element Spirit race, and just so happened to be the weakest water spirit in this race. That was why it was sent here, to guard the metal array.</p>

  <p>'The array of Stage Seventeen has been activated? What happened on Stage Seventeen?' the water spirit pondered.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the members of the Element Spirit race would only pay attention to Stage Twenty-nine and above. There was nothing worth their attention below Stage Twenty-nine.</p>

  <p>A few days ago, there was news that there were purified beings within Stage Fourteen, and the two purified beings were of the human race.</p>

  <p>Even so, the Element Spirit race only issued an imperial edict to let those humble black monkeys take action. The Element Spirit race did not take any further action, because they had deemed it unnecessary.</p>

  <p>However, that happened not too long ago. Now, their guards in Stage Seventeen had activated the magic array. Naturally, the water spirit was curious.</p>

  <p>Stage Seventeen...</p>

  <p>'Could it be because of that dangerous place?'</p>

  <p>The blue light suddenly spread out from the body of the water spirit.</p>

  <p>This flashing blue light served as a signal, telling its companions that it had some news.</p>

  <p>The members of the Element Spirit race had the ability to fuse with each other. The moment they called out to their companions, their voices would automatically adjust to be heard.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in an instant, all the members of the Element Spirit race who could respond to the water spirit gathered in its body.</p>

  <p>Within the little orb of light, dazzling golden lights and blazing flames appeared.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"This seems to be news coming from a low stage..."</p>

  <p>"Humph! It's only Stage Seventeen. Did you really need to call everyone here?"</p>

  <p>Naturally, the other members of the Element Spirit race grew impatient.</p>

  <p>The water spirit didn't say anything. It let the metal array speak for itself.</p>

  <p>As the metal array continued to rotate, a blurry picture appeared in front of everyone. In the picture, it was the high priest of the Elephant Man race, Murkub.</p>

  <p>The transmission of information was very complicated on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Even the Element Spirit race who had a thorough understanding of the Other Shore could only pass through the transmission stage by stage.</p>

  <p>After having to go through so many stages, it was already amazing in itself that the array was able to show the picture of the Elephant Man.</p>
